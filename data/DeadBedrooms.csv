1360286832.0,167,self.DeadBedrooms,183pmg,Things I've learned from 1 year on r/deadbedrooms,198,31,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/183pmg/things_ive_learned_from_1_year_on_rdeadbedrooms/,"After a year on this sub and reading everyone's else posts as well as my own situation, I've compiled a list of things I've learned. These are just my opinion, I don't claim to be an expert or anything. My experiences also include me being active in the dating scene and having a sex life aside from the dead bedroom, so I have that extra perspective.

* Either your partner wants to have sex or they don't. That's a gross over-simplification but it's the bottom line. Don't believe excuses like ""If I wasn't so tired from working all day..."" People generally find a way to do the things they want to do. Don't focus your efforts into fixing ""If it wasn't for X we could have more sex..."" because X isn't really the problem.

* It's important to find out what priority (if any) your partner places on sex. Being LL is one thing, but if they think that sex isn't that important and there's no need to have it regularly in a relationship then your road to recovery will be extremely difficult if not impossible. Oftentimes we end up in a paradox where sex is extremely important, except when it isn't - you don't have sex right away, it has to be ""earned"", it's a special act, and they'd be outraged if you had sex with anyone else for whatever the reason, but when it comes to the two of you it's just not that important.

* The LL partner has to want to change. This means that they recognize there is a problem and they're willing to take steps to fixing it. For most of us, having the talk and saying how much this situation hurts us should be enough reason, but many times it's not. Especially if we remain caring, loving, and supportive partners - their only consequence for not changing is to have to deal with ""the talk"" every few months, which they can get out of by making empty promises, shutting down, or getting angry/defensive. We have to be willing to give them real incentive to change, even if that includes separation/divorce.

* Anti-depressants and birth control can kill a healthy libido. If your partner is on meds and experiencing a reduced libido you should consult with your doctor. There are many other hormonal factors that can wreck a person's desire to have sex.

* If you discover that you and your partner are sexually incompatible and there's nothing tying you down you should be willing to leave. Sexual incompatibility is a more than valid reason to end a relationship. It's nothing you should feel ashamed about. Even if the relationship is perfect otherwise this one thing is enough to wreck the harmony. If you aren't sexually compatible but leaving isn't really an option then you should be willing to consider more unorthodox solutions.

* Your partner's decreased libido isn't necessarily your fault. Don't take it so hard. No matter what your current condition is there's probably some one out there who'd be into you. That having been said physical appearance and behavorial changes can turn people off. If you aren't happy with who you are then take steps to fix things. 

* On the flipside, don't cause a dead bedroom because you're not happy with who you are and assume your partner feels the same way. 

* When dating there is a subtle preparation aspect to sex. When you meet up there's an unspoken expectation of sex, and as such both parties prepare appropriately. Both mentally and physically. Upon moving in that aspect tends to get lost. Many LL/RL partners need this buildup, which is part of the reason why sex can take a sharp downturn after moving in together. Personally I feel that libido is more psychological than physiological - wanting sex mentally leads to wanting it physically as well. If you only wait for your body to crave sex it will lead to a natural decrease in sex.

* For most HL partners we're not just looking for a quick orgasm with a person. We want the intimacy, closeness, and validation that comes with physical affection. LL partners may not need this, or at least not as frequently. So simply saying ""give me more sex!"" isn't a solution. The problem is that we want our partners to desire us more often.

1362153550.0,160,self.DeadBedrooms,19gtzc,I miss sex.,201,41,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19gtzc/i_miss_sex/,"Just me venting again.

I really miss sex. And when I say sex, I'm not just talking about P in the V until I'm done. That's not what sex is to me. Sex is an experience that stimulates my five senses in a way that no other experiences can.

It's the moment I know we're going to be having sex within a few minutes/hours. Perhaps we're making out and I put a hand on her breast or move it up her thigh and she doesn't try and stop me. Or as I do she moves into it, encouraging it. A slightly, almost involuntary moan of pleasure. As if that area had been waiting to be touched for an eternity and in doing so I set off a chain reaction in her body. Sometimes it's just a look on her face, or even a verbal cue. Every time it causes my heart to skip a beat.

It's seeing her take her clothes off, shedding layers of protection until only the bare skin is left. Seeing her on top of me, admiring her body and her sexuality. Seeing her below me with a look in her eyes that I can't possibly describe - somewhere between pure desire and on the path to fulfillment.

It's the slightly salty taste of sweat from her neck and arms, sometimes with light perfume mixed in. The taste of her stomach and back and thighs. And of course the taste of her - sweet, distinctive. The more the better.

It's the sounds. Oh the sounds! The moans, the cries, the grunts. The little gasp of air upon first penetration. The heavy breathing and panting. The sound of her heart racing after we collapse on top of each other. The sound of music or traffic outside or whatever else was going on in the world, coming flooding back after being completely oblivious to it.

The feel of her body against mine, the warmth and the soft dampness as we work up a sweat. To feel her arms grip around me, her nails scratching down my back. The feel of her body losing control within my caress or my kiss. The feeling of hyper-awareness afterwards as we lay down together and touch each other and embrace. 

When I say I want sex, this is what I want. Telling me to masturbate as a solution is almost offensive. Masturbation can't compare, not even close. You might as well tell a starving man to eat a stick of gum and be fulfilled with that. Pity sex is the same. It's not sex at all to me. My wife could offer me pity sex 7 days a week and I'd still be unsatisfied - it's just glorified masturbation. I want sex, dammit.

I dunno, maybe people who feel the same way I do are in the minority. Everything seems to revolve around PIV. Our LL partners don't seem to get it. They're just not interested and they don't care to be. Maybe it really is my problem. If only I could be happy with PIV, or even DIY. Life would be much more simple.

But I love sex. It's a part of who I am. I can't shut it off, nor do I want to. And you tell me that now one person in the whole world - the one person who I wanted to share this amazing experience with - now has the right to deny me this? It's not fair. And I refuse to just sit there and take it. Life's too short for that.

But yeah. I miss sex. Great sex. Sex that makes you feel alive.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_19gtzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19gtzc/i_miss_sex/,

 Maybe not so dead as some of those in here, maybe worse than others. It didn't matter that others had it worse or better, this was my bedroom. What used to be the chamber of echoing primal screams was now a room dimly lit by a flickering TV with the accompanying soundtrack of the gentle snore of my beautiful wife.
 
 It started as many deaths do, not with a skidding crash, but little bit by little bit. Passionate kisses on the way out the door gave way to pecks in the hallway as we made oatmeal for the kid and got her ready for school. Nights cuddled up on the couch with wandering hands gave way to checking homework, checking emails, flipping laundry and working out bills.
 
 It was not my fault. It was not hers. Life simply changed. When we got together, we were teenagers and our to-do list for the day consisted of meeting our herb guy, going to blockbuster and if I was really trying to get something accomplished, getting a money order for rent. We fucked like rabbits and enjoyed it. We laid naked in bed until late in the afternoon if we wanted to, and we wanted to often. 
 
 Now, as thirty-somethings, on a given Saturday, our to-do list must be prioritized and divvied up between us so that we even had a chance of fitting in going to the kid's friends' birthday party, getting a new AC filter from Home Depot, fixing that downspout that keeps popping a seam every time it rains, making sure we get to the farmers market for the local honey that keeps our daughter's allergies at bay, and still try to leave time for the dishes, laundry and detritus that accumulates as if with a mind of it's own.
 
 We were tired. No, tired is a luxury afforded to those who remember what it's like to not be tired. We were dead tired. The idea of sex, passion and tenderness seemed like an unimportant  distant memory, like a that thingamajig that sits in the junk drawer in the kitchen.
 
 We knew we were supposed to hang on to it, but for the life of us couldn't remember exactly what it was for. So it sat in the drawer, not forgotten but just unused.
 
 Neither of us felt that the other was doing their part, only because we couldn't see everything the other person was doing to try to keep the boat afloat. We weren't even trying to fix the boat, just keep on bailing out water until our arms were limp.
 
 It had to stop. I wasn't happy, she wasn't happy. We were both good, kind people. We deserved to be happy.
 
 So I came up with a plan. A daring, throw-caution-to-the-wind plan. A Utah beach in Normandy on June 6th kind of plan.
 
 I was going to become a superhuman cleaning machine. I would push my limits of domestic ability. When I came home tired, and all I wanted (and deserved) to do was sit down on the couch, collapse, open a diet coke and watch the antics of Paul and Jaime Buchman, I would resist.
 
 I did dishes, flipped laundry, helped with math homework, swept, mopped, vacuumed, cleaned mirrors, scrubbed toilets. All with the reckless abandon of a crazy person. I'd listen to entire albums in my headphones while I put armies of cleaning crews to shame. 
 
 I'd bring her her tablet and a glass of wine and make sure she relaxed. Her smile was the reward. I wasn't looking for sex, or a blow job, or even a hand job. I was looking for her smile.
 
 I got it.

 Soon, my get-home-and-clean routine became second nature. It was just a part of the day. I got faster at it, and things improved. She saw that I was putting in the effort to make her life easier, and I saw her appreciation. Appreciation turned to affection, affection turned to attraction and before I knew it, we were spending time together.
 
 Not just in the same room, but together. We talked about things that we hadn't talked about in years, discussing ideas and opening up to each other. We connected better. We wanted to be around each other, and we craved each other.
 
 In conclusion, it turned out that all it took to revive the dead bedroom was persistence and a little elbow grease.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_t5nn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/t5nn9/how_i_learned_to_resurrect_a_dead_bedroom_or_the/,

First, the obligatory: F/42 married 17 years to M/44, no kids, last had sex 22 months ago.  Longest stretch previous to this was one year.  And the year thing has happened more than once.  Five times maybe?

The other day one of you said something like: it's been a year and a half, I stopped keeping track, can you imagine that?

I don't have to imagine it, I live it.

And I guess that's where the Universe comes in because in the last week or so, every time I come here, I feel like one of you is reading my diary.

So, before I go on with the wall of text, I want to say something: to those of you whose story is something like: 20 something, dating six months..., or married two years, no kids..., or dating X years, about to get married...

GET THE FUCK OUT.  YOU ARE STARING AN IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCE RIGHT IN THE FACE.

There's a story, maybe you've heard it, about an immovable object and an unstoppable force.  Most people think when these two meet there is an explosion of some sort.  That is not the case.  When the object refuses to move and the force refuses to stop, the only allowable outcome is ORBIT.  And the only two ways to get out of orbit are (A) achieve escape velocity or (B) crash and fucking burn.

If you've been at this six months, a year, maybe two, escape velocity is a lot easier than you think it is.  TRUST ME, I've been at this almost two decades.  But s/he loves me, s/he gets me, s/he is perfect in every other way - yeah, yeah, yeah, been there, done that.  At 17 years with no kids and no mortgage it has taken me two years to build enough momentum just to google divorce lawyers.  Add kids and a mortgage?  I get why you stay.  And seriously, I want to hug each one of you right now.

So, the why.  Because I'm crazy.  Because I'm stubborn.  Because I was in love.  Because I thought I was loved.  Because I thought I could fix it if I was just SOMETHING, ANYTHING, enough.  Pretty enough, sexy enough, smarty enough, funny enough.  You know what I am after all these years of trying to be enough?  AWESOME.  I'M FUCKING AWESOME.  And you know what else?

It was never enough.

Because I was never the problem.  Unfortunately, it took far too long to figure that out.

Every moment that I am not doing something, I am thinking about sex.  Lemme tell ya, this girl can conjure a motherfucking fantasy.  And it's all great until I think what if this were really happening to me?  I'd probably freak out and run away crying.  I'm 40 fucking 2 years old, I was in my 20's the last time I was on a date.  Since then Girls Went Wild and 14 year old girls in Alabama gave up anal to keep their virginity.  I CAN'T COMPETE ON THIS LEVEL.  I don't even know if I remember how to kiss.

(BRB, sobbing)

The toll it takes on your self-esteem IS why you stay.   A few months ago I did something on reddit I had never done before: I messaged one of you.  Our conversation was about this fear we shared, this stupid stupid fear that our choices were literally stay in this miserable relationship or be forever alone.  There was a time when I TRULY believed that I was not worth more than this, because if I was I would have more than this, and I don't.  Who the fuck thinks like that?  Broken people, that's who.

A dead bedroom is the most vicious cycle of all.  The reason you share your bedroom with someone is because they are your significant other, but they don't share that bedroom with you.  So you start compromising.  I don't know how it went for you, but I had to make ""appointments.""  Me: Can we have sex next Thursday, would that work for you?  Him: Um, ok.  And then Thursday would roll around, 9PM, 10PM, 11PM.  Like maybe if he waited long enough I'd give up and go to sleep.  Then he started asking for rain checks.  Then I stopped making appointments.

Best. Thing. I. EVER. Did.

I mean, no it did nothing to improve our sex life, in fact it's been all down hill ever since, but WOW, did it ever wipe a bunch of stress out of my life.  I didn't have to work up the nerve to make the appointment, I didn't have to spend X days wondering if he'd remember the appointment, I didn't have to spend the entire day of wondering how he'd weasel out of the appointment - it was awesome, and the only thing I had to do to achieve such amazing awesomeness was GIVE UP SEX.

Broken.

Compromise becomes surrender.  Hope becomes cope.  This is your life and you don't know how to stop it, everything just spins around you, change is this thing that happens to other people, entire weeks, months slip by and there you are in your broken little rut thinking this will never change and you know this to be true because in all these years nothing ever has.  Every promise a lie.  Every single one.

So you pour yourself a drink, or roll a joint, or whatever it is you need to do, and try not to cry while you masturbate.

Rinse, repeat.

So, yeah, 22 months.  The reason it's been 22 months is because 22 months ago I decided I was never going to do that to myself again.  I probably would have had more comfortable sex with a complete stranger.  Awkward, awful, passionless.  Done.

Honestly, I'm not really sure why I'm here today except to say I can't keep this behind my teeth any longer.  This morning the words ""I want a divorce"" sat on the tip of my tongue, I wasn't even nervous.  My BFF is the one freaking: OMG you can't say that til you talk to a lawyer! and I know she's right - I have 4 numbers at my fingertips but I can't make my fingertips press the numbers on my phone.

Escape Velocity.  I need momentum.  Or a kick in the ass.  Or for someone to throw me off this fucking cliff before I waste another decade contemplating the leap.

DON'T BE ME.  If you have to ask yourself, should I stay or should I go, GO.  Go while you can.  Go while inertia is still on your side.  Go while you can still fire your engines.  Because me?  I need a Saturn V Rocket, all of NASA, and the Curiosity Mohawk guy to help get me off the ground.

But I'm gonna do it, I promise you.  This crazy girl will not crash and burn.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_zf86q,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/zf86q/to_all_the_broken_ones/,

Do yourself a favor and get out while your lives are not too intertwined. If you stay, you will look back with regret. It is not going to change for more than a couple of months, and you will always feel that your SO is doing you a favor when they condescend to have sex with you. It will never be emotionally satisfying because you will always know that it is a chore for them; just something that has to be done, like servicing the car or doing the dishes.
     
 I have been married for 20 years to a man who has little to no sexual attraction towards me. On the surface, our relationship looks perfect: We live in a 4,000sq. ft. house in a beautiful neighborhood, I drive a new car, our kids are happy and well adjusted. My husband is successful, thoughtful and a great father. He is aging well and has a great body (he works out daily). I also look pretty good for my age, and often catch men looking at me. I truly love him, and I am sure that he loves me. Our friends and family think we are a great couple. But every morning I wake up with tears in my eyes. 
  
My husband has always had very little interest in me as a woman, and has sex with me as a sort of 'marital maintenance', every couple of weeks if I am lucky. It is perfunctory, with little foreplay, and If I come once we are done. It has always been this way. When we were dating, I thought it was because of his religious upbringing (even though he was no longer religious)- I thought that subconsciously he might have been put off by the fact that we were 'sinning' and that it would improve after marriage. Nope. I've talked, discussed and begged. Nope.  I tried sexy lingerie, I worked out like a fiend, I tried romantic dinners and seduction, I bought books on kindling desire, etc. etc.. Nope.  
  
So here I am after 20 years, still hurting over the same thing, with my femininity bruised and battered, living with a man who treats me like his favorite sister. I am waiting 5 more years for the kids to get a little older, then I am out. I would leave now, but that would involve selling our house and moving our kids to a crappy school district, which I am not willing to do. I figure I have put up with it for 20 years, what's another 5? I wish I had known in the beginning what I know now.

TL;DR: RUN! If they don't want you now, they won't want you later. It doesn't get any better.

(Then I really am gone)",123,22,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/194ov8/by_request_before_i_go_how_we_overcame_our_db/,"I recently submitted a post explaining why I was unsubscribing to this sub... including that my DB is gone, and with good momentum. Several people asked for my experience before I go, so here it is FWIW.

We were both 30, together for 7 years, when my wife had an affair. Our problems had actually started several years before, but neither of us acknowledged it. Basically, I would constantly pressure her for sex, until it became an obligation for her, something unpleasant. She avoided it more and more. And the more she avoided it, the more I wanted it. What's more, I had a porn habit that drove me to ever more extreme stimulation. By the time we hit rock bottom, we couldn't just have sex, it had to be extreme in some way. We'd go to fetish parties, or gender play, or have group sex with another couple, or whatever. On paper, we had an incredible, fun sex life. But inside it was awful.

At this point we had a crisis in our marriage that made us re-examine whether we wanted to be together at all. I'll be honest, it was a difficult decision that took months to come to, and a lot of soul searching. Ultimately I decided that if it could work with anyone, it would have to be this woman. We are just extremely compatible in so many ways, it was worth fighting through the shit we had always ignored. 

I think one of the hardest parts of a DB is that the focus is on the sex. Maybe that's a typical male focus, maybe it's just because it's such a visible symptom. But it is just a symptom. When we acknowledged the problems and decided to come back together, our DB started. It was the same situation I had been living in before, but instead of crazy fetish sex to try and fill our needs, there was just no sex, ever. The crazy sex filled life I'd had before was a lie we made ourselves, to try feel better about our dead relationship. The DB was actually an improvement in a big way - at least we were being honest.

So we started into couples therapy, as well as seeing the same therapist as individuals. We knew we had a lot of shit to get through before we could start on the sex, but I still talked about sex every week at my session because it was a huge deal to me. It always felt like the big looming thing in my mind. But thankfully my wife used her time to work on her own issues.

So here are the key ""ahas"" for me that got us out of this terrible situation.

* **A DB is a symptom of a dead relationship**. You can be a nice team, but you're just roommates. Emotional closeness and romantic connection naturally creates sexual tension, which naturally leads to sex. If you want your partner to desire you, you have to save your relationship first.

* **Recognise your sexual scripts**. We had the same sexual ""script"" that we would play out over and over again. It boils down to me asking, her saying no, and me pouting. Over time that script gets more and more embedded, until it happens on an emotional level even without words. So I would initiate kissing and cuddling, and she would read that as a sexual advance. Then she would push me away as a way of saying 'no', and I would pout. That embedded script starts to appear everywhere, and it becomes a wedge between you. What kind of a relationship can you have if you can't hold each other? What kind of a relationship can you have if every romantic overture reads as aggressive pressure? The answer is, none. 

It's worth noting that this script can happen regardless of relative libidos. I really like grapes. My wife wakes me up in the morning with grapes in bed, which is honestly pretty awesome. Then I get up, and she offers me grapes with breakfast. OK, that's fine. She calls me at work to ask if I want some grapes, and I'm starting to get sick of it. By the time dinner rolls around, every second comment is a joke about grapes, or an offer of grapes, and I'm just fucking sick of it. That night, THE LAST FUCKING THING I WANT IS ANOTHER FUCKING GRAPE. And I *really* like grapes! This is exactly the way the sexual script built up between us, two people who really like sex.

* **Once you recognise your sexual scripts, you have to break them**. That script is poison, not just to your sex life, but to your relationship as a whole. Our therapist was very helpful here, but the biggest breakthrough outside of the therapy room was the Masters and Johnson [Sex Ban](http://www.thedirtynormal.com/2010/07/15/real-pink-viagra-3-stop-having-sex/). We explicitly agreed not to have sex for an indefinite period of time. With that agreement in place, we could directly attack the awful script (that dirtynormal calls the ""chasing dynamic""). I would actually say to her ""it's ok, I'm not initiating or expecting anything. I just want to hold you for a bit."" or ""I just want to make out for a bit."" Gradually, over the course of months, the wall came down. You know the wall I'm talking about - the wall that comes up the moment your partner senses that maybe you might maybe potentially be thinking about wanting to have sex. The wall that shuts them off emotionally and physically, and screams ""NO"" at the top of its lungs. That wall. Miraculously, when you both KNOW that no one is having sex, there's nothing for the wall to guard against, and it starts to disappear. I've learned that it's like this for a lot of defence behaviours - take away the thing their defending against, and the defence itself gradually disappears.

* **Get your chemistry back**. Once you've broken the script, (and you have to keep it broken!), get your damn chemistry back. That spark between you that you haven't felt in ages. Make jokes with a twinkle in your eye, go out and flirt together. Be cuddly in public. This takes a long time to get back, but it's wonderful when it's there. 

  * The free site marriagebuilders.com is EXCELLENT for this. There are tons of fantastic articles about building your relationship, and especially about building your relationship after traumatic experiences. I find their terminology hokey, but the actual advice is fantastic. Make &gt;15 hours a week to do things out of the house together, where you can share an experience and focus on each other. Just go and read the articles, it's great stuff for getting your chemistry back.

 * Take a dance class together. I hated dancing. I was bad at it, and frankly, it seemed like sissy stuff. But in looking for fun activities to do together, and hobbies to share, it was a pretty easy one to take up. Holy shit, guys, I can't recommend this strongly enough. Ballroom dance is about sexual chemistry and connection. For an hour or two a week, you go somewhere and have someone guide you to build connection and chemistry and spark. You have romantic/sexy music, you make sex movements with your body, and you feel each other completely. This more than anything else, holy fuck.

 * Do the Male Action Plan thing from Married Man Sex Life. It doesn't solve everything on its own, but it doesn't hurt to be sexy! It really DOES boost your confidence, and makes you more attractive.

 * Read No More Mister Nice Guy. It's one thing to break the script of sexual ""chasing"", but it's some next-level shit to dive into the psychological roots of it, and find that script all over your relationship. No More Mister Nice Guy helped me see what my wife had been trying to tell me for years - I was needy, an emotional hose on her. I had no idea. This was extraordinary for me.

 * Take control of your own sexual needs, rather than constantly asking her for it. Masturbate. Do it when you need it, and have fun with it. Buy yourself sex toys. Fantasize. Flirt with other women. DON'T FUCK ANYONE ELSE but allow other women to express their attraction to you, and enjoy that. It helps keep you from being a sexual dependent. Oddly enough, I'm finding that I can ask for sex without being a dependent. Still working this one out, though. :)

 * Take up a new hobby or two. Your partner can join you if they like, but this is your hobby. It helps you be interesting and have something new in your life, and it will give you something under YOUR OWN CONTROL that you can use to feel good about yourself. You know, so you aren't always turning to your partner for that validation. 

 * Do the /r/pornfree thing. Masturbate as much as you like, but stop using pornography for it. You'll notice a huge change in your sex drive, a great increase in your self-control, and a huge change in your attitudes and desires about sex. This will help you get back to a healthy sexual mindset.

 * Do the 5 love languages thing. There's a similar set of exercises on marriagebuilders.com which is also good. Figure out how to talk frankly and dispassionately about your own needs, and learn to fulfil hers. One big deal for me was when things had calmed down, we discovered that we both wanted sex more or less the same amount, 2-3x/week. This, from the woman who had turned me down at every turn for 7 years! It blew me away. The reality is that she had a perfectly fine libido... I WAS JUST TURNING HER OFF. 

That's basically it. After just under 2 years, I'm a better, happier, healthier person than I think I have ever been. I'm learning not to be a dependent, and I'm overcoming the patterns of people-pleasing which I've had since I was a child. I own my own sexual needs, and they do not define me. I'm learning to actually express the things I want, rather than constantly focusing on giving someone else pleasure so they validate me.

And it feels good, man. We're not done yet. For a long time I would track our sex life on a calendar, and after 3 months of averaging 1.5x/wk and gradually feeling better and better about it, I stopped. At this point I'm trying to focus on the chemistry and let the sex grow organically.

Mostly, it was over and done with in less than 15 minutes but I thought- that's okay, he's a kind and decent man. Sex isn't everything in a relationship. The issues with Erectile Dysfunction were starting to appear, but I thought nothing of it at the time.

I mean you weren't very keen (twice a week for you was apparently some kind of record). Really? We were in our late twenties, young, fit, no drugs/alcohol. 

I tried to make it more pleasurable for you by dressing up, tried to get you to like kissing (but you hated that), tried to find out about what you liked and didn't like. Problem was, you'd always just shrug your shoulders and say ""I don't know."" I tried finding out your 5 Love Languages for us to grow together but I remember you dismissing it as unnecessary. After one try at Viagra, you hated it because it gave you a headache. 

After 1 solid year of not sleeping together, I suggested couples counselling which you flatly refused. I begged, I cried, I got angry, I tried talking, I tried toys and affirming that I have an open mind to porn- nothing worked. I tried to give you space as I understood this was frustrating you too. 

But you just hunkered down into Denial/Downplay and hoped that in time..the problem would just go away on its own. But it never did.

You broke my heart every time I laid next to you, every single birthday and anniversary celebrated and you didn't want me. You broke my heart when you refused to deal with this and every single time we would 'try' and inevitably your body said NO.

I felt so worthless, rejected and unwanted. In turn, I had to suppress that part of me that longed to be close to you otherwise I didn't know how to cope. I slowly watched my future dreams of marriage and kids with you crumble to dust.   

After 2.5 years of DB I ran so you couldn't reject me anymore. I ran because if you had loved me, I wouldn't have to resort to threats to get you to WANT to change. And now, you've met someone else whilst I painfully pick up the pieces of my soul.

If I'm 'too busy' to do what she wants, when she wants it, then she's perfectly justified in saying 'no' to sex because she's tired, or wants to watch TV or just wants to relax. She stated flat out that she didn't find sex relaxing.

I told her that, I think her reasons are valid. 'No' means 'No' after all.

I also told her that I thought she was comparing apples to oranges. That taking out the garbage was, IMO, on a different level of importance than sex. She responded that they were the same type of thing.

So there I have it, my wife views sex as a **chore**. When I ask for sex, I'm 'pressuring' her. When she refuses and I go to take care of myself, that's trying to make her feel guilty.

I told her that trying to initiate sex wasn't 'pressuring' her. It's *trying to initiate sex*. I can't automatically know when she's in the mood or hell, when she's not in the mood but won't feel 'pressured.' I'm not the Amazing Karnac.

I feel that she doesn't even remotely try to understand my point of view. She has her needs and *only* her needs matter. Sex? It's fine if  she wants it, but only if she wants it. Otherwise its pressuring. The fact that I want it more than her, in her own words last night, ""BFD"".

I told her several times last night that I thought she was a great mother and a good person. I also told her that I wouldn't 'pressure' her for sex again. 

The kicker? Things had improved. We'd improved from a yearlong abstinence (only broken when her sister and our counselor found out) to once a month to twice a month.

And now I know it's a chore.

The good news is that I've lost a lot of fat and gained a goodly amount of muscle. The Starting Strength workout is a great program for getting fit without spending hours in the gym.

The sex picked up when I lost ten pounds. Maybe she'll actually be attracted to me if I lose another ten or so.

If not, maybe someone else will be.

Tell him while on your honeymoon that you feel obligated to have sex. The fist time wasn't what you expected, even though you were both virgins, so why try anymore?
2. Keep ignoring the problem. Make excuses that you don't have high self-esteem, but then refuse to do anything about it. Don't let him help, and don't let him fool you into getting counseling. He just wants sex... He doesn't really care about you.
3. When he tries to bring up sex and talk about the issue, get defensive, and make sure you let him know that you're feeling attacked. Don't let his use of ""when you do X, it makes me feel X"" fool you. What he really means is that you're broken.
4. Don't read the books he gets you about marriage and sex to make your marriage better. Who needs to feel loved and connected to their spouse?! All you need is a warm body to cuddle with, someone to complain to, and someone to fix all of the financial problems you've gotten yourself into.
5. Fondle him and then with hold sex. When he asks you why you do that, say ""I don't know,"" or just shrug and walk off.
6. When he asks for sex because he's lonely and doesn't feel loved or appreciated, and feels like he's not attractive to you, say ""OK"". Then proceed with avoidance patterns. Get on your phone while in bed, so that you can ignore him. Get on Pinterest. Act like you're not tired yet; don't go to bed, because he's probably waiting there to have be sexually intimate with you because you told him you would. Just go lay on the couch and fall asleep. He's so needy!
7. When you do give in and have sex, just lay their like a cold fish. If he takes too long, tell him so, and act frustrated. This is a chore! Don't let him try and get you aroused, and definitely don't try to be into it. All he wants is your vagina. He doesn't long for an emotional connection with you! Sex is all about his physical needs!
8. When he acts upset, withdraws emotionally, and stops kissing you, doesn't hold your hand, and can barely be in the same room with you anymore, ask him what's wrong. But DO NOT think about all those times he told you he needs sexual intimacy with you to feel connected to you. It MUST be something different! If he *does* tell you the same thing AGAIN, just blow it off. That's not the REAL reason he's acting this way. He just THINKS he needs sex.

I know that's not the worst, but still not OK) and our sex life before that was frankly somewhat uninspired.

What happened - I realized I would not be able to live with myself if I was sitting in the day room of the retirement home, my last erection a foggy memory, filled with bitterness that one of the few things in life I really truly wanted I had never pursued. I'd fap daily, use video games to calm my anger each night as I drank until I was ready to fall asleep on the couch (never in bed with my wife - I'd transition to the bed about 2am or sometimes as late as 4am, depending on how much I'd drank). I fulfilled my responsibilities as a dad as sincerely as I could, and my responsibilities as a husband as cordially as I could.

I never got angry or upset to her about our sexlife (though I was definitely plenty angry), instead it was a passive-aggressive abandonment of the entire relationship.

One day in April or May of this year, I read a story about people coming out gay late in life after faking heterosexuality for, sometimes, decades, leaving their spouses feeling angry and duped, one child quoted along the lines of ""that bastard let my mom think she was the problem all these years, stealing from her whatever chance she had of a fulfilling sex life because he was too much of a coward to live up to who he was."" What struck me about it was the sense of how legitimate it was to want a sex life. My fapping habit (daily, have I mentioned that) had led me to /r/gonewild, and from there I found /r/deadbedrooms and I got some sense for how common my situation was and how real it could be that it would never get better. And then I was lucky enough to view top posts and found the tale of the scrub-sponge as a sex toy. http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/t5nn9/how_i_learned_to_resurrect_a_dead_bedroom_or_the/

I've always been a bit obsessive about things and now I was obsessing about whether or not I'd die filled with bitterness. I found /r/sex and googled around a bit for more advice and grew in my conviction that it was OK for me to want to have a life with some sex in it, to have that as a priority, that it wasn't shallow to care about or selfish to want to be happy, and that maybe it was possible to change things. Ultimately I decided to, praise be to /r/sex, communicate with her.

I really can't break this down chronologically or cause and effect, it was all linked together and just the final product of a fevered month of obsession.

Ultimately, I read about the scrub-sponge (link above), I read about what women want
https://www.google.com/search?q=thedirtynormal+%22what+women+want%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8

I found http://5lovelanguages.com

I thought about what she'd told me she wanted from me in our relationship - to feel connected.

I thought about what I wanted from our relationship, how to express that in a non-confrontational way, and finally found a day to bring it up that happened to be the perfect day.

She had just finished the reporting for the end of the school year, a great day for her, the weather was nice, I was home on a vacation day to help with something, no idea what in retrospect, and I just told her I wanted to talk. I honestly wish I remember more of what I said and how I said it, but the basic idea was that I said, ""I know you want to be connected emotionally, and I do to. And I know that you've told me that you don't feel a desire for a physical connection until you already feel the emotional connection. For me it works in the reverse - I don't feel a desire for the emotional connection until I've already made the physical connection. It's like a circle - if I'm making the emotional connection with you, you make the physical connection with me, and so I make the emotional connection with you, and it goes on."" I explained the 5lovelanguages frame work to her, and she told me she'd bought it and showed it to me and that we'd in fact already talked about it in the past, and it had come to nothing, but, lucky me, she had liked it! It gave legit standing to the notion that some people just need physical expressions to feel their partners love - hugs, cuddles, back rubs, and, yes, sex. I down played the sex, I think it would have set off 'he just wants some' alarms. In fact, I managed my message so carefully at one point she said if she didn't trust me she would have thought I had a script because everything I was saying was so much just the way she needed to hear it. In all honesty, I did have a script, but it was one I had composed myself, and then rehearsed endlessly.

But I got through to her, and she kept up her side of it - twice that day and once more the next day. And I took it on myself to break out everything I had learned - I cleaned the SHIT out of EVERYTHING. And honestly, it was so dang easy with the prospect of having sweet sex back in my life. I felt energized like I can't ever remember having felt before. But I never framed it to her, or even thought of it myself, as an 'exchange' or a bargin. It was me simply showing my love for her, doing the right thing for the exhausted mother of my children. And I made a point to take up chores that could only be for her. I don't drink coffee, but soon I was the only one making it so that first thing in the morning, she'd be drinking the evidence of my commitment to her. I started making the bed every morning, something I'd never done, an immature hold over from my teen years (""it's just going to get unmade again tonight!""). I wrote her a little note before leaving for work that she'd find in the morning with her coffee mentioning something from the day before or coming up that day that was about her and me and our family - about our emotional connection. I put out for her emotions the way I wanted her to put out for my sex drive. I started plucking my monobrow into two separate brows, bought new clothes, and made a point to notice when she bought new clothes too. I stopped getting so upset about things that I couldn't change about her (instead of ""jesus christ, I have to completely reload the dishwasher to get all the dishes in again tonight"" it became ""I'm glad this puzzle of efficient dishwasher loading isn't something she has to fret over during the day while she tries to make sure the kids do their homework"").

And it went on like that day after day, and I ramped it up from there. I suspected that at first we'd have a honeymoon stage when she felt the ""omg, he still wants me"" emotions, but that would die away if there wasn't more to it. I flirted, I told her how I would respect her boundaries (long ago I'd whine for sex while she was on her period - she didn't want to do it, I'd pressure her, she would eventually, and that is one of the many steps that lead to a dead bed room...) and I made sure to address any issue that could come between us. Might she, a 40 year old woman who has delivered 3 children and is quite busy raising them have some body image issues? Well, yes, she might. So, compliment her on her body. Women don't want you to ignore something, it gives them the space to assume you agree with the worst. You have to say what you think. She's laying next to you naked, and of course she is not a center fold, but you compliment her. You don't say ""nice tits"" you say ""sweetie, I have to say, your breasts are just beautiful. Classic beauty. I can't get enough of them."" And then you kiss her CHEEK, not her tits.

And so you start seducing her and you never stop. You decide that if you aren't going outside your comfort zone a bit, you aren't trying hard enough to change things. You write her erotica, but erotica that is about her - about how tired she can be, about how you (fulfilling her fantasy) wait day after day to touch her body, how much your love for her is anchored by her commitment to her children. And you get racy, but you know not to get too racy - because you know her! Everything you do says, ""you know I love you because I know you so well.""

I think of a sex life as almost like a child - it has the DNA of both partners, but it's going to have it's own character. And it's going to have to grown, and you are going to have to accept it as it is. To help it grown, I tried some dirty talk (mild stuff) I tried some of the 'what women want' from http://thedirtynormal.com, I explained that if she didn't want me to go down on her again, that was ok, that was her boundary, but that I want to please her and I like to do it, and I just remember how good she used to taste and if I could taste her again it would mean so much to me.

I took things slow. So  S  L     O      W       OMG, so slow. That's what she needed. That was respecting her boundaries. That was respecting her and showing her that sex was important to me, but NOT more important that she was. Don't send the message ""I love you because you fuck me."" Really, how insulting is that, right? Horrible.

There were bad days, the day she called when we were going to have a 'special day', crying because she was just freaking out about what I might be expecting from her. We fought a bit, but I tried so hard to not just withdraw to not let her withdraw, to be honest about what I want, to respect that my needs were legitimate, that her fear was legitimate, that I cared about her, not about sex. And then she realized she could trust me. I wanted her, so bad I wanted her, but I was in control, I was safe (thedirtynormal, what women want).

One thing I think I learned was that a large part of my high sex drive was feeling insecure in the relationship. If I felt a little panicky that maybe she wasn't happy with me (low self-esteem issues) I wanted to get her in bed to reassure myself that we were 'OK'. I told her that, she got it, and stopped doing it, but she understood a little better what sex meant to me, why it was good for her too.

And so on it went, and also, so SLOW. But now we are touching constantly, she and I are so much happier. And honestly, I don't really get off on porn now, just not very interesting, and fapping is similarly not very tempting (but every now and then habit seems to say 'do it!'). I can goes days without getting off - because it isn't about getting off, it is about getting close. I've learned so much about her, about how much security matters to her. What I used to think was a quirk or habit (locking the car doors NO MATTER WHAT) I now understood - she's just got a little anxiety. Don't criticise her for it, you love her so comfort her.

I thought I would just be happy to get off more often, but I found that what I really wanted and enjoyed was the intimacy and the trust.

Sorry for the stream of consciousness rambling, but if I tried to do it perfect it would never happen, and I feel so much solidarity with this subreddit and so much solidarity with everyone suffering through a dead bedroom - ITS SO HARD TO DEAL WITH.

I felt like I really wanted to post with some clues, some sense of where to start to try and put it back together again.

A few other notes, things to look up or google - effects of birth control and SSRI's on libido, responsive desire, fear of something (anger, body image, criticism/performance anxiety, escalating demands - from more frequent sex to more kinky sex, etc). Think of each of these things and don't just say 'not this one, not that one, must be this one'.

You're ""tired"", of course, probably asleep by now. I'm crying, but silently. Trying to hide the tears. You ask ""why are you sniffling?""

Take a wild guess. I tell you ""Just some dust"", and you roll back over, content to sleep without a care in the world. 

I drove 2 hours in the dark and fog tonight to visit you because you said you missed me. Silly me to expect sex, it's been a month...and it'll be another month I guess. I can almost grasp the cold and distance that I feel between our bodies, even when our backs are touching while we curl up in bed. I want to scream. But, you're tired. What good will come from another talk? I'll tell you I feel disgusting and you'll call me beautiful. I'll cry that I feel unwanted and unworthy, and you'll say everything I want to hear. Well, that's not enough for me. Just kiss me. Kiss me and tell me that you want me so bad, but it'll have to wait to the morning or this afternoon because you've had a long day. I'd be totally content with that. 
But this...this partnership is more like an awkward friendship. One sided, really. I'm the friend who always wants to hang out and you're the friend who never shows up on time. You won't even let yourself get in the mood. No, no, no.  ""I'm too tired, dammit!"" Aren't we all. I'm tired of waiting all night for you. I'm tired of the sinking feeling of another night and another opportunity washed down the drain. I'm tired of the pointless prepping too. I always shower with my special bath gel and even shave in anticipation that you'll even touch my legs or my hips. But you won't. A lot of wasted Gillette shave gel, and a wasted day at that. 

The funny thing is you seem to know what I want. You ask me with a shaky voice ""is everything alright?""  You damn well know it's not. This is the only alone time and opportunity for intimacy for the next month and you are keen on brushing right past it. You know that I want you. You know I think you're the sexiest man I've ever seen. Writing that makes my heart beat a little differently. You're so beautiful to me. Alluring, intoxicating. I want you so bad. Even just for a knowing glance. A loving smile. Something. I see it in you, I know I do. That's what makes this difficult. 

You just told me you loved me. You said you were so grateful I drove 100 miles at 10 pm just to be with you. You run my back...stop it. Stop touching me. You ask me why I don't want to cuddle. I smile and just say I'm too warm. But it's because I can't stand your touch. Everything is a tease to me. I want the touches and grazes and pinches. But I also want the grabbing and holding and rubbing. I want it all. I want you.  But I can't have you...I only get 50%. This isn't clothes shopping, you're not a used car. I either want all of you or none at all. 

And for now, I'll have to live with none at all.

This is my final post, Thanks for all the support everyone!",113,19,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1h1m0c/just_had_the_most_intense_sex_of_my_life_this_is/,"I really don't mean to brag, but I thought I should share one final story.  I had the most incredible encounter and I never would have believed it was possible.  After all the years of staleness and rejection, I had so internalized the idea that women didn't like sex and that I was an undesirable partner.  This was the most eye opening experience of my life.

I went out of town to hang out with some friends and get my mind off the pending divorce which I was still a little uneasy about.  I spent the day with a small group including someone I had met once before who was going through a divorce herself.  We hit it off pretty well and spent most of the day a little separate from the rest of the group sharing our stories, pain, advice, etc.  We got a little tipsy, started really flirting, and then she grabbed me and started kissing me with such intensity right there in public.  She nervously asked if I would stay with her that night which I agreed to.

I won't get into too many details, because I know they were hard for me to read on this sub.  But we were basically up the entire night talking and holding each other and having sex over and over and over again.  She was so passionate, screaming and yelling and begging for more, moaning and calling out my name.  I've only once had a woman who was that into me, and I've never had sex that intense.  After years of DB, I would have thought it was impossible for a woman to be more into me than I was into her, but she clearly was and it felt incredible.

When I left her place the next morning, I felt like I had transformed into myself from 7 or 8 years ago.  I was sexy, I was confident, women wanted me, they REALLY wanted me.  My heart is racing right now just recalling it all and I've been experiencing feelings that I had almost forgotten I'd ever had.

Before this experience, I was still a little unsure I was doing the right thing with the divorce, but knowing what I do now, I could never go back.  There is so much life out there to experience, so many feelings and emotions and intensities.  I've never been so excited for what's to come.  I also have been able to forgive my wife.  The anger and resentment just vanished.  I've moved on. I don't need her physically, and I no longer desire her for the half-hearted sex we rarely had.  I think we'll be able to be civil throughout the whole process and probably even stay friends.  Lifting the pressure of a DB changes everything.

I want to wish a sincere Thank You to everyone in this community.  Whether I was asking for advice, giving some, or just lurking, this place was incredibly supportive.  You guys (and gals) helped me get through some tough times, as well as kick my ass into gear about doing something to fix my life.

Thank you everyone!

She told me, no, probably not.  I said, as calmly as I could, that I wasn't going to live without sex, so I couldn't have sex with her, we were going to have to divorce.  She said what she always says when she'd mad, what I think every woman always says when she'd mad: ""Fine.""

I wasn't happy about this development, but I just went and watched TV.  I was watching *Parks &amp; Rec* on Netflix, when she came into the room. ""So you're so happy we're getting divorced, you're laughing.""

""I was watching *Parks &amp; Rec*.  It's a funny show. I'm not the one who wants to get divorced.  I just want to have sex with my wife.""  It went back and forth like that, but I stuck to my position.   I didn't want to get divorced, but I refused to live a sexless life.  Very subdued, she went upstairs.

About a half-hour later, she called down from the bedroom, said she had something to show me.  I went upstairs, she's standing somewhat uncertainly by the bed, wearing a tank-top and nothing else.

The next day, she had an idea.  She wants me to lose weight.  I'm not some huge tub of lard, but I could definitely drop a bit (she, by contrast, has put on all of three pounds through 20 years of marriage and two pregnancies).  She offered a deal, one sexual encounter for five pounds lost.  To seal the deal, she weighed me, and we went to bed.  For the first time ever, *ever*, she had me come in her mouth.

A week later, I was late for work, but she weighed me again: four pounds down, maybe, but she decided that was close enough and insisted we have sex.

10 days later, she wanted it again.  She remembered about the deal at the last second.  ""This'll have to be a freebie,"" I told her as I penetrated her.  She just laughed.

So it's not exactly a stud-farm around the Quinn residence, but things are looking up.  And I'm eating a lot of salads.

1375888239.0,88,self.DeadBedrooms,1jvxzh,I'm going to tell you a story...,102,14,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1jvxzh/im_going_to_tell_you_a_story/,"In the beginning of the relationship, everything was bliss.  Lots of sex, lots of  passion, no problems, no worries.  You loved each other very much.  Things were always intimate, new and exciting.  How could this get any better?  ""I've found the one!"" you say to yourself, and you commit to a exclusive long term relationship.  For some of us, that means marriage.


Then life happens.  Jobs, kids, stress, family...it doesn't really matter what it was, but things changed.  Attitudes, feelings, ideas, priorities on both parts, yours and theirs. Intimacy remains important, but as you find out, only to you.


Suddenly what was once the simplest, best thing in the world, is now the most complicated and difficult thing to endure asking about.  The frequency drops from a few times a week, to a few times a month, to a few times every other month, to a few times every six months, to a few times a year.  The few times your needs are met, it's with great unpleasantness.  There's no passion, no love, no closeness.  It feels empty, and that they're just wishing for it to be over as soon as possible.  Now you feel worse and guilty instead of better.
Then the questions begin...


I thought we were on the same page?


Don't you like me anymore?


Am I ugly now?  Am I not attractive?


Is there someone else? Am I bad in bed?


You need to feel close to have sex? You didn't before.


I ask for it too much?  I don't ask for it enough?


No matter what it is, it's never their fault.  And you never help the situation.  Their body language becomes an open, tell-all book about how you're not going to get any tonight. So much so, that you don't even need to ask any more.


And then the excuses...


You have a headache again?


Another bad day at work?


Kids tired you out again?


Still depressed?


Still bothered by that thing?


Family bothering you again?


You believe their excuses, and do your best to understand and endure.  You don't want to leave this relationship, but happiness seems like a long lost dream.  You remember it, but don't remember how it feels.  You plan romantic dinners, dates, vacations, surprises, but nothing every happens.  Hours and sometimes weeks of planning and effort go down the drain in another failed attempt at trying to recapture what was once there. And again you feel absolutely crushed and devastated by the rejection.


Self doubt creeps in...


Maybe they're right.


Maybe it is me?


Maybe I have the problem, not them.


Maybe I'm some sort of sex maniac and I need help.


Maybe I'm not normal.


Then the ultimatum.  ""We need help or else!""  But they blame you and the entire world for not understanding their point of view.  Guilt trips run rampant as they cry foul and play the blame game to a tee.  ""I know things are bad now, but they'll get better soon I promise!""  Sweet words and empty promises fill your ears and heart as you so desperately want to believe that things will get better, but they don't and never do. Sometimes they even give hints that ""Tonight's the night!"", only to have something happen turning hope into depression again.
""How much longer can I go on like this?"" You ask as you question your own endurance.  Passionless kisses, and cold hugs are the best you get for physical contact.  It feels like your starving.  Once in a great while you get a warm embrace from a co-worker or relative that feels so wonderful, you wish it would last forever.


As empty as you are, the relationship isn't terrible.  There's no abuse, no fighting, no animosity of any kind.  Except your always sad and lonely, but do your best to never show it.  Thoughts of leaving happen on a regular basis, but you know there's absolutely no guarantee that things will be better anywhere else. You're not a cheater. You love your SO.  You just wish you could flip a switch, and have their libido match yours.  Masturbation becomes a band-aid solution to make it through the day/week/moth/year.  But it's never fulfilling, and usually make you feel lonelier by the time you drift back to reality. 


It's difficult to tell what day it is because they all run together now, and you wish you didn't have a libido at all.  Life would be so much easier if you didn't need, or think about it.  Every morning you wake up, look over at your SO, and the depression, resentment, anger, sadness and loneliness start all over again.  But you don't say a word, just get up and do your best to make it through one. more. day.

That time of the month when all the stars seem to magically align and you actually have a sex drive again. It only lasts about 8 hours so sometimes I do miss it and have to wait another month or two.

So your in the mood but rather than tell me like a normal human being you signal it instead in some really subtle way. Like laying face down and reading or taking slightly too long to get dressed once out of the shower.

So I initiate hoping that I don't have the signs wrong and you aren't going to scream at me how you aren't in the mood, or you are feeling bloated or one of the million such excuses I have heard over the past 6 years.

So its foreplay time, which really means just its me focusing on you and making sure that you are wet and loose enough for us to have sex, and its quite a struggle sometimes given how long its been since the last time. So I'm going down on you or fingering you getting you wet all the while making sure that I don't do too good a job because we both know that if you cum then its all over.

Because apparently you tighten up so much after you orgasm that we can't possibly have sex. And if you do come then one of two things will happen. Either you will roll off and go to sleep or you will break out the coconut oil and give me a handjob with the most bored look possible on your face all the while talking about how great it is that you are doing this for me and making sure that ""I get mine"", and if I don't cum in less than two minutes you will start complaining that your hand hurts and that I am taking too long (which lets be honest doesn't really help the mood). So about 8 times out of 10 I end up just finishing myself off because you get bored and stop.

Or maybe I don't go overboard on the foreplay and we actually get to have sex. Whoop de doo. 10-12 minutes of fun, but only in the positions that you like, at a speed that you like oh and making sure that it doesnt actually feel too good for you because I know that if your orgasm first then its all over and you will kick me off of you and the most I will get is being allowed to wank over you whilst you lay there looking bored.

But you know what, this month I'm not going to play ball. I've had enough and I cannot be bothered to play your little games anymore. We have had 'the talk' so many times and things never change. I'm counting down the days till our lease on this place ends and maybe I'll find someone I'm compatible with - its 183 by the way. Not that I'm looking forward to it...

So, to begin, let me thank each of you whose contributed to this sub, if any of you ever need someone to listen, my virtual door will remain open :)

With that said, it's been a hell of a ride for me. After a DB of a year and seven months between me and the gal, I tried my best to get our relationship and our sexlife going again. But, ultimately, nothing I did had any real effects. All that my careful orchestrated dates and dinners and club events and other actitivies resulted in were happy responses, but if sex entered the picture I was promptly and courteously shut down. 

""not today honey, tomorrow, I promise."" I will **never ever** again believe these words because I've bitterly been taught that there is no tomorrow for me, only today.

The only real result I ever got was when I ""ambushed"" her while she was in her bed with me and that resulted in a quickie where I got her off, but she of course didn't reciproicate and used the standard excuse above.

It wasn't until last week when it dawned on me FINALLY that it was never going to happen and that I was living in a tomorrow that never happened. There was never any tomorrow where sex would happen because I was too busy ignoring the present. So I decided to end it, she knows why and she didn't have much to say on the subject, so she's seen this coming a mile away.

I could be angry and bitter with her for putting me through this ordeal, for stringing me along and keeping me hostage for almost two years with promises that she never intended to keep. But really, I'm not angry with her, I'm angry with myself. I kept myself tethered to this promise and I foolishly belived that I could fix everything on my own, how fucking arrogant and naive of me to think that.

I was a typical Twilight-hater until a couple of weeks ago. I thought everything about the franchise was ridiculous - although of course I'd never seen any of the films or read any of the books. Also, my marriage - of almost 20 years - was on its last legs. We were childhood sweethearts but somehow the years and the pressures of raising a family, and the arguments and the mistakes had all mounted up and I became the kind of guy who posts in this sub looking for sympathy.

So... a few weeks ago, a friend of my wife's was raving about Breaking Dawn Part 2 and lent her the DVDs of the first three films. Reluctantly I agreed to watch them with her.

I've got to be honest here - I actually quite enjoyed the first film, and felt terrible for doing so... but straight afterwards, we made love for the first time in a very long time, and we began to recapture something of our love. I know that must sound a bit sickly and ridiculous but when things have been as bad as they have been for us, it was amazing.

Next night... New Moon... same again. Eclipse... ticked all the boxes too. I have to work away from home a lot - something I'd partially enjoyed before - and it was a new experience for us both to miss each other again - and the night I got back, of course we watched Breaking Dawn part 1... before celebrating again.

Yesterday we went to the cinema - I was meant to be working from home, but, well, what would you do?! - and I'm not ashamed to admit I cried a fair bit - and afterwards, we had an hour before we had to collect the younger kids from school - so for the first time in years, we went home, and ran up the stairs...

She might not sparkle in the sunlight, and I certainly can't read her mind... but for now, we have rekindled something we thought was dead forever. I'm at work today, miles away... but my heart is with her now, and that's worth changing your mind about what ridiculous looks like.

But as we all know, actions speak louder than words, and over a year of little to no intimacy has caused me to fall out of love with him. 

It turns out he is disgusted by his body and his weight. I never was, but I understand that body image issues aren't always rational. Even though I am not skinny myself, when I got to that point, I did something about it/am doing something about it. He, however, has yet to really to do that, and I can't do it for him.

More down than up. Saturday night, my wife and I were watching TV in the living room, kids were asleep. We had an eventful day and my wife mentioned she was going to bed. Now, that isn't code for ""come to bed and have sex with me"". When you're married to someone for quite a while, you learn a lot. When she says she's going to bed, she's going to bed. If she asks if I'm coming to bed, then there's a 50/50 chance that she might want some.

So, off to bed she went. I finished up the show on TV and went to bed probably 20 minutes after she did. She was still awake, on her iPad. I got into bed and we both fall asleep. 

The next morning, she gets out of bed and she has no panties on. Just a shirt, no shorts and no panties. Now this is VERY unusual for my wife who is bundled up, even during the summer. I just thought she was hot last night and didn't think too much into it. Later on after breakfast she said:

Wife: I wanted some last night

Me: Umm, you did?

Wife: Yeah, I didn't wear any panties last night, just for you.

Me: Umm, and why didn't you tell me this?

Wife: Well, usually if your hand brushes up on my behind or something you would notice.

Me:*ok*.......

Wife: I also shaved last night(private area) for you too.

Me: *sign*..again, when did you tell me this?

Wife: Well, if we had sex last night, you would have noticed.

Me: Ok, just next time, maybe grab my hand and show me your not wearing any panties, or how about you just tell me your not wearing any panties and that you want to have sex with me.

Wife: That's no fun.

Talked to my wife about it; she basically says this is the way it is, and I can get a divorce if I don't like it.",79,6,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/o6i5b/married_16_yrs_currently_on_6yr_dry_spell_talked/,"My wife and I got married at 25 after dating about 5 years.  When we first started going out, we agreed to only go as far as oral, and man, I had no complaints.  We got together at least once a week and fooled around at her house late at night after her family went to sleep.  Frequency tapered off a bit over time, but still, that's expected and I was just thrilled to be with her.  She loved me at the time (I guess?), and she would cuddle with me, hold my hand and all that stuff.  Looking back, this was the only time in my life that I knew what it was like to be deeply in love, and to feel loved as a person.

So eventually we got married.  The first time my wife and I had full-blown intercourse was weird and awkward, which maybe was a bad sign.  (Our hotel suite was on the same floor as a raucous party, and drunken guests kept running up and down the hall, banging on doors and even jimmying door handles.)  From there on in, our relationship went into a definite tailspin, both in- and outside the bedroom.  But *especially* in the bedroom.  Once a month became once every other month, to 4-5 times a year... and then, nothing.  When my wife started to talk about having a child about 8 yrs ago, I was deliriously happy, because I always wanted to be a dad, and at least while we were trying to conceive I'd be getting laid regularly.  So there was a major uptick in our sex life for about a year, I think, until she finally got pregnant.  (The sex during this time was rather mechanical and rote.)  We now have a beautiful son.

Ever since then, it's been back to nothing -- no sex, and worse, no affection whatsoever.  No hugs, no pecks on the cheek, no smiles, no kind words.  I mean, absolutely nothing, aside from the perfunctory ""Love,"" on a Hallmark card twice a year (Christmas and birthday), which under the circumstances is perfectly meaningless.  I would go to kiss her goodbye every morning, and she'd have this blank expression on her face and would barely pucker her lips.  I eventually stopped trying.  Depression settled over me big-time, and it would only get worse.  

A few months ago, I asked my wife if we could talk about this and try to fix whatever's wrong, and she flat-out refused.  I asked her if she loved me.  Her reply, after a long pause, was ""You're a good father to [our son].""  Her position is that this is just how things are; and if I don't like it, well, there's always divorce.  My wife of 16 years said this to me matter-of-factly.  Now, divorce would be an option, if not for my son, whom I love more than life itself.  The thought of not being able to see my boy and hug him every day is something I cannot even begin to fathom.  More importantly, I worry about what our divorce would do to him emotionally.  (He's 5.)

So, yes, our bedroom is dead, and our marriage is dead.  There are days I feel like I would die of a broken heart if not for our son.  

I turn 42 yrs old this year.  There's no hope I'll ever know romantic love ever again.  This is the reality I see in the mirror every day.

In the last year of our relationship we had sex maybe five times, and almost every time ended in frustration, anger, and sometimes tears.  He had problems getting aroused, problems ejaculating, etc.  I tried to be supportive, encouraging, patient, you name it.  I tried EVERYTHING--letting him come to me, being the initiator, dressing up, losing weight, etc etc etc.  He blamed me for all of our problems in the bedroom and did very little to attempt to revive our sex life.  It was heartbreaking--many nights I fell asleep turned away from him, desperately needing sexual release and thinking to myself that this was just how it was going to have to be for the rest of my life.

He ended the relationship nine months ago--I was devastated, but we were both really unhappy and it was honestly the best thing for us.  I actually wish we had broken up a lot sooner.  By the end of the relationship, I was convinced that I was completely unattractive and unsexy.  Imagine my surprise when I started dating again and realized that, oh, men ARE attracted to me!

The first time I had sex with my current boyfriend, I came four times and practically cried afterwards because I felt so relieved and happy.  It wasn't just the physical release--I don't think I had realized how lonely I had been for that kind of human connection.  We've been together for five months now, and we have sex at least six times a week--often twice a day on weekends.  It is fun every time--I feel close and connected to him, and I feel good about myself for the first time in years.  Sex is a part of our routine as a couple, not sometime either of us has to barter or beg for.

If you are like me, you might be staying with your partner because you are the type who becomes fiercely committed once you are in a relationship.  If your situation sounds like the one I was in with my ex, PLEASE consider leaving.  If you are both unhappy, if your self esteem is suffering, if your partner has basically given up trying to resolve the problem, you will have to resign yourself to a life filled with disappointment and dissatisfaction.  You don't have to!  Everyone deserves a partner who makes them feel cherished, attractive, and desirable.  I am a million times happier now than I was nine months ago.  The break up was the hardest thing I've ever been through, and it took me months to recover, but god DAMN was it worth it in the end.

I used to lurk this subreddit all the time, looking for ideas and enjoying the commiseration within this community.  When people would post about ending their relationship as a ""solution"" to a dead bedroom, I would feel annoyed because I honestly felt that wasn't an option in my case.  Well, it WAS an option for me, and it may be an option for you.  I just wanted to share my story in case it might be the motivation someone needs to make a positive change.

TL;DR:  Spent three years in a near-sexless relationship.  He broke up with me, and now I have a healthy, fulfilling sex life with a partner who makes me feel beautiful and desirable.

You can tell that something is bothering me. You ask what it is but I have to smile and lie and say I'm fine. There's no point in telling you what's getting me down. We've had this talk a thousand times before and it goes nowhere.

You make promises. Tell me things I want to hear. We have good sex, maybe even a few days in a row and things start to look up. And then we go dry for another few weeks or months. How long will this spell last?

You ask if I really am that busy with work, with suspicion in your voice. Half your fears are right. But if I knew if I could come home early and find you wanting me physically I'd say to hell with my work and everything else and rush home. This isn't new, I've told you this before in clear, direct language. Somehow you don't understand. Even if I do get home early the best I can hope for are maybes and excuses.

I've told you I don't care if I come home and there's no dinner and the chores aren't done and I don't have any clean clothes to wear - if you were interested in me sexually or just wanted to give me a blowjob to improve my day I'd be the happiest man on Earth. I've told you this directly several times and somehow you just don't get it.

For my birthday I told you I didn't need that expensive wallet you were looking at in the store. All I wanted was a healthy sex life. If I could be granted one wish. I didn't need material items. Yet on my birthday I unwrapped that wallet, and we went for another few months without sex.

I'm sure you'd be willing to take one for the team and put out a few times a week. You've done it before. But that's not what I want at all. I want a partner who wants sex and enjoys it just as much as I do if not more. Is that asking for too much? I don't bother initiating because nothing you do or say gives off even the slightest impression you want sex, and I don't want you to just lay there and take it and think you're doing me a favor.

I'm sorry I'm not honoring the unspoken agreement I made with you. The one you'll never know about. I try not to expect sex from you. I really do. But this isn't the life I wanted. I told you this before marriage ever was on the table and you promised you were on the same page. And yet here we are. People tell me to do the ""honorable"" thing and just leave you. I can't do that. I can't just leave you and our family behind. Then I'd be a monster. So I have to keep living the lifestyle I do, keep being a different kind of monster. One you'd never forgive if you knew. But it keeps me from crying myself to sleep at night. Why aren't there any better options?

I know you love me. You show me in your own ways. The ways you think people are supposed to show their love. I've told you that's all well and good, but just give me intimacy and that's all I really need. I've said this over and over and over again but you never understand. If you haven't figured out by now I suppose it's futile to hope you ever will. 

This is the Valentine message I wish I could write to you. I wish I could, but I can't. Instead I'll write the standard message of love and affection. It's what you're expecting. And I'll smile and try to be happy. It's what you want. And you'll keep doing what you think I want, even though the one thing I really do want continues to be nothing more than a dream.

",88,16,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/153ass/i_appear_to_be_on_my_way_out_of_a_deadbedroom_was/,"So my story was worse than most I have read here.  I went 5 years without sex with my wife.  What worked for me:

I caught my wife getting a message on facebook from a guy she worked with.  I dont think she meant to cheat, jsut flirting, but this was after 5 years of sleeping in seperate rooms.  I cant say if a woman was very flirty with me, that I wouldnthave flirted back myself.  She gave no other signs of cheating though.  I told her i was not happy and would not deal with her acting like this.  She kind of flipped out and said she was scared of losing me, that she wanted to make it work.  She said she was also not happy.  I told her we needed to get our relationship back, get sleeping together, etc.  We had started co -sleeping with our kids, and it ended up that I just slept on a matress in my son's room for years.  it wasnt easy to get the kids sleeping on their own, but we did it, although we let them sleep with us 2 nights a week still.  The idea was to balance our time with the kids, but not give up our own relationship.  

It wasn't easy, and it had its ups and downs.  I read a book called The Married Man Sex Life, which apparently is pretty controversial.  Some of his advice is good.  Take care of yourself, dress well, etc.  Make sure you have the house in order.  I havent fixed everything in the house, but I jumped on one project and brought up ideas with my wife on how to fix other things, get more organized, etc.  The book said that talking to your wife wont fix anything though... and he is wrong.  Talking helped, but it wasn't simple.  

The real thing i realized is that even soemthing simple can be looked at differently by your partner.  I would try to flirt with my wife and be spontaneous, like grabbing her for a kiss... and she wouldnt respond well.  To me it seemed that she just didn't want me, but after talking a lot, it seems that she just felt it was me pressuring her for sex.  Over the last 6 months, I just tried REALLY hard to listen to what she had to say, and talk about how I felt, and not try so much to just show her how I was right.  I would just explain to her that it seemed there was no way out of this problem.  how could I show her I was sexually interested in her, if she felt any time I made a pass at her that she would feel pressured to have sex.  I wonder if the problem was just that she felt obligated to have sex.  She has said that she had this problem with any relationship over time.  She would feel she had to have sex to keep a guy, and then lose interest.  I told her I knew how she felt.  The end of our sex life initially was when she got pregnant for our daughter.  By the time she got pregnant, I remember feeling that I was just happy it wasover, as I felt I HAD to have sex when was ready, and in just two months of trying, I went from enjoying the sex, to dreading it.  Same woman, same sex life, two months, and I couldnt wait for it to be over.  Strange huh?

so it seems the problem was that she felt she was required to have it, and didnt have much choice in the matter, if she wanted to keep a guy.  

Once i got this idea, I started to point out how this was wrong about our life together.  Our sex life had been fairly low before we even got married, but I had still married her.  I had wanted more wild and crazy sex, but she didnt, and I had still married her.  I explained at one point that it wasnt that I just wanted sex, I wanted BOTH halves to the relationship:  the Friend half of her, and the Lover half.  If I had only wanted the Lover half, I wouldnt have married someone who only had sex with me once a month.  This seemed to help, to help her realize that I wasnt just looking for sex.  Just the other night, while talking, I got talking about sex and then apologized, as I didnt want us to talk about it too much, or be pushy... and she said that she also needed to relax about it, that it was ok for me to want sex, and that she should be happy that I still wanted sex with her so much.  I had been talking about an idea I had to just take a month and not have sex at all, to just spend a couple nights a week cuddling and talking.  In the past few months, she felt if i wanted to cuddle or make out, that i was just trying to get her in the mood for sex, that it was all for sex.  I did want to help her get in the mood, but it was for Us, not just for me to get sex from her.  She perceived it that i just wanted something from her though.  So I said that my other idea was to go the other way... to try having sex a couple times a week.  In the past, actually when we were trying to get pregnant with our daughter, she had once said after sex that ""this is good, I feel so close to you, that we are connected'.  I pointed this out to her, that us having sex was good for us, that it would help us not bicker, and that in turn would make sex easier and more desirable.  We would likely be less touchy with the kids, which would make us have less stressful days... which again, leads to making it much easier ot have sex.  I have some medical issues that make it uncomfortable to have sex sometimes, and I was having this problem at this time.  So I said 'well i tell you what, if you want, ill take this entire month, as i probably wont be ready for sex until next month anyway, to just fool around every couple days, and ill give you an orgasm every time.  This will show that im not here just to get off.  I want intimacy, and i want YOU, to be close to you and to love you.  I dont care if I have an orgasm.'  Then I was going to say we could also do the other idea of not having sex for the month and before I could finish she said ""well its already thursday so its a day later than we would normally have sex, can we start tonight anyway?""   And since then, things are going really well.  I said we should try to fool around every couple days, but that she didnt have to feel obligated to have it either.  We need to make an effort to have sex, but you also don't want to feel obligated.  I really think this feeling of obligation, of having no choice in the matter, is what caused her to lose interest in sex.

Anyway, not that I am any expert, if I had to list bullet points on what i would suggest to men in my positiion, having apparently succeeded in getting out of my dead bedroom, it would be this:

* you have to let them know you arent happy, and that things cant continue as they are.  This is pretty scary, and i dont think you can fake this.  YOu have to be ready to leave.  i was.  i also made sure to tell her many times that I would not leave due to lack of SEX, it was due to lack of INTIMACY.  If she could be close to me, hugs, kisses, affection, but for some reason we could not ever have sex again, ever, i would stay.  If she would not give me intimacy... I could not live that way and be happy.  I think this more than anything was what helped, to get her to realize it wasn't just getting an orgasm that i wanted, I wanted HER.
* Talk talk talk, and be open to the idea that you have helped create the problem too.  i realized that I pulled back from sex after she got pregnant for our daughter, because i couldnt understand why I didnt want to have sex with her, and instead of dealing with that, i just withdrew from her, and it snowballed out of control.  
* Be ready to do whatever you can to correct whatever issue is causing the problem.  I might have gotten lucky to find out that my wife's big problem, apparently, was that she felt forced to have sex.  Talking is the only way to have any hope of finding out what the problem is.  At times my wife would say that we had talked things over and over, but I would not give up.  I wouldnt push things every night, but I kept pushing over time.

The true instances invole SSRIs, mental trauma and health issues.  The painful reality is that most of the time low libido is claimed it is really that our partners don't find us sexually attractive anymore. Almost everyone I know that has been ""low libido"" has gone on a sex spree after they have gotten divorced. Where did that low libido go? When my wife's friends get drunk and start talking about sex they always mention that they wished they had of been wilder sexually when they were single.  These are the same women that won't put out for their husbands. Why not be wild with your husband or is it that you low libido ends where the thought of a new partner begins?

 I don't believe for one second the vast majority of our ""low libido"" partners wouldn't instantly have sex with a person that was new or they fantisized about. You think my wife would have a headache or low libido if Brad Pitt wanted to slam her up against the wall? I think her low libido would vanish..no I know it would vanish. I have a funny feeling Brad would be the aspirin to make her ""low libido"" headache to go away....

And that's the hardest part about ""low libido""....It's personal...very personal. It's a personal rejection of someone that they supposedly care about. It's rejecting the person that loves you when they would welcome someone else that is ""new"" and or ""exciting"". I refuse to stick my head in the sand because of my ego. It's the cold hard truth and I would rather face it than to lie and provide a hundred excuse as to why she has a ""low libido"" outside of the fact that she doesn't find me attractive....and you know what it's made me find her unattractive which makes the ""low libido"" lie so much easier to deal with.

I am very strongly effected by my emotional state. My libido waxes and wanes. When it wanes, I give my husband hand jobs and blow jobs. I like to see him happy, it cuts down on any tension or frustration, and I don't have to feel guilty about not having sex. 

Does nobody else really try this? I am trying to be helpful here and barring any major emotional/infidelity issues in the relationship, this is really SO easy to do.

To be sure, there's a fine line between commiserating and invalidating. But keep in mind that these responses can affect the OP, and others who are reading that may be in a similar situation, but have not yet found the strength to post about it:

* Sending the message that they *should* be satisfied (and something is wrong with them if they aren't)
* Telling them sex isn't important enough to have *that* much, only as much as you think you need it
* Invaliding their pain and/or the circumstances of their situation

1369495657.0,70,self.DeadBedrooms,1f16bx,I (25F ML) and my husband (31M LL) have only had sex once. You read that right. Once.,85,15,329,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1f16bx/i_25f_ml_and_my_husband_31m_ll_have_only_had_sex/,"The back-story:
We met in university 5 years ago, through some friends.  We have a lot in common and we were both at similar points in our lives (I was starting my second degree and he was starting his Master's).  We started off as friends, but it eventually became more than that and we started dating.  Being together was, and still is, amazing.

We kissed and touched to some degree, but not the degree I would have liked.  We were both virgins, but I had dated previously and fooled around.  I mean, I didn't have penis-in-vagina sex but I had certainly had plenty of oral.  He hadn't dated before, however.  This should have been a bigger red flag, but I chalked it up to him being quiet and nerdy.  At the time, he certainly kissed me like he meant it.

The thing is, he wanted to wait before marriage, due to religious reasons.  I wasn't interested in waiting, personally, but I was willing to respect his beliefs.  The rest of the relationship was perfect and he genuinely seemed like he wanted me.  We decided we wanted to get married, and before getting engaged we decided to do a pre-marital course in order to outline our expectations.  This included sexual expectations and we talked about this openly and extensively.  Honestly, our expectations before marriage were very similar.

So, we got engaged, bought a house (somehow living together before marriage was not forbidden), and got married.  We fooled around for the first couple of weeks and I tried to initiate sex, but he avoided it.  Eventually, we tried having sex and he was so nervous he couldn't keep it up.  Whatever.  This shit happens.  Keep trying, though, right?  No.  He was so scared of disappointing me that he didn't want to try.  I tried making things low pressure, so he wasn't so nervous, but it just didn't work.

Fuck, right?  He just sort of shut off and was so scared of failing he didn't want to try.  We tried various things (sensation enhancing creams, cock rings, etc) and nothing made a difference.  I asked him to consider getting cialis or viagra or something, and this was like admitting he was a failure.  For all I knew, he had erectile dysfunction.  Again, whatever, this shit happens.  And if he had E.D., I'd try to make the best of it.  But something didn't seem right...  So I asked him about masturbation.

Yep.  He couldn't get it up in my presence but had no issue rubbing one out every day to kinky online stories.  I asked him about his fetishes, to see if any of them were something I could incorporate into the bedroom, but no go.  I am pretty open minded when it comes to sex and roleplaying, but this was pretty fucked up.  Anyway.  I felt like the masturbation was getting in the way of our theoretical sex life.  Like, apparently after fooling around, he would masturbate after I'd gone to bed, even though I was begging to have sex moments previous.  What the fuck.  We talked about this and he agreed to try to stop masturbating and to try to let me know we he was horny.  Cool.  Some progress.

However, he still didn't want to have sex.  So this quickly turned into the occasional hand-job with the lights turned off and no one talking.  Also, at this point, I learned that if he wasn't going to masturbate he didn't want me to masturbate because he was jealous.  However, he wasn't offering to get me off.  I asked him to pleasure me on many occasions but he treated it like it was too much work, or that vaginas are too gross (for reference, I wash my vagina everyday with gynecological soap and keep my pubic hair trim and neat.  My vagina is so clean you could eat out of it, hahaha).  To this day I have gotten about 3 minutes of oral sex out of him.

Eventually, he agreed to try cialis, but that only works if you try.  He still wasn't willing to initiate or respond positively when I tried to initiate.  So, the cialis is largely unused in a cupboard.

I demanded we see a relationship counsellor.  He accused me of not trusting that he was trying to fix the situation.  To his horror, I agreed.  He was right, I damn well didn't trust that he was trying to fix the situation.  At this point, we were probably 4 months into the marriage and both still virgins.  He agreed to see a counsellor and we set up a meeting.  I think we got the shittiest marriage counsellor in existence.  First, she essentially told me ""Your relationship is otherwise great, right?  Then why are you complaining?  I have people that are being beaten by their spouses.  I think you need to get over yourself.""

I was fucking pissed.  Yeah, not having intimacy is not as bad as other alternatives, but shit.  My husband seemed pretty content with this answer, though.  He seemed happy with our relationship.  I demanded to see the counsellor again, because he didn't want to see a different one.  He figured I was just trying to get a second opinion until someone sided with me.  No.  I just thought she was a quack.  Well, we saw her again, and I went more into detail about our issues.  After finally listening, she concluded that our relationship is pretty fucked up and that my husband (and possibly I) should see a sex therapist.

I asked him to book an appointment to see a sex therapist.  I'm sure I could have booked it myself.  But I asked him to do it because I wanted to see if he was willing to actually put in the effort to do it.  Also, because he could book it through his work benefits, and only he had the login for it.  I told him that it was really important to me that he book it.  This was about 4-5 months into our marriage.

Fast forward a few sexless months later.  His aunt and uncle book us a couple nights in a hotel with room service wine/fruit as an early anniversary gift.  He feels obligated to have sex since that's what was implied by the gift.  We end up having some wine and finally doing the deed.  This was the one and only time we have had sex.  This was 9 months into the marriage.

Fast forward to 1 year 3 months into our marriage.  He has not booked an appointment with the sex therapist, despite that being almost a year previous.  I stop sleeping in the same bed as him and am now emotionally broken.  I give him an ultimatum: see a sex therapist, or I'm leaving you.  And if you see a sex therapist, I still may end up leaving you.  At this point, I feel the damage is done.  He is my best friend, but that's it.  He knew that booking the appointment was really important to me, but he put it off for almost a year.  One soul crushing year.

He cries.  But then he books the appointment.  He sees the sex therapist alone and comes back upset.  The therapist told him that he has serious problems and should join sexaholics anonymous for pornography addiction.  I support him in this, buy him a bunch of books to help him, and he starts attending meetings.  I start seeing my own therapist, trying to deal with the damage that has been done.  He stops seeing the sex therapist.  I'm not sure when.  At this point, we are now about 1 year and 4 months into our marriage.  I want to die.  He thinks we will be together forever.

Fast forward a few more months.  I forget exactly what happend, but I talk to my therapist about divorce.  About how scared I am.  About how I don't feel like I can talk to any of my friends or family about these concerns.  The therapist and I talk about the options, especially divorce.  I love my husband, but I feel trapped.  I have told my husband how I felt all along this journey.  I'm not the type of person who expects their significant other to read minds.  But somehow he still doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.

I tell my husband that I am trying to find a family/divorce lawyer in order to find out what my rights are.  He weeps.  I weep.  Horrifyingly, I am more upset that I will likely have to give up my house.  I work as a contractor, as opposed to a permanent employee and do not have the financial stability (in the eyes of the bank) to qualify for a mortgage.  But I have put so much work into the house and garden.  Its my home.

He tells me that he will do whatever he can in order to let me keep the house, in the event of a divorce.  I weep.  I finally feel like he understands how serious I am.  We finally have an open conversation about our relationship.  One where he isn't assuming that we're going to be together forever.  We talk about his concerns and fears.  Why things are the way they are.  He says he will do anything in his power to fix things.  I feel like he is finally trying, and despite my better sense, agree to to give him another chance.  That was 1-2 months ago.

Things are better, but still not great.  He is trying his best to make me feel sexy and wanted.  We both have started a diet and exercise regiment in order to look and feel better (good ole endorphins).  He is finally reading some of the porn addiction books I got him.  And I managed to even get a orgasmic finger banging out of him yesterday.  He seems to be trying.  The sad thing is, I still don't know if its too little too late.

I don't know what to do.

For 10 years. He seriously, seriously likes being dominated. Long story short I have been ordering to jerk off in front of me, go down on me, fuck me with a dildo, beg me for oral, fucking everything. I am on cloud nine. We have never been more in love. We had sex 4 times today. TODAY! Well, twice was just oral but I fucking love giving and receiving oral so it definitely counts as sex to me.

We've become the gross 'still crazy in love even though we are parents heading towards middle age' couple. 


A tldr of my last post: Husband like to be dominated. Sex life turns around.

Funnily enough, the domming stuff while extremely fun, is only something we do once every several months now, but the quantity of sex has stayed extremely high and we are both incredibly satisfied and smug about it.

The resentment being totally gone and all the sexual desires being on the table means that even if we have to go 5 days without sex because of sick kids or late nights in work there are still moments of intimacy stolen throughout the day. 

I cannot emphasize how much resentment and non-communication kills a bedroom. I know how frustrating that sounds when you're the one trying to communicate, but if you just banish the resentment and fling enough love at them you have a better chance of opening the lines of communication.

Good luck people, I hope you find happiness with or without your partners.

We're all in a terrible, frustrating, painful situation. And the majority of people on this subreddit are so in the thick of it they can't see out, and certainly can't see any way to help others.

While it's important to have somewhere to vent, I really joined this sub looking for advice, and to help others figure this out. What I found is that the advice which gets upvoted tends to be the stuff that reaffirms our bitterness, encouraging people to.divorce, or have an affair. There are people who offer pro relationship advice, but too often it sits at the bottom of the thread.

There are things mods could do to improve this: give more weight to the relationship healing strategies by enshrining some of them in the sidebar. Define this more visibly as a community of people who want to RECOVER from their dead bedrooms, rather than just getting out or getting off at any cost. They could even set mod standards around it. Instead of being a place where people go to rebuild their struggling relationships, it strikes me as a place where struggling relationships go to die... and they get to bitch about it on the way.

Well, I've recovered from my DB. We've been having sex 1-2x per week for 6 months now, and the connection is only getting better. But this sub just pulls me back into thinking about it as a dying thing that I should give up on. It's not healthy, it's not helpful, and it's hurting my ability to continue progress.

Specifically, I quit initiating sex because one night I made advances and he yelled at me, telling me I was always the one who initiated sex, and sometimes he just wanted to cuddle. Rejection hurts, but being made to feel like a horny bitch hurts way more. I decided not to initiate sex again until he did, which might seem immature, but really it was to spare myself the humiliation. Several years later, we haven't had sex ever again. I guess he was right. It was always me. Even when we were naked in the shower together, which used to happen fairly often, he only got aroused once. I quit showering with him, because I just couldn't take the constant rejection anymore.

We've been going to counseling for a couple of years to work out our problems, and at first it showed promise, but I think it was false hope. One of my biggest complaints in this relationship was lack of sex. We talked it through, about how we need to schedule alone time to make sure that there was opportunity for sexual advances, and two years later, there are only excuses. One of the excuses is that we watch TV too often to have sex. So, I quit asking him if he wanted to watch our shows together. Now, the only time we spend together as a couple is when we're out of the house, or when he wants to watch TV and I agree to watch it with him. He never wants to just be alone with me.

At one point I realized, this guy really only wants me to change. He only wants me to do the work. He wants me to solve all of the problems, including our sex life. And frankly, I'm not going to solve our sex life for us. I'm not going to be the only player in this game. So, I gave up. Being in this relationship apparently means I have to hang up my sex drive for the rest of my life. I've been trying to be ok with this.

He knows I occasionally read Reddit, so imagine my surprise when I find his comments here on /r/deadbedrooms, detailing how far gone our sex life is, and how it's because I'm unaffectionate.

1342165020.0,62,self.DeadBedrooms,whmux,Advice to DBers contemplating affairs...,75,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/whmux/advice_to_dbers_contemplating_affairs/,"I've been getting some PMs asking me about how I (successfully?) stray outside of my marriage to fulfill my sexual needs. And in light of a recent post here, this is something I felt I should say to everyone considering going down the path of the Dark Side. There are a lot of things I could talk about, from maintaining secrecy to logistics, but there's one thing first and foremost that, if you are seriously considering this, you **HAVE TO DO**. I'm putting it in bold and caps because it is that important

**You must recommit yourself to your current partner.**

Ideally, you married or are together with your current partners for many reasons aside from sex. And if you are choosing infidelity over divorce/separation, there has to be a few good reasons why you want to stick around. Yes, you are sexually frustrated, but take a moment, right now, to appreciate your partner for everything else they bring to the table. 

Now you'll want to make a silent vow to your partner. You're going to do this, and in return you will let go of the anger, the disappointment, the resentment. Stop expecting sex from them. It's something they've told and shown you they're not capable of, so continuing to demand it from them only sets the both of you up for failure. Stop taking their rejection personally. This is something many of us should do even if we aren't planning on having affairs.

Also, vow that you will never prioritize a fwb or sex partner over your partner/home life. If having to choose between the two (and such situations will come up!) you will always choose your current partner. Set ground rules if you must - for example mine are that I never stay the night, never on weekends, and I try to make sure that during a week my time at home is more than my time away - and that includes time with friends/personal time as well. 

Remember that new and casual relationships are awesome because you only get the best of each other. Even if the unthinkable happened and you left your partner for your new relationship, there is no guarantee you won't end up in a sexless relationship again. Even if you get sex daily your new partner might be worse than your old one in every other aspect. If you have kids, can you justify taking away their home life just to make you happy? Treat sex friends as friends and nothing more - you wouldn't prioritize your poker buddies or your shopping clique over your relationship. Same deal for the friends you just happen to have sex with. 

This is something you must actively do. It is too easy to develop feelings for a sex friend/FWB, especially the longer that relationship goes on and double-especially if you don't have any other FWB's to help balance it out. If you know the pitfall, that's the first crucial step in avoiding it.

I'm not advocating my lifestyle choice. I know I've chosen to become the villain, I've come to terms with my decision. Some people will never agree with what I'm doing. That's fine. All I ask is if you are one of those people, don't just reflexively downvote this. There are people who need to see it.

I spent the night with the most handsome, considerate, kind, funny, and sexually spontaneous man that I could have ever hoped to meet. We laughed, and snuggled, and napped, and fucked....A LOT, and it was better than the best sex that I thought that I had ever had. Multitudes better. 
Even worse, I really like this guy. I like spending time with him, we have a lot of things in common, and I think we're very good together, it's not strictly carnal. I think we're going to be the best fwbs ever.
Worse yet, I now find myself constantly either elated or depressed. At home, with my husband, or in situations that should otherwise be fun for me, I find myself incredibly sad. I now know what I'm missing, and it's utterly devastatingly unfair. I'm more aware now than ever of how miserable my relationship is, and how powerless I am (for now at least) to change my situation. I feel like my heart is turned inside out, and it's a much more poignant feeling than the constant frustration and confusion of my dead bedroom and uncommunicative spouse. I no longer care if he ever touches me again, I'm merely biding my time, but at this rate, the amount of time involved (year and a half max) seems endless. I wouldn't be wrong to assume that these feelings of having severely shortchanged myself will intensify rather than decline, would I?

I was in a DB for years and I tried everything - toys, outfits, videos, sexy texts/emails/notes, web-cam, porn, baths, back rubs, teasing, withholding, begging, crying, anger, resignation, ultimatums...everything.  I was with the person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with and since other aspects of our relationship were so solid, I figured eventually this too would work itself out.  Ultimately, trying so hard and for so long wrecked my self-esteem and eventually wrecked the relationship.  I didn't want to give up because I felt that the lack of sex wasn't worth throwing in the towel on the whole thing and so I kept on trying.  We had ""The Talk"" numerous times and while we both acknowledged there was a difference in libidos, we still tried to make it work.  Until one morning after yet another frustrating night where I cried myself to sleep.  My partner had the courage to break things off that I lacked and I was devastated for a month.  And then I realized that I was still a sexual human being and that there were people out there who would feel the same way.

I have now been in a relationship for over a year with someone I never could have dreamed of meeting.  We're compatible in more ways than I was with my ex (which I honestly didn't think was possible) and our sex is AMAZING.  As in, 4-5 times a week, sometimes twice-on-a-weeknight amazing.  I am comfortable in all aspects of this relationship and happier than I've ever been.

I'll bold the important parts because I'm rambling.

**Cole's notes backstory: 2.5 year relationship. Honeymoon stage sex life for 6 months, tapered off to 2 times a month and only at my insistence, numerous talks got nowhere but more frustration, I stopped initiating at his request &amp; out of guilt, and sex stopped happening. G-rated physical affection remained but the lack of sex was a huge elephant in the room.**

I had to admit to myself that the *talks* weren't creating any change.  And while I wished that simple communication was the answer, my SO often stated that I get too wordy when I have serious conversations, and it intimidated him as he didn't know how to put his emotions/reasons for his low libido into words, (aside from ""I don't know"" and ""I don't want to talk about it."")  **In fact, the talks were only making things worse as I put pressure on him to change something he felt he had no control over and couldn't explain.** 

I started coming up with worst-case reasons in my head for all of this: Is he secretly gay? Pretty damn sure he isn't.  Does he have some strange fetish he doesn't want to reveal to me? I'd given him countless opportunities to voice such a thing. Is he depressed? His work situation isn't great, and it could be taking a toll on his ego...  All that was left was something more simple: **He's lacking self confidence; which struck me as odd because I think he's the most handsome, awesome person in the world. But I really wasn't telling him that, ever.**  

So I stopped worrying about the sex we weren't having. I stopped resenting him about *putting me through this* and shifted focus to my own happiness and how I could help him and myself. I stopped censoring myself too; before, I avoided any and all mention of sex out of shame and taboo, but then I started making raunchy jokes and lighthearted sexual puns. I randomly told him how hot he looked, I segued into conversation how smart, well-liked and charismatic he was.  And despite my reservations about our relationship due to our undesirable sex life, I talked about our future together.  **It was a two-part initiative: care more about his feelings by giving him confidence in himself and the relationship, and start going after what I want steadfastly, with less emotion and apprehension attached to it.** 

I used to shy away from initiating out of constant rejection and the assumption he didn't like sex.  But **I realized a lot of my ""initiating"" was painfully subtle, and was instead putting the onus on *him* to initiate from my hints.**  Now, if I wanted sex, I grabbed him and I kissed him, and if he didn't kiss me back then, well that was shitty, but at least I had my answer instead of pining away, wanting to cry in bed for being too embarrassed to just touch my boyfriend. I would simply try again another night.

And then something just clicked, and he started wanting it too. He started initiating in the mornings, once a week like clockwork on sunday morning, when previously we'd only ever had sex in the evening before going to bed. And while the routine was beginning to get predictable, I knew that if it didn't happen friday night, or saturday night, I *knew* it was gonna happen sunday morning. And every time it did happen I rewarded his efforts with more affection, more flirting, and more compliments; not because I was trying to train his brain but because it was sincere.  Bringing the sex back instantly healed the cracks in the relationship and bridged emotional gaps between us.  Our dead bedroom was a two-way street: my constant pushing about the issue and his refusal to extend an olive branch of sexy times in return.  **We were both lost in a downward spiral sparked by something I'm still not sure of. What I know is I was so afraid of rejection and what horrible reason he may have for his low libido, and he was downtrodden by my constant need to talk about it, which only brought his self confidence lower.**  Neither of us what providing the other with what they needed.  I'll admit I wish we didn't have to pussy-foot around this for the majority of our relationship, and I was damn close to leaving towards the end of last year before **deciding to stop being a victim in my own relationship.**  A couple months ago he even initiated entirely spontaneous sex during the afternoon, which hasn't happened in well over two years!  I make a point to initiate some weeks, and let him initiate other weeks, neither party is left feeling like sex is a chore.

I don't really know how to sum this all up, but I'm grateful for all the stories and support this community has given me, mostly just to open my eyes to the fact that dead bedrooms are a real thing for couples of any age.  Sometimes you gotta stop focusing so much on what you want, and more so on what your partner needs/what they're missing. I'm of the opinion now that **if the sex life was there initially, and then disappeared, there's a piece of the puzzle that's missing, be it attraction, emotional well-being, or physical well-being/health.**  Sometimes you just gotta cut and run if you can't restore what used to be there. And other times you gotta figure out what that missing piece is, but in the end you can only change yourself and your behavior to invite the affection you crave; you cannot change your partner.

**TL;DR - Sex life went to shit. Stopped initiating out of fear of rejection and fear of pushing him, got lost in my head about all the little details that might make it better or worse.  Cut myself loose from my reservations and started behaving flirtatious again.  Stopped making painfully subtle sexual advances expecting him to pick up on it, and just went for it.  Complimented the shit out of him and made sure he knew it was sincere.  Nurtured his self confidence despite my anger towards him at the time and saw steady changes in his sexual attitude as well as my happiness.**

This is how I used to think. It kept me in a dead bedroom for years. I kept focusing n self improvement instead of making the situation a problem. I gave her space so she wouldnt feel pressured. What I really did was let her continue the fantasy that things were ok. When I finally snapped and left it was messy and out of nowhere.

So my message to all of you is to stop taking all the blame just to have some control again. If your SO doesn't know then make sure they do. If you arent in Counseling you should be. It is very complex and very difficult to work out on your own.

Sex has always been a problem for us, but since we got married last year, it's been more noticeable to me. I've realized that by marrying him, I had contracted the rest of my life to feeling this way. Fuck this.

We've talked about it before, to minimal results. I *believe* he wants to try, but just like with everything else we attempt to do without really wanting to, it fades away after a few weeks or months. I feel like he regards our sex life in the same way I regard that 20 lbs I want to lose--I *want* to lose them, but man, I just don't want to work out and eat right. So the idea that he is viewing our sex like that makes it even more depressing to me.

I discovered DeadBedrooms yesterday. Holy fucking shit. I felt like you all crawled into my brain and reported your findings on the internet. I started to cry, and I knew that I had one of 2 options: leave now (because CHRIST this is a bleak subreddit), or try one last time. One. Last. Time.

About an hour ago I told my husband that I'm not happy. I told him everything. How I feel ugly, and stupid. How I feel like we're roommates and would be better off as friends. How I'm done making myself feel guilty for wanting to have sex with my husband. How, right now, I'm exhausted and I don't feel like I can try anymore.

Despite the above paragraph, it was actually a very productive and respectful conversation. Nobody yelled. No one called anybody any names. There was no fingerpointing, with the exception of him saying that this was ""all my fault"", meaning himself. I told him that either one of us blaming anyone wasn't productive, but he said, ""We both know it's me. I need to fix this."" 

He promised to try. He promised that he would start initiating, and being more sexual with me. He promised that he would start taking ownership of his half of our relationship.

I told him that this had to be a change he was willing to implement for the rest of our lives. This wasn't like a diet he could do for a few weeks until I forgot about his promise. I told him, verbatim, the following: ""If this doesn't change, then we *will* get divorced at some point. That isn't a threat, or an ultimatum, or me trying to be mean. It's what will happen because you cannot expect anyone to happily live their life this way.""

I thought I'd share my thoughts, since in some cases, there may be hope for your relationship! That said, I am not trying to imply that these ideas will work for you (maybe you've tried everything), just offering some supportive help from one who has been there. 
 
Stats: We're in our late 30's 
No kids (by choice) 
Had a dead bedroom for years
We both got VERY lazy and complacent, my low self-esteem was a huge factor
 
My wake-up call was when a bff of mine started cheating on her husband. She had been complaining since the birth of her 2nd son 2 years prior that her husband never touched her, and how it was destroying her self-esteem. And it happened gradually, and he was resistant to her advances (and tears, and discussions) so she felt she had no options.  
 
That scared me because I could see myself going down that gradual slope. I thought about what I really wanted as a sex life, and I realized I wanted a healthy, happy, active kickass sex life. So I just started taking steps to make it happen. 
 
1.  I realized that I can't change other people, only myself. No more blame games. It didn't matter who didn't want it. I was going to work on myself. 
2.  My demons were: Minor abuse as a child (nutted up, went to therapy, fortunately mine was not that bad, got a good, healthy handle on things.) Low self-esteem (listened to The Psychology of Achievement and other motivational stuff, stepped up my game at work and home, stopped the negative self-talk, did things that gave me feelings of accomplishment.) And finally, a weird awkwardness about sex. I just realized that my husband was the person I love and trust most in the world. If I couldn't talk to my own sex partner about sex, then I should just hang up the crotchless panties now and walk away. 
3.  On the low self-esteem front - this was hard. Maybe the hardest part of this. But I had to give up the dream that surely next week I would wake up looking like a nineteen year-old supermodel, and THEN I'd feel comfortable naked. I had to accept myself as I am. It was hard, because my vanity was on the line. So I do things like taking better care of myself, including skin and keeping my nails manicured, NOT for him, but because I felt way sexier. (No need to spend $, I do my nails myself) I bought a few nice outfits, I started wearing makeup every day. I kept my legs shaved daily no matter what (way easier to enjoy spontaneous boning if you're not worried about being hairy) And mostly, I just had to stop thinking about how I looked, because it wasn't stopping him, and my negative thoughts were stopping me from having fun. 
4.  Invested in us. After one of our talks, I blew $200 on lingerie and sex toys. Not a luxury at all - our marriage and sex life is worth $200. The absolute fun of opening those plain brown boxes was like horndog Christmas. These were an investment, and absolutely worth every penny.  
5.  I started telling him exactly what I wanted him to do.  No more making him guess. I basically took responsibility for my own pleasure, and found that he was an extremely eager participant. He loves me, of course he wants me to feel good. KNowing that allowed me to focus on myself a little more, and that was what I needed. We also try to make things are physically comfortable as possible, nobody will get naked if we're freezing our asses off. 

We're not perfect, but we went from 2x per year to 3x per week and things are better than ever. I hope this can help someone.

I knew what I wanted to do.  I asked if she wanted to go lay down.  She gave me the 'deer in headlights' look and said, ""but my legs are hairy.""  I said, ""Listen Hon, you fart on me in your sleep and I still want you.""  Luckily she has a sense of humor.  ""I don't care if your legs are hairy, lets just go see what happens.  If you get into it, that's great.  If not, I can take care of myself later.""  She agreed but wanted to shave her legs first.  I'm glad I bought her that electric razor she never uses because she probably wouldn't have shaved if she had to get wet and this never would have gotten off the ground.

About 9:30 she walks into the bedroom.  I could tell she was serious about giving it a try because she disrobed leaving only her socks.  She climbed into bed and layed on her stomach.  I rubbed her back while laying beside her and we talked about our weekend projects, the stray cat that's been hanging around lately and the every day topics.  I didn't look at the clock but we spend easily 20 or 30 minutes just talking and touching each other.  If we had done nothing else, I still would have been happy.

She fussed for a moment and I asked what was wrong.  ""Just taking off my socks.""  I know what that means.  The stupid grin on my face was so big I could barely kiss her back.  ""There's my girl"", I thought to myself.  I found her again.

At one point, I accidentally tickled her and she elbowed me in the face.  Good thing she hits like a girl.  I suggested we just back up everything and go back to cuddling until she got comfortable again.  It worked.  Soon we picked up where we left off and she soon after came hard, leg shakingly hard.  I know it was intense for her because she didn't get up right away to clean up, she just layed beside me with her head on my chest.  It was pure bliss.

I don't expect our frequency to improve any time soon and I'm sure this better than average experience is due to pent up energy from her failed attempt last weekend when she just couldn't get into it, but it's nice to see that we can still do it for each other after 12 years.

Let me start off by saying that our Dead Bedroom was a mild circumstance. We’ve been together for 3 years and have lived together for the majority. About half of that time frame contained amazing and consistent sex. Then suddenly, like a switch turned off, it just stopped. 

Me - 24 - Female - LL

“B” - 26 - Male - HL

During the good times of our relationship, we both initiated sex an equal amount. Things were great -- we were happy, loving and understanding of each other. Slowly but surely, like all relationships, the frequency of sex slowed. I suddenly found myself annoyed with things that never bothered me before. Our work schedules had changed and I thought that that was maybe the reason for my sudden loss in sex drive. Then the sex stopped on the weekends even when both of us had nothing better to do but screw each other’s brains out. I began making excuses in my head as to why these things were happening. It was very clear that *he* wanted sex but I could never get myself in the mood. I wanted to *want* sex, but unfortunately, that’s just not enough to get me wet. It should be said that now looking back at this point in time, I realize that I stopped initiating sex.

I thought maybe the stresses of my job were causing me to be too tired after hours to have sex. So what did I do? I changed jobs. I thought maybe my birth control was suppressing my libido so I tried a different pill. I wanted to believe that the problems were external forces rather than internal ones. Our relationship was perfect before and I just yearned for that giddy-butterflies-in-my-stomach feeling again. Unfortunately, my efforts were exhausted and it seemed like nothing I did would change my libido. All in the meanwhile, B started developing what I would like to say were bad habits. 

B was clearly mentally drained of my excuses for not being in the mood. He suddenly started a routine of asking me for sex. He would say things like “Can we go eat dinner and then have sex?” or “Hey, come here, look at how hard my dick is!” all without any sort of follow-up affection or stimulation. It was as if he simply just expected me to suddenly cream my panties and jump on top of him when in fact, I wanted to run the other way.

Ultimately, our affection continued to decline. We would only share romantic kisses if he was trying to “get me in the mood”. Remember -- I stopped initiating. Because he only kissed me like that when he wanted something more, I stopped initiating kisses that were more than a peck as I didn’t want to lead him on. This turned into a never ending spiral of both of us feeling unfulfilled. It seemed like we were simply best friends who lived together and cuddled while sleeping occasionally. 

I was worn out from feeling pressure to have sex and I was worn from stressing over our relationship. I hated knowing that I wasn’t fulfilling all of B’s needs. We would have sex on occasion and for me it was simply just to get the deed done. He knew this and in the end, the guilt both of us held after those sessions was not worth continuing them. The next few months were the toughest that we’ve ever had. B had completely given up on even mentioning sex or trying to initiate in any way -- he now says he had just accepted the fact that I wasn’t sexually attracted to him anymore. 

Now I know this may sound strange, but the fact that he wasn’t even attempting to have sex any more hurt my ego even more. I already felt down on myself as a woman and as a girlfriend for not fulfilling his needs and now I felt even worse. I felt ugly and unattractive. I felt like an albatross and would hide in the bathroom when changing clothes -- something I was previously always comfortable about. My depression from my lack of self esteem only fed my new hatred for myself. I felt as though I had dug myself a hole that I couldn’t get out of. All in the meanwhile, I still wanted to want to have sex, but I just couldn’t.

It should be said that at this point I was not masturbating at all. It clearly wasn’t a lack of attraction for B, it was a lack of attraction for ANYTHING. The biggest mistake I made was not communicating with B and not letting him know this. I feel so horrible to this day knowing that he honestly thought I simply wasn’t attracted to him anymore.

Now I don’t know what happened but I started paying attention to things that turned me off. I started paying attention to the things going on in my mind while I tried to watch porn. It seemed like I had these endless trains of thoughts going on the back of my mind completely unrelated to the situation happening right before my eyes -- whether it be in porn or B giving one last effort to initiate sex. I was stressed. My mind would not focus on anything. Whether it be stressing over a long day at work or how dirty the house was -- I just couldn’t let go. 

I compiled a list of the issues I had and B really helped me overcome them. 

Some of this may sound silly, but here are a few things that have significantly helped our relationship. Please note that I’m not putting any of the blame for our DB on B, I simply wanted to compile a list that may be helpful for those on the other side.

- Try to help your SO relax. Cook them dinner or bring them something so they don’t have to worry about it. Try to help them calm their mind of any stresses they may have going on that day. Maybe they can't get in the mood to have sex because they are too busy worrying in the back of her mind about how dirty the house is or maybe their working out a problem she had at work that day in her head. Give them a gentle and short massage while they stand up doing something ordinary around the house. The trick is not making it seem like you're trying to coax them into sex right away. You don’t want them to feel pressured in any way by your actions.
- Start kissing again. I mean truly, passionate, full tongue kissing. Keep your hands in innocent places unless they lead them elsewhere.
- Start teasing again and regain the sexual tension. Play footsies under the table, make flirtatious and inappropriate jokes. Let them catch you staring at their ass.
- Don't fart or burp around them. I know you two may feel comfortable around each other but seriously, save that stuff for when you're in private. If it can’t be seen as attractive by your SO, then don’t do it around them. Same goes for smoking, nail biting or any other peeves they may have.
- If you're living together, try to keep your mutual spaces clean. Being in a dirty room isn't sexy even if they are the one who created the mess. Sexy lighting (not necessarily candles) and a sexy environment truly does help. Being in a dirty room sometimes makes us feel dirty -- and not in a good way. Additionally, make sure your space smells good. Incense and candles are nice, but as a woman, I love walking into a room after B just put on his cologne. It smells delicious!
- Shower them with compliments. As a girl, sometimes we get these silly ideas in our head that we don't look attractive so we don't want to take our clothes off. You know those days where she doesn't wear make up and you think she looks absolutely gorgeous that way? We tend to think the opposite of ourselves. We think we look like shit when we just tie our hair back and don't ""get ready"" in the morning. I assume men have their “off” days as well. Help your SO overcome what insecurities they may have about their appearance.  

We're still recovering, but the sex is slowly becoming more frequent and my LL is now gone. I masturbate more than I would like to admit I do. I feel better about myself and I've taught myself how to just ""let go"" again and take my mind off of things that aren't related to the moment. It's taking a lot of work but it's nice to see that our efforts -- on both sides -- aren't going unnoticed. 

**Additional Reading** - *Mating in Captivity* by Esther Perel - Though I don't agree with everything this book had to say, it really gave me some important insight on a man's way of thinking about affection versus a woman's. Genders view affection differently which usually tends to be the route cause of a lot of our dead bedrooms it seems.

To everyone out there still hoping, I urge you to face the music.  (S)he isn't sexually attracted to you.  (S)he never was.  (S)he got tired of putting the effort into faking it and that's why your sex life dropped off.  (S)he loves you as a friend and companion and in the beginning thought that would be enough.  (S)he thought that as long as (s)he kept you happy it would be ok.  But (s)he got tired of your sexual demands and couldn't keep up.  (S)he is hurting just as much as you are and is as scared of losing you just as much as you are of losing (him/her).  But eventually you both know what has to happen.  It's unfortunate but necessary.

All the crap about responsive desire and Athol Kay and seduction science is there to delay the inevitable.  Maintaining the status quo is easy, at least for a while.  I knew I needed to get divorced 2 years ago but put it off because of all that false hope.  Now, I wish I had done this 2 years ago.  It's far better to deal with it and move on.

1367081631.0,56,self.DeadBedrooms,1d81en,Resentment for my wife might be what finally murders our bedroom.,63,7,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1d81en/resentment_for_my_wife_might_be_what_finally/,"Long time reader first time poster.  Throwaway of course. 

My wife and I have been married for 6 years and together for 2 before that. 2 kids 4yo &amp; 5yo single income family so she can stay home and be the mother she so desperately wanted to be all her life.

When we first met she was around 200 pounds with quite severe self esteem issues. She had never had a healthy relationship and been pressured quite a bit by various guys who just saw her as an easy target including a few drunken ne nighters with close male friends who pulled the whole ""this was a bad idea and isn't going anywhere.. bit one more round before I leave is fine right?"" routine on her the next morning. 

She had never had an orgasm or been with anyone who even cared if she was enjoying it or not.  Not even close.  

The literal moment we met she knew I was the man she wanted to marry (her words) and she turned out to be right.  We got to know each other as friends through mutual acquaintances and eventually got together. She discovered she was multi-orgasmic on our first bedroom encounter and i discovered her total lack of self awareness or entitlement. Moved in. Got engaged. Got married. Fell pregnant on the honeymoon then sex basically stopped due to her pelvis being too tender after the first trimester.  We did coax a couple of ultra-slow and gentle rounds in the final week to try and bring on labor.  Worse than pity sex (sorry to be bitter or negative about that but it just made me feel like a neglected piece of meat she finally found a use for... Getting that baby out ASAP!)

So 3 months after bubs had arrived we did have sex again... And fell pregnant.  Again.

This time there was even LESS sexual contact. We tried twice and while she had multiple orgasms we had to stop before I could climax due to pain. However, she was asking for (and getting) manual relief from me for her rampaging hormones at least once a fortnight with not a single offer or suggestion of returning the favor. The next relief I got was 8 weeks after bubs was born by which time I was almost inconsolable about it.  That very morning I had to take myself for a 4 HOUR walk to calm myself down about the state of our relationship and remind myself that I was the least important thing on her radar for a reason.. We had two babies. 

Our sex life now is terrible. She has put on enough weight that i find her physically repulsive and seems to have no motivation to lose it (240-250 pounds?). It makes sex HARD regardless of who is on top. Something she was never even confident enough to do until about a year ago which i had to coax her into because getting on top of her was so.... unappealing that i couldn't keep an erection. Of course I didnt tell her that. Now her belly literally presses down against my stomach so hard that it makes me feel like I'm going to gag on my own stomach acid.  She hates giving head and is also utterly CRAP at it because it clearly disgusts her. The 5-6 times she has done it in our relationship I have been encouraging and patient and tried to help guide her but she doesn't even keep at it long because its ""too much effort"". 

She gets upset that we keep going through cycles of just being ""room mates"" or that she is afraid of rejection if she initiates.  Which usually entails being engulfed by sudden bad breath sloppy open mouthed attempts at kissing me for 10 seconds and then I'm supposed to be aroused and taking over so she can lay back and be ravished.  But these cycles are a symptom of us BOTH going through LL periods for various reasons.

I'm wall of text rambling here but I just..... Have no idea how to fix our problems. 

Self esteem. Communication. Attraction. Honesty. 

I don't mean to blow my own trumpet but I HAVE always been endlessly supportive and encouraging of her. I work 70 hour weeks and devote time to her and the kids at the expense of time to myself and at the exclusion of all personal hobbies.  I have sacrificed every luxury in my life to put her through study and establish her own business which she has done nothing with for the past year!  Despite her still talking about the things her ""business"" needs to be 100% what she envisions while she stays home and works maybe 4 hours a fortnight......

I basically don't WANT her most of the time now. I just eventually get so frustrated that I initiate and she never refuses because she always orgasms repeatedly. But then I feel dirty and neglected and resentful and unfulfilled because although I climax it's really an anti-climax. 

We currently average once a month which is how long it takes for me to get frustrated to the point where I do something about it.  I don't feel valued or important to her. I don't believe her when she says she loves me. 

We have had the talk. Three times now with no lasting effect. Her cellulite continues to spread and my needs continue to not register on her radar. But the worst part of it all is she is SO FUCKING UNHAPPY with her life and I know there is nothing more I can possibly do for her. The only person who can make her happy is her. 

I love her more today than I ever did, but our relationship is almost poisonous now and I have no idea what to do or say or do about it. 

Sorry for the wall-of-vent. I'm just at a total loss and am not even expressing myself well.  I feel for all of you and your stories and wish our loved ones could know just how much we love them and how much we want them despite the hurt they inflict on us. 

TL;DR I love my wife but am too hurt to contribute anything positive to our marriage anymore.

I am sharing my experience here in hopes that it will help someone else out. I strongly encourage any couples in a dead bedroom situation to give this system a serious try.

Here's how scheduling sex works for us: we pick a mutually agreed upon date and time to have sex, and stay committed to that date. Even if neither of us is feeling particularly horny at that date and time, we go through with it anyways to avoid slacking off and getting lazy about the system. 

Now I know that this all sounds incredibly unromantic, and believe me, I had the exact same concerns. However, we have yet to have an unpleasant experience with this system. Although we're rarely in the mood when the appointed time arrives, once we get started, we end up having a lot fun together. Thanks to our scheduled appointments, what would have been a normally sexless night turns out really quite pleasant for the both of us. 

One reason why this system works out so well for us is that it takes away the pressure and uncertainty surrounding our sex life. For me, knowing exactly when I'm going to get laid has significantly reduced my frustration, as I no longer have to worry about if and when it will happen. For him, having a regular schedule and knowing that it's meeting my needs has boosted his confidence and reduced an immense amount of stress. As an added bonus, getting rid of the stress and frustration surrounding our sex life has also improved the quality of our sex quite a bit.

Again, I understand how the idea of scheduling sex may sound unappealing and not very sexy, but I urge you all to keep an open mind and give it a try.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_u8jfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/u8jfy/scheduling_sex_has_turned_our_dead_bedroom_into_a/,

What worked for us..,55,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gkhnl/successfully_resuscitated_the_bedroom_what_worked/,"My wife and I are still very much in love, but over the past 5 years, our sex life was in a slow descent.  At first it went from 3 to 4 times a week, to 2, to 1, and eventually stretched out to about once every 6 weeks.   
   
For a while, when we were at about 2 times a month I couldn't mention the bedroom or going to bed without her accusing me of pressuring her into sex, then when it was down to once a month, I would get frustrated and we'd argue and she'd break down saying fine, she was a terrible wife, and wouldn't talk anymore.      
   
I stopped bringing up anything to do with sex after that and every now and then, she would initiate then lay there and we would have 1 position 10 minute sex.  Anything longer than that and she would get annoyed and want to stop.     
   
Those times got longer and longer and about the same time that we were up to about 6 week stretches, she started getting really paranoid.  She couldn't sleep at night, always accused me of cheating on her (I was never anywhere close to doing that), and was generally kind of a mess.  She was developing really bad social anxiety and would have mini panic attacks if she had too much on her mind or was soon to be with a group of people.   

The doctor prescribed Ambien and said the next step would be Xanax if that didn't work.  It didn't.  She started saying she was going to try the Xanax and I suggested that she stop taking the pill that she had been on for about 6 years first. That's when she freaked out on me.   
    
I couldn't believe her reaction at first, it was very unlike her, but she was going off on how I wasn't a doctor and how the fuck would I know what the pill was doing to her.  

I stuck with my position that before she took more drugs she should take less.  For some reason she took this very personally and after about 2 months of a really rocky marriage I finally laid it out that she was no longer the woman I married.  I have known her for almost 15 years and she had changed over the last 5.  I didn't even know how to interact with her anymore.   
    
That sunk in and a few weeks later she said she would go off the pill at the end of her cycle.   That was about 7 months ago.  Nothing changed for about 2 months, but her sleep was gradually getting better and by about 4 months her anxiety was gone.  For the last 2 months, sex has been as often as time will allow, 2-3 times week, and I have my wife and best friend back.  The change back to her old happy self has been amazing to watch.

Crazy, right? But let’s not get into a debate about that. Despite this, like most men, I have viewed porn on several occasions and have some ideas of what turns me on and what I wanted to do in bed when I got married. My wife on the other hand, has never viewed porn (she gets grossed out by boobs in movies) and has never really wanted to. For this and other reasons, she didn’t have much of an idea of what kinds of things turn her on or what she might want to do in bed, aside from typical foreplay/sex.

Enter Pinterest.

I joined Pinterest because I got sick of always eating food she made from recipes on pinterest and began pinning my own recipes. At some point, I discovered that pinterest has ""secret boards"" that only you, or someone you invite can see. I then had the idea to make a joint pin-board with my wife where we could pin types of lingerie that we both like and also pin ideas for sexy poses for sexting.

Since then, the ""sexy"" board as we call it, has morphed to just kind of include all things sexual. This includes funny quotes, naughty quotes, lingerie ideas, sext ideas, softcore pics, things to try in bed, etc. I think its a good alternative to porn for those who don’t really like it or want something a little less intense. It’s also a really a great way to share with your partner pics and ideas of things that you might want to do and see how they respond to it. When my wife and I look at it, I'll post something and she will just say, ""nah, that doesn’t really do it for me."" Or if she really likes it, she'll leave a comment on the pin saying ""lets do that!"" or something like that. Its also nice because when you pin things, you can leave little notes for your SO to read about the pin. Here are some pics so you can see what I mean: 

(NSFW)

http://imgur.com/ITymBQg 

Most importantly however, looking at the board turns my wife on and reminds her of all the fun things we've done together and gets her in the mood to do more. It’s by far our largest and favorite pinboard, and she told me the other day that she’s really glad we did this. 

**TLDR:** Start a secret board on pinterest with your SO and pin sexy things on it to help visually communicate sexual interests and ideas.

We're best friends everywhere else in life... I just want to be best friends in the bedroom too.

I said it through tears and we'd been sort of fighting and this was where the anger fell away and we just hugged.  It was a healing moment.

I'm working on the theory that if we can feel togetherness and friendship in the bedroom, it'll be a lot better (even if it's not sex) than feeling like opposition.

I could go into the long story about how I've struggled with the emotional aspect of insecurities and feeling broken and less of a woman because of vaginismus - but that's not what this story is about.
  
  
  
Earlier this week I was in an upbeat mood. I had a positive meeting with my physical therapist (one of my first meetings) and my SO and I had been talking about the issue a lot for several days. And then it hit me - we had been discussing this medial issue about my vagina and had not been intimate during that time. It was all about me, and I felt bad that focus had been lost on him (even though he didn't mention something).
  

 
  
So I decided I was going to pleasure him. I wasn't horny and it wasn't about any sexual satisfaction for myself. He was already laying in bed, clicking away at his phone, waiting for lights out and sleep time. I ripped the blankets off of him and made it very clear that I was in control of the situation. Normally, I am not a dominate person in the bedroom - but that night I felt fully empowered. 
  
  
Now let me be clear... I am not amazing at oral sex. I'm just not, and I won't delude myself into thinking I am. However, I know my man and I know what spots to focus on and how to use my hands &amp; mouth in a way that's sexually satisfying to him and fully in my comfort-zone. By the time I was done, he was in a semi-coma state of pleasure. 


For one of the first times ever, I had given oral sex **just because I could**. I wasn't horny. He had not indicated he was feeling neglected sexually. And you know what? **It was GREAT!** I didn't have to feel *sexually* satisfied from physical intimacy, I just felt satisfied from a job well done of pleasing my man.

I have finally hit my breaking point. I've posted here before, numerous times actually. I've read the sidebar, I've bought the books, I've had ""The Talk"" repeatedly, but last night finally came to a head. It's just not going to work. She suggested that maybe I need to find someone to make me happy, because she just isn't good enough to do it. She said that I am not the person you want. 

She's right. 

I want someone that treats me more like a husband and less like a roommate. She says that she loves me, but refuses to be the person that would reach out to me for no reason other than to do it. She will not initiate, I will always have to be the one that starts it. She hasn't initiated in years, after having our kids. 

I am terrified to do what i think i need to do, because my relationship with my kids will change forever. I saw my father go through the same thing, nearly 40 years with a woman who rejected him over and over but who finally showed emotion when he left; too late unfortunately. I'm glad for him, but angry at him at the same time. I bear the burden now of helping her rather than him, and i understand why he left. But I see a mirror of my situation. I live in a fantasy world hoping that one day she will make a turnaround and be the woman I remember her as, but her anxiety issues have paralyzed her. She can show touch love to the kids, and loves to cuddle with them. But I am limited to 10 minutes after lights are out with my arm around her, feeling like I am trying to hold onto a stack of lumber. She has put up her wall and has decided for us that this is how our life will be. I'll be dad to her kids. The life I have tried to build has failed. I feel like I have worked so hard with my career, my kids, her happiness, my happiness... 

But I can't live feeling like I am just an ornament in the house, like I am stranger when I try to kiss her, or feel like I am putting her off. Maybe she does love me, but not as a husband; but as the father of her kids or the caretaker of the house. She will not try, maybe i've been tossed to the land of the male friends and she will occasionally screw me just to keep peace. 

I'm trying not to cry at work; I'm the strong one, the one who keeps the cool head when things go wrong. Why can't I be the tough guy when it comes to this? Why the fuck do I need to physical touch to feel loved? Why do I feel like I'm going to explode when she's lying beside me, ignoring my presence. If I think of myself, I'll hurt my kids.. I'll be the dad that left when they were 7 and 2. Why the fuck does she do this?? Why doesn't she fucking care that this hurts me so bad but claims to love me. I hurt so damn bad right now, and tonight I'll go home and she'll act like our 2 am fight never happened. 

I have to compose myself now. In 20 minutes I need to be the leader again, I need to be the cool head guy and show strength.

I doubt that anyone who is on the opposite side of this situation browses this sub. But if you are the one who can't or won't show love to the other person for the sake of the other person, please do one of 2 things.

1. If you REALLY don't see them like that anymore, please let them know. Give them and yourself a chance to find happiness. Don't fight it, just do what is best for both of you and what is best for the others involved in the situation(kids). The anxiety you feel towards telling that other person that you don't love them like that will draw this situation out forever, and nobody will be happy.

2. If you really do LOVE the other person, try to see that they need to show and feel loved differently than you do. Whether you male or female, TRY to show that person, TRY to make an effort. Speaking for those in this situation, I would feel 1000 times better if I knew that there was actually some effort, some initiative, something other than what I am in now. It doesn't have to be a landslide of touches and kisses; start small. Let them know that you love them and that you will try to overcome whatever has come between you that has brought BOTH of you to this point. Move them from the bottom of the priority list to the top for a few minutes. And those of you that need touch to feel loved, remember that they might not get the same ache that you do for physical contact; and try to find what it is that does make them feel needed.

I have been with my partner for 5 years. First 4 were wonderful. The most exhilarating, dirty, mind blowing sex almost everyday. But for the last year, it has been once a month...if I am lucky. I have tried everything. 

We had the talk. He pretty much took 10% of the blame resting the other 90% on the 25 lbs I gained over 5 years. I could not deny I had gained weight. I was still attractive. I went from thin to thick. Not obese or disgusting. However, I could understand that he wanted the fit 19 year old body to bang. 

So, blaming myself, I hit the gym and dieted...hard. I have lost the weight. I am actually wearing the jeans I wore on our first date as I type this.

 So, considering this was 90% ""my fault"" for gaining weight, you'd think with the weight gone, the problem would be fixed. But alas, nothing. He hasn't even acknowledge the weight loss. Not a ""looking good, babe"" or ""Hey good lookin"" . Nothing. 

It's heart breaking. I am now having to beat men off me with a stick only to come home to an ice cold bed. The lease is up May 20th. It can't get here fast enough. I am not going to do the break up but still live together bullshit or pay 2 rents for 2 months. I am going to tough it out for the next 71 days. 

Just really makes me mad that I held up my end of the deal, but nothing changed. I can't wait to walk into the house wearing the outfit I wore on our first date and have a new ""the talk"" tonight. It will be glorious. 

So, I guess I wanted to lament to the people who feel like it's their fault because they have gained  weight. Sure it may contribute, but it can't be the only problem. You might bust your ass and still be waiting for your partner to thaw.

We arrive at this woman's home in the early evening and she brought us to a room in her basement.  Her kids were running around upstairs like a herd of elephants and she had an OAG wide-eyed look on her face.  She totally creeped me out.

We sit down and she asks us to tell her about ourselves and why we're there.  After telling my story about the bowling alley, her face immediately took on this look as if she was smelling something awful and she started with this attitude saying I'm a sick person and I need to do the majority of the work and I need individual counseling.  I couldn't believe what happened next.  My wife interjected saying this is crazy, that I was hard enough on myself and that I don't need to be punished for what happened.

Knowing that she's still got my back after everything that happened made my eyes well up.  It meant the world to me.

The woman was stunned.  She pulls this bible out of a drawer and starts flipping though the pages and I feel kinda bad for what happened next.  My wife and I both start laughing, practically in her face.  My wife is trying to contain herself, saying she's sorry while her mascara runs down her cheek.  That image is imprinted on my brain.  My wife is so beautiful when she laughs heartily.  We tell the woman that it's not going to work out and thank her for taking the time to see us.  

I didn't even have to skip my workout like I had thought.

Once we get home for the night, I ask my wife if she would like to spend some quality time together tomorrow evening.  She said she'd like that.

I have finally realized that the best thing anyone can do is, for starters, don't beg for it. You should not have to be begging for sex with someone you are in a relationship with, they should want to. When we fell in love you were more involved in other things, new things to your partner. Start going out with your friends! I went out with friends and not with my partner for the first time in a while and I forgot what it was like to have fun with MYSELF and without them. I've started going to the gym and working out more, eating better, reconnecting with friends I loved and lost contact with, I've picked up painting again, and am reading all these books I never had the chance to! Your happiness will show through to your partner and happiness is ALWAYS attractive. Believe me they will be far more attracted to a smile, and fun person to be around than someone who is upset all the time. It was REALLY hard to be around her all the time, and just..not getting any affection..her being rude..me being rude. It's a shit storm. Stepping back and really making an effort to do my own thing is the best thing I have done. It was hard at first. I told myself I could do this several times before I really got it down. But things just get boring if we do the same thing everyday. Things get to comfortable. People love new and different. I also started trying all sorts of weird new things in the bedroom to keep her on her toes. All in all (TLDR) just find happiness within yourself. Rely on yourself , and not someone else to make you feel good.


And if they don't..it's time to go. I cannot stress how much being healthier has helped. My spirits are so much higher,I look better, and I realized that I don't need to stay in a relationship that I do not like ever in my life because I can be absolutely okay being alone.

I have faith in you guys! This subreddit has really helped me out a lot. It's always nice to know you are not alone.

Thanks for listening folks.,56,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/vorc9/its_time_for_me_to_leave_this_subreddit_thanks/,"So my marriage has lasted 457 days.  It started off fantastic, but at the 4 month mark, she changed.  And every time I tried to figure out why (by asking) it was always just ""i'm tired.""  (note: she worked ridiculously long hours.)  The relationship became less and less... real.  Ultimately, I was living on the couch.  On a good day I'd get 10 words out of her (by asking 10 questions which garnered 1 word responses)  And, needless to say, the bedroom was dead.

I had said we should get divorced back in February, and she cried and was very upset.  This surprised me, I honestly thought she just no longer had feelings for me.  So I agreed to stay and we'd try to work it out.  And, honestly, I think she did try, but it didn't get much results.

So last night we had our first real talk in a long time.  (and half a bottle of Fernet) and we're separating.  She'll keep the place (Its a rental), and I'm looking for a new one.  Unlike the first time we almost split up, this conversation went really well.  I think we were both just exhausted.  She said the real problem is that she just can't handle cohabitation.  We live in a small place due to downtown prices.

I love her.  And I'm sad that this couldn't work out.  But I also feel very relieved.  Wondering why it was the way it was, and feeling helpless to do anything about it was torture.

I tried everything I could think of to get her interested.  It caused many fights.  I was depressed, angry, cynical, etc...   It was an emotional roller coaster.  I finally took stock of my life/marriage and realized that it was pointless because she actually was never really into it and I just would never admit it.  She was denying me one month into our sexual relationship and I actually was taking care of myself on our honeymoon.  Somehow I thought that was normal?

Well, going by the theory that you can only really get back what you once had, and that we didn't have much, I resigned myself to just suck it up and be the best dad I could to our children.  Leaving just doesn't seem like an option.  If I don't bother her about affection and intimacy, we get along just fine as basically roommates and raise our children.  The children are happy and so I must find a way to be happy as well with the life I made.  Most days it's good and I love my children more than anything, but days like today I feel like shit.  I've learned to cope.  I've built up a huge wall around that part of me that desires intimacy and passion in a relationship - something I've never experienced really.  I just shut off those emotions and find other ways to be happy.  Sometimes though it boils over and I have to address it.

How can she be so content to go for weeks on end with not even a hug?  I have to initiate 99% of the intimacy and it's very clear it's all for me.  I can't comprehend someone who is this unemotional and adverse to affection.  Why is she so insensitive to any of my feelings?  Even when I'm sick or in the emergency room she's annoyed.  ""Suck it up"".  I've heard that more than I would like.  She doesn't know how to deal with someone with any emotions and it's not like I'm some basket case.  I'm just a man who wants a wife who is there for him and desires him.  And she just seems so happy going on that way.  Everything is always 'fine'.  It seems so robotic and unemotional to me.  Sure, she gets a little spark of libido every now and then (maybe every month or every other month) and then we go have the same sex we always have had.  Everything else is gross.  Bodily fluids are gross.  The smell is gross.  Just vanilla and get to orgasm as quick as possible.  I don't even bother any more.  I don't want duty sex.  I don't want sex where any of my fantasies are ignored or where it's only for me.

In the end I know that you can't make someone be something they aren't.  She's too set in her ways to change.  She'll never be a sexual being I know that.  She'll always be 'fine'.  She'll never really care if we hug or kiss passionately.  Take it or leave it.   I also know that my life is pretty good outside of that.  Being roommates with your spouse and having a good life is not the end of the world.  I have an amazing family and I won't take them for granted.  I will always wonder though about what it would have been like to have a passionate relationship and be with a woman who is actually attracted to you.

In any event, I returned to say that I went through with it. While I will spare the details other than to say that I spent several hours in the sack with a relative stranger, I am here to freely admit that I feel absolutely awful. 

 This feeling, I would note, is not as some of you no doubt expect , the product of guilt.  Rather, I was given a brief glimpse into a world that has been foreign to me for all too long. A world in which partners desire one another, where hours can pass sharing an intimacy that has been all but lacking from my life all too long.  That we had sex is really something of an afterthought as it is the other aspects of my evening that continue to carve a hollow into my soul and which occupy my waking thoughts. The feel of her hair on my chest, the way she interlaced her fingers with mine during the moment of her orgasm, . . .  

In short, this only served to bring into sharper focus my deep unhappiness. Whether I will take action by doing what I know I must to fill the void inside of me remains an unlikely prospect and I must admit that I have no words of real insight to share other than that, for me, cheating has only deepened my sadness.

1360648650.0,46,self.DeadBedrooms,18d31q,[update2] What I did about my dead bedroom,55,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18d31q/update2_what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/,"Update on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/133vo9/update_what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/102ah8/what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/)...

I've seen posts on here about people who have a day or a week of sex and are dealing with the 'will it last' anxiety. Things have been going well for my wife and I for a while now and we are still working things out. I felt, when the bed was still dead, that everything was 'ok' and that all we needed was for there to be more sex.

What fixed our problem was me realizing that things were not good. In fact, I was as much of the problem as anything - I was emotionally distant and not meeting her emotional needs. I'm an [INTP](http://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) and she's a [ISFJ](http://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality) - I'm a very abstract thinker and a fairly unemotional person by nature, and she's quite the opposite. 

Our lives are really different now that I've left the '[man box]'(http://www.charlieglickman.com/2011/05/the-performance-of-masculinty/) and understand what she needs from me. She's seen me change, and I think it led her to listen to what I want in the relationship - some physical intimacy. Like many, I didn't want 'duty sex' I wanted her to want me. So rather than put her in [this situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18bmjh/7_steps_to_never_fix_the_problem_in_your_dead/c8dky9s) I did all I could to understand how to be a man she'd want to fuck. And we did pretty good, by keeping communication open.

I found myself still having 'triggers'. One morning I woke early to piss, 4am or so, and couldn't get back to sleep because of something that had left me feeling uneasy about 'things between us'. After a while, I said, 'relax, everything is OK, it's 6am, she's getting up soon anyway, go and spoon her and then she'll wake up and we'll do hugs and touch, and things will be fine.' So I get in bed, slide over, she wakes up, and then boom, jumps out of bed, ""I'm late, I forgot to set the alarm!"" and off she goes to the shower. (She had an 'observation' by her boss at work that day and was anxious about it.) It *really* hurt. I knew in my head she had just woke up, had no idea really even what her name was much less the emotional drama I'd put myself through the last few hours and there was nothing to this, put the feelings on the shelf until you can talk about it later.

But I couldn't.

And she could tell. And so she kind of felt it was out of the blue and wtf? and we have kids and jobs and there's no time to really talk and so we left for work upset. And as our discussion of things continues in the nooks and crannies of our life, the communication wasn't great, and before long I'm saying I want us to get counselling. I was feeling like she was going along, and going along quite admirably, frankly, for 9 months or so, but I had insecurities that she wasn't taking initiative. That it was on me to keep her engaged sexually and that if for whatever reason I laid back on keeping things physical, then, well, they'd slowly go away.

We make an appointment for the counsellor and *even though I had never actually brought up my anxiety that she wasn't taking initiative* she took the initiative and suggested that we have some time, 15 minutes each night, where we just spend some time in bed hugging and cuddling. Wow. I can't say how many times I feel like she's read my mind in the last 8 months or so. Amazing.

So we went to a counsellor and the feeling I am getting is that she wants me 'fixed'. That she thinks she gets it, that I have a problem with anxiety and that we are communicating enough and we are talking to the counsellor and she's giving me advice on how to deal with anxiety and I feel crushing disappointment that now my wife *and this authority figure* both have decided I'm broken. But inside I know how I felt after 10 years of deadbedroom, and its just making me crazy. I *should* have stood up, asked for a moment to collect myself and left, come back and said, ""Wait, I feel very misunderstood here."" or at least even ""Something isn't right, I need some time to think about it, let's talk about something else for a while."" But I don't process emotions very quickly like that, I find I need a day or two or more to figure out my feelings, quite honestly. So instead I just kind of sat on things, let the hour finish, and left my wife with (an honest) ""I need to process things a bit.""

Thennnn her brother came over for dinner (uninvited, bless his heart), stayed late, and we didn't get to talk that night and she went to bed anxious about what I was thinking and somewhere in the middle of the night I read an email she had sent about wanting to know what was up. And something in the email hit on that note of her not knowing how deep in the hole I was, how totally broken down emotionally I was. This unspoken sentiment, ""right in this house, I was dying inside and you didn't do anything."" That feeling.

But here is the thing. I was talking to myself and not to her. How could she know how I felt, because *I had never told her*. I had never told her because our communication wasn't that open, because she would have felt I was blaming her, she would have started crying and I would have run from the emotion. But, at counselling, that would have been *exactly* the time to share those feelings. To say, ""When I'd shave in the morning, I'd watch the water flush the soap and whiskers from between the blades of my razor and the word 'suicide' would pop into my head."" But I didn't say that at counselling, instead what I did was hold my feelings back, not say anything, and then, after a few beers at 3AM I wrote a reply to my wife that was full of *totally fucking crazy*. Not murderous crazy or schizophrenic crazy, but pretty childishly expressed sentiments of 'I want sex!'.

And that email bounced back and forth about a dozen times between us with lots of 'wtf' before we finally sat on the couch after the kids were in bed and talked. She felt betrayed and sad and confused. I felt embarrassed and angry and misunderstood. And we talked. We talked for a while, and we kept it *totally fucking civil*. We treated each other with respect and we talked about or feelings. I stepped back from some of the extreme things I said, and she told me that she for the first time had actually planned on what life would be like if I wasn't there. And by the time it was done, we'd reconnected. We'd been reading a book the counsellor recommended ""Hold Me Tight"" (very hard to read, so full of *feelings*, ugh, not a joke, my wife found it hard to deal with). I read about 'attachment anxiety' and various other quite helpful comments, and frankly its quite lucky because it gave me the words to explain what was freaking me out. 

It was quite shocking the way things returned to normal. Among other things, I said, 'no sex for a month at least, I need to get that distraction off my mind and it will obviously be awkward anyway'. It lasted about a day, if I recall correctly. I'm also going to therapy on my own for now, reading the book gave me some sense that perhaps I need some conversation about having felt disconnected all my life. It's been a recurring theme when I talk about families - my dad was pretty distant, as a middle child of 4 and with an older brother with 'issues' I didn't get much attention and my personality is the kind to withdraw anyway.... So I have been to a counsellor, and so far it's been a lot of 'tell me your story.' I also dug back into some Meyers-Briggs stuff, and I think that perhaps my feelings of emotional remoteness are just the way I'm put together. Plus, I have some things I want to discuss anyway.

So, I have been feeling pretty even the last 2 weeks or so since our big '*discussion*'. One thing we both wanted from that discussion was how to have the same openness when we talk without also having a huge fight.

tl;dr: bringing a deadbedroom back to life is a really bumpy road. You have to trust your partner as best you can. Don't talk to the person in your head, talk to the person in your bed.

It seems to me that in the event the HL (high libido) party decides to leave the relationship because of (among other reasons) the Dead Bedroom, the LL (low libido) party often says something along the lines of, ""so you're ending this X-year-long relationship/marriage over sex.""  This statement has, to me, two intended effects:

1. It minimizes the importance of a healthy sexual relationship.

2. It characterizes the HL partner as somewhat of a deviant, or at least someone who has trouble putting all the other important reasons for a healthy relationship in the property priority.

For purposes of this post, I'm going to ignore both of those intended effects and focus on why the statement is just plain wrong. It's not about sex.  It's about respect.

Here is how I'd respond to the statement: 

No, I'm not leaving ""over sex."" I'm leaving because, over the years, I have told you how important this issue is to me. We've had ""the talk"" many times. We've gone to counseling. I have tried to solve this problem by myself. I have even gone to the extreme point of leaving you alone, not mentioning our sex life, for, literally, years.  I have been more than patient.  I see now that, from your perspective, there is no ""problem"" or ""issue"" at all. In fact, my attempts to solve this problem by being patient have taken it off your radar completely.  

In the meantime, I have responded to your stated needs in this relationship (keeping the kitchen clean, minding the finances, etc.) if not to your exact specifications, at least in a prompt and positive manner. I do this because I respect your wishes.  Although we may not agree on, for instance, the importance of stacking the Tupperware ""just so,"" I have recognized its importance to you and have changed my behavior to accommodate your wishes.  I do so because I respect your wishes and want you to see that I value your opinion on matters that are important to you.

I have seen by your behavior and words that you have no corresponding respect for me.

A lot of people do NOT want to change, they want their partner to change. If only their partner would see / realize / understand, then surely they will change and everything will be fine. 
 
So they wait, and they wish, and they complain, and they wish some more, and they argue and talk and discuss, and wish and wish and wish. 
 
At some point you'd think it would become clear: YOU CAN'T CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE. Ever. Sometimes people do change, yes, IF and when they make that decision for themselves. But it will have nothing to do with you and you have zero control over whether or not someone else changes.  The only person you can change in your relationship is YOU.  
 
So if your relationship isn't where you want it to be, you have two choices. 
 
1.  Take control of what you can, such as your own physical and mental health, finances, personal surroundings, and making sure you are creating the life you want. That means accepting that you can NEVER change your partner, or make them want to change, or give them 2,000 good reasons why they should change. You need to decide what to change ABOUT YOURSELF to create the life and relationship you want. That might mean therapy for you (if your partner will go, great, but don't expect it, count on it, or force it - again, you can only change YOU). It might mean accepting you have a low libido partner, and just loving them for who they are even if you're unfulfilled. Living that way is a choice too. Or maybe you decide to cheat, or leave altogether. The point is you have to make the choice. 
 
OR:
 
2.  Keep wishing! Wish and wish and wish for your partner to change. Hey, maybe tomorrow he'll wake up and realize how logical and sensible it is to have sex with the person you love more than anyone. Maybe if you just explain it a little better, the person who has been giving you the cold shoulder for months will suddenly say ""Oh, he's right, I've been a fool and now I want that body!"" Do you see that happening? You can never, ever change your partner. But you sure can stay in a relationship where you are unfulfilled, and just wish and wish and wish your troubles away. Okay, sure, it hasn't worked so far. But... maybe you're just not wishing hard enough! In fact, while you're at it, why not wish for other things you have no control over? Let's all wish that we get magic unicorns. Because that's as likely as changing someone if they don't want to change. 
 
Sorry to get ranty. Last night I had a 2-hour conversation with a friend who is in a bad relationship, and he wants his gf to change, and if she'd only change everything would be perfect, and he won't leave her because he loves her, so he just stays in misery and wishes and wishes and wishes she'll change.  It's been 3 years of misery and hell for him, he can walk away at any time, yet he just wallows in misery and complaints and wishes and wishes and wishes for her to change.  
 
Maybe tomorrow she will. Maybe the end of the week. Maybe it'll be another three years of hell and misery. Maybe a lifetime. But rather than do the painful, hard work of making changes in himself, he'll just live with the pain and misery of being in love with a woman who is not compatible with him and will never change. 
 
Hey, as long as we focus on wishing, we never have to look to ourselves and make hard choices! Yay! ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_143qvy,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/143qvy/just_wish_your_db_worries_away/,

In every other way we have a good relationship though, and we love each other very much.  We've been together for 8 years, we're both early 30s, fit, socially active, financially secure, and most people would never guess we're in a DB. Our problem is that she has become pretty much asexual, no desire at all.

I hope that's enough background.

Anyway, some events have come up in my life, and I haven't seen my wife in 4 months. Now she is coming home in a few days, and I have had a huge realization:

**It is so much better to be alone than to be with someone who is a daily reminder of what you're missing.** 

Getting no sexual affection while being alone has been so much easier than getting no sexual affection from someone who is there. For me, the soul-crushing part of not getting sex is knowing my partner isn't turned on by me, and not having her around has lifted that pain. The real damage comes through the rejection from someone you care about, and is supposed to care about you. In the last four months I have felt so much better about myself, and I find it way easier to simply go without sex than to be denied sex and affection. I'm not saying that being alone is great, or that it's a walk in the park, but it's been so much better than the alternative a lot of us face.

Before we started having major relationship issues, we had sex the perfect amount for both of us, 1-3 times a week, on a regular basis.

The problem? He's unemployed, plays video games constantly, is a total slob and doesn't mind living in filth (which I utterly refuse to do), can't do anything without being nagged and has constant legal issues from driving without a license. I work full time, do a majority of the housework and cleaning and generally coordinate and drive all the major efforts in our lives. For example, I just planned a week long vacation to San Diego that I will pay for almost entirely myself. He always says he'll change and never does. 

So, I don't want to fuck the adult child that is my husband. I'd rather masturbate in the shower and feel generally sexually dissatisfied all the time. 

Oh, also, he's consistently lied to me about the fact that he watches porn. He'll even persist in trying to lie when we've received letters from Cox asking us to stop DLing illegal shit and the title of the movie is something like ""big titties 4."" I came home from work unannounced today and he was fucking jerking off to porn. To be clear, it's the constantly lying that's the problem here...not the porn.

Just to state, this isn't the passive-aggressive ""I'm just not going to initiate, see how they like it"" that we've all done I'm sure, but an ""agreed"" period of non-initiation.

I also want to be clear that there is a difference between the medically unable to have sex (ED, Extreme pain/discomfort/etc) and the just-LL partner scenario.  Yes, they can be interlinked (depression, medications, birth control), but at least in theory these are also ""controllable"" - change depression medications, change birth control methods, etc.  This post is expressly dealing with the latter, not the former.

Am I the only person who sees the ""sex vacation"" as effectively us, the HL partner, admitting that the problem is ours?  That we are the one that's ""wrong"" when it comes to sex?  That somehow our desires for sex &amp; intimacy are the fault?

With respect to all our LL partners out there...we're normal human beings who want sex with our spouses/SO's.  We're not freaks, addicts, or perverts...we don't even just want to ""just blow a load"" and move on...we want the intimacy with our partner.

I propose that the ""sex vacation"" is a steaming pile of donkey shit.  I find it offensive that the answer to not having sex is....not having sex.

I get it.  You don't ""feel like"" having sex this moment.  Well guess what?  Us HL people don't always ""feel like"" having sex either, but that we're always wanting and willing to have that intimacy with our partners.  We're willing to work ourselves into the mood at the drop of a hat because we care about you, not just stuffing our penises in your vaginas (or vice-versa).

Hell, I know from experience that the rare times I can ""convince"" my partner to ""give it a shot"" that it ends up in good orgasmic sex for both of us.  It isn't that we're always horny either...but that we want to please you.

If the ""sex vacation"" is supposed to be legitimate, I propose the opposite as just as legitimate...the ""refusal vacation"" - where ""no"" is not remotely an acceptable word in our LL partner's vocabulary for a agreed upon period of time (obviously not raping them either).

I'm sick of feeling like I'm some fucking freak or pervert because I want more sexual contact with my wife...and as far as I'm concerned, the ""sex vacation"" only re-inforces that perception.

For those of you that this has worked for...I'm happy for you.  I'm glad you found your intimacy again.  Most of us haven't been so lucky.

Thoughts?  Does this make sense at all?  Or am I just an asshole?

We caught a movie and had dinner, then retired off to a hotel for sex. I can't put my finger on why, but by the time we got to the hotel I was kind of tired and out of sorts. Nonetheless we had sex - the first round was good. We were laying around together as I was trying to get over my recovery period. It was getting late and I wanted to get another go in, so I started some foreplay leading into round 2. I wasn't very erect the whole time and basically had to coax my penis into getting hard. I was able to penetrate and get some action in, but when I went to change positions I went soft and I knew it wasn't coming back. So I closed out by doing some things for her, kisses, caresses, touches, etc. Not the best sex of my career but I'm still happy with the evening.

On the way home I realized that I hadn't been horny for pretty much the entire day. I had sex with her for no other reason than I wanted to have sex. I enjoyed it not because it felt awesome and I had powerful orgasms, but because I wanted to enjoy the act of sex with a woman who desired me. This entire encounter was driven by my mentality, not my physiology.

One thing I hear often from LL partners is that you're simply just ""not in the mood"". You don't feel horny and don't actively desire sex. I believe that from a strictly physical standpoint, we HL partners go through the same thing - we're tired, stressed out, distracted, etc. The difference is that our desire for sex is a psychological one. The closest I can describe it is eating not because you're hungry or are even craving that specific food, but because you know its delicious and you're going to enjoy it. 

So if you are wondering how to kick-start your sex drive, I think the best place to start is how you approach it mentally. Don't wait for your body to make the decision for you. Make sex something you want to do for whatever reason - you enjoy the closeness, you like the sensations, you enjoy making your partner feel good. Even if your body isn't responding - can't get hard or wet - there are many other things you can do that's not PIV sex that still feels good and can be enjoyable for the both of you. Limiting yourself to only when you're ""in the mood"" takes away a lot of sex you can potentially be having.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_yvlrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/yvlrp/to_our_lowlibido_partnersfriends_a_suggestion/,

It still ended disastrously.",53,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/rct36/i_was_the_lower_sexdrive_partner_and_i_did/,"I guess I just want to share my story.

I'm 29f, just coming out of a 3 year relationship with my ex, who is 25m.  We lived together the last 2 years of the relationship.  When we first got together 3 years ago, we both had a high sex drive and a lot of passion for each other. 

About a year and a half later, my sex drive suddenly and inexplicably vanished.  I went from having a moderately high sex drive, to none whatsoever.  Sex wasn't unpleasant, it just lost all appeal.  It felt like a lot of exhausting and pointless work.  The change was dramatic and overnight, and I was confused and devastated.  I never realized how much my sex drive was a part of my identity until it was gone.

I blame birth control.  But it took me a very long time to realize that birth control was the problem, because I hadn't made any birth control changes.  And I didn't realize that a change that dramatic could sneak up on you when you've been taking the same pill for years.

I got off the pill once I realized, and I got a copper IUD - the only non-hormonal option.  But the damage was done, and recovering my sex drive was a very slow process.

In the meantime, I was extremely mindful of how this was going to affect my boyfriend, whose sex drive was as high as ever.  

I had been in his position before.  Years before him, I dated a guy with a very low sex drive.  I was constantly sexually frustrated, constantly rejected.  I knew that it's more than just wanting orgasms, I knew that it makes you feel unwanted, unattractive, unloved, worthless.  And I still found my boyfriend very attractive, it's just that my hormones made the sex act unappealing.  

So I did everything I could.  I kept communication open, and I explained many times that he is attractive, that it's a purely medical thing, that I still love him and still find him attractive.  I made it a priority to have sex with him as much as I could stand to, I would make the effort to say yes as often as I could.  And we were still having sex an average of twice a week, sometimes more.

I went and saw a doctor.  I got my hormone levels checked, but it didn't really tell us anything.  Basically, hormone levels fluctuate so much that in order to know anything useful, they'd need multiple levels throughout the month PLUS they would need multiple levels throughout the month BEFORE my sex drive dropped.  All they could tell is that I don't have any key hormones missing - for example, my testosterone isn't zero.  

I got a copper IUD, the only non hormonal reliable birth control that exists.  It was painful to insert, and it lead to more painful cramping, but this was a price I was willing to pay to get my sex drive back.

But it wasn't quite the same.  He has an overly high sex drive if anything, he wants it multiple times a day, and twice a week wasn't enough.  Also, he missed feeling the passion on both ends.  I wasn't doing the dead fish thing, in fact I think we were having some very good sex during that time, but no amount of cheerful effort is quite the same thing as a partner who is desperately horny for you and can't wait to rip your clothes off - and he wasn't getting that from me.

I understood this.  I'm not a very jealous person, and I trusted that he really loved me.  And I wanted him to have the things that I couldnt' quite offer him.  So I gave him an open relationship.

Well, he kept breaking all the rules.  He brought a girl home and fucked her downstairs while I was upstairs - I'd made it very clear that I didn't want that in my house while I was here or while there was any chance that I might come home.  Originally I had said he could have one-off things but nothing ongoing with the same girl, but he pushed and pushed until I finally agreed to let him keep seeing the same girl.  Then he started taking her out on a lot of things that seemed like dates, as well as doing lots of favors for her.  Then he told me that it's only a one way open relationship - I figured we were both allowed to go outside the relationship, but I was voluntarily choosing not to act on it.  Well it turns out no, he wants permission but won't give me the same permission.  Then there were lies, where I'd find out later that he was doing more than he was actually telling me.  And when he would come home, he would be distant and feel weird, it was coming between us.  During this time, I also learned that he had cheated on me and had a purely physical affair with another girl, right when my sex drive first dropped a few months earlier.

I finally put my foot down and said that enough is enough.  And he agreed to close the relationship.  But it turns out that in his mind, he simply decided to stop telling me about his affairs with other women.

The affairs continued but I didn't know, I thought things were better.  Also, as we are now about a year later from when I got my IUD, my sex drive is slowly coming back.  It's not quite as strong as it used to be but there are times I'm genuinely horny for him, and I am continuing to make that effort even when I'm not.  

Then, out of seemingly nowhere, one day he starts giving me this speech about how he's not happy, he hasn't been happy for a long time, he needs some time away to figure himself out, he wants us to take a break and he wants to move out.  From the tone, it sounds like he's pretty final that he doesn't want to fix anything or figure anything out or even try.  He's saying he wants a break and maybe we can talk in a month, but it sounds like he's really wanting out.

It makes no sense.  Everything was fine.  I try to talk to him but I can tell he's just not open to anything I""m saying.  

He goes to bed.  I can't sleep at all.  I hear his phone make a noise like he's getting a text message.  And for the first time in our entire 3 year relationship, I go check his text messages.  And I discover not only that he's having lots of sex with this other woman, but at the end of it he's texting her all about how stagnant and stuck he is but how she's his motivation to move forward and get out etc - basically, saying he wants to leave me for her.

Four months earlier, he had been shopping for engagement rings for me, and had told me so.  And I had decided to say yes.  It was a given, it was just a matter of time.

We broke up.  I took the high road, I never lashed out at him.  But he moved out immediately.  I can't even describe the devastation.  It's the single most painful thing I've ever been through in my life.

It's been a little over four months.  I'm better now, I'm dating around, and hey, my sex drive is just fine.  He and the other woman had a very tumultuous relationship and finally broke up, and he's coming back to me now talking about what a horrible mistake he made with me.  But it's too late.

I'm not sure what my point is.

I'd like to start off by saying that I am in no way qualified as a therapist or counseller. I'm just someone who's been there and can see it from your perspective. I'll also go out on a limb and say that this advice (and anything helpful you get out of it, really) can be helpful if you're a guy or a girl. Please remember that this issue is NOT black and white. So many factors are at play with human sexuality. Look at absolutely everything before you decide that not being with your partner is the right thing to do. Often times, there could be a relatively simple fix that will allow you to both be happy and be together for a long time. Don't blow that chance.

I had written up my own very long-winded tale, but it plus the advice section proved too large to fit within a Reddit post. If you're truly interested in my story, then let me know and I'll post it separately.

If you're living in a sexless relationship, My heart goes out to you. Your situation may be similar to mine, but simply ending it may not be the way to go. If you truly love your partner and want to make it work, do everything you possibly can to be together. Like i said, I'm no sex therapist, but I've lived the situation and gone through many of the different treatment types available. I hope that this proves to be at least a little helpful. Also, as i said before, you can AMA in the comments below.

**DETERMINE IF THERE ACTUALLY IS A PROBLEM**

Think about it: are you like me, living with your partner and only having sex once every couple of months? Or do you have infrequent sex because of time commitment, job issues etc? If the sex you have enjoyable? Does your partner initiate? Do they seem into it? Do they care if you have a good time or not? If the sex is good when you are having it, then your problem isn't as bad as you may think. Talk to them about frequency.

**DO NOT ASSUME THAT IT WILL JUST FIX ITSELF**

If you really do believe that it's an issue, you have to do something about it. the problem will not just go away on its own. Take action.

**TELL YOUR PARTNER HOW YOU FEEL**

Seems pretty basic, but you're not going to get anywhere if you're not communicating. You need to sit your partner down and be as non-confrontational as possible. For the love of god, don't try to talk to them after a failed sexual encounter. If it degrades into an argument, stop talking about it until you both calm down. If you start fighting about it, the problem WILL get worse. You need to be completely calm, supportive, and open to everything they have to say. Let them know that you've noticed you've been less intimate lately and that it's a concern for you. Communicate your needs. tell them how it's made you feel. You have to be firm with this point. Your partner MUST understand that this is an issue for you, and that it's not something that they can just brush aside. Ask them if anything has changed in the relationship. Ask them if anything is stressing them out or if there is anything you've been doing that you may not have noticed. Get them to open up in any way you can.

A healthy relationship consists of two people who listen to each other and honestly care about how the other feels. Couples who don't share are doomed to fail. always. Above all, you MUST communicate the fact that you're interested in having a healthy sexual relationship with them and them alone. You can get off with anyone.... You're Intimate with the one you love.

**LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY**

If you succeed in getting them to open up, do not, under any circumstances, get upset over what they tell you. they'll close themselves off and the problem WILL get worse. There will be tears on both sides, and, if your partner trusts you completely, you may hear things that you hadn't even considered. Past abuse for example. Physical issues. Depression/Mental problems. Poor body image. The solution may be as simple as getting some romance back in your life, or as tough as heavy medication and physical therapy. You're never going to know until you have that conversation and hear them out. And after that, you may have to...

**ACKNOWLEDGE ANYTHING THAT IS YOUR FAULT**

Odds are, you're like me and have been playing the victim for a while now. Because of this, you may have already decided that there's absolutely nothing more you could be doing, and the problem resides 100% in your partner. It's never that black and white. It can be painful to the Ego, but the problem could reside in you. Perhaps you don't talk to them as much anymore. Or you don't do things together. This is where the romance part comes in... dates, movies, cooking... Spending time with one another… not quick fixes, but a stepping stone.

It could be worse though. Maybe they're bored with your sex life. Do you do the same thing over and over again? Do you take the time to please them or only care about your own needs? Has anything changed about you physically? have you put on weight? Perhaps they aren't attracted to you any more. Sucks to hear, but it could very well be the issue.

If you're part of the problem, then man/woman the fuck up and talk about how it can be solved. If you need to spend more time with them, then do it. If you've packed on a few pounds, put some effort in to lose it. If you aren't doing it for them in the bedroom, then communicate how you both can make that better. If you really want to situation to change, then you may have to share the blame. Do this graciously. your partner won't forget it.

**DON'T BLAME YOURSELF COMPLETELY**

Seems counter to the last bullet, but you cannot bear the brunt of this yourself. these problems always stem from a lack of communication, and it takes two to tango. Even if the problem is partly you (or all you), your partner is just as much to blame about letting the lack of intimacy get to the point that it is now. They should have voiced their concerns earlier. Sure, it can be tough to tell your partner that they're putting on weight or that they don't have any idea where the clitoris is, but these conversations NEED TO HAPPEN EARLY. Your partner shouldn't have been so mousey and just come out and said it. the problem could have been nipped in the bud sooner, and you guys could have been having more happy moments than arguments.

It could turn out that the only thing you've done wrong is not communicating your needs. This was my situation. I waited too long and things went haywire. If you are only guilty of waiting too long, then remind yourself of this often. Do not start picking yourself apart. Do not beat yourself up. As said above, it takes two to Tango, and as tempting as it is for some people to play the blame game, you CANNOT do it here. If you need to, go to your partner for reassurance. If they care for you, they'll give it. If you're feeling down about your body, then hit the gym, or post a pic of yourself in r/gonewild. It sounds trite and narcissistic, but everyone deserves to have their ego stroked (haha) once in a while. don't be ashamed of fishing for it.

**DO NOT TAKE THE RELATIONSHIP TO ANOTHER LEVEL**

Ask yourself: Why would you want to take a relationship to another level when you're unsatisfied with your sex life? My ex-girlfriend convinced me that moving in together would solve all of our sexual problems. IT WON'T. Neither will joining bank accounts, buying a house, having a child, or getting married. Doing any of things serves nothing other to make the problem much, much worse than it is, as you're more committed to this person than before. do NOT Let your partner convince you otherwise. It sounds harsh, but they have to know that the relationship will not progress unless this problem is fixed.

**CONFIDE IN SOMEONE**

I told absolutely no one i knew about what was happening in my relationship. Part of this was shame, of course.... I blamed myself and was scared that i would be seen as a wimp who couldn't please his woman. Do not think that you can deal with this by yourself. Many folks believe that you shouldn't ""air dirty laundry"" and that your partner should be the absolute only one you talk to about relationship issues. this is total horseshit. Holding it inside will only increase your frustration and may cause you to become, as I was, an emotional basketcase. Find a friend or relative that you trust completely and confide in them. seek someone nonjudgemental, who will offer advice only if asked. Sometimes, it can be good just to vent. Or, you may find some insight that you hadn't thought of from someone who knows you and your partner well. Embarrassment be damned. Put yourself out there emotionally. Unless you choose to confide in a total asshole, they won't judge or think any less of you for it.

I'm a 25-year-old female whose relationships always seem to end up with a dead bedroom. The first few months are great, but I always get to a point where I think sex is just not really that appealing to me anymore. I can't keep my mind off chores/work/general grievances and really immerse myself in the act the way I can during the very first part of the relationship.

It's not like my drive is completely gone, either - I still masturbate (albeit not frequently), and I fantasize about having sex with other people I know. It's just that the thrill seems to fade away the more I get to know my partner (I know this sounds horrible, but that's the way it is).

Right now I'm in a relationship since about 1.5 years with a wonderful man whom I really do love and am attracted to. We had a longer-than-usual honeymoon phase (about a year, whereas I usually get tired after 3-4 months), and I thought that this time would be different and that I wouldn't get tired of it, but I'm starting to feel more and more unenthused by the prospect of sex with him for every day that passes. I really don't want to be this kind of person and I wish that I could just not be bored with sex once it gets a bit familiar, but I don't know what to do. :(

Anyways, about a month ago, I asked her if we could set a time alone for us. My wife usually always agrees with it, but then when it's time to be alone, something comes up(headache, sickness, kids, etc). At this point, we had not been intimate for a bout 4 months and it was eating at me. 

I asked her something during that week, if we could have some time for us. She agreed. Nothing happened. One day at work, I sent her a text:

""hey ,wanna have some fun tonight?"" 

Her response: All you do is think about sex!

That killed me. I usually never ask for it. It just so happened that I asked her twice in that week. When I got home, she kept rambling about how I always want it. I had alot of things I wanted to say but  I kept quiet.

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm sitting on the couch watching TV. My wife says, ""How come you never initiate anymore?"" I had to clarify what she was getting at so I said, ""Initiate what?"" She said, ""You know...sex?""

I mentioned [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/tc3on/i_dont_think_there_is_a_fix_to_this/) that I was doing the scrub-sponge thing. I also stopped expecting or even hoping for sex from my wife (least I could do, all things considering...). So on Saturday I again devoted myself to being a good husband and father, and simply let go of any sexual expectations, disappointment, frustration, whatever. We had a great family day. As the day was winding down, my wife made sure to show me she was moving the signal to ""Sex OK"".  So after the kids went to sleep we got down to business. She made more of an effort to actually be responsive, it was a big improvement from the last time. I went to finger her and she was already wet. We had good sex in multiple positions, and we both agreed that we hadn't had good sex like that since our dating stage. 

So skip to today. The signal is back at ""No Sex"", but that's fine. Yesterday was great, I'll just run with that for a little while. Again we had a great family day. At the end of the day we're both just lounging around. I've been thinking of ways to try and increase her overall interest in sex, so I ask if she wants to watch porn together. Just watch, no expecations of anything else. She says she's not really ""at that state of mind right now"" and I tell her I understand and it's okay. I suggest we go to sleep. She says ""Really? Just sleep? Are you okay with that?"" Knowing what she's getting at, I crane my head around to check the signal. Still at ""No Sex"".  She says ""Oh did I forget to move that? You could probably move that to the other position."" So I initiated and again she was more responsive. She even gave me a small BJ, something she hates doing! Again another round of good sex. I'm still in awe.

It wasn't perfect, but leagues better than the ""here you go"" sex she offered me last weekend. She actually got into it and enjoyed herself. And I have no idea if this will last, much less improve. But I'm really happy about it so I'm going to take this and run with it for awhile. Sorry for posting, but I figured DB could use some good news every now and then, and I don't have many other people I could talk to about this.

Thanks y'all!,45,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1jkrma/how_im_fixing_my_deadbedroom_llf_22_reddit_is/,"I have been married for just over a month. My husband and I had a good sex life for the first few months we were together. For the remainder of our relationship and engagement I was unable to have sex with him. We went through several months of infrequent sex, 9 months of absolutely no sex, and then went back to very infrequent sex. 

Emotional issues and physical pain combined with my inability to get very wet and a a general lack of sexual desire caused my LL. I am also a very busy person. Working full time, in school full time, part time internships, planning a wedding for about eight months, etc. I was always tired. I AM always tired. So that didn't help either.

A few months ago (about a month before the wedding) I decided I wanted to do something about it. I was sick of being the problem. We have ZERO other relationship issues. My husband is so understanding and never made me feel guilty about being unable to have sex with him. 

We slowly started having sex again. About once a month or so. And doing other sexual things about once a week. Thats when I found this subreddit. I had lurked on reddit before but never had an account. I decided to make an account and got pretty active all over the site. 

Hearing the stories everyone tells on this site had me more motivated than ever to fix my DB. I took some advice. I've stopped masturbating when I'm in the mood. Instead I wait until my mood matches up with a time that we're both home. The longer I do this, the more often these times seem to arise. I frequent subreddits like /r/sex, /r/porn_gifs and /r/porn which honestly helps to put me in the mood when I wouldn't usually be. I am starting to adopt the overall attitude reddit has toward sex.

We are having sex roughly once a week now. Both of us really enjoying it. We aren't exactly where I want to be. But we're getting there and you guys are helping me.

1369342033.0,43,self.DeadBedrooms,1exdwz,"""It's not you, it's me."" And....?",47,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1exdwz/its_not_you_its_me_and/,"I read a recent post where this was the response from the LL partner during a discussion about sex: ""It's not you, it's me"". We see this a lot here, right? I've always marveled at it. In my world as a HL person, hearing this is like someone saying ""You're standing on my foot."" And getting the reponse, ""I know, sorry about that."" instead of ""Whoops, let me move.""

I had a discussion with my wife last night about our recent visit with my sister. She doesn't get along with my sister well (my sister is one of those folks people either like or don't like). Meanwhile, my wife is someone who can get along with anyone. Buuuuuut…. Not my sister. (Lots of people don't get along with my sister.)

So we were hashing over some stuff that happened, primarily that we skipped mass. My sister is very Catholic and we are supposedly also, and she had god-fearing in-laws in the mix so I think it might have burned a little extra because it was 'public'. Long story short, my wife wanted to call my sister and see if she was bent out of shape and if so, say ""sorry"". So I reply with something like ""Why don't I call, she's my sister, I can say, 'we wish we'd have done things differently, I hope it wasn't too big a deal for you'."" My wife replied that she would do it all the same again, she's just sorry that it might have hurt my sister's feelings. I stumbled over this concept for a few minutes before it was clear to me that I understood this clearly.

And it dawned on me that this is the core sentiment of the ""It's not you, it's me"" response, in my opinion.

My wife wanted my sister to know that skipping mass wasn't about us trying to be disrespectful or careless of my sister's feelings or judging her faith or anything like that. She was worried that our actions might have made my sister feel insecure. But what my wife didn't get, that I explained to her, is that my sister isn't upset that we might be judging her, she's not feeling insecure in the least –she's upset that we didn't go to mass! It's about religion, it's not something we are going to work through.

So to translate this into a deadbedroom, consider this: when you LL partner says 'its not you, its me' what, perhaps, they are saying is, ""I don't know what to do about my failure to want sex, it's nothing you have done, I'm really sorry that it hurts your feelings, but you are blameless, it's all on me. I've given up, so I guess we'll have to just have this sexless second-rate marriage."" Why does this make sense to them? It's probably because they recognize that marriages are 'supposed' to have sex in them, and they can imagine how they would feel if you stopped wanting them – it would hurt their feelings, like if you forgot their birthday all the time or refused to go out on dates or something.

But it's not like that, is it? It's something that gnaws at the HL partner constantly, that they think about constantly, and that they want physically and that they can't just make 'peace' with.

So, I think one way for a HL partner to respond to this is to say, ""It hurts that you don't want me, and I appreciate that you might feel like you don't know what to do and that you've failed me somehow. But look, I still love you, and I don't blame you, but what we need to do is work together on this. I am glad that it's nothing I've done because I've really been trying, but we need to really understand this better. When we aren't being physical, it's not just that I feel like something is missing, I feel totally invisible. We really need to work on this because I know in my head you love me and I want to feel that way again in my heart. Let's get some sleep, and we can talk more about this when we've had a chance to sleep on it.""

Then, you take /u/sexagon 's good advice and next time you talk, you ask for regular discussions on the topic, and you talk about counseling or books you could read together or porn or how their feelings changed over time. And you do all of this in a supporting way. They see themselves as broken or 'sick', they are ashamed, and they likely will respond best to supportive offers of help.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1exdwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1exdwz/its_not_you_its_me_and/,

When I first laid eyes on my boyfriend 4 years ago I heard all the bells and angels singing and the fireworks went off. Oh how they went off and I knew he was it for me. He's been it for me ever since that night and no one else and nothing else has made me feel as fulfilled and loved as being with him. I never wanted to get married or have kids really, but when we got together I would've married him in a heartbeat and had kids if only to have more of him in the world. We were that couple. The ridiculous couple who love and respect and adore one another so much and so genuinely that you can't even be annoyed by the PDA. To this day when I look at him the fireworks go off, but I always stop them and remind myself that he hasn't touched--let alone fucked--me on purpose in months. 

The sex really started dwindling around the year and a half mark. It took me completely by surprise because he was 24. You don't expect your 24 year old red-blooded American boyfriend to lose interest in you sexually especially when you haven't gained any weight or changed your behavior. According to the media and society at large (it seems) a 24 year old man is supposed to be willing to have sex with you no matter what. Drunk, fat, pregnant, broken up, asleep, gay, dead. He's supposed to want sex so badly that he'd do anything for it and yet, mine would rather Reddit or clean or stare at a wall. It's to the point where any time anyone on tv or in a movie mentions anything about women being frigid and men being sex-crazed, he and I share a really awkward pregnant pause and avoid eye contact.

I used to get really upset about it and cry and try to talk to him about solutions which always ended in blank stares and shrugs from him even when asked direct questions about his feelings/desires/opinions. I got the feeling that not only does he not know how to put into words how he feels, he knows it would only serve to hurt me further because the answer is something along the lines of ""I'm just like this."" He's extremely stoic and seemingly emotionless naturally which is one of the things I actually found very comforting about him in the beginning, but is now the source of frustration and endless brick walls to understanding why I never get laid as a woman in my early 20's who is at least an 8 on a bad day. I'm sexy goddamn it fuck you! I have no gag reflex! I work out six times a week. I count every fucking calorie that so much as touches my skin and I give him massages, cook him meals, clean the house! And I used to do it all out of love and I used to genuinely like doing things for him, but now that's changing. Now the things I do make me angry because he doesn't care and apparently thinks of me as a roommate with tits that he sometimes touches. 

I could go have sex with the countless normal men in my life who are waiting out my relationship (there are many who have flat out told me this) but I have tunnel vision for him. Him not wanting me has made it even more important that he want me which turns him off more which gets me laid even less etc. forever. I stopped initiating very pointedly last year to see how long it would take for him to want it. Turns out we have sex roughly once every two months if I leave it entirely up to him. The worst part is, when he initiates that one time it still feels obligatory, chore-like, passionless and kinda gross because I'll be damned if I shave every day in case today is the day he happens to be a normal person. He will seem into it for about 30 seconds and then the moment I start to really get excited he shuts off. Immediately. It's so hurtful and insulting. I'm not allowed to be into it? I've told him that I don't even need to get off. I don't need massages or oral or any hour-long sessions. I want him to just barge in, tear my clothes off, have his way, and get off in two minutes if that's all he wants. Sex like that is actually really hot! Still nothing. He even turns down no-strings-attached blowjobs.

The closest he ever got to giving me any real tips on how to get him to fuck me was him saying that if I want sex I should just grab his cock and go for it with confidence. This technique has not proven useful and it's pretty laughable for him to tell me to grab his cock and jack him off when the minute I get near him with a sexual energy he heads for the hills. He refuses to talk about finding ways to up his libido such as herbs, hormones testing, or not masturbating. He claims he masturbates twice a week on average and I actually believe him. There's absolutely no part of me that thinks he's the least bit gay or cheating (We live in a small town. Cheating is damn near impossible.) It's like he's an alien. On our last anniversary I initiated against my better judgement and we ended up having obligatory sex where he just lays there praying for it to be over. So awesome. 

This relationship is coming to an end. For the first time today, I get it. We are just different. He's never going to be hornier than he is right now. I'm not going to get sexier than I am now and I sure as hell can't commit to this lifestyle.

We've been married for 5 years. Our sex life for the past two years has been up and down. I'd say much more down then up. Lately, I've been the one to initiate. I can't even remember the last time she initiated. My wife and I have discussed this numerous times and she tells me she will work on it.

So, the other morning, I'm lying in bed, wife is next to me and she puts her hand on my arm. Not in a sexual way, just lightly holding on. No rubbing, tickling, trying to get me in the mood. I don't take it as anything so I don't do anything. Later on that day, she says, ""You know, I wanted some this morning"". Then I spend about 5 minutes trying to explain that touching someone on the arm doesn't count as initiating and how about just letting me know you want to have sex. 

Her response-""OK""

That night, figuring she might want some, I roll over and start rubbing on her. She said, ""I wanted some earlier ,you know?"" I said, ""Yes, I know, we discussed this already."" She said, ""No, not this morning"".

Get this! She wanted some after I told her to let me know when she wanted sex. Her response of ""OK"" was for me to take it as she wanted sex.

I post in this subreddit somewhat frequently &amp; have a lot of redditor friends, so I'm using a throwaway.  Inspired by a recent thread, I want to tell you about my life &amp; see if it can help you. This is very fringe, a lot of people won't be open to it. If you can make it work, its amazing.

My darling lover was in a DB for about a decade before he met me. Same story, wife was a horn dog til the first kid and then the sex got rotten and infrequent.  Vicious fights led to the wife giving him a single command - go get that taken care of, I don't want to hear about it.  So he did. Never an emotional connection until me, and mostly massage parlor visits. It helped a little.

He is a very attractive man in his late thirties, early twenties myself. We met out and about &amp; he was very honest about his situation once we got around to talking about it - he loved his wife and wore his ring proudly, she just did not meet his needs and he accepted that. he loves her for who she is, LL and all. 

He was oddly detached from his sexuality when we first met, and we were friends for months before it headed to the bedroom. First it was just fooling around casually every couple weeks. Now we see each other every day, just for an hour or two usually, and make time to absolutely fuck like rabbits, at least five times a week. Sometimes twice a day. 

We are affectionate, flirtatious, cuddly &amp; silly. I am meeting a lot of his romantic needs. Because of this, he isn't bitter towards his wife anymore. He goes home and is happy. He isn't frustrated with her like he was before. He still tries to initiate, much less often (I think every couple weeks as opposed to almost daily before). She turns him down all the time, but he doesn't turn it into a fight anymore. Because he isn't frustrated or aggravated (due to lack of release and also a healthy outlet for nonsexual emotional intimacy), she's eased up too. She doesn't feel pressure. The energy between them cooled.

For the last five months, he's taken her out to dinner every saturday. She let him kiss her good morning the other day.

We have been ""seriously"" together a year, and they have fucked twice. Sure, not a lot. But more than the last few years. It's not awesome sex, she has a lot of rules and its pretty rigid. But it's a stepping stone. 

She is aware of my existence (vaguely) and isn't bitter. I'm helping her, I have helped her marriage - maybe even saved it. For her sex is a burden that I took over. For myself, and for my lover, we just like to fuck.  

I'm younger than my partner, getting started in my career fresh out of school. I have the typical 20-something libido, but am really busy with work. A normal relationship wouldn't work with me - I like flexing my independence and sleeping in my bed alone most of the time. There are a lot of females like me out there. My generation is sexually progressive, and this works. 

Monogamy is really, really difficult. As humans, we aren't great at it. With an open mind, we can overcome it and still love our partners.  This may be of no help to some, but it has certainly changed my life for the better. 

I recognize this may not go over well.  I just wanted to share and would be happy to expand on details if it could help someone.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_ysqn8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ysqn8/im_dating_a_married_man_and_i_saved_his_marriage/,

At one point I myself had considered if I was a sex addict, but reading everyone's stories here on DB and around I think I'm normal. There's nothing wrong with wanting sex on a regular basis, and not getting it can make you unhappy. So I feel she's wrong about her assessment.

She suggested we go together, and I intend to do that. I'm hoping that maybe the therapist will validate my position. It could backfire though and the therapist takes her side. We'll see.

She's very good at pushing my buttons but this time I didn't let it get to me.  There may be some truth to her complaint but I understood she was just taking her frustrations out on me and didn't really mean it.  I told her that normally I would be pissed about what she said but today she gets a pass.  I linked a picture of a baby donkey in an effort to cheer her up a bit and wished her a better remainder of the day.  She apologized for taking her frustrations out on me and suggested that maybe she just need to get laid.  Six months ago she never would have said that.  I didn't get my hopes up.

After work she jumped on me and dragged me off to bed.  She wasn't interested in making love however, she wanted me to ""fucking pound"" her.  I plowed her good and hard from behind.  We never even finished undressing and the whole thing took about 5 min.  Afterwards she thanked me for turning around her shitty day and we proceeded to have a pleasant evening.

So where did all this recent change come from?  I think her fitness success is improving her self esteem.  She's lost about 15lbs since December and it's starting to show.  I'm not the only one to notice either; she's been getting many compliments as of late.  I think things are going to be great for another long stretch if not forever.

I thought I was alone for so long; I thought I was ugly, undesirable, fat, stupid, needy, greedy, selfish, and all around a bad person for wanting him to want me sexually.  I told myself I was “broken” on a daily basis to deal with the pain that I was feeling, and for four years I cried myself to sleep in his arms wondering what I was doing wrong...until I found this subreddit.

I found that I wasn't alone.  I was given a glimpse into a future I couldn't live with, one with children and financial stability and material comforts, tainted by a constant yearning to leave if it “wasn't for the kids.”  I was told to mourn for my lost sex life. I was told that I never again would be found sexually desirable by my spouse for as long as I live.  I was told to cheat. I was told to masturbate.  I was told to hold onto the good that we had. I was told that it wasn't his fault, (nor was it mine!!), and that it would never truly get better.  Above all, though, I was told by your unspoken words to leave while I still had a chance. And I have. Your experiences gave me the tools to let go, and I can never thank you all enough. 

I come back now to remind me of what I left and what I never want to live again.  Your words give me the strength to push on, even though I'm a grown woman sleeping on an air mattress in her mother's living room.  I have found the strength to put myself out there again, even though it inevitably means I'll be hurt again, because I know now that I AM desirable and that I am NOT broken.  

So, again, thank you all for giving me the strength to pull myself up out of the coffin and walk again among the living.  It's nice and warm up here, and the view isn't too bad, either.

I found this subreddit by accident and I read my story over and over.  How closely I identify with the feelings and emotions felt by other men in our situation is what surprises me the most.  

I’m just like many of you.  Wife is awesome other than the sex drive part.  In that department: she NEVER initiates, has Vanilla sex when we do, never shows desire or that she is attracted to me, can go months without sex, is definitely not a partner is sex, when we do have sex, she rushes it and just wants it to be over.

Sex is not something she WANTS to do it’s something required of her.  Her idea of being sexually active is letting me know it is an appropriate time to have sex, not actually showing attraction or kissing me.

I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I am so frustrated.  Some nights I think my frustration is so obvious that she is going to let me know that “it’s ok to have sex tonight” but then my frustration is compounded when she just goes to sleep and I don’t even get that option.  If I initiate sex she goes into robot mode it’s pretty obvious she has to do it and is not into it – that is worst part – having sex with someone who you want to be your partner and them making them feel like you are taking something from them, not sharing something with them.  

We’ve been together for 13 years and for years I’ve tried talking to her and being very honest and open.  There might be little glimmers of hope here and there, but no real change in her.  I don’t know If I can change who she is.  We have two kids, I remember resenting having sex with her when we decided to have the first one because she turned into a sex monster when she decided she wanted to be pregnant, then turned it off again after she was.

I flat out told her last week She’s like my best friend and I love hanging out with her, but she is starting to not feel like my wife.  

Damn.

We have not had sex in 16 months at her choice now following a huge fight after the birth of our second son. Nothing. We are in Buffalo, NY, and NYS considers me ""abandoned"" and I could file for at-fault divorce due to this.  I have done everything I can to make up for my mistakes. She continues to accept no blame for her role (she has never accepted blame in our nine years together and has apologized to me for something precisely twice). I have forgiven her despite that because I JUST WANT TO MOVE ON but that's not going to happen. 

The once every couple months that I work up the nerve to ask for sex and get shot down I die a little bit more. I am always surprised to find that there is more dying I can feel. She doesn't care. Knows she is hitting me but does nothing about it. Counseling only prevented a hasty divorce last year.  I haven't cheated. Haven't considered it. Won't. I will not quit on this family.

I am never told I am a good father. I am never acknowledged for what I do, only reprimanded for what I don't. What can you do when someone doesn't actually care about how you feel? Or worse yet, when they know you are hurting but choose to maintain the status quo instead of pursuing changes to themselves.

And yet she is planning on a future in which we move to her native Italy in two years together. We never discussed that during our first years together, and I have no prospects of job there, just a very good very stable job here. How terrible. I am sure that it was only coincidence that this idea of moving back only came up after our first was born after years of mutual understanding that NY was our future. 

I can't divorce her because if I don't get custody the kids are GONE gone half way around the world. I am miserable and lost, but around those children and around my friends and acquaintances I am keeping up the act of being happy. No one suspects anything. I feel like a prisoner in this relationship just trying to hold on to my kids.  I just keep telling myself to keep up the act and go through the motions.

Why do we keep suggesting this as one of the top three ways to solve this?,48,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e06u8/solving_a_db_with_an_open_relationship_why_do_we/,"While I have not jumped into the subreddit for open relationships, my understanding of open relationships is that you basically have two hyper-sexed partners that are very very comfortable with their sexual dynamics and they in turn seek out excitement for both in a mutually understandable way.  That seems to be the only way that situation honestly works out.  That is a drastically different situation than what we are facing in this subreddit.  The possibility of an open relationship fixing a DB seems incredibly small, almost a nil chance at face value.

and with that I give you a quote from Arrested Development:
&gt;Tobias: You know, Lindsay, as a therapist, I have advised a number of couples to explore an open relationship where the couple remains emotionally committed, but free to explore extra-marital encounters.

&gt;Lindsay: Well, did it work for those people?

&gt;Tobias: No, it never does. I mean, these people somehow delude themselves into thinking it might, but ... But it might work for us.

The only purpose of suggesting an open relationship to our partners might be that they would hopefully perceive it as a threat to their comfort zone thereby compelling them into action.  Plus for some of us, it's not really a solution even if he/she agrees to it.  In the end what we want is a loving reciprocal partner that expresses love physically with us.  With an open relationship we still miss out on bonding with our partner.  I think the suggestion also boosts the LL persons argument that ""all you want to do is get off"".

Of course when I was in my DB my thoughts wandered to this and cheating as well.  Mulling over both of those focused me to finally end the relationship.  If I was willing to take a chance to inflict that much pain back onto my spouse then I should be willing to get through the pain of divorce.  Once you get down to the extremes of cheating or an open marriage it should trigger an inflection point of logic in you that exceeds your emotional connection to this person that obviously does not deeply love you.  Be the better person and leave at that point.

This is so painful, and the fact that it's going to my decision makes it even worse I think.

I'm a 30 year old male.  I've been in a dead bedroom for about 8 years (the entirety of my marriage).  My story is basically the same as everyone else's - fucked like rabbits, marriage, kids - now not only no sex, but no intimacy to speak of.  I feel like I'm missing a huge part of my life here - it makes me feel like shit.  I'm sure many can relate.

I'm so torn on this.  I have two young kids so that complicates this tremendously.  My options seem to be hold it together when I'm unhappy for the kids' sake or break up their happy home.  It's just such a shit situation to be forced into.  I've struggled with this so much that I just feel tired or dealing with it -- I need closure.

What I really want is to have the girl that I fell in love with back, but I'm fairly certain she doesn't exist anymore (and maybe never actually existed).  I think my wife is literally incapable of understanding or appreciating my needs.  I've had ""the talk"" more time than I can count.  I can't even do that anymore without a huge argument ensuing.  I'm just tired of having my needs be dismissed as unimportant or selfish.

I've seriously considered cheating or asking for an open marriage, but neither of those is really my style, nor would they be well received by my wife.  I really want someone I can share my whole life with.

In the last 6 months or so I've read nearly every post in this sub and feel everyone's pain so deeply that it actually makes me cry sometimes.  I empathize with every post I read and hate that we are in this situation.  I just want it to go away but it does not.

I've improved myself relentlessly over the past 5 years thinking it was me to blame, but it's made no difference.  No matter what I do or how hard I try there is no difference.  At this point I feel like I have tried everything.  I just feel emotionally spent at this point.  I don't know what else to do.  I know I can't continue living with this hole in my life though.

I am planning to speak to a divorce attorney this week or next.  I am not pressed for time so I plan to get all of my ducks in a row before executing anything.  I am not threatening divorce as a bargaining chip - If that's what it takes to have my needs met then I don't really want to have this relationship anymore.

If this sub is interested, I will provide bi-weekly or monthly updates.  I know this isn't my personal blog, and I don't intend it to be such - I have been searching for something detailing the divorce process first hand (particularly for this issue) but have so far not found any (side note - if anyone knows of such reading please let me know.

Thanks for reading.  I know how bad this hurts everyone who is in this situation.  I wish i could fix it for everyone but it seems like i can't even fix it for myself.  So time to give up.

tl;dr - Can't take it anymore - as painful as this is going to be I'm ending my marriage.

Edited to add - I'v received many offers of support, both in this thread and in PMs.  You have no idea how mow much it means to me to have support.  Thank you so much.

My wife and I average 1-2 times a month. Only when she wants it. When she wants it, it's always rushed, no foreplay. So, it's been almost a month since the last time we had sex. I got out of the shower and shaved before going to church. My wife came up to me and said, ""Oooh smooth face!"" and started touching me. Of course, it was right as we're leaving for church and the kids are looking right at us. She also made the comment that it's definite ""mommy &amp; daddy"" time so we would need about an hour. We get home and she needed to run to the store. She said, ""Get your penis ready for when I get back"", so of course ,I'm excited.

She gets home and nothing. She was aggravated because she couldnt find some paperwork and the kids were acting up. The day rolls on and I'm finishing up making dinner. The kids eat and my wife said, ""We're going to bed early tonight"" as in sexy times, so I agree. 

It's 8:15, kids are still up, my wife says to me, ""Ok, you got about 5 minutes so let's go."" 

I asked why only 5 minutes and she said she was tired. My wife isn't working right now, so there is really no reason for her to go to bed before 8:30pm. She didn't really have an answer so I just told her that I would wait until we have more time. She seemed ok with that. I'll probably won't have sex for another month.

What it's done to my opinion on things.,47,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/181brb/7_year_db_relationship_over_for_good_what_its/,"I haven't posted my story up before because, frankly, it's similar to a lot of other cases.  Girl and Guy with lots of sexy times, buy a place together (the stresser) and then the wheels fall off the bedroom.

But we just had ""the talk"", and not ""the talk"" that usually happens in a DB from the HL to the LL, but the other talk that doesn't always happen from the LL to the HL.  It's the ""I'm just not that into you"" talk.

Honestly, if I had looked at it outside of the dead bedroom lens that I've been looking at it with for the past few years, I would have said that she's just no longer in love.  Sure, the kisses and the hugs and my giving foot-rubs and back-rubs were there; the going further in life together, supporting each other and being excited about each others' successes were there too.  We supported one another and I thought we loved one another, and that the only issue was that we didn't have sex.

But some of that was happening out of habit; I found out she hasn't been ""happy"" for a year, which was revealed to be code for not being in love with me anymore.  We did all the same things, and she did all of the same things, out of habit and a feeling of obligation.  Finally, she went on a trip with some girls, had some time away, and she decided that it was time to have her ""talk"" with me.  It took 45 minutes and an ocean of tears, but she was out the door with my mouth on the floor.  Counselors, money fixes, working out, trying to share more interests; they all were not a possible fix she wanted to entertain.  She had made up her mind finally.

So what is my opinion now?  I feel I am close to a lot of you in a lot of ways; I've felt this for a while.  I always felt that helping fix a dead bedroom might one day bring me closer to fixing mine.  For some of you, it's simply sex that's wrong and I know that.

But for a lot of you, people like me, who blissfully cannot see the storm clouds on the horizon of the relationship.  For those who feel, like I did, that the relationship still has that loving feeling because the significant other has only pulled away physically with no explanation given.  There is another reason.  

We often discuss the need to have ""the talk"" with our SO's; that we need to open a dialogue about the needs of sex in the relationship in order for it to stay healthy.  I think another form of ""the talk"" is being avoided by a lot of the LL significant others.

1344439800.0,39,self.DeadBedrooms,xvuwq,"A Timeline of my Dead Bedroom, with the various Causes",39,0,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/xvuwq/a_timeline_of_my_dead_bedroom_with_the_various/,"I was writing this as a comment in another thread, but it got long enough I thought it deserved its own post.

We seem to have an attitude in this subreddit that ""it is what it is"", and from there most posts are about coping, cheating, and building up the courage to ""dump em already"".  I reject the premise of ""it is what it is"".  After all, I used to have a fulfilling sexual relationship.  I would think most of us here had it good at some point, otherwise we never would have gotten together with our partners in the first place.

As for the causes, the only thing that gets much traction here is:

* It's natural libido differences

* It's birth control

* You used to be more attractive


I wanted to open up more of a discussion on the causes.  After reading several books (Married Man Sex Life, Intimacy and Desire, Dating Dictionary) I started to get a more complete picture of what happened to me.  I discussed my ""sex timeline"" with my wife and we pretty much came to an agreement of how our relationship had progressed in stages.

Our dead bedroom doesn't have a single cause or two.  It's a lot of compounded causes that come and go.  Each of these stages lasted from a few months to years.  Many different causes, same effect.

1) We are first dating, in the honeymoon phase, neither of us can get enough of each other.

2) She has a close family member unexpectedly pass away.  She is very depressed (cause 1) and has 0 libido.  I'm still in the honeymoon phase.

3) I get frustrated from lack of sex, and I come off as needy to her.  She gives me just enough lousy sex to keep me around.  Sex becomes a chore for her (cause 2)

4) She gets over the loss of her family member, but is no longer attracted to me (cause 3) because I'm acting like a nerdy, needy chump.  I take the conventional relationship advice and try to be *super* nice to her, going out of my way to do everything for her, putting her on a petestal, practically friendzoning myself. (making cause 3 much worse)

5) I snap because it's not working and take it out verbally on her.  She feels unloved. (cause 4)

6) I read ""Married Man Sex Life"" and get an eye opener into the Alpha-Beta qualities of men and what women are attracted to.  The book really resonates well, I see how I used to be an Alpha male and was Betaized.  The book feels like it was written for me.  I take its advice too strictly and suddenly go back to the full on Alpha male I used to be when we first started dating.  I stop being nice to her (cause 5).  She is constantly worried of me leaving her (cause 6) and thinks I'm only sticking around until she finds a job so I'll have a better position in a divorce.  After time passes, still without sex, I'm convinced that she simply isn't attracted to me and never will be.  We stop being lovey, cuddly, etc.  I start sleeping in the other room.

7) I plan the divorce talk.  Then one day, I drop it on her.  I tell her that she isn't attracted to me and never will be, so it's pointless.  I was literally once sentence away from ""I want a divorce"" when she finally butted in and explained how she had been feeling through the last several stages.  To my surprise, she no longer found me unattractive, she found me very attractive (i was acting and dressing more attractive, had lost 25 lbs), but things were so bad between us that she couldn't possible sleep with me.  We both cry in each other's arms.

8) We start being nice to each other again.  We're in a cute, snuggly relationship again.  I start pressuring her (cause 7) into starting our sex life back up.  She gets very defensive and wants to avoid feeling pressured.  I stop asking or pressuring for sex but nothing changes.

9) I read Intimacy and Desire and it resonates very well with what's going on.  Every time we have a nice day, she feels pressure from herself into having sex (cause 8) which kills her libido.  More discussion on this stage: http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/xv88z/she_hates_the_pressure/

And that's where we find ourselves now.  Still not fixed but at least we aren't at each other's throats, we're legitimately in love again and are enjoying each others' company. It'd be easy to say ""she just has a lower libido than you"" but I think there is so much more to the picture.

Hopefully this wall of text can help someone out there.  What I wouldn't give to go back to stage 2 or 3 or 4, because after each progression things become exponentially harder to fix.  Like many problems in life, the best solution is early detection.

I'll be sure to post an update when we reach a stage 10.

Not sure if this belongs here but it seemed the most relevant sub-reddit. This has been going on for nearly 10 years. I am so hurt.


I love you. I am writing this because I love you. I hope you never have to see this because I love you. You hurt me. I love you and you hurt me, continually. You either don't know or don't care. You take advantage of me, because you know I love you. I will keep coming back to you no matter what because I hope things will change. I put up with my depression and pain because I hope you will one day realize what you are doing to me and will make it up to me. It sit in the basement and I drink and I hide myself away because you don’t give me the love I need and deserve. You shut me out so I retaliate by shutting you out.


I come home every night angry and depressed and moody because I know it will be another night of the same reserved and emotionally distant wife.


Sex; it's the biggest thing between us right now. We have it, not as often as I like, but frequency is not the biggest issue. There is a lack of emotion and intimacy in what we do. You act like it's a service you're giving me, not like you enjoy it. You may get off, but that’s only the end of a quick road. You lay there and do nothing. I want you to touch me. I want you to kiss me, to reach for my lips or pull me to you, like you can't get enough of me. I want you to cuddle afterward and tell me that you enjoyed it, that it was wonderful, that you liked that ‘little thing I did” if there was one. You lay there and do nothing, and it tells me that you're not interested in it. You tell me you want passion, but you show none of it yourself. You give me the impression that sex is a chore to you, something you have to do only if you have to. Do it and get it over with. Do it as quickly as possible so I can get on with my day or get to sleep. There is no enthusiasm from you, ever. No playfulness, no experimentation.


I have asked for blowjobs or other forms of play numerous times, and I have let it go for months at a time. No matter the suggestion or lack thereof, you don’t do it. There is no initiative from you to start anything. You tell me you want me to initiate things, and I try. I touch you, and suggest to you and make hints, but you need to give in to those touches or hints. You need to give in, and believe that it is worth it to do so. You fight me and say no.


I am clearly not allowed to touch you while you sleep to wake you up, you have made that apparent. It is somehow dirty or unwholesome to do. I can’t give your boobs a squeeze or feel you up; you don’t appreciate this. I am not allowed.


You deny me the privilege of giving you oral sex. You say it's because you don't enjoy it. You let me do it before early on in our relationship, and always then you said I had to stop because I would make you cum and you didn't want to cum that way. What changed from then to now? Were you lying to me then? What makes you uncomfortable now? I love you, and every part of you. I love looking at your most intimate area. I love touching it, with my hands and tongue as much as with my penis.


I love your breasts. I am denied those now as well. You tell me it's uncomfortable but I believe it is something else. You need to describe it in words I understand. If I can't touch them at all, how will a baby feed from them? How will you be able to stand it? Do you deny me because you believe they are just for the baby now? If so, just tell me. Stop being so vague.


I'm not allowed to touch your clitoris, that's reserved for the vibrator now. I want to use my hands or see you use yours, but it seems that it isn't good enough.


I try kissing and touching you elsewhere on your body, to feel connected to you, but you're ticklish, or uncomfortable. You don't communicate to me what you want. You don't tell me what you like so every time I try I feel like I'm doing something wrong and I get discouraged. You kill the passion in me so quickly this way. You've mostly removed me from the lovemaking I so want, so how am I supposed to show passion? Where has the trust gone? Why have you shut me out? Why are you so closed down? Am I not allowed inside to know anymore?


You say that I satisfy you and that you are satisfied, which is why you don't feel any need to do any more than that. You don't satisfy me, nor do you see a need to, so you don't try. I think that you think I should be happy with what I get. It's selfish of me to expect more. It's selfish for you to think that I don't need more because you're happy with what you get. You deny me. You make me hope. You make me think ""Maybe this time she will actually want it, want me"". It never happens. ""Maybe she will be in to it. Maybe she will need me and desire me and need me inside her. Maybe she will feel what I feel for her. My desire, my want, my need, my love.""


I am practically begging you for your attention and for your love. This begging has made you lose respect for me. You don't feel I'm worthy of your touch. You don't make the time for it. You won't put it before anything else. Only when it's convenient. Only under specific conditions. At the end of this show. If I'm not too tired. If I'm feeling ok. You will do nothing to improve those conditions. Do it before it's bed time. Do it during nap time. Record the show and come back to it later. Do you not see that I am willing to interrupt my day for you? It's not an interruption for me; it is the reason for my day, to love you. Why do you accept me saying that ""I won't bother you anymore""? It's because I feel like I am a bother, an interruption, and not something to put first before everything else. I am not worthy to you.


We did that quiz together but you have wholly dismissed it. I asked you to take it seriously and you haven't. I thought this was a way for us to open up to each other. I have sent you websites to read that express how I feel. I don’t believe you understand what I am feeling. I wrote you notes, but felt that these did nothing to improve the situation. I asked you to write me some, and the paper has sat untouched for nearly a year. I am not worth the time to write a little missive or send a text or call to tell me that you love me. You never say I love you first.


We have talked about it so many times you have become calloused and uncaring to my needs. You say you are trying and I don't see it. What are you trying? Where is the effort? Should I be seeing something I am not seeing? We had a conversation about you being less resistant to sex, but it has made no difference. Buying me food, beer, video games, these are not the way. They are small bandages over an aching heart that wants you and your touch more than anything else.


I am fragile. I need constant reassurance because you have broken me. You have made me a servant. I can’t stay this way much longer. Open up to me and share yourself with me and let me love you. Accept my love and give it back to me. How do I get you to do this? What do I need to do for you to see that you have hurt me. How do I get you to let me touch you? How do I make you see that I am worthy and that I don’t need to beg;? Why don’t you need and want me like I want you? Why do you make it seem that you do not want to change anything? Why won’t you touch me? Why won’t you love me.




EDIT: Thanks, More Details, A Discussion With My Wife (too long to append to this post, will add as a comment)




Thanks:


Loads of advice.  Thank you.  I appreciate the sympathy for those with short replies, and the time taken by those with long replies.  I must state that I am not considering leaving her.  There is significant work that can be done to make this work.  Before divorce is on the table I have to know that I've exhausted all other options such as personal counseling, couples counseling, and introspection.



More Details:


How we met.  She is the sister of a classmate of mine from College.  She was taking a program and needed a place to stay.  My classmate let me know as we were (and still are) very good friends.  I was in an apartment with another friend and we had the room so we welcomed her in.  She stayed for the summer and found a place in the apartment building across from ours.  When she moved out, we started dating.  We got together when I was 20.  She was 26.  She was my first, I was not hers.  She has never sad much about her previous relationships, but I know that I came directly after one that lasted for years.  A bad breakup I must assume, a relationship that was leading to marriage (there was talk of him thinking of proposing) and I believe he cheated.  She's never told me this, but I can guess.


At 20, I was 210 lbs, 5'10"" (I've always struggled with my weight), she was about the same (at 5'9"").  Being content, loved, things have gotten a bit worse as it's easy to let yourself go when someone accepts you for who you are.  I'm now 250 lbs.  She's gained weight because of having kids, obviously, and is now around 225.


We have two children now, one is 19 months, the other just hit 6 weeks.


We are both professionals.  She makes more money than I do.  Our combined income is good, but with her on maternity leave (we live in Canada by the way), my income and her government checks are enough to pay the bills and not much else.  My position is a contract so I couldn't take the leave if I wanted, my job is not protected.


I came from a family that struggled to put food on the table.  I felt underprivileged but I know there are many who were far worse off than I.  She grew up fairly well-to-do and is very independent.  Our attitudes clash at times, as I want to be the provider, a giver, as I feel that I was denied that safe feeling when I was growing up and want to be that kind of person because it was what I wanted.  Her independence has a difficult time accepting or giving in when she has difficulty, and comes to a head when she actually can't do something, leading to her breaking down on the rare occasion.",,False,,t5_2t25p,1376492447.0,,,True,t3_1kaday,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1kaday/m_31_believes_wife_f_37_no_longer_wants_sex_but/,

I am a 27 F with, well I don't know if I would called it a high libido but I have a healthy one, leaning more towards the higher side. He's a 30 M who in the start of the relationship, our libidos matched completely. Somewhere along the way, his has vanished. The sexual side of my relationship is very important to me and I feel like I am slowly withering away. I no longer feel like a sexual partner to him...I don't feel desired or wanted. I feel like a platonic friend who gets the occasional kiss and a couch arm-around-my-shoulder if we are watching a movie. 

We've been in the relationship for almost 3 years now and I am confused and hurt. I don't want to compare previous relationships with this one, as it's not fair, but never have I actually been pushed away at night because he was too tired. 

The other night, I tried to put on something pretty and told him I was going to bed an hour before I usually do and that I'd be waiting for him. Two hours later, he collapses into the bed and mumbles about being tired. I did my best to smile and tried rubbing his back; but inside I was breaking again. Rather than come to bed two hours before, he'd rather sit on the computer and play that stupid card game again. He shoved my hands away and told me to stop it, that he just wanted to sleep. 

I have been told 'I just want to sleep' for the last year. I don't understand why the computer screen time is more important than together time. I am being slowly shattered inside and I am realizing that I can't take much more of this. 

I love him but I need to be loved back. How do you deal with a dead bedroom? I have never been in this situation and I am not sure I want to stay for my own sanity.

I've been reflecting upon the deadBedroom situation over the past years and I wondered if any gents or ladies would care to pontificate upon the anatomy of a dead bedroom. 

How does a functioning relationship become a dead bedroom ? And how do so many of us find ourselves in one without ever seeing it coming. ?And why do some people stay in miserable situations even though they have no hope. I don't speak of people who are in a db because of an illness. I mean those who are married to a fully capable adult who simply chooses to not have sex with their spouse. People have all sorts of excuses but if they wanted to they would. 

Does anyone else notice personality changes after being in a db for extended time?

I myself noticed that after being in a dead bedroom for 7.5 years it changed my personality. After speaking to someone else who observed similar changes. I'm much more cynical now. I am less patient. I've become a porn addict , a pleasure seeker , and I am noncommittal.  I am incredibly sarcastic. 

I view bad sex or a lack of sex ( except for physical illness situations) as justification for breaking up whereas in the past I would have tried to teach or fix things. 

I no longer do things just for the sake of niceness ( massage , oral sex, special meals.  ). I don't do them at all if they won't be reciprocated or wildly appreciated at least. For years I massaged my husband ( at a vigorous professional level -deep tissue transcendental massage  not a half assed attempt) for 1-2 hours every day and I never got one in return.  Not even a foot rub. Not once . Somehow I thought being super nice and sweet would inspire sex but it just left me feeling used in some way. Like an unpaid employee. Err it's not like any other part of our relationship was pleasant. We weren't friends. He was more like a disapproving lord and master. 

I view marriage through a darkened  lens now. I see happy couples who are courting but not married and I envy them immensely. 

 I see people who are married for 20 years or more and I see an underlying level of disappointment and complacency. Perhaps a smattering of resentment. Resigned to their fate.  but no one dares speak about it. They say they are happily married but I'm not sure who they are trying to convince. Me or themselves. 

Don't get me wrong. There are some people who are genuinely happy together. But I have only met a handful who seemed genuine. Most just parrot the words. 

In the past people stayed together for life because they had no other option. Societal expectations. Religious gobbledygook. Fear of change. Not wanting to downsize. Financial stuff. 
In this day and age we are not tethered by that sort of thing.   We have choices. Some choose to be unhappy. But why? 

Coming from someone whose parents stayed together ""for the kids"" even though they were miserable I can definitely say that this isn't the 1950s and my life would have been much happier if they had divorced. Other redditors say the same kind of things. I'm sure it affected my sense of self worth watching my mother throw away a large portion of her life In a clearly unhappy situation witg no affection between parents until she finally couldn't take anymore and abandoned the kids. Leaving me to take care of younger siblings. Anything would have been better than that

*************

We had our 9 year anniversary yesterday. I feel like I went all out. I booked couples massages at the swanky Waikiki spa. Then it was torchlight dinner on the sand in the North Shore. 

I bought her, among other things, an ornate bustierre. She got me a Tshirt from the gift shop that was two sizes too big. When I told her that it was huge and I couldn't wear it, she took it back. Then she got mad at me for not pretending to like it. 

We fought much of the day, but I felt like it got turned around by dinner. We had a lovely evening. But as soon as we got to the hotel room, it was into sweat pants and reading a Jane Austen novel.

My husband and I are trying now to work our way through a DB that was caused probably/mostly/almost for sure by me.  

Married for 9 years, have a child together, and had a DB for 5 years.  After we had our child I felt overwhelmed with everything.  I felt that everything was dumped on me to do and after a while I did start to resent that.  But I also see how I took over doing everything.  There was a lot I wouldn't let him help me with. We also went through some financial bad times that I blamed solely on him and his failed business venture. So in my mind, everything bad that I was feeling was his fault and I shut down.

A couple of months ago I found out that he had been having sex-chatting/emailing exchanges with women he met here on Reddit.  They shared pics and chats and masturbated together. He was even to the point of possibly meeting one of these women for something extra. I found this all out after asking to see his phone.  I knew for a few months he had had some Alien Blue app on his phone that had a passcode on it.  That set off a flag for me but when I asked him about it, I didn't dwell on it too much at the time.  I just filed it away. Then one night I just asked to see his phone and he flip-flopped about it for awhile.  Then he finally handed it to me and I found 2 email accounts and these pictures.  Needless to say I was devastated.  He told me from Day 1 that he would never cheat, never leave.  I relied on that to our detriment really.  No matter how many times we'd fight over our lack of intimacy and how many times he would hint that he might go elsewhere, I just kept on relying on the fact that he would never cheat or leave so I wouldn't have to listen to him.  I thought it was all just a bluff.

I will say that for a few of weeks before finding all of this out, I had started to realize my fault in our relationship and understanding how I needed to make changes in my way of thinking towards him and towards myself.  I got to a point where I just hated myself as well.  I hated the way I looked, felt, everything.  But I started trying to change the way I thought about myself and him and had started to work on things within myself emotionally.  I hadn't really acted on things with him yet at the time but I was realizing that not everything was his fault and that I wanted to try and find the couple we used to be.  

After finding out about my husband's online activity, we have spent a lot of time talking.  A LOT.  More than he ever wanted probably.  LOL  We hash everything out.  I am able to ask anything and he answers.  It wasn't always easy to hear but we went through it.  We started having sex again and rediscovering our intimacy together.  We've shared so many thoughts and acts and just are falling in love with each other again.  We are even starting to find things we want to do together which was something I never had any interest in doing before.

My husband has his faults and what he did was wrong, but I do see my part in it all.  He would flat out say to me ""I need to feel that you want me and if you won't, I might have to find someone that will"".  I know that is a jerk thing to say to someone but me looking him straight in the face and saying ""please go, do it and leave me alone"" is also a jerk thing to say to someone.  And I did that.  Several times I did that.  

We both did things that got us to that point.  Maybe I wouldn't have handled it the way he did but I didn't handle it at all.

We aren't 100% fixed. I still have some days where I am not interested at all in sex or being intimate, or even acting lovingly toward him.  I have days where I wake up hating myself and taking it out on everyone and everything around me.  But I have had fewer and fewer of those days thankfully. When I do have those days, I try to tell him about it. It's hard for me to do that though so I am working on it.  We text and call each other during the day, we go to bed at the same time now, we talk about things we stopped sharing with each other.  I do have trust issues with him now. When I get worried or freaked out, I talk to him about it. So my advice to anyone that is going through this is don't stop talking.  I don't know if it will always help.  I know if I hadn't begun to realize the problem and start to through it myself before I discovered these things he had been doing, I have no idea if my reaction would have been the same. I doubt it would have. I probably would have been out the door in a second and everything would still be completely his fault, or that's what I'd tell myself.  So just keep trying to talk to your SO about how you feel. It might not work in all circumstances but maybe it will.  I don't mind answering any questions you all have because I do realize I've probably rambled on here.

EDIT:  I got my SO to read this all last night.  He asked me why I made it sound like it was all my fault all of this happened.  I didn't really have an answer for that. Maybe again I am putting more on myself than I should. Maybe I am falling back to allowing my brain to only think negatively about myself. Again, I don't know.

I've been in a long-term relationship (10+ years) which on the outer surface appears great, and all other aspects of our relationship are compatible.

We just... don't have sex. I'm lucky if he even gropes my ass. He *used* to love my ass. I guess not any more. I could parade around in the finest undergarments and he wouldn't give a fuck. I HAVE paraded around in my undergarments and he didn't give a fuck. I know people will tell me that's too subtle, but I am terrified of rejection. It hurts me to my core. The other day I worked up the nerve to send him pics of myself in a new bra. What a fucking fool I was. The reaction was... oh, that's nice.

That night I drank, cried and punched myself in the stomach until I bruised my knuckles and I stopped crying. The next morning, he calls me while I'm at work, and asks why I was acting like ""my dog had died"" after he had gone to bed (He has to go to bed fucking EARLY for work, I'm talking 8 PM early), and what was I supposed to tell him, at work? Shout out in earshot of my co-workers that ""YOU NEVER WANT TO FUCK ME, how about that?""

I'm so ashamed. I'm a failure of a woman. I'm used up, invisible. It doesn't matter that I work out, do hundreds of squats in hopes of achieving a perfect ass. He'll never touch it. Nobody will. It's not like I've ""let myself go"" or anything. I'm just... man-repellant. 

I have other issues, obviously. I have almost crippling social anxiety and trust issues. I was abused when I was young (I don't remember all the details and I'd rather not) and raped when I was 14. Come to think of it, when the SO found out about my rape was around the time he stopped touching me. He didn't find out about it from me, my fucking MOTHER told him, for, I don't know, drama reasons? She couldn't let sleeping dogs lie, could she? Before you ask, I've been in therapy and I'm on several meds. There's not a lot to be done with my broken ass.

This weekend I tried, and I just couldn't. I'll never be the agressive seductress. I don't know how. I feel foolish trying. I always have. Like I'll be laughed at. The only thing I can hope for is that he'll get drunk enough to hit on me, but that almost never happens because he hardly ever drinks past one beer any more.

At this point, when I think of spending the rest of my life never experiencing another person's desire, never knowing what it's like to be lusted after, I kind of want to die.

**TL;DR**: In a long-term, now sexless relationship. Could strut in naked, boyfriend wouldn't care. I have past trauma, but I've tried to not let it affect my sex drive. Boyfriend has not been agressive with me since he learn I was raped as a kid. I am invisible. I am man-repellant. I am a failure of a woman.

I feel like I am at the end of my rope. I don't know how to deal with her anxiety any longer. It's always about her anxiety and how I can't even lay a hand on her. Has not even initiated so much as a hug in years. I have gotten to the point where now I can't even orgasm when the moons align and we do have sex (This just started happening).

I don't know what to do or who to talk to..
I am so frustrated. I love her but why doesn't she see or care how much this hurts. FUCK.
I have taken as much of the stress away from her life that I can because she asked me to, and the ONE SINGLE FUCKING THING that I ask she can't do. She won't even try. It's not even about the sex, it's about not being rejected when I reach for her hand. Or the depression that comes when she rolls her eyes at me for trying to hug her. 
I don't know what I'm asking for. I just wanted to vent.Fuck this, fuck me. I'll probably delete this in an hour.

What I WANT to happen: 

To be allowed to kiss his body absolutely all over, to be kissed all over, to make out deeply and passionately without fear of him stopping after 20 seconds, to have him fondle my breasts from behind with real desire, to handjob him and see his cum, to masturbate in front of him, to hold each other for ages in bliss without him reading a magazine or his Kindle, etc etc etc 

What REALLY happens: 

I nearly orgasm from cheek kisses (!) 

I try to make out with him but he isn't much into that; 

 I am allowed to give him a blowjob (which I love) after I initiate it; he's very into getting it, cums and then gets up and puts his trousers back on immediately and gets up; 

I lie in bed, tearful, listening to the sounds of him moving around the flat and dreaming of passionate, dirty sex :( 


...I really love to give blowjobs without expecting return favours, but it's been weeks and I feel rejected as a woman :( I haven't counted times, but it really isn't often that we have anything besides blowjobs and his rubbing me, or the occasional quickie. 

Over the past 2 to 3 years, I feel he hasn't been really interested in vaginal sex but mainly blowjobs and anal. I haven't been able to conceive, for obvious reasons, and feel resentful because of that (we did decide to try for a child, in fact) I never felt insecure sexually before, but begin to lose self-confidence, not only in the bedroom but in normal life as well, and wonder if I am too fat (I may have 10kg extra?) or that my pussy is too wide (I haven't even given birth, never got the chance). 

I myself feel beautiful and attractive, I like the way I look, I know other men do too, and I burn for him to just abandon all thought and indulge in pleasure with me.

Update,45,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/16lgv3/ive_been_patient_since_november_tonight_i_make_a/,"Saturday evening after dinner I start moving furniture.  She asks what I'm doing.  I push play on the cd player I dug up from storage and our song starts playing.  I don't remember the last time we played it, but it's on cd so that should give some indication.  I told her I missed her so much during the last couple months and that I don't want to live like this anymore.  I told her it would mean so much to me if she would dance with me like old times.  She burst into tears and hid in the bedroom.  I tried talking to her but she would just scream at me to leave her alone between sobs.  Same thing Sunday.

Today, I tried talking again but didn't leave her when she shouted at me.  I'll be honest: I cornered her and demanded she tell me what's going though her mind.  Well, it turns out she's in love with her personal trainer and is still unsure about our future.  Apparently communicating this to me never crossed her mind and she was perfectly happy to let me believe everything was going well.

I understand how this happened.  I've been distant lately and she's been spending one on one time with a man who pays close attention encourages her to feel good about herself.  It's no surprise she would develop a crush on him.

I gave her until the end of the week to decide what she wants to do about us.  If she want's to stay with me she needs to get a female trainer and go to counselling with me.  If she sees him again or refuses counselling, I'm gone.

I already have an appointment for this Friday and I've talked with a friend about staying at his place while I find an apartment, so either way I have a plan.

1352782507.0,36,self.DeadBedrooms,133vo9,[update] What I did about my dead bedroom,48,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/133vo9/update_what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/,"Update on [this post...](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/102ah8/what_i_did_about_my_dead_bedroom/)

So May 24th was the day that my wife and I call our 'divine intervention' day, it was the day we had the talk. The talk was really the first time after 3 or so years of very dead bedroom and 7 years before that of new babies related coma bedroom. (And before that, about 15 years of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" kind of sex life - the beginning of the movie, not the middle or the end...) Just by chance I'm a non-confrontational person, and I think it matters that I hadn't turned the sex issue into a battle ground.

So things are still going well, and that's a big relief for me. Over the summer we both agreed that the start of the school year would be the real test of how our relationship had changed. In her mind, it was when the real stress would return to our lives - the kids in school, her working again, the busy pace of the holidays, plus she has a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder (the gloom). Stress has always lead her away from the bed. My additional concern was that we were simply in the 'honeymoon phase' of a relationship 'renewed' over the summer, and when that faded, where would we be?

But as it turns out, we are doing really well. The sex isn't as frequent as in the summer. For those of you who want numbers, its more like 2 or 4 times a week instead of 4 or more. It's less, but I feel like it's just a realistic pace for this part of our lives rather than a Bad Sign. We have to wait for the kids to get into bed and she has some days where she works nights etc etc, but maybe it makes more sense to explain why I feel like she really '*gets it*'.

She initiates a ton, perhaps most of the time, while I try to focus on maintaining an on-going physical/sexual 'contact'. In the beginning, when we were talking about what I needed from the relationship, I said how I'd like our physical connection to be woven into our lives the way our emotional connection was and she said that sounded perfect (to my surprise, quite honestly - I thought I'd have to sell it). I thought constant contact was important because I think she experiences responsive desire, so she'd need something to 'respond to' if we were going to have a sex life, but it couldn't be a 'here I am behaving in the I_want_sex way to get in your pants in 15 minutes' it had to be 'this is how I/we always behave' - both with physical connection and with emotional connection. A big part of making that work, I think, is knowing when is the wrong time to act physical. So I focus more on long hugs throughout the day (always a safe bet), noticing her (her new clothes, hair cut), occasionally some playful/sexual touching when the time is right (which she does also), occasional 'thinking of last night, still smiling' kind of text messages (trying to consider before I send it where she'll be when she reads it).

But beyond that, I make the emotional connection she needs to feel right about the physical connection, so I fairly often leave her notes in the morning before she wakes up (I notice these don't get read and thrown away, they stay around for a while), I make her coffee (I don't drink coffee, so it's something just for her) and other ""Acts of Service"" that show love (if you are 5lovelanguages person, she's ""words of affimation"" and ""acts of service""). These aren't difficult chores, they are things that are about her and a way of showing I'm thinking of her. I make the bed now after a decade of sort of stubbornly refusing to grow up about it and accept that adults make their bed even though they will just unmake it at night - a daily symbol that I've grown up, that I'm part of the relationship now. (For the 'alpha' people, we have three kids, a full time job and a part time job, a dog and a cat. There's no such thing as trading free time for chores, it's 24/7 chores, just which ones are the priority. I'm going to be working all day long on laundry or whatever, but I make a point to do a few things that are me telling her ""hey sweetie, thinking of you"".) So in that sense I'm initiating all the time, but hours or days before we actually get sexy, and usually she's the one that closes the bedroom door and lights the candles. She's also gotten very considerate to think about telling me things like when she expects her period to start, when she knows early in the night that she's going to crash out as soon as possible, etc.

Probably the most surprising night was after celebrating my mom's birthday at our house with my brother and his wife as well as my mom. Kind of a big deal, my bro and sis-in-law are sort of 'entertainers' with high standards and *usually* do the entertaining, so we were sort of 'on stage' all night. Stressful, right? But before bed that night, after the kids were asleep and the kitchen clean, we were hanging out on the deck having a drink to unwind (which before we'd have just gone our separate ways to unwind) and we wind up in bed with actual recreational sex rather than sort of 'regular' sex.

I feel good because I see her exploring a small bit out of her comfort zone for me and our sex life, and liking it. She's always been insecure about sex - doesn't 'want' oral often even though she likes it, she's a lights off sex girl, more inclined to grind and stick it in than have a big long touch-full 'session'. But we'll sometimes have longer sessions, and she shares her body more with me than before. She trusts me to respect her boudaries and she trusts me enough to move her boundaries a little bit (when she's up for it). And I think part of it too is that I'm getting better - communication helps a lot with that. So as much as I enjoy the new things we try, I don't push, I communicate how much I appreciate them and make sure she's happy with the way things are going also.

Trust is a big part of why this is working. Not just her trusting me, but I trust her that she means it. She's committed to making the physical side of the relationship work for me and to try and expand her boundaries because she knows that sex doesn't feel right to me when it's all 'closed in'. She trusts me, even though she doesn't share the sentiment, when I say that I like some new experiences in the bed room the way she likes to re-arrange the furniture. And honestly, she's had an open mind about it, and she's enjoying sex more than she used to. She really feels like the physical connection is a good part of our relationship that she wants to keep - not because of what comes with it, but for it's own sake.

Am I being 'alpha'? I'm not being 'cave man' alpha - I'm not ordering her around or 'dominating' her or trying to get other women interested. (I have been meaning to get a better idea of what married man sex life is about but haven't had a chance yet.) But I am making her feel safe and I am 'present' in the relationship now, and I make sure she's getting what she needs. Sometimes that's a problem solved, sometimes that's emotional support, sometimes that being honest about what I want - being 'all in' with the relationship. I used to be a 'whatever you want, no problem' guy, trusting her to read my mind or to have some magical ability to read my mind and 'just know' if something would be a bigger sacrifice for her or for me. It was a big deal when I told her I wanted to change the way we were having sex, that I felt closed out of it, and it was communication that lasted for a week. I worried that I was walking back the substansive progress we had made over sort of 'style' issues, but also felt like it was The Right Thing To Do - its both of us in bed, not just her. I was all in, and that meant that I needed to tell her what I wanted. And we worked through it. And she understands that a little variety is important to me, and touching her is important to me. And we're working on that, and things are moving forward at the pace they need to. And there are other things in the relationship that I'd like to change (non-physical stuff, household stuff) that I have let be because I don't know of any constructive way to address them. But in all honestly, I find that issues that used to result in sort of stand offs we tend to collaborate much better on.

It has been a slow process, but as I've realized that it is moving forward and that I can trust her, it's easier to go slow. And slow is how it has to be, that's respecting her boundaries.

We've both had experiences where we felt like things were 'going back' to how they were. One example, we had a special weekend we had planned to get away, 3 days 2 nights, but then the kids and calendar got in the way and it was soon one night, then as little as a 12 hour trip. It was OK, but the 'before' me would be very very angry at the way things were scaled back, even though it was, in all fairness, unavoidable. I had done a TON of planning for fun sexy things AND for her type of things - restaurants she wanted to get to, planning a hike, a surprise dessert I was going to make her, but there would be little to no time for those things in the end. And while we were out that night, I started feeling bad, and it wasn't long before we had to get back early - stomache flu, barfing from midnight to 6am, then it was time to go home. I spent the next 24 hours recovering, and while I was getting better, I wanted to be alone. I'm a man, right, I don't want help... And she told me later that it was a bad feeling for her, a reminder of before, and when I was driving home (I stayed behind to recouperate a bit) I was feeling that old distance between us. Not the anger, just remote. I've even had nights where I missed my old routine. That was a couple months ago, and its passed. We both try to be careful about sending the 'old vibes'.

So I hope this is helpful, I think updates are interesting, and I think it's good to hear that sometimes things work out.

I only found the DB sub-reddit a few months ago but like others I have been fascinated by the stark similarity in stories.  It seems like such a solid pattern for all those affected, at least in the general descriptions of the symptoms.  Deadbedrooms are just that, symptoms of a larger problem(s).  It is such a slow spiral to the bottom that you look back and wonder how it got to this. 

At this point I have moved on, I filed for divorce 3 weeks ago and I am completely at ease with the decision.  I did everything I could and feel confident that there was not anything that I missed in my attempts that would have been the key to resolution. Multiple self-help books, dedicated self improvement, counseling, etc.. I still have pieces of lingering self-doubt about myself but I can deal with those points now without tying it back to her.  Her issues should have been obvious but it took me years to realize/acknowledge/accept them in full.  I do a very good job of not focusing on her faults (at this point) but I am going to list them out here for the sake of others that are trying to work through their own issues as I failed to accept these for long time:

* Bad upbringing - her parents never showed her any affection as a child. They are not evil people but they just did not show love and affection towards each other or her, basically crappy parents and a bad example.  I list this at the top because I think everything flows from this through her life.  And this is strange I think because if you meet them they seem normal except for this lack of affection to their children.  She never experienced a loving/giving relationship as a child.  She does not know what a good relationship looks like. In fact this will be her second divorce.  The kicker for me on this is ""what example am I showing my own two daughters by staying in this relationship? Am I guilty of the same?""

* Alcoholism - she has been an alcoholic since the day I met her.  Now steadfastly sober for 19 months it is still part of her personality.  Al-Anon helped me tremendously in coping with this, I should have gone many years ago.  While I am happy that she is sober and it eases my mind in leaving her with that fixed, getting her sober is the likely cause for what broke this relationship.  My insistence that she sober up, discovering her caches of wine in all the various places, trying to control her drinking with ultamatims and such broke her respect/trust of me.  I was honestly trying to save her life but all she could focus on was that I was controlling her.  Here is the thing, once they are sober, all of those characteristics and behaviors are still there, they just lack alcohol at that point.  I certainly lost respect for her during the course of this.  Substance abuse kills relationships, no doubt.
  
* Depression and anti-depressants - as a happy optimist I had a hard time understanding the depths of this, furthermore the medication may have killed what little desire she had.  Her emotions now are flat on meds, no ups no downs, she has not shed a tear since I filed for divorce.  Just no reactions at all.

* Sleeps all day in any situation - she has untreated sleep apnea.  Yes we bought a CPAP machine, she will not use it.  This was one of the last straws for me.  She was unwilling to tackle this medical issue that could have eliminated some of her other issues.

* Diagnosed Cognitive Deficit - she lacks the full ability to make logical decisions that are in her best interest.  Cleared a little from getting sober, still shocks my kids on some of the things she decides.  Neurologist thinks it is related to sleep apnea and drinking history, will probably never know.

* Spends all free time watching TV or shopping - moved aggressively into this after stopping drinking

The bedroom story is so typical that I can breeze through it.  Good normal sex while dating and early in marriage, while she was ""responsive desire"" she was open to it most of the time and always enjoyed sex once it started. Then kids show up, frequency drops, deal with it for years.  Pattern ensues, no regular affection, sex only once a week, foreplay from her dissapears, duty sex(""let's get this over with""), regular rejection begins to really hit me, she calls me a sex addict, The Talk, counseling, finally tells me ""have not loved you in a long time"", Divorce.

The bottom line is RESPECT.  If she loses respect for you for some reason or you lose respect for her for some reason it will begin a cycle of disrespect in both directions that spirals for years.  I think it is rare that a couple can break out of this.  Sadly I think I was the first one to lose respect for her because of the drinking, that's what I have to work on as I move through life at this point.  I have to be conscious of my reactions to new potential partner's own lifepath and accept it or move on.

In the end you have to take ownership of yourself for yourself.  You have to set realistic timelines and acknowledge those when you reach them, quit dragging it out.  What helped me was Al-Anon, opening up to a good friend and family, getting counseling for myself(not the marriage), and investing time in myself by getting fit with running and diet.  A relationship can only work if both individuals have wholehearted independent lives which the other recognizes and respects.  That respect you have for how your partner carries on in their individual life is what binds you together as a solid couple.

The deadbedroom is a symptom of your relationship as a whole.  Without respect, intimacy and physical closeness are not possible.  So try everything people in here suggest that is based on improving yourself to raise respect, but recognize that it might not work and you may need to move on in the end.  If you are about to cheat or ask for an open marriage then my personal opinion is that you likely have passed the end of this relationship but refuse to acknowledge it.  Do you think she will respect that suggestion and come around to it at some point or that your children will respect that choice compared to divorcing?  Will your possible future partner respect the path you took?  Lastly will you respect yourself?  I looked at cheating as just one of the ways I could have brought the marriage to a close, so I just went ahead and closed it down, I did not see the eventual pain of having that discovered as worth it.

* Don't lose respect for your partner and yourself
* Read ""Sex Starved Marriage"" and ""Five Love Languagues"" and put true effort into it
* Get fit
* Have a social life
* Get personal counseling
* Open up to close friend/family that you trust has good judgement
* Don't cheat
* Get marriage counseling
* GTFO once you pass your line in the sand

I'm not, by any means condoning getting sex outside of the relationship, I just don't see that it's any different from denying sex or failing to maintain sex as a priority in a relationship.

Secret to female orgasms included, lol.",46,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1fyfat/long_letter_to_my_intimacyfearing_husband_maybe/,"Lots of background that I won't go into, needless to say we have trust issues that I'm trying to get him to help us with. Not everyone will be able to relate to these dead-bedroom causes but maybe someone will.

[[[Keep in mind that it's just a letter to my husband, I wasn't trying to be politically correct with all my generalizations. I'm sure there are lots of women who are different to me. Doesn't change the fact that there's way more porn than education on actual female sexuality, so I'm just trying to hammer home the fact that we're built differently.]]]

---------

I was thinking about when I start going to work all day and I know there is absolutely no way you're just not going to look at porn, and I doubt you'd be very inclined to tell me. I get it, it's easier, and you think you're helping the situation by causing less drama or something. I can understand how difficult it is to risk putting yourself into a line of fire when you yourself believe what you are doing is completely harmless. 

So firstly, I just need to remind you how it's harming us. Think of it this way- in sex, men seem to love the orgasm more than anything. But the real female orgasm comes from the psychological thrill of deep emotional connection- which is why I can survive so long on just giving you blowjobs. It's not perfect, since I never feel like you care about reciprocating the same back- but I can fantasize that you desire me for that brief moment. I don't just get aroused psychologically, my true orgasm is psychological. You, are my orgasm. This is why the 'you can finish yourself off' line you used to give me completely shuts down everything- not only do I not get my mental orgasm, but that line shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how I function. Listen to your wife, and not the porn- I do not need my clit pounded in just the right way until some pressure builds up. All I need is to feel like my protector actually wants to put his penis in me. Honestly, if there's performance anxiety I don't understand because desire is all the technique you'll ever need, and that desire is what you throw away. 

Feeling genuinely sexually desired is the ultimate activator of sex drive for me. We just need to work on cultivating your desire for me, and then showing that to me. I just have a feeling that if you can cultivate desire for me and not just orgasms, then I can feel actually aroused, and then you'll feel a lot more comfortable with me if I am libidinous rather than just sad and wishful.  

Every time you watch porn, you're spending your sexual energy and bonding chemicals on images of other naked people- images that will stay in your mind, associated with those chemicals, long after you close them. After this year and a half of you choosing to do that over building intimacy with me, I already am unsure of whether or not it's possible to repair the distance I now feel. I can always feel when you have been depleted of that energy, I know when you have nothing left to give me. 

 So that's why spending your energy elsewhere is harmful- it directly denies me my greatest pleasure, my orgasm equivalent. Every time you do it in secret, I am pushed further away. Try to keep that in mind. 

This isn't our core problem, the conglomeration of them all is why I'm being so serious. Because I moved across the world to be with you, I can't just leave for a while so that you know how seriously hurt I am, like many women have to do. I just hope you can fight with me to keep us together before I am too full of pain to stay. Damage to my esteem and vulnerability has already been done after all the rejection, I honestly can't imagine starting to get intimate again, all of this sounds really hypothetical. So please bear that in mind.

As you know, I'm fine with porn once we're able to establish complete trust- but I need you to actually help me.  

So while I still expect you to at least try to refrain most of the time (since you aren't ready to be able to talk to me about it openly), I know there will be times when the urge is too strong. I think the pain of you getting what you want at the expense of what I want will be lessened if each time you succumb to it, afterwards you pick one thing to do for our relationship. I know you hate vagueness so solid examples of something to do would be:

- Take a pre-decided amount of time out of playing video games to read an email I've sent you. 
- Take a pre-decided amount of time out of playing video games to think about our relationship, what you really want, your life and happiness, or how you could communicate with me better, or how important it is for you to learn to be less angry, etc etc. You don't have to relay anything if you don't want, so long as you know you've made some progress.
- Plan a date for us, anything ranging from just clearing the table and baking something nice to a fun outdoor activity we could do together, keeping in mind that I'd find anything, even going to the shooting range, extremely fun if I knew you simply wanted to spend time with me. 
- Just come up with something random to do with me that would make either of us feel closer. Maybe starting to build a tiny herb garden or experimenting with homemade pizzas. I thrive on spontaneous projects with my partner, which is why I'm on empty a lot of the time.
- Do something active about your fear of intimacy- take a risk and talk to me about it. Think about why it's stressful and try to explain it to me. It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense the first few tries, so long as you give it a little go. You always complain that I don't 'see you'- please understand that that is because you need to put aside the keyboard and put some time into thinking, articulating and sharing. I really want nothing more than to understand you (just remember, that strengthens my connection orgasm, so why wouldn't I want that?) Denying me understanding is convenient for your tendency to need to believe that 'I don't care' when you get self-protective, and it's not fair. I know you are avoidant but please think about how self-fulfilling that is. Once you feel more trusting of me, expressing yourself will get easier. Maybe one day you could send me something like this document, telling me how I can help you trust me. (Yelling bits and pieces during an outburst is unfortunately not effective, since my security system designed to protect my small female body in the face of a big out-of-control male has gone off and you won't get to see my empathy until it's deactivated.) 


If any of this is not what you want out of life, then I will understand. Truly. We can be very different people, and I want us both to be happy. None of these things are demands, just guidance in case you decide you want me around. I would love for you to tell me what you need too, if you do decide that.

1370179202.0,38,self.DeadBedrooms,1fimwe,As suspected,43,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1fimwe/as_suspected/,"I wrote a week ago or so how my wife was actually interested for her once a month encounter and how I was resentful that she controlled all intimacy in the relationship and that outside of this couple day window once a month where she wants it, everything is forced and annoying to her.  Anyway, so we had sex and it was okay, but quick and the same as always and she scratched that itch.  As predicted, immediately after that all affection and intimacy is gone.  She doesn't need to touch or be touched by me now.  Maybe 3 weeks from now she'll be up for it again.

I know she can't control her sexuality and it is what it is.  It's always been that way.  If you see my other posts you'll know that I've been addressing this for years now and nothing changes.  We either wait for the stars to align and have our 10-20 minute session once a month (thinking of it that way is depressing), or we try and force it and schedule it and whatever else and it just leads to resentment and fighting.  We just aren't compatible that way and never have been.

Her getting in the mood once a month and only needing a quick session actually makes me feel worse.  It's like she has no real desire for me outside of that window and even then it feels like any guy would do at that time.  I feel so unwanted, rejected, undesired.  I feel like I've never attracted a woman in a real way and it's giving me a complex.  I'm changing myself in every way I can think of to be as attractive as possible.  Sometimes I think it's working based on the reaction of other women (was openly hit on by a stranger recently for the first time in my life), but not her.  I am utterly unable to attract her no matter what I do.  It's just not important to her.  There are no structural, trust, other issues to address.  It just is what it is.

I can't see doing anything about it except basically just continuing on in the life *I* chose by marrying a low libido woman.  We have children and I just can't see doing anything else but sucking it up, even though I've felt like I've lived with a roommate for years.  It's destroyed the bond I once felt for her.  I think she's very happy and content with the sexless/emotionless arrangement we have, but to me it's destroyed any connection we had that I was trying to salvage these years.  I haven't 'checked out' so to speak as I'm still actively engaged in the family.  I don't ignore her and I'm not passive aggressive.  I just don't feel that much towards her romantically anymore.  Her lack of interest has killed mine.  I'm not even interested in sex with her anymore because there is no real emotion involved, just like the rest of our relationship.  We are so utterly incompatible in what we need out of a relationship.  I don't know how she is so content with our roommate agreement where my feelings and need for intimacy is more of an annoyance than anything.  Similarly, I don't think she understands why I would want passion.  It's not just sex, but overall intimacy and emotional connection.  No, I don't want to pour my feelings out to her every day and I know that you can't be needy in a relationship, especially as a man, but I would like some desire.  Ya, I want to feel like the king of her world.  Like that all I do is appreciated and she cares about my feelings and wants to be there for me.  I want her to spontaneously want to be interested in me sometimes.  Or, even if she has a reactive drive, to have that drive actually respond in a real way and not just out of obligation as a chore to be finished as quickly as possible and only as often as she deems necessary.  It feels sterile and disconnected to me.  I don't think I can change this aspect of me.  I need that intimacy in a relationship and she doesn't.  I don't think we'll ever change each other and I don't see how that works long term.

It doesn't provide me with a solution, but it's how I feel about it and I just sometimes need to write it out and reflect over all of it.  Maybe the type of relationship I envision is impossible and this is how relationships play out.  Maybe it's pointless to go searching for another one ever as my expectations will always lead to disappointment.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1fimwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1fimwe/as_suspected/,
1367886500.0,33,self.DeadBedrooms,1dtv90,Update: Last night was pretty bad &lt;rant&gt;,42,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1dtv90/update_last_night_was_pretty_bad_rant/,"First: thank you all to those who took the time to post in my rant thread.

Things have progressed, and I think it is worth it to describe a bit of it.  About 24 hours after posting we had a ""Talk"" in a quiet bar.  She obviously felt trapped when I suddenly announced: ""We have to talk"".  I expressed to her that I felt like we were roommates and that I was resenting her for not even touching me.  I used a sentence that I have used in other Talks: ""You treat me worse than you treat your friends"". I think she got it, but she's gotten it before and slowly let the attitude creap back in.

[Sidebar: That's what I think is the most depressing thing out of this whole DB experience; you both have a talk, clear the air, things are promised, you really feel like you've taken a great step forward, only to realize 6 months later that things have slowly crawled right back to exactly the way it was... Rinse, repeat...  Where do you draw the line ?]

So, anyway, the discussion become teary for both of us, and she suddenly says: ""If you want me to stay home and just take care of you and I can't go anywhere and see anyone, then this won't work, because I am never going through that again!""  ...W-T-F...   There is nothing in our past that I can think of where this sentence is even applicable.  I didn't say that to her.  I just assured her that I meant nothing like that, and quite the opposite in fact.  I know that when she interacts with other people and goes out (with or without me) and mingles with a group, she comes back home rejuvinated, and happy.  We make it a point of each having at least one night per week free from the kids and each other.

[Another great sentence she threw at the very beginning of the conversation was: ""Why can't you just 'live'? Why do you have to stress about this?""]

At the end of the conversation, I keep repeating ""we have to keep talking about our relationship, please promise we will keep talking about our relationship...""  She agreed.  It's been 19 days. Nothing.

BUT, she has started being human again: she demonstrates some affection, kisses me when she gets back from work, kisses me goodnight, a few hugs thrown in.  I like it.  Still no sex, but baby steps.  Remember that my main rant was the -touching- part.

So, she's making an effort.  Meanwhile, I find that in some days, I am still as resentful as before.  I don't really like that in myself because she is making an effort and I should mentally reward that.  Well, a week ago, I see an ebook called **Coming Home to Passion** by Ruth Cohn.  I read through it, and come to terms with the basis of the book which is that any sexual problem in the couple is 50-50.  So, I start thinking back on my childhood and realize a bit more **why** ""I stress about it"".  It is partly the sex, and partly the touching, but mostly the rejections that frost my shorts.  Realizing this, I understand a bit more why I am still resentful even when she is making an effort.  I see opportunities where sex could happen and because she doesn't detect them or take advantage of them, I see all of those as rejections, and the resentment begins anew.

That's my own problem to solve, but again, 50-50; so she has her own problems to solve.  

I need her to flirt with me. I need her to tease me in the daytime.  I need her to tell me what she likes in our sexuality.  I need her to take her time when we have sex.  I need to feel like she is looking forward to sex, not just react to it.  I need to please her.  I need to feel desired. I need to feel like I have a sex life, and that I have more than 20 days of sex left in front of me until I leave this planet.

That's an awful lot of ""I"".  And that's the gist of it: realizing that mariage is being a team, but Life is only once, and if the team is not working, then it may be time to play solo for the rest of the match.

My wife conveniently fell asleep ten minutes into a movie (that she'd invited me to watch a week prior with an e-vite) on v-day.

The next night, being kid free for the whole night, when we went out for our v-day meal she invited us over to friends afterward when I went to get the car from the valet. After an hour there she commented that she was so tired she was going to pass out.  Similar behavior happens on birthdays and anniversaries as well.  Often if she doesn't have an escape mechanism she'll over consume alcohol and pass out in the car on the way home.

I've come to have no expectation of physical intimacy on these days, and yet I'm still depressed and resentful when it doesn't happen, especially after the ""perfect"" day.

I've come to realize that ""normal"" couples actually expect that there will be physical intimacy on these days.  My wife on the other hand has insinuated in the past that sex after an emotionally intimate day somehow cheapens, or cancels out the validity of the earlier intimacy.  As if she's paying for the emotional intimacy with 'sex' and if I really loved her I wouldn't expect anything on these days... and yet she expects gifts, cards, poems, thoughtful gestures, and expensive dinners. By God it better all be pre-planned and perfect as well or she won't trust it as heartfelt.

She doesn't even seem to care how it's affecting me.,49,14,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/14xdv0/wife_just_shot_me_down_again_she_doesnt_even_seem/,"Same old, same old you may always hear in DB. We've been married 6 years, have two kids. The last couple of years have been rough as in me working a lot while she was pregnant, and now since the baby is 8+ months old, I thought (incorrectly) that once we started to have time together that we would actually spend time together. It is hard, with kids, to find the time to even talk. Harder to have an opportunity to be intimate. I have waited, and waited, and waited. I have been patient. She knows this and agrees. But there are a few rare times when she is not exhausted from work and/or waking up a few times every night to care for the baby, that the opportunity, I feel, should be seized. But that even rarely happens. 

One time before when I tried to initiate sex and got shot down, she said ""Oh, why do you look so sad?"" I said: ""Why do you think? There is some reason you don't want to fuck me."" She walked over and **patted my fucking head** and said ""aww, poor daddy."" I told her that was the most condescending, patronizing, insensitive thing she has ever done. And I told her that I was pissed, not sad. 


Then take tonight for example. It's the weekend, right? The older kid went to bed early (for her) and my wife had time to sit and relax and we talked and laughed and had fun together for a hour. I said I was taking a shower, why don't she meet me in the bedroom? I get out of the shower and she remarks that she never agreed to **that**. I wait a few minutes, try to initiate sex by sitting by her and trying to kiss, etc. and got all the same responses: grunts, shrugs, eyerolls, pushing me away.. She said ""maybe I'm not in the mood.""  I said ""Maybe? There's always a slim to none chance you are."" I walk outside to smoke and come back in. She's getting ready for bed and acts like its no big deal.

I thought I have done everything I could to sensitive to what she goes through as the mother of my children and I have not push the issue hard, I think. I wait, wait, and wait some more for the time and opportunity. And when that opportunity comes up? When there is none of the usual excuses? She **STILL** isn't in the mood. 

I'm so tired trying that I don't want to even try anymore. I honestly cant take the rejection anymore. She *knows* this upsets me. I make it very obvious and I don't act passive-aggressive. I don't want a friend. I don't need a roommate. I need a spouse. One that wants and needs my affection just like I need hers.

Well, we've been broken up for a few months now. We're trying to finish out our apartment lease, so we're stuck in the same house for now. I've been seeing a few people over this time. Life is okay. 

This weekend, we sat down for a talk about what went wrong in our relationship. He finally confessed that it was two things:

- The novelty was gone. He craved new experiences with different women and started to find it a chore to be with the same woman all the time. He said he's had a lot more fantasies about me since we've been broken up, because I'm not available to him anymore. 

-He confessed that he's always had a post-coital repulsion/depression response that he's tried to keep hidden from me. With me, and with with previous girlfriends, he's felt sad and disgusted after having sex. He felt that way after viewing porn as well (frequent porn user), but felt better about it because he didn't have to spend time with the porn girls afterward. 

So, I'm glad I finally have some closure on what was wrong. I just wish he'd been willing to talk about it earlier. For years, he lied and said it was ""stress"" or he ""didn't know"" what was wrong.  

For lower-libido partners, I just want to ask you to be honest with your partners. The guessing game is no fun. Also, it's impossible to fix a problem if you don't know what it is, and it's difficult to let the relationship go if you plant false hope in your partner.

A few months back I decided that my situation was not going to improve, and I just need to focus on what is important to me. Namely my kids, my health and my relaxation. So I became awesome dad... at least in my mind. I tried to be the guy that was fun, but fair. I did not become a pushover, but rather I engaged my kids. I had fun with them and made a point to focus on the ones that were not tuned out from the world. 

Next, I was approached by a friend to join a band. I debated about a week on what to do and finally I joined. I was thrilled to be having fun again with music, and I often brought my kids along with me to play with the other band members kids and see what daddy was doing.

Finally, as cliche as this sounds I joined an exercise program at my local gym. I was not fat by any means but i have started to slim a bit and muscle a tiny bit. (not a a lot but I went back to 2 pants sizes ago.)

In the midst of all this, my wife was going through some medication changes again with her psychologist psychiatrist team. She was and is still off work and I told her, to take whatever time she needs to get herself right. I also encouraged her to join a similar exercise program at the same gym to get a bit more exercise and some social interaction, which she joined.

Four months have passed since I started making plans and doing the things I decided to do. And in that time, I have had more sex in the last 2 months than I have in the last 5 years. She has dropped weight as have I and her self image and libido have drastically improved. I am coming off of a weekend where we were doing ""Something"" on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This is not the first time that this has happened in the past few months either, more like the 3rd or 4th time. We actually made it through a 12 pack of condoms and it didn't take years.

I don't know if my story is typical or I just got a break. But I do know that there is a bit of hope in this, and I wish I had done this earlier. Not every DB has to end in divorce or giving up.

1376593931.0,37,self.DeadBedrooms,1kfqot,My wife and I are in our late 30s and it's more like a business than a relationship,42,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1kfqot/my_wife_and_i_are_in_our_late_30s_and_its_more/,"First off, it's a throwaway account, so be as honest as you want. It's ok, I'll still respond.


We've been married for around ten years, have no kids on our own but have them from our previous marriage. All of them are teens.


Quick background on me. My last marriage ended because she was hardly ever in the mood and was very immature. I tried everything I could think of about how to make things work and get the spark back; more romance, flowers, music, dancing, time away, etc... I even went so far as to write her love letters and sneak them into her purse, etc... After 2 years of trying I gave in to my own needs and looked elsewhere. Yes, I cheated on her, many many times with several married women, women from my work or customers who just wanted to have a ""good time"". Hey I fucked up, I know I did. But that was then. And to any guys thinking about doing that, trust me, it's not a good idea to do so. even if you never get caught, it decreases your self-worth and while being ""fun"" at the time, it does fuck with your head and your priorities. 


After we divorced, I found a new job, cleaned up my life and stayed away from ""dating"" for several months, getting my head and priorities straightened out. 


I met my wife and about a year later we were married. This was a woman who I saw as being a great wife and mother to our kids. She had her priorities straight, was open and honest about everything, career and family minded, had no dirty habits (smoking, drinking, drugs, etc...) and came from a nice family. Sounds perfect right? 


After about 2 years I started to see her libido go down, she also gained about 40 or so lbs in that time. I didn't honestly care about it, I fell in love with her for her mind, not her dress size or anything outward. I still desired her, still wanted her, still would do anything for her. These were all things I professed to her many many times. In the last 2 years she's lost all the weight she gained and then some, which puts her well under 150 lbs. I know this because she tells me and I listen. She looks fabulous and I'm very proud of her. I'm not too shabby myself either. I'm around 6' tall and I've had my weight issues too since we got married, but have been working out for about a year and am at a normal weight and starting to look good with my shirt off, as in there is plenty of definition in my arms, chest, shoulders, back, legs and so on. Together we've worked our asses off to get in shape to look and feel better. 


Overall I still want to desire her, but it's becoming increasingly more difficult. Lately I'm starting to care less about her or her needs, or trying to get anything going with her. When the subject of being intimate comes up, she gets uncomfortable and wants to change the subject. And on the rare occasions that she doesn't mind talking about sex, she talks about how ""real women"" don't really want to, they don't like giving a BJ, they're all uncomfortable with their bodies, they don't talk about sex or like talking about sex, they do it because their man wants it. I get it, women hate having sex and just do it to get their men to stop bugging them, blah blah blah... Statistics and medical journals on human sexuality say otherwise, but what do I know. 


When we go out, she usually keeps her head buried in her phone on several social sites or playing some game with her friends. I've tried to talk to her, or said ""why not put your phone down and have a conversation with me"", to which her response is typically snide, ""Well, what do you want to talk about?"". Me I'm more inclined to talk about ideas, places, concepts or our future whereas she's more inclined to discuss people or things. More often than not when we do talk it's more about the business of ""family"", kids, school, bills, vacations, appointments, etc... She does tell me often how she loves me, likes me and says I'm the best thing that has ever happened to her. I mean I make her laugh, I make her happy, she says over and over how I'm the least stressful thing in her life.. so I don't get it. 


Because getting her off turns me on, I love eating her out and she loves when I do that. But after going to the gym or after a long day, I always wash up before bed, she on the other hand, more often than not, doesn't take a shower or even brush her teeth before bed. That lack of personal hygiene by itself is gross and a HUGE turn off to me, so again I don't try to get anything going as a result. On the days or weekends where all the kids are gone, she would much rather lay on the couch watching shows on E! or TLC than go to the bedroom. The part that is really upsetting is that on the rare occasion that I've had to go out of town on business, she'll all of a sudden be in the mood and try to spend all afternoon in bed with me the day before. But that's the only time that ever happens. 


I've said all this to her before, I've tried every strategy I can think of, being nice, being a jerk, being logical. She'll just cry and get upset. Sometimes she'll ""want to"" for a day, but most of the time it's nothing and then she'll forget that the conversation ever happened by the next day. There were a few times in the past where she'd be a little flirtatious, texting me during the day, but forget it ever happened when we get home from work. I think I have tried every plan in every book about how to get things better, bring a spark back, but I think that after all this time it's all for nothing and I'm just ready to give up entirely. The last time we did anything was about 3 weeks ago and then two weeks or so before that. With the exception of the vacation we just went on, a friend's wedding we went to a few years back and the occasional star alignment, almost everything we've done for the last 4 years has been purely vanilla and about as bland as a piece of toast. As in lights off, missionary or her on top, she'll cum, I'll cum, she retreats to her side of the bed and I'll retreat to mine. On the rare occasion that the stars do align, the sex is a little less vanilla and more rainbow sherbet, it's good sex. With the exception of the vacation, I can count on one hand the number of times since January 1st. 


We've been to therapy at my suggestion, but she said it was a waste of time and after 5 or 6 sessions we quit. She thought it was stupid. For the last few months I'm looking at just staying with her until the kids move out, at least 4+ years, and just moving on with life, maybe even moving out of state and living alone for a while. I say that because I know the kids need a stable environment and to turn that upside down for them or make their lives difficult in any way is not fair to them.

I don't get to clock in and out...I am ALWAYS responsible and I realize that that is what being a parent is, but I'm frustrated by the fact that my husband seems to think sex 1-2 times a week means something is wrong with me.

By the time he gets home from work I am exhausted, and half the time I have to go and work shortly after he gets back anyway. So by the time I get home late at night I am just not in the mood. My body is sore. I'm mentally and emotionally drained. Sometimes I just have sex with him anyway so that I can ""buy some time"" and know he won't pester me for another few days. I always end up enjoying it--I like sex, and think the sex we have is wonderful--but I don't always want to start. All of this is made worse by the fact that I at times feel like his mother due to the constant cleaning up after him. Doesn't exactly get me in the mood for sexytime.

He will probably read this because he has been bringing up this subreddit with me recently and it makes me think that he believes we have a ""dead bedroom."" I personally do not feel that sex 1-2 times a week, with how busy we are, means there is something horribly wrong. From his perspective, I think sex is not just a physical thing or a closeness thing but it is also about his self esteem. He has low self esteem and having sex seems to be the only way to temporarily ""fix"" it. I get it but I cannot be 100% responsible for how he feels about himself. It isn't fair...that is a lot of responsibility for me! 

One more thing...how can I explain to him that when I'm doing ""mommy"" things I don't want to be sexual? If I'm standing there making a bottle, sometimes he'll come up and slap me on the ass or grab my boobs. I understand he's being playful but when I have a baby on my hip and I'm making food, or cleaning spit-up, I am not in a place where I want to be groped! I tell him this and he gets offended and feels that I am rejecting him!

Anyway I'm sorry for this being so jumbled. Lots of issues, and I'm willing to work on it. I don't know if I really classify myself as having low libido. I feel like my libido is about average for a person who has a new baby, works, etc. I am still very attracted to my husband. I enjoy sex with him. I don't think about other men.

Things had started to look up a bit recently. Although we haven't had that much more sex we have had a bit more fooling around and I even got a couple of blowjobs! They weren't great but still better than nothing.

However last two weeks or so any time I have tried to initiate anything she has shot me down. So she is aware that I am really horny and I've been noticeably cranky about it as well as she won't ever leave me alone long enough to masturbate. So today we are getting done and she comes out the shower and calls me into the bedrooms. She is laying there completely naked and freshly shaven. I think to myself that I'm finally going to get some. She asks for some oral and I oblige, because of how on edge I am I put everything I can into it.

Then she cums, and says thank you and gets up and starts getting dressed leaving me sitting there on the bed naked and hard. I feel so fucking used by her, this isn't the first time she has done something like this but usually she will apologise and say she isn't in the mood or coming made her tighten up too much for sex. Not this little pat on the head and a thank you.

I just don't know how someone can be so selfish, I never not finish her off. No matter what we are doing if we are having sex and she doesn't come then I will always make sure to finish her off after or if on the rare occasions she gives me head or a handjob it would never occur to me not to get her off after.

I don't even know why I'm writing this I'm just so angry and need to shout it ourlt somewhere.

[NSFW],45,8,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1ez7i7/is_it_time_for_me_26m_hl_to_end_it_with_my_gf26f/,"5 year relationship with girlfriend, Living together for almost 3 years. Same cliched dynamic you see here all the time ""everything is GREAT...except for the sex"".

We never had the honeymoon period like some here. I think we averaged somewhere around once every 3 weeks until we moved in together. It gradually went from once every 3 weeks to about once every 5/6 weeks. Today, its been two months since we've had sex last. We are generally affectionate with each other, what usually stops it is me getting frustrated after a month without sex and i'm a bit short with the hugs &amp; the kisses.

Sex, for us, happens in one of two ""rapey"" ways:

*1) She's changing. I opportunistically ""corner"" her, and start kissing and fingering her and after a brief struggle and comments like ""You're being bad"" or ""We have to leave soon!"", she relents and we have sex. 

*2) We've turned in for the night. It's been a few weeks since our last time, i'm really horny, I lean over and start fondling her, I see how she reacts to the fondling. If she clams up or moves my hand, I immediately stop, wait for her to fall asleep, go into the bathroom to rub one off and then go back to bed. If she lets it continue, we have sex.

We've spoken about these issues over the past couple of years, but what usually happens is we have a sudden change in frequency of sex (twice in a week), but the status quo quickly returns.

We've been together long enough for her family &amp; friends to start throwing underhanded comments about how its time for us to get married. 7 months ago one of her siblings coworkers took it upon himself to tell me to ""Man Up"" and propose. That night we had another talk and she told me that she believed the sex issues could be worked on/fixed after marriage, to which i replied that I loved her and wanted this to work, but I was **NOT** marrying her until this situation was fixed. She cried uncontrollably for a few hours, i felt like a douche and we go to sleep after cuddling.

Two months ago, I again bring up my dissatisfaction with the situation. I tell her that i'm reaching the point where i feel like we are just really good friends and roommates. Instead of stopping after the water works, I continue.

We established that she's reluctant about refusing my advances and is only going along due to feeling guilty about rejecting me and the gradual change in mood that she sees after weeks without sex. I say I dont want pity sex and it makes me less likely to initiate. She says she only realizes something is wrong because of my mood after a few weeks without sex, but she doesn't know what to do, and that it is easier to ignore the  issue than to try to do something about it.

I guess my main question for DB is whether you think this situation is salvageable or if there is something else I can try? I've mentioned an open relationship, but thats a no go. Scheduling sex hasn't worked for us. Passive aggressively not initiating just makes me more frustrated and of course she wants sex even less.  Any suggestions?

TL;DR : Girlfriend of 5 years has reached the point where she is only having sex because she feels guilty about rejecting me. I dont think i can continue on with a relationship where I'm only getting pity sex. Open relationship is a no go. I've thought about cheating, but wouldn't do it.

1366497700.0,36,self.DeadBedrooms,1crmua,"Tried to have sex with my wife last night (deadbedroom). Communication is so bad, I think I sexually assaulted her. I feel devastated, again. :(",46,10,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1crmua/tried_to_have_sex_with_my_wife_last_night/,"My wife (33) has a history of pain and anxiety during sex, as well as a multitude of other sexual issues( giving oral sex is one) due to a threesome that went horribly wrong during her grad night where she lost her virginity. She was extremely drunk and couldn't tell them to stop. It wasn't violent, but she froze and it all just happened and she had no control. Her sexual history is one of making many poor choices and having sex with strangers, one night stands, unprotected sex, etc... She needs to drink to break down her anxiety in order to 'enjoy sex'. This also seems to let her become more 'ready' for sex and less anxious about penetration, but as excepted it is a double edged sword. Her past is coming out in our relationship dynamic. Fairly early on in our relationship, we were making love, and she started crying. I (42) thought she was releasing some emotions, as in the past we had both been pretty emotional about how right things felt for us after coming out of shitty relationships. We were really in love.

Turns out that she kind of froze and couldn't get it out that she was trying to get me to stop. You know those times when your lover whispers to stop, and it means hold on a minute. This triggered something inside her related to her past. I was so incredibly sad that I didn't pick up on her cues. She never said stop in a way that I recognized as really meaning exit and stop making love. She didn't try to move away from me, or verbalize anything that made me realize she wanted me to completely stop. At the time I was holding her tenderly, and had stopped moving inside her, but hadn't got off her. That was almost 4 years ago, and it is something that has triggered  trust issues about how men have 'needs' and the urge to get off is stronger than them listening to her. I can only assume this is related to the date rape from when she was a teen. If she firmly asked me to stop, or did any other sort of action suggesting she wanted to stop, I would of course stop. We've been through counseling to talk about it, and I thought we both realized it was a big mis-communication.

Except since then, our sex life has never come back. We've since been married and had 2 kids. We have a deadbedroom. 

Last night, she went to bed early as I went out for a night mountain bike ride. I got home late. She was asleep. She has, on a number of occasions said that she enjoys to be woken from sleep to have sex. It's not very often she wants this, but once in bed, I tried to touch her in hopes we could make love. Normally if she is not interested, she moves, or says to stop. She is very clear and I stop.  But last night she didn't. I continued to touch her and eventually pulled down her panjamas. I started going down on her, and thought she was warming up to me. Once again, I heard nothing, and she didn't motion for me to stop. She lied there and I heard her breathing speed up. I took that as she was liking my attention. 

I entered her. After a minute or two of gently stroking, she said, ouch, you are hurting me. I stopped, and and then just lied with my head on her stomach and hugged her. I didn't know she was frozen in panic. After lying there for a few minutes, kissing her tummy, she finally said 'get off me'. She got up and left the bedroom. She was distraught. 

I feel like the worst person ever. The night was very difficult and she wanted to be alone. I felt like throwing up. I've cried so many times today. I love her so much. I'd do nothing to intentionally hurt her. I just want intimacy and closeness. I can't figure out in my head if I'm simply ignoring suttle cues to stop, or if our relationship dynamic causes these horrible results. 

I don't feel that I can talk to her about my perspective of what I thought happened, as last night was traumatizing for her, and I'm sure she is having a far harder time with what happened than I am. I just feel guilt, shame, confusion, sadness, and that I have done this horrible thing to my lovely wife. She told me today that she wanted to remind me that she loves me. I just don't feel worthy.  

TL;DR ~ My wife is unclear about wanting to stop, and last night triggered a lot of past trauma for her. Again. I feel like the worst person ever.

1364804029.0,35,self.DeadBedrooms,1betr0,"Re-thinking ""the talk""",39,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1betr0/rethinking_the_talk/,"We've all had some version of ""the talk"" with our LL partners. In most cases it doesn't work. In some cases it just makes things worse. If communication in relationships is key, why does the talk not work? I've spent some time thinking about it looking at my own experiences and reading about the experiences of others. Here's what I've come up with...

* **It's accusatory** - we're saying there's a problem and it's their fault. I'm no psychologist, but human nature seems to be to go on the defensive when attacked. When we come to our partners and say ""I'm not happy with our sex life."" the unspoken follow-up is ""and it's all your fault."" Even if we don't say it or even aren't thinking it this is how they take it. And then they go on the defensive which means that almost nothing productive will come of it. In many cases they start deflecting - they make an excuse as to why sex has dropped off - one or both partners will come to believe that excuse and start thinking ""If _______ gets fixed then we can have more sex."" But that's not really the problem at all. It's also not fair to the HL partner - it puts the pressure on them to fix what might be external circumstances, or blames them for character flaws when I'm sure the LL partner also has character flaws. The HL isn't letting those get in their way of wanting sex. In the worst case they turn it back on the HL, make them feel shame or guilt for not being satisfied. This is where we hear counter-arguments like ""Is sex that important to you? Is that all I am to you?"" It's a defense and thanks to our mostly sex-negative culture, it's a good one. Many HL's back down here and will have trouble bringing the issue up again. Issue averted.

* **Sex becomes a chore.** If sex has dropped off in the relationship chances are the LL isn't thinking about it much. Coming to the LL and saying how no sex is a problem now turns it into something they feel like they have to do. ""Uh-oh, my HL partner isn't happy so I'd better do something about it."" isn't sexy at all and is I think the wrong way to approach the situation. Best case, they make an immediate effort to quiet the HL before falling into old patterns - worst case they start feeling pressured to have sex which leads to them wanting sex even less.

* **No sense of importance.** We say we're unhappy during the talk. However we show the LL that we are happy by continuing to be caring, supportive, loving partners. A simple case of actions speaking louder than words. In most cases we simply say ""there is a problem and I'm unhappy"" without outlining how this is going to affect the relationship - will it end in separation? Having sex with other people? Sometimes we calm those fears during the talk, which gives our LL partners almost zero incentive to do anything about it. Again I'm no psychologist, but in my experience people tend to protect the status quo, especially if it works well for them. Why work to fix a non-existant problem?

Okay, so those are the problems with ""the talk"". How do we solve those problems? If we had a good answer for that maybe we wouldn't be in this sub. But I've been thinking about that as well and here's what I've come up with...

* **Start off by assessing your LL partner's views and feelings towards sex.** Don't make it a ""the talk."" Just have a conversation about how they feel about sex and the role it plays in relationships. Specifically, yours. Have they noticed the drop-off? How do they feel about it? Are they indifferent or did they also take note? Do they care that you're not having that much sex? Or is sex something that's nice when it happens, but not necessary. Finding out where your partner stands on the issue will be important in moving forward. At this point you may want to be more of a listener than anything else.

* **Next communicate your views and feelings towards sex.** Once you've listened to your partner's take on sex, now share yours. Talk about how sex functions for you in a relationship. Whatever that is for you - feeling the bond of physical intimacy, the joy of giving your partner sexual pleasure, the feeling of being loved and desired, etc. Try to include specifics about what you want - ""I have a very high sex drive as well, so ideally for me intimacy would be 4-5 times a week. And it makes me very happy when my partner also initiates, as it shows me that I'm desireable."" Try to simply just talk about how you feel, don't direct anything towards your partner specifically. Ideally your LL partner will give you the same listening courtesy you gave them. Ideally, but as we all know the world is far from ideal and relationships can be crazy irrational at times.

* **Now talk about sex as it relates to your relationship.** With any luck by this point your partner has realized that there's a difference in how the both of you approach sex in a relationship. Acknowledge this difference, and tell your LL partner - ""I'd like us to work together in finding a middle ground that works for the both of us."" Hopefully your partner isn't feeling pressured or defensive at this point. Remember your ideal you talked about before? You're going to have to come down a bit. Take into account what your partner said at the beginning and adjust accordingly. ""I'd love 4-5 times a week, but I know you're not as into it as I am so 2-3 times a week would make me very happy. And I know you may feel uncomfortable initiating, so how about we come up with an innocent sign that lets me know you'd like to have sex?"" 

As for the importance aspect... I haven't quite figured that one out yet. If things are going well up to this point, it feels like a monkey wrench to say ""And I'm out if this doesn't get resolved."" At the same time your LL partner needs to know that it is an issue they can't blow off. Personally I feel like walking on eggshells doesn't help either of you. If your partner looks you in the eyes and says ""Would you be willing to leave me over this?"" You should be able to answer ""yes, if we can't find a resolution that both of us are happy with."" 

Not to say that this method solves any of the other problems - your LL partner may still not consider sex to be that important, they may still get defensive, they may still try to deflect things onto you. This was just an idea I had for another way to approach the talk that isn't as confrontational.

My wife has this ex-boyfriend she keeps in touch with, I'll probably refer to him by some derogatory name, because well, he's an asshole.  He's a loser, separated, unemployed and working on his undergrad degree for the 4th time at the age of 35.  His wife dumped him for someone else, he smokes and he's missing teeth.

Every once in a while he'll pop out of the woodwork and ply his slimy words on her.  When she'd talk to him, I'd feel jealous, but chalk it up to being mistrusting and try to come to a place where I'm ok with things.  The fucker would pop his ugly head up once in a while, maybe every year or so - they were removed by a 4 hour drive, so I didn't worry too much.  Time went on.

In the meantime, over 7 year of marriage, we had 2 kids and a dying bedroom.  We'd average sex about twice a month, 2 * 12 * 7 = :(, and it was pretty bad.  Standard DB sex here.

I asked her to see a counsellor, and we did, but I always felt responsible somehow.  I wasn't loving her enough, I wasn't giving her enough attention outside of the bedroom,  I wasn't doing enough chores, the kids were too much work, she didn't have enough time out of the house, work was too stressful, she felt fat, gassy, had to poop, the wind wasn't blowing from the right direction.  I got more and more frustrated.  Every once in a while she'd had a small breakthrough with the counsellor, like she was abused by a teacher when she was younger.  That wouldn't have affected me loving her, but I would have approached our relationship in a different way.

We both went on a diet, lost a lot of weight and she started feeling good about herself and then the douchebag popped up last spring.  I got that jealous feeling again and she'd downplay their relationship ""Aw, we're just friends"" or ""I don't *have* to talk to him, tell me if you want me to stop"".  Finally over the summer I got suspicious and went through her email and found a bunch of sexually explicit emails of what he'd like to do to her.  I immediately confronted her with it and she downplayed it saying she shot him down (but kept his email and didn't tell me?).

Suddenly her libido came back.

She was down to fuck 3-4 times a week.  Sometimes even twice a day.  I enjoyed the attention, but was mindful of the guy she was chatting with.  He'd suddenly started showing up in places he knew she'd be, even showing up at my house when I was away for the weekend.  I started freaking out.

We started going to counselling again and the counsellor tried to convince me that the guy was 'just her best friend who happened to be male', I disagreed strongly, but it felt like we made some progress.  I was supposed to go away in late September for a week and told my wife that I didn't want this douchebag coming over.  She agreed, but he came over anyway.

After that, the counsellor agreed that numbnuts was trouble and suggested my wife stop talking to him for three months while we healed.  My wife was super-upset and I told her it felt like I was helping her through a break up.  Eventually she stopped and I thought things were fine.  We weren't having sex and the relationship was strained, but I believed we were on the path to fixing things.  He was gone, right?

Last weekend I went away to a conference and she asked me if she minded if she went to visit some friends in Ottawa, the douchebag is in the next town over.  She said she wanted to talk to him and tell him goodbye.  I reluctantly agreed (couldn't she tell him that over email?) and off she went.

 She came home and I asker her how the weekend went and she said ""Oh, it was a weekend"" and that was that.  I pushed her on it over the next day and she admitted to spending time with him, but told him she was getting off the fence and choosing me.  Then she said something that implied she did something bad, and after pressing her, she admitted to having phone and video sex with him.

At first, I was ok with it.  Well, not ok, but I was happy she admitted it, but then I remembered that she'd lied about her feelings towards him and that they were 'just friends', it began to eat away at me.  I asked her if that was the extent of it and I got a feeling that there's more to the story.  If there is, she isn't talking.

I packed my bags and went to my friend's house.  I've been doing some homework our counsellor gave us, trying to work through the problem on my own.  I feel that I've been more than understanding and it's time for her to man up, so to speak.

We've had sex once in the last 2 months and it didn't go well, I couldn't maintain an erection.  I know sex isn't the priority at all, but I feel like there's no intimacy.  I feel like the father who's locked his daughter away, not like a husband with a loving wife.

For her side of the story, she doesn't seem to be all that self-aware.  She doesn't know why it got to this point and doesn't know how to stop hurting me.  I feel like I'm married to someone I don't know.

I feel like I want it to work out, even just for the sake of the kids, but I'm not sure how to make it happen.  I still love her, despite the lying.  I'm sure there's a good person in there, she's just lost.  Of course, I could be deluding myself, but I've known her almost 10 years now and I know her pretty well.  Apparently she has a libido, and it can be unlocked, I just don't know how to do it and she's not telling me.

Thanks for reading, I'm not really expecting replies, but telling the story helped me process a few thing.

The day of reckoning has finally come to pass. Today, my wife filed for divorce. When I spoke to her about our issues last week, I was optimistic. We ended things on a very high note. 

On Sunday though, things got out of hand. I mentioned that we hadn't started to look for a therapist yet and was hoping we could maybe take some time to put one together that day. Things turned mean. ""If I fuck you , will you finally shut the fuck up about this?"" I couldn't believe she said it like that again. We had talk about the importance of intimacy. But instead she was just putting on an act, hoping to buy herself time till the next time I wanted to talk.

I'm sad because I love her for so many reasons. I'm scared because I've always been there when she needed me and I realize I have no one to lean on tonight. I'm angry because I feel like I worked my ass of since her suicide attempt and never once got the compassion and love I sought from her. 

But I'm also relieved. My life will be open. Now I can do some things I have only talked about. I can meet someone who does care about me and wants to show me.

1349900692.0,33,self.DeadBedrooms,119qvv,My wife has suggested an open marriage.,44,11,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/119qvv/my_wife_has_suggested_an_open_marriage/,"I [M]31 have been married for 5 years now, dated my wife [F]30 for 2 years prior, so a total of 7 years. While dating and in our first years of marriage my wife told me how important sex was to her and how important sex was to maintaining a healthy relationship. She constantly reminded me of this, but after a couple years her actions didn't follow her sentiment. Sex was lacking and progressively became more and more rare. We would have discussions/arguments about it, and every time she would reiterate that she loved sex and it was so important to her. Meanwhile she would get in fights with me when I was initiating sex to the point that it would stop me in my tracks.

Then came time to have a baby as it was part of our plan and my pregnant wife, with hormones pumping through her body, went crazy. She became super irritable and lost all grip on reality and what a normal relationship should look like. Sex stopped, and during an epic fight about sex, she said ""I hate sex, I have always hated sex, and I never want to have sex again."" The following day I received an e-mail from her apologizing for lying to me all these years, and she admitted to creating problems in our relationship so that she could get out of sex. And she gave me a blank check to go and cheat and to have sex with whoever I wanted (we literally wrote a contract for an open marriage, I did this to take the pressure off her about having sex, but I have no intention of doing it as I am hoping counseling will have some effect). She contacted a counselor and started attending sexual therapy. But the counselor advised that nothing could be done till my wife stops nursing, as it messes with hormones, sexual desire and my wife's state of being.

So it's been 6 months now without sex, which in our contract we agreed to have sex once a month just as a routine and to stay connected. I attempted, last night, to have sex with her, to which she agreed and when we got into the bedroom she literally started crying, and saying ""Why are you making me do this?""... and we didn't.

Furthermore it pains me to look at her cause she is absolutely stunning (9.5/10), its hard to not touch her when she walks by, but now everything is off limits, its a cruel form of torture. I feel like I have been severely lied to and taken advantage of.

So that brings me to my question...the open marriage alternative, should I try it? I have permission to, and I think I have a right to have sex. I feel my wife is lying to me again about wanting to change through counseling and I feel this holding pattern is doing me no good. But I know that the open marriage is just going to open up a whole bunch more problems.  

**EDIT; The E-mail that officially killed our bedroom:**

{throwawayinPDX}

I am sad because I feel that I have hurt you. I feel like our life together is a painful mess and I should have been more honest with you about everything before we got married. I just didn't realize that I felt the way that I do. If I knew what I knew now, I would have told you everything so that you would not be trapped in this situation. I realize that I am mean to you because I don't want to have sex period. If I am mean, you won't want to be around me and as a result, I escape having to have sex. This issue has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. I wish i could change this. I hate that I have this problem. HATE IT! However, I realize that I can't change this part of me as much as I want to. I am not sure why and will be accessing counseling to see what the root cause of this is. I just know that I can't change this part of me right now and probably not for a long time, if ever. I am ashamed to admit it, but {some friend} and I have something in common-sex is for procreation not enjoyment and I hate that this is true. 

I have been a miserable mean person to you and I feel bad. I really do. Our discussion last night has made me realize what the real issue is that it really can't be fixed. I feel a mixture of pain and relief because I am finally being honest with you and myself. I just wish I would have known all this before we got married so that way we could be on the same page and you would not feel tricked or misled. 
I am sorry for the way I am. I just can't help it. I wish I could change my inability to be sexual but I just can't. Therefore, I feel that it is fair to give you the option of a open marriage in the vein hope we can be friends and maintain a family without hating each other. i just don't want to deprive you of what you need. With this arrangement I can be nicer to you and appreciate you for who you are without being ashamed of myself and my inability to be a ""good wife/partner"". 

I do ask that you please do not tell me about the women you meet, etc. I would rather not know who they are or when/where you meet them. 

I do love you. I do want a life with you. I just can't lie to myself anymore. The clutter and chaos of construction and everything along with balancing my role as wife, professional, friend, teacher, housecleaner, dog walker, the list goes on and on. I have truly reached my limit and the only way I know how to deal with it is to lash out at you. I am sorry for that. It is not your fault. I know you are working as hard as you possibly can to make my/our life better. 

This email is not intended to foster pity or another discussion between us. Rather it is hopefully gain understanding and closure on an issue that has plagued both of us for the past 5-6 years.

Love,
{wife}

Thank you all so much!",42,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/10kfqc/goodbye_dead_bedroom_thank_you_all_so_much/,"I (26m) have been married to my wife (24f) for five years now. Early on, sex became an issue for a month or two at a time, then we'd fuck like rabbits, then off again. After we had our daughter (15 months ago) sex dropped off considerably. It was a perfect storm: torn vagina, her OCD, and then the medication her therapist suggested to treat her OCD (which KILLED her libido), as well as her birth control and a few issues with our relationship (which have since been resolved to our mutual satisfaction).

It got pretty bad for me. Maybe once a week at best, and that just wasn't cutting it. I needed more. I was getting frustrated, angry, and sad. I remember once telling her that I was beginning to resent my genitals because of the way I felt. She didn't know what to do and didn't seem too inclined to seek creative solutions. I told her first that I wasn't satisfied, and second that, since she was always turning me down, I wasn't going to try any more. Rejection hurt too much. She said I could sleep with other women if I wanted and I looked at her like she had two heads. I don't want to fuck other women. I want HER.  Shortly thereafter, we had The Talk, and thank God it went well. She's a very reasonable and rational woman when the chips are down. Sex picked up for a bit, dropped off, and picked up again after a lighter version of The Talk.

We started exploring our kinky side more, got into some pretty intense BDSM, and generally went crazy with it. I don't think there's a single thing we haven't tried that doesn't involve blood or human waste. It was awesome!

All of a sudden, out of Goddamn nowhere, it got even BETTER. In the last nine nights, we've had sex seven of them. The two were caused by excessive drinking by both of us the first night, and severe stomach problems on her side the next. No big deal! The sex has been great and she's way more into it than she has been in a while. 

Since our sex life has skyrocketed, I've lost any and all interest in porn and masturbation. I tried looking at porn the other day and it simply did nothing for me. My self esteem has gone through the roof and I've never felt more satisfied and motivated in my day to day. I'm starting a bunch of home improvement and renovation projects, woodworking, and modding my truck. I'm at the top of my game right now. I'm all in on being a great dad and my daughter has been craving daddy time more and more. I feel like a fucking success on all fronts, which I haven't felt for a while. The last few months have been the best of my life by far.

My only advice to all of you before I go is to never give up on somebody you truly love as long as they love you back. It takes work but there's a huge return on investment in most cases. That said, know how much you're worth and know when you aren't being treated with the respect and fairness you deserve. Know when YOU aren't treating who you're with the right way. Be prepared to admit that you are wrong. Be prepared to compromise. COMMUNICATE.

He had come across this forum and had noticed a post by another person that was similar to how he felt.  The guy in the post was saying he didn't want to be tempted to cheat but he was starting to understand why people cheated and was thinking about it.  My husband had opened the post and then left me in front of the computer to read.  I read everything in that post, comments and all, then I read just about every post of the front page.  I was so upset to see that this was how he felt and I had never really understood it.  About a week later I joined reddit and started ""getting my act together.""

Afterwards I finally opened up and said exactly what was on my mind, ""I'm not sure I want to be married any more"".  That's not me softening it up.  I was literally not sure.

Tonight she said she was feeling unloved.  We had another discussion, but this time it wasn't an argument.  I tried my hardest to not blame her for anything.  Once we start accusing each other of things, we get no where. 

I finally got through to her.  And we are finally in agreement about what is going on.  All the side shows and excuses are just that.  The entire problem can be summed up so simply.  She isn't sexually attracted to me.  I'm ""a lot sexier"" than I was a year ago, but it still isn't enough.  If I turned her on, she would be throwing herself at me the same way I am at her.  But the chemistry isn't there.  And it most likely never will be.  Sure, once every few months she is turned on enough that she might be receptive to sex if everything else is going right, but we all have the occasional fantasy about someone we would normally not find ourselves drawn to.

Ironically, we're back to where we found ourselves a year ago.  At first I thought I could become sexier in her eyes.  Then, I thought I had done that and started buying into all the crap and excuses.  But we're back at the beginning.  I don't do it for her.  That doesn't mean I'm not an attractive, sexy guy.  It just means I'm not her type.

In my opinion, this is exactly what is happening with every single one of you.  Don't believe in the excuses.  **Your partner simply isn't into you.**  It's not your fault.  It's not their fault.  It is what it is.  Someone else would find you irresistible.  If only it was the person you married... but there isn't anything you can do about that.

She feels terrible... guilty.  In her own words ""you're perfect"".  She wants to be attracted to me and have a long happy marriage together, but that is outside her control.  She cried.  A lot.  She said she was scared.  She knows.  It's over.  It's only a matter of time.

In under a week, I'll be leaving on a month long business trip, so getting divorced will have to wait.  I'd still like to dream that when I get back she will have missed me so much she can't get enough of me and we can forget this whole ordeal, but I also realize that will most likely never happen.

We've had the talk, and things just don't seem to be getting better.. and i've actually been ok with it. They usually pick up when she can tell i'm upset and then after we have sex once, its no more for who knows how long. 

My post isn't about the DB so much, as it is what I did today about it. 

Countless times I do everything for her, and I never really mind. By that I mean go to friends places, go here, go there, do this and do that, and I always was fine with things until lately. Without sex, i've been finding myself almost annoyed with her, or just starting to not even really thinking of her as beyond a friend anymore. 

Its been upsetting me but i've realized I SHOULD BE HAPPY in the relationship. So the past 3 weeks i've been all about improving myself and having me time, doing things I love and not giving a fuck. 

WELL today I was asked by my gf to go over to her friends house for a house warming party! I was expecting 15 to 20 friends... only to find out its a ""help my friends move party"" and her 2 friends needed us to help them move... plus they invited 3 other people including me and my gf. I didn't want to be 1 of 5 people moving stuff into an apartment with no elevator. 

After getting the news last min today I told my gf ""would you be upset if I didn't go?"" I knew she would be,  but would tell me ""No not at all"". and she did. Now I can tell she is pissed off I made her go alone to help her friends, but when she comes home tonight and starts a fight, my argument is going to be in the last 2 years, i've helped her friends move 6 times, none of them helped me, none of them hardly talk to me, or think of me outside of times they need help. After a week of working lots, being sore, and having no time for myself, to move my own shit that I want to clean in my house, there is no way i'm going to lift a finger to help anyone but myself. 

It may sound selfish, she probably won't get it... but not moving heavy shit right now and having the day home alone to myself makes this the best weekend i've had in a long time. 

Am I being an ass for being a little selfish? should I have done things differently? Does she have a right to be pissed off at me?
I'm mostly looking for anyones opinions, but i'm mostly just venting and I needed someone to tell my story of today to.

tl;dr - Told GF to help her friends move by herself. Saying no to a GF that says no to me.

All day I think about having sex with my wife. All day I try to think of ways I can make her attracted to me enough so she will want to have sex with me. I try to be flirty. Tell her shes sexy. Tell her shes beautiful. I do my best to be loving, and supportive, and spend time with her. I do the things I know she likes me to do, so she will hopefully see that I not only enjoy our time together, but that I want to spend time with her later. Alone. Because I miss her. And then, once we finally get time alone, I feel like I can't get past her barriers. Her too tired barrier. Her not in the mood barrier. Her ill have sex if you want to have sex barrier. Partly because I fear another rejection. Or that she will give me sex because shes knows I want it, but doesn't do a good job of hiding that shes just not in the mood, but I REALLY don't want that. I am more perceptive of her moods than I think she gives me credit for. And some nights, I am fine with overlooking these barriers --because its been too long for me and I need my wife, and once we get into sex, I can tell shes enjoying herself too. But what I truly want and sometimes need, is for my wife to want to want to have sex with me. I don't want the tv to be turned on because she wants me so bad that the tv can wait. Or the laundry can wait. I want to feel like I'm sexy. Sexy the way I think shes sexy. And its been a really long time since I've felt as if my wife thinks I'm sexy. 

And you know what the worst part about this situation is? When she finally tells me she wants to have sex with me and I find it hard to believe. Because there have been so many times, that I get so excited for the idea of my wife wanting to have sex with me that when the time comes and we dont have sex, that my confidence dies a little. And it doesn't come back. When she teases me all day long with things like flashing her butt as she walks up the stairs to shower, I instantly get horny...but then I get a little depressed. Because when it comes down to it, we just wont have sex unless I continue to press the issue all day, with sexy texts, and flirting and loving, supportive husband stuff. And its exhausting. I used to just be able to come up behind her and kiss her neck a little, or kiss her while running my hands through her hair, and we would go at it, like we used to. But now, it tickles and she doesn't get turned on by that anymore. Somewhere down the line, things changed for her and I haven't been able to find a new way to get her to horny. 

It hasn't changed for me though. She doesn't have to do a thing, and I would have sex with her like a dog in heat. She just has to say, ""I want to have sex with you"", and I will drop whatever it is I am doing and do her then and there. And I want to experience that passion from her again. But I'm at a loss as to how to do that. I seriously have no clue. So everyday, I wake up and think of ways to make her want to want to have sex with me. And today I thought I had it in the bag for sure. But the tv came on and that was that for me. I wanted to have sex, but she seemed more interested in tv. Or maybe she expected me to just pounce on her. But with the TV on I couldn't help but see that as a sign that she didn't have sex on her mind. And since all my old tricks don't work, I can't help but fear any attempt I make will just end with rejection or obligation sex. And I would rather masturbate to old videos of her than get either of those. So I just kinda wait and hope. And then things get weird and awkward. And she probably feels a bit rejected herself. But I can't get past her barriers. So we don't have sex. So we say goodnight and I masturbate thinking of her.

No I am not trying to change it just control it. No I am not letting my SO hold me hostage to her LL, just accepted that neither my HL nor her LL is going to change anytime soon and that I get more sex if I don't ask for it 10 times a day.

**Sports**
When I was a hormone crazy teenager I was also a ""no sex before marriage"" kinda guy (I have changed my opinion on that somewhat). I exercised and studied a lot as a means to keep myself occupied and ""away from temptation"".
The same approach seems to be working now. I have taken up team sports again and the time commitment as well as the post game recuperation time needed are reducing the time available a bit. I still want sex all the time but in practice there are two to three days a week in which I physically couldn't even if I had the chance. 

Another positive side effect is that I am toning my body. The have not been massive changes in my physique but the wife has come into the bathroom to ""chat"" whilst I am showering after sport a few times and stayed on staring with a half a smile after the conversation ended. I am not holding my breath that she will want to join in just yet but I see this as progress.


**Work**
I am concentrating more on work during work hours. Purposely giving it 100% during those hours means the day's go by a bit faster. One moment I am driving to work, next thing I know I am back home and have not had time to dwell on asking for sex and getting rejected.  I hardly have any days where I ask myself wtf did I do at work all day only to realize all I did was replay in my head last night's failed attempts at sex.

So now I am not wound up about rejection when I get home. I might still get wound up after I get home but the amount of time I agonize over it is about 10% of what it was before. As a result I am nicer and more loving to the wife. Not that I was not nice before, I just don't have to force myself to be nice or loving.

**Social Life**
I am working on getting a social life. I have never been much of a social animal but I am going out with friends/family/coworkers/sports buddies  once or twice a month. I always thought pple wasted too much time planning their social calendars but it comes in handy at this time. 

Instead of sitting in front of the computer/tv all night stewing about the latest rejection I am out having a better than average time talking about nothing important. It is surprisingly refreshing.

**Sex**
I ask for it maybe once (sometimes twice) a week instead of twice a day. It is hard not to ask when I think there is an opportunity. But we have gone from every 6-8 weeks to once a month. And she has asked for it .... it had been years since the last time she asked for it!

Rejection still hurts though...

**Conclusion**
To me this is mostly about accepting that neither of us is going to change from HL to LL or visa-verse. Some might say it is me capitulating to the LL partner.  I don't know... All I know is i am happier at home and at work, fitter and getting more sex than I had for a few years.

You're miserable about your lack of a sex life, no physical intimacy. You've talked to your partners but nothing changes. You get empty promises, or they refuse to address it, or they turn the issue back on you. You propose solutions and options that all get shot down. 

Why do you put up with this?

For people who are not married and without kids we often advise to just end the relationship. It won't get better - find someone who doesn't make you feel miserable. For many of us with kids or otherwise complicated situations, getting out isn't that simple. I'm not even saying to just leave your partner. I'm saying, why are you putting up with this situation?

Do whatever it takes to make you happy. I don't know what that is - it's different for all of us. Your partner is supposed to make your life better - why are you allowing them to make you unhappy? And if they aren't going to do anything about it, it's about time you do. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who puts forth no effort in solving a problem gets absolutely no say in how that problem gets solved.

In short, what's happening is - 

You - ""I'm unhappy about our sex life.""

Partner - ""Well, I'm not.""

You - ""Here are some ideas I had to improve the situation...""

Partner - ""I don't like those ideas. And I'm fine anyway. So you just deal with it.""

You - ""Oh...okay.""

Why is this acceptable?

It's nice that we have this sub to commiserate together, but even commiserating is still misery. If you are here reading this, and miserable over your DB situation, I urge you to take a moment and think about what **you** can do to change that and be happy.

1356067769.0,32,self.DeadBedrooms,157nvs,Has anyone else resorted to keeping a log? Am I being ridiculous?,41,9,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/157nvs/has_anyone_else_resorted_to_keeping_a_log_am_i/,"**TL;DR - I started keeping a log about two weeks ago that indicates 1) the date, 2) whether or not we had sex, and 3) if not, what her reason was (sick, tired, we had a fight about not having sex, etc.) and 4) if we did have sex, which, remarkably, has been once in the last two weeks, how *into it* she was**

I'm M(30) HL with F(31) LL.

We have been married for 11 years. Two boys, 6 and 11.

If you've done the math, you'll note that we had a bit of a shotgun wedding when we were very young.

We do love each other, at least in the sense that we appear to have resigned ourselves to being life-long companions.

However, I am very physically attracted to her and would have sex every day if she would. She, on the other hand, seems satisfied most of the time with sexless companionship.

Even from very early on in the relationship, sex frequency was low. I think in our best years, we may have averaged twice per month. At our worst, we've gone entire months without it. I don't think we ever got so bad that a year passed. But it's never been good.

And it has always been me as the initiator. I mean *always*. I cannot remember a single time we've made love that she initiated the act. Not. Fucking. Once.

I see on this sub the advice seems to be to talk about it or forget about it (i.e. leave).

In our early marriage, after our first child was born, I would talk to her about it *a lot*. I mean, like, break down sobbing ""why aren't you attracted to me"" type talks. I'm not proud of those breakdowns, but I certainly didn't hide my feelings.

A few years go by with me breaking down on a regular basis, she reassuring me that *she is* attracted to me and that she will try to make it better. Talk after talk. Month after month. Year after year.

Until finally I just shut down. I withdrew emotionally. I was no longer emotionally invested in the relationship. I would sometimes think to myself, ""I regret getting married so young. I wish she would cheat on me so I'd have a reason to leave.""

Fast forward. We're an ocean apart 11 years down the line. Still having sex maybe once a month. But it's more of an occasional attempt on my part paired with a less occasional begrudged acquiescence on her part.

Then one day... I catch her flirting with a coworker on facebook. It wasn't like ""lets fuck"" flirting though and it was mostly him that did the flirting. But clearly not completely innocent either. And I only found out after getting suspicious because she was spending so much time on her phone and wouldn't come to bed until after I was asleep (usually she was the first to go to bed).

Let me put it in context. She doesn't go out late at night. She's always home. She works in a crowded hospital. The guy is 10 years older than her, he's chubby and kinda goofy looking. So I don't suspect  that they've actually consummated their flirtations, but still. It's fucking emotional infidelity and it hurt *bad*. I mean like, I wanted to kill myself type bad. For two days before I confronted her I didn't eat. I was a shaking fucking mess.

It was at that point I realized how much I loved her. I mean *really* loved her. I was head over heals all over again.

We talked about it. We had a really tough few weeks while I got over the jealousy part. And it has pretty much gone away. I truly am not jealous.

I changed everything about my behavior. I am helping out more with the kids. I do shit around the house a ton, now. I was loving, caring. I began to actually *listen* to her when she was talking about the mundanity of her day. I don't hide in the basement on the internet all evening anymore. I started exercising/lifting (i wasn't ""fat"" to begin with, but I've lost a few pounds and packed on some lean muscle). I mean, like, I fucking *changed*.

I also found rekindled desire for her.

Do you know what hasn't changed?

Yep, you guessed it. Our sex life is still stagnant.

Even after I have had the ""why don't we have sex more often talk"" probably three times since this whole thing happened, including a breakdown with some sobbing.

I finally told her that if things don't change soon, I would have to leave. Not because I didn't love her, but because I cannot take the pain of unrequited love any longer without either a) suppressing my emotions again, or b) blowing my fucking brains out.

So it's going to have be change, or we're finished.

She cried, said she can't imagine life without me.... bla bla bla.

That was about three weeks ago.

So, here I am. Keeping a log of how often we have sex.

Ugh.

Edit: to add that I probably don't have the balls to leave her anyway. I'm just venting.

Last night we had the talk. When it began I really had no idea how it would end. In the week prior, I really tried to make a firm decision on what I would do going forward, but there was really just so much to process that I really didn't know. What I did know was that there were things that needed to be said. The kind of things that had never been said before.

I started by telling her that I was unhappy. That the physical chemistry that we once had was gone. She asked if this was about the frequency of sex. I said it was, but that it wasn't just that. Over the years, the lack of intimacy had affected many other things. For a long time, the frustrations over our sex life had caused me to simply not care about trying. And I did that for a long time. And just in the same way that time together with someone you care about will bring you more and move in love, the reverse is also true. I told her that I didn't love her any longer.

She told me that the reason why we didn't have sex is because for women, sex is an more of an emotional thing than a physical thing. She said that she wanted me to do more work around the house. She asked me if I would be willing to do that. I told her that I don't think we would be moving forward from this situation. It's not that I wouldn't be willing to help more. It's just that I'm not a slouch right now. I do many things around the house, and these problems we are experiencing were around even before we started living together. With everything that was said I just knew that there wasn't a real solution there. For each of our past talks, there was a lot of lip service to our sex lives getting better, but it was always extremely short lived. I had to factor that into my decision and be honest with myself when I thought if things would actually get better in the long term.

The problem is that when it came time to say the words, it was far more difficult than I ever imagined it would be. She asked me what does this mean going forward. And I just couldn't say it. As I said earlier, I didn't know what would come from this conversation, and I needed some time to reflect on what was said. I told her that I needed time to think and I went to my close friends place to discuss what had happened. While there, talking about what had happened reaffirmed that I was making the right decision.

When I arrived back home, she was gone. I laid in bed just thinking. About a half an hour later, she arrived home. She took a shower and laid beside me in the dark. We began talking again. The tone of this conversation was different than the last.

I told her that I wasn't attracted to her any longer, and that we need to be apart. She told me that she wished that there was had I felt like this earlier. I told her that this didn't come out of nowhere. I can't describe it well, but she simply said, ""I know"". The way she said it just conveyed everything about the relationship. We had talked about this situation many times in the past. There were many chances to fix things, but for whatever reason they were ignored. To me, ""I know"", just felt like her finally realizing the gravity of what was going on. 

She then said that she didn't want this to destroy things with our friends. I agreed, and told her that I thought she is a good person, its just that we have both changed as we grew older, and that we don't click as a couple, but that I still respect her as a person.

That's pretty much where we are now. It was really hard, but I think that I've made steps to get me to where I need to be in my life.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_14lwtj,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/14lwtj/update_i_think_i_am_ready_for_divorce/,

The wife, over the course of years, has become less and less interested in sex and less interested in me.  It's been a struggle, with her and with myself, but the relationship has survived in some form.

But this week, I had to travel to, well, a city from my house to take care of some business and a women who been a friend of mine for a long time and who lives 100 miles away drove down to see me.  To my surprise (but definitely not to hers) we spent the afternoon making love in my hotel room.

The first time since the late 1980s I'd slept with any woman except the one who is now my wife.  I had contemplated adultery but in all honesty couldn't figure out the mechanics of it.  How do you ask a woman to sleep with you when there's no chance of a relationship?  I never figured it out -- and I certainly never told my friend, but somehow she figured out that her need and my needs meshed.

I had forgot what sex was like, not the physical sensation so much as the intimacy.  I could run my hand from the small of her back to the back of her thigh know that she would probably enjoy it and if she didn't, she would just move my hand to where she would enjoy it, instead of rolling away with a snarl and a sneer.

But the afternoon ended and my friend thanked me and told me this was a one-time thing.

I spent a day moping in the room and went down to the pool.  I sat in the hot-tub talking to an attractive woman in her mid-30s.  After some small-talk, I asked her if she had a boyfriend, because I wanted to know how hard I could flirt.  She said she didn't, so I had to use the inevitable, ""Really, why not, beautiful woman like you?"" piece of cheese.

But she tells me.  She said later she had never told anyone this but for whatever reason decided to tell me.  She explained that after her husband and daughter had been killed in a car accident, she had become a prostitute for several years, to support herself and ""for other reasons"".  She had saved enough money to retire three years ago and she now spent her time making and selling handicrafts.  She told me she hadn't had sex, for money or *pro bono*, in the three years.

I don't know why but I asked if she would like to have sex with me.  She said she would, but I would have to pay her.  I said I would.

I had contemplated adultery in the 10 years or more my marriage had been declining but I had *never* thought about prostitution.  I just didn't get the appeal.

But now I was in her bed, and I was shocked that I found a deep intimacy with this woman.  She really cared for me, or faked that caring so skillfully I couldn't even bring myself to doubt.

I feel nothing like guilt, nothing like apprehension.  I got back home in a few days.  My wife, whatever her faults, is very perceptive.  I think she will just read everything in my face.  I can't say I care.  If she doesn't figure it out for herself,  I don't think I will tell her.

I'm not even sure why I'm telling you people.  I guess it's nice to think someone here might understand.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_q1cl0,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/q1cl0/ive_found_a_few_live_bedrooms/,

Thank you for existing.  Although, I've never known any my entire life, at least now, I know you exist.  Since I was old enough to have physical relationships, all but one of them have been with LL(F)'s, including two marriages (one previous, one current).  Before coming to this subreddit, I didn't even know a woman could get aroused.  I've always been the initiator, the HL.  I couldn't tell you how many times I've been told ""You're just a guy.""  ""It's a guy thing."" ""You're just like every guy out there."" or ""Real women aren't like that."" ""Normal women don't behave like that."" ""Real women don't think like that.""  Especially when a HL woman would be portrayed on TV or in the movies.  I know they're just actresses in a fictional role, but to be told ""A guy must have wrote this script"" over and over...it just gets in your head after a few of decades of hearing it from different women.

""You just need it because you're a guy!"" is still one that burns me to the core.  I'm a human freaking being!  I have feelings and emotions too!  I'm not a walking penis.  I have a brain and a heart.  I'm not looking for meaningless sex.  I want a mutually loving, respectful, physical relationship with someone who loves me the same way.  Why is that so hard to understand? To achieve?  I'm not asking to be raving animals every night (although that might be be fun to try), just more than a couple of times a year and not to have it be awkward and uncomfortable as SO just lies there, hoping I'm quick.

To always feel ashamed of who you are, and the way you feel towards a physical relationship all your life, destroys your self esteem from the inside out.  And have to accept the fact that ""You're the one with the problem"", well...let's just say it hasn't done wonders either.

Until now I had no idea that it was possible for a woman to even think or feel the same way as me.  I'm happy to find out that I was right, and sad for the same reason.  If you're here, then I'm sorry for the situation you're in as well, I wish us both luck.  If nothing else, at least I feel vindicated in the knowledge that it's not just a ""guy thing"", but a ""human thing"".  I wish my SO had friends like you, to tell her this fact.  But I'm sure she would either deny facts as fiction, or just not listen all together, as many of her friends have already told her that they dislike sex as well.

Unfortunately, the one relationship I did have with a girl who was a HL in the bedroom, was psychopath out of it.

1376386991.0,30,self.DeadBedrooms,1k9p6m,I (31m) want to someday send this to my wife (30f),38,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1k9p6m/i_31m_want_to_someday_send_this_to_my_wife_30f/,"I don't know why it's so hard to try and start this conversation. We seem to have pretty good communication in all other areas of our lives, but not this one. 

We've been married now for three years, together for ten - and if I look back and then to where we are now I feel as though we are in as good a place as we've ever been. Sure money is a bit tighter than it used to be, sure there's the stress of running your own business, but it does feel like we've got our shit together. 

I'm also aware that (I hope) that I'm doing a better job of being a husband to you than I ever did as just your boyfriend. I don't know what caused the change, maybe it's just getting older, but I think I took you and our relationship for granted for far too long. I've been trying my best to change this, to be better around the house, to stop doing the things that annoy or upset you, to take much better care of myself to make sure we've got the best shot at a long future together. As you've said - I've changed, and I think it's for the better (and I think you do too). Of course there's always room to improve, and I'm going to make sure I do that.

I think that we've got a good relationship, that we work well together - and although the dynamics change and fluctuate over time, it's both something that we are OK with.

But there's the elephant in the room, the thing that we both know is there but neither of us want to, or are able to, talk about. I don't know why, but that communication hurdle has always been there, looking back, pretty much from day 1, all those years ago.

It's sex, or really it's more than that - more fundamental. I think we've lost sight on how to enjoy each other physically. I know the last 10 years have been full of change and it's been easy to get caught up in other things, being away from home, new jobs, new projects - and probably much of that is my fault, but now life is more stable I can see that there's a gap there - has always been there. 

It's not that I want there to be more of it (ha! ""it"" - FFS still mentally blocking around it, sex, sex, sex - there I said it!) - though I do - but that because we've neglected that area of our lives for so long, it feels ""not right"" sometimes, if that makes sense? I don't get the sense that we are comfortable with each other in the bedroom, that we don't each other's boundaries, desires, wants or turn-ons. While we have been having more sex recently it's almost as if every time is the first time, tentative fumbles - like we aren't growing together like we have done elsewhere.

I don't know what it is - if there is a root cause, maybe it was the years of me staring into screens, or being away from home, or something else entirely. You've very lightly hinted in the past there might be something else in there? Perhaps these are all things we need to talk about? 

But of course I've noticed some reticence at certain times - the one which really sticks in my mind was when we were in the hotel for our anniversary this year. We'd been kissing, with you sat on the chair, I'd led you over to the bed, still kissing you and then, as it became more heated, you grabbed the hotel phone next to the bed and started reading the list of numbers on it! That really threw me and that's part of what's got me confused. 

Men are pretty simple creatures, but we have egos which are very easily bruised - I love all the physical contact we have, just the small things, holding hands when we walk anywhere, your legs up on me when we watch the TV, or even your arm over me when you sleep, snoring gently into my shoulder. All those things make me feel closer to you. So when something like the hotel pops up it's a real blow - and it starts of a chain of thoughts (every time!), ""Does she not love me?"", ""does she not find me attractive?"", ""am I so hideous?"", ""when we do have sex, does she actually want it, or is it just a chore to get through?"", ""am I forcing her? am I a bad person because of it?"" - the trouble with these though is the effects are cumulative, and suspicion sets in - if we do have sex, is it because you want to be close with me, or is it because you think I expect it? It's not a good path to go down - and I try my best to quash those sort of thoughts.

I'll put my cards on the table - I think sex is a cornerstone of a good relationship and marriage. It's very important to me - and in my mind it's what separates a relationship between a couple and close friends sharing a house together. I also think that if this isn't something we address - explicitly, then it's going to put a strain on the relationship, mostly because we'll be locked in the constant loop of trying to fumble our way around things, me approaching at what might be the wrong time, or in the wrong way, and you feeling pressured or unhappy because of it.

And I'm not here to ask for our lives to be like a porn film, wild swinging parties, naked dwarves and eating sushi off a shaved goat - I just want us to get to know each other better, for me to know you better. For us to explore each other, get used to being together that way, so that it becomes the default rather than the exception - for sex to become a core part of our lives rather than something that just happens around it on occasion.

I know this is probably a lot to take in - that making the next steps seem hard - how do we even start this conversation, especially one that's so emotionally charged? But I do want to have that discussion - I run through it in my head every day, and writing this down is just the first step along the way.

I love you, and it's because I do that I'm writing this.

About four years, ago, my SO and I got together after being best friends for more than half a year. It was kind of a surprise to both of us and actually a cute story, because we both secretly had a crush on the other for the month leading up to our accidental make-out session (real talk: booze may have been involved). Anyway, we exchanged ""I love you""s about three months in, and the first time I got her shirt off was by the four month mark. For me, this was VERY slow (I was 20 by this point and had been having consistent sex since I was 14, usually by the one month mark of every previous relationship) but I didn't mind because I really loved being with her. Besides, she is very religious and she was apprehensive about getting too physical. In fact, she started out wanting to wait until marriage.

Anyway, by about 8 months in, we got back to campus from a winter break at college and missed each other so much, we got all the way from barely 2nd to rounding home. I could almost SEE the religious guilt kick in, because even though she initiated us ""trying"" for the first time, not even part of the head was in before she started crying and asked if I would be okay stopping. I said of course, and felt like a horrible asshole for a week (then she smacked me on the head and told me it was mostly her fault and to stop worrying). Anyway, that seemingly broke a barrier and we went from nothing to getting each other off (orally or by hand) almost every other day, sometimes multiple times a day.

Sure there were times I would get frustrated and wish we could have sex, but my big brain outsmarted my little brain, and I never let her know about my frustration. Then, about 2 years in, she started talking about us trying to have sex again. We bought lube and every now and then, during a very long and steamy session, would start getting ready to try. But each time, without fail, she would start to shake or whimper when I was about to penetrate. She promised me that there was no trauma or anything, and swore that she always meant it when she asked me to try. She had no idea what that barrier was. I told her I was okay with waiting until marriage, but every now and then she would still want to try.

About a year and half of this happening at least once or twice a month, I noticed a pattern in my participation in the bedroom. I started feeling EXTREMELY self conscious about doing anything for myself and focused solely on getting her off. If she made a squeak that sounded too much like a pained one, I would lose my erection almost immediately and despite KNOWING that nothing was truly wrong, I would have trouble getting back in the mood. I was really embarrassed by this and would try to pass it off by saying ""Don't worry about me, I just want to do you today!"" It also didn't help that my girlfriend gets SUPER tired after an orgasm and is usually too exhausted to realize that I didn't remove any clothing.

 Then, after a while of just getting her off, she started to get used to that (I guess?) and when I would be turned on enough to initiate some kind of play for me, she would show clear displeasure and go through with the oral/handjob with as little enthusiasm as possible. She still grabs me in public and does things to turn me on all the time, and loves when I do things for her like fingering her while we're in public or getting her off wherever the mood strikes, but as soon as I'm hard and out, she starts to taper off and most of the time it just ends with me finding some excuse to stop contact because I can't take a second more of that bored, distant expression on her face. (btw, I'm always very enthusiastic when it comes to her, and when I'm not she gets very upset. So I have no idea why this is somehow not a two way street...)The only exception is when she decides that we should try again, and like a dumb cartoon character who always falls for the same trap, I get so turned on by her enthusiasm that I can't resist taking the bait, only to then have her cry when the head is barely touching her and hear the same apology.

Lately, when we get together and go on dates or sit home and watch movies etc, I find myself not wanting to do anything sexual at all. When she starts acting sexual, I try to find ways to delay a trip to the bedroom. Even though I act enthused and turned on, inside my head is this ongoing chorus of ""UGH I don't want to do this... I just want to keep watching the movie. Hopefully it won't take very long..."" I just want to get her off and be done with it. Sometimes, I don't even get fully hard; I just feel like I'm doing a duty. 

I went from relationships where I had sex multiple times a day every day (My record was 4 straight months of sex every day with a previous paramore, with multiples some of those days), and very frequent masturbation to the present. Now I dread sexual activity because it just means getting her off and then either being done, trying to get off while she sits there limp-wristing me (or if she gets bored enough, she'll just tell me to use her legs as an aid while she stares off into space), or get cried off of her for the umpteenth time. I don't watch porn or masturbate anymore (I think the last time I got off was about a month ago). I feel so passionless and unhappy right now.

For the record, my SO is not a bad person. She is so caring and compassionate otherwise, and tries to include me in just about every aspect of her life. She comes to my family events and we talk every day at length and it never gets boring. Being with her is happiest I've ever been... apart from having my libido be slowly and surgically torn out of me.

I am truly sorry for this wall of text... I'm a long-time lurker and first time writer and this is basically all coming out as a honesty-vomit. Lately I've just read so many stories of LL's, male and female, just going the extra mile to please their HL counterparts but I haven't seen many stories about sex-selfish, HL females and HL-turned-LL males lying around, so I figured I had to post my story and see if anyone had any advice for me. I'm very lost and I just cried at an episode of How I Met Your Mother because it reminded me of how much I used to NEED my SO sexually.

Long story shortened, in the middle of our relationship i had a form of 'the talk' with my wife.  I wanted us to fix our db.  She said she has to finish school and internship and then will focus on that.  So time goes by, DB continues.  More life events and problems occur that our DB never gets to be a priority for her and i am suffering through all that same crap you readers are dealing with.  Then one day she says she really wants to have a baby.  We talked about this, i do want kids but i have said in the past we need to 'fix our sex' before children.  Didn't happen.

I wanted it to be a natural 'oops' conception and she was ok with that at first.  The first month wasn't too shabby.  She was more interested in sex but not for any real intimate or sexual reasons.  But, i figured it was a good step in the right direction.  At least she made an effort to get me in the mood.  This didn't last too long.  One month went by unsuccessfully, the second month became more of a structured intercourse month targeting ovulation.  This is where things go south.  She resumes her normal dead-fish routine, won't touch me or kiss me or do anything to make this enjoyable for me - i was the solely responsible to make sure i was hard.  I mentioned that this wasn't fun for me and that got me a pity over-the-underwear light touch on my dick.  Which, btw was freeking torture, my mind screaming DONT STOP.  Months tick by until we are able to target her ovulation with a test and it stuck.  job done. go me, i'm going to be a daddy.

Looking back it was fucking terrible.  Early into it I started to resent it even though i participated in it.  ""At least i am getting laid right?"" was how i tried to make myself feel better.  It didn't work.  Every single time it happened i was isolated, alone, frustrated, and *feeling like i had no choice*.  

Now I am relieved it's over, that I no longer have to have to try.  She's now sick and feeling shitty all the time so sexy times aren't even in the picture.  But, what's worse is that I am scared to want to have sex again because I know what I am in for.  So, now I am avoiding all of the arousal-triggers with my wife out of fear of facing those depressing feelings again.  Which is just making me more distant and likely compounding the problem.  

it's all stupid.  I just needed to rant and vent in an appropriate place out of hopes someone knows what I went through...  Please share your thoughts, advice, stories, whatever you got.

1368439910.0,33,self.DeadBedrooms,1e8jeh,To my beautiful girlfriend,41,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e8jeh/to_my_beautiful_girlfriend/,"Whenever I think about our sex life I feel numb.

I feel helpless, miserable, unsatisfied, frustrated, and defeated - all coloured by tinges of selfishness. 

I think it's partly due to your depression. Partly due to the fact that I think you still have a lot of sexual self-discovery to do. Partly due to the fact that I haven't asserted my own desires and needs enough in a relationship. Partly because I'm too tolerant, patient, and nice. Partly because I haven't raised it in totally tactful and considerate ways at times. Partly because I don't think you understand how important it is to me, as much as i've tried to communicate it.

I had a bit of hope when we had sex twice in one day the other week. That hope lingered for about a week. It's started to fade since.

I read a post on /r/deadbedrooms, the sub forum on Reddit for those in a similar situation to what we're in. i.e. Being in a relationship with an infrequent and unfulfilling sex life, or a completely absent one. It was from the partner with the lower libido who spoke about how often she would talk about how she was interested in sex in situations where it wasn't possible.

It kinda rang true to me, the times you'd spoken of how ""you really wanted sex but are just too tired now"". They never felt right to me at the time. And I guess they still don't, because I know when I want sex and it is on the cards I will wake up from the fucking dead to have a shot at it.

It isn't the fundamentally fact that we aren't having sex that bothers me… It's the fact that things do not seem to be changing, and that you seem to have no desire to change it. Or at least, that you do not seem to be willing to take any action to change it. 

I told you that us having a healthy sex life that was enjoyable for both of us was really important to me, and have dozens of times. I felt so much closer and connected to you back when our sex life was frequent, fulfilling, and passionatel. I know sex has been painful for you at times. That fucking sucks and I imagine is awful for you, and understandable that it makes you want it a lot less. But it has an impact on me too - you not wanting sex means I am left sexually unsatisfied. Us being in a committed monogamous relationship means that I remain sexually unsatisfied.

So I tried to talk to you about ideas to either get our libidos closer in sync, or to make sex more enjoyable to you… I read, I researched… You did not seem eager to read anything I sent you or suggested to you. You refused even consider going to a specialist on the grounds that you already had a that appointment that a GP had you referred to pending.

That was about two months before the date of that aforementioned conversation. So I asked if you could call the hospital and follow up on it. You said you would. I felt this was the smallest thing you could do to show you are committed to improving our sex life, one I want to share that is mutually beneficial, enjoyable, and fulfilling.

I waited six days - and you hadn't said anything. So I asked if you had, and you told me you hadn't had time. When I heard this, it, like a lot of other reasons you've made in regard to our sex life, did not strike me as true or honest. When I said I didn't think that was the reason, you acted like I was being unreasonable and got upset at me and told me that it was hard for you to make that call and that it wasn't enough time. I was frustrated because you didn't keep your word and I thought this would be a recurring thing of you dodging what you said you would do because it was uncomfortable. 

…and I was right, as much as I fucking wish I was not. And, six weeks late for however long it's been, you still haven't made that call. I messaged you thirty minutes ago, and you haven't replied. You've probably read that message, you've probably felt uncomfortable at it and ignored it and hoped it would just go away along with your guilt. You'll probably tell me you can't tomorrow because of work (nevermind that you finish at 4:30pm and you can call them after) and that you'll call them Wednesday. Wednesday will come around and if I try and follow up with you, you will get defensive and upset at me again. Thursday is our one year anniversary and I will probably put any resentment aside just so I, and you, can share a nice day together. I'm still looking forward to spending a nice day with you, I love your company and your smile and your heart and your silly sense of humour and how much fun we have together.

But your lack of action, your lack of commitment to improving a part of our relationship I have said is a huge issue to me, and your lack of integrity to your word to me is getting to be too much. I'm treading water and I don't know how much longer I can keep afloat. ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1e8jeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e8jeh/to_my_beautiful_girlfriend/,

After our last ""The Talk"" a few weeks ago, I really felt like things were getting better, but just wasn't sure I could trust the longevity of it.  **As small of a success as it may seem, we had sex at least once per week this month!**  After spending the first year of our marriage going anywhere from a month to two and a half in between, that's HUGE for me.  I've even turned him down a few times for various reasons, so probably could have done it even more.  

He's not only upped the sex part, but the general intimacy has gone up tenfold.  **While I'm loving the extra sex, the intimacy and passion has always been what has really been missing for me and I can honestly say I've been feeling consistently fulfilled over the last few weeks for longer than I have our entire marriage.**

I realized yesterday while driving somewhere that **I don't feel broken anymore.**

I know that it's only been a few weeks, but the turn-around has been incredible and I wanted to share with people who would understand what a huge deal this is.

I don't know how you guys feel about religion, but our therapist is a marriage/relationship/sex therapist and does things from the Christian perspective.  My husband listened to a couple of series from our church on his ipod a few weeks ago and said that after listening to those and discussions we had, things just really clicked into place about where he is psychologically and what effect that's having on me and our relationship.  **I know some people have had bad experiences with therapists, but I can't thank ours enough for the efforts he's made.**

**Assuming things continue to go well, I'd like to make a post with some of the things our therapist has shared with us** (none of what I was intent on saying has anything to do with religion, so it's not preachy, I promise), **as well as some of the things we tried along the way, as well as things I've said or he's said in ""talk""s that seemed to actually help rather than cause things to get worse.**  I don't know if it would help anyone else, but I know that I soak up anything anyone ever suggests in case it would help us, so maybe it could help point someone else in a good direction, as well.

Also...

**I also just wanted to say thank you to all of you guys.**  **Having this subreddit** be alive and filled with people working through the same things that I'm going through **has been an unbelievably tremendous help** in just keeping me sane. We all know how much DB issues can hurt and the way it can touch so many places in you (self esteem, self worth, etc) **and having a support group has been part of what's held me up through all of this - and what continues to help me through it all.**  So thank you guys!

Wandered over here to read about Star Wars, comics and other man-boy stuff.  Hit the Random button and found you guys by accident.  I must be officially old because THIS topic is worth creating an account about, especially since I have been in my own private hell these last years.  

I thought I was the only schlub with this problem.  One day of reading posts and comments and my future is set.  G_d bless each and every one of us!

For what it is worth, I've been in a faithful 19 yr relationship with the same girl.  Not married.  No kids.  I popped the question years ago and she said she wasn't ready - still in college - always something more important to do.  Whatever.  Then everyone in our circle of friends and family started getting divorced, which cooled all our jets.  Stories of going to court, fighting over kids and furniture, yadda yadda.  Everyone that ever said we were going to Hell for not being married or we were losers came back around to say how lucky we were for not being married. Honestly, because we were not married always kept me on my best behavior, but also actively interested in my SO well being.  Probably the first 5 yrs were terrific sexually- maybe until around the time(s) I proposed.  After that (in hindsight) our relationship became more about traveling and eating.  Over time you just get in a routine.  I probably did not want to have sex as much as she did not want to have sex.  Maybe once a month, but also there were times when it was several months between sexual outings.  

Maybe 6 years ago we made a big decision.  I basically left my banking career so she could pursue her career.  We moved to an isolated area with few opportunities for me, but it jump-started her salary and career by 10 years.  It was the right thing to do - for her.  And I was happy to make any sacrifice to please her.  All the while though sex became less of a priority for her.  After the move, I started thinking if sex was EVER a priority for her.  With the Depression and few local prospects, I struggled to keep my financial independence.  During this time she had some serious medical issues and I eventually liquidated my savings and retirement to meet those needs.  Again, I don't think I have any regrets in that.  During that time though, our sex life got worse, but again how can you ""force"" a ""sick"" person to have sex with you.  You don't even go there.  But it's also in this time that I started talking seriously about having kids - you start to feel your mortality. She says to this day she does too, but you have to have some sex to have kids.  It's almost like being sick was an excuse to avoid sex to avoid children.  Then she talks about getting married so we can adopt.  After all of this I don't think I am going to fall into that trap.  Anywho, we emerge from all that, but here we are 3 years into a ridiculous sexless roommate relationship - sex maybe once every six months - six months of begging.  

I was near penniless being underemployed for so long.  All attempts to get a well paying job at my partner's local office have failed largely because my partner is not much of an advocate for me at her place of work.  I can take a lot, but to take all of this AND get no sex out of it is too much.  Heck.  Forget sex, how about a freakin' hug?!

I think the first warning sign was the introduction of the ""cuddle pillow,"" those 6 ft long pillows you wrap your leg around while you sleep.  That thing wound up acting as a literal wall between us at night and a substitute me.  One funny/hurtful event was I started to snuggle up to her from behind and she quickly reaches down to her butt with one hand and pulls her cheeks apart and farts on me like a skunk would spray a wild animal.  I can't make that up.  They got to put that scene in a Julia Roberts movie.  Then and now it's very hurtful and shows an extreme lack of interest in intimacy. We talked and fought about this on and off for years.  She said; 'It's so easy for guys because you can just go into the bathroom and jerk off into the toilet.'  It's been 4 months since we had any sex.  She gets and orgasm.  I get one too. Then go shopping and talking endlessly about her work. I went through all the phases of thinking I was ugly, she was having an affair, she must be a lesbian.  Heck, maybe they are all true.  She has been to counseling over the years - lots of ""mom"" stuff to work on.  She's been on anti-depressants.  I have offered to go to counseling, but it seems that she just does not want me in that space.  

I lost almost 50 pounds in the last year, so I am getting down to my ass-kicker prime again.  Was it from stress or focusing on myself?  I started a business against all her wishes and it is now taking off.  I am getting my confidence back and financial independence.  I am ready to go live in the park with the squirrels rather than take all this abuse.

Now she is getting nervous, guilting me that I am going to leave her.  I say, I don't have to leave.  I just need some affection.  A warm smile and a little something something.  I have dental appointments that are more spontaneous than sex with her.  I still care for her as a person, but I can't do it to my detriment.  This is survival.

Frankly, I would not be ready to commit had I not found this simple site.  Thanks for letting me vent and I will update everyone as my plans become more concrete.  With a little luck I can eject from this prison planet and find some smart career woman in her mid 30's that wants some kids with me.  I'm a great catch after all!

i made a concerted effort to be welcoming and not think about all the years of rejection from him. i was honest and said i didn't think i would be able to jump right in, and suggested that if he wanted to have sex he might be best to focus on me first as he's shown no interest in me since our son was born. i'm glad he heeded my suggestion and i was able to forget about the past and just enjoy the fact my husband was making love to me.

for not having had sex for so long, it was surprisingly good and pleasurable. and when he whispered ""i love you"" in my ear during, well it brought tears because i never thought i would experience that again.

Sometimes, when I try to initiate things without words to my boyfriend, I grab his hands and put them on my boobs.  I never really thought about it as much until lately, but he's the only guy I've ever dated that hasn't been turned on by me forcing my boobs on him.
I realize one of the reasons I'm hurting myself, is by doing things that I should know are futile with my boyfriend. Like putting his hands on my boobs for the 50th time and expecting him to suddenly be more interested.
There are times where we will be at home or whatever and he will stand behind me and I'll back up and rub my ass against his crotch. He either laughs like its a joke or I get nothing. I feel like I'm a huge creep sometimes, man.

I stumbled across this group while looking for sex therapists and other resources in my area and am overwhelmed with the amount of people suffering from an issue I thought I was alone in. As I've been reading, I've found myself nodding along emphatically as my very own feelings were described by strangers.

We I started off with a long distance, almost exclusively sexual relationship. Mere weeks into it, the frequency was already beginning to dwindle, but not enough to give cause for concern. When we became serious and I relocated to be with him, the drastic change occurred. We had sex less and less until now, 3 years in, we're having sex once every 5 or 6 months and then only after I can't hold my tongue anymore or he's drunk. Other than the occasional peck, forehead kiss, or jokey boob squeeze, we have close to no physical contact outside of sex, either.
My sexual prowess was never something I was concerned about but in the course of our relationship he's (unintentionally) humiliated me several of the few times we have had sex and, after the first few weeks, rejected me every single time I've attempted to initiate. I never initiate anymore and have developed insecurities and inhibitions in the bedroom that I never had before. I feel unattractive, unfeminine and unwanted.
I've tried to have conversations about the issue many times but he immediately gets defensive and we always end up arguing and resolving nothing. It always ends with him making empty promises to ""do something about it"" just to appease me and get me to shut up, usually followed by a half hearted attempt at sex (no foreplay and a rush to finish with no regard as to whether I'm actually enjoying it).
I've always had a HL but I've reached a point where all I think about is sex, all day, every day. I masturbate almost compulsively, several times a day, and even then am rarely sated.
In all other aspects, our relationship is amazing and there is no part of me that wants to break up but when I entered this relationship, I wasn't looking for a platonic bff. At least with a bff I'm allowed to have sex with SOMEONE. As things are now, I feel as if I'm condemning myself to a life of rejection and perpetual loneliness. While sex is not the only important thing in a relationship, to me it is one of the most important. Without it, we're just close friends who live together.

We have been married over 16 years. She has put on weight over that time until she is now 100 lbs overweight. I have tried to help - family gym membership, joining a Biggest Losers competition at church, discussions about OUR health and why we should try to be healthy for our children. Nothing has worked. She told me that she feels self-conscious about the gym so I drop $1000 on a home elliptical; she used it twice and now it just sits there. We did Biggest Loser and she LOVES to volunteer to help at the church to do weigh-ins but she then doesn't lose weight herself and quits. Friday she had a pain in her chest (which I think was gas) but it was enough for us to talk seriously about health (I always talk about OUR health, not just hers); she agreed that she needs to start trying - this weekend she just laid in bed watching Netflix and didn't touch the elliptical once. 

Over the past year or so I've finally realized that I'm not sexually attracted to her anymore. She's stunningly beautiful but she has killed any sort of attraction by piling on weight. She will spend an hour each morning in front of the mirror to do her hair and her makeup but won't spend 15 minutes on exercise. The fact that she has given up has caused me to finally give up. At this point we're just pals who live together. If it wasn't for my two teenage kids I'd probably move out. I'm only in my early 40s and I can't stand to think of living the rest of my life without being sexually attracted to my mate. I thought of cheating but that would only bring her pain which she doesn't deserve, guilt to me, and I don't want to imagine if my kids found out. I'm at a complete loss. 

Add to this, the fact that I don't find her sexually attractive has caused me to start giving up on myself. I think ""Why should I try to make myself look good? For who? It doesn't make her try, I'm not going to go out and pick up women. So why try?""

And recently she saw pictures of herself from family photos. She said that she actually cried because she was so ashamed. This was why we went and bought an elliptical together. Since then it's been used twice. I thought this was the breakthrough that was needed. It wasn't.

I just wanted to drop in and say hi to all of you. I dealt with a DedBedroom marriage for 17 years; issues started almost immediately after marriage. I was in perfect physical condition (was a soldier), both were young, hot, and the sex went from terrible to non-existent within the first 3 years of marriage. 

Over time the emotional damage that was done to me by the constant rejection, changed my whole personality, it made me more miserable that I even knew at the time... It destroyed my self-image, my confidence, (My ex-wife used to tell me that my penis was too small (7.75in) to get her off, and a whole host of other deflections that made it my fault) It just crushed me. A slow but steady degrading, which over time I started to believe completely. I gave up, not just on sex, but on happiness. 

I got fat, lazy, and at times, mean. I was just so angry and full of resentment, I was miserable, but I loved my ex-wife while we were married. I was emotionally manipulated into always trying to make her happy just for a scrap of affection, or sexual contact. I thought the world of her, and would of never left her. (crazy i know)

Eventually she cheated, and it was just too much. The betrayal just pushed me over the edge and we got a divorce. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me. It has taken a few years to make real progress in my recovery, but I have slowly built myself back up, got my confidence back, got my physical health back, met a great girl, and finally have a great Marriage. 

To this day I still have some issues left over from my DB experience; I am very touchy about my wife's sexual past, (yes I know it shouldn't matter to me, but it does... I am working on it.); It has taken me a bit to find my confidence around my body (penis), and I am SUPER sensitive to any form of rejection.... a simple ""Can we make love in the morning babes, I am just wiped out from my day at work"" (She always makes good on it) feels like I knife in the heart at times.... but my general happiness, my level of connection with my wife, my satisfaction with life is so much better, I honestly didn't know life could be this great.

I tell all of you this because there IS life after DB. There is hope, and I highly recommend that you do your best to fix your situation, and if you cannot fix it, if your DB partner is un-willing, leave, take responsibility for your own needs and happiness and get out there and find it. Life is too short to live that way. 

Much love for you all.

This is a well-known and understood component of monagamy. What I propose, though, and what I think is not an unreasonable or groundbreaking concept, is that monogamy also states that each spouse actually DOES engage in sexual activity with his or her spouse.

What this means is that if you're not cheating, that's only part of your responsibility as a member of a monogamous pair-bond. The other part of your responsibility as a member of a monogamous pair-bond is to also have sex with your partner. How often? I don't think most people would think every day is a necessity, but certainly it should be more often than once a month, particularly for married couples who do not have children.

That's me and my wife. Married for a couple months, been living together for two years, and she puts out once a month if I'm lucky. That's not okay. If I bring it up, she cries and apologizes profusely, but it never changes. Therapy is not an option (we are too poor to afford it). I'm not asking for advice. I'm sharing this information for any women out there who think their relationship is fine because their partner isn't cheating on them and doesn't complain at them.

Here's the thing: we stay with you, even though we're not getting sex nearly often enough. Do you know why we stay? Because we love you like crazy. That is, we love you to distraction -- the way you brush your hair in the morning, the smile you make when you wake up, the funny things you say, and the way you support us through our challenges. Those wedding vows were serious, and we take them seriously. All we ask is that you pull it together once or twice a week to pretend to be interested in having sex.

We're also not asking you to just lie there like bib lettuce while we do our thing. We know what makes you tick, and likely as not if you just give us a chance, we're going to get your motor going. So just give us that chance! Pretend to be interested, give us five or ten minutes to see if we can get you in the mood. Please.

Success story!,37,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/u9stk/update_to_my_original_deadbedroom_post_a_couple/,"I randomly stumbled into this sub a few months ago via a random comment somewhere else and, as I noted in my original post, the timing was perfect. 

My post was the typical ""Married for a few years with a three kids, no sex or even affection but the mechanical kind and in single digits over almost two years.""

The pattern was the same up until a few weeks ago. My wife and I attended a friend's destination wedding down in the Caribbean for an extended weekend vacation; our first vacation without kids in 5 years. Just the two of us; no kids, computers or cell phones. 

When my in-laws dropped us off at the airport to depart it was like a weight lifted off our shoulders instantly. We talked to each other differently, helped each other differently. Everything was just relaxed. 

Fast forward to two days into the trip and we are back in our room after a full day of drinks and sun on the beach, getting ready to meet the rest of the group that came down for dinner. She showered first and was doing make-up etc while I hopped in the shower. I come out, she's laying on the bed in her dress for the evening and towel around her head...fast asleep. In my towel, I walk over and tell her we're going to be late and give her just a quick, random kiss on the lips. As I pull away we make eye contact, I kiss her again and BOOM! 

We haven't had sex like that in years, even back when we were having regular sex.  

We missed dinner completely and ended up reshowering and catching up to the group later that night. Sex a couple more times on the trip and a few times since the trip and we're a completely different couple, both in and out of the bedroom, physically and emotionally. 

We've talked and both decided that it's absolutely necessary for us to take a true break from the kids at least once a year for even just one weekend, just so we can be who we fell in love with before kids. It doesn't have to be to the Caribbean, but just something that reminds us that we're adults and that our core is still around somewhere. 

We've also decided that we're absolutely done having kids and plan on making it truly permanent soon. After our third kid she wanted to wait for a little while yet because she was indecisive as to how many kids she really wanted. We've always tossed around the 3 and 4 numbers. I've been ready to throw in the towel after a few months with three in the house, but she was hesitant on waiting a bit longer. 

She admitted that even with an IUD she was still quite nervous about getting pregnant again, to the point where she could only think about getting pregnant when having sex which completely turned her off. Once she came to the realization of how much she didn't want to get pregnant again, she realized it was time to make it official. 

The big V will be sometime this fall, and I can't wait. 

**TL;DR** - Took a vacation, reconnected as ""husband and wife"" rather than ""parents"" and had crazy sex for two hours instead of attending a groom's dinner, and things are looking great at home on many levels.

I (30 w) will not leave my (33 m) husband. We have two happy, well-adjusted kids, we laugh all the time, support each other, are physically affectionate, and still very much in love. 

He is very happy with sex once a month, maybe twice if the kids are distracted enough for a 5 minute fumble in the morning. His pride gets wounded if I try to talk directly about anything to do with our sex life, and we end up even less likely to have sex.

I won't look outside the marriage for intimacy because I still deeply respect him as my partner, and as pathetic as it sounds, he's the only man I want or desire.

The worst part is the sex is so fucking good when it happens. Well, the foreplay is. Because he doesn't masturbate a lot he ejaculates after only a minute or two of PIV. I try to encourage him to masturbate more, but he says he's just really happy and satisfied with what he's currently getting.

*But I'm not.* 

I feel physically sick when I read comments online about women who have a higher libido than their partners. We must be unattractive/naggers/nymphos, or the men must be gay. 

Like many of you, I can't even initiate anymore. The rejection is too painful. I sometimes read stories that one of you have shared and I just weep that you are with her and he is with me. Why couldn't I have found a 'normal' man? How on earth did a woman who would happily have sex twice a day end up loving a man who is happy with once every ~3 weeks?

He had already let me know his ideas about cat custody, in fact.  Recently he had promised me ""some adult time"" on a particular evening--halfhearted gesture?  Whatever.  By the time he got home from work that evening, I had been crying for about 40 minutes--went through the whole gamut of feeling ignored, disregarded, disrespected, sorry for myself/angry beyond measure, etc.  

But it was different this time because I had recently had an incredible--and almost satiating--sexual encounter with another man, so that that feeling of intense sexual need was mostly quelled for once.  (Details can be viewed in the Brooklyn subreddit--look for NSFW Followup to 43year old woman post.). 

Basically because that source of my anger towards him had been (temporarily) taken care of, I was able to sit through his stonewalling, accusations, denial, etc. patiently enough that we could really talk to each other.  We wound up talking for about an hour and a half and he finally,  finally started to spill his guts.  And we held onto each other and sobbed for awhile.  And he agreed to go to counseling to try to salvage the situation.

The next day he asked me to come to the bedroom with him.  I wasn't about to get myself too excited, but I joined him.  And he said, ""So 
teach me how to help you have an orgasm.""  Let me tell you, I was stunned.  The whole encounter went better than expected in that we were really able to communicate with each other, for once.

Hoping that it continues on like this; definite new direction/glimmer of hope for my marriage, as I really don't want to wind up divorced.

He had it in a penis pump, I'm guessing to make it tighter?  We only have sex twice a month if I'm lucky.  I have posted in this sub before, but this kind of changes things.  I thought he had become LL but if he's masturbating with this thing, I think not.  I have told him I would like to have sex more.  I have said this in the past too.  We had sex 2 days in a row last month and that was great.  I thought it was going to turn around.  I wait and wait and give hints and nothing.  We had sex the other day only because I said he could stick it in my ass.  I'm on my period right now and I do enjoy anal.  I don't know how to approach him to talk about his masturbation habits.  I thought about putting a note on it saying something like ""You should probably just fuck me.""  or something and have him come to me.  Also, a comment he had made months ago made me feel really insecure about my tightness.  I surprised him when he got off work and we got to it.  I could hear him getting frustrated and say ""can't you make your pussy tighter!?""  He then puts his pants on and watches tv.  I have since bought lelo beads and different kegel aids and used them for a while.  I have gotten pretty good at kegels now. He never said anything different, telling me I feel good or anything like that.  Also, to top things off, we are getting married in 2 months.

My bf and I have been together for two years now. Same old story - we had lots of sex in the beginning and it was awesome! Then along the way I changed jobs and had a shitty schedule for a while so the sex dropped a bit, but I figured things would pick up... they did for maybe a month, and then he started taking antidepressants, and I'm sure you all can guess what happened next. His libido *completely* tanked. I tried to be patient, because I care about him and his mental health is important. After about a month of absolutely no sex I finally couldn't take it anymore and I let on how frustrated I was getting. He hadn't even realized it had been a month.

The talk didn't really resolve anything other than him being sorry, but still not making any attempt to do... anything. So I continue to try and be patient. We very occasionally have sex and it's not very satisfying when we do, for the most part. Feels like he's not really into it, basically.

Finally he goes off his antidepressants and his libido slowly starts to return! *Huzzah!* However, we have sex a couple times and it's apparent a new problem has arisen - he is now experiencing premature ejaculation, for the first time. Okay, it sucks, but I figure we just keep at it and eventually things will return to normal! I'm honestly not that bothered by it, and I'm just happy we're doing it again. 

But no, that's not how it goes... instead he just gets embarrassed and we go back to no sex. I try to talk with him and explain that I really don't care and I just miss the intimacy, and that I would be happy enough if he just pleasured me in other ways if he finishes prematurely. I try to bring up the topic of buying a vibrator for him to use on me to help me finish off. I think it would be fun and sexy anyway regardless of the PE problem, and I tell him this. He gets all weird about it anyway and harshly tells me that if I want to buy a vibrator I should just go do that with my girlfriends and he doesn't see why he needs to buy it with me. He obviously just doesn't want to talk about it at all so I give up.

I should also mention that we have both been experiencing a lot of stress for the past couple months, mostly relating to finances. When I get stressed I try and enjoy the small things in life, so I just want to have sex even more to de-stress. He thinks of it as too much pressure and just shuts down. The other thing is he does have some health problems that mean he has low energy or doesn't feel good sometimes. I am very understanding of the days when he's feeling bad because of it.

We've only had sex a handful of times this year. I haven't had an orgasm that wasn't self-induced for at least two months, maybe longer. I've been masturbating like 2 times a day but I'm still so unsatisfied, and every time I do it I feel more frustrated. It barely even takes the edge off. At this point it's everything I can do not to start crying whenever I feel the slightest sexual urge. When I see a link or comment about sex on reddit I scroll past because it hurts too much to read about other people's enjoyment of it. It doesn't help that absolutely none of my friends have experienced this before, so when I've tried to talk about it all I hear is stuff like; ""What, you guys haven't had sex in HOW long? Man, I would be sooo frustrated!"" and every time I hear something like that it makes me feel even more lonely.


The worst part is? This isn't my first dead bedroom. My ex boyfriend of 9 months was my first and only sexual partner, and he also took antidepressants that killed his libido early-on in the relationship. I had to basically beg him to even take my virginity, and it got to the point where I was standing in front of him in a corset and he just ignored me to play minecraft. He got angry with me when I tried to initiate sex.This continued until he dumped me. 


So basically, with the exception of the first part of my relationship with the current bf, I've essentially *never* had a lasting, enjoyable sex life. I've had a high libido ever since I was a teenager, and used to dream of all the wonderful sex I would have one day. Now I'm turning 23 in a month and I'm starting to feel afraid that things will never improve, and as I get older my libido will drop without me ever getting to experience that joy. That's probably one of my biggest fears right now.

I am so, so disappointed, and I am starting to feel very resentful towards my boyfriend. He has made some effort - I don't want this post to seem like he hasn't tried at all. Any time we've talked he does feel genuinely sorry try to implement something, but it seems like he just gets discourages or some new stress in life comes up and then he gives up again... and the bitterness just grows and grows. I can't help but think every time I go to masturbate that he just doesn't care about my pleasure. He's said that he does and it seemed like he meant it, but then I think well, you obviously don't care enough or you'd be fucking *doing* something about it. It feels like he's just avoiding the problem because of his own feelings of shame or whatever, and I am running out of sympathy. It's not like I'm begging for sex every other day - I've *barely* mentioned it. I've been extremely patient. So why can't he just be selfless, go out and buy a vibrator and use it on me? I am the type of person who if the roles were reversed would be pleasuring my bf in other ways, even if I wasn't in the mood for sex. (In fact, I've done so before with my ex.)

Last month we average about 3 times a week. Considering we used to have 2-3 month dry spells at a time this is pretty huge. 

The other night I was on the computer and my wife caught me looking at porn. (The ironic part - I was only looking at it to delete it. As many of you may know I've been working on giving up porn). She was disturbed by this - back in our heyday she was never bothered by porn. We used to watch it together. I asked what was wrong - she said that she had been working on changing and felt like she'd made good progress, but despite that here I was looking at porn. It made her feel inadequate, like she wasn't good enough. My response - *Of course you aren't.*

...Let me explain. I told her that while I was thrilled about the progress we'd been making, there were still a lot of areas left to be desired. You can't hit me with a laundry list of things you can't or don't want to do and expect me to be 100% fulfilled by that. I'm not going to lie to massage your insecurities.

The next day we were all over each other, which lead to some pretty hot and heavy sex when the kids took an afternoon nap. We haven't had sex like that since the first couple months of dating. It was...intense. Since the DB started she's hit me with the insecurities before but this was the first time I actually called her out on them.

The following day no sex (which was fine by me), but I tried to take the opportunity to talk about blowjobs. She never gives them voluntarily, I always have to ask and then she does so reluctantly for maybe 5 minutes before asking ""Can I stop now?"" I asked what I could do to make them more enjoyable for her, make her want to do it. She gave me a short list of conditions I would have to fulfill for her to consider it. I said I would do what I could to create an ideal environment for her, but I pointed out that this wasn't exactly fair - I didn't have a list of conditions for her, wasn't holding her to the same standard. She started to get defensive and accused me of only caring about sex and our talks lately revolving around sex. I called her on that - right now our only issue is sex so if that's solved then it won't come up. And we'd gone the entire weekend talking about all sorts of things - it was only here at the very end that we talked about sex. And if you want me to be happy with you, you have to step up to the plate. I told her I would not press the issue any further, but she's an adult and I've made my position clear. 

So we'll see what happens from here. My reason for sharing this story - I think the time for walking on eggshells with our LL partners is past. We need to be direct, honest, and frank with them. If they give you that whole ""is sex that important to you?"" rebuttal, look them in the eye and say ""yes, yes it is."" If they start getting insecure and mopey about not being good enough, don't coddle them. Say ""no, you're not. But here's how you can be, and here's how I'm willing to help.""

Many also recommend couples counseling or individual therapy.  However, I read so many pain-filled, desolate posts behind throwaway accounts that always end up ""He/She doesn't understand and won't talk to me about this!  Help!""

This isolation that the couple builds for themselves, not being willing to ask for help or even speak to each other is one of the base reasons for a Dead Bedroom.  A lack of trust and communication leads to misunderstanding, isolation and resentment.  Finally, in miserable desperation, one partner finally posts here.  

The first post, giving all the gory details that we've all seen (and lived) so many times leads to the usual suggestions of trying to have The Talk, suggestions for therapy and checking the chemicals of birth control, depression medication, etc.  Sometimes we'll even have some back and forth with the poster.  But it seems very, very rare for the poster to show their SO what they have done.

I think that is a badly missed opportunity most of the time.

Going on to the internet, creating an account on a message board and airing the misery and hopelessness of their DB for all here to see should shock many SOs.  I believe that shock value could be a good thing, if managed well.  ""See what you've driven me to do"" is exactly the wrong way to bring up the Reddit conversation.  More along the lines of ""Honey, there are a lot of people struggling with the exact same problem that we do.  Look what so many of them say.  C'mon, let's read this and talk this out.""

This sub is a support group.  I would love to come here one day and not see another new post, meaning there aren't DBs floating around Reddit anymore.  But because that won't ever happen, how can we be more effective?  Working with just one half of a DB helps that person feel less isolated.  There are others willing to give advice and cheering your relationship on, hoping that you will find a solution (that many of us never did with our DB partners).  We want to see your relationships get better.  So....show your SO what you've written, and what we've said.  Don't continue the charade of isolation.

1366936283.0,31,self.DeadBedrooms,1d4dqa,How worried should I be?,35,4,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1d4dqa/how_worried_should_i_be/,"I really need your advice and assessment of my situation.  Am I overreacting or is my situation going to keep getting worse and worse (which is what I am afraid of)?

Here are the basics: I am 35 and my wife and I have three young kids (4.5, 3 and 10 months).   I love my wife and am pretty confident she loves me, but thinks have changed dramatically in the bedrooms since our youngest child was born.  We have gone from husband and wife to roommates who get a long really well and raise kids together.

Our sex life slowed down after the birth of our first two, but has been pretty much non-existant since our youngest has been born.  Usually, after she gives birth, I don't approach her for at least 3 months and things ususally pick up after 6 months (once a week which is a less than I wanted, but would love that now).  Well, no so much with the youngest.  We have sex once a month and it is total pity sex (which is really depressing).  

Let's face it; 3 kids under the age of 5 is really intense and she is REALLY tired at the end of the day.  I totally get that.   That being said, sex needs to be a priority in our marriage.  I am really worried that we are falling off a cliff and headed towards once or twice a year.  I can't and won't live like that.

A few other things to help frame the situation:
1) My wife is gorgeous.  Hot!  You would never believe she has three children.  I would jump her bones every day if I could.  She feels secure in her body and I am in good shape (i.e. I am still the same weight and build from when we ment) so I think she should still be realatively attracted to me.
2) This is not just about sex.  I masturbate if I need to, but I truly miss the intamacy of being together.
3) It is like her sex drive has completley shut off.  I cannot get her interested in any way.  Sorry to get graphic, but I used to be able to stimulate her with my fingers or by going down on her.  She used to love oral sex.  Now if I offer she pulls me up.  Not interested.  She says she can't get into it.  It is mechanical and joyless for her and leaves me feeling like a total loser.
4)  We have talked about it and she blames it on being tired.  At first, believe me, I got it.  It is hard being with three little ones all day!  After the 30th time, I turned it to me (it must be my fault).   She recommended I do things to help her relax, make it special, etc.   I turned it up a notch for a few months.  I would take all three kids when I got home from work, bathe them and get them put to bed while she relaxed and drank a glass of wine and did emails, etc.  I would give her massages and not try to make a move on her (very hard by the way) to show that it is not just about sex.   Despite all of this, it has just gotten worse.

So here is my basic question: Am I just being an impatient prick? It has only been 10 months since our third child.  Will she bounce back once the kids are a little older?  How often is reasonable for people in our situation?  I don't even know what normal is, but I know that I am not happy and am fearful of becoming misareable and then having it turn towards resentment.......and further down the hill we tumble....

Help!! I need some good advice.

I used the example of being offered cheesecake.

But then I got to thinking - what if I was being offered cheesecake everyday? The first few days or weeks would be great, but after awhile I imagine I'd get kind of burned out on it. Knowing that the cheesecake was available whenever I wanted it I'd probably start turning it down, only opting to eat it when I really craved cheesecake. I do like cheesecake, but really I would only really crave it maybe 2 or 3 times a month.

Huh. That sounds kind of familiar. 

So for a moment there I felt like I understood how the LL side feels. Since sex is always on the table, they can say ""only when I feel like it"" and get away with it. They don't burn out on it and they get to have it exactly on their terms.

Though this doesn't apply to me personally, I know for a lot of guys part of the excitement of sex is the thrill of the chase. Though different I think a similar dynamic exists for women as well - she can use her sexuality to charm him and keep him around. For us long-term couples though, there's no more chase and no more trying to charm someone into sticking around. 

So perhaps by being so available to our partners we're inadvertently helping contribute to the dead bedroom. I know for some LL partners if we were to stop asking for sex they'd be okay with never having it again and relieved to no longer have to deal with it. So this doesn't apply to them so much. More for those of us who have partners who are receptive and do enjoy it 1-2x a month but nothing more. 

And even coming to this thought though, I have no idea how to go about fixing it. Some of you may remember from my previous posts that I stopped expecting sex earlier this year from my wife. Stopped talking about it, stopped trying. She noticed and this has started to bother her. Lately she's been making an effort to be more affectionate and will even tell me a day when she's up for sex. We're still miles away from where I'd like to be but at least she's making an effort. I can't say though that turning the tables on her has been effective. Still a work in progress.

I decided that i had enuff and that I held a lot of responsibility for the situation so i began to change-here's a few things i did to restart things. I began to look at my wife as a sexual being-I started to notice her body and started to change my self talk from-shes a mother to shes a sexy lady. I then began to show her i thought she was sexy by chasing her again-i'd walk up and stroke her often-kiss the back of her neck, just be close to her-when she did something that bothered me i wouldn't think twice instead of saying god i hate that id think man that was so cute. 

I then began to lust after her and would tell her god i think you're so sexy-do you know i have even taken your panties from the wash and played with them cause i find you so attractive and sexy-(she found this very flattering and sexy-i'd even let her catch me with them and that turned into one of the best fulfilled fantasies ever) 

We then began to go to sex stores to buy nice outfits and some toys (the investment that keeps on giving). I asked her to leave me her panties once in awhile and it's always very sexy to find a pair on my pillow. 

Well she started warming up and now i have awoken the beast lol-we have the best times of our lifes now-we tell each other things we never would have ever thought to talk about-we discuss fantasies and we role play. 

I realized it took stopping my internal complaining about her and our situation and changing it to positive self talk that started my journey. It has been incredibly rewarding-she has come full circle as have I-I lust after her constantly and she will sometimes come home at lunch just to jump me and play-or she'll attack me in the funniest places. I think that instead of becoming complacent with the situation you have to become that ""take charge kind of guy"" she met and just start communicating and the hell with what happens-we get too worried about weather or not our partners will think we are perverted or stupid-if you step out on that ledge either she will push you off or she will pull you back-either way you will know where you stand.

1337041632.0,30,self.DeadBedrooms,tnch3,Lost....Just lost.,40,10,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/tnch3/lostjust_lost/,"Almost 20 years ago, when my wife and I started dating, I was all set to accept a job in a small town.  I would have loved the job.  However, it became clear to me that she did not want to live there, as she had no experience in a small town and would not have had a job there.  I also loved her.  

So without thinking about it I agreed we should move to the city in which she wanted to live.  Because I had no connections there, it took me several years to find a job in my profession.  In the meantime I did every other kind of odd job.

Flash forward several years.  We were both working in our fields.  Because her career got started a lot earlier than mine, she earned a lot more than I did.  But finally I'd gotten my career started, so that was all I cared about.

We were happy.  Physically we were good and affectionate.  We talked, we joked, we had good times.  When we finally got serious about trying to have children, I realized I didn't know how to raise them in the city.  Because I'd given so many years to her to live where she wanted, I approached her about moving outside the city.  We talked, and she agreed that we could start looking.

For the next few years, we looked at a couple of hundred houses (no exaggeration).  None were good enough for her.  We also had our first child.

I don't remember the circumstances any more, but it finally became obvious to me that she did not want to move, that she never had wanted to move, and that for all those years she had been, in effect, lying to me about it while I worked hard to find an alternative living arrangement she would like.

For the first time ever in my relationship with her, I realized that she never had thought of me as a person or what I would want; instead she always had considered me in terms of how I could help her get what she wanted.  For example, I waited to propose to her until I finally got a job in my profession.  But because my other jobs had been so trivial, I couldn't afford a fancy ring.  Shortly after I gave her what I could afford, she had her mom buy her a fancy engagement ring.

I realize that makes her sound bad, but she is not bad.  She is a funny, smart, good person.  I just don't think she ever had been asked to consider someone else's interests instead of her own.  For instance, she told me, after the arguments began, that she always simply had thought that I wanted what she wanted.

Anyway, when I realized this about her--that she viewed me only as a cipher, someone who could help her achieve what she wanted--the arguments became enormous.  Monumental.  Honestly I kept my tongue (it's probably the only reason I still can like myself today), but she did not.  She said every kind of vicious thing imaginable.  I think this was because, as I say, she never had been confronted with her own fundamental selfishness before.  

It was as though she blamed me for being hurt by her disinterest in what I might want.  And, to some extent, I can see why she would feel that way.  After all, I was the one who'd changed the terms on her.  I was the one who'd asked to move out of the city.

But she also said other things. For example, she told me, during an argument, that I would want alimony from her.  This made me realize that all the years in which I'd struggled to get my career started, struggles I'd faced because I'd given up on my job so many years ago in an attempt to make her happy, she'd viewed me merely as a sponge.  She hadn't seen sacrifice.  She'd seen an underpaid apparently valueless companion who wanted her to support him.  

Which isn't to say anything bad about alimony; it's a useful tool for certain spouses.  But accepting it would have been the furthest thing from who I was.  That realization, that she'd never seen who I was, made all the other tumblers click, made me realize what I said above about my being important to her only to the extent that I let her follow her dreams.  It also was the exact moment at which I felt my love for her die.

We have been together for *years* since then.  We don't argue.  We're civil for the most part to each other.  We talk about our children and the many tactical details of filling their needs.  We don't touch.  We don't kiss.  We don't say I love you.  We haven't had sex in almost 4 years.  We pour our emotions into our relationships with our children.

Truthfully I can't imagine how we'll ever get from where we are now to where we might be intimate--physically or emotionally--again.  But then I couldn't have imagined before all of this happened that my simple desire to move out of the city would have caused this kind of rift.

We stay together, obviously, for our 2 children.  I know, I know, that's not a good reason.  For what it's worth, I do believe it some day would be a surprise to them to learn about what has happened.  Many parents are not that affectionate in front of their children.  We have masked it well.  

But also, more importantly, there is a certain kind of person for whom divorce is not an option.  To whom every promise made is a promise to be kept.  I long ago, during this, asked myself if I were the kind of person who kept my promises or not.  I know what my answer is.

I have left some out, including the nightmare of a renovation we finally underwent, and what that did to our relationship.  

But I don't see how how anything I did during all of this was wrong.  I tried hard in every instance to do the right thing, to speak softly and kindly.  To not attack.  To, honestly and sincerely, sacrifice.  But at this point it's not a question of blame.  It's a question of how to continue in the years I have left with an emotional void in my heart.

Went to counselling, got a little better for a while, then backslid and just finished another yr. drought. A couple of weeks ago I mentioned that we needed to talk about our mis-matched libidos problem. Last night I asked her since she's had a couple of weeks to think about it, what her thoughts were about how we should handle it. She said ""Well, we could have sex if you want, but I'm just not into it. It's not something I want to do. I know that's unfair to you, but that's the way it is."" I let that comment lay there for a couple of minutes, realizing that she acknowledged that it's unfair and getting up the nerve to make a now-or-never move, then told her that yes, it certainly didn't sound too inspiring. Then I said ""I've never cheated on you, and I don't want to divorce you, but since we're at an impasse, how would you feel about me as discreetly as I know how seeking sex outside our marriage? I'd never throw it up in your face, the object would be for you to never even know anything about it."" She looked at me and said ""Go for it. I can't give you what you want, and I can't make it financially through a divorce, so sure, go ahead. It's not like this hasn't been done in other marriages."" I think we were both so relieved, that there's been a noticeable lightening of the mood around the house last night and today. The resentment is gone on my part, because now it's up to me whether I get laid. The pressure is off her, because she knows sex isn't expected of her anymore. For now divorce isn't looming like an unspoken goblin over our heads, and I don't think it will make a comeback. Other than the sex issue, we get along pretty well. Neither one of us wanted to put our kids, even though they're grown, through a divorce. And we have a good time when we're with them, when we're travelling, and we're heading into a period when our finances should lighten up a bit. So now with the sexual issue resolved between us, things feel a lot better. And, unlike a couple of recent posts, I won't feel like I'm cheating!

Sex was nonstop and exciting in the beginning, of course. Our sexual compatibility was a big factor in my being interested in actually having a serious relationship. I'm usually pretty adverse to such a commitment in my current life situation (school, moving around more, etc.)

Anyway, about a year in things became kind of stale. Sex less and less. I didn't say anything for months, thinking it was stress or seasonal or something. 

Then I brought it up, trying to be helpful. She felt guilty and was sorry, but was vague about what was happening.

A month or two later, with things only worse, we started to resent each other, fighting here and there. I was convinced she was cheating on me, that she didn't want sex with me because she was having it with someone else, so I became paranoid.

I tried all kinds of things: I gained 10-15lbs of upper body muscle, I would be very close or elusive, talk about it, not talking about it, being romantic and spontaneous, attempting to initiate it, never attempting. Nothing ever helped, it only got worse.  She never told me how she felt or what was wrong except one drunken fight where she just said 'I don't want to have sex with you.'  But we were drunk so I try not to put too much into that.

Anyway, for New Years we go on a trip together to see her aunt, stay in a motel. Early 20s, in our own motel for a week, it should be a love fest, right? Here she's conceding some guilty feeling sex. It feels obligatory. She's very distant, and I return to the height of my paranoia about her cheating on me, so I look at her phone.

I see that she's texting and calling this guy from her university whenever I'm out of the room or asleep. He's totally her type too: brown hair, big nose, speaks a bit of french, blah blah. Anyway it's heartbreaking but I don't bring it up until we're back home.  She basically just says that she's sorry for hurting me, but nothing affirmative about her not having feelings for this guy.

At this point I decide that I'm not going to let myself continue being this paranoid, insecure monster that I've been becoming. So I'm talking to a friend about breaking up with her, and he reminds me that I've never really articulated clearly that this is a dealbreaker, just that I want more intimacy. So we have another talk and I tell her that she has to work with me to solve this or tell me that we're just simply physically incompatible. 

Next day she tells me that she had in fact been intimate with this other guy, so I broke it off. I thought it would be easier than this, but god it still hurts like hell. I loved that girl. I suppose it hasn't even been a week yet so it's probably too soon to say that kind of thing.

Either the lower libido partners submit to our demands at the cost of their own enjoyment and we complain that the sex is awful, or they fail to meet our frequency requirements and we assume (perhaps wrongly) that they aren't making an effort.  Compromise is mandatory.

Definitions:

Natural arousal interval - The time it takes for a person to become receptive to the idea of sex but not necessarily seek it out.  This assumes there are no external issues causing low libido.

Maximum tolerable interval - The absolute longest we're willing to go without sex with our partners.  This is subjective for the most part.

So how do we know if our expectations of our partners are reasonable?   If our maximum tolerable interval is is shorter than our partner's natural arousal interval, it's not going to work.  This doesn't mean we are too demanding or our partners are neglecting us, it just means it's unreasonable for us to expect our partners to meet our needs because they're not equipped for the task.  We should consider this an irreconcilable difference.

This is the how I look at it anyway.  For the record, I'm currently enjoying a single 1 to 2 hour encounter on the weekend, and while I could easily go everyday, I'm reasonably satisfied with the quantity.  The quality is the highest it's been in years.

I know I should GTFO, but I cannot because of our son - he's the best thing thats ever happened to me and I cannot bear to be away from him.

Married for 8 years. We have had sex exactly 15 times, all in the course of 2 months when we were trying to conceive (about 6 years into our marriage). ZERO sex before - yes you heard right. 6 years into our marriage we had not had sex. She was afraid of the pain (she was a virgin.) and would resist. I did not want to rape her obviously. She does not want to seek professional help nor go into counselling. Son's about 16 months old now. No chance of sex any time soon. The 15 times we had sex, it was terrible - like she was doing it just to get a baby. We don't sleep in the same room any more. She's off to sleep before I get home. I sleep in my room and she and my son in her. And then morning comes and I go to work and she looks after my son. We're a little more than roommates.

We used to get along well before despite the 6 years no-sex. And then now I just cannot get over the rejection in the bedroom. I hate her. I fantasize about punching her. I cannot hold a conversation with her without thinking about the way that she has tortured me these past few years. She feels _no_ remorse, no guilt, nothing. Like its normal to be living like this. And its not like she wants a divorce or to separate or anything.

Funny thing is we experimented sexually (barring penetration) a fair bit before marriage. It was great. So it seemed like she had a healthy sex drive. But I don't know what happened after.

Anyway, like I said, I have nobody to rant to about this to, so am ranting here. I'm going to go crazy soon I'm sure - I'm sinking.

I am twenty-seven, she is twenty-six; we had been together for six years. Unlike other relationships I've read about on this subreddit that start off with a bang and fizzle out, the sexual connection simply never existed for us. I am a very passionate and affectionate person, and I was crazy about her. She simply could not reciprocate those feelings. We eventually went to sex therapy, but this only made it more obvious that she did not feel anything sexually towards me. 

As you can imagine, lack of intimacy and constant rejection ate away at me, until eventually I realized that no matter how much I loved her and wanted it to work between us, we were just different people with different needs. I could not see myself being happy with her twenty or thirty years from now if nothing changed. And how could I expect it to change? I had done everything within my power to improve the relationship, to the point of proposing to her. Eventually I realized that if moving in together didn't change anything, getting engaged didn't change anything, why would getting married be any different? 

I understand that relationships are never perfect, that they are about compromise, but at some point you have to assess whether you are compromising your happiness. In sex therapy, I learned that no-sex relationships are not one partner's fault; rather, both partners are at fault. We had been in a vicious cycle of me wanting sex so badly, her feeling pressured, her giving me pity sex, me feeling awful about it. So I would stop pressuring her, lay off completely, only to go for a month or so without sex, until it was obvious that I wanted it, so she would give me pity sex, and I would feel awful about it, and on and on.

So I ended it. It was a very difficult decision, but ultimately I am confident it was the right one. Or at least I tell myself that. I am terrified that I will never find someone whom I love as much as I loved her. I've obviously had regrets. But my biggest regret, looking back, is that I let the relationship go on for so long, knowing in my heart it was wrong. My lack of strength to leave earlier in the relationship lead to something that simply went too far. I hurt her very deeply, and this is the hardest thing for me, because she is an incredible person, and I've ruined her.

To those of you who are considering leaving your relationships because of this, who clicked my post looking for advice, I cannot help you. Our relationships are different. But I can tell you that there is no shortage of passionate, single women out there. I went on a date this week, got drunk, got molested by her at the bar, went to her place, fooled around. No sex. She slept topless and kept taking my hands and putting them on her breasts throughout the night. After being rejected for so long, I could not believe that there were women out there that wanted me. And that is a great feeling. It was a fun experience at the time, but it left me feeling very empty because I had no connection with her other than physical, and it made me realize how special my relationship was.

I suggested we talk about what we want from each other, what turns us on, let's play around a little and he refused to talk about it. Then, after I confronted him again (especially about watching porn but not wanting sex with me) it was ""porn is easier"". Now, I feel like I've tried. I initiate almost every day, offer blowjobs without asking for reciprocation, hang out naked/ in revealing clothing, and I'm exhausted. I just feel like a nag, and I feel rejected, unattractive, and hurt. I wouldn't give a shit about porn if I felt like he wanted me. We had a minor argument last night, and went to bed. Got up to get water and he was watching porn. I feel horrible. He doesn't want to make out with me, or show interest in me physically. He doesn't try to attract or seduce me at all, and only initiates sex after I've been bothering him for a while. He'll occasionally ask for a BJ and I oblige. What the fuck am I doing wrong?

I was raised in a religious family, in which my dad took pride in being different than the heathens around us. It took until my mid teens before I liberated myself from this view of the world. By then, I had already started to feel like an outsider, however now trying to get back in. A couple of rough years being bullied around this time, further settled my self-image of not being welcome in the group.

I had a couple of good friends, who also were outside of the popular crew. Still, they had found or formed other places to hang out and seemed to live pretty regular teen lives, including parties and the occasional sexual tale to tell. Meanwhile, I joined in most things: drinking, late-night hanging out, etc. However, I lacked the confidence to hunt for romance. Here, I think, my (perceived) isolation became symbolized in the lack of sex, since this is where I still was different.

After moving out, I soon met my wife. She is a couple of years older and had been around more than me, with a couple of serious relationships behind her. I fell madly in love, but after just a little while, her will for sex dried up. There were medical reasons involved, but to this day I can't help but wonder if my eagerness to be ""normal"" through sex caused some of it. After a year or so, I learned to cope with the lack of sexual validation by shoving my feelings aside. I decided that I wanted to be with her, even if it meant to give up a working sex life. We distanced ourselves from each other sexually, and had a good life together despite -- or maybe thanks to -- this.

Ten years and two kids (very planned, including the activities required for conception) later, we've started to search our way back together sexually by way of couples' therapy. I'm happy and optimistic about this, and I think we'll sort it out. Unfortunately my old feelings of inadequacy and of being left outside has returned. For example, if there is a sex scene in a movie and I see my wife smiling, my mind says ""Oh, so sex makes you happy -- only not with me?"". When she jokes around with her friends on the topic, I feel similarly. Rejection if I make a move is probably the worst, so to protect myself I usually don't take any initiative.

I guess my feelings are close to jealousy, and it would probably look like it from the outside. However, my emotions are directed at my inadequacy and being left out, rather than at her. Rationally, I am all for fantasies and a liberated view on sex. Emotionally, I feel like a pathetic, immature wreck.

So, I'm looking for anything that can help me detach the idea of sex from my sense of worth.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_17b848,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/17b848/sex_is_a_measure_of_my_value_for_me_and_i/,

My ex-wife (34F) and I (37M) suffered from a DB for the last 3 years of our 7.5 year marriage.  After 2 kids and settling into the domestic life she seemed to lose all sexual interest (in me at least).  We tried counseling but in the end she seemed to just get more apathetic toward me and increasingly pissed off about my “preoccupation” with our nonexistent sex life.  The final straw was when she told me that if I was so unhappy, I should just leave.  Two weeks later I believe I gave her the shock of her life by taking her advice.  I’m convinced that she never believed that I would actually do it.

A little over 2 years later, after an ugly divorce and custody battle, I’m doing ok.  After some horrible dating experiences I’ve met a nice person (26F) that I’m seeing on a regular basis.  We met in an AA meeting (the divorce was my high bottom) so it’s a relationship built on a rocky foundation but she has been good for me and I like to think I’m good for her.  Things are going well at work (which is good because a lot of my money goes to her and the kids), I’ve been sober for a year and half, I get to see my kids almost every weekend and best of all I’m involved with a woman that wants to make love to me.  It’s not ideal but I believe I’m at a place in my life that I think I can learn to be happy again.

By default, I’ve kept up with my ex-wife’s life (I have to see her to pick up the kids) through her and the kids.  She is an extremely attractive woman and I had no doubt that she would not have any trouble finding a partner.  This bothered me when I was contemplating leaving her because I imagined me living alone in misery for the rest of my life while suffering though her being swamped with the attention of successful, attractive, potential partners.  It turns out she did meet an older, very wealthy, successful guy who, after announcing their engagement, she moved in with about nine months ago and proceeded to sell our very nice 4 bed, 3 bath house in the suburbs.  She and the kids live in his goddamn mansion while I’m stuck in a two bedroom apartment by myself.  It is pretty hard to take but I’m dealing with it.  She’s living the dream so fuck me, right?

Well things are not always as they seem.  My wife’s fiancé is a complete and utter control freak.  He will not allow me to pick up the kids from her unless he is present.  This has been a huge source of frustration for me since it makes picking them up a scheduling nightmare.  From what I learned through the kids and by my own observations I could tell that he was the very possessive, jealous, controlling type.  This, unfortunately, was not apparent to my wife until after she moved in with him.

So, last Friday I was supposed to go pick up the kids for the weekend after work.  My wife informed me that due to an unforeseen problem, her fiancé would not be flying back into town from his business trip until Saturday morning.  Of course this pissed me off because that would mean I would not be able to pick up the kids until Saturday because, of course, he had to be there.  She surprised me by inviting me to come on over and get them anyway.  This was very unusual because she has never been particularly accommodating when it comes to me picking up the kids but even more so because this defied one of his rules.  Of course I couldn't give a fuck about his rules and I wanted to see my kids so off I went.  

When I showed up to the mansion, the kids were not there…?  My wife explained that she had sent them over to a friend’s house to play because we needed to talk.  My god, the dam broke.  I have never seen her so upset in my life.  She let it all out.  Her dream had turned into a nightmare and she was in a living hell according to her.  She said that she would give anything to have her old life back with me and the kids all together.  She swears that her fiancé is not physically abusive but the mental and emotional abuse is simply unbearable.  She said she feels trapped because she doesn't think she can support herself and take care of the kids on her own even with the alimony money I'm paying her.  She said that she had taken me for granted and that she longs for the love, trust and respect we once shared as partners, parents and lovers.

This was the woman I loved… the woman I have always loved.  I was so confused.  I was filled with dread, optimism and heartbreak all at the same time.  We made mad passionate love in her fiancé's bed.  Am sure my judgment is skewed, but in my biased opinion it is the most passionate sex we have ever had.  I love this woman.  She was so afraid of him finding out, she had me wait in my car when she went and got the kids so it would appear that I had just arrived to pick them up.  She acts like she is scared shitless of this guy and it breaks my heart. 

So DB, have any of you ever tried to reconnected with the ex-SO of a DB?  Do any of you keep in contact with the ex-SO?  Would you consider rekindling a relationship?  And more specifically what do you think I should do?  I have been brooding over this all week.  She texted me yesterday and said that she wants to see me this weekend if we can work it out.  I’m in complete turmoil here DB, what should I do?  I cannot express how badly I want the preDB-her back but it would destroy me to return to the DB-her.  I’m scared of even looking down this road, let alone actually starting down it, but I can’t seem to turn myself around. 

edit - WTF, I just noticed I dropped the ex in ex-wife halfway through this post... I'm not even going to bother editing it.  Help!

edit2 - Well I took to heart what several of you said about the current woman I'm seeing.  I agree what I did was completely unfair to her and I believe she had a right to know.  I invited her over this evening and confessed to sleeping with my ex.  She was understandably angry at first but then just became very sad.  She said she understood and that she truly hoped I would find happiness someday.  She said she loved me and had been envisioning us in a long-term relationship lately and really thought it could have worked.  Then she leaned over and gave me a long, hard hug, looked me in the eye and told me to never contact her again.  She stood up and walked out the door.

I am a female who was once engaged to a man. I tried having sex with him ~once a month to be ""a good girlfriend,"" but because sex always ended up being so painful, we only ended up having ""successful"" sex a few times a year. I thought that I just had a very low sex drive, or that I had vaginismus. There was a problem, but surely it was clinical. 

I had always thought women were pretty, but because I'm very feminine and I don't fit into ""lesbian culture,"" I never once thought I was gay. When I moved to a new place for graduate school, I realized that my sex drive was actually quite high, but that my fantasies were always very ""generic"" in nature - not about anyone in particular. Eventually, I asked my fiance if I could try kissing a girl while we were long distance. He agreed.

Being with women made my heart fly with sparks that I have never felt before, never conceived as even being _possible._ I broke up with my fiance, and my girlfriend and I are having sex 10-12 times a week.

 Earlier this week I read this article about the Coolidge Effect that was posted elsewhere on Reddit, something about male mice getting tired of one partner, but as soon as a new one showed up he wasn't tired anymore.  It basically explained that men more or less need new stimuli to stay satisfied sexually over a long period of time and how porn somewhat exacerbates the problem.  If you haven't read that article, it's [worth a read](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cupids-poisoned-arrow/201108/porn-novelty-and-the-coolidge-effect).   

I shared it with my boyfriend and he was very interested, nodding his head and agreeing with lots of it.  I told him, *one more time*, how it effects me when we don't have sex as much as before and how unwanted I feel.  After reading that it was like something switched on in his head and he was actually hearing what I was saying.

On Friday he took me on a romantic date, no sex that night because I came down with a bad cold and the symptoms crashed our date kind of suddenly.  It was still an intimate time we spent talking and laughing again, so I was happy.  I fell asleep in his arms and all was well.

Last night I let him do his thing all night.  I usually feel pissed and lonely when he plays video games on weekend nights, when his time is so limited and we could be going out, but I decided last night I'd read a book while he played and just assumed I was going to fall asleep by myself yet again so I didn't even try to get him to come to bed.  

Out of nowhere, 10 pm rolled around and he actually came to bed without me asking.  We talked for a little bit, then he surprised me yet again by going down on me.  THIS IS SOMETHING HE NEVER DOES.  At least without serious hesitations, he hates giving oral sex.  (I should mention last month as a hint I sent him a link to this [NSFW oral lesson](http://www.youporn.com/watch/200577/pussy-eating-lesson) and he laughed it off.)  CLEARLY he watched the video, he blew my mind!  I really have never in our 2 years together enjoyed when he gave me oral because I knew he wasn't enjoying himself... but last night he was happy to do it, he seemed more confident than ever and I had to repeat ""surrender"" to myself in my head to enjoy it.  We finished with some intimate, face to face sex and afterward I couldn't help but ask if there was a catch.

I asked if he wanted something from me, or if he had something to tell me-- I couldn't help being a little suspicious of his motives for random oral out of the blue since it is truly that rare and precious up in here.  He laughed and told me there was no catch, he loved me and promised to try harder. 

SO!  Long story short, Idunno which of the links I shared really made him think, or if just by sharing them I somehow changed the dynamic from me whining about no sex to him actually doing something about it... idunno what happened honestly.  But I'll take it.  And hopefully this will be the last you guys will hear from me. Thanks!

If she needed to call me for any reason, the call will end with a simple good bye and times not even that. To say that my bedroom is dead would be I feel a misnomer; it is in fact my marriage that is dead. What life remains, rests inside our two children. I fear the impact a divorce will have on them. Will they to grow up to feel that a normal marriage is one were love and affection is absent?

I am a very introspective person. I look to actions not words for the meaning of things. My marriage was not always like this game of avoidance I have now and I know that we both have had our parts to play in this tragedy.

I have been married over fifteen years and I am 35, she is 36. Of the lessons I have taken in, the most important of those is to never marry prior to your mid 20’s. Not that this will do me any good now, but maybe someone will take that to heart. My reasons for this are simple. In you mid 20’s you are just now experiencing life for the first time really. You are free from the watchful eyes of your parents. Freedom at this age is unlike anything at any other time. I think you spend the rest of your life longing for and in search of this freedom. To get married now to deny this from yourself and from that you will plant the seeds of regret and regret as the saying goes is a bitch.
I have always been shy around women, doubly so when in the presence of someone I find attractive and desirable. Due to this I spent all of high school never finding a girlfriend. It wasn’t till a year after graduation, while at a party, that while inebriated that I finally found the courage to speak to whom would become my wife. She too was shy, but the alcohol was having a similar effect for her apparently. We talked and seemingly clicked. We lost our virginity to one another within a week. 

She was in college and only in town for the week, so our relationship became one of long distance. I shortly left to join the military. Over the course of the next year, we kept the relationship going. Seeing each other on major holidays till the second year when I was stationed within a few hours of her school. I was then able to go see her once a month and sometimes twice. To say the sex was unbelievable would not do it justice. I long so badly for a glimmer of this. Older and wiser I know it was the absence of the contact that made the sex what it was. Fast forward a couple years to the end of my military career and she is finishing college, I proposed. The first time we spent any significant time together was after we were married. 

I mention our early relationship to paint the picture. I can identify my failings and I can draw inferences for hers.

Our failings in this, was that we never learned how to date. My idea then and even now, to a degree, is that dating is going out to eat and I think hers is much the same. Only recently, past year or so, have I actually started to learn that dating is so much more than that. It is spending time with someone else and they being your center of attention during that time and you being theirs.  It is exploring each other’s personality and every other aspect of them. I feel now that I went from step 1 to step 10 and skipped everything in between. The most important things that I can think of that we skipped were building up mutual trust and the ability to be open and honest with each other. I think nearly all of our issues now can be traced back to having never laid the foundations for this. We as a couple never went through these critical steps.

Another failing of mine, at least when compared with my wife, is the relationship my father has with my mother. I think there is truth in that we learn about relationship dynamics from our own observations. Which relationship have we observed the longest? My guess is our own parent’s relationship. My parents were affectionate and loving. My father told me that he always says he loves my mother anytime he leaves the house or hangs up the phone. His reasoning was that if something was to happen to him, the last thing my mother would have heard from him was I love you. I think that exemplifies how two people in love should behave. They were open about sex and discussed it freely; it wasn’t something to be ashamed about. Now, no one was running around naked mind you because they also taught modesty, but they taught my siblings and me to communicate. My father encouraged us to challenge beliefs, why did we think the way we did, to change our thoughts on something as we learned more about it. I credit my father alone for the way I critically evaluate everything.

My wife’s family, again with observations, could not be any more different than mine, polar opposite really. If my family was the positive end of a magnet hers would be the negative. In the fifteen plus years I have been around them, I think I have seen her parents hold hands less than ten times, much less kiss. I cannot recall a time that I have ever heard either one utter, “I love you”. My take away from this, is that her family repressed everything that my family lifted up and embraced. I like her family. They are nice people, just not affectionate or loving. Discussions center around small talk, politics, weather, what to plant this season,… Funny that those very topics are now all that my wife and I discuss.

So not only did my wife and I never learn to communicate, our perceptions of what it is to communicate are drastically different. Join that with a differing view on affection and you have a toxic recipe. 
I find other aspects of my wife’s personality need mentioning. She is smart, unbelievably so. This attribute is what I found so interesting when I first met her. Yet with all this intelligence, she has zero ambition. Her dream job is to not work or if she has to, someplace that doesn’t require her to think or interact with others. Actually, she has stated she wants to be a librarian, not sure how she reconciles that in her head with the people interaction though. Her current job involves a lot of daily interaction with others. She hates office politics and brings home this anger she feels of someone getting something they didn’t earn or deserve. I’ve long since stopped asking about work. I’d sooner ask her to join a satanic cult. I’ve encouraged her to pursue her master’s degree in library science. This is required for librarian jobs. She can’t, to busy, we don’t have the money, and now doesn’t want to.

I think I have summed up our personalities, but life is a series of events. Marriage is no different. Our first year was the typical newlywed. We rented a house from a friend of hers that was moving away. This house was filthy. The word squalor comes to mind. We put in over a thousand dollars in cleaning supplies and replacement odds and ends just to get it livable. While there the wife found me surfing some porn. Our first real fight happened. I chuckle now about this and attribute it to youth. The endless search for the ever elusive breast, but I digress. I am a male, if I get horny I will look to find some tits and ass. If not in the flesh, I will find it virtually to rub one out. I still look I admit, but not like then. I can now go weeks without it/ not thinking of it. I have found it easier to ignore it than be reminded of what I am missing. What I should have seen then was how she handled it. She stopped talking to me for days. This is a pattern that she has continued to this day.

Her friend moves back months later and wants the house back, why not it has been cleaned and the next two years was spent living with my parents for a year and then hers for a year. Sex now is becoming a once a week thing. It is slowing down, but I see that now through the goggles of hindsight. We are each focusing on our respective careers and toward the end of this period the wife goes back to school for another degree. She graduates and we move to our own apartment where we spend the next year. For the next year or so, it felt like another honeymoon. In fact it probably was since we had been with our parents like we were. Sex was more spontaneous, we were affectionate. It was bliss. As we are approaching the five year mark, we start to talk children and our salaries have improved. With my veteran status, we found and purchased a home. At the one year mark in the home, we brought home our first child. It was around her birth that the change really started or was apparent. I wondered then and still wonder now if my wife suffered/suffers from postpartum depression. I have asked for her to talk to someone, but have always gotten resistance to it. 

I do not really recall her snapping at me prior. Sure we had fights, but this was different. Her words seemed to have developed more of an edge to them as they cut deeper. It was in the 7-8 year mark that I think my conscious mind started to drag up the thoughts of divorce. We talked and seemingly worked it out and baby number two came along by the ten year mark. Sex is now bi weekly mostly. That’s all I ever think about, she has a headache, just not tonight, etc. All the usual excuses. What we did have in the beginning seemed like Cirque du Soleil compared to what we do now. 

Since child #1 had been born I have been going to school at night. 2-3 nights out of the week from when the eldest was 6 months old and until year 13 of our marriage nearly early every semester I worked on my bachelor’s degree. My sleep patterns changed; even now three years since I graduated I have problems falling asleep prior to 10 at night. I started school in part because of my daughter. It was standing there in the delivery room that I realized I had to do more than what I was doing now to provide a good life for her. Looking back now, I need to capture that thought again and embrace it. I need to show her more than what hard work can accomplish. I need to show her what you do when a relationship isn’t working.

The past three years since I have graduated have been the absolute worse in the marriage.  We have a crying what’s wrong with our marriage talk with increasing frequency. Last one was this past February. Sex life is nonexistent. Once or twice every three to four months. 

I used to randomly send flowers to her at work, would pay extra if needed to ensure early morning delivery. Two years ago when she was having an especially bad time at work I sent her some hoping to cheer her up.  She didn’t even acknowledge I sent them for three weeks. I had to ask her if she ever got them. Her response was telling me, “What’s the point, not like they could change anything.” I stopped sending them after that.   I used to be the guy that warmed towels in the dryer while she was in the shower. According to her I was just trying to see her naked. Write “I Love you” on the mirror with the oil from your finger (Only shows when the room gets steamy.) and I was smudging it up. My degree I worked so hard on so I could be an example for my daughter, she pissed on. Not literally mind you, but figuratively. She complained when I said I wanted her there. I graduated as my daughter went to spend the night with a friend. I used to by her sexy underwear and sexy outfits to wear, Victoria Secret stuff. She doesn’t wear any of it. I have bought her plain Hanes packs and she complained about the patterns or lack thereof. The past three or four Christmases I have bought her Disney themed pajama sets. I went for as unsexy as I could get.. She wears those. Long gone are the passing touches, I can’t recall the last passionate kiss I have gotten, a simple non-prompted “I love you” is too difficult for her to say.  We have gone on two cruises, we live in a home port, and spent the majority of the time in the cabin. Which would be nice if the obvious was happening, but she read a book and I spent the time trying to find something to watch. Sex again was not on the table( nor anywhere else in the room).

During previous talks she complained I do nothing to help her around the house. I was helping, she just wasn’t seeing it. After that talk though I stepped it up, surely she just wasn’t noticing it right? She is doing her catnapping when I come in most days. If she hears me open anything but the fridge, she will come stomping in with her jaw fixed just so. If I ask what is for dinner and can I help, I am told she’s got it. I do cook on the weekends though, according to her that’s my time. She’s complained that I never tell her what I want to eat. Hell I am a guy, as long as it is not moving and still warm it’s a meal. I found a site called eMeals.com. Wonderful site. They send you a list of seven dinners and a shopping list. Showed the wife and she turned her nose up, expensive ingredients, hate that type of food, take too long to cook. Another complaint was that she gets up at 6am on Sunday to go grocery shopping. I have offered to do the shopping myself and was similarly rebuffed. What I have learned is that she wants to complain and have no resolution.

I sit here typing, rather than doing. I have a litany of excuses to do nothing but those are going away and falling apart around me much like my marriage has. I have done nothing but bury my head in college and then video games for far too many years. I have hidden myself away from living and I am finding it harder and harder to hide. Much like in Shawshank redemption, I need to get busy living. I recently opened a second bank account using my parents address. I am slowly putting money aside to pay for the attorney. I have started using gift cards I have been given to purchase items for an apartment. Paltry as those actions seem, they have given me a breath of fresh air that I have needed.

I can see the next talk will be in the next few months ahead I will say I want a divorce then and I will be prepared. I fix things for a living. I am told I am rather good at what I do. I have tried fixing our relationship and have failed. My conclusion is that it is not broken from her stand point and my efforts are not needed.

1362667390.0,29,self.DeadBedrooms,19uh22,Given up initiating sex,34,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19uh22/given_up_initiating_sex/,"Where to start.

We've (I'm 30, she's 38) been together for 6 years, living together for 3 years, married for two. One child, 3 years old.

I consider myself to have quite a high libido, and I consider sex to be a very important factor in any healthy relationship.
**For me it makes me feel close to my wife, loved, needed &amp; desired**

When we were dating, before we moved in together we'd have sex every time we were together. 

We moved in together, had a child, and it seems to have gone downhill since then, but I want to note that I'm pretty sure the lack of sex is not related to having a child. He's great he goes to sleep at 19:30, and he's asleep until the next morning. 

It's not like either of us are constantly up taking care of him, or losing any sleep because of him. There is plenty of time for sex. As a parent I'm also not suggesting sex at unrealistic times. When my son is awake and playing, hes with us and we're doing fun stuff together as a family. 

I'm always(99% of the time - in 6 years, she has initiated it twice) the one to initiate sex.

Nearly every time I try to initiate it, I'm shot down. I reached the point about 6 months ago where I decided that I'd had enough, and I was just not going to bother initiating anymore and wait to see if she does. 

I felt frustrated and hurt.

She didn't even appear to notice. I actually asked her ""have you noticed I'm not trying to have sex with you?""

We sat down and talked about it, a lot about how me suggesting or talking about us having sex later that night, or in the morning, was putting pressure on her which in turn was turning her off, making her not want to have sex. 
To me, the anticipation of sex is almost as much of a turn on as the actual act.  

Never the less, it felt like I was the cause / problem.

She basically said that she doesn't go around ""just feeling horny"", I need to get her into the mood, I can't just ""ask her if she wants to have sex"" and, her words ""I **could** be receptive to it any night, but you will never know unless you try"". 

Suggestions have been along the lines of: more cuddling on the couch, foot rubs, back rubs, kissing, etc. to get her into the mood. 
(I was, and still do give great foot rubs, back rubs and do all of the suggested things, the suggestion was for **MORE** of them.)

I thought after that conversation that we had come to an understanding(both of us agreed) that we needed to be more intimate than just once every couple of months.

Things haven't really changed. I don't talk about us having sex, I don't want to add any extra pressure. 
I try to emphasize cuddling and massages a lot more often(when ever we get the chance), doing the things she has said will get her in the mood, but they don't seem to work - she does enjoy them though.

We've had sex about once a month since then, and I'm frustrated as hell really. I think she sees once a month as ""enough"". 

An example, last night I spent an hour massaging her feet (which I know she LOVES), I like to think it was clear that I was hoping to get her in the mood, but she basically just curled up in bed afterwards and fell asleep, I felt cold and abandoned.

I feel like giving up, my brain keeps telling me that we are sexually incompatible. I love her, I want it to work, and I REALLY want our sex life to improve.
I often sit down and think about how people jokingly say ""you have sex less when you're married"". 
I always thought it was a joke, but I'm starting to believe it.

I'd welcome any advice, maybe I am at fault. Either way I know I'm not happy with the situation.

Thanks for listening.

She took a few days off of work (which is a major drain on her energy) and has been a lot more of her old self lately.

It's my fault that we don't have very much sex, because any time he asks for it, it seems that I have an excuse (I'm tired, I feel fat, I have a headache, etc.). It's not that I'm not sexually attracted to him; I am. I just don't know what is wrong with me.
This has led him to believe that he is unnatractive and un-sexy and I feel so horrible because that is simply not the case. Furthermore, our lack of sex caused him to be quite hurtful towards me and we are separated now. Is there anything I can say or do to convice him I am attracted to him, physically?

Sexless Marriage, defined.",33,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/15yh6y/a_simple_clinical_observation_that_may_have_an/,"It's cliche for a married person to have complaints about how often they get sex.  The LL spouse can use the commonality of this complaint to rationalize that ""It's not as bad as you make it out to be - everyone else complains about it too."".  This is an unfair and hurtful judgement - but probably a fairly common one.  It also doesn't even take the actual frequency of sex into consideration.

Here's my notion: Having learned that the [_clinical definition_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexless_marriage) of a sexless marriage is couples who have it 10 times or less in a year - I think that a savy HL spouse can slip that factoid into an even-tempered conversation (not in the bedroom or after rejection/disappointment!), and continue to use that description when discussing the subject.

It could be an eye opener.  Like an addict learning that they really truly _are_ addicted, in clinical terms - they can't just rationalize it away as ""well, I'm not doing great - but it isn't a _problem_ for me"".  If used in an un-charged and level-headed way - the term sexless marriage could even be included in discussion in groups containing friends and family (possibly should only be considered by those who are all-but sure it won't do more harm than good).

You can say ""our sexless marriage"" with as much neutrality as you could say ""my diabetes"" or ""your heart condition"".  The plain, frank, fact of the matter may have an impact in your favor.  You are trying to solve a problem, hopefully with the compassion and understanding befitting of a worthy lover, using the term makes it clear that if they aren't also working toward a solution - they can't deny being more responsible for the problem.",,False,,t5_2t25p,1357318868.0,,,True,t3_15yh6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/15yh6y/a_simple_clinical_observation_that_may_have_an/,

Like plenty of other men, my wife let herself go, and I am no longer interested in sex with her.  I have tried everything and I am just not into it, even after drinking I have no desire to be with her sexually.  The rest of our relationship is actually pretty good, we still spend time together, our family life is doing pretty well.  It feels a bit like we have moved into a functional but slightly awkward friend relationship.  Sex for me has just become very awkward.  

I would say on average we have sex maybe 2-3 times a month.  Recently though, I think it has been about a month since we have had sex.  She knows that I am HL, and she is as well for the most part.

Last night my wife and I were talking, and out of nowhere she says to me ""so who are you fucking?"".  I said no one, and that is the truth.  I have not cheated on my wife, and have no plans to.  Of course I have fantasies like everyone else, but realize it is a bad idea.  Unfortunately she does not believe me, and finds it impossible that I am going all this time without sex.  I think she suspects that when I am ""away for work"" I am actually having an affair of some sort, but I am not, I am actually working.  Short of handing her my phone and laptop and having her go through them, which she does not want to do, what should I do?  Also, does this indicate that she is probably having an affair herself, or is planning to and that is why she is suddenly attacking me?  Also, in one of our last times having sex, I mixed things up a bit trying to create a spark, and while we enjoyed it a bit, she was very quiet and it was awkward after.  I know her well enough to know what she was thinking.  She was thinking to herself that this ""new move"" must be from someone I am having an affair with, and may have been where her thoughts developed.

We think either that they’re trying to manipulate us, or we come up with other things they’re doing wrong. Or, perhaps even more likely, we think to ourselves: “I’m glad he cares about me, because I work really hard. I need to take a break now so he can carry more of the load”, and we don’t think of returning the favour much at all.

http://tolovehonorandvacuum.com/2011/01/wifey-wednesday-post-you-wont-want-to/

This site talks about it as if it were a gender thing, but I think it's true in general. If you put a lot of effort into pleasing your partner without getting effort returned, you're sending the message that:

* Things are good in your relationship (otherwise, why would you make all that effort?)

* You're the kind of person who pleases others, not the kind of person who receives pleasure or the kind who sees relationships as a mutual, balanced thing.

* You don't believe in having a fair or balanced relationship, and have no problem being taken advantage of.

* Your partner works really hard (since you're making an effort to do more) and so he/she should stop trying and working so hard.

So, if you're in a situation where you're doing a bunch of things for your partner, chores, housework, kind gestures, whatever... **STOP!** You need to shake things up a little and show that you're not ok with being in an imbalanced relationship, and that you're not afraid of taking charge and demanding what you want.

I think about us and our eight year relationship and how much he means to me.... Then I spend three hours on motherless running through batteries like crazy and crying uncontrollably after finally orgasming.

He says its because of his blood pressure medication. And fine, I get that. But he's under 45, in great shape, and has been thoroughly looked over by a cardiologist who says he's perfectly healthy and simply needs to find a way to relieve all his stress. The doctor suggested starting with therapy. This was completely unacceptable to my boyfriend, so the doctor prescribed him something.

He doesn't like to talk about it. Whenever I bring it up he just...shuts me down. So I don't get the chance to tell him I need something to change because I'm thinking hard about cheating. Or that masturbating makes me cry.

What he does know is that I spend hours every day talking to guys online that I've met on a bdsm site. And he doesn't care, he just tells me not to talk to anyone in our state and not to meet anyone. Shouldn't he care? It would drive me crazy if I knew he was having sexually explicit conversations with other girls online.

I can't even get him to use a toy on me. And I don't want to leave him. And I don't want to be in a long term relationship where I'm not getting laid. I don't want to feel like my boyfriend is just my best friend. I don't know how to fix this. Working on myself doesn't even do anything. I tried dressing a little nicer and wearing a bit of make up when we're together and he just told me that I could stop doing that because he doesn't care what I look like.

I'm sorry if this is confusing and not well organized. I'm just so frustrated and I need to get it out and theres no one I can talk to about it because they're all his friends too and I don't want to embarrass him. So...what would the women of reddit do?

I'm 32m, she's 36f, been together 6 years. Our relationship was amazing for the first 4 years - not only fantastic sex, 2-3 times a week even after 4 years, but also we could be really open and honest with our feelings. I never felt bad about saying if I was horny, or discussing my fantasies even if I knew it wasn't her thing. Best of all she completely understood how men think about sex. 

We decided to have a kid. During the pregnancy we would still have sex when logistics would allow. However after our child was born she completely lost interest. Initially I was expecting this, I waited 3 months, then 6 months, then a year. After a year we had The Talk. She said it was 'normal' to lose your sex drive after becoming a mum, and she hates her body now, yes it's slightly different after the kid, but not that much in my opinion - which doesn't count of course, and she's very uncomfortable being naked. She felt that sex was something she used to do when she was younger but she's too old now. She's a little disgusted with her 'former' self, and no longer understands how men think. Worst of all we lost the openness as any talk of sex makes her feel prudish.

We tried all the usual things: I tried giving the child to the grandparents so we could escape to a romantic hotel for the weekend, didn't work. We did one session of counselling but she hated it. I tried setting up a sex night - this was the worst, having sex with someone who isn't enjoying it is the most repugnant thing ever. We talked about it sometimes, basically she only wants sex to have another child and I'm adamant that we're not having another child until our sex life is functional. Finally I asked if she felt under pressure from me and would she rather I backed off a bit? She said she would like that.

So I backed off completely, I figured that perhaps if I withheld intimacy she would eventually crave it and come back to me. That never happened. Instead I got increasingly more frustrated. After 3 months of nothing (following on from 2 years of not much) I snapped. In the end I met up with a friend of a friend and..., well see my username. The best thing about it was that she's both older and a (single) mum which debunks two of the excuses my partner is clinging to.

The downside of course is that our relationship is in tatters and I'm not sure what to do about it. The problem is ultimately I can't make her fancy me and I don't want to be celibate. Philandering is all very well but I only get sex once a week or so, and I hate the guilt and the clandestine nature of everything. In the back of my mind I'm a little worried that mediocre sex with my parner will be a poor alternative to good sex with a lover but I guess that's my karma coming home to roost. 

I've been lurking here long enough to know what the standard advice is. I'm not going to claim any moral highground for my actions - I'm not proud and no doubt deserve anything I get. I'll probably have one more go at councelling before moving on completely.

When we do have sex she is always really into it and the sex is absolutely great.  Unfortunately, this makes a grand total of 4 times this year.  Afterward, she was saying ""I always forget how easy it is to have sex with you, I don't know why I build it up as this big thing in my mind"" and then she went on to talk about seeing her doc or her shrink about her low libido.

We had the talk about a month ago and since then she has mentioned trying to do something about her libido a few times.  I'll believe it when I see it, in the meantime, I'm going to hunker back down for another 3 months, or maybe 2 if I'm particularly lucky.

1343044708.0,31,self.DeadBedrooms,x0fyg,LLP here. I'm trying.,38,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/x0fyg/llp_here_im_trying/,"I am just going to lay it all out there, and I hope very much not to be crucified - I know this subreddit is more for HL partners. I really hope that I don't say anything that is insensitive to you, but feel free to let me know if I do, because I'd kinda like this to be a constructive discussion. And I really am trying to save my marriage!

**A bit of background:** I am a married woman in my mid thirties. My husband and I met at high school and married straight after we finished. We have been married for 16 years. We've had more than our share of problems, which I have been studiously ignoring for years. Around October last year, things came to a head, and we've been trying to solve the problems since. We're in counselling, which is sometimes great, mostly awful. The marriage counselling has not focused much on our sexual issues.

I could easily go for six months without sex. My husband not so much. Until recently, we've comprimised at about 3 times a month.  I find that the more sex I'm having, the more I think about sex and am happy to have it. I have always enjoyed sex with my husband, once we've started. He is very attractive, sexy and he really knows how to satisfy me in bed. I orgasm easily, and usually multiple times. But I have never prioritised it.

Over the past year and a half, my husband has given me ""the Talk"" a few times. Sometimes sitting down in person, sometimes by email. The problems he raised were:

* **Frequency** - he wanted us to have sex more often.
* **Blowjobs** - he told me that the way I am about his cum makes him feel like I think he is disgusting; that he loves getting bjs and it makes him feel unattractive that I don't do it.
* **Porn** - he wanted to watch porn together. He went on and on about it, and I am really not sure I understand his thing about it enough to describe it.
* **Initiating** - he told me that he didn't want to be the one who always initiated. It made him feel like I didn't enjoy sex with him if I never initiated.
* **Places** - I only ever want to have sex in bed. He wanted more adventure and spontaneity. He wanted to have sex in other places in our apartment, or perhaps elsewhere.

Initially, when we had the talk, I just agreed to everything and tried to forget about it. In my mind, I was like ""we have all of these problems in our life, and you only want to solve this one? there's nothing wrong with our sex."" I felt like the talk was something bad he was doing to me. I was offended also, because there was a big mismatch between the way I think of myself, sexually speaking, and the way he saw me. I thought that he was making me out to be a prude with lots of hangups, and I didn't think I was.

It took a few of these talks and emails for me to really understand what he was saying, and it took ages to process the information enough to feel like it was something I should do something about. I've been (very slowly) trying to improve.

The thing that was easiest one was initiating. This was something that I could easily admit (in my own mind) was true, and unfair, and caused him pain. I wasn't initiating enough, and I understood his hurt when he described it. It made sense, and there was an easy solution: I needed to initiate more. So I started initiating more. I could still improve in this regard (he still initiates around 60% of the time, but that is down from 100%).

The next problem I tackled was blowjobs. I used to give them sometimes when we first starting seeing each other, and pretended to enjoy them. I felt incredibly inadequate giving them and felt like a spaz - like I was doing it wrong. I have a sensitive gag reflex and I had always tried to hide that I was almost about to vomit the entire time. I didn't much like the taste and texture of his cum and tried to hide this from him. Anyway, after a while I just stopped doing it, and he stopped asking for it. I thought it was just something we didn't do because it wasn't that fun (I thought it was like how we tried anal some time in the first year, and we didn't do it again because it wasn't very fun - we probably did it wrong). So, once the problem was raised, I spent a bit of time reading stuff on r/sex, and found that there were women there who got really excited about giving bjs, and were proud of the pleasure they were able to give partners. I envied that and decided to try to find the joy of giving blowjobs. It's about 6 months later, and I love sucking his cock. (Yay! It makes me feel great about myself that I can say that now.) My partner gives me lots of compliments on my technique. :)

The porn thing has not gone so well. I don't enjoy watching porn with my husband. I feel weird because I do check out porn by myself sometimes, but I do it differently. I feel guilty, because he spent AGES trawling through the interwebs finding things he thought I might like. He put a great deal of effort into it, but I just didn't like it. The women are very different from me, and they make me feel inadequate. Anyway, we have tried it a few times, and he is pretty unhappy with my reactions. I have tried to explain, but I myself don't really know why I don't like it, so it's hard to explain. I have given him mixed messages, and he's annoyed about it.

I also haven't made much progress with the places issue. A couple of times we've had sex in the lounge room, which he likes. I don't understand why he would like that, because it is so much more comfortable in the bed, and way easier to clean up the mess afterwards!

The frequency is something I only made a half hearted attempt at, to be honest. I didn't think it was that important, so I didn't put effort into improving this. The thing is, that women get lots of messages from society like ""if there is something sexual that you don't want to do, then you don't have to. no one can force you to do anything."" So I never felt any pressure to do anything I didn't feel like. If I wasn't in the mood, then we didn't have sex. I discovered this subreddit about a week ago, and read enough to realise that my attitude was a huge mistake. No, he can't have sex with me against my will - but it should totally be my will to have sex with him! He's my husband! So we have been having more sex in the last week. The awesome (and totally unexpected) side affect of this is that he seems more willing to do things that will improve the problems I have with our relationship!

I guess one of the things about my story, that might help you, is that just because no progress is made after ""the talk"", it could just take time. It took me quite a while to understand things from our talks enough to do anything to solve the problems. It took me quite a while to not think about what had been raised in them without anger. When I think about some of the changes in my attitude over the past year, I really wonder at how dim I was, not to understand some really basic stuff about sex in relationships.

then the inevitable happened. she contracted hpv anyway. i guess the vaccine only protects against certain strains and it is more effective the longer it's been in the system. she'd only gotten it recently before we started having sex. I was supportive and often went with her to the doctors while she got help. but, needless to say, this negatively altered our relationship.

sex was gone. she was incapable of becoming aroused around me. she never got wet and even with lube sex was painful for her. i tried everything. literally every trick in the book. she would come home and i'd have flowers on the table, dinner cooked, the apartment cleaned, the dishes done, give her a massage, and at the end of the night she still wasnt in the mood. I suggested relationship counseling but she declined. 

three nights ago we admitted the reality of the situation to one another. we are just friends who live together and kiss on the lips. as soon as our lease is up, we're done. unfortunately thats in 3 months from now, but whatever.

things haven't changed much since then. the things that have bubbled beneath the surface are out in the open. we both cried hard that night. she held me while i literally sobbed like a 2nd grader. 

obviously things are odd and i'm sure there are more tears in the future, but i feel like new and better things are in store for both of us. we all deserve to be with someone who wants to have sex with us. even if you have love and companionship, without sex (for me anyway), a relationship is dangerously incomplete.

It seems as if fate is keeping us from having sex.  Although there is one update I think I need to share it might to help others.

First of all, I took everyone else's advice saying that abuse might be causing some of these problems.    So, I talked to my wife about it, and she's going to counseling now.   

But the biggest surprise.   She went to the doctor to see if anything was wrong with her and she got diagnosed with LYME DISEASE.    She's probably had it for at least 2 years.   One of the symptoms is potential loss of libido, it seems to be pretty common.

I'm being supportive of her, but as a warning to others, there may be a medical reason that is adding to the problem.  In our case, I don't think we'd be doing well without this, but with this problem, it absolutely makes it worse.    Just thought i'd warn others there are always unexpected reasons your partner may be uninterested in sex.

Sex has been up and down and my gf keeps saying it is because she is changing pills again.   I have been drinking more and more on the weekends and well the other night I just flipped.

Now my gf always like to tell me how much she does around the house and how she is always picking up after me.  I honestly don't believe this to be true because I am the one who does the majority of chores around the house. Vacuuming, mopping, bathrooms, dishes are things I do 95% of the time.  I am more likely to leave stuff out though but I wouldn't say this is a big deal and I don't really see her pick anything up since I usually pick that stuff up when I do my weekly big clean. 

 She told me the reason I wound up doing everything was because I always did it before she woke up (which is true but she sleeps all bloody day on the weekends) So I did nothing for a month. She did no chores in that month. (I did remind her several times during this month) However she always said after a tough week at work the last thing she feels like doing is chores.

Oh I also cook 95% of the time.  I think she has cooked for me twice in the last 6 months and if say one night I am not cooking she just doesn't eat or gets takeout.  

So the incident happened last Saturday.  I snapped and did all the chores which were neglected for a month so I spent awhile doing them. I also decided to sort some rooms out so basically I spent all day doing chores.  While I was not doing that I also put on a nice roast and figured hey this might as well have a nice meal and put us both in a good mood.

So by this stage I have had a few drinks and a little bit drunk when she emerged from bed just when dinner was ready. The first thing she said to me was to have a go at the fact my dirty clothes are on the floor in the corner of the bedroom which I quickly pointed out that there were no clothes baskets since she had all 5 of them with her clean clothes in them waiting to be put away.She then said I left a spoon in the sink.  I was pissed I spent the entire day cleaning the house and made it fairly spotless, cooked dinner and then she bitched about a spoon in the sink I left there during dinner preparations and somehow forgot that the sink was piled high with dishes just the day before.

I let it go, figured alright I will just put it in the dishwasher and keep my mouth shut. Then she made a comment about how she was always picking up after me.  This really pissed me off and I fired back ""When have you?  What was the last thing you picked up after me""  She said it was too numerous to call.  So I kept pressing her ""Give me an example""  and I kept pressing.  I was like a pitbull and wouldn't let go of it until she laughed it off and said ""I guess you have been good lately""

Then came the straw which broke the camels back, I have no idea what she was thinking. It was obvious I was fuming, it was obvious I was a bit drunk and she fired off ""Well no wonder I am never in the mood if you are like this""

I just saw red.  I threw my glass at the wall and shouted ""Like it fucking matters"" Told her to get the fuck out of my life, all she ever does it cause me stress.   She said how she wasn't leaving her house to which point I told her Remember that contract you signed. All I have to do is buy out your share which I could do easily.  

She then had this look of dread come over her face.  It was as if she suddenly realized why I went to all that effort and paying for lawyers and getting things signed.  It was to cover my ass for this very instance. She had signed away any rights to my property or assets. I told her this at the time I wouldn't buy anything with her unless I had this clause and I guess she must have figured that it wouldn't eventuate.

  I just kept telling her to get the fuck out.   I went to bed and she followed me. I kept telling her to fuck off but she wouldn't.  She snuggled up to me and I told her to go away.  We wound up having some of the most passionate sex we have had for a very long time. I am giving her some more time.   So far she has been more attentive towards the housework and is pitching in. I have agreed to cut back on the drinking. She did clean up the mess the glass made which I suppose is a plus.

However it is still early days, I wouldn't be surprised if she decided to sleep all this weekend either. In which case I guess our relationship will be a dead man walking.

If I can get myself turned on, we have sex and she enjoys it at that point, however many times if I don't get turned on within 2 mins of her effort, she starts sighing and stroking in an annoyed fashion and at this point I can't get turned on because of her demeanor and effort, and eventually stop. She also starts acting this way if I request anything different or want to move to a different position that will work better, so I never do that anymore because it will just be this immediate wall of attitude and end up a failure. I have tried to talk to her about this (right after and at neutral times) and she basically won't talk about it or listen to me, she takes it as a personal attack or just won't talk about sex like a mature person, she reminds me of a 15.y.o because she won't take any sex discussion seriously. For me, I know if she would just take a second to seriously listen to a couple things that turn me on and make an effort to do them, this wouldn't be a problem, but if I say anything like that she just says I am the problem and that its up to me to get turned on. She is like a brick wall. The only time this changes is when she is drunk, she gets into it and all of a sudden she does all the things she knows turns me on, so she knows what they are, she just won't do them otherwise (I think because she feels like ""I'm admitting he's right"" or something).  I couldn't really take it anymore because the failed sex attempts were just so damaging to me and the lack of sex really started to mess with my head and make me irritable and on edge, so I started to take Cialis (no prescription) which enabled me to get turned on without needing her to make much effort and I at least would be able to avoid the sex failures and have sex regularly. But, I feel like this just ""gets me off"" so I can avoid some of the negative consequences of sex deprivation. I don't know what to do with this anymore, she is stubborn, she won't talk about sex in a serious way, she is very smart and will turn things back on me and deny reality (""I have been trying my best for 30 mins this is not my fault""-reality is 2mins of the above description and she knows it) and I have just been bludgeoned into submission from this. The biggest help I could get from writing this would be from a woman that was like this at some point and can tell me how you changed and why you were like this to begin with?

1364976817.0,29,self.DeadBedrooms,1bkrko,TIL how much it sucks to be stuck in an almost sexless relationship.,34,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1bkrko/til_how_much_it_sucks_to_be_stuck_in_an_almost/,"First time posting here. I've been lurking for a while. I'll try to touch on everything I feel is important, and I'm sorry if this turns into a long rant.

I'm a 24 year old female and I'm currently in a relationship with a 29 year old man. I have been with him for about 3 years. This is the first man I ever had sex with. I had other boyfriends before him, but I never had sex with them. Before him, I was afraid of sex. But he showed be how it could be fun and not scary. After a short while, I even started learning how to do oral sex, which he really enjoyed. I didn't like it much at first, but I quickly grew to enjoy pleasing with my mouth as well as my body. And we didn't stop there. As we became more adventurous I let him finish in my mouth after oral, I let him go down on me (which he didn't seem to enjoy :() and once I even let him try anal. 

There is nothing I won't do to pleasure him. He used to always be the one who initiated the sex, several times a week. Not 2 times a day or even every day, but very regularly. Enough that I was satisfied, anyway. As I became more confident, I began initiating sex as well. I don't have a super HL, but these days I am definitely the HL partner out of the two of us. 

I think it was in October of last year when this problem first arose. A week came and went without any sexy times. After about 2 weeks without sex, I brought it up to him. He just shrugged it off, saying he just didn't feel like it. I let it go then, thinking he would come around. But when more than three weeks passed with no action, I began to get more vocal. One day I brought it up to him and we ended up in an argument. 

I feel like I'm rambling, and I haven't even gotten to the worst things yet. I'll try to wrap this up quickly.

Since that first argument, there have been several more, I would say at least one a month. My state of mind has not been great. I am starting to feel more than a little resentful toward him. I feel like his mother. I feed him, do his laundry and clean up after him. He's my child, not my partner.

When we have The Talk, I tell him how his constant rejection makes me feel like absolute shit. He usually counters by telling me sex is not important. This is the same guy that taught me how having sex with someone you love is a wonderful thing.

As I'm writing this, I'm remembering the times he told me he was disappointed in himself for not being able to make me orgasm. I have never been able to orgasm, not even through masturbation. I have heard that it is very difficult for females to orgasm. But I still get fun and pleasure out of sex. I have never ever tried to make him feel bad about not getting me to orgasm. And you know, I was really looking forward to being able to do that with him one day. Seems it won't happen, now. :(

One Friday night, I was horny and super determined to have sex with my boyfriend. After supper, he went upstairs to shower. I hopped in the shower with him, wiggled my sexy bum (he says he really likes my ass) in front of him, let it rub up against his junk. I turned around to see if it was working. He stared back at me with a blank expression, flaccid as ever (in the past, he would have had a raging boner). We finished our shower and went on with the night. He played the crap out of WoW and I went to bed early, sad.

The next morning, I was still horny. I woke up before him and went to the computer room to draw wolfies and kill time until he woke up. When he did, he followed his usual routine; he went to pee and then flopped himself down at his computer. I said good morning and gave him a kiss and stuff and then I flirtatiously nibbled his earlobe. He swatted me away like a fly. My heart sank. Almost in tears, I quietly went to the bedroom to try and calm myself down. 

He comes in a moment later and is all like ""what's wrong?"" I tell him, ""I've been trying to seduce you and it's not working, I feel sad, frustrated, etc."" He turns around and disappears into the bathroom, so I go back to feeling sorry for myself. A moment later he reappears in the doorway, completely naked. Confused, I ask him what he's doing and he replies, ""making you happy.""

I wonder to myself if he really thinks I'm going to throw myself at him after he rejected me and hurt my feelings. I start to cry. Loudly. My heart is fucking breaking. ""I was all ready to go last night and this morning,"" I managed between sobs. ""And you rejected me both times. Now that I'm all upset you decide to give me some pity sex. Like it's some chore that you need to get out of the way. I don't want to be a chore, I want you to WANT me!""

I don't mean, ""only once a month"", I mean 0. Nothing. Nada. No PIV. I can't even remember the last time I got oral, at least 4 years. I do get a pity handjob about once a month. 

I have become incredibly frustrated. I love my wife but her libido has been completely destroyed by birth control (which she hasn't been on in years), weight gain, anxiety, and anti-depressants. It also doesn't help that it physically hurts her to have sex (her hips), and unless she is turned on it hurts her vagina. So pity sex is out of the question, obviously.

I have had the talk with her already. About 2 years ago, and again 6 months ago. She agreed to see a doctor, try harder, the usual story. That lasted about 4 days.

Now don't get me wrong. I love my wife. I want to be intimate with her, but that will never happen. I have tried initiating, I have tried being very passive, I have tried praying to the old gods. Nothing has worked. I am frustrated beyond belief. I have never and don't want to cheat, but to be honest at this point I think I would if given the opportunity. I don't know if it would be ""cheating"" anymore, the ""game"" is over.

The usual responses are ""I'm tired"", ""I'm dirty"", ""I just took a shower and don't want to get dirty"", ""I have a headache"". There is just no desire to be found. Even when I do get ""something"", it is obviously she is bored and it makes it really hard for me to finish.

As I said I still love her, she is still my best friend, and I don't want to hurt her. I'm afraid that due to her anxiety she has become so dependent on me, I don't know what she would do if I left. This has make it really difficult to make the decision to leave. But, I have come to the conclusion that I can't be happy if I don't have intimacy in my life.

I need to decide if I want to be broke with the potential to be happy, or miserable and financially comfortable. ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_19zhez,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19zhez/i_think_i_give_up_30m/,

The first year she was really dominant and open sexually.  She'd initiate sex at least once a day and we'd frequently do oral, 69, anal, sex in public, bj/hj in the car, try crazy positions etc etc.  

But this variety has gradually dropped away.  By year two we weren't doing oral at all anymore and she mentioned that she thinks both giving and receiving oral is gross and degrading.  Naturally this was a shock to me since previously we could barely go one car ride together without her unzipping me and going for a playful bj/teasing me while driving.

By year three we were pretty much down to vanilla misisonary sex, she'd almost never initiate sex anymore, and now it was down to me to get her in the mood, initiate, and do all the work being on top.  Not to mention deal psychologically with her increasingly high rejection-rate and growing disinterest/apparent boredom.

Now, it's year four and we've pretty much stopped having sex altogether.  Long story short: she's never in the mood, she actively sabotages my attempts at foreplay (keeps watching and laughing at the TV, checking her phone, for example), and I'm over doing all the work/being the pathetic lap-dog guy grovelling for sex. 

I've tried talking to her about how different our sex life is compared to the first year, but it's like she honestly doesn't remember being that horny and adventurous or accuses me of making things up to get her to do things she doesn't want to, or that I'm trying to make her feel guilty.

I just don't know what to do.  I honestly feel like she gave me the old 'bait and switch' by initially pretending to be something sexually that she just wasn't.  I doubt that was her active intention, but it's hard not to feel tricked when I'm lying awake staring at the back of her non-responsive head night after sexless night.

Honestly I feel like I just want to break up with her, but I feel like it's for such a shallow 'typical horny guy' reason.  Am I being unreasonable?  What should I do?

After the birth of our second child we went two years before having sex again, and after that was very intermittent for another 5 years or so, around the DB ""threshold"" level of 10 times a year.

It caused me a high degree of distress and I tried all the strategies - Married Man Sex Life approach, not initiating, all day flirting, cuddling with no expectations etc etc

Things never improved for long, if at all.

I remember one night going for a walk on my own and breaking down in tears just knowing that this relationship would NEVER be what I wanted. In my heart I knew the type of connection that was possible with a woman and I yearned so deeply for it. Just sobbing with the grief of it all.

My 10 year relationship ended about 18 months ago - it was a mutual decision to separate and it too was a baptism by fire. Very difficult emotions, grief, feelings of loneliness, inadequacy etc

And then finding out that she had met a new partner and me of course assuming that they were having an amazing sex life, that he could fuck her in ways I never could. That he had what it takes, that he was a ""real"" man.

But then one day I woke up totally in the clear, feeling great to be single, full of optimism about the future. It was such a sudden shift after months and months of negative emotions. It was though all that emotion had burned itself out.

And just recently I met a new woman and we've really hit it off. Our sex life is mind-blowing, it's beautiful and intimate and sensitive and exquisite. Everything I knew in my heart that a love relationship could be. I didn't see it coming and after years of deprivation, I feel so excited about life again. It's amazing and easy.

I should add that I'm 45 with 2 kids.

I'm writing this not to gloat or to encourage people to just leave their DB partner but hopefully as a reminder that we never really know what lies around the corner and that as dire as your situation is right now, it is as worse as it gets. It can only get better.

I know when I was in the depths of my DB, that I couldn't envisage the way my life is now. That's the insidious thing about a DB - it slowly grinds you down, and the future seems grim and dark.

I don't hold anything against her, I know she works hard for our children and me and makes our home a happy place, we're just in odd wavelengths right now and I think what she told me made me think more about the way I show affection and her desire for me to make out, but be more spontaneous and not just touch her with the sole objective of having sex.

So I began to initiate with my wife a few nights ago.  We've had a DB for a couple years now, averaging once a month.   Last month, a rarity, it happened 3 times, I'm guessing to a new light-hearted approach to disagreements, some time off I took so we could be together, and things like that.  

Last week we couldn't do anything, due to shark week.  I did suggest we could do things, sex didn't have to be about penetration, but that didn't pan out.

But as soon as she is good, I start to initiate.  As with most of the time, she says she is tired.  OK, I understand.  I won't make a big deal out of it since doing so in the past only led to more arguments and suffering.  She added ""Just let things happen naturally"".

This phrase alone scares me.  If I let things happen naturally, are we going to be stuck at 1x per month?  If so, letting things just happen naturally doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

Then I get dropped another phrase.  ""Please don't leave me""

Still time to ask for help with recent developments on DB. I'll outline the history of the situation first:

* Me, M24 and her, F21; together for 2 years

* She enjoys it when I go down on her and has orgasms. Other than that, she was not interested in sex at all. There's only a few occasions where she claimed otherwise, but I can't see any passion in her.

* only very occasional sex the first 1 year, now an almost completely DB for 8 months (she gives me a weekly chore-ish handjob, I'm 'happy' to perform oral on her also once a week)

(In the last thread, I also talked about her psychotherapist and how she refused to talk to her about sex in depth. A few days after, they actually did talk about it for like 20 minutes, conclusion: the therapist believes my girlfriend is not attracted to me but could be attracted to other men.)

*Now here's the current story:*

Starting with September I started NoFap and we didn't see each other for a few days (visiting our parents). Around 10 days ago we met again and my increased sex drive caused *a Talk*.
My plan to stop fapping made her feel uncomfortable and she complained that if I continued, and refused receiving chore handjobs too, it will create problems because it denies her the chance to sexually please me.
All of this initiated *the Talk* and I made some really good points about how I am not blaming her, sex is about bonding, and suggested once again that we could try ""cuddle sex"" which is my idea of slowly intensifying cuddling. At first, she was baffled when she realized I could be happy with sexual but non-penetrative activity. Then we talked about how she could try getting off the NuvaRing (hormonal BC) to see if it would awaken her libido and that if it would work, she could get an IUD instead. She got pissed and insulted me (""you can't just pause using the NuvaRing for a month, it would mess with the hormones!"" / ""WTF do you think, I need to be on BC to avoid pregnancy"" / ""you didn't pay attention in school! you can only implant IUDs in 40-year-old moms!"").

So there was all but love in the air and when we had our good-night cuddle session an hour later, she revealed she was angry at me for confronting her with sex and said a few things I didn't want to hear. Let me quote the key statements:

* *Maybe the therapist is right and it's not my fault but yours in that I am just not attracted to you. Maybe it would work with someone else and I would want to have sex. Maybe I just have to try that.*

* *There's nothing we can do unless I am in a sexual mood, that includes naked cuddling because it will make you horny and I don't want that*

* *I don't think I will ever be in the mood again with you*

* *With this problem persisting, I see our relationship going down the drain*

She also said that if it weren't for the sex, the relationship would not be doomed and could continue. So the beta part of my brain gave in and told her that I wouldn't end things over sex.

In conclusion, I am really feeling low right now. A week ago she told me I should stop being ""so obsessive"" with going to the gym because ""obviously it doesn't help anyways, you still look like when you started 8 months ago"" (I had only small results because of my diet, but the +6lbs muscle make me feel a lot different)

Two days ago she gave me a handjob and therefore my NoFap streak of more than 30 days is lost. When I came, she let it drop on my belly and refused to help me clean it up. Instead I hear ""haha, now one month's progress is gone"".

The dog gets more kisses than I. When I do, it's only pecks, no ""sloppy"" kisses; she says I have bed breath (it's true) even half an hour after brushing my teeth and applying mouthwash. Got my last french kiss around a year ago, it lasted 4 seconds.

When we cuddle, she will lay her head on my chest. Anything more, like stroking my back, is too much work for her (she's tired), the only spontaneous thing she does is kneading my ears because she likes that (I don't) and it reminds her of doggy ears.

I also begin to believe she might have feelings for me similar to those a daughter would have for her father. I offer emotional stability, safety, help her with pretty much everything, ... But then again, she didn't have a sex drive in her first relationship either.


Now I realize this sounds very frustrated and like an unstructured rant (which it is) and most will recommend to leave. But to be really honest, I don't think I am emotionally capable of leaving. Reasons being my remaining love for her and self esteem issues. The latter because I am not the most attractive guy, probably a 3-4/10. I do plan on improving that by having a plastic surgery (recommended by my orthodontist, don't worry, it's something really legitimate).

**TL;DR / recap of relevant information: girlfriend has no drive and has never felt sexual desire for anyone. She's not open to getting off BC and does not want to try sexual activity unless she is in the mood, which never happened in the last 8 months and she claims is not very likely to suddenly happen in the future.**

**So how do I deal with this situation?** I would like to continue NoFap. But I can't even stand her running around the house naked after taking a shower. I can't cuddle without my mind telling me to kiss her passionately. All of this makes me incredibly desperate. Should I just ask her for regular handjobs? They are a lot worse than fapping myself but at least I can touch her breasts when receiving them.
Or could it even be an option to ask her for chore sex and make it so pleasing for her that she agrees to have regular sexytimes, could that work?

my husband has always been LL. after the birth of our child he said he was no longer attracted to me because of the weight i gained, though he loved me more than ever. after losing the weight, and him saying he was interested, he still never wanted to have sex. it got to the point i just resigned myself to a sexless marriage and did what i could to make sure the rest of our relationship was great. after almost 5 years of no sex, my husband went on hormone replacement therapy and we now have an active sex life again (yay). 

one thing i've heard a lot from LL partners is that they want to feel closeness and intimacy BEFORE they can feel motivated to have sex. they want to feel appreciated and loved, and not just feel like a sex object.

but this is what they NEED to know: there is a level of intimacy and closeness that can only be achieved from having sex. i know this because i'm living it right now.

even though (apart from the no sex) my husband and i had a great relationship - you know, the whole ""we're best friends, no one understands me like him/her, we always have fun together, etc"" it wasn't until we started having sex again that things got even better. and that's because the act of sex - the actual intimacy required and sharing of a loving experience cannot be duplicated in any other format. and when you are that open and vulnerable and loving with your spouse, it improves the relationship. you are once again a couple (that's why sex is a coupling). you are no longer just two best friends in a household.

of course not every case/person is the same. but i have to tell you that my husband, after a week of sex, told me ""i feel like we're deeply in love again"". and the ONLY thing that changed was we were now having sex.

NSFW language.,34,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/v5dx5/no_sex_a_tale_of_selfimposed_woe_nsfw_language/,"I'm a female in her mid 20's, dating a guy the same age.  We have been together for a long time.  I just need to rant.  I'm going to be really harsh on my boyfriend, but it will calm me down in the end.  I'd rather explode to the internet than to him.

We went out on a date night last night.  Only last minute, it turned out that his parents were coming too.  Instead of getting to be all over each other for just a few fucking minutes (I was all dressed up and just begging for it), we got to sit chastely and exchange a few pecks.  I don't think I can remember the last time we made out.

The whole time, we were surrounded by young girls wearing all kinds of racy things and draped over their boyfriends laps.  The ones who weren't were flaunting themselves, checking everyone out.  I was close to tears pretty much the entire time, just anticipating the failed sex we'd have later in the night.  The constant barrage of my subconscious was almost too much to take.  I'm not good enough, I'm not 18 anymore, I'm not skinny enough, I've started getting smile lines around my mouth.  My tits aren't big enough, my ass isn't round enough.  And even if I was perfect, he's used to me.  I'm old news. 

He was very good about not gawking.  When it's been almost a month without sex, I start to fly off the handle when he checks out other girls.  He complimented me lavishly, held my hand, put his arm around me when I wanted him to.  He makes all the right moves; he just DOESN'T FUCK ME. 

Sometimes I just want to tell someone.  I imagine the whole conversation in my head.  *So last night I stuffed myself into some lacy underwear and a dress that barely fit around my breasts.  I even wore pigtails.  I plied my boyfriend with drinks and flirting and he still DIDN'T FUCK ME.*

Oh, and there's always the excuse.  Last night, after our ruined date, he wanted to hang out with his friends for the first time in a while.  So if I'd said no, I would become the fun-crusher girlfriend.  The one who never lets him see his friends because she nags him about stupid romantic things like date night.  I get to see him all the time; how could I be such a heartless bitch to keep him from his friends?  

So he stayed out late with them and when we got home, he was tired and stressed about work today.  So he DIDN'T FUCK ME.  Surprise, surprise!  I'm leaving tomorrow and we won't see each other for the next few weeks.  Maybe he'll force himself to get into the mood for sex tonight, but I'm going to turn him down.  I don't want his pity fuck.  I want to be wanted.  I want him to see me in a skimpy dress and tear that shit off my body.  I don't want to go down on him for 20 minutes so he can get a semi and try to fuck me with it.

What can I do?",30,6,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1jzzq5/after_being_married_for_14_years_my_wife_tells_me/,"I'm not sure this is the right place to post this, but here goes. I want to preface this immediately with the following: Neither I, nor my wife want a divorce. 

That said, here's my story. I'll try not to make it super long, but...yeah.

My wife and I got married in 1999. Our sex life wasn't mind blowing, but it was good. Steady, I think is the best word for it. About a year after getting married my wife was diagnosed with PCOS, which hasn't helped our sex life, but we dealt with it. We were pretty much getting busy 2 times a week.

We held off on having kids until we'd be married for 9 years (yes...I've made that connection too...and well I guess it was actually more like 8 years: we lost one baby)

My wife was sexually and emotionally abused as a child so she's never been super into sex, but she certainly got in the mood, and while I'd love to have porn-star sex, I was more than happy to take it easy. I love my wife. I love her so, so much; it's beyond words.

But...

In January we moved to a new state, and things got really tense and weird. She was getting really distant. Sex was becoming extremely impersonal, and I was starting to get really paranoid. We had a major, MAJOR fight in March. I mean we've never fought like that before. We pretty much made a scene in a restaurant, on a night that was supposed to be a date-night as my parents were in town and offered to watch our daughter while we went out. 

There was screaming, yelling, etc. Since we moved for her ""dream job"" I felt discarded. I felt like she got everything she had wanted out of life and no longer needed me.

And the distance continued to grow. I had no idea why. We made up. Apologized, etc. July we ended up at each other's throats again. I felt like she was having an affair. She had to be, but then she dropped it on me: for the past 5 years she had not been in love with me romantically. I was now like a brother to her. Someone she cared about and loved, but there was zero sexual attraction. 

This killed me. I mean killed me. I am devoted to my wife. She's the most gorgeous person in the world to me: inside and out. I also strongly attracted to her. That was July 4th. We had sex that weekend, but we haven't since. And the sex was pretty much just me using her like a masturbation aid. It was demoralizing. We used to sleep naked and cuddle all the time. She puts on as much clothing as she can stand at night now. 

We used to shower together. If I get in the shower with her now, she immediately is ""done"" and gets out. 

I'm just at the end of my rope. We're in our late 30's, and I know that thing will slow down, but I didn't expect things to completely come to a halt before I was 40. 

She refuses to see a therapist. Refuses to see any kind of doctor about this (I suspect there is a depression / hormonal  issue at work). She does nothing, but apologize. ""I'm sorry I'm not a better wife."" Ugh! I'm so sick of hearing that, because she seems to think that just apologizing makes it all better.

This post I guess is part just needing to get this off my chest and part wanting advice. What can I do?

A bit of background: we've been dealing with this problem for most of the relationship. Have done the doctors, the pills, the props and toys. Nothing has worked and we're down to one attempt at sex every few months.  He can't get hard enough for sex unless I give him a full-on BJ and jump on it before it changes its mind.

I had a bit of a shit up-bringing. Parents split it was messy and nasty and I was stuck in the middle.

Now I crave my wife to want me like she did when we first started dating. 

We still have sex a few times a week, but it's always the same, I initiate we go through the motions and finish. Every time I mention ""lets try this"" or ""Lets try in another room"" it's shot down. 

Now the only thing I'd like some help with is to get her to understand that I'm CRAVING to be desired. I work out, I'm in great shape and she comments as such, but nothing changes. If I don't initiate it'll never happen. If we have ""the talk"" she initiates that night, which consists of her getting in bed naked then resuming the norm, then it goes back to never initiating.

Every time I try to tell her that somethings missing, that I would love her to WANT me, she says that I'm just being needy because of the way I didn't get any affection being brought up, and in arguments she's stated that maybe she can't give me the attention I deserve.

I don't think I'm asking a lot though, It's not frequency at all, it's just... I don't know... I want her to POUNCE on me every once in a while. I want her to grab at my junk even just once like she used to when we were dating, but instead it's almost like a business transaction.

DB for over 12 years.  Married with kids.  Tried counselling.  Learned that our sex life **was** in the top 2% (she climaxed EVERY FUCKING TIME).  Learned that our sex life **now** is in the bottom 2% (only have sex once every 2 months or so).  Actually, my favourite thing is to please my partner so I only really count **her** orgasms, which takes me to once per 3 years.
      
My wife refuses to have sex in bed now.  She will only have sex in the shower.  I can't please her in the shower.  I can barely please myself in the shower.  She is much shorter than me, so it's hard to make things work.  I hate it because I just feel like I am just being serviced by her, and only barely.  It's like a mockery of a healthy sex life.  The more I have sex with her, the more bitter I get.  She just doesn't get it!
    
The last time in the shower, I was behind her and kept slipping out of her vagina.  She turned around and tried to grip my shaft ""to make it as big as it could be.""  Well, fuck, we're not designed to have shower sex.  If she wants it to work, she could lose weight on her ass, bend over more, arch her back, or try a different location than the shower that **doesn't** accentuate the difference in our heights.  
     
Her super nice way of pointing out that all our problems would be resolved if I had a bigger cock is the absolute icing on the cake.  I'm average size.  Not big, not small, average.  I've always been the same size. In the past, I've given her orgasms galore.  She has just lost her appetite for anything that actually works.
      
So I am only guessing, but I think she has decided that sex is dirty, or that shower sex means she doesn't have to be wet in the vagina.  I am reaching the conclusion that it is just a horrible substitute for real sex, where each person should have a little bit more interest in their partner's pleasure than their own.
     
Sex on her terms is deluded, ineffective and unhealthy.  I have been telling myself that this is the only sexual thing that she volunteers to do, so I should support it.  I have now decided that it's not getting us anywhere.  She needs to try harder and show that she cares about me, our relationship, and her own pleasure.
     
If she absolutely doesn't have any desire to put in effort in this regard, I think I'm ready to thrown in the towel and start having relationships with other women.  Goddamnit I've been the proper english fucking gentleman declining opportunities from other women.  Now I think I have been the biggest herpy derpy sap in the world.
    
Why should I obsess myself with this one delusional, unhealthy woman?  98% of the female population has a stronger sex drive than her.  
       
I can stay with her and stay with the kids and keep other relationships on the down low.  But damnit, why should I keep selling myself out to someone's completely abhorrent, abnormal, aberrant views in this regard?

Both of us have been up and down with our libidos, but in the past few years a combination of her aging, (she's 48, I'm 50) and her anti-depression meds have pushed her desired frequency of sex to about 1-2 times a month, while mine is 2-3 times a week. We're both in pretty good shape for our age, and we're both attracted to each other, just at different intervals.

When we had sex at her frequency, she generally enjoyed it, and had a good orgasm. But when she made an effort to meet in the middle, she was usually angry or sexually frustrated. She couldn't have an orgasm consistently, and the fact that she wasn't very turned on would bring out her ""everything must be perfect to fuck"" side, where in order to try to have an orgasm, she'd have to be perfectly aligned on the bed, foreplay would have to go exactly right, etc. In short, the ""extra"" sex times were mostly the cause of anger and resentment for both of us.  I'd feel frustrated because I was spending more time trying to unlock the key to her fickle vagina than enjoying sex, and she was frustrated because she didn't want to be there in the first place.

We've both talked and talked about this, and made many different efforts to try to work around it. I think if each of us were perfectly honest, we'd fess up that we're both selfish in bed. I like to fuck a pornstar and when she's turned on sometimes she likes being a pornstar - she deepthroats, wears slutty underwear, and on special occasions takes it up the ass. But she wants to have the kind of sex she likes (pornstar or not pornstar, it involves her being turned on and having an orgasm) if she's going to engage in any sex act. So the usual ""give the guy a handjob"" advice isn't part of our sex life. She's tried it a couple of times but she clearly wasn't much into it, plus, frankly, I'd rather just beat off than have a half-hearted handie.

Her depression is under pretty good control, but it does figure into the whole issue. When she's depressed she can still function in life, but in the bedroom, forget it. So every year or two there is a month or six weeks where she's completely sexually unavailable, which added to my overall frustration with the situation.

Outside of the bedroom we're very compatible, we don't fight about money, we agree on parenting, and we enjoy each other's company. This is still true, more or less, even after what I'll call ""the smothering"".

So, up until last year, I felt that our relationship was pretty good. Other than sex, we're a pretty good match, and since the sex was pretty good on occasion, my previous pattern with her has been to be the supplicant. If only I could cajole, beg, compromise, talk, etc. to increase the frequency a bit, everything would be good. 

During vacations we'd usually have more sex, but last summer's vacation was an exception (once was enough for the whole week, for her), and that made me have a ""what the fuck am I doing"" moment. Why was I going through constant rejection for a couple of sex acts per month? Was sex really that important that I should occupy so much of my time trying to get it from her? Did I want to feel so goddam powerless? Could I just cut it out of the equation and still enjoy the good parts of our relationship?

So what I did, and I'm by no means proud of it, was to try to turn off my sexual interest in her completely. I'm one of those guys so hung up on their sex partner that I masturbate thinking about her and our previous sex acts. So, instead of fantasizing about the porn star sex we'd sometimes have, I started watching more porn and willing myself to fantasize about the women in porn vids. I beat off more often to drain my sexual interest. I also stopped sleeping in her bed and completely cut off any mention or discussion of sex. I smothered my desire for her, for lack of a better term.

(I should mention that she snores, so sometimes I'd sleep in the other bedroom. I started sleeping there exclusively, blaming the snoring (which was legit), so we wouldn't have a blow up over it. Again, she is not obese - she has mild sleep apnea not related to weight, she's seen the sleep specialist, she's not ready to wear a CPAP every night.)

At the start of the smothering, she'd half-heartedly mention it, and once in a while try to initiate it, but I'd just say I wasn't interested. She also went through a depression (unrelated to the sex smothering, I know for a fact), so there was the usual six weeks that she didn't want to have sex.  The long and short of it is that we had no sex for months, probably the longest period in our whole relationship.

I was pretty proud of my restraint - the only time I gave in was during a spring break vacation in February where I fucked her once because I wasn't getting my usual jack-off time. She came in about 1 minute and talked like a porn star when I fucked her. But when I proposed another fuck a day or two later, no dice. Can't blame her, she got her two weeks worth.

After we got back, there was one time when she basically demanded sex after we had gone out and both had a couple of drinks. I fucked her, she came, I didn't. Then, yesterday, she wanted it again, and cajoled me into fucking her when the kids were out. I did it but I didn't come and had a hard time keeping it up, and she was frustrated with the whole thing when it was over.

A little under a year ago, I was someone who was always hard as a rock when she was teasing me, someone who was begging to fuck her quite often, someone who always came when we fucked, but I was in a state of fairly constant sexual frustration. Today, with her, I'm a limp-dicked, sexually indifferent, compulsive masturbator with retarded ejaculation, but I'm not sexually frustrated anymore.

Are things better? I'm not sure. Now I'm going to decide where I want to go from here. I've been improving my masturbatory technique by edging and watching the kind of porn I like to the point where I'm more satisfied than I was. Maybe that's short term, but it's where I'm at.

BTW, though I'm sure I come off as the world's most insensitive asshole in this post, I know that she has a different point of view and her list of issues and problems with our sex life would probably be as compelling or more compelling than mine. The point is that we talked and tried and failed to come to some mutual, workable sex life, not that one of us is right and the other is wrong. And, no, neither of us wants to fuck someone else.

It's been great.

On Monday, I was super horny and frustrated and decided, fuck it, at this point what do I have to lose? I gave up my dignity and threw the anxiety of possible rejection to the wind: I texted him saying I wanted his cock and for him to come home. I did my makeup all nice, put on a cute skirt (forgoing panties) and waited for him, knowing there wasn't much chance it would do anything. When when he got home, I was flashing him and teasing him all evening... because at that point, I honestly, really felt like I might as well: I was used to rejection. But ... it worked. He was really into it, too, no ""throwing you a bone"" kind of attitude: it was really intense and dirty and great.

And it happened again, too, yesterday. He's been holding my hand and smacking my ass ever since, and talking about doin' it all day today, too.

My guard's not all the way down; I know this is a continuous effort, and it's something I will continue to work on. I'm sure rough patches will reoccur, but this is a huge victory for me, and I'm going to enjoy it for now. I feel... tentatively hopeful.

I can't do this anymore. It's been nearly 2 years of this one-sided relationship. I've yelled, I've talked, I've reasoned, bargained, begged, and cried. Oh, how I've cried. But now, I'm just angry. How dare you. How dare you ruin the best thing I've ever felt and made it into the worst thing I've ever felt. Cheating would have been better, at least then I wouldn't feel rejected. I know you want to want me. I wanted that too. But now I realize that the coldness I feel between us when we lay in bed is growing colder and colder. I feel it. I feel the ice. You pull closer when I pull away. I want the distance because to trust you again would mean being hurt again. 

But I can't keep feeling sorry for myself, this is no longer about your hurting me. I'm just hurting myself. Always feeling unwanted and undesirable. The wasted waxing, the fancy underwear. New makeup. New hair, new clothes, new body. But the same old me. None of this can change me, and I realize that now. The outside can't change the inside. I walk around with a thinly veiled attempt at confidence. *Confidence*. Being *sexy*. What is this? I can't recall the last time I felt this strange feeling of empowerment. We have sex, I feel bad, the cycle repeats. I can't accept any of your efforts anymore. I don't even remember what true acceptance is. I'm always trying to be different, to be new, not boring. All for you. But now I'm acknowledging that I'm not what you wanted. 

I know this will hurt you, and it hurts me. I don't want to be cruel, but I'm *so* angry. I almost want you to feel the pain that I've felt, but what's done is done. I write this post and get it all out for once and for all. No more tears, sadness, hope, rejection, disappointment. I deserve a great love and so do you. I don't want to be away from you. I want to stay with you because I crave your approval. I want you to pick me up, spin me around, and tell me all is well. Tell me that I'm perfect for you. But *why?*. Why do I crave approval from the one person who denies me? 

I can't say I'll always love you, but I can say I'll think of you often. Whether good or bad, this experience has changed me. I don't want to ever go through this again. No one ever should. I am trying to find hope for the future. I know it's there. I can't become jaded, I won't. I believe in love, respect, happiness, the whole thing. I will leave you and leave this whole thing behind knowing I've done my best. But I can't keep waiting for you. I know I'll be waiting an eternity.

I was just wondering, those of you who have ever managed to resolve your dB situation has it stayed fixed?

I ask because it seems like my situation has fixed, she has changed her birth control and found one which suits her better and has also lost a lot of weight and our sex life has changed from being once a month (if I was lucky!) to a few times a week. Also her whole attitude to sex has changed back to what it was when we first got together, she is up for oral again and willing to experiment.

But even though its now been about 9 months since everything changed there is  a part of me that will always fear that it will return. We are talking about trying for kids from next year onwards but I'm afraid if she gets pregnant and doesn't lose the pregnancy weight the dB will come back with a vengeance and now I will be trapped by a child!

1358942552.0,28,self.DeadBedrooms,1749lp,I went through a year of acceptance but snapped last night.,32,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1749lp/i_went_through_a_year_of_acceptance_but_snapped/,"It had been 14 months since the last talk. I came away from that  accepting that I was making a choice between being a family man who is unsatisfied or being single and starting again (but not being the father I want to be). I chose family and I have been happy with that. I have been trying with some minor results to be the best man that I can be to improve the DB.

So last night came as a bit of surprise. We climbed in to our cold bed at the same time and my wife is wearing knickers, leggings, T-shirt and night dress all underneath both a winter duvet and a summer duvet. As we snuggle up to gather some warmth I began to feel deep sadness that I am denied any skin to skin contact. I love to feel her body against mine. It's not about sex, it's intimacy. 

I thought back to earlier in the evening when she was repelled as I kissed her neck. As though it sent sparks of sex or intimacy that were plainly unwelcome.

She sensed my sudden change in mood and in as an unromantic way as possible offered me duty/sympathy sex. I declined, I need more than that, much more.

We talked the same old talk, but now we have cleared a great number of life's hurdles, so there was a distinct lack of excuses for her to fall back on. We are left with her job stress, self/body image &amp; general tiredness. Or it could be me.

She likes her job, but it can be a little difficult sometimes. This should be what everyone strives for in a career. It's ideal!

I love her body, but she wants to be thinner and more toned. She doesn't have a media friendly body, but who has? I do encourage her to work out and eat healthy, it helps you to feel good and have more energy. Really, body image is just a state of mind.

Tiredness is the default setting for working parents, but only if you choose to succumb to it. She think she manipulates it by getting up extremely early unnecessarily everyday.

Me? I'm 6'5'', workout, I'm clean, play soccer, have a respectable career, don't go out with the boys very often, do my bit in the home and don't drink much either. I could be a little more assertive. We've lived in her country Finland for 2 years now and I don't and will never speak much Finnish, so I am a little dependant. That's the one area I can work on.

What I really believe is the problem is that she thinks it's me who is in the wrong with my HL and not wanting sex or intimacy is perfectly normal for mothers and it would be weird to try and change that. Going back to my last post in the summer http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/13jc5g/competing_with_children_for_affection/ , that's the unnecessary battle between child and neglected parent. That's why I chose to accept my fate 14 months back.

So now, my acceptance has been withdrawn, it's time to have that honeymoon we never had, to get some weekends away and get a local babysitter. Lack of cooperation will lead to separation. I've booked a hotel for Saturday in a country park near her mother's place, babysitter is confirmed. Let's see if we can turn this ship around, before we hit an iceberg?

1350085440.0,25,self.DeadBedrooms,11e40o,Just cheated for the first time after years of DB.,40,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/11e40o/just_cheated_for_the_first_time_after_years_of_db/,"I've been lurking here for a while. My wife and I are in our late 20's. We've been married for 3 1/2 years and together for just a little over 5. 


I don't know if you could really call our situation a dead bedroom, but I'm certainly unsatisfied and have been probably since the beginning. We have sex fairly regularly 2 or 3 times a month. While that certainly isn't as often as I'd like, it might be enough if I actually enjoyed it. 


I read an article today that describes my situation perfectly and I wish I could find it now. It basically describes a guy who married his wife because on paper she looked great...educated, pretty, motivated in life, loves all the same things that I do. This is my wife and I. We look like a perfect match, but I feel almost no connection with her.


The one point we have never been on the same page as sex. When we were dating sex was still very vanilla, but she'd put some effort into it. She'd dress up in cute little outfits wearing no underwear, hell... I used to occasionally get blow jobs. We used to switch up positions and things were a little interesting although not where I would have preferred. I always assumed that since she fit the bill in so many other arenas I could ignore the boring sex and just deal with it. 


Over the past couple of years the sex has gotten progressively worse. When we were dating she would occasionally let me touch her breasts and we would make out some. That's all gone now. I get the occasional gift of kissing a nipple as a reward for doing something she wants around the house. Sex is almost always had with a bra and shirt on. It has to be in one position and if I'm not doing the exact right thing, she gives me this look like its the most horrible thing she's ever done. 


We've had talks and arguments about this on many occasions. To her credit she tries every now and again, but it never lasts. I've always been the guy to make sure my woman gets off during sex. It's my view that I'm going to get off anyways, so I want to make sure she gets hers before I do. That being said...I've not once gotten her off. I've tried, but I'm convinced her actions won't allow me to. She refuses to let me go down on her (an act I enjoy immensely) or to even touch her down there. We've tried vibrators and they still don't work. She has no problem getting herself of when I'm not around. She can't even get herself off when I'm in the room, laying on the bed next to her, so she's obviously got some issues. She's been to therapy before and I think that's the only reason she can have sex at all. 


Prior to being with her I was always able to satisfy my partner and had pretty good self esteem about my sexual prowess. With her I feel so undesirable, inadequate, and honestly..less of a man. The few times she has let me touch her down there she looks at me like she couldn't be more bored and she can't wait for me to stop. The whole reason she ever let me at all was as birthdays presents or other rewards. She's taken all the fun out of me giving my lover pleasure. 


Earlier this year I started browsing the usual sites...AshleyMadison, adultfriendfinder, pof. About two weeks ago a woman contacted me on one of these sites. We chatted for a few days and eventually met up at her place (she's another with a DB who's husband is away on business for weeks at a time.) We had absolutely mind-blowing sex...the kind I haven't had since before I met my wife. We're planning another meeting again.


Prior to meeting this woman I was seriously considering leaving my wife and we almost split up several months ago. Now..I'm certain I can't live my life like this much longer. On one hand I feel like a jerk for wanting to split up a marriage because I'm not getting good sex. On the other, I know that leaving is the right thing for both of us, mainly because of the resentment our DB has caused. 


The only real decision left for me is when and how to break it off. Her ex just left one day and she only ever interacted with his lawyer after that. She's said that she was happy this is how he did it and I'm considering the same method. I'm also trying to determine if I should wait for a bit until she's done with a school program she's in right now. Who knows...I might just wait until we have another big fight and bring it up then. I don't plan on telling her I was unfaithful, but do plan on being honest about the reason I want out. 


Sorry if that was a bit all over the place...it's kind of tough to put all of the history and my feelings into a logical, concise manner.



UPDATE: Well I started going through the process of leaving this morning. I put an attorney on retainer and jut signed a lease at a new apartment. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified, but I know things will work out soon.

UPDATE 2: Just got done telling her that I'm leaving. It was fucking tough! Hardest thing I've ever done. She cried, got angry, pleaded, and finally accepted. I got my dog, computer, and a few other important things out. I just hope she doesn't try to fight me too hard on equitable division. I feel like a weight has been lifted, but at the same time sad, and most of all… scared. I know things will be ok, it's just going to take time.

I seem to have several problems that lead me to not being interested in sex with my husband (I'm female). I've read several books on sex and sexual problems, but have not found success, because I'm afraid to change and also because I have so many issues I didn't know what to focus on first. 

I'm in full-on sex therapy now and thought it might be helpful for me to share my experiences, hoping that it might help others.

Some of my issues: I learned to masturbate by accident when I was a teenager by ""grinding"" on a chair, fully clothed (and no hands involved). My body unfortunately got used to that technique for orgasm, which is not conducive to partnered intimacy. I also came to rely on porn rather than internal fantasy for arousal. Another issue is that intercourse is almost always uncomfortable or painful for me due to anxiety and also some physical issues. I'm also very emotionally sensitive...little things that my husband does can put me off from sex very easily. The last big one is that I think I'm afraid of being sexually vulnerable...to let go sexually and allow myself to be THAT close to my husband is really scary because of things that have happened to me in the past...I don't want to be vulnerable and then get hurt emotionally.

So anyways, these are the things that contribute to me not wanting to have and not really enjoying sex, so I try to avoid having it.

I want to point out that reasons for not wanting to have sex can be very complicated and those that don't want it might not understand why they don't want it and it takes a lot of awareness, education, etc. to figure out why.

The basic remedy it seems to me is to have the courage to face one's fears, on step at a time; to create a relaxed environment where there is no pressure to perform or have orgasms; and to try to make most intimate experiences positive ones (rather than negative), even if they don't go exactly right. I think people turn off to sex because the number of bad experiences with it outnumber the good ones and so why would they want to have sex? Sex is supposed to be fun...it's not supposed to be pressured, or obligatory, or make you feel like a failure/unattractive, if it those elements are in the relationship, it just makes things worse.

1334240375.0,24,self.DeadBedrooms,s66q8,"Found this place after ""the talk.""  Well, here goes my story...",30,6,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/s66q8/found_this_place_after_the_talk_well_here_goes_my/,"I've found some camaraderie reading the old posts here.  Here is my story.
Married two years with no children.  Were both PhD students with jobs.  The sex was fantastic when we first met - as in 9 times a day once.  After marriage, the frequency of intercourse dropped precipitously.  We're currently at once every two or three months.

I've had ""the talk"" and it resulted in a remarkably similar result of discussions on finances. This makes them connected issues and worthy of a little backstory.  We both have jobs, but I'm more frugal and cautious with my money due to our financial realities as students.  I've taken the bare minimum out in loans as a result of careful planning, budgeting, purchasing sales and bulk, credit card points, and a difficult job that involves fatalities but pays high amounts in short periods (wont say what it is).  

Unlike me, her job on campus covers tuition (savings of thousands), but she supplements it with the maximum in student loans each year.  I've had ""the talk"" here on wanting to show her basic tools on budgeting and have been met, over years, with ""its not a good time"" and I'm busy.""

Fast forward to my dead bedroom problem, and ""the talk"" was met with the same ""its not a good time"" and I'm busy"" rebuttal.  I've had a mini ""talk"" on sex a year ago or so, and it was met with the same reply.  I've now heard this request to have me put off discussions for years before and after marriage.   This current ""talk"" was prompted by a psychological trigger coming from a weekend of particularly hard work and a concurrent recent realization of how much I dislike masturbation as a simulacrum of human contact, and how it no longer works as a sex placebo.  I was asked to put this off since it wasn't a good time.  

Something within me died and broke.  

Sitting at my computer, something snapped.  I had an out of body experience, and typed up a brief one line email simply with a link to the laws in our state regarding ""constructive abandonment"" and the word divorce. (edit: see below) It was if my subconscious  took over for 5 seconds and communicated with my wife.  Years of repression breaking free in a last ditch effort for communication that is continually delayed and blocked on her part.  

Realizing what had happened, and realizing I could not enter her email to delete the communication,  I went over to the television that she was watching, turned it off, and told her what occurred.  She wore the look of shock.  

She went to bed, and I slept on the couch.  She came back and told me she was sorry.  I told her how hard it was for me to be rejected time and time again after dates, rejecting my efforts to rekindle ""old"" (not old) feelings to recreate things like our old romantic lunches.  I told her how deep it hurt to be rejected repeatedly for sex.  I told her that something had grown cold within me as a result of being asked to bottle my feelings because it was ""a bad time"" and if she wanted to save this relationship, she was going to have to deal with those emotions that I could no longer contain.  

I'm at a point where I'm simply not going to live my live this way.  We do not have kids and I can walk from this with the minimum of damage since we basically have little to no shared marital assets.  I will be on the hook for about $15k of her loans, and I can take that if its a worst case scenario. 

I'm at the end of my rope and she knows that.  She knows that I need a release and i would like an aggressive set of actions on her part, but I don't want her to do anything she doesnt want, since I cannot get into the idea of forced or contrived sexual actions.  Her solution is to have a date this Friday.  I'm still frustrated, and this is only getting worse.   

Edit:
Constructive abandonment is regarding a fault based ground for divorce where the abandoning spouse ""unjustified, willful, and continued, despite repeated requests"" refused to fulfill the basic obligations arising from the marriage contract (in this case, engage in intercourse) for the duration of one year.

I offended a lot of people with my last post, but I put it up there because it is exactly what I wish the ""old me"" could have read.  I needed a shock to the system to tell me that I wasn't looking or acting attractive, and that was causing my low-no-sex situation.  I didn't come here looking for a pity party, I came here looking for specific advice on how to turn things around.

As an update since my last post:

* I've been feeling better about myself every day.  Nothing really changes, it just takes time to overcome depression and get back the ""hakuna matata"", relaxed attitude I used to have towards life.  I guess I could say, my mind believed all the crap I wrote in my last post but it took a few months for my body to start believing it too.

* Because I'm more relaxed and carefree again, I no longer get upset about my dead bedroom situation, and no longer fight about it with my wife.  Communication is key, but I've already said everything that needs saying multiple times.  She knows sex is important to me at this point, and reiterating it every few days doesn't help anything.

* When I am rejected for sex or other intimacy, I used to try to act cool but she could easily read my body language and know it was BS.  Now, I actually am cool about it.  My attitude is ""sex would be great right now, but I've got other shit to do if you aren't interested, don't worry about it, we'll do it some other time"".  I can ask for it all the time, but there isn't any pressure any more.  Feeling pressured was probably the single biggest turn-off for her.

* I read a bunch more PUA / Game / Alpha stuff across the internet, until I felt like I had all the knowledge I needed, and needed to start acting and not just reading.

* Based on the Alpha Game mentality, I changed the way we interact.  Instead of the ""how may I serve you princess?"" attitude I used to have, it's now more of a ""we're doing this (but she can veto it)"" attitude.  I still can't believe how much she likes this change.  She is a very powerful, successful woman, but at home she prefers to be told what to do.  When I first read about this in all the Alpha blogs, I thought it couldn't possibly apply to my wife, but they were right.  Every time I make a decision, regardless how unimportant it is, I catch her smiling at it.

* I don't shy away from sex talk any more.  We used to have a bunch of ""code words"" to avoid saying anything raunchy.  Now, I just confidently say ""I'm going to go masturbate"" or ""nice tits"", etc.  Again, I never would have thought she would like this but she smiles and playfully laughs.

* We get along again.  We're loving and cuddly, we do things together.  We go out together.  We look and act like a couple.

--

Regarding sex itself:

* A while ago, we talked about it and basically every time we'd EVER had sex (except for a handful of times that stood out), she has only done it because it had been a month or two and she felt like she had to.  She was never into it, she clearly didn't like it, it was dry and painful (for both of us), and pretty much terrible.  After talking we agreed to have no more terrible sex.  I'd rather not have any sex than have dry, quick, painful sex, that she wasn't getting anything out of, and she obviously agreed.  We were both concerned it would never happen again because she strongly associates it with pain and worries about it hurting.

* Last week, we had sex for the first time in 6 months.  It wasn't particularly planned or anything, but she said we should make out and it just escalated until she grabbed my dick and put it in.  She was wet and it went in the easiest it ever had without lube.  When we were done, she let me cum inside her which I hadn't done in YEARS.  It wasn't the best sex for either of us, but we've gotten the ball rolling again, she actually wanted it, and it didn't hurt her.


Now, I'm not stupid (at least, not any more), and obviously everything isn't all better.  But I feel like we have gotten over the most serious barrier to us getting back to normal (or, getting to normal for the first time).  She was ovulating at the time (I started tracking her cycle), so this is probably a once-a-month move from her, but I still feel progress is being made, and I'm no longer tracking the number of months since the last time I've had sex.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_q8529,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/q8529/just_had_sex_for_the_first_time_in_6_months_and/,

",26,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/n1kdr/foreplay_is_snoreplay_and_other_sad_sex_tales/,"First of all, I just want to say how happy I am that I've found a community that has as many sexual frustrations as I do. 
Especially the fact that I'm a woman, and I've found a lot of women on here that have had sex sad faces like me for a while. 

I think because most women view men as ""Always horny, always have the bedroom tango on their mind"" kind of creatures. I don't see men that way, but it's frustrating listening to my girlfriends gripe about how much their men want sex. Ahem...excuse me. I **want** that. It's hard explaining that my sex life is almost void, because there is the constant stereotype that only men get rejected. 

I've been with my guy for about a year and a half. We've been living together for almost a year. We click on every aspect, except for sex. He makes me unbelievably happy and I really do see myself spending the rest of my life with him. 

I would say we have sex maybe twice a month, and I'm almost always the one to initiate it. Always. So that twice a month romp is when he actually gives in. It's starting to feel like a pity fuck. When he turns me down, he has constant rebuttals like, ""I'm tired"", or ""It's too late"", or ""I know I won't cum"". It's harder and harder to accept those reasons for not having sex, and just seeing them as excuses so he doesn't have to be physical with me. He's very affectionate with me otherwise, but only to a certain extinct. He never kisses me for more than a few seconds, doesn't like tongue at *all*, and doesn't enjoy foreplay. 

Ah, the subject of foreplay. Foreplay is a non-existent word in my world. It's as foreign and make believe as Sasquatch or Rick Perry being able to count to three. I'm all about foreplay, for me I can't orgasm without it. He, on the other hand, can't stand it. He tells me it's boring, that he'd rather get right to sex. I've talked to him about it before, explained to him that I need it to feel intimate and to enjoy sex more. He simply either replies ""Foreplay is snoreplay"" in a joking manner, or he just squeezes my tits a little and kisses me a little more for a few minutes then goes right into it. 

He does have depression, and is seeing a counselor right now. And I've taken that into account, the fact that he's not happy a lot and probably needs medication. But, it seems that he's a selfish lover. We live together, I should be waking him up with bjs, sneaking into the shower when he's there and letting him fuck me like a sex goddess, staying in all day during the weekends and simply enjoy each others bodies. 

I offer blow jobs, (I love bjs, it turns me on giving them) but he also has a weird aversion to spit. He doesn't mind a bj now and again, but doesn't like me to lick or tease any other part of his body. Therefore, he doesn't do it to me. 

He doesn't go down on me either. Actually, he has **never** gone down on me. He says he's not good at it, I reply that I can show him what I like and we can work on it together. He uses an excuse that he has a short tongue, I reply that he doesn't have to use his tongue a lot. He can use his fingers and it would still feel better than nothing. Still....nothing.  

I miss being touched like someone has passion for me. I miss someone ravishing me, someone wanting to feel my body against them instead of just giving me a pity fuck once and a while. I've started to ask if he wants to have sex, and expecting him to say no. I've actually started to tell myself that I don't need sex anymore, just so I can be happier and push the fact that I don't have any intimacy in my life out of my mind.

I've (27m) been in a relationship w my SO (29f) for 3 years, and due to a variety of reasons over the past year, our sex life has slowly dwindled to about once a month. 

My SO went to the beach w some girlfriends for 5 days and came back last night. I went to watch a soccer game with some mutual friends of ours (go RailHawks!). I got there at half-time, and enjoyed the game. Game over, and everyone is standing around, waiting for fireworks. I have no interest in fireworks (it's still June, too early for 4th festivities) so I say my goodbyes. One of my friend remarks how he was surprised I made it there at all, given that my SO is back in town. He intimated how he thought we would be going at it like rabbits. I smiled coyly, and headed towards the parking lot. I was in no hurry to get back to my house, as there was nobody waiting to ravage me (as I would like to do to her). I just wanted to beat the traffic. 

I try to ignore the sadness that comes with our lack of sex, and focus on positives, and improving myself. But sometimes, in this instance my friend's innocent remark, i can't help but dwell on how much I miss sex w her. The amount of time I spend fantasizing about her makes me feel crazy. 

In her defense, she acknowledges this, and says that she misses her libido. She has gone to a therapist a couple times, but I don't see that it has helped. She tells me that I am sexy, and that she finds me attractive. The words help, but they don't carry the same weight as actions (or lack thereof). She is a loving and caring woman, and I love her. 

I don't know what the point of this is. I'm just frustrated w her, w our lack of sex, w myself, everything. I catch myself fantasizing on going down on her, or her sitting on my face (my fav).. Only to have to scold myself to stop. I don't know what the positive action is. Thanks for reading. Sorry for any typos - on my phone.

So we're completely broken up, I (28m) got my own place, and I'm much happier.  I'm feeling way more confident and have been getting positive feedback from women (and men incidentally, not interested but thanks!).  

It was quite serendipitous that I thought of my old HS crush shortly after the break up, found her on facebook, she has 2 kids but is newly single and jumped at the opportunity to meet up.  We had a date, a few drinks, made out hot and heavy but she had to get home so nothing else happened. THE GOOD NEWS GUYS-  OMFG a woman wanted me. Holy shit she wanted me.  I hadn't felt desired in years. She was ripping my face off and it was awesome.  It was the perfect reminder of how things should be.  She's texted me that she thinks I'm sexy etc.  A WOMAN. ACTUALLY. FLIRTS WITH ME. AND IS HOT. AND WANTS ME. 

Now the makeoutgirl and I have been texting and I set it up so that we could get together again and do tha thang.  That's really freaking me out though.  I haven't had sex in 2.5 years and am worried about a million and one things.  I'll list them so you realize how stupid they are.  I recognize all of this will feel natural once it starts, just like making out did after not making out for over a year. 

I forgot what sex feels like with a condom.  I have no idea where you cum if you're just bootycalling.  Do you go down on a booty call?  What if I only last 2 minutes? Do you spend the night or still be casual and be like ""call ya later"".  What if she gets attached?  What if I get attached?  

None of this will matter once I've had a couple of drinks and a good conversation and feel relaxed.  These are all my worries because I simply feel like a 28 year old virgin. 

But the good news again guys.... I ended my deadbedroom, I feel alive, and women actually want me. Who knew?   ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1hday3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hday3/my_story_update_3_positive_news_plus_need_advice/,

It's been 4 years for me with absolutely no sex. I'm the HL/25, he's LL/29. I've tried many different approaches but it never helps. Like other ""men"" I've read about here, he'll accept blowjobs but the moment I want to have sex, he has no interest. I think our physical fitness is a factor, but shouldn't be that huge of an issue. My bmi is 27(overweight) while he is a little past obese(he won't tell me his exact weight, funny). We used to be thinner but things change. I'm a much more active person, but as far as actually working out, my motivation is lacking.

The catch is that we have a child together, 3yrs. It wasn't planned obviously, but we are a somewhat functioning family. I hate his family completely, which puts a strain on our relationship; I have no family. He's a total momma's boy, and she and I don't get along at all, so you can see how that goes.

He's the laziest guy in the world. Blames me for nearly everything. He expects me to work, go to school, make the meals, clean the house, etc; he'll clean sometimes, maybe 30m once a week. Meanwhile, he has no job and is trying very little to get one. He watches our little one but that doesn't take up an entire day - I know, I've been in those shoes. I'm okay with being the breadwinner if he would just put more effort into us and actually fuck me once in a while(is every other night asking too much?).

Is he depressed? I don't know. He doesn't have many friends. I don't either, but I'm a loner like that; being alone doesn't seem to fit his nature like it does mine. 

I don't really *want* him anymore. I'm not a great lover, but I'm also very inexperienced compared to him(2 men vs. his at least 6-7 women). If we would practice more together, I'm sure we'd form more synergy in the bedroom. But it absolutely can't happen without both parties being interested. I, of course, feel ugly, unwanted, dirty, low, worthless, etc because of his lack of interest in me.

Needless to say, we have plenty of problems: the list is endless and a relationship like this is hard to get out of. But I'm just here to yak about my lack of D and cry to you guys.

This is an update to http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1dml9q/have_any_of_you_beaten_db_when_you_or_your_so_did/

I know it's only been a few days of PMO avoidance but as of yesterday something is waking up down there - and it's very hungry!!

Today and yesterday my GF and I have been entertaining my sudeen horniness - which came upon me without any warning at all while I was working yesterday morning and lasted until she came home from work. I was blue balled pretty much all day today too. Oral and hands suddenly feel like nothing I've ever experienced before - it's like a whole new world of sensation has opened up for me and I'm able to orgasm during foreplay and twice or three times again during sex - this has happened before but it came so naturally this time and wasn't any effort - I just wanted more and more!! Maybe this is because I was so pent up but it happened both times. I didn't fight them and they were within a minute, maybe two of each other. We figure I just need to surrender to it for now - relinquish control for now and just revel in the feelings.

I'd had a really shit day at work today and for the first time EVER, sex actually relaxed me and I perked right up - this is seriously new to me. I felt like I was on something for an hour or two afterwards - just totally floaty and happy.

She's even *looking* different, more beautiful, more desireable. Every part of her excites me.

I could go on, but needless to say I think my mojo is on it's way back in!!!

For all of you who you or your SO's have lost interest because of PMO - seriously get them to try this. I can't begin to describe how much more powerful the sensations are and how close I feel to my GF right now. I feel so manly and vigourous during and after. I can't fully describe it.

I'm never going back to PMO, ever.

I don't know what I want to do with my life.  There are so many things to work out.  I will have to move out, I will probably have to get a better job, and I will have to buy a new car.

How can you come back from the pain of having to plead with your lover for sex. How can you ever trust them again when you know they lie to you when you ask them why they don't want sex.  

I would have always felt less than or ashamed that I wasn't ""good enough"" to keep my lover wanting me.

I can't play these kind of mind games.  Will I ever find anyone again?  I don't know, maybe not.  There are spinsters out there, maybe I wasn't meant to be with anyone.

We used to have a decent sex life, then the relationship became very sexually charged for a brief period but was soon followed by maybe once a month.  Also, it is obvious when we are together that she is not 100% there mentally and doing it more for me.

I love her and want to work through this, but the way this has been making me feel lately is awful.  It is emasculating and embarrassing to be constantly rejected either directly or with excuses long before I can even try.  It kills me to be kissing her body and she is just not getting into it, looking at me with those eyes that scream she wants out of this situation and making me feel like so undesired by her no matter what I do.

She is aware there is a problem with her sex drive, and she has had a lot of changes in her life  lately (a much busier schedule) that has shaken her system up.  Even though I understand how these things can make desire for frequent sex die down, for her it has almost been completely killed.  If there is potential for a permanent problem here, I want to start working on it now while it is still early.  

Also, I don't think she is aware of just how much she hurts me and makes me feel undesired.  I don't know how to communicate this too her though without adding to the pressure she probably already feels? Also, once I tell her, then I'm in the trap of knowing that she is doing it just to shut me up and that makes me feel even worse...  I'd rather have no sex than pity sex. 

Maybe I'm more ranting than asking questions.. I could go on for pages though if I was actually allowing myself to rant about how she is making me feel.. I could realy use some advice though.

**UPDATE: As some of you may have seen, many were suspecting there was something more going on with her.. possibly an affair.  See the various conversations below and what I found:**

**UPDATE 2:** Well i wasn't able to observe as long as I liked to.  At one point she responded to a playful text advance with a hostile response and I became obviously upset with her.  When I cam home, she asked if I was angry with her... I told her I was and went into why; explaining the emotional distance, questionable behavior around this guy, etc...  I obviously wasn't able to tell her all I know and she did at times seem to be playing stupid, but I made her see my position and told her that ""I wasn't mad at her about the low libido, but I was mad about the fact that she seems to be doing nothing about it."" I also told her that this BS with the other guy needs to stop and I was at fault for not stepping in, but that point is done.

Am I happy with all the answers I received.. no.  Am I completely at ease.. not completely but a bit.  I am at ease enough to stop worrying about it but not so much where I'm not keeping a close eye on the situation. I wasn't able to tell her about the deleting messages and hiding conversations unfortunately. I asked her if she would feel more comfortable with her telling the guy he needs to back of or me doing it and she feels it would be better coming from her.  By the way, this was all Friday night.

Saturday morning, he did call her and ask if she was busy and she did tell him something along the lines of being busy all weekend and they needed to have a talk some time soon.  At some point the coversation seemed to get suspiciously quiet for a minute or two, but then again, I am overly cautious now and prone to look into things deeper than usual.

Still no sex as of this morning, but she has been much more intimate in general.  I can't say if things will change for the better or not yet at this point but I do feel a bit better about the situation for the time being.

It's him getting off, because he miraculously has an erection (nothing whatsoever to do with me), and he seems to think sex is slightly better than masturbation.  There is no intimacy whatsoever.  And sometimes I just want to get laid, but most times, what hurts the most is the lack of intimacy.  I'd rather not have those instances of ""sex"" we do have, because they don't make me feel any better afterwards.  No less empty.  Worse, usually.

I feel like there's never a good time to have a(nother) ""the talk"".  He's both in school full time and working full time.  I help him with his school work almost nightly and try to be as accommodating as possible to his schedule.  I feel like bringing up how crappy I feel ends up sending him into feeling like crap about himself and he struggles to get anything done/focus after the conversation.  

**So yesterday, he actually brought up the need to talk** because he could see/hear me over the last few weeks just sinking further into sadness.  He said he wanted to talk as soon as possible and wished he could leave work early so he could come home right then.  **That's the first time he's ever been eager to talk and listen.**

Fastforward to the conversation.  I told him that I didn't even know what to talk about and that I just felt awful.  I told him that even though we've only been married 10 months, not a month has gone by without me thinking of divorce.

**We have some friends where the wife in the relationship is extremely demanding.**  They live well above their means.  They set a budget for a house they could afford, she went 200$ a month above that and ""forced"" her husbands hand to get the house.  She demanded a new car and got a brand new 2013 with heated leather seats.  She booked hotels and moans and cries and yells if he wont take her on vacations once every couple of months.  She blows their money shopping all the time, decides what movies they go see, and gets screaming (literally, we've been witness to it) mad if he doesn't do what she asks.  They're also in a DB situation, but where he's the HL and she's the LL.  

**I'm not like that.**  I cook dinner every night, I make sure I stay well within our budget and put every extra penny I run into in our savings account.  I searched endlessly to find a nice house within our means.  The only vacations we've taken were free.  I don't care about going to movies or getting lots of expensive gifts.  

I ask for things like loading a pile of blankets into the back of the truck and laying out looking at the stars.  I ask for taking the dog to the park and playing catch with a football.  I ask for touching, flirting, being playful. I ask to be desired and for sex.  

It's not fair to see someone else be degrading and mean and unkind to their spouse and get everything they want while I'm the one who is uplifting and sweet and genuine and I can't even get a kiss that's more than a peck on the lips.

He broke down, as usual.  **He agreed with me** and said that I'm right, that I really don't ask for much and that he doesn't understand why his go-to answer is no.  He said he doesn't know why refuses all the little stuff, like taking a walk on the beach for five minutes or watching an episode of How It's Made with me and talking about the cool stuff we see.  He was upset with himself and feels awful about it all.  He promised to make efforts to do something different.  I talked about how hurt I feel and how I just don't know how to trust when he says that things will change.  **He was upset and feels like he's been incredibly selfish and said he wants to stop being that way.**  We'll end up bringing some of this up in counseling next week.

I talked about how sex has been unfulfilling and he agreed that it hasn't been good for him either the last time or two we've done it (once this year, before that was in mid december).

The talk just kind of dwindled out and we went to dinner.  **We came home and ended up having awesome sex that he initiated** and I orgasmed twice, and he even kept playing with me after he got off and got me off again until I had to yell for him to stop.  

**He left me a note this morning apologizing** again and saying that he wanted today to be the start of a serious turn in our relationship and how much he loves me.

**I want to believe it will be different, but I've been conditioned so much that I don't know how to trust all of this.**  Our ""the talk""s number the stars and every time he promises it'll be different... it just stays the same.

I want to be accepting if he really is making efforts and changing the way things have been, but I just don't know how to stop all the hurt, especially when it hasn't even been 24 hours.  I know that if I do believe it, I'm opening myself up to the just as likely possibility of more of the same.  But I feel the the possible ""reward"" is worth that?

**I'm going to try to think of this as a Day 1 in efforts to make a change and see how it goes from here.**  Sigh.

I have been deeply in love and married to my SO for 12 years. Typical DB stuff with a few emotional/physical issue's but nothing out of the ordinary for most of us here.
I started reading here a few months back and I saw my own behavior towards my LL SO pop up now and then and realized that I needed to stop doing certain things. In short, I got educated by those who know more than me and have shared here.
Well, about a week back, I started those changes which involved me not being Super Husband/Super Dad, I learned I was being Mr. Thoughtful for the wrong reasons. Here I will share the email I sent the wife when she finally asked ""whats up?""...
(no throwaway here, I am fucking human, deal with it, I do though I did edit a bit of personal info out)

&gt;Well Honey...
&gt;I have been reading http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms often and you and I are a classic study. We are so normal in this!
&gt;I am HL, you are LL. I do everything I can think of to show you I love you because I think that will lead to attention/affection/sex with you but it doesn't. It just leaves me bitter until I get over it and start doing it all over again, thinking this time for sure! All of these little things, special lunches, love notes on your windows, candles on your nightstand, thick socks, trying to dress you up, shining your shoes, even seeing Hookah Stew (learn some new songs guys...), I could go on, chocolates, even mowing the yard the other day and cleaning the driveway, I think...""Hey, she will notice this and reward me with affection!"", but heck no, you didn't even notice or if you did, you didn't say anything. I just need to do what I like to do but for the right reasons.

Which she replied...

&gt;
&gt;Secondly, I want to thank-you for the link to Reddit's dead bedroom
&gt;sub. I have been reading it and ""lurking"" for the past several days
&gt;and it has really helped me to understand what my ""LL"" is doing to you

&gt;slap in the face. (Being on the outside looking in has been
&gt;eye-opening). I will continue to learn and I promise you I will try to be more understanding, not just of you but myself.
Love you.

Well, edited heavily trying to get the gist of it but I just wanted to share that, we as a community really do affect change.

When we first got together the sex was often and amazing, and he was everything I was looking for in a relationship. I had been in a 3 year long relationship previously with a verbally abusive and selfish douche nozzle who refused to have sex with me because the house wasn't up to par with his OCD standards. So, when I met this sweet caring and generous man I thought I hit the jackpot. 

Things were going well and 6 months into the relationship he got orders to deploy. While he was deployed he gained weight. So much so he was put on notice by his overseas commander. He says he was so busy with work that he didn't have the time to work out. His deployment comes to an end, and he comes home. 

He soon starts drinking a lot. He's having several beers a night, and when he gets drunk he becomes obnoxious. I hate him when he's drunk, but he's been deployed, and he just needs time to relax. The drinking continues. Along comes a mock PT test and he fails. He's then put on notice by command, and is made to start doing monitored workouts. Meanwhile he's not cutting out the beer, and cutting back on food portion size. Every time I try to mention the beer he gets defensive and says he feels like everyone is picking on him. I drop it. His actual PT test comes around and HE FUCKING SLEEPS IN, and is late for the test. He's now on the commanders shit list.

He also procrastinates on everything. I have to constantly remind him to do things to the point I feel like a nag. Then when he does do something he half asses it, or just doesn't finish the job. When I try to bring this up he makes excuses of how he doesn't have any time, but when he does have free time he's playing EVE for hours on end. In the end I'm the only one cleaning the house, making dinner, and running errands. 

He is however a really sweet man. He compliments me and tells me I'm loved. He's book smart, which is awesome because we can have intelligent conversations, but sometimes doesn't seem to have common sense. He's horribly generous, and has been there to support me when I needed it most. My friends and family love him.

My problem is every time I look around the house I see something he's half assed, or neglected. So when he touches me I just want to scream ""get your shit together!""

--

I have been with my fiance for nearly 8 years now. We're finally getting married this September. I am very happy about this, however, I feel there is a problem in my relationship and neither me nor my fiance seem to know what to do about it. I would gladly love some advice.

My fiance, let's call him Joe for the sake of not wanting to type 'fiance' so much, has the usual mid-20s sex drive. He'd probably have sex every night if he could, but, I have the sex drive of a mute, peeling wallpaper. I rarely ever want to have sex. It's not that sex doesn't interest me, it just doesn't interest me as much as him. I can't say that I feel it is personally important in a relationship, and that's conflicting since I know that is *is* rather important in typical relationships. But, I can't force myself into it, you know? I look at him and hear my inner thoughts telling me how much I love Joe and how much he's going to love his birthday cake and how much fun we're going to have playing video games and doing stuff together and watching silly shows--I really love him. I love waking up next to him in the middle of the night when I have a bad dream and nudging him awake to hold me and protect me. Joe's such a great guy. He'll make an even better husband.

So, why can't I bring myself to give him what he really wants? Society has made me think there's something wrong with me if I don't want to have sex about 3 times a week. At this point, I probably have sex on average of once every 2 or 3 months. (I know some of you must have just slammed your head into your keyboards and thanked some unknown cosmic force that you're not him...) But, you see, there is the problem. Yes, I do find him sexy/attractive. Yes, I want to marry him. Yes, I want a family with him. But, I'm worried that my lack of sexual vigor will drive him away, or worse, make him unhappy. I don't want Joe to ever be unhappy.

We've tried talking about it and the only consistent variable of this discussion seems to be my lack of interest. More commonly so I find myself saying, ""I just don't want to."" I don't want to be romanced, or touched, or cuddled, or penetrated in any orifice. I don't want candle lit dinners and romantic music with rose petals and bubble baths. I've done those things and they don't make me want to have sex--they just make me sleepy. And it's hard for me to spontaneously get into the mood to begin with, but since arguments over my lacking desires and reading online that sex on a weekly basis is normal and healthy, I feel pressured and it makes it even harder because now he doesn't just want it, Joe fucking *expects* it. And why shouldn't he? He works hard and loves and takes care of me. The least I could do is give in every now and then, right? And I do, but when I do, it's never on my terms and that's such an unfair thing to say since 'my terms' would safely be once a year if I could get it my way.

I feel so inadequate. I feel ugly and stupid that I don't experience sexual urges regularly. And I really *want* to. I feel it's a real possibility that this problem will come up again and again in the future and may destroy our relationship. And I know he's unhappy about it as it is. I've tried every sensual thing I could think of and find and I just can't bring myself to want it when he does. I feel that I'm being very selfish and unfair to Joe. So, DeadBedrooms, do you have any advice for this predicament? I want Joe to be happy that he decided to marry me and not regret it down the road. And really, I wish it was as easy as ""just effing do it, you cunt"", but it's not.

Thank you in advance for your time and patience with this problem. It means most.

**TL;DR: My fiance has a usual sex drive and I just don't. I want to give him what he wants but I can't force myself to be in the mood when I'm just not. Advice?**

EDIT: Oh, I don't know if this is very relevant, but I just thought of it. We're both in our early 20s, have lived together for over 2 years, I am a woman, and I am very content not having sex. Though I am not oblivious to sexual appeal, I can not say that I look at other men/women and think ""yeah, I'd let him/her do me"" in any regular way.

1329666359.0,26,self.DeadBedrooms,pwhl8,Wife lacks common sense when it comes to sex - continuing DB situation,27,1,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/pwhl8/wife_lacks_common_sense_when_it_comes_to_sex/,"I've posted on the subreddit before.    This is a specific rant I need to have, I'm curious how others handle this.   My wife and I are both 33 years old, been married nearly 10 years.  She had more sexual experience before we got together than I did, so if anything she's got about 6 years of having sex on me.  Yet, I feel like the more sexually experience one at this point.  Primarily, because I have the ability to think logically about sex.

So, we have fairly bad sex about once every month or so.    We've been on the brink of divorce for a while.   But we're giving it a shot until our 10th anniversary in september.   I don't initiate sex at all because we've found it to be unproductive.  She's only in the mood to have sex very rarely, and when I initiate without her being interested in the first place, it goes horribly wrong.    She's somewhat willing to go through the motions, but it is beyond obvious she'd rather be having a root canal than be there.    She thinks I'm some kind of mind-reader that can tell this and she apologizes for not ""acting better"" even though what I've stressed is I don't want her to fake wanting to have sex with me.   So, we both agreed she would let me know the rare times she's in the mood.

Here's what happened last week.   I feel asleep first and she came to bed a few hours later.   To my surprise, she wakes me up and starts initiating some kind of sexual activity.   Mostly just touching me, and it was obvious she was turned on.   I play into her hand, start kissing her, and initiating right back.   Things are going well, and all of a sudden, she's no longer into it.   I was going down on her at the time.   This happens a lot.   I ask her if anything is wrong, and she tells me everything is fine and to keep going.   She ""doesn't mind"" me going down on her (I love it) for a few minutes so I keep it brief and move on.

But it is well beyond obvious she doesn't want to keep going.   She's stressed to me that she would tell me if it isn't working for her so I keep going.  We eventually more on to intercourse but I know this isn't doing anything for her.   Which kills it for me.  I don't lose my erection or anything, but to be honest, I would rather masturbate than have sex with someone is just giving me pity sex.

So, she asks me what's wrong - do I want another position, and I just tell her ""the position isn't the problem"".  Before I can explain she pushes me away and starts crying.    Eventually I get her to admit she wasn't into it and my assessment is correct.   She hates that I know her so well.   I don't know how to explain to her that any onlooker could tell that she wasn't into it.  She's that obvious.    But it isn't that I want her to fake it.   If she isn't into having sex with me we should stop.

Of course we had a long drawn out conversation about this, but she admitted there was nothing I could have done differently.   I asked her what was wrong, and in the past when I've stopped all activity when I noticed, she got equally as mad.  Both options would have ended with her crying.

So, I asked her what she could have done differently as it seems like her losing interest is a common problem.  Of course she has no idea.   Meanwhile I know certain things turn her on, even if she doesn't.  For instance, taking the focus away from her sexual pleasure tends to turn her on.  I've suggested she shift the focus to me - like give me a blowjob instead if she's getting to that point.   If I was losing my erection, I would shift the focus back to her until I was turned on again.  And if I had found that it wasn't coming back, I would just make sure she was taken care of and not worry about myself.   If she were to do the same for me, there's a chance she could get turned back on and eventually move to intercourse.  If not, I could have an orgasm and we could call it a night.   She agreed this make sense and could do that in the future when feeling this way.   For me, this seems like common sense.   For her, the thought had never even crossed her mind.   Although we have talked about it before, she just forgot.   

That's basically the first common sense issue.

She was having some body image issues we had talked about in the longer conversation, but she was having trouble falling asleep (much like me) so I knew helping her have an orgasm would help her fall asleep.   I got a sheet, put it over her, got her magic wand out and helped her very quickly have an orgasm.  She was happy and feel asleep quickly.  It was about 2:30am and I had to work in the morning, but I knew she was upset and this would help her along.

Of course, I still have this ridiculous erection, but she made no offer to help.   I tossed and turned for another hour before masturbating and crying myself to sleep.  Then had to get up for work 3 hours later.    I just don't understand her selfishness.  She barely even needs or wants sex, but I am willing to help her whenever she wants it.   And forgoing an orgasm every once in a while is fine, but this is typical behavior for her.   It's just the right thing to do to at least reciprocate to your partner.    This to me is also common sense.

She knows our marriage is on the line.   We have a 2 year old which is basically what's holding us together now.  And she wants another child, but I've made it more than obvious that we aren't even going to attempt another child until we get this issue worked out.  (the first was not planned and was failed birth control)

I realize that it's most likely that we will eventually get divorced, I just needed to rant to those that would understand.

It was great to see other people who were working through problems similar to mine, get advice and learn different approaches.  One of the things I saw was the recommendation of the book 'The Sex Starved Marriage.'  After picking it up myself, I introduced it to my wife and asked her to read it with me.  I was amazed when she agreed (massive first step- felt hugely optimistic).  

She's been through most of the book and there's been some positive response.  We've had sex more in the last 6 weeks than we have in any six week period for years.  However, it's always 'quickie' sex.  And usually prefaced with 'Will this be fast?', which has always been one of the largest turn-offs I've ever experienced.  So I decided to talk to her about it.  

Over the course of a week of short, somewhat sporadic discussions (I didn't want to just pound on it for two hours straight, so I split it up into more casual chats) she basically told me that she gets no enjoyment from physical intimacy and would be fine if it just disappeared from our relationship.   It came out as I was trying to explain to her that I love a good quickie now and then, but that a sex life of all quickies seems so. . . transactional.  There's no real intimacy, there's no real depth to it.  Her response was that it didn't matter as the end is all the same.  Get in, get off and move on- who cares how it's done?  'Foreplay is too much work and too much time.' is one of the things she said.  

So I tried explaining to her that my idea of a healthy sex life is much more robust- it's exploratory, it grows and evolves and gives us new memories and different avenues to explore together.  I'm not particularly experimental or needing anything exotic.  But the same two positions, prefaced with 'Which way do you want me?' is just *not good.*

Anyway, as we discuss it over the past week, she basically says that all sex is kind of obligatory on her part.  She doesn't particularly enjoy it, even though she orgasms, and she just doesn't care about it.  I find that devastating.  I just don't know how I feel about a lifetime of knowing that the person I'm having sex with is only doing it out of obligation and doesn't care about what's happening between us. I'm really having a hard time digesting it, and I'm hoping that someone here has been on either side of that scenario and can tell me how it works and how it still feels rich, and caring and worthwhile for you.

When I think back, the first 5 months we had a ""normal"" sexual relationship.  Normal to me means several times per week and trying new things, like having sex outside the house.  Around 5 months, the frequency suddenly dropped.  I didn't say anything, but after awhile I put more effort into trying to initiate.  He has given me every excuse in the book: ""I'm too tired"", ""it's too hot"", ""the neighbors might hear"", and so on.  If I try to touch him, he will actually slap my hand away and move into a position which makes it impossible for me to touch him.  He gets so defensive that it feels like I'm molesting him so I've stopped trying to touch him lately.

I've tried things like a romantic bath to get him in the mood.  I'll scrub down the bathroom, put some music on, light candles, give him a massage.  I'll try to kiss him passionately in the shower and suggest that we go to the bed, but he pushes me away and immediately after the bath he will suddenly be *so busy* and there's suddenly just *so much work to be done*.  It's hurtful when someone pretends to be busy to avoid you.

I decided to post here because this problem is consuming my thoughts. I've cried too many times over this.  It's starting to hit me hard that we've had a DB for almost 4 years now.  In the past 2 years we had sex just 8 times.  We haven't had sex since December '12.  That's almost 8 months without sex or any kind of sexual contact.

I've always thought that sex is just something couples do.  That is happens naturally.  I've talked to him about this a few times but I'm always left with more questions than answers.  He's given me two big hints: that he want ""intellectual stimulation"" and ""mental seduction"".  I asked him what he meant by this but he wouldn't answer.  He did say that sex is not about physical seduction for him.

So what can I do to intellectually stimulate him?  Sometimes I wonder if this is the actual issue or if it's another excuse.  I feel hopeless because if I haven't figured it out after 4 years, will I ever be able to?

While this wasn't predicated solely on our DB, it had a huge role to play.  For the past week, it seems that we were both in some strange zombie-mode where we were living solely as roommates. Oddly enough, last Sunday we had sex for the first time in a month.  

She got up early that morning, and left for the gym. As she left, she kissed me goodbye, and whispered (somewhat naughtily) to stay in bed, that she would be back in bed soon. 

She came home round 10:30 am, and took a shower. This followed with her getting in to bed with her iPad to look for patio furniture. This followed up with catching up on work. By this time it was 12:45, and we both know that she has to be at work by 2.  We had rushed, unfulfilling sex. I was crushed. I felt that I fell below patio furniture on her list of priorities. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted sex, I wanted her, I wanted to be wanted. But not like that. It was tough to rationalize within my own brain.  

Ever since then, we continued to exist as a couple only in name. I felt miles away in bed with her, and felt like our lives were some routine that was predestined. So today, we ended things.  I’ve moved out, and I’m crashing at my sister’s house. I can’t help but feel like my life is in a tailspin, but at the same time I have a strange positive outlook for my life.  I’ve been recently laid off, and now am without my best friend. 

I now have opportunities to find a job that I love, and to find a fulfilling relationship.  The dead bedroom wasn’t the only fault in our relationship. I have my many issues, as does she.  I don’t know if I became fixated on our sex life which negatively affected the rest of our relationship, but I feel like I didn’t let other aspects of our life fall. I cleaned the house, went grocery shopping, tried to cook dinner, blahblahblah, but it didn’t help. 

The romance in our relationship had been dead for some time.  Tonight is the first night in 3 years that I consider myself single. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but I am looking forward to it.  I empathize completely with all of you, and will continue to lurk this subreddit. Thank you for reading my wall of text.

I guess you could say that I'm HL and he's LL. We've been having the same issues and the same talks since before January.

Anyway, I was hanging out at home yesterday, mostly naked because it was hot. He came home from school and randomly told me that I looked really good. I lost about 10 pounds a couple months ago and it had never really garnered a response before so I just took it as whatever.


Around bedtime, we're siting on the couch watching tv and he starts telling me about how good I looked earlier today and how he wanted to have sex but I was kind of busy (doing art commissions) and he had to do school work and had mentioned how he's been masturbating less so he's glad that it looks like his libido is coming back.

I just kind of nodded and smiled. I mean, it's great that he's working on fixing his problems. He's always tried to find way to fix things though and they usually get forgotten, so I wasn't going to get all excited about it.

So we head to bed and about 5 minutes later, I'm already half asleep but I wake up a little because he puts his arm around me and cuddles up against me. Then he starts telling me about how he likes my underwear and how soft they were.

I'm trying to go to sleep so I figure if I don't say anything he'll figure that I'm asleep but he just ends up scooting closer to me and I can feel his erection on my back.

Part of me was like, ""Fuck yes! I should jump on this opportunity!"" but the other part was kind of peeved so I just ignored it and fell asleep.


Today, I woke up still annoyed with a hint of angry. I'm angry because he very weakly attempted to initiate, and because I didn't respond. I mean, that could have been the only chance I got before having to wait a whole other month or more. At the same time, I don't want to be that person that just waits for sex to happen and jumps to the occasion. I feel like that may send a bad message.

Hint: Don't do it.,27,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hreeh/anyone_else_try_substituting_food_for_sex_hint/,"I went years and years in as the HL partner in a relationship with very little sex. The sex we did have was always initiated by me, and there was active resentment from my partner when we did have sex. I found pretty early on that I could partially sate my libido by eating until I couldn't even think about sex. 

Anyway, I ended up weighing 320 lbs. I have since started what is a very very long path toward losing weight. I have lost 15 lbs and it has been more difficult for me than getting a Ph.D. was. I wanted to post this for three reasons:

1. Don't wait to start working on the issues in your relationship. It is better to end it, no matter how much that frightens you or makes you feel like a failure (those are the reasons I stayed in it).

2. *Never* make bad feelings go away with a destructive habit. It didn't seem like a big deal to me to eat a bag of chips 150 lbs ago. As the weight started to crop up on me, I always thought ""I can stop anytime, and get back to normal."" Well it's taking a huge amount of effort. I'm not sure how drinking or cutting or other habits work, but in my experience undoing the damage to my body is going to take a lot of time and effort.

3. I just wanted to let you know things can get better. Despite the weight I had some mind-blowing sex with someone who *actually wanted to be with me*, and I feel better about myself which probably why I have managed to make the progress I have made so far.

I'm very HL, very far from vanilla. He's LL and apparently pretty vanilla. He has a shower/shaved fetish (or whatever the word we decided on during my first post), which worked out well when we were first dating because I'd only see him a few times a week, we'd be going out, and we'd both look our best before going out. Now we've been together for 5 years, we don't really ""go out"" anymore and we both shower in the morning before work/school, and I shave everything below the belt about every 1-2 weeks.

If I'm not FRESHLY showered and shaved, he's not interested. Nope, nothing, nada. We don't even snuggle or make out. We have sex once every 2-4 months, and typically I don't even have an orgasm with him because he doesn't even try anymore.

---------------------------

About a week ago, I attempted a discussion with him that rapidly evolved into an argument. We were laying in bed and it ended with him raising his voice more than I felt was necessary for what was supposed to be a civil discussion, I asked him to keep it down or we couldn't continue the conversation anymore and he yelled louder and said it wasn't fair that I always decide when the conversation ends. FFS I just want to talk like a civil adult human being...

He's since dropped the shaved thing, but told me the smell of humans makes him feel physically ill. He still says I don't shower often enough, but I'm not sure what he expects because I shower at least once a day when I have to work, go to school, and again after the gym. So, I mean, it's great to know the way I smell makes him physically ill. Am I the only person who loves the smell of a sweaty man, or the smell of pussy?

I just got out of the bubble bath about two hours ago and walked up naked behind him on the computer playing video games, started rubbing his shoulders, and asked what we were planning on doing tonight. He said something about fireworks, and I asked when he'd be off the computer so we could do ""something else"", and he said ""soon"". I lingered a little bit but it was clear that ""soon"" meant ""maybe later"", so I got dressed and went to watch tv. 

I'm not against showering if it means I'll get laid. And maybe I was in the wrong by not just asking ""wanna fuck?"" But damn, where's the spontaneity and the romance, the flirting and the playful foreplay.

Well, I had finally gotten tired of hiding my usage of porn from my LL wife. 

She didn't take it so well...

She immediately started screaming at me, telling me I'm disgusting, perverted, and sick. She said that's where my high libido comes from. Deeper into the argument, I asked her what she expected. Was she just expecting me to keep suffering in silence alone and not try to occupy myself? I mentioned counselling, but she thinks the religious counselor she saw that told her sex isn't a significant part of a relationship was good enough for her; that I'm the one that should be seeing someone. She then told me that she's talked to all of her married friends said they hate having sex with their husbands and that I should be happy with our once a month arrangement. She was acting as if I had nothing to complain about and that I'm being unreasonable by expecting her to be interested in me sexually. She said that I am lucky she's not withholding sex just to get favors like other women do. She said every woman thinks sex is disgusting except for whores and sluts. She said she has to force herself to have sex with me and also asked me how would I feel if she told me that every time we have sex she fantasizes about dicks much bigger than mine. I told her I bet she already does and she just smirked. It was at that point that I left the house to have a smoke and let things deescalate, I hate arguing in front of our daughter.

Now I'm sitting in my office watching E3 videos, trying my damndest to block out the hopelessness that this argument has brought in.

I just want someone to feel the same way towards me as I do them. I want to be wanted, to feel sexy, and most of all, I want something to look forward to.... I have no clue if there's any good outcome to all of this, but I am so incredibly happy to have a place where I can vent and let all of this out, rather than keep it in and let it eat away at me

It began with a basic conversation about happiness, with her being comfortable with the status quo. On the other hand, I was clear in my unhappiness and the need to change.


While we've had mild dustups with regards to the db of the last 7 years, this was the one that finally reached a point of breaking.  Essentially she told me that she wasn't willing to change, nor would she be willing to speak with a marriage counselor. Instead of accepting this and rolling along (which I've done in the past), I pushed the point and she kind of exploded.  


She blew up with a stream verbal abuse about my flaws, and decided that since I clearly did not want to be with her it was over. In the next couple of days she took a couple of opportunities to unload on me about what a terrible person I am, and how much I used her over the years.  


At this point, my path becomes pretty clear and I'm totally fine with it. Even though figuring out a situation with our kids/home/divorce will suck, this long term is not happening.  


Then she throws a curveball, and is seeing the Dr to check her hormone levels and might want to work on things (still no counseling). This was totally unexpected, but even her personality seems to have shifted due to my (apparently) newfound backbone.

I am literally willing to do anything in my power to increase your sexual appetite towards me. I just have zero fucking clue what I could possibly do at this point. If you are reading this and thinking, ""i just don't know"", then I feel like our last option is counseling. I am not going to be trapped in a relationship with a woman who doesn't desire me because it makes me feel like shit and I deserve better. 

I know you are tired from your job. I know you are stressed about the wedding. I know you aren't satisfied with your body. Things aren't going to be perfect. Your job will never be stress free. Your body is never going to be perfect in your eyes. Those are not valid excuses. 

Are you attracted to other people? Do you want to have an open relationship? I want to put everything out on the table and make sure that you are being completely, 100% honest with me about how you are feeling on the inside because when it comes to sex, I just do not know what is going on inside of you. At all. Whenever I think, ""oh that went well, maybe she will be a tiny bit more interested in fucking me,"" it always proves to be a completely false thought. A great night of sex will be followed by 2 weeks of abstinence and excuses. Are you depressed? Are you cheating on me? Am I terrible in bed? Do I need to do more in our relationship outside of the bedroom? Once again it is imperative that you are 100% honest with me for the sake of our relationship. 

I just don't see what has changed from when we first got together. You told me you were very open about sex, you thought about sex all the time, you would send me sexy emails... Where did that girl go? I am attracted to you more now than I was back then yet we have less sex than when we lived 100 miles apart. Was all of that act a lie? Did you not actually think about sex all the time? Did you not actually want to have sex with me all the time or write sexy emails? Was that all an act to get me to fall for you?

I know this email makes me sound like an asshole but I am just so angry and frustrated with our sex life that it has made me angry and frustrated in other parts of my life. (protip: if I am ever cranky, angry, frustrated, or sad, most likely it is/was because I am not getting enough sex).

we make fun of steve and mary's relationship all the time but as shitty as their relationship is, I bet mary gets more sex than me. We have to stop deluding ourselves and start to face the truth: we need a fix for our sex life. 

I have tried being aggressive, I have tried being passive, I have tried talking to you, I have tried having you go to the doctor, I tried buying you toys to make you more interested, I tried to make you cum every time we do anything sexual and I have gotten zero permanent results. 

I just cannot be happy in my life if I am not experiencing sexual intimacy with you on a more regular basis. So here is the deal, unless you have some sort of plan to fix this we are going to find a way to pay for couples counseling.

HL 30F, my story.",29,7,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/17xeuk/db_because_i_killed_it_hl_30f_my_story/,"Been with my spouse for ~8.5 years total, 3 of that married. I was young and unwise when we got started; I felt like it would be okay to give up a lot of my sexual wants/needs because I really loved him.

So on we went... for 8 years... me never completely satisfied with our very vanilla sex life. I am kinky, always have been, and he is not. He would participate if I really pushed him, but it's always obvious that he doesn't really enjoy it at all, regardless of how much it turns me on.

I could maybe live with vanilla if it was good vanilla. But he doesn't try anything to get me wet. He doesn't try anything to get me off. He doesn't know how. I made the mistake early on of letting those things go, which was a mistake, but there was a reason...

The problem is, if I try to teach or direct him in any way while we are having sex, he freaks out and loses his erection. This has majorly contributed to me just giving up and letting foreplay etc. go, because I told myself that lame sex was better than getting 1/3 of the way through it and stopping. And the psychological ED thing just felt like a crisis that I needed to fix, rather than stopping and thinking, *hmm, maybe we're not compatible.*

So I thought, okay, maybe it'd be better to let him read about something when we're not together and try it when he's ready. I bought him a book. I told him to look things up online. He did, and he did something that felt really good, like, twice, and then never did it again. I have no idea why - I definitely let him know it was good and encouraged him to keep at it. Just no motivation.

I've tried over and over again to talk to him about his approach, his attitude, how I want to be made to feel (ie desired, worthy), how much more important sex is to me than it is to him... and I have never been able to get through to him. No matter how much I explain that this is hurting me, that this is important to my *life* and my personal sense of well-being, he just isn't motivated to make changes.

Over time, I've become bitter about this, and I withdraw, making it even harder for him to approach me. 

He is so shy about sex that he can barely say the word. Like, if he's using it in a sentence, he says ""sex"" a little quieter, like it's a dirty word. I find this shyness repulsive. 

To make matters worse, I have come to the realization over the last half a year or so that I am very submissive and masochistic, on top of the other kinks I already knew about. That explains why I'm practically disgusted by his shy, shrinking, beta approach.

Last year, exasperated and lonely, I ended up cheating on him for a brief while with an extremely dominant, sadistic, amazingly skilled man. I felt like myself for the first time in so many years. I don't feel guilty at all.

That experience served to further highlight the massive chasm between myself and my spouse, sexually: I'm not just HL, I'm an *extremely* sexual person. And he's really, really *not.*

After that I realized I couldn't stand to be around him anymore for fear that he would try to have sex with me. I told him we had to stop for a while. Otherwise I'd be running away from him all the time.

So there it is... DB, because I killed it. It's only been 5 or 6 weeks, but since it happened so explicitly, it's something that is going to need to be addressed.

I asked for an open marriage at the end of 2012, but I'm honestly not sure exactly what that would accomplish. *Maybe* I'd at least feel like he was willing to do *something* to let me feel sexually fulfilled, but I don't know for sure. I'm just really at a loss for where to go from here, though, because I definitely cannot go back to the way it was before. 

Edit to add a little salient background info:  
* I am currently sans employment, a joint decision made by me and my spouse, making leaving him that much more complicated.  
* He is a traveling consultant; the kind that is gone for 50% of every week. This obviously complicates our problems with disconnection.  
* He is not American, and there may be some cultural issues at play with how he views women and marriage, though I don't think that is explanation for all of it.    
* I am currently in therapy for all my codependency issues etc, which is how I figured a lot of this out. He is not in any therapy.

I'm 41, married 15 years, and haven't had sex in 10. When my husband and I got together, we had good sex for the first 5 years. Then it...trailed off.  I would ask, what's wrong?! I'd get excuses...stress, etc.  I believed them, of course. 

Five years ago he left an email account open. It was an initial contact to an escort. I lost my shit and dragged him out of bed. He cried, I screamed, we screamed all night (me: you've wasted my life!) He claims he has a problem and has been seeing escorts. Started before we got together, and he was able to not do it for years at the beginning of our relationship/marriage. Then when our sex trailed off...he started up. Says he hates himself for it every time, serious self loathing.

I love him, he loves me. We still consider each other soulmates intellectually and emotionally. So we went to a counselor and he went to a 12 step sex addict group. There were 'worse' problems there- rapists, flashers, etc. (At least he and the escorts were somewhat consenting).

Another issue is that although he has always thought me out of his league looks-wise (and comments from friends and strangers confirmed this: ""how did you get her?!). I don't get that. But although he loves me, he thinks of sex as something dirty and disgusting that you wouldn't do with someone you love dearly. It has to be in a gross situation that you feel bad about later. 

Since we are and were still physically affectionate (we sleep snuggled up, we hold hands, hug, kiss), the therapist had us do massage on each other, building up to doing it naked. That didn't work, really. For me, desire happens BEFORE the clothes come off. You want to rip the clothes off because there is desire! 

Then we moved countries and with all that upheaval stopped doing it.

It took me a LOT to forgive him, although there is residual anger of course. At this point, it's been so long that I can't imagine me feeling better about it. Our life is good otherwise. 

I don't knwo what I'm asking, and don't have a question really...just was surprised to find this subreddit and wanted to get it off my chest.

In my opinion, this is just one more way to unattach myself from him.  I would like to get a divorce eventually, but I don't feel like I'm completely ready for that.  But, I feel that this is a step in the right direction.

He had already been sleeping in the other room once or twice a week due to arguments or me waking him up due to snoring issues.  I decided to make it permanent.

All his clothes are now in the other room.  He is going to be using a separate bathroom.  I hope this will lead to living slightly more separate lives.

I was just so tired of feeling alone in the bed with him.  I feel less alone sleeping by myself than sleeping next to someone who doesn't want to touch, talk, or be intimate with me.  I have told him before that we don't have a normal marital relationship.  For all the senual contact we have, he might as well be my dad or brother (i.e. We have zero physical contact whatsoever).

I think I'm going to feel so much happier in a bed and room by myself rather than constantly feeling like my expectations are being let down.  It was too frustrating!  It's time to try something new.  Plus, I want an oasis away from the disappointment.  I want my bedroom to be a haven away from an unhappy marriage.

I'm now going upstairs to rearrange the furniture, clean out my closets, and feel like I'm starting something new.

When we started dating a couple years ago she loved sex, had a craving for it, and in fact there was even a time she wanted it more than I did. (Unlike her I've always been consistent and want sex 4-8 times a week regardless of stress, etc.) 

Sex has been steadily dwindling for a year. Now she doesn't want sex more than once a week. For the past 6 months we've averaged maybe once every 2 weeks. This just seems crazy for people as young as we are. We've talked about this, fought about it for almost a year and there is no resolve. She hates giving blowjobs. She's given me a total of 3 in the time we've been together and for those I had to ask like some kind of creep. She says if I were 'better' to her, and 'understood what was important to her', then the sex would come naturally. This is bullshit, the reason I have retracted almost daily massages, cooking awesome meals for her and being an all around kick ass boyfriend is not only that my needs are no longer being met, but I just bought a house and I'm remodeling it the way SHE wants it. I asked her beforehand if she was game to this plan and she agreed and was excited about it. You think a person would appreciate that and maybe have some energy to be a little intimate once in a while? No, she comes home and watches TV while I work my ass off in and out of the work place. 

Now I know that I sound like an asshole writing this, and really I have to give her credit for being an extremely loyal and otherwise loving person. She is depressed and recently on medication, so there is that too, (not like I haven't been there) but it's like she can't even see how the DB is ending our relationship. She thinks we're getting married and she talks to me about the children we'll have! I once thought we were on course for this but I no longer think so. She knows this yet she makes no changes because now she feels like I'm forcing her with my expectations. Funny how when I talk about what I need and want, suddenly providing it is now ""forced"". It's a vicious cycle. I don't say anything, I get nothing. I say something, I get a reason for getting nothing.

By the way, I've talked about all of this with her. Verbatim. We've been to counseling (which I initiated and attended happily and with an open mind). Didn't work. I've tried to do more and that's an obvious mistake. I've asked her what she wants and she doesn't know. Real difficult to help somebody who is that clueless. In an attempt to cool myself off, being not the cheating type, I've taken to browsing gonewild and fantasizing about how great it would be to have a real sex life.

Anyway, eventually I'm going to tell her that she has to move out. I could use some advice on how to do this. She is very sensitive, often confused, depressed, and not very good at handling herself in stressful situations. How can I do this as a nice guy? I don't want to hurt her, I just want something better and more fitting for the both of us. She doesn't want to leave, I'm pretty sure. WTF should I do?

**TL;DR Relationship problems. GF doesn't want sex like she used to. Has been a trend for too long now. I'm going to leave her (kick her out of my house) as nicely as possible. I'm open to advice.**

I got some helpful replies from some really generous people.  I felt like with these resources me and my SO could start improving the situation.

Sadly, when I tried to talk about these things with her it ended with her saying that the conversations about sex cause her to not want sex for a very long time.  She explained to me that it makes her feel like sex is a chore, and she can't get turned on in any way when that is the case.

It's been a week since we had that conversation and I have been doing my best to be attentive to her needs and be emotionally connected with her.  A few days ago she told me that I was being really clingy.  This confused me because in prior conversations she told me that one of the reasons for her lack of sexual desire was because I wasn't spending enough time with her.

I would just like to have a conversation with everyone here.  I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but I guess it would just be nice to relate to other people with similar issues.  I spent the whole day with her yesterday and we had a really good time, we were laughing together and I was being sweet without being sexual, trying not to make her feel pressured.  When we went to bed I held her and was hoping things could go further, but she said ""good night"" and I was left there on the verge of tears, trying to hide it and avoid bringing it up again.  Obviously it would be fine if it was just that night, but it was as if I felt the weight of dealing with this for over a year, and it was only stronger because I knew I couldn't talk about it or she would only become distant and upset.

EDIT 1:  I just wanted to say that I don't have any desire to leave her right now.  We aren't married currently and we aren't engaged.  I realize it's possible that the relationship will not work, but it would seem like a damn shame.  We may feel like roommates at the moment but it seems worthwhile to at least try her suggestion.  Release some of the pressure she is feeling, stop talking about sex so much, let her breathe a bit, and see if something changes.

Since he recently admitted to watching porn and jacking off daily after he promised he would stop because of our lack of sex, I decided to quit being jealous and embrace it and talk somewhat about it (as we both have similar, but probably odd taboo fantasies) I would tell him I downloaded/watched a good porn earlier and left it open if he wanted to watch it later, I would make comments about how it is so hot thinking about him jacking off and watching other women (or transsexuals :P), pointing out sexy or cute girls, ordering some beads and a vibrator and talking about how I spent an hour using them while thinking of him using me as nothing but a little slutty hole. Anyway...you get the picture :P I'm embracing the fact that I'm super submissive and that he's dom and bringing out his desires so we can share them together. 

I'm still nervous sometimes, but I no longer feel like I'm being pity fucked. He asks me and he is taking control and I love it. We have more work to do as far as re learning how pleasure one another and make the other even happier, but it is getting better and better :D

I try to be supportive all the time. I'm the kind of guy that believes that sex is the strongest bond between two human beings who love each other (I'm hopelessly romantic). I lost a lot of weight, stop drinking soda and almost stopped smoking for her. I try to be with her all the time. I changed a lot.

What should I do know? I already tried the following techniques to ""ask"" for some kind of intimacy:

* not asking (not working obviously)
* asking (she freaked out but it was my fault, she's a rape victim after all)
* showing that I'd like to have more intimacy (she's not in the mood, sick, has her periods, ...)

The problem is that she loves me and show it to me all the time, and she's not ""asexual"" at all. Something is kind of broken in her (but I don't lose hope, I know time and love can repair things). I successfully applied a few things that I asked to /r/rapecounseling, that helped a bit.

1371763266.0,22,self.DeadBedrooms,1gr4zv,Trying to get out of the DB for my lovely boyfriend. I'm the problem.,29,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gr4zv/trying_to_get_out_of_the_db_for_my_lovely/,"Sooo - I just discovered this sub yesterday and I thought, I could/should as well share my story. I apologize in advance for any gramma/spelling mistakes - English is not my native language. 

My boyfriend (29) and me (31) have been together for more than 5 years. We love each other very much - without any doubt. But our sex life is non-existant - and mostly I'm the problem. There are several reasons for it. 
I used to have a HL, just as much as my boyfriend, but due to some medical / psychological issues it's completely gone.
 
1) Here's the 1st reason: I developed a skin problem (heavy acne - noone knows why) some years ago and my gynecologist therefore perscribed me a birth control pill. Problem is: Since I've been taking it, my libido went to zero. I've tried several different pills, but they all had the same effect: I don't want to have sex anymore - and I don't even have the urge to masturbate (which I did quite often before). 
When I don't take the pills, I look horrible (then I'm ashamed and I don't feel sexual either). But when I take the pills, my boyfriend doesn't get any sex as well. It's just a messed up situation.

2) My boyfriend is a VERY handsome man (part time model) - but when he tries to seduce me, he often acts like a child wanting to play with a toy. I'm exaggerating now, but just imagine him saying:""Uhh - look at them boobies"" (in a childish voice) and giggeling. It's a total turn off. Given my medical situation that doesn't help a lot...  

3) I used to be very unhappy with my body. I was never fat or anything - but I just didn't like it. Now I went from 71 kilos to 61 kilos (1,74m) and I thought it'll improve my sex live again - but nah... it didn't. I feel better now in general, but I'm still not comfortable in my body (to be honest - I never was, but that didn't have an impact on my libido a few years ago, so I don't know how this issue fits in...)

4) I used to like ""fancy"" stuff in bed - I like toys, I like anal, I like porn, I like role play - but my boyfriend (who was in for it in the beginning), doesn't seem to like it anymore.

Fortunately: We are talking about this issue quite openly and he knows that I'm willing to do something about my problem (even though I don't know what at the moment). And he also promises to think about his ""part"" in this. 

But still: I feel like an asshole for being that non-sexual woman every man complains about - especially because I really used to enjoy having sex - A LOT.

He made love to me a lot at first... now 4 times a month this month we've only made love once. I try to ignore it because he likes to hug, kiss, hold me, cuddle, grab my breast and ass. He pinches and kisses my breast a lot... that should be enough right? It makes me feel like shit that it isn't. I want to make love. I want us to have that close moment of being together like that more.

It sucks... We're so great together and happy yet... he hardly ever wants sex and I always feel like something is wrong with me. I have not gained weight and have gotten so better with emotions/mental things. WE never fight. I have actually lost a lot of weight because I am training to be a fitness coach.

He wanted to have sex yesterday but he stayed up to long and said we could tomorrow. It is tomorrow and he is not feeling it... he tired to cuddle me but still did not want too. I wonder ""You even try?"" 

Worse is he started watching porn again. It is not near as much but I always fear it will go back to that. I caught him twice watching it and touching himself makes me feel awful. Why can't he want me like that?

I told him if I looked like a porn girl then maybe he'd want sex and he said, ""Looking LIKE a porn girl is only worth a fap."" Well least it is something! 

I just want him... and I just wish he wanted me like I want him. I could have sex everyday or just give him a blow job everyday. I don't care. As long as we were close.

I feel bad because he is very friendly in other ways and it should be enough. But, I want sex. Even if it is just an extra two times a month... 

I'm so happy with him and we get along so great. And he says I am very sexy and pretty and loves when I am naked. And he'd rather me be naked all day long then have clothes on so he can admire my body and touch me and kiss me. And I love that but in the back of my head I beg him to do more than touching I beg and long for him to grab me and make love to me... and then it makes me feel like shit that his touching isn't good enough.

He has no problems in the sack or getting it up or anything. He just doesn't put any effort in trying to want it.

I am not looking for help just wanting to express myself. I know he can do more for our sex life. Stop playing video games all the time, work out, try harder at other things. But, he has no will to do anything right now. And I am putting my foot down soon but not about sex... but other things.

He is wonderful and so kind to me and we love each other so much.

Why can't I just toss out that sadness from lack of sex? Why does it hurt so? Why can't I just ignore it? I ask myself a lot.

Every night if he lays with me or is at work I touch myself fantasizing it is him and that he wants to have sex. I masturbate when he is at work and I am sleeping and fantasizing it is him. I tell him this and he likes the thought of me touching myself too him but he never jumps me like I long for in my head.

How can we have such a wonderful relationship and yet I still feel like somethings missing because he wont have sex with me more?

I just want to force myself to accept that kissing, touching, and cuddling is enough. Why is that so hard...

as I said not looking for advice just wanted to vent.

ACTUALLY: I do have something to ask... what do you do when you are denied? I hardly ever ask anymore and when I do I always get denied an I get very quiet because I am sad.

I just wanted to say thank you to you guys for coming forth and actually talking about these issues. I never realized till now how important a healthy sex life is in a marriage really until now.

Somewhere along the way in the last 5-6 years my Libidio has dropped off... Significantly. I wen't a good 3-4 years without sex and it didn't really bother me (both me and my wife during our 3 years before marriage decided on waiting till marriage). Well now we are married and the gloves are off so to speak and it's become very clear who has the higher libido of the 2 (and she's got a high one).

Not worried about cheating or anything like that. We've both made it pretty clear how we feel about that and that is a marriage ender for us. However, I don't want to passively contribute to what could be a weak moment down the road for my wife.

As much as I don't feel in the mood. I'm going to be naked and ready for my wife when she walks in the door (which for her should be a pleasant surprise (I hope lol)). I enjoy sex with my wife, she does too - I know she gets off, multiple times. We have great sex.

So I guess this post is kind of 2 fold. Wanted to say thank you guys for this subreddit and how it has opened my eyes to the possibility of a relationship slowly rotting away from the inside because of this. The second thing is more of a question:

How do you inspire your body to be more sexually hungry? I am stuck in between wether the problem is with my body, or if the problem is with the way I am viewing my wife. I have no problem getting aroused by other women (The see a hot women and heyoooo ready to go), but whenever my wife comes on to me I just really don't get in the mood, I'd rather be working on my video game, or doing something constructive on the internet. I almost feel annoyed that shes ready to go and I am not. I know she does it a lot out of trying to be a good wife, and wanting to please me (she has the best of intentions) but I just cant figure out why I am having such a hard time feeling sexually attracted to my wife. I mean during sex, I don't think about that. Once were having it, i'm in the mood good to go. It's just that getting up to it. Is it possible it's Low T? Or do you guys think this might stem more from a degradation of our relationship in some area? (That is a very real possibility too).

I (30m HL) get a decent (1-2x a week) amount of sex with my SO (31f LL-responsive desire), however it's been an uphill struggle to get the quality to a place where I am satisfied. After many talks, she still struggles with anything kinky (basically, any kind of dirty-talk, or anything slightly aggressive or vigorous).

She comes from a non-religious background, yet she is very conservative when it comes to sex. At most she will suggest positions, and give me direction...but not in a fun way. I feel like we're always rushing to orgasm.

I've re-arranged my entire approach to sex to make her feel more comfortable and at ease, we've gone through a few sessions of therapy (in which I was told that her sexual response is like starting an airplane and to deal with it), and we try to talk...but I feel like I'm the only one who brings stuff up. Even though she's been trying where she can, the improvements have been minimal. I just don't think she's a sexual person. Sometimes I feel like she just gives in to my advances for my sake...and I've had my share of consolation hand-jobs.

I don't see this getting any better and at times I wish I could end it, but outside of the bedroom it's the most romantic relationship I've ever been in. We are super affectionate towards each other (in a non-sexual way), and we really love one anothers company. I'm not sure how to deal with this situation.

I would say that we were closer in libido when married, but over the years mine has grown and hers has tapered off. I still love her, her body is that of a woman half her age, and still turns me on.

The DB problem grew over time, falling from every day to eventually once every three months or longer. She would reject advances, and I finally stopped making them. I tried solving my problem with porn, and with casual hookups, but both are so empty. I have/had no desire for an outside emotional relationship. So things went....

Finally, after many arguments/fights on this topic I sat down with her, told her I still loved her, but that we had three choices: A. Get a divorce B. Have a open relationship C. Work on sex and intimacy together. I told her my preference was ""C"" but I could live with the other two if she chose one of them. After a week she decided that ""C"" was what we would attempt, as the other two would always be options.

I told her in working on ""C"" I needed her to periodically initiate sex. If I do it every time I start to feel like I'm using her just for sex, which ruins it for me. I told her that she needs to verbally tell me what she likes, wants, needs, as I'm no good at reading her mind. I told her I need her to explore different positions and such, knowing that not all of them may work for us. I said that she was very good at expressing displeasure at what I did wrong in bed, such as lean on her hair or something, but I needed feedback on what to do right. I also told her that she has used up her quota of ""No!"" for the rest of our lives (half joking). 

So far she seems to be working very hard on improving this area of our marriage which makes me very happy, and that improves every other area of our lives together as I am less depressed and irritable. I know her motor is much slower to get started so I take the time to get it started. One way I do this is by sneaking under the covers when she is watching TV in bed, peeling her panties off, and going down on her for half an hour or so, telling her that I just needed a light snack and we don't have to have sex afterwards. The fact that I love burying my face in a woman's pussy is a benefit to me as well. Every single time she has been the one to yank me back onto the bed when I finish snacking and make like I'm leaving.

What's the point of all this? One year ago I was ready to bail even though I loved her because the lack of sex was destroying every other area of my life.

He had a porn problem that caused a dead bedroom in the first half of our relationship (you know, after the honeymoon period that keeps you going, thinking it will return?  Until I was no longer adequate fuck material to compete with his addiction?) and that led to a giant fight when I realized the extent of it, an ultimatum, and him swearing to change.  It murdered my self-esteem at the time and my feelings at the time, before I figured out it wasn't me, it was really him.

He swore off porn and joined the nofap club.  Which I wouldn't fucking believe (like, please) except that since then he has serious ED and premature ejaculation problems.  Now I can't overstimulate him and make him blow his load early (that's right, I have to lay like a dead fish or I ""feel too good"".  I can't dress sexy or do anything over the top, no dirty talk, lights off, missionary).  I can't show my frustration if he can't perform at all.  I can't complain about the world's most boring sex or I won't get sexed again til his ego recovers.  He swears that not jerking off makes him this way and that he can't jerk off without porn, to which I said, fine, use porn again.  But then he broke down emotionally and said ""I can't hurt you like that again"" so, there we were with that.  

Well months of that bullshit led to another ultimatum-- see a doctor about all this or I'm out, I can't live like that.  I said it much nicer than that but you know what I mean.  Doctor tells him he has low testosterone and prescribes him shots, which are covered by insurance and would be fine but you know.  He has a severe shot phobia.  He throws up when they get the needle.  SIGH.

So that leads to a prescription for the patch, not covered by insurance, $50 a month out of pocket and he bitches all the while.  Fine.  Still not seeing a difference, Low T my ass.

We had a big fight last night.  I was seriously fucking fed up to the point of tears (it drives him nuts when I cry about it like I'm some kind of monster for wanting to fuck my husband the same month we get married), I've been having wet dreams for like a week straight and I'm sad because we got married recently after 3 years of dating and this should be our fucking honeymoon period.  (No honeymoon, are you kidding me?  Blow all that money just to not get fucked in a tropical location where literally everyone else is getting laid?  No thanks!)  I told him how fucking depressed all this is making me and I got the standard, ""I'm working on it"" and ""I'm just tired!""

Today.  I ask him for help around the house and he does a total half ass job.  I end up re-doing everything he thinks he's ""done"".  I lose my temper and swear about it, which leads to his silence and passive-aggressive ""nothing's wrong"" bullshit.  We go out to dinner with my son and I am in a decent mood trying to make it nice for my kid.  Dinner is fucking stone silent between us.  I ask lightly, ""what's wrong?""

He says, in the same voice you'd discuss the weather today, ""it **turns me off** when you get angry like you did earlier.""

My brain froze and I tried to handle that remark without storming the fuck out of there or punching him in the mouth.  

*It turns you off, huh.  You say that in this little effeminate voice in the middle of a restaurant, limp dick under the table, dressed like a middle aged man with a receding hairline who's let his body go when I am supposed to work on mine to suit you and work on looking good constantly to TRY and turn YOU on, but one angry outburst turns YOU off.  What the fuck about me. Maybe it turns me off when you cum 25 seconds into sex, maybe it turns ME off trying to plead with you to fucking touch me, maybe it turns me off even fucking looking at you when I get hit on regularly by men that would gladly rock my fucking world.  I never use those words ""turned off"" because it fucking hurts your feelings, asshole.  I'm glad I TURNED you OFF because I had no idea you were TURNED ON in the first place!  Are you even capable of that anymore?!  What part of you turned off exactly?  Does that thing even fucking work?!* 

I really, really, REALLY wanted to go there tonight, my fellow DBers.  I repress my needs and my feelings and my desires for him regularly and, wouldn't you know... today I *turned him off*.  More turned off than the kind of turned off that doesn't fuck his wife for months at a time, somehow.  Whatever vague piece of him was turned on (but not enough to touch his wife) was **turned off**!  Cue the world's smallest violin for my husband, please.  &gt;:(

That is key! Be sure to spend lots of time reading or posting in this forum but only bring it up with your wife once every 6 months.

Step 2a: Tell her you just want to feel loved and you only feel love through sex (even though she tells you she loves you more than anything...clearly she doesn't, because low libido is bullshit and she really just enjoys frustrating you and forcing you to fake your contentment.) 
 
Step 2b: Speaking of fake contentment, outside of the bi-annual talk, be sure to act like everything is fine even though she has not done enough to satisfy you, because it's BRILLIANT to be quiet about the very thing she admittedly has a hard time bringing to mind!  Makes all the sense in the world! It's as genius as giving the silent treatment to a deaf person, see how smart you'll be? Also, be sure to keep track of exactly when you have sex so you can assault her with the info when the time is right. You sly devil you! With all that fake contentment she'll never see it coming!

 
Step 3a: When she tells you she knows you have physical frustrations and that she'd rather you bring it to her attention so that she can make a point of resolving it instead of you silently resorting to porn, be sure to be a coward and avoid that uncomfortable moment! After all, even though she's LL, she should be thinking about this all the time. How dare she ask you to ASK for it. She's so lazy!

 
Step 3b: When she asks you to ask for it...by all means DO NOT do it! She is trying to come up with anything that can help fix her failing....do not help her!!!!!! BE OFFENDED BY IT! That will show her!
 
Step 4: Run back to reddit instead of talking to your wife. Pretend she didn't tell you that she would never withhold sex from you, or that she needs you to ask for it because she knows (thanks to you) that she's a miserable FAILURE and doesn't have the libido of a ""normal"" woman. Proceed to align yourself with all the other sexless crybabies that get their comfort from reddit instead of manning up and getting real with their wives. Cause, you know...watching porn and bitching on reddit is waaaaay easier than being REAL and telling her you are needing her. Especially if you have to do it every day! Who does she think you are? Someone that's willing to try anything to save your relationship? Stupid asexual woman!! Clearly she is selfish. Remind her that if it were important to her she would make it happen...but it has to be natural and out of desire, not out of wanting to make you happy. She has to get it right!  All those bitches and their quest to make you men miserable! How dare they! Men shouldn't HAVE TO ask!

Step 5a: When she does initiate, be sure to ignore how she can't seem to get enough of you, she bites and sucks your lips, licks you, squeezes you with any intimate muscle she can, places your hands on her ass and tells you how she likes that, climaxes every. single. time. and acknowledges that it's been too long and how much she loves being intimate with you once her mind can transition there. **Reminder!! Ignore all of that in your quest to never make things better!
 
Step 5b: Be sure to tell her that when she does initiate, even though you act like you like it and are into her, you're really dissatisfied with previously described effort. She should ABSOLUTELY be able to read your mind and magically provide you with whatever non vanilla idea you have. And who does she think she is? Initiating after 6 weeks!?! Bitch please, how selfish...she should have just continued selfishly depriving the man she loves so you could go on being upset with her.
 
***Hang in there! Just a few more steps. You're doing great and you're in the right place! This forum has an impressive rate of men that have succeeded in continuing to fail! A very wise investment of your time...keep reading!
 
Step 6: When you're really ready to emotionally castrate her, come back to reddit and complain about her and mock her. You deserve to be happy! She does NOT deserve your best effort! She's lucky for the misleadingly gentle talks you gave her! If she wants to know how you really feel, she'll need to look HERE!  Be sure to favorably comment on the battle cry to CHEAT and for God's sake DON""T TELL! This is HER fault and you have rights dammit! Make lots of comments about how stupid it is to get married. You're a big man! Belittle your wife on the Internet! Do it! She does not deserve your respect! Imply that you are staying in the marriage only to avoid losing money, having to get a new residence, and not getting to see the kids as much. You are on roll now! Just remember that this is the mother of your children and the woman who gave herself only to you, and these steps may have heartbreaking collateral damage. Maybe even guilt. But if you feel shitty...blame that on her too...she forced you to this place after all. Selfish woman....by your posts on reddit it should be clear to her that she is much more to you than just a broken wife. 
 
Final Step: Go back to reddit (you guessed that? high five!) and commiserate with all the others that forfeited their sex lives because they invested their honesty in reddit instead of their relationship. And lastly, ignore the crying that results.

M, 30) for almost 5 years. When I first started seeing him, sex was frequent but extremely vanilla. I let it slide because he was/is super cool, and I had just got out of a crappy relationship but with awesome sex so I was trying not to compare the two. 

Slowly but surely sex became less frequent. He also has these weird hang ups about specific things in relation to sex, like we both have to be freshly showered, and we can't have had an argument in the past 72 hours, and he would *really like* for me to be shaven on most, if not all, body parts. Not a huge deal, but really tiring to deal with in the long term.

Sex has dwindled down to about once, maybe twice, per month. He doesn't even go down on me anymore, and that means I don't orgasm. I use my vibrator every time during sex now because of this (it used to be an accessory, now it's a staple). He hasn't gone down on me in probably about a year now. 

And honestly. Even if he tries, I won't let him. He's made so many off the wall comments about my body hair or a smell or strongly suggesting I shower (for the second time that day) that I don't even want him down there. I can't deal with it. I'd rather just get it over with. 

Last night, same as usual, I was pretty horny. I didn't feel like going through the whole thing, so I was just going to use my vibe and go to bed early, but he was right there in bed next to me and wanted to have sex. So we did. At least we still have sex. I guess.

Afterward we spooned, and I was little spoon for once and it was nice. I ended up crying myself to sleep. Not only do we not have sex, I also feel like we have an emotional disconnect. 

I'd rather have no sex than something so meaningless and half-assed. I wish there was something in it for me. I wish we tried out different things. I wish he'd work out a little bit and at least try to be fit, even a tiny bit (I've gained a lot of weight so I'm no saint. Don't look at me like that - I'm losing it again at least!) I miss having dirty, freaky sex. I've started thinking about my shitty ex again - hate the guy and I wouldn't even talk to him again even if I could, but I miss the sex. 

Like everyone else out there, I've brought these things up to him and he'll come up with an excuse or say 'I'll try' and then it goes nowhere. I just feel so sad. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I feel so confused about CRYING about all of this last night and I have no one to talk to about it.

****
Hello,

(26/m) here. I have been together with my SO(25/f) for 6 years now. I realy love her and dont want to leave her but our sex life is near-death for quite some time now.

She is always very passive and unresponsive during sex, I feel like I have to do everything on my own. Even when she tries to initiate it she just gets nacked and lies down and waits for me to do everything.

I carress her, kiss her, finger her and then penetrate her, but she is pretty unresponsive to it most of the time. We usually fuck until my stamina runs out and she does moan a bit at the end(and I'm very glad for that), but she rarely comes(and then usually with clit stimulation) and her orgasms arent realy discernebale. She never wants me to eat her out or use the toys we bought for her, and she never does anything on her own. I dont know if I just have unrealistic expectations(because she was my first) but to me its very unsatisfying the way it is. Often I dont even want to have sex because from her passiveness and unresponsiveness gives me both the feeling that she doesnt realy want it or finds it pleasurabe, and that I dont realy get anything back from her.

We talked about that and she says she enjoys the sex we have and I asked her multiple times to at least sometimes tell me when she orgasms, or that she tells me if something feels good or if I could do something different but she didnt say a single word about this. I told her that I'm not happy with our routine but she seems unable to change that whole passiveness thing. Sometimes I wish she was just a bit enthusiastic about it.

I'm hoping a bit for tips how to improve our sex life. At the moment I have to motivate myself to have sex with her everytime because it just became a chore with little pleasure to me.

1351118114.0,21,self.DeadBedrooms,12161m,My wife (29f) doesn't want to have sex and I'm (32m) losing physical attraction to her as a result,28,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/12161m/my_wife_29f_doesnt_want_to_have_sex_and_im_32m/,"Some backstory:

I am a childhood victim of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. I buried it for a long time and covered for it by basically fucking anyfemalething that moved when I was adult. I dealt with confused sexuality as a result of the abuse and shamefully took it out on gay kids I knew in high school and university as a way to prove to myself that I wasn't gay and it didn't make me gay. I was still in the trap of thinking that there was something wrong even if it did. 

Anyway, the bottom line is that I buried a ton of this stuff, never dealt with anything, just treated it with casual sex and applied it liberally.

Then I met my wife. She came from the exact opposite of an upbringing. She was nurtured, loved and made to feel safe at home. She encouraged me to deal with these emotions. I resisted at first because I was afraid it might dry up my sex drive.

We ended up getting married and our sex life was pretty good. A healthy 3-5 times a week. I finally relented and started seeing a therapist. While my sex drive didn't dry up, I became weird about her performing certain sexual functions on or with me. It was just too close to home and the wounds were re-opened. I struggled for over a year to get over that and be able to be a full sexual partner with her again, and I succeeded.

The economy being what it was in 2009, we had no choice but to move in with her parents. Not optimal, but it was food and a roof and they're very supportive people. It was also right around this time that her sex drive took a massive nosedive just as I was starting to feel comfortable with myself. She said at the time it was because she had gained weight and we were living with her parents (although our bedroom was in the basement, theirs was 2 floors above us). 

She said things would be better when we were on our own. Lo and behold, I found a really good paying job in my field. It meant moving across the country, but we already had agreed before we got married that wherever the first real job was, that's where we would go together. 

At first, I understood that she missed her mom, being so far away, but 2 months later, we were having even less sex than before. Then she claimed that things would get better on that front when she got a job. She got that job 3 months after we moved. It's now been over a year and I can count on one hand the number of times we've had sex since we moved.

I am sick and tired of my hands being pushed away, of her emotional needs and demands being met while mine go completely unfulfilled. I have not and will not cheat on my wife. I come from that reality and kids or not, it's a shitbag thing to do. I am bored with and annoyed by porn at this point, but I still use it so as to at least keep my nuts from going on a full scale revolution and in constant discomfort.

I love my wife, but as a result of our lack of intimacy, I feel less attracted to her, and that depresses and scares me most of all. I've tried talking to her about it and she says to not give up on her, but part of me kind of has on the sex front. I know she's not cheating because she really doesn't have the time in her schedule. I know though, that I've been having wet dreams for the first time in like 15 years and she isn't the star of them, and that makes me feel ashamed.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Before I met my wife, I honestly believed that i just wasn't able to have a healthy bank account and a satisfactory personal life. When I met her, it seemed like complete bullshit...now I'm not so sure. For the first time in my life I have a job that not only pays the bills but is on an actual career path, but I go home and the best  thing I can look forward to is dinner and Netflix new releases. When we were struggling, I was selling stuff sometimes just to pay our few bills, but I was happy with her and I know she was with me.

I just don't know what else to do. I've remarked to my wife that she's the sweetest person I've ever met who would never hurt anyone--except me. To that she admits its because she knows deep down, that I won't leave her, but that everyone else (including her family and friends) might. My mom used to do this grandstanding ""I'm leaving"" bullshit all the time and I always found it so weak and childish because she never meant it, and had no follow through. Similarly, even if I threatened it, I'd be just as full of shit, and other than being accused of being like my dad, being like my mom is the worst thing I can ever imagine being.

Sorry if I'm rambling at this point. It just feels like when she's had a bad day, she can have a cuddle. When she cries, my shoulder is there. When she needs to vent about her sister driving her nuts or something about her work, my eyes and ears are open. It's not that she doesn't do all that for me when I've needed it, but on the deepest emotional level, she's just not there and I'm completely alone. We keep talking about kids in a couple of years, while deep down I have no idea how it would work. I won't go from being sexually rejected to being used for an endgoal in mind.

I'm frustrated and angry and sad, and I just don't know what to do or say anymore, other than I love her and I wish she would let me/tell me how to fix things, because I don't deserve to have to wait for the emotional fulfillment that my soul craves.

I've tried everything over the years - multiple talks, got into shape, 100% of the chores for extended period of time, extra nice guy, 'alpha', counseling, etc.  None of it has worked.  I get fed a diet of sex though an eye dropper.  And the eye dropper contains distilled water, nothing more.  I am always kept hungry for more.  The only time things have been what I would consider 'normal' is during vacation (pre-kids) or when we were trying to conceive.  Of course, while these times are 'normal' for me, she views them as sex-fests.


Looking to try something rather than nothing, I scheduled a night-in for us on August 19th.  I thought everything went well.  We had desert, played a boardgame and sexy time afterwards.  This was meant to occur every Sunday.  Maybe this is what we needed?  Just time explicitly set aside for the two of us after the kids have gone to bed.  So the second Sunday rolls around and we spend two hours together working on my son's baby book.  We go up to the bedroom afterwards and she proceeded to lay down like a corpse until I took the hint and left.  I learn the next day that she was feeling 'pressure'.  And like that, Sunday night date night dead.


I was frustrated and out of ideas.  We talked again and I told her that the ball is now in her court.  I'd support anything she wanted to try, except not trying anything.  She then proceeded to not do anything, so I did the same.  No more cuddling in bed, no more coming up behind her, spooning etc.  I shut off completely.  So one night in bed she says 'we used to cuddle' to which I replied 'I know'.


This has been going on ever since.  Fast forward to Saturday Sept 29th and I notice she is hanging around me and she blocks my path out the door.  We exchange some flirty words and she says 'want me to take care of you?'.  Before anyone reading this gets excited, that is code for a handjob.  Distilled water, remember?  So I asked her 'Are things changing?  Will it be another month before we do this again?'.  She didn't reply.  So I started to walk away and she said 'So you'd rather get nothing at all?'.  'Yes', I replied.


That meager handjob was awfully tempting.  Especially after getting nothing since Aug 19th.  My penis was yelling at me for the rest of the day and into the next.  It is so tough to stay strong.  I am starting to crack.  Had that offer been more, I would have given in.

This is my, very long, version of my descent into and subsequent climb out of my own DB.  It has a happy ending.

A little over five years ago, my husband and I decided to move in together.  That was when the sex stopped.  Not everyone can pin it down to the day but we are one of the ""lucky"" couples who can.  I was still just as into him but he started to reject my advances.  At first he didn't have to make excuses, I made them for him:
-When we moved in together, his long-time ex told him it was over for good.  This may seem obvious, but maybe it freaked him out.
-Neither one of us had ever lived with our SO and it was a big step.  Maybe he wasn't quite ready and I'd pressured him into it.  Aside from that, we had some personal habits that didn't always mesh well and we were dealing with those.
-We were stressed about money and I was making more than him which made him feel less manly.
-I wasn't on BC and maybe he was worried about the possibility of adding a new person into this mess.
I made all of these excuses and more for him.  

From my viewpoint, he was telling me that he loved me but withholding the physical affection that I needed to feel loved.  I, in turn, reacted by becoming depressed and super sensitive about everything.  I started picking fights and eventually he got frustrated enough to tell me that my advances were making him feel like a piece of meat.  This was a slap in the face for me as I've always been a very physical person and he'd never seemed to have a problem with it before.  

It was a full three months after moving in before he consented to sex again.  I was so excited.  I thought we'd made it through the bad parts and things would get better.  I was wrong.  

He got a new job and was always tired and sore.  He hurt his leg at work, had surgery and then needed physical therapy.  I got a new job and put on weight.  We moved into a more expensive rental and money remained tight. He still felt my advances were too pushy and, in his words, ""ham-handed.""  I got on BC and, while it didn't lower my libido, it did affect other aspects of sex which made me more self conscious and awkward. My self-esteem dropped so low I wasn't sure that it existed anymore.  EVERY fight came back around to the same thing: sex.  During all of this time, I was lucky to get sex three or four times a year.  He was still watching porn and masturbating regularly, but wasn't interested in sex with me.

He was staying up late playing video games and I had to be up early for work.  He met a married woman while gaming online and she sent him naked pictures of herself.  When I found them, instead of coming clean, he lied and I caught him in the lie.  In his opinion, it wasn't that bad since they had never met in person and it was ""innocent.""  This was probably the worst thing for me and at this point you, whoever you are, are probably wondering why I didn't leave him.

And the truth is, I don't know why I didn't.  Maybe I was too far down in a hole to see any way out and maybe I didn't want to throw away all of the work I'd put into our relationship.  Maybe it was because, when we weren't fighting, he was my best friend and the good times were AMAZING.  Whatever the reason, it took a good year or more before he truly regained my trust.  

More life changes occurred.  We both lost our jobs. We moved to a new city more than 1000 miles from our old one, leaving behind family and friends.  I got a new job right away but he was unemployed for nearly one year.  He stayed up all night playing video games.  I still had a hard time trusting him and also felt like he wasn't trying to get a new job if he was sleeping all day.  He did get a job but then we were on opposite shifts.  Life happened, fights happened, good memories happened... Sex did not.  I spent a lot of time talking, not to him, but to others who tried to help me.

By the time we were engaged, I was lucky to have sex twice a year.  I was, and still am, so in love with him that I decided I could try to survive without sex.  It was so bad that, no, we did not have sex on our wedding night.  Yes, I cried and was forced to initiate two days later.  Still, every fight led back to sex and now it was worse because, in withholding sex, he was preventing us from having the one thing I'd always wanted and he said he wanted: A Baby.

After one particularly brutal fight, we finally sat down and worked out a deal.  He would have sex with me at least once a month and twice in certain months- birthday month, etc.- and in exchange, I would work on not pressuring him.  There were compromises.  For instance, he wasn't allowed to watch porn until two weeks after we next had sex and he still owed the same amount of sex.

By this time, sex was so awkward that he fully admitted that he didn't even know how to initiate.  But it got better.  What started out as, "" Would you like sex?"" out of the blue became a kiss or two in bed before asking.  I grew more confident that I wouldn't always be rejected and started trying again.  My self-esteem grew.

Then, not quite a year into this deal, something changed.  It started with him noticing me looking at lingerie online the day after we had sex and progressed to us talking about sex in a non-confrontational manner.  We ended up purchasing some couples toys to try out.  What had been a chore has become something more interesting.

Not everything is fixed but we have made great progress that I once thought impossible.  We talk and rarely fight.  We try new things.  We've reached the point that I feel comfortable offering to pleasure him without expecting something in return.  I no longer wonder ""When will the next time be?""  because I know it's coming.  I even turned him down for the first time ever.  Hold on.  It can get better.

A little background: [24F] and [28M], on-and-off for two years. My partner is actually as close to being asexual as a heterosexual male can be, though he's in denial about it. We have sex once (twice if I'm lucky) per month. I would be able to tolerate the sexlessness with relative ease if we had any other form of intimacy; cuddling, communication, verbal and/or physical cues alluding to love, a commitment. I have asked for more affection several times, after which he tries harder for no more than a day. We live together and share the majority of our friends. We get along very well and usually have a lot of fun together, as long as I'm able to keep my dissatisfaction suppressed. We honestly are platonic friends that appear to be ""romantic partners"" to outsiders.

Last night was his last night home before going out of town until Sunday. He wouldn't snuggle with me, he wouldn't hold me, he wouldn't touch me. He doesn't like when I touch him, but laying there in bed, I was almost physically in pain from my desire for human contact, even just a hand to hold or a kiss on the shoulder. I felt so unloved and unsexy and unappreciated that I turned over and cried. And then something snapped in me. It was so disrespectful of him to not try to please me in the slightest. If he loved me, he would make some sort of effort to ensure my happiness. He knows exactly what I need and want and he makes no effort to step outside his own comfort zone for me. 

So, it's over. Not formally, not until he gets back and I'm able to talk to him, but my heart's been removed from the situation. I'm not really sure how to explain it in a way that doesn't insult him, because I'd like to remain friends and roommates (I'll move into the spare bedroom). Last summer, when we broke up, I gave him no room to NOT be my friend, but inviting him to a weekend away with friends immediately. It worked swimmingly, and our friendship was better than ever. At least until he became aware that I was dating again, got possessive and confessed his love to me (from completely out of the blue) and we got back together. I'd like to prevent that from happening again.

So, any feedback or suggestions on how to break up, how to live happily as friends and roommates, and how to prevent jealousy when I begin dating again?

1343620837.0,23,self.DeadBedrooms,xdhxr,Married 3 years. Sex about once a month. Ugh. Advice?,28,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/xdhxr/married_3_years_sex_about_once_a_month_ugh_advice/,"Ok, so....basically the title says the gist of it.  I would initiate sex damn near every day when we first got married.  Sadly, I was shut down about 75-90% of the time.  At some point in time my ego (or something) decided to back down. I would ""only"" try about 3-4 times a week, but my success rate was about the same.  I'd get laid on the weekends, but that was about it.  Sooner or later my mind just stopped thinking about sex because I hardly ever got it.  I feel like I basically just re-programmed my brain to not try anymore.  She never seemed to want it, and would shut me down, so I just stopped.

Problem now is that she wants it more....but I don't.  I think it has something to do with the constant trying and failing that has caused my brain to just shut off that section of itself.  It's not that I actively think, ""No, I do not want sex"", I just don't think about it very much anymore.  I mean, I jerk off basically every day still, but actually having sex doesn't really happen any more.

Example: Today I went into our room to get something.  My wife was lying on the bed in just her bra and panties, reading a book.  I didn't think twice about it. I just grabbed my cell phone charger and left.  Later she was in a bad mood.  I asked why.  ""Well, I obviously wanted sex, but you didn't even care that I was lying on the bed, half naked.""

See, that's the thing....I noticed it, but my brain didn't even come close to a ""she wants sex, you should put the moves on her"" type of thought.  Is there a way to get that part of my brain activated again?  I feel like somehow I've friendzoned my wife....

I've been able to use my bucks to get him naked by using the ""choose a sex outfit"" coupon!  One time I used it to lead into sex.


Yesterday, we were cuddling in the middle of the afternoon and I was about to ask him if he wanted to fool around.  But, then I remembered it was ""that time"" which is a no-go for me (orgasm does NOT make cramps feel better...)

I think she's trying to prepare me for a VERY LONG dry spell.,24,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/svngg/obgyn_appointment_for_her_i_think_shes_trying_to/,"I've posted here before as part of my introduction, but wanted to share my email to my wife with you. I don't know how it would help me, other than hear from you on how my email sounds. There is pretty much nothing that can currently be suggested that I haven't tried or asked her to try. Am I too hard on her? Not hard enough? Or like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, was it just right? Am I just an ass. Fuck. I'm a bundle of emotions. 

She went for her 6 week postpartum checkup yesterday and mentioned a few things about what her and the doctor talked about. It really made me feel numb. I became quite quiet, as I don't like to get angry and fight with her. I didn't ask her about the appointment as it always feels like I'm about to get some shitty news every time she goes to a OBGYN, however she volunteered information that our birth control until my vasectomy was **abstinence**, then laughed like it was a funny joke. The background is that she thinks she has lichen sclerosis, which I am absolutely adamant she doesn't have. We have 2 kids together now, and 1 each from previous relationships. Sex has been dismal to say the least since the first pregnancy. 

I think I am assertive, stating my needs, but every time I email her, I end up getting nowhere...

&gt;I read your comment on Facebook that I'm a great husband and dad. It was a cute comment, but for all I try to do to be a patient husband, I get frustrated and confused. Maybe I can be a better person and just never say anything about what I need, but I just can't. What I hear from your lack of intimacy or sex with me, is that you really don't want me as a husband. You want me to be a celibate father and friend that helps you raise kids. You can't kiss your husband. Or touch me sexually. My sexual needs are dismissed and not acknowledged. You want a practicing monk to raise kids with.

&gt;I appreciate that you want to tell me what happened at your doctor appointment. Your comments trigger lots of emotions and confusion for me. Hearing comments like ""it's normal post-partum to not have sex for 6 to 9 months even without lichen"" makes me upset. It's like you are telling me in a round about way that I'm not going to have sex for years. You won't ask for a second opinion on lichen. You won't get one. And you put a steroid cream all over your sensitive parts. Why won't you get a real diagnosis? ""Doctors can look at severe lichen sclerosus and know what it is. But usually, a doctor takes a small piece of the skin patch (biopsy) and looks at it under a microscope. This allows doctors to make sure that it is not a different disease."" Looking at you and at pictures of severe lichen, you don't look anything close to those pictures. You look the same as when we met. Why won't you look into other things? I've read lots on OTHER things that can cause pain. Hormones. Your anti-depressant causing libido issues, and therefore not making you ready for intercourse and in turn causing pain.

&gt;Then the comment about practising abstinence for our birth control just hurts. I don't want abstinence. I want a sex partner that cares to please me, and is open to a fun, fulfilling sex life. I want an adventurous sex life. With you. Fuck. I want kinky sex, outdoor sex, making love sex, dirty sex. I want it all. With you.

&gt;Going a year or more without intercourse may be normal for some people(very few people), but it's not for me. Even for couples that do not have intercourse, they at least do other things. Oral sex, handjobs, making out, boob sex.Even if I could just nurse from your boobs and touch myself, it would be something. Going a year or more without ANY SEXUAL CONTACT is not normal. It is crippling. Except for people that practice abstinence. And those people aren't in a relationship. I am not a celibate priest.

&gt;You make comments about not having sex for such a huge length of time as if it is normal. You don't seem to care one bit about me and my wants and needs during this time. This coming month it will be 6 months since our 1 time having sex and before that in August camping where we didn't really have sex but I pestered you and was in you for a few seconds. I've gone 3 years since I've had oral sex. 3 long years.

&gt;When I suggest that maybe I should look elsewhere as it looks like we are not going to have a sexual relationship, you question the man you are with. I would have never thought when we got together that I'd be asking you, the woman I love more than anything, and am so incredibly attracted to, if I can have sex with other people. I don't want that. But I also can't be in a sexless marriage. 

&gt;You say that you ask me to sit next to you and ask me to sit closer. But that's as far as it ever goes. You may ask me to rub your back or feet, but you never sexually touch me. Or you say that I don't communicate. If I know that I am never going to have my sexual needs met, it is a huge roadblock to wanting to be close in other ways. If I knew you wanted to try to overcome this sex embargo with me, I wouldn't feel so rejected and dismissed.

On the one hand, people are angry and I want to let them be angry. Even a certain amount of misogyny or misandry is understandable. Wrong, but understandable. On the other hand, I want people here to feel supported, which means anger or hate from other posters isn't okay. Even if it's somebody complaining ""I only get it twice a week"" I don't want them to feel hated. About the only thing I don't want tolerated is outright blanket insults - ""You all aren't getting laid because you're unattractive"". That kind of thing is hurtful and unproductive.

So my moderation policy is that insults are unacceptable, but anger is okay... and angry insults? Well, I guess that's a case for warnings. Either way, bans are a tool of last resort - I'll just remove the offending posts if it's something we don't want in here.

Obviously, habitual shitposters need to be banned... but fortunately that hasn't come up yet.

I've maintained my thrice-a-week workout schedule and am now in better shape than when we met. She hasn't broken a sweat since 2010. The three years of napping and snacking have taken their toll and I'm just plain not attracted to her. We recently celebrated our 1-year anniversary and her gift to me was *sexy lingerie*. Pretty cool right? Except the stockings wouldn't fit over her knee because of her swollen thighs and her once magnificent, swimmer's backside was like a bag of marshmallows. I feel like an awful husband for being so shallow, but I can't deny that I was outright *repulsed*. It's like she aged 20 years since college.

We are both interested in sex about 3-4 times a week and we would be having it too, if not for her complete neglect of her body. I have tried *everything* to get her to work out. 

I've tried being really supportive ""Come run with me, it'll be fun. We'll spend time together"" etc. I've tried being a bit mean, ""Maybe if you exercise a bit, we'll have more sex. *wink*"" I've tried being honest and drawing attention to the problem: She gets naked, I remain completely flaccid. I've tried to boost her confidence with date-nights, affection, flirting, surprise sex. So far: nothing.

So, unless anyone has a novel idea to get her off the couch, how am I supposed to deal with this? She keeps announcing that ""We need to have sex more"" then does selfish shit like eat OREOS FOR BREAKFAST. It's infuriating, and at the same time she's so damn sensitive that if I suggest that *maybe* she shouldn't be having two brownies with lunch she's upset with me for days.

My wife(F-28) and I(M-29) have been married close to 6 years. Two children, ages 4 and 2. Our sex life has had its ups and downs. Before we got married, sex life was excellent, like usual. Once we got married ,it slacked off, but still averaging 2-3 times a week. After we had our first child, we went a period of 6 months where she didn't want any, but her sex drive quickly picked up. Now for the past two years, we've been averaging once a month. 100% initiated by me and you can tell she's just doing it to please me.

So, yesterday evening. The kids were away at their grandparents and my wife asked if wanted some because I had mentioned something about it earlier in the day. So, the usual, I get the lube, she turns around(doggystyle) and I go at it until I get off. No foreplay, nothing. Well, this time after going at it for a minute or so, I realized I can't keep doing this. It felt like making love to a corpse. So, I pulled out and said ""I can't do this anymore...""

I told her every feeling I had. That since she's not enjoying herself, I'm not enjoying myself. I told her that I didn't want to make it seem like she was ""boring"" but I would rather not have sex if both parties weren't into it.

I guess I need to go more into detail. Ever since my wife had our last child, she hasn't had a monthly cycle and she put in an IUD last year. I'm sure that has quite a bit to do with it.

Anyways, my wife said that she wants to have a sex drive and wants to be a ""freak in bed"" but doesn't have the drive. When my wife and I have sex, she will usually use a vibrator before, during, or after sex to get off.

She didn't know we were at war, she just knew she didn't want to have sex with me. Oh, she didn't say that. She'd say, ""We just had sex *two* weeks ago! Why do you want it again?"" She'd tell me I was lying if I countered that it'd actually been *six* weeks. (Note: this is why you want to keep a sex calendar. It's **great** for countering bullshit.)

A year ago (or so) she was comparing my asking for sex to her asking me to take out the garbage.

She'd told me that all of her friends and sisters only have sex every few weeks, so my wanting it more than that meant that I was a sex addict.

I'd get the 'elbow crimp' when I'd try to get things started at night. The elbow crimp is her tucking her elbow into her side and tensing her arm so that I couldn't have access to her breasts.

I've heard every damned excuse in the book, ""I'm too tired,"" ""I haven't taken a shower,"" ""You haven't taken a shower,"" ""I have to get up early tomorrow,"" ""I'm stressed,"" ""You/you're family was mean to me today/this week."" You name it, I heard it.

My new woes?

* We have an extended house-'guest' staying with us. So I can't slap my wife's ass as hard as I'd like when we're doing doggie-style.

*  She has a public-facing job, so I can't leave bite-marks above the shoulder-line and she's ticklish everywhere else.

* The nipple-clamps keep slipping off and I worry that the more robust ones may be too painful her.

* I keep forgetting all of the dirty-talk that I've picked up from /r/sex. I've been out of school for twenty years and now I have to study again. (Hrm, maybe I should crib some phrases on the back of my hand before bed-time...)

* There is no harder after the third ""harder"", OK?  It's bangita-bangita, Bangita-Bangita and then BOOM-BOOM and that's it. Seriously, after that we're in pelvis bruising territory. Any harder and you're just a thumper, calling a sandworm from Arrakis.

* After sex last night, I pulled her on top of me for cuddling. I naturally got hard again and slipped inside of her. Ten minutes later I was drowning from the sweat we were creating and tried to separate and that caused a snoozy wrestling match with her because she wanted to fall asleep on top of me with me inside of her.


What I've learned in the past few years:

* You don't have to be a total asshole. Just don't be a pushover. People admire strength.

* I know everyone wants the other to initiate, but acknowledge that may not happen and deal with it. 

* She hasn't refused you if you haven't made a move. If you're laying next to her doing that ""should I or shouldn't I"" debate, just stop that and make a move. Notice I didn't say ""Ask"". What's worked for me: Start touching and massaging in **non-sexual** places. Shoulders and upper-back. Every 10th stoke make a whole body down-up-down-up stroke down her back and along her outer-thighs. After five to ten minutes of this your whole body-stroke should return up along the inside of the thighs. After a few times of this you can go for the breasts or do a firm stroke over her pussy on the up stroke.

* If her old boyfriends were ""jerks"" or you were a jerk early-on in your relationship, then she's attracted to jerks. If you want her to be attracted to you, then you need to increase your jerkosity. (In a responsible way.)

* You can't stop. Ever. I know that as soon as I stop trying, then that's when the DB resumes. I didn't hit on her for sex for six weeks late last year. Six weeks. What caused the drought to end? I initiated. I have no illusions about what would have happened if I hadn't initiated. It's up to me.

**For sexuality in general**: vitamin E, zinc, vitamin C (helps mucous membranes, if lubrication is an issue) and niacin (it helps blood flow to the genitals)-all of which are depleted by stress (physical and/or emotional)



**For men**: 

- zinc helps with sperm motility and development as well as prostate function. Low levels of zinc can cause a loss of sexual interest because testosterone production is influenced by zinc. 
- Magnesium allows relaxation as well as several sexual biochemical pathways.
- B6 to help balance testosterone (which is very common in men, estrogen dominance is prevalent because our drinking water is flooded with estradiol from birth control pills which competes with testosterone).



**Women**: 

- B vitamins help to regulate mood as well as several metabolic functions (including estrogen/progesterone balance). 
- Issues with iodine-deficiency related hypothyroidism can also be misdiagnosed as depression-which can contribute to low sex drive. 
- The birth control pill also increases copper levels in the body and depletes zinc, which can cause changes in sex drive. 


Also, sarsaparilla root helps stimulate the synthesis of steroid sex hormones.


If you need help finding out what foods contain which nutrients, I'll comment below. Obviously thing like anxiety, emotional issues, stress from work, finances, a strained relationship, a history of sexual abuse or any sort of trauma, mental illness, lack of exercise or hormonal issues can all contribute to loss of libido, but nutrition is an area that's often overlooked.

Today I come home and see a bottle of Liquid Silk (a lubricant), quite a bit of it missing.  I text him and he says he found it in the desk and was going to throw it away.  Just like when I saw porn on his pc a couple months prior (but after he said he would quit), he claimed he was in the process of deleting it.  And we still haven't had sex.

I had told him, after a ""talk,"" that I didn't mind if the general was out of commission (he has ED, unless he's watching porn).  We could do other things.  He said he knew that.  And we still haven't done other things.

I asked him why he didn't eat me out ever, even when I was pretty clear that I wanted him.  He said he didn't know.  I know.  He doesn't want me.  He just likes the idea of a girlfriend, and he likes having someone around to do things with.

I'm not sorry I lost weight.  I'm healthy.  At least this mess resulted in something good.  But goddamnit, what do I have to do to get him to notice me?  Nothing, nothing, nothing at all--he never will.  I'm just being a fucking idiot, sticking around because of promises and hopes.

They are not going to come true.

Ever.

He will never want me, no matter what I do.  Still a little place in my head whispers that he may, one day!  Maybe!  He could change, and he says he loves me, after all.

I've asked him to go to the doctor and he looks at me like I've got two heads.  I told him, gently, that it was time for professional help.  Yeah, that's not going to happen.  He firmly believes that it will go away on its own.  Well, I've been here almost 6 months...and it hasn't.

I am packing my shit.  I hope I'm doing the right thing.

Sex multiple times a day, oral both ways, role playing, outfits, dirty talk, dirty texts, pictures, videos (in a responsible way). However, a few months ago, my so said some very hurtful things and I can't seem to get over it. 

About two years ago I had a lump removed from one of my breasts, they were uneven and so I got implants. They are very modest and essentially just restored my breasts to the size they were before surgery. 

As a bit of back story I am an average weight about 135 and 5'5, well over the summer my SO made several comments about weight loss. None of them were malicious and mostly they were made because he doesn't have much of a filter and isn't very articulate, so I got over it. I am however very self conscious about my vagina, my labia are long and it's always been a point of embarrassment for me.  

A few months ago he asked me if I had ever considered Vaginal Reconstructive surgery. This coupled with the weight loss comments were just extremely hurtful, and I'm having such a hard time getting over it. He has apologized and he said that he only brought it up since I got implants he thought I might be open to another surgery that would improve me so I could ""look better for him"". 

Another aspect of this that bothers me is that I'm only his second sexual partner, he is not very successful with the ladies and somehow I have come out of this feeling terrible about myself. I have always had self esteem issues but as I've aged, graduated college and moved out of the sorority house they've diminished quite a bit, his comments have brought a lot of it back now. 

I can't seem to get over his comments, I don't feel sexually desirable anymore and when we do have sex I want it to be quick and with the lights off. 

The thing is though is that I don't have a LL, I masturbate daily and I enjoy sex, I just feel so uncomfortable naked around him now and I don't know how to get over it. I wish I could just flip a switch and unhear the things he said. 

I know that the issue lays with me and that I'm letting a few comments interfere so heavily in our relationship but I don't know how to get past it.

I got a HUGE blow to my ego last night. My partner and I are both in our early 30s and have been in a relationship for about 4 years, about 3 of those years we have had a mediocre at-best sex life. I hate saying that but it's something that has taken me a while to actually realize that because I sincerely love my girlfriend. (another thread for another day)

Anyway, in her defense she had been under a lot of stress lately (work, travel, etc). Although nothing too extremely out of the ordinary. I try to help in any way possible. Not to be crude but I just thought that maybe if I pleased her ""sexually"" and as selflessly as possible, maybe she would appreciate it and most importantly, physically and mentally feel a little better.

So I kiss her and touch her last night in bed. She seems receptive at first. And with all of our DB struggles, I decided to ignore my normal impulse to NOT be an initiator (I NEVER used to be like this). I thought, what the hell, I'm going to actually try to make love to my girlfriend and not go over all my insecurities in my head. Basically I just wanted to turn her on and go down on her then let her go to sleep. That was it. 10-15 minutes tops for the particular purpose.

As she seems receptive to my advances, I slowly kiss and lick the inside of her thigh. She abruptly asks, in a puzzled (not angry) voice, ""What are you doing?!"" I said something along the lines of ""What do you think I'm doing?"" I don't know wtf the deal is, but the way she said that, I felt like I got punched right in the stomach/heart. I rolled over and just silently cried for a few minutes in between feeling pissed off. I couldn't believe my partner of 4 years just asked me what I was doing when it was extremely obvious what I was doing. I don't know why I got so upset but I felt like a fucking kicked puppy (sad, huh?) and I've dealt with a lot of sex/intimacy issues in this relationship. She apologized and said she blurted it out on accident; she was half asleep, etc. (Although she was prepared to watch a TV show 'cept it hadn't downloaded yet!)

One thing I know is that I've always been confident as a lover; I've always been attentive, selfless, I learn what works and what doesn't. And I've had the experience. No, I haven't been with a million people but you know the difference between having sex at the age of 15 vs the age of 30, for example. But last night made me question all that, and then I started to think, what the fuck - maybe it's not me. Maybe she should be with a woman who she WANTS to be intimate with, and maybe I ought to be with a woman who is receptive to my sexual advances.

Anyway my sexual confidence is shot even more than it was before. It's hard to ""forget and move on"" from here, I'll never forget the words and the way she said it. I went from being a sexually confident and adventurous woman (when I met her), to someone timid and insecure.

Am I out of line for feeling so damn hurt? What would you do? What should I do? Thanks in advance, sorry to post on a throw away but she occasionally reads this sub. Although none of this is exactly breaking news or anything.

TLDR- Tried to go down on my girlfriend last night, she seemed confused/puzzled at my advances and asked, ""What are you doing?"" and took a serious blow to an already weak ego.

My story to today: I am a bit older than my wife, a five year difference. When we got married, the physical aspects of our marriage were great. Both of us took great efforts in remaining attractive to the other, often joking that we never wanted to become the kind of couple that didn't care anymore about how we looked to our partner. After about 8 months, things became rough. I lost my job due to a contract dispute (they broke the contract, leaving me high and dry without any notice) and soon the arguing became a regular thing... but nothing that couldn't be fixed. In hind sight, it was mostly just not knowing how to talk to each other effectively. After a few weeks of this, she went to her parent's house, called me and told me she was in the process of killing herself.

This destroyed me. I walked all night. I was terrified that I lost the woman I love. I kept blaming my employment situation... If only I had a job and was a real man, not a freelancer. 

When she came to the next day, following a night in the hospital, we talked on the phone for a few hours. We talked about how her parents lack of support for our marriage was affecting her. We talked about how her eating disorder from her past played into things. When I would try to say I felt partly responsible, she would get angry insisting that I was not the reason, but the recent fighting didn't help.

For the next 2 years, we have tried to move on. I don't bring up that night. The one time I did, it turned ugly, so never again. The work situation has changed immensely. We are doing better today than we ever have. She is pursuing her graduate work, as well as being very active in her field. Unfortunately this has left her little time for us. When we are together she is always to tired for anything. Given the chance to be out with friends, her energy is abundant. 

We haven't been physical in over 4 months. The occasional kiss, but only if I initiate it. No cuddling and definitely no sex (3 times in the last year). When confronted, she says so many things. “You are just way more experienced in what you like than I am.” “It hurts physically.” “I'm too tired.” “Your over stating how long it's been.” And this week, I finally said something. Her reaction? “I have never forgiven you for when I tried to kill myself.”

I wept. Almost 3 years have passed and I thought we had moved on. It blindsided me.  All I have been thinking about is how much I love her and how much energy I have put into this marriage since that night and what little I get back. I have considered an affair because I feel like my sexual needs are being held hostage as a bargaining chip for when we disagree. Emotionally, I feel like she loves me, but can't seem to remember all things we do when we are in love.

My apologies if this comes off in a disorganized mess and the length. I have just never said anything to anybody and.... well, I needed this.

But what to do?  I have mentioned divorce to her, but she begs me not too do it, saying that things will change. How long do I believe her? I've stayed on 4 occasions I promised myself I wouldn't. Sometimes I think I am a fool, but I love her and I want to believe her.

And now, she wants to talk about having a child in 2 years. I am so torn... but I know we are not ready to even approach that topic yet.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_11iqhy,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/11iqhy/its_been_so_long_where_do_i_go/,

But he didn't give up on me, and he finally figured out that he'd never get through to me by just telling me what he wanted in the bedroom.  He needed to tell me how the lack of what he *needed* made him feel.  Only then did i understand the gravity of the situation.

So, here's the first big secret* (it may be more helpful to the ladies, but certainly could apply to whoever is needier in the relationship): men don't always say directly what they want.  Sometimes they're afraid to.  They'll talk a great deal, and they'll be so direct about some things that it's easy to assume they're telling you all there is to everything, but that's not the truth.  If it's uncomfortable, or they think they're going to be hurt, they will often be vague or drop the subject easily when it's not going anywhere constructive.

Second big secret: men will put up with a lot that they don't like, to keep what they need.  This one doesn't need a lot of explanation with this crowd, i'm sure.

Guys, don't assume your lady is purposefully rejecting your wants and needs.  For all the credit we get for being the more “intuitive” gender, we can't catch every hint, and can't know the importance placed on something if you don't let us know without being vague.  You want sex, we get that.  You want the intimacy that presumably comes with sex?  We might not know that.  Some of us don't see the difference.

*genders specified are as per my anecdotal experience; people and mileage vary

I also bought some cute little outfits that he actually likes. I am satisfied, and so is he.

Things have been good now. I know that if we ever go through a rough patch like that again, things will get better and we have the ability to make it through. I never stopped loving him, but it is a lot easier to love him now.

Although something else that has become apparent is that nobody is really able to contribute anything new to the story and there is no such thing as a quick fix, at least posting leads to generally positive response and the assurance that you are neither alone or unreasonable. Whilst it's been reassuring and to some degrees inspiring, it's also been incredibly frustrating. A dead bedroom is not something that can be fixed with a bit of a Sade and a back rub, and it's an underlying psychological issue for either one or both partners, and it may / is likely to never go away.

Firstly, my story, which could be pretty much copied and pasted from every post on this sub reddit. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 6 years, and on the whole it has been amazing. I am as attracted to her as I was when we first met, and our relationship has grown into a more mature couple type dynamic without losing any of the fun. I am 30 and she is nearly 27, so I am always conscious of not taking away her youth by pushing is into a settled, boring lifestyle. We go out a lot for food, to gigs, the cinema - in many ways we are still dating. We've talked about marriage and both see it in our future but not for a long time, and only when we both feel like we want to (it's an obvious thing to say but I reckon you'd be surprised...)

So things are pretty good, apart from... and brace yourself for this... we've all but stopped having sex. When we started dating, we saw each other 3 or 4 times a week and would have sex most evenings. We're not the most sexually ambitious couple, but both have had previous partners and have a reasonable idea what we are doing. But after the first 18 months, our sex has gone down to once ever month or two. It was a fairly steady decline, ebbing to every Sunday morning (which I never find the most sexy time) to the point where it is nearly non-existent. I will go weeks of frustration, only for 3 minutes of sex to reassure me that things are okay and start my optimism that we are back on track, and then we go another 6 weeks without any action.

There are naturally some complications - my girlfriend lost her mum in her very early teens, and does not have a particularly supportive family. Her boyfriend before me cheated on her constantly, pressured her for sex and was an aggressive alcoholic (I guess he took the pressure of me for seeming like a good guy from the start). Her first boyfriend turned out to be gay. She underwent surgery a couple of years ago for ovarian cysts, and also suffers from IBS. She gained weight as a teenager, managed to lose it now, but has to work to keep her weight in check, which she does to great success. (To be clear, she is hot. I saw her in a bikini for the fist time last week and my erection has only just gone down). 

In comparison, I have had an easy life. However, I have definite passive aggressive tendencies, am naturally shy and a little bit awkward, and if I'm being honest, not that good in bed. I have maybe had ten partners, and have never had any complaints, but I don't think I've ever made it in to any women's fantasy list. In the last couple of years, I seem to be suffering slightly from premature ejaculation, likely brought on by my constant frustrated masterbation in the bathroom. I can last quite a while during foreplay, but in full penetrative sex (nice term) I last a couple of minutes at best. I also emotionally cheated on her about 3 years ago, and she found out. It was as far as I was concerned entirely innocent, and it meant nothing more to me than a couple of catch up emails exchanged with an ex-girlfriend, but she walked out on me for an evening and it has taken a while to rebuild. 

Quite personal writing all this on the internet. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that I fully appreciate why my girlfriend doesn't feel sexy most of the time. Her medical issues coupled with psychological things in the past would be more than enough to drop anyone's libido. We never talk about sex. I'm a bit of a coward about rocking the boat, and as she obviously has no interest, she doesn't bring it up. I've reached breaking point a couple of times when I've had to ask her if she is still attracted to me and why she doesn't want to have sex with me. She assures me that she is and she just doesn't want to have sex with anyone.

So my real problem is this. I know all of my faults. I know what I'm good at, what I'm bad at, an what I am king to work on things. Don't get me wrong, I'm not wallowing in self pity here. I'm becoming an increasingly confident guys as I get older, I take care of myself, I have good social skills, and I think if we ever did split up I would be okay. I'm not the greatest guy in the world by any stretch, but would like to think I tick a lot of the good boyfriend boxes (sex performance aside). I have a good job, take care of most of the bills, have a slim, athleticish build, do all the cooking and help out with the cleaning. We go out a lot, take lots of holidays and have a comfortable life.

I'm sure a lot of people here read through the posts and think the same as me - I already do most of these things. Okay, I don't do all of them, all the time. But why should I? It's been covered a lot, but why is it my job to fix everything, all on my own? And why does fixing everything involve me cooking, cleaning, back-rubbing, weigh lifting, shopping, alpha male-ing, snuggling without the expectations of having sex, not pushing but not being a push over? Why do I have to psychologically manipulate my girlfriend into having sex with me?

Like many other people have said, it's not like I want to be pounding her into the bed every night and having Skype sex on my lunch break. I want the occasional open mouthed kiss, a hand job and the feeling that my advances are not repulsive. That's the bit that hurts, and makes me start to resent her. She must know how I feel, surely?

If I had worked out that I had a drinking problem and it was making her miserable, I would really hope that I would be able to see that this was the case, and certainly if she pointed it out to me I would do everything I could to stop. So if she knows that no sex is making me miserable, then why doesn't she want to do anything about it.

A lot of the low libido posts on her have said that they simply do not see sex as an in anyway appealing prospect. And I can understand that. But there are many things in life that are sometimes a chore, like working, getting your hair cut and doing the washing up. However, if you didn't do any of latter 3, you would be a jerk. In my opinion, it's simply not acceptable to say you don't like it so you're not going to do it. It's the easy way out. 

I see it as like running. I didn't use to run, but my girlfriend was keen to start. I wanted to help her with her training, so despite the fact that I never thought about running, I went and had a 3 mile run with her. It hurt, and I was bad at it, and if I'm honest, I didn't really enjoy it. Plus, I felt a bit self conscious as I had to wear shorts and everyone could see me. But she wanted to go again, so we did, and I enjoyed it a bit more. I got better at it, and it wasn't so uncomfortable. Pretty soon we were doing 12 mile training sessions, half marathons together, we had loads of bits of equipment and knew all the tricks. We were pretty good at running. And we both enjoyed it a lot. 

After my girlfriend had run her marathon, we stopped running for a bit, and for a while, I was glad of the rest. But then her body started to crave the running again, so she wanted to start up again. I wasn't keen, but I always support her, so I decided I'd go with her. I didn't enjoy it very much, but we worked at it together... and you get the idea where I'm going with this analogy.

Plus I always run in lingerie, so it's pretty accurate really.

Sex is as key to the body as exercise. Plus in theory (even the way I do it) it's a lot more fun. Anybody in a loving relationship who can honestly claim that they are in touch with their partner's thoughts and emotions, should be able to see that if they are holding out on sex for whatever reason, they are depriving their partner of a key part of life. Is the occasional penis in your mouth or quickie in the kitchen really such a horrible thing to do for someone you love.

To pre-empt any of the usual advice, I don't want to cheat on my girlfriend, I don't want to break up with her, and I know that we need to talk more. And I'm quite clearly having a moan, and now I've got it out of my system will hopefully be able to get on with sorting it out

So I don't really have a question, or advice, or much of interest to contribute, but I had to voice my frustration. I will be taking a lot of the steps that I read in DeadBedrooms and all the advice and support is appreciated.

We have a tasteful home, I provide well, and we are able to accommodate the educational and recreational needs of our children.  I'm even sending her on a vacation with her friends to the Caribbean next month while I stay at home with the kids.

Yet, she expects more from me.

Yes, I've tried the romantic approach.  I've tried the macho dominating male approach.  I've been sincere and I've been spontaneous.  She  just isn't into me and has completely justified her lack of desire.

So, WTF?  This sucks!  I'm pretty sure that the only reason I'm still with her is the kids.  If I ask for a divorce she gets the kids and my paycheck.

Does this happen a lot?

For the first two years or so we  had a great sex life.  We had sex pretty often and we both enjoyed it alot.  Oral sex was plentiful as well.  Slowly things started to change.  Now sex is maybe twice a month, and oral sex is almost unheard of.  I havent given her oral sex in probably 2 years, though I am always willing.  There are a few theories I have about why this could be happening:

1) She has gained a lot of weight recently..she was probably around 110 pounds when we started dating and now is somewhere around 140.  (she's only about 5'2).  Maybe this makes her feel insecure and not want to do anything. I tell her I dont care all of the time but it doesnt help.

2) Before we dated, she had a ""bi-curious"" stretch where she dated a girl for about a year.  Maybe she is losing interest in guys again?

3) Cheating? She got caught this past week lying to me and going to hang out at her ex boyfriends house.  She claims nothing happened and a friend of the ex also says nothing happened, but its always a possibility.

I have just recently talked to her about the situation and she claims she does want to have sex more.  But it never seems like she will give it an honest effort.  If i don't initiate, it will never happen.  If i try and she's not in the mood, she gets mad. Any advice will help.

1340080322.0,24,self.DeadBedrooms,v9fgv,To the ladies in dead bedrooms: Please seriously consider that your partners may be suffering from secret erectile dysfunction before writing it off as low libido. ,27,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/v9fgv/to_the_ladies_in_dead_bedrooms_please_seriously/,"I've noticed a kind of recurring theme among the posts from women in dead bedrooms. While there's no doubt that there are plenty of men out there who legitimately have a low libido, I'd say about half the posts in this subreddit from women sound like the male partner is suffering from erectile dysfunction that they've been keeping secret, rather than a lack of libido. 

Ladies, before writing it off as low libido, please consider *very* hard whether it's possible that your partner is having trouble achieving or maintaining erections and may be simply avoiding sex rather than face potential embarrassment. 

Also, don't assume because your partner still masturbates that it can't be erectile dysfunction. Most men with ED can still masturbate. A man can masturbate with a semi-erect penis. They can't have sex with one, though.

Also, if your partner seems to have no problem achieving or maintaining erection on the rare occasions that you do have sex, this is also not an indicator that he doesn't have erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction can be very intermittent depending on the state of the body from day to day. Also, many men with ED can learn to tell when they're having a ""problem day"" or a ""good day"" in terms of potential erection and may avoid sex at times when they aren't absolutely sure they can maintain an erection. 

So, please, don't write it off as libido so easily. It may be that. But it may be that your husband is struggling with ED in private, which, although is EXTREMELY common for middle aged men, is still something many men will refuse to speak about with anyone.

Needless to say I am an active listener, had many variations of ""The Talk"" and had as many limited success as I have had limited failures.  Here is a snippet from our week of scheduled sex, paraphrasing my wife's comments.

""Already?"" - Hadn't had sex in close to a month.  

""You always start out the same way.""  While I initiating foreplay.  Almost killed *my* sex drive.  Almost asked her if she'd prefer to start.  In fact, I think the next time we have our scheduled week I will.

""That just killed my sex drive, you need to pay more attention.""  Apparently there is an angle that no longer works for her and she went out of her way to make sure it was my fault.  I calmly lay there and actively listened until she said, ""Perhaps you should have gotten more experience before we got together.""  Almost flipped my shit on this one.

""I just lose you some times.""  I've heard this one before and it really gets to me because I've done my best to try and 'carry' her along as we make love but she never gets very worked up.  At one point, about a year ago, we were making love after she had made this comment and it felt like two people who were doing their best to have the physical act of intercourse without enjoying it.  She just can't let go and enjoy sex except on very, very rare occasions, and it kills me.

Best compliment, wait let me rephrase, only compliment I got all week was:  ""That felt pretty good.""  On all the other occasions I instead got the harsh 'truth' that I'm a lousy lover.

And that's that.  No sex this week on the books.  I might try and initiate but we're towards that crappy half of the month that lasts about two weeks (one week prior, one week following with a few extra days thrown in for good measure).",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_v84ne,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/v84ne/scheduled_sex_had_sex_almost_wished_i_hadnt_rant/,

First two years were happy but the frequency worried me.  Before marriage, it was once a week.  After marriage, it was once a month.  Now, it's been three months.  We've gone as long as four months several times. 

I am very tired of begging to have sex after eight years of it.  When she's in the mood, she wants it right then.  When I was in the mood, I either got denied or I was made promises for 'this weekend' or something like that.  If I followed up on these promises, I got chewed out or I got the frustrated sigh and told no.  When I tried to work it out and discuss it, I was denied.  I've tried so many times to talk to her to ask to see if there was another issue, but I get shut down.

For a long time, I thought I was the problem.  Not being able to get to the bottom of it was the most difficult thing.  No one is perfect, but damn it, I am a good man and a good husband.  I listen, I talk, I share, I help out, I support.  I do what else I can do.  I work out at least 3 days a week and kept in shape.  In my late 30's, I don't have the libido issues some of my friends are talking about.  I'm as ready as ever, if not more so.  

Last week was my tipping point.  In these last three months, I grew more disheartened and frustrated the more I found myself watching porn on my computer and masturbating that she hinted after dinner that she was in the mood and I turned her down.  I didn't want it.  I didn't want the bother.

I didn't tell her why. I did a shitty thing and made up an excuse about being frustrated with work and some other side projects I have with different companies.   

I thought i'd feel shitty about lying to her, but I don't.  I know better though.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't.     

TL;DR After eight years of begging, I stopped caring and turned her down recently.  

Clarification- Denying her was met with anger.  She basically said that I needed to get it while she was in the mood.  

Clarification-  I don't mean begging like please please have sex with me.  Getting denied, asking why, which would be the begging part, then getting into an argument about it.

When dating my wife and I had a great time, we snuck off in the woods, fucked in the car...whatever. I don't expect that kind of risque activity after 13 years of marriage but we are both in our early-mid thirties and sex gets less and less every year.  We have two children and the intimacy seems to have obviously gone down since they were born.  To deal with planning, work and the kids we started planning nights to have sex. Twice a week mon and friday we would do the dirty unless one of us was sick or dead.

Twice a week was enough it seemed, dealing with the kids and whatever. I managed to beg/bribe more out of her every so often but not much.  This month the kids are gone, it's just her and I in the house while they visit my mom for a month. I haven't had sex in almost a week and I try to get her to fool around in the mid afternoon.  She isn't in the mood, doesn't want to fool around, maybe later....  A bit more talking and coaxing...she wants to go do something SHE enjoys, not just lay there with me. She'd rather gain 20 lbs than give me a handjob.

I can't explain to women how much I hate myself right now, how much I feel like I'm in a dead marriage and how much I just want to cry.  Whatever happened to the girl who woke me up with blowjobs or fooled around in the car, even though her dad was driving us to whatever place. Now fooling around isn't even something to be enjoyed, it's a chore.

Recently my SO has been directly stating (unsolicited by me) that she'll initiate sex that night/next morning/next afternoon, but never does. 

The vicious cycle is that she hasn't initiated sex, so I bug her about it, which puts pressure on her (understandably so), which kills chances for sex, which ....rinse wash repeat.

Just for the record I'm a 30f and my SO is 31m.

When he and I first started communicating he talked big about a lot of things that I was specifically interested in. After travelling to visit him a couple of times there just wasn't much going on but we couldn't get enough of the companionship element. I ended up moving across the country to be with him despite how little sex was going on. He seemed pretty depressed and I was patient.

Fast forward a couple of years and we average once a month. Maybe. Very brief interludes when they occur. Sex has become a serious point of contention. He swears he'll fix it but things stay the same.

I'm visiting back home and have a laundry list of things to take care of here so we've been apart maybe 3 weeks or so. I had been hounding him to at the very least flirt with me because I was feeling very lonely and wanted to feel his interest in me (That sounds far dirtier than I intended.). He swore that he would take some time to talk to me and I asked if he could help me pick out a toy or something to keep me from completely raging out at him about all my pent up frustration. Last night he obliged and we had a discussion that went far more in depth than I expected. I'm fucking exuberant over this shit. Trying to reign back the excitement, though. Just in case.

I started by saying that I wanted to talk about the whole lack of interest in sex while in a relationship thing ... and I wasn't met by the usual groans and contention!!! I asked if he had sex more frequently while single, because I was pretty sure that was the case. Yes, he said, but he said he didn't know why and he wanted to fix things. I told him that it was likely because he found sex with new partners exciting and monogamy just didn't do that for him and he confirmed this was the case. There is nothing wrong with that. We talked about how sex and emotions often don't correlate with our logical ideals. I told him that I didn't understand why he would let something he found gratifying slip away in favor of abstinence. He, of course, said that he cared about me and wouldn't want to do anything that might jeopardize our relationship. I get that, but satisfying his sexual needs and having a happy relationship don't have to be mutually exclusive. He voiced concerns over me being with other men and I told him that wasn't what I wanted. What I wanted was for him to have a sex drive and that the lack thereof was just as toxic to our relationship as potential mishaps. 

Basically, we laid the groundwork for further discussion about opening our relationship to other women. When we first got together I tried to convey to him that I was okay with this ... I just had an instinct that told me where we were heading. I wanted to make sure we were taken care of, but he's a bit over emotional at times and that overshadowed his ability to have a composed, rational discussion about the matter. Anyway, looks like we have a way to possibly make this work. At the rate we have been going I won't be able to deal with no sex for the amount of time we'd like to spend together.

But now that I have to live in a state of near constant horniness, I resent her. I truly love this girl, and she was a goddamn mess before she met me, but how much happiness do I have to trade? Would I be a terrible person for leaving? Her self esteem is almost zero around anyone else, she has few friends, and serious problems with her family. I'd be abandoning her to all that.

I continually discussed with her how sex is important to me because I love that intimate connection with her. One thing I mentioned is that I am the luckiest person in the world because I am the only one who can be that intimate with her. (Nothing wrong with some truthful flattery.) 

Eventually our conversation led to the discovery that sex seemed like too much work for her. It took me too long to have an orgasm which required a lot of work for her. We compromised and I agreed not to use the vibrator anymore (I was using it almost everyday). I also agreed that sex once a week is okay with me, and we do it on the weekends so she won't be too tired. She also agreed that our sex will be ""real"" sex and not just ""here is an orgasm"" sex. 

So far we have been doing this for a month and it has been successful. Because my amount of orgasming went down from at least seven a week to one, basically all she has to do is look at me and I am gone. On Fridays, I always mention (only once so as to not pressure her) that I am glad the weekend is here so we can be intimate. I also make it clear that I am very happy with the situation and I always let her initiate. She also mentions to me when she is planning on initiating. (Usually Sunday evening because I think she likes to put it off as much as possible.)

She claims that she doesn't like her body anymore, yet she weighs less than before she got pregnant. Any advance or hidden message of sex pushes her even farther away. I've had a huge talk with her and she just says how much she loves our new baby and our home life and if i have a problem with it than i'm the problem and should take care of it. I'm currently trying to give her space, which results with me drinking and taking Ativan to keep from acting stupid but every day that passes i'm getting more and more tired of pretending i'm happy and content and everything is fine. I love her to death and want to fix this with every fiber in me, i'm very selfless at heart it just gets so hard to deny these deep needs within myself. Do i even have the right to be upset or frustrated? Is 5 months not long enough to start wanting at least a little sex? A little taste of the girl I got engaged to?

In the past 8 months I’ve experienced a huge decrease in libido.  I don’t feel like having sex except maybe once every week/2weeks.  I don’t feel like having sex with my SO/anyone/myself for that matter.  It’s not that my SO is not attractive, in fact he’s the only one I am attracted to, whether it is when we go to bars and other guys hit on me, or I see male models in magazine ads, I always compare them to my SO and just think that he is so much more handsome.  He also always tries to make me feel beautiful and communicates to me how very attracted he is to me, constantly complimenting me on my looks and body even when I’m in sweatpants with no makeup on.  I know he’s extremely attracted to me and I him but when it comes to initiating sex I just freeze up.  When we kiss in the back of my head I’m constantly wondering if it’s going to lead to sex, or when I come over if he’s expecting to have sex with me; that when some sort of contact happens and we start wandering with our hands, I tense up and a million thoughts race through my head.  Obviously this takes me out of the moment and my SO can feel me tensing up and the hesitation in my actions and this hurts his feelings immensely and it will often lead to an heated argument and him/me feeling like shit. 

We’ve discussed this many times, the impact it’s having on him, our relationship, the importance of sex and everything.  I get that sex is essential to all relationships and this is messing with his head and self-esteem on a whole new level; for example he’s extremely insecure now.  He feels like he turns me off, I’m not attracted to him and that someone is going to steal me away.  Complicating matters is that I used to be borderline nympho in the first 6 months of the relationship.  We had an extremely passionate relationship emotionally and sexually, where we’d have sex 3 times a day almost every time we saw each other, and both initiate equally.  I am at a point where I realize that I am the problem, that I cannot keep hurting him but I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  We’ve tried discussing various solutions, maybe I need more space; I got more space, that didn’t work.  Maybe I’m depressed; I’ve started feeling better recently and my self-esteem has improved a bit, that didn’t work either.  I feel no desire to have sex, when we start having sex and during the act of sex, sure, it feels good and I like it but I’m hesitant to start and I never initiate.  

I feel like something psychological is messing with me and my desire but I can’t pinpoint what it is or how to fix it.  I have tried working myself up to it; fantasizing about him in the middle of the day (Like I used to) and telling myself how good sex feels etc. but when it comes to the actual act and he starts to touch my all over my body and our kisses get more passionate, thoughts run through my head like: Do I want this? Am I up to this? Should I respond to this or cut it off early so he doesn't get his hopes up?

I was hoping that someone here could help give some insight or share their experiences.

While I think it is a mistake to compare other people's lives to my own, I find myself wondering if our situation is normal. Sex during the week is pretty much never going to happen. Weekends are a crap-shoot.  If we fool around once in a week, it was a good week.  

None of it makes sense to me.  I am a decent guy, I dote over my wife probably more than I should. She seems to think ""you're so handsome"" is somehow going to make me feel better. I've stopped talking to her about the sex thing because it becomes an argument every time.   But, she knows that it bothers me.  She says that she wants ""to be woo'd"" but I have no idea how to do that. It is not out of the ordinary for me to make a nice dinner, get her champagne and have a night to ourselves. I don't think she even sees it as effort going in. I pretty much do everything around the house as it is/tell her she looks nice literally every morning.

I can't talk to her about it because she either gets embarrassed or I get frustrated.  ""Just letting things happen,"" seems to be what she wants, but they don't happen. For example, I'm not supposed to mention positions because if she wants to do that, then she'll do it. We went an actual year, a full year, of the same thing and only that. In college I complained once about bjs, and she said the same type of thing. It's been 7 years.

The problem I'm having now is that I'm becoming depressed and a little resentful. I love my wife, she's an amazing person, but my frustration about this aspect of our life is spilling into others. I have no idea what to do. I have a hot, young wife that I fantasize about literally constantly. Am I being a whiny pain in the ass? Is sex 2-3 times a month normal?

At the same time, he says that if he didn't have his medical condition he would gladly be a vegetarian with me (confusing, I know.) He thinks that if he eats more meat it will help his libido, which I agree with.

I generally cook for the two of us. I know vegetarians are known for having a ""holier than thou"" attitude, but it is a lifestyle choice that is very important to me. He knows this. I have tried cooking fish and chicken occasionally, but he says it's not enough. I have told him if he wants to eat more meat he can go right ahead and cook himself some, but he says it's not just about his LD and health. It's about eating it WITH ME and sharing the experience of eating together and not having to eat separate meals.

Basically the two compromises I can think of do not offer him the experience of eating together-He can either eat meat occasionally with me when I cook, or he can eat however much meat he wants if he cooks himself. Am I not making a big enough sacrifice?

**Edit 2:** TL;DR: Chronic stress, health problems, and a kid. It's been a long slide down and a struggle to come back from.

**Edit 2:** I included a lot of detail, because writing it out was therapeutic for me. Thank you for reading!

Apologies in advance, this will probably be long.

About 4 years ago, my wife and I got embroiled in a lawsuit involving our home. It took about 2 years to resolve, but during the time we had a lot of stress and unhappiness as a result. The house was later declared uninhabitable by the court, though we'd been forced to live in it in that state due to the ongoing lawsuit and finances.

During this time, my health declined due to poor sleep and chronic stress. I gained weight, couldn't sleep, had no energy, was depressed, and got sick a lot. While I was not diagnosed, my symptoms would have pointed at adrenal fatigue. My doctor and I tried antidepressants, which didn't help. Instead I self medicated with too much video games and junk food. I'm about 6'1"", and weighed around 195 lbs, and not in a good way.

My wife also gained weight during this period, but had other problems. Toward the end of our lawsuit ordeal, she was diagnosed with an autoimmune form of hypothyroidism and celiac disease. She began treatment for her thyroid and started feeling better almost immediately.

Throughout all of this, our sex life was adequate. Events had impacted both of our libidos, and my wife was pretty GGG about things even when she wasn't in the mood. (Oral, HJs, or even just kissing or sticking her tits in my face while I jerked off, etc. *Mmm, boobs.*)

Just a few months after starting her treatment, we found out that she was pregnant. We'd been trying for almost 2 years, and practically given up on it. Her thyroid had probably been off the entire time, and finally getting that sorted out was all that we needed.

Over the new few months, we won our lawsuit and moved out of the house so that it could be repaired. Repairs took almost 5 months to complete. In the meantime we were living in a rented home with complications of its own. (The roof there leaked among other problems, which led to even more legal conflicts since the property management company refused to fix it. I was on very familiar terms with my lawyer.)

Sometime during all this, I took a look in the mirror and didn't like what I saw. I changed my diet and lost about 30lbs, and then gained about 5 lbs in muscle. I looked better (though perhaps a little too thin) and felt way better. My skin tone darkened (I had developed a palor) and my weight stabilized around 170 lbs. My libido started coming back, but unfortunately my wife's was not there at all. We probably had sex about once every 3 weeks for the majority of the pregnancy, and maybe only once during the third trimester. She was much less GGG and would either act annoyed or pissed off if I tried to start any intimacy, or just push me away.

The repairs to our house were complete, but we decided to sell it rather than move back in. It had been the focal point of too much stress, and there were more things wrong with it which  we knew would cause problems in the future. (It was very poorly built.) The sale closed within days of our child being born.

Over the next few months, there was zero intimacy. My wife didn't even want me to touch her while we sleeping, or even snuggle on the couch. The new baby completely dominated her time and her body. I did all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, and chores. I basically had a really bad roommate rather than a spouse. Some of this is understandable, what with a new baby and all, but the degree to which I was shut out was extreme.

We moved (again!) just a few months later. Things got a little worse in our relationship but didn't really change. I don't think we had sex for the next 9 months or so.

I had occasional on-call shifts for work that went from 11am to 2am the next day. Since the baby slept in our room (in our bed, between us) and I didn't want the pager to wake her if/when it went off, I would either stay up until my shift ended or try to sleep on the couch. This led to me missing sleep and getting sick again. I lost the little bit of muscle I'd gained, and even though I'd been lifting weights since I'd initially gotten back in shape, I was getting weaker and my weight was back down to ~ 160 lbs. I would invariably catch a cold coming off every on-call shift, which would lay me up for 5-7 days.

My libido had tanked (again) and I was having trouble maintaining an erection. Attempting masturbation was just depressing. I was waking up 4-5 times a night to pee. My performance at work sucked, I was sick all the time, tired, depressed, couldn't sleep and losing weight. ([Wikipedia on hypogonadism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism#Symptoms)) I found a new doctor who diagnosed me with hypogonadism, or low testosterone. I started treatment and was feeling better in short order.

Sex life was still dead during this period. I think we may have been up to every 6-8 weeks, and the sex was not good. (TMI: My wife is petite, and I am not. Things don't fit properly unless she's into it.) No matter what I'd try (and I tried basically everything!) she was not getting aroused, and just wanted me to get it over with. Hot. At least masturbation was enjoyable again, though my wife didn't want anything to do with me. I was emotionally dead.

I was gaining weight and getting stronger again. Amazing how anabolic steroids will do that. I was up to maybe 175 lbs, and I felt better physically.

Shortly after our kid's first birthday we bought a new home and moved (again!). After moving in, we settled into a bit of a routine: I'd get up at 6am, go to the gym, then work, then go shopping, come home, cook dinner, clean, give the kid a bath and put her to bed, then get my bags packed for the next day. My wife would get up with the baby, then either take her to Gymboree (or similar toddler activity) or play Facebook games all day while the baby played, then when she would go to bed my wife would sleep on an air mattress in her room. We had a nanny who would come 2-3 times a week for a few hours so that my wife could (in theory) be able to take care of anything she wanted to do (such as go to the gym, whatever) without needing to worry about the baby. I would occasionally have to order my wife to do self-care type of activities, like shower every day or eat.

At least I had the entire bed to myself.

After a few months, I'd had it and I told her that she needed to start doing something to help around the house. At a bare minimum, change the cat litter daily and take care of the dishes. When she came into my bedroom (because really, I was the only one who slept in the master bedroom at this point) the next morning, she was upset and started threatening divorce. (I'd say this is the low point of things.) We talked a little more, and I got her to agree to counselling first.

I set up appointments with a couples counselor and asked my wife to set up childcare during that time. She didn't, so we had to take the kid to our first appointment. Since it was mostly an introduction, it wasn't a big deal but the therapist told us in no uncertain terms that we needed to have a babysitter.

For the next two appointments, she did not get a babysitter. I went alone to one, she went alone to the next.

Somewhere around this time, we had sex. Probably the first time in 6 weeks. We had been pretty lax on birth control since my wife's period hadn't started up again and because a side effect of testosterone replacement is sterility. Well, that was a mistake because my wife got pregnant. (yeah, we all saw that coming.) I don't remember what I said when she told me, but I it was along the lines of ""What do you want to do about it?"". I knew, of course, that having another kid would be a horrible idea (see: everything written above). While I never said that we should end the pregnancy, I was definitely focused on the downsides of having more children. At the same time, I admitted that we could afford it, and that there weren't any reasons (other than the tattered remnants of our marriage) why we couldn't have more kids. We ended the conversation with a plan to get her to her endocrinologist to get her thyroid meds adjusted and to think and talk more about what we should do.

Around this time, I had stopped responding to the testosterone replacement I was using and started getting sick again. Stress probably had a lot to do with it.

We had a counselling session the next day (or maybe day after) and actually had a babysitter. When we brought up the pregnancy the therapist was pretty floored. She also brought up that this might not be the best time to have another kid, but that if we wanted to keep it we'd have to work really, really hard to repair our relationship. She also suggested that my wife begin seeing a therapist on her own.

The next day my wife told me that she was going to schedule an abortion and file for divorce. She cancelled the appointment with her endocrinologist. I managed to talk her off the ledge, because we still had time to decide and needed to make a rational and less emotional decision. I decided to myself that I'd have to be OK with her choice, but realized that I would never be happy again. I started doing calculations to see how much life insurance would pay out if ""something"" were to happen to me, and what it would take to pay off the house and fund education for two kids. (Actually, this is probably the low point.)

By the end of the week, before we had made a decision, my wife miscarried. I was hugely relieved, but was sensitive enough to try not to show it. My wife blamed herself for having cancelled her endo appointment. I found out later that she was suicidal during this time. She did start seeing a therapist, one who specialized in post-partum depression and post-partum anxiety. The therapist recommended that my wife begin medication to treat her anxiety and after some contemplation, she did.

It's been a few months now, and the difference is incredible. One of the most welcome changes has been in our kid - her separation anxiety is almost completely gone.

I’m continuing to see the couples counsellor on my own while my wife is seeing her therapist.

I changed my TRT method and finally got my own hormones sorted have put a little more weight on again, and have gotten stronger. I’m right around 180 lbs. and still lean. *Yay anabolics!*

Sex is still not as frequent as I’d like, but it happens more than it has in years. Now that my wife has some interest in sex again, I want to make sure that she’s enjoying herself. This is giving me performance anxiety, and I still have a lot of resentment toward my wife due to the rejection that I dealt with for so long.

A while back, I can't remember how long exactly maybe a week ago, I lost it.  It had been at least two weeks since we had sex.  I have been married for not quite thirteen years, and have 4 kids.  I have a HL, and my wife has a LL.  It didn't start out that way, but I digress.  We had gone to bed, and I was drifting off when I heard her vibrator kick on.  I am obviously aware of what is happening immediately.  I ask her (rhetorically) what she was doing.  She says she couldn't sleep and wanted to have an orgasm.  

I know under normal circumstances that isn't a big deal, but let me explain the backstory for you.  We have been up and down on trying to meet in the middle.  We had a few months ago reached an understanding that if someone was really just not in the mood that it was perfectly fine to say no.  Ok, right?  Well, since Christmas we have had sex, maybe 5 times.  I am a, bare minimum, once every three days person.  The spoken agreement was that if I needed it, I could just tell her.  Well shit hasn't been so good for a lot of different reasons.  I have gotten shut down again and again, so I was getting pretty hurt about it.

So she waited until she thought I would be asleep to do her business.  That got me.  What really got me was that she knew that I was desperate, didn't invite me to join, just kept on going.  So I am laying there dying inside.  She gets closer and closer, and I finally have enough, and get out of bed and leave the room.  She keeps going and finishes.  She never speaks of it, I have been on the couch because I can't even speak or look at her most of the time.  She has had seemingly no problems with this.  She goes to bed, and I avoid her at all costs.  The agreement was her idea, and I conceded because it was the best I felt I was going to get.  

I wrote her a letter, but she hasn't seen it.  I wish I could revise it, but it has been sent.  I have severe PTSD, am a retired disabled veteran of 32 years of age.  I was in the Army, and made a lot of money.  Well 7 combat deployments, IED's, firefights, death, never brought me down this much because it was all so surreal really.  Don't get me wrong I know I have some issues, but I try really fucking hard everyday to keep going.  I don't have any friends anymore, I just can't stand to keep in contact with my old buddies, and where we moved, there isn't anything here, and we are broke.  

I can't reconcile this.  I can go anywhere and not have sex with someone.  I have no support from her, she just bitches at me because now that I am disabled and can't work that if my VA rating goes from 90 up to 100 once I tell the VA about my walking problems that I won't be able to work.  Then we won't have enough money, so I avoid going to the VA, because out of the fear of them having to treat me for my injuries and I will have to submit new medical data.  Then we will only get my disability.  She doesn't work, she used to do nursing, then work in a financial planning place.  She ~~is~~ was doing online courses to get ... something.  I know that my family only tolerates her because of me and the kids, she is typically an internet knowitall bitch.  She knows this and even gets teased for it.  

Regardless, I have gone through so many dry spells, and I get really depressed and shitty without sex.  Deployments are different, she isn't there, I know it can't happen.  But when she is there and it doesn't, well hell, what am I supposed to think.  She will undoubtedly see this, because she snoops on everything.  She is very insecure/nosy.  She actually told my mother that she follows my reddit posts.  Since I have nothing to hide, I never really cared.  I just can't take feeling like this anymore.  I fucking despise being lonely, but I can't remember what it was like to be single.  I married young, and quickly.  We went pretty strong, but like I said, I was in a stable(paying) job.  We lived all over the world, and had good times and bad times.  My family said that whatever I need, they are there, but what about my kids.  I am tearing up even thinking about it.  I can't be without my kids.  

So, I am open to any non troll advice, anything at all.  I know that if she won't talk to me, then I breach the subject, but I can't.  I am going to the VA rep to set up counseling/therapy next week.  I have pretty much given up.  I don't want to talk to her, I just want to remain indignant, and not be around her.  Yes I have read what I wrote, and yes I see it too.  So spit your hard truths at me, if bombs and guns haven't killed me, your words won't either.  

Reddit, I just need a ray of light here.  I am not the type of guy to open up like this.  Not at all.

At the time the sex was great, and my wife experienced an orgasm with me for the first time.  Hell, we discovered together that she was a squirter.  So after three years of marriage, the sex tapered off to being non-existent.  Then one night after a year of being sexless, my wife confessed that she was having dreams that involved her being with other women.  At first I blew it off saying that having homo-erotic dreams was nothing abnormal.  A few months later she told me that she was pretty sure she was bi-sexual after I caught her having an online romance with another woman.  We did counseling for awhile, and she lived in the guest bedroom.  At this point we were roommates.  No one ever figured out the issues that we were having behind closed doors.  One day we were eating dinner, and we both opened up that we knew it was time to move on.  My wife knew she was a lesbian, and there was no way the marriage could work.  I admitted that I needed intimacy out of a relationship, and not to fake appearances.  I was embarrassed to admit that my now ex-wife was (and is gay).  But I moved on, and I have found someone new.  My girlfriend is awesome and we have the type of intimacy that I missed in my previous marriage.  So if there is anything to take away from this story it is this:

&gt;In retaliation for making her have ""the talk"" over the years, she's restricted, by decree, the variability allowed in, and frequency of, our sex life. For instance, I'm pretty much not allowed to touch her in certain ways, at certain times, or expected to initiate. *I'm also given a very prescribed sequence of events required to ""turn her on"" if she does acquiesce to being touched.*

Ah yes, this is what I used to call ""the cheat code to Ms.Salkmonkey's Desire Mode."" 

Instead up hitting Up Down Up Down A B Left Left A B on the controller, here were my instructions, which I gathered over the years, mostly from violating them:

1. Never after sundown. Heck, never after noon.
2. Never on a week day morning.
3. Rub her back, but not in any perceivable pattern.
4. Don't try to touch a breast or butt or other erogenous zone unless and until she gives *the sign* that she is ready for me to proceed.
5. *the sign* will not be defined or discussed or acknowleged, but he shall know it when he sees/hears it (except I almost never did, or I mis-interpreted it).
6. Do not assume that, once the breast is engaged, that the crotch is an approved area.
7. Do not let one's erection touch the butt unless and until the female crotch has been engaged and adequately attended to.
8. Do not expect her to actually touch the penis.
9. Do not attempt anything fancy - there shall be only two approved positions: missionary and her on top.
10. DO NOT - UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - Change positions after insertion has been achieved. She is NOT some kind of whore.
11. Do not expect any help whatsoever with the act of insertion - see Rule 8.
12. Once insertion has been achieved, do not vary one's rhythm. 104 beats per minute - no more, no less. For purposes of calibration, ""Stayin' Alive"" by the Bee Gees is the proper rhythm.  Do NOT sing it out loud.
13. And...you're done. Roll off quickly if you're on top. She will disengage quickly if she's on top and go directly to the bathroom to clean up. 
14. There's lots of tasks to be completed around the house, so, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get busy.

Of course, not having sex for weeks or months, and then having it in one position with no change in the rhythm - well, that's a recipe for an unsatisfactory experience for all.

That unsatisfactory experience led to anxiety issues which were not helped by her unwillingness to touch the penis or help with its insertion, which led to even more unsatisfactory experiences.

That's why there are no more attempts at ""the talk"" and why there has been no sex for about two years.  I actually thought I was horrible at sex, even though I remembered that in previous relationships, I had never thought it was a problem. ""Must be age,"" I told myself. I'm in my 50s.

Then, I strayed. (Save the story for another time, or maybe it's not even appropriate for this sub). The other woman was about the same age as my wife. There were, however, no rules.  There was anxiety, for sure. But she was patient and kind and made me feel sexy again and the anxiety was gone in the first 15 minutes.  I actually surprised myself (and her) with my stamina and my energy and my creativity.  

When I got back to my Dead Bedroom, I found it was all a lot easier to deal with, knowing that I was not going to have to follow my wife's rulebook that prescribed a pathway to disappointment any more.  I am still fond of her, but I'm no longer burdened by remembering which rules to follow and when.  Instead, I lie in bed and think about the last time I was with my lover, wonder when I'll be with her again, and drift off easily into sleep.

TL;DR - I used to have to follow a very prescribed sequence to turn her on, but now, I don't bother - and I get to sleep much easier.

It didn't :D

Much cuddling before, after, and all throughout the day made the day even better. Her nibbling my ear to distract me from an errant playful slap to an allergic spot made it better still. But the kicker was this: as she was getting in bed for the night, she was complaining about soreness in a sensitive spot. With all the flirt I could muster, I offered to kiss it and make it feel better. She said ""No, because I know you won't behave."" (She's gotta go to sleep, after all.)

And so, my anger is gone. My wife likes me better for the lack of anger. She has no idea that my anger is gone because I'm in bed with another woman; but she is happier that I am not acting out of the anger of no sex.

She would be devastated if she knew I cheated; but her life experience is better that her partner is not seeking sex; not angry for her lack of desire.

Perhaps I should divorce her. My peace with cheating is uneasy at best and divorcing her would let me live my life honestly.

1348203196.0,21,self.DeadBedrooms,108gfp,The perils of co-habitation,29,8,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/108gfp/the_perils_of_cohabitation/,"One type of pattern I’ve been seeing lately in posts is how the sex slows down after moving in together. You’d think the opposite, right? Being in the same quarters you can have sex anytime you wanted to. Simply inhabiting the same space is not a guarantee for sex, as many of us are finding out the hard way. I’m no expert, but in my experiences and things I’ve observed, there are some of the issues that can contribute to a dead co-habited bedroom.

**Lack of effort** - Remember when you didn’t live together, and you had to plan to see each other? On a night you were to meet, you probably took care to make yourself look snazzy – shaved the appropriate areas, wore something nice, put on a nice scent, etc. Are you doing the same now that you live together? Granted, you can’t really dress for a night out every day, but make sure you aren’t falling into a pattern of laziness when it comes to your presentability. Much of this may be more psychological than visual – perhaps TMI, but my wife stopped shaving her armpits and legs. Getting turned off by hairy pits is one thing, but it subtly sends me the message that she no longer cares. Especially since I remember during our dating period that she mentioned going to have the hair removed, and would sometimes be self-conscious of it if she felt a few strands were coming in. 

Additionally, lack of effort also covers a lack of trying to seduce your partner. You may just think “I’m horny...let’s do it!” but the build up and seduction process that leads to sex can also be important. For low-libido partners, it tends to be essential. Seduction can take many forms – of course physical in the form of foreplay and physical touch. It can also be mental – how you make that person feel. Remember back to the dating stages – before anything physical starts to take place, you have to accept that person on a psychological level first. In a long-term relationship or co-habitation situation, we sometimes take this for granted. 

**Losing the thrill** - When you lived apart, you looked forward to meeting each other. It naturally creates feelings of anticipation and nervousness. These are powerful emotions that can serve as a great spark to a low or responsive libido partner. Now you live together, and that feeling of anticipation is gone – after all, you see each other every day. Even if your schedules don’t line up, you know at least your partner is within reach. Effectively the spark is gone. Finding a way to re-create the feeling of anticipation and something to look forward to could be key in making sure you two don’t fall into a rut. Essentially, you have to figure out a way to date your partner, even though you both live together.

**Single-lifestyle habits** - Living together is more than just sharing a space – you have to change your lifestyle to take the other person into account. A lot of people, yours truly included, can sometimes forget this. You have some down time in the evening, so it’s time to jump on the computer, or play your favorite video game, or read a book, or watch TV, etc. All things you do easily and regularly when single. But what about the other person in the house with you? You will want to have times where you both are free to do your own thing and enjoy your personal interests. But you both must take care to avoid letting those get in the way of interacting with your partner. I hate to admit this, but despite me being the HL partner, in the early stages of our co-habitation I did miss opportunities for sex with my wife simply because I spent a little too much time on the internet or watching TV. 

**Bringing baggage home** - The nice thing about home is that it’s our sanctuary. When the world is raining on your head, it’s the one place where you can kick off your shoes and not worrying about keeping up appearances. You can be frustrated or gloomy or angry or whatever. That’s good and all, but now we have a partner who might be affected by our bad moods. As I said before, I’m HL, but on days where my wife was in a fowl mood even if she asked me for sex I wouldn’t really be interested. Someone who is frustrated, irritated, angry, etc, isn’t really someone who is sexy. Again, this is something I’m guilty of – my wife has told me that even if she thought she wanted sex, it was difficult to approach me when I came home looking exhausted and defeated by life. In some cases this caused a dead-bedroom circle - anticipating no sex I'd come home rather flat and apathetic - seeing me in that state, my wife who may have been receptive to sex is then turned off. Sexiness is very much a state of mind, so try to leave negative feelings at the door. The more upbeat and energetic you are at home, the more likely your partner will be in responding to you.

**No joy of the hunt** - One aspect of sex is accomplishment – that a member of the opposite sex finds you attractive and desirable. It’s very much like validation. And as such, we don’t like it to be too easy. There’s no joy in getting the participation award for just showing up. So, as silly as this sounds/is, sometimes making sex too available to your partner can turn them off. I notice this more often in men, who usually take on the “hunter” role in the sexual dynamic. But I think it can and does apply to women as well. Essentially the more available you make yourself to your partner, the less inclined they are to want you. Does this mean you have to start metering out your sex? Not necessarily. But it can help to find a way to make your partner feel like you desire them specifically, and not just that you’re horny and want to get off.

Again, I’m by no means an expert here as I’m still working on my own DB. Plus I figure a lot of this does not apply to many of us DB veterans, or those dating a person with a true low-libido. As I said I’ve noticed lately a few posts about sex slowing down after moving in, and in my experiences these are some issues that contribute to the situation. Some or none may apply, or it may apply more to your partner than you. Hopefully this can help to identify some of the issues you face so you’ll know where to start in solving them.

There were a variety of reasons, but here are the main ones.

* I was stressed beyond belief with a new business.  Rather than cut me some slack or offering to help (without lecturing or telling me what to do), my ex pressured me for more sex, harassing me well into the night.  As in, 3am or later.  Every night.  It got to the point that I wouldn't even come to bed until I knew he was asleep - and then he started waking up when I snuck into bed, and starting the fight then!  I had to be at the store for 7:30am every morning, so as you can imagine, this made me extremely tired and short-tempered, and even less likely to have sex with him.  Or anyone, for that matter!

* I went on Nuvaring, and immediately lost most of my libido.  I went off of it almost as immediately, but it took several months to get back on track.  In that time my ex refused to believe that there was a medical reason - because HE hadn't ever experienced anything like that.  His attitude shut off what very low desire I had, and after the libido appeared to resume (I regained attraction to men, etc..) I had no desire to be with my ex - attitude counts!

* In December 2010 I fell off my horse.  This resulted in a broken hip - yay me!  I wasn't able to physically do much more than shuffle walk, and was lucky my mobility allowed that much movement - I was ordered out of most physical activity for six months.  My ex was frustrated that I wasn't interested in sex - because, you know, a hip isn't a part that *might* get in the way - and actually said these words:  ""You could at least give me a blowjob.""  Like the break was something I did deliberately to get out of sex.  And that was the final nail in the coffin, as it were.  We didn't have sex again for the rest of the relationship (another year - because I'm unbelievably stupid).

* My ex was lazy.  He did nothing around the house, yet felt entitled to lecture me on how things were done.  My ex also decided that partying all night was more important than working and paying the bills.

* While he was out partying (and likely cheating constantly - I'm not that stupid), he constantly accused me of cheating on him.  He was even jealous of my horse - because I would go out and spend a couple of hours at the barn a few nights a week.  His jealousy was a total turn off.

I used sex as a weapon against my ex, which I know is wrong.  I should have just broken up with him.  However, I was not the one at 100% fault.  Ladies and gents, if your partner suddenly has less interest in sex, or life in general, don't pressure them for sex.  Don't harass them into the night and make them dread the thought of going to bed with you.  Do things around the house to make them feel appreciated, and to help them feel less stress.  Don't lecture or demand, don't act like a fool.  ANd definitely don't accuse them of cheating because ""you gotta be getting it SOMEWHERE"".

Had my ex LISTENED when I told him to give me a break, or helped relieve some of the stress, or had compassion for the fact that I was physically unable to have sex for a finite amount of time, our sex life would have been different, and maybe that would have changed the tone of our entire relationship.

While there are certainly situations where both partners communicate and work hard to overcome a difference in sex drive, it seems much more common on this reddit to have the low-drive partner not care at all about his/her partner's wishes and happiness.

It takes two to make this happen, of course; that requires a high-drive partner willing to stay in such a relationship. Working out a sexual incompatibility is one thing, but it's something much worse when your partner won't listen, care, or make any effort to change or improve the relationship. That situation seems more like an abusive relationship, and it makes me wonder why anyone would stay in it.

My thoughts on this are that, like any victim in an abusive relationship, people stay in it because they don't think they deserve better, aren't worth enough, feel bad and selfish for taking care of themselves, or feel like their own needs don't matter. Given society's collective dysfunction concerning sex, and the general sex-negativity throughout this culture, when the needs are sexual, it can be even harder for people to stand up for themselves.

It has been going very well, and I would like to update since it's relevant and I sincerely hope it will give you hope and the courage to speak up about your desires to your partners.

Three months in, we have settled into a reasonable comfortableness with my playing with the lover and the long term partner has really opened up around sex, it is like a blossoming of his sexual nature.  He's lost 30 pounds and is chatting up women in the grocery aisles just to play around and increase his confidence, seriously wants to play with others and me, is pretty comfortable with me seeing the FWB once a week or so and....Drumroll please...

We are having sex more than once a week.

His physical issues have lessened; the more we have sex, the more sex he is able to have, the more sex we are able to have the better he feels about himself, the better he feels about himself the less he is jealous.  He has asked for tips, things I enjoy with the FWB that he doesn't do, says he wants to become a better lover for me, but mostly for himself!  He seriously wants to 3some me with another man.  He wants to play with another woman.  Wants us to play with another couple.  He wants to stay with me, play with me, try to work it out in a new way.

All of this is positive IMO, I'm so happy and suprised at the way it's turned out.  I would not say we are 'out of the woods' yet, it could still go wrong.  But he has done an astonishing job of turning around, overall, and being accepting of my desires and not too fussed about me getting some of them fulfilled outside the relationship. I have done OK at being accepting of his desires as well, trying to meet them myself as much as possible but I don't feel fussed about him playing around to fill other needs that I can't.

hugely different sex drives. [Xpost from /r/
relationships]",23,3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/r7upx/boyfriend_seems_unwilling_to_compromise_on_our/,"Hey, reddit. Obvious throwaway is obvious.

I’m female and 23. He’s 34. We’ve been together for about 2 years and cohab for about six months. I’ve had about twenty sexual partners. He’d had about three or four including myself. His first sexual partner was at 28.

We recently moved to another city so that we could find work. Success! I was able to get my first job after a year or more of searching and he’s making twice what he used to. Our issue with sex didn’t really come up until we moved in together. Before then, we saw each other about once a week so it wasn’t evident.

When we first got to this city we were able to stay with his step-brother, Y, and step-brother’s fiancée, X. We are both really appreciative that X and Y were willing to let us stay for the 6 weeks that we did. However, Y seemed a bit resentful that we, two complete strangers, were staying in her house without paying rent. We tried to be as helpful and cooperative as possible around the house. The boyfriend wasn’t willing to have sex while they were at home for fear of annoying her. So I tried initiating sex on the few times that we did have the house to ourselves. I was successful about half the time. The rest of the time he was too tired, or had been drinking, or watching football, or whatever else. He didn’t initiate sex at all.

I was excited when we started renting an apartment of our own. “Finally!” I thought, “we don’t have to care about another couples’ schedules or whether they hear us”. We started having sex about once or twice a week, again, after I made the first moves. However, our sessions were always two-minute jackhammers without any foreplay on his part. I was more than enthusiastic with providing blowjobs, kissing, touching, and other fun stuff. It just wasn’t reciprocated. Since this was the only kind of sex we were having I began to feel used. It seemed to me as though he was just using me to get off.

I brought this up with him and he confessed that he was only having sex because I wanted to and that the sooner he finished, the sooner I would leave him alone. I was very hurt by that. First, because I was left very unsatisfied every time we did have sex and would only want it again sooner. Second, because I felt as though I had somehow manipulated him into have sex whenever I wanted to. Third, I really didn’t appreciate how dishonest it seemed. When I told him how I felt he apologized said that he only really wanted sex once a month or so. I said that I’d be happy with sex once or twice a week, and we agreed to compromise.

Weeks later, he began to “forget” when we’d had sex last. It would persist for a few weeks at a time. This stressed me out and, when confronted, he admitted that he didn’t care if he didn’t have sex. He has said in one of our recent talks that, in his past reading of stories with ""frigid"" female characters, he has identified with them. I suggested that we start opening up our relationship. I said that I’d like to sleep with other people since I missed the physical aspects and I wasn’t getting it. He responded by saying that there would be jealousy issues since I’d be having sex with people that weren’t him. He also said that if I wanted that, he wanted to seek out other women “so that we could both get what we wanted”. What. But he said that he didn’t care about sex, and I wasn’t getting it from him anyway! What was there to be jealous about?

Another example of his excuses about lack of sex include turning me down on the last day (also the lightest) of my period because he didn’t want to make a mess. This happened after I told him a few days earlier that I put a towel under the fitted sheet of the bed so there would be no stains. Another time, we were having ourselves a bit of foreplay and I was giving him head and then rubbing his shoulders and kissing his neck. He froze up completely because he “thought I didn’t want to have sex because I stopped sucking him off a couple of minutes ago” and that CLEARLY shows a lack of interest!

We later discussed the possibility of going to see a counselor, and have since agreed that it would be a good idea. I have been the only one to look up the ones in our city and am the only one that brings it up in discussion any more. I’m beginning to think that he considers our lack of sex life as “my” problem, not “our” problem and that I’m the only one responsible to bring up solutions since this doesn’t seem to affect him. I never cared that he masturbates until recently. I’ve offered to help him out and get him off but I’ve never been taken up on the offer. It’s starting to annoy me that he’ll masturbate in private and then make excuses about lack of sex.

I have long lost the willingness to initiate sex because I’m so tired and sad from being turned down most, if not all, of the time. I’ve started having sexydreams about people that I’ve met once or twice. I don’t really feel guilty about it – I don’t think I’d ever act on them but hell, I’d probably have a better chance of getting laid by a complete stranger than the person I love most in this world. Ugh.

It feels a little better just to vent about it. Moving to another city has eliminated most of the people that I can openly talk about this to.

I am a 56 year old LL woman married to a 52 year old HL man. We are about to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary next week. Sex was good during the 2 years we dated and the 1st year of our marriage. Then I stared trying to get pregnant and infertility reared his ugly head. Sex became a chore and just created more stress. We struggled for years through medical treatments but the end result was that I could not conceive. This was very devastating to me. The fact that I cannot have children will stay with me forever. My husband was OK with it.  We then moved on but the sex that followed was never frequent enough for my husband and not always that satisfying. We had our share of arguments but he often would shut down and would not express his feelings. It got so bad that we agreed to try marriage counseling quite a # of years ago. The psychologist was not very good but it got my husband talking about his feelings and we were able to have really good discussions at a local restaurant each week after the sessions. We did talk about plenty of issues with the doctor but not about our sex life. I think it was just too uncomfortable to talk about. Things seemed to get better but then we settled into the same routine. Early menopause then started which brought on more issues such as mood swings and vaginal dryness and  low libido.
 
My husband is not happy about the quantity and quality of our sex life and intimacy, however, rather than try to do something about it as other bloggers said that they do, he does the opposite. He takes out his frustration on me by treating me badly. He is moody and downright mean towards me. His sarcastic tone can be chilling. He won’t communicate his feelings. He won’t initiate sex even though he wants it. His behavior hurts my feelings badly.  I can’t take it anymore!
 
I am STARVED for affection and intimacy. The things that I crave, he does not do. This includes acting like he is happy to see me when he comes home, kissing me, putting his arm around me, complimenting me on how I look or for something that I have done. Just doing little things that spouses do for each other to show that they care.Do something nice for  me that is unexpected such as making a romantic dinner or buying a bouquet of flowers for no reason. Communicate with me. Ask me how I am doing. Suggest fun things to do together. Make me feel sexy. Make me feel loved and cared for through his actions or words.  Go to bed at the same time as me instead of staying up to watch tv! Tell me that he loves me.  (does he?) These are all simple things and don’t take much effort.  
 
By alienating me, it creates a  hostile environment and not one that would cultivate a more intimate relationship.
 
I have discussed my low libido with my gyn doc many times. He prescribed a testosterone cream a few years ago that I was willing to try but it did not seem to make a difference. I have been using an estrogen cream to help the vaginal dryness. I have bought lubrication to use. I carefully pick out my outfits to look sexy when we go places when it just the 2 of us. When we recently vacationed in Mexico, I wore a dressy outfit every night for dinner and  even in the romantic setting that we were in, he never once during the week told me that I looked nice. I was crushed.  I suggested going to Annapolis to celebrate our anniversary.
 
I am the one that initiates sex.
 
I love my husband and would do whatever it takes to improve our marriage and make us both happy.  It will take both of  us to do that.
 
I need him to talk to me. It was a start that he told me to look at the blog as others expressed the same feeling he was feeling. He would not tell me his feelings directly. It made me do a lot of thinking and I thought that writing out my feelings that he could read would start us in the right direction.

- SO does the initiating 1/3 of the time. After years of never doing it, it feels great.

- Doing better at work, opportunities for advancement are starting to appear in the mid to long term. Fucking love showing up to work now. 

- One knee's problems seem to have been resolved, now only the other one left. Still frustrating that exercise is painful and weight loss is negligible but there is definitely progress.

We've been together four years, but with two being dead, as in maybe once every 4-6 weeks,  if I'm lucky. After his last deployment is when everything went downhill for us in the bedroom, which coincided with us moving in together.

I've heard all the excuses, I've been rejected more times than I care to admit, etc. At first I was devastated and thought it truly was my fault. But after a while I realized his lack of communication about it was on him, not me. I honestly thought some if it could honestly just be life getting in the way. His father passed away unexpectedly a few months after it started, and shortly before he returned and this started, I was seriously injured, resulting in major hip surgery that a year later I'm still recovering from.

Recently I have come to find out our lack of sex has nothing to do with any of those things. In reality its because he's severely passive aggressive, and no sex is a way of punishing me. For the first time in years, everything fit about his behavior. The way he procrastinators when stuff is for me, how he never takes blame for anything, his anger issues, his lack of intimacy but no problem taking a blow job and never reciprocating, all the lies, frequently moody but always claiming nothing was wrong...

Withholding sex is his way of punishing me  for doing things that upsets him, and he has been passive aggressive so long, he didn't even realize that's what he was doing. Just like him ""forgetting"" to do things for me. He knew I wanted sex, and keeping it from me was more important than opening up and telling me what was wrong. And it has the added bonus of avoiding something that helps form an emotional connection.

I don't know if he's going to truly change and not be passive aggressive anymore. He's in counseling, but he's having a hard time accepting the changes he needs to make, despite truly wanting to have healthy relationships in general.

I wonder how many people are in passive aggressive relationships and not mismatched libidos? I'm hoping by sharing my story others can relate with encouragement, advice, or by realizing what their own issue might be.

1374180411.0,21,self.DeadBedrooms,1il2mq,I hit a new low this morning- sobbing over his still-sleeping morning wood. So I wrote a letter. Help?,25,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1il2mq/i_hit_a_new_low_this_morning_sobbing_over_his/,"This is my first post here, and I haven't been lurking for very long, so I apologize if you've heard all of this before. 


Background: We've been dating for two years. I love him with all of my heart. We're both young (mid 20s), no kids. He has undiagnosed bowel issues, somewhat like IBS or chron's. We don't have health insurance (until I find a nursing job) so for now going to the doctor isn't an option. We have sex about once a month, albeit it is good when he actually gets into it. 


This morning I felt his morning wood against me, and started sobbing. He was still sleeping. I knew I wouldn't be getting any. I couldn't just reach down for it because I couldn't handle the inevitable rejection. I'm starting to feel really depressed, and the bedroom rejection makes it so much worse. So I wrote him a letter. I haven't given it to him yet. I'm a bad writer and even worse speaker, so I would appreciate any help you can give in order to get my message across. 



**The letter:** 


""I feel hurt. I think you are perfect and amazing in every other way except for the sex frequency category. The thing is- sex is very very important to me. And it’s not about having an orgasm. Its not about feeling a hard dick. It’s about me feeling like a woman, feeling wanted, desired, and loved. 


I need this intimacy to truly feel fulfilled in a relationship- and I’m not crazy or a slut for needing that. It is normal. I don’t want to feel like a chore. I want to feel like someone cares about me enough to lick me up and down and make me feel like a queen. Maybe that makes me selfish, but I would love to lick you up and down every night and make you feel like a king. I love you. I want to make you feel good, because I’m a living breathing woman who’s willing to give you blowjobs or anal or whatever else you want to do. 


It hurts to feel such strong sexual feelings toward you, and feel like I’m getting very little in return. Yes, we do have great sex every once and a while. But it has gotten to the point where great sex once a month almost hurts worse, because I feel like it was just an act, or I somehow didn’t perform well enough for you. I understand you don’t feel like doing anything when your stomach hurts, and there’s not much that can be done about that. 


Except, I know you masturbate. I know you get boners. I see them and feel them when you’re sleeping – which means you get them when you’re awake. Am I just too hard to bother with? Is it that hard to get me to come, or that much of a waste of time? Am I not pretty enough? Do I not give you good enough orgasms? Or would you rather just look at some other girl’s butthole on the big-screen tv?
 These are the places my mind goes when you haven’t shown interest in me in weeks… all the while dropping hints that you’re going to “do me soon.” I don’t get my hopes up anymore, because it hurts too much. I try not to hit on you, because the rejection stings too much now. I feel fragile and alone. I feel like a slut for thinking about it so often. I don’t like feeling this way. I want to feel loved. And I don’t know what else to do except give you this letter.""

- relationship started, it was great. No DB at all.
- job overseas came up. 90 days on, 30 days back. (But couldn't spend it all back in the US)

-tried talking more and more. Kept getting ""I can't just turn it on like a switch."" ""We will see what happens when you get back.""

Well, I have been back for a few months and nothing has changed. We've had sex a handful of times and she seems like she is doing it just to get it over with. I keep hearing the ""I'm not used to sex"" line, and ""all you want is sex"" and ""bringing it up makes me want to NOT do it."" So I'm expected to just not talk about it. I've tried the hours and hours of caressing, cuddling, massages, kissing, romance out the ears, to no avail. It's starting to make me resent it. I try to ask what else we can do and the response is usually ""I don't know."" I hear that answer to a lot of questions, actually.

I decided that I needed to speak to someone &amp; have been going to see a psychologist weekly for about 2 months now. 

After many sessions, my psychologist states clearly that she is positive that my ex-partner has undiagnosed adult Aspergers Syndrome. It varies across individuals.  I never would have guessed it in a million years.

Gradually, it became clear that all of his 'quirks' I brushed off in the 4.5 years we were together was actually something deeper, a neurological condition. I never understood why I often felt lonely &amp; neglected (both emotionally &amp; physically). 

I never understood why he didn't like being touched, was averse to bodily fluids/kissing/perfumes, why he was so introverted &amp; couldn't quite enjoy social functions. I never understood why there was always a lack of back &amp; forth dialogue/no response or why he would often withdraw when I tried to resolve problems. This is only a fraction of what I didn't see before.     

I have no doubt now that his underlying anxiety was the main factor to our DB. 

I knew, with every fibre of my being, that he was a gentle, loyal, non malicious person and would not hurt me. Now I know that he's wired differently, and is unable to process things the same way as most people.       

All I am saying is that this was a real eye-opener for me. Its easier to hate someone or resent someone for what they did or didn't do for you but in some instances, there might be another answer other than ""s/he is a LL &amp; doesn't care about your needs.'

Over the years the flirting has gone, then the sexy touching, the sexy kissing, the casual touching, the casual kissing, and finally the sex.

Over a decade ago, she said that she prefers quality over quantity.  Well it didn't take long for the quality to go to shits too.

For the past 6 months, I've been trying to stay positive and helpful; we had a few talks about my needs, and the ""concensus"" was that I should see a shrink to see if I could deal with my problem that way. Yes, it's ""my"" problem. Not ""ours"".

A month ago we had good sex on a saturday morning, and it was me initiating it and pretty much pushing her to enjoy herself. I had been initiating everything in the past month: kissing, casual touching while watching TV, etc...  The week following I noticed that the initiating of everything seemed to be a silent reponsability of mine.  If I didn't kiss her when she got back from work (I am always home before her), she certainly would not initiate it. This realization depressed me greatly. I tried to keep my spirits up.

Two weeks ago, I proposed sex. I was offered a quickie. I was to serve myself, but to hurry up.  Most here will suddenly scream at me not do to it, as it really feels about one notch higher than rape, that's it. After that event, at that point, I decided to just give up.  I just stopped initiating anything.

So, we've been roomates for 2 weeks now, it feels like. No touching, period.

Fast forward to last night. We go to bed, pretty early, she watches her favorite show on the iPad. Lights out, and not even a goodnight kiss. That's the first time in two decades.  I fell asleep for a few minutes and then woke right back up.  I spent the rest of the night fighting with myself on how totally fucked up my life was.  I crave affection with someone who could be perfectly happy with being roomates and fucking once every few months.  Put two kids in the mix, and my mind is pretty much fit to be tied. I have been in this situation on and off for more than 15 years.

The thing is that to survive the next decade with her, I have to shut myself off, and yet be attentive, happy, and a great father.  I guess the only solution remaining for me is religion...

There were a few minor issues - I sometimes like my woman to really go the extra mile for me, put on some sexy lingerie, strip tease, make an event of it, whereas she wasn't too into that. Also, I tended to last longer than she'd prefer... she'd want it to last 15 minutes ideally, after having 7 squirting orgasms or so, she's done, whereas I often like to have a marathon session with all kinds of positions, yknow, really put my girl through her through her paces... but all in all things were grand, I was happy to be getting as much as I was and she seemed to be as well.

All throughout the pregnancy, and after we moved in together, things were still fine. Not as excellent as before, perhaps, but still fine. Due to the pregnancy, we couldn't go at it as hard as we used to, and many positions were off limits... also, we were extremely busy at the time, what with the wedding planning, moving my stuff, and adjusting to living together, and as a result we didn't have as much time to just chill out and enjoy each other as a couple, let alone put much effort/creativity into our sex life. I was still satisfied, though, as I considered this all to be a transitional period, and besides, I felt all tender and protective of my wife and the little critter growing inside it. Then came the 7 month marker. We both decided to cut sex off at this point, worrying that too much jostling might not be good for the baby... this I was also fine with. I mean, it's for my baby right? 2 months is not a long time.

She ended up having a c section, which obviously meant more waiting as her body recovered. (Nothing next a vaginal delivery I'm sure) So, another 2 months or so pass. She finally feels ready again (though nervous), and one day I wake up to a freshly showered, naked, anxious but happy wife snuggled in bed next to me. One thing leads to another, we take it very slow and gentle, but then... it hurts. I cannot recall her ever being that tight. A lot of decidedly unsexy struggling, poking and prodding ensues. We do finally manage to do the deed, but at an almost snail's pace, and only missionary.  She seemed relieved when it was over.

That all I could handle - in fact, I had somewhat expected it, given the lengthy abstinence. I figure so long as we take it slow and gentle, eventually we'll get back into the swing of things and be going at it full tilt like usual.

Of course, that's not quite what happened. After the initial sex session, problems began to become apparent. My wife isn't one of those who feels comfortable doing it with baby sleeping in the room, or even the next room... someone has to be watching baby or she can't relax enough to get into it. Ok, understandable. Problem was, she was too nervous to hand baby over to just anyone - it had to be one of a few specific family members, all of whom are themselves fairly busy. Even when the criteria were met and we were getting into it, though, I could tell part of her mind was still elsewhere, in mommy-mode land. She needed 'intimate time with no sex' first to get into the mood. Which, given the fact that these family members of hers are not too keen on watching a wailing baby for very long, presented a problem.

Fast forward another 2 sexless months. After lots of communication, some frustration on my part and some crying on hers, we work it out, and decide baby is old enough to have some different people caring for her. We decide to set aside a day for couple-time-plus-sex whenever we can. This is 100% me pushing for all this, by the way; I'm sure the pattern is familiar to most of you. We ask another young mom we know to watch the baby, go through the usual routine - god I hate that word - shower, have foreplay, go down to the room, more foreplay, douse absolutely everything in a liberal coating of lube, struggle to insert penis for several minutes, get into it finally, ensure that my wife has several orgasms by being as creative as I possibly can using missionary only (everything else hurts), finish up.

Is this the turning of a new leaf? Maybe the start of regularly occuring sex sessions which will allow my wife's vagina to become reacquianted with its good buddy in a way that allows for easier access and eventually better sex times (as I desperately hope?) Unfortunately not. No sooner had I found a way to deal with the baby situation than 'I'm not in the mood because of baby' became 'I'm just not in the mood.' With some of the distractions cleared away, my wife was able to realize that, bottom line, she just wasn't into sex as much as before.

I should mention here that I suffer one character flaw - perhaps a strength, depending on how you see it - I'm extremely impatient when it comes to relationship issues. When something bothers me I do not want to sit there feeling like shit, I want to fix it. I will do anything within my power TO fix it until whatever was bothering me is dealt with and I am satisfied once more. I was very lazy/weak, passive, and complacent in an earlier relationship which ended up crashing and burning. Since then, I decided I will not allow me or the person I am with to be unhappy in any way. I just simply will not allow it.

In this case, the lack of sex was bothering me. Gnawing at me. I did not blame my wife, nor do I now, but the temptation to was fierce. I just felt irritable, impatient and snappy... no matter what she did or said some part of my mind was 'yeah yeah yeah that's nice and all BUT GIVE ME SOME SEX.' I did not feel like my usual cheerful, capable, confident, happy self. I mean, I just don't think it's possible to feel that way without being able to have sex with the woman I live with, love, and gave my life to be with.

The next 2 months of my life were spent in what I guess is the usual HL with LL pattern. Me searching obsessively for information on female low libido and how to cure/manage it, and being fucking miserable. Some of what I found I knew either didn't apply to me, or was bullshit. Such as that crap about doing the chores, pampering your girl, romancing her with candle lit dinners and flowers and just waiting on her hand and foot. When my wife trotted out that laundry list of issues that she wanted fixed so she could MAYBE feel in the mood to sleep with me, it was one of the most stressful, depressing moments of my life. I quickly realized though, it was just her mind fumbling around for stuff that might be the cause of the problem, when in reality neither of us knew what it really was.

I remember being in the kitchen one day, washing the dishes for her after a long day spent taking care of baby, watching dumb shows that she likes and I don't, being her human comfy chair and listening to her gab about her friends on facebook, and so forth. Whilst washing dishes, my mind was, as always, filled with endless erotic thoughts about how much I want to caress, tease, ravish, and basically just fuck the living shit out of my wife. Reminiscing inwardly about the vain manner by which I was striving to achieve that goal. All the romantic notes, flowers, little gifts, couple time, back massages, baby watching so she can relax, and other stuff I was giving her. Not really out of the usual for me, but I was putting a bit more effort in these days, particularly as far as spending time with her to be ""intimate with no sex"".

So yeah. There I am standing in front of the sink after a long, hard, sexless, and mostly unfulfilling day, after nearly a year of almost no sex with my beloved wife. Thinking about what else I can possibly do. And suddenly it just hits me all at once, like a physical blow. I am not happy. I don't feel good at all. I feel, in fact, like a pile of fly ridden, crusty shit.

This was about the point in time where I discovered r/deadbedrooms. I already knew I could not be the only man with this problem, but reading the stories was extremely helpful nonetheless. Strangely, it was particularly helpful reading the female HL / male LL stories. Maybe because it feels less like a ""man's burden"" type deal that we're all just supposed to stoicly endure with only the ocassional snarky joke to vent our true feelings.

So, having read this business about 'the talk' and how it sometimes works, I come back to my wife again, and gently but firmly explain to her that I am fucking miserable due to lack of sex with her, and try to figure out together what we can do to resolve it. I can't remember what exactly was said, but we ended up scheduling another sex session for that weekend.

My god, it was amazing. She was still tight, everything was still very vanilla, but just knowing I could make love to my wife finally, after all that hope, despair, frustration and blue balling, was just... incredible. We made love the first day and she came plenty, no squirting or anything, but it just felt great and soothing and... I felt like my normal self again afterward, all smiles, not a trace of impatience. Life was a song. The next day we actually did it again - two times in as many days!!!!!!!!!!!! - and this time she squirted so much it drenched an entire towel as well as our sheets. She's never come that hard or long before and that is saying something... Jesus, I cannot begin to express the surge of emotions and hope I felt while gazing at that towel.

However, what I knew above all else, I did not want a repeat of history. I did not want this to be merely the second quarter-annual sex session. After reading so many people's experiences, and reflecting on my own, I knew that what I really wanted wasn't just sex, although that's part of it, what I want is my wife to WANT to have sex with me again.

And... now we've reached the real problem. Because after communicating, it became clear that she does not. My wife, who I communicate with, treat well, and love dearly... whose body is perfectly capable of sex, can crave sex, and even make her beg for sex, does not WANT sex mentally. Many threads I read here mention 'letting your body lead your mind instead of waiting for your mind to lead your body.' I have brought this up with my wife several times, and her answer is that she doesn't want to have duty sex, and that it would be like rape. Apparently, the few times she managed to have sex with me after the baby were a result of intense mental preparation lasting days, by which process she was able to force herself to want sex.

I do not feel comfortable with this. I do not feel comfortable with the idea of raping my wife, so duty sex is out of the question. I do not even feel comfortable with the idea that she is having to like, do some crazy iron will meditation over the course of days just to have sex with me, and that the effort leaves her spiritually drained and that it's some huge ordeal for her. God dammit, I want my wife to WANT to have sex with me, not want to have sex with me on some distant meta level that can only translate into actual sex through some herculean feat of will.

After some time spent coping with all these hard truths, we talked it over decided that hormones are probably the culprit. She is still breast feeding the baby. However, she also has a birth control implant which we got right after she gave birth, which also coincides neatly with the time she first started seriously not wanting sex. I desperately want her to remove this infernal contraption from her body. She is, unfortunately, terrified of getting pregnant again... one baby is already so much to handle, and such a huge change. She says 'wait til I stop breastfeeding and then we'll see. Please be patient.' I would love to be patient. I am, however, fucking miserable and it is only getting worse. I fap, I don't fap, I hide my emotions, I communicate my emotions to my wife - none of it makes a difference. I am miserable. I spent about half the day thinking about my wife and this shitty situation and wishing I could have sex with her. I find myself frowning, punching and headbutting random things and being cold to everyone I meet. My misery bleeds over into my relationship and makes my wife unhappy as well. I will never cheat on her, betray her or hurt her in any way but sometimes I wish I could just drink myself into a stupor or ... I don't know what. Hug someone. Cry, maybe.

Anyway. Just wanted to throw my story out, maybe it will help someone else feel less alone. I talk to my wife about this problem, there are no secrets between us, but I can't always be talking to her about it because it will spoil all the time we spend together - but in my mind it's always there. Thanks for reading and letting me vent.

PS. I realize having sex 4 times in a one year period is a lot to some people. Not me. Guess I am more HL than I ever knew.",,False,,t5_2t25p,1366105741.0,,,True,t3_1cgajh,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1cgajh/25mhl_wife_is_21fll_just_need_to_vent/,

Talking about it usually makes me feel worse about it but I'm feeling particularly beat down in general right now so I kind of just wanted to vent, I hope you don't mind. (This ended up being really long, I'm sorry. It didn't even really make me feel better but lately nothing does.)

I kind of figured I'd post here eventually when I got to the point of having ""the talk"" or something or I finally got around to seeing a therapist or I don't know just something, anything, productive. But I have nothing productive to say. Just feelings.

I'm 25F, HL. Well, average to low libido, I always thought. I've gone very long periods without sex with no distress. Never been a huge priority for me. My boyfriend is 28, LL. Well, absolutely no libido. We have been in a relationship for almost a year, dated casually even longer. 

I could count the number of times we have had sex on one fingerless hand.

Like I said, sex has never been a huge priority for me, so when he told me he has a very low sex drive, I [stupidly] thought I hit the boyfriend jackpot. I'm used to dating people with a disproportionately higher sex drive than me and thought this would be awesome. 

It was awesome, I was really happy. I love falling asleep cuddling. He's so affectionate, and I've never felt so loved or cared for my entire life

But it also feels so *hollow*.

I can't remember the last time he didn't turn his face away from mine after a quick kiss. 

He's never initiated anything sexual. An occasional grope, a slightly suggestive comment now and then.  No follow through. No advances. 

The times I have tried to initiate sex, he barely seemed into it, and he couldn't get an erection. So we have never had sex. Ever. The few times we've talked about it he has excuses. says it's psychological, he's had his T levels tested, asked doctors about it, no solutions, but says he wants this, he wants me, he's attracted to me, and not to give up on him. But I can't. I feel like an idiot if I try to be sexy or make a move. I feel like a monster.

We are both always stupid busy, we get to spend a lot of time together but we're usually working on our respective academic work and we both are often on super tight deadlines and have a lot to do. I don't even think about sex often or even want it often, but when I do, it hurts to think about. The topic tends to ""bother"" me only about once a month, to maybe explain how we've gotten this far without any resolution. I dunno.

The last time it came up, a few weeks ago, I asked, don't you ever want to get off? He says he masturbates and watches porn. I found that site yourbrainonporn.com and sent him a link to it because it seemed possible it could be the issue. I don't know. He got the message. I mean, he physically got the email I sent with the link, but has never mentioned it to me, and has since looked at porn so I guess didn't really care or take it seriously. 

I didn't notice my self esteem was disappearing, but it did, and it took most of my confidence with it. I can't try initiating sex, because I hate myself. I hate myself for needing sex. 

One time recently he had been flirty all night, we were having an awesome night. We went to bed a little early and said he wasn't very tired and he was feeling me up and kissing me, I was so fucking turned on just from him touching my hips, I was absolutely certain we were going to do something. He kissed me again and said goodnight, and turned away to sleep. I was stunned. I've never been *mad* about this before that night. I stayed awake in bed until almost 5am, silently crying and being mad, mad at him for being like this and mad at myself for wanting it enough for it to make me MAD. Anger is the single most out of character emotion for me, it just isn't a natural state for me to be in. He woke up to my crying and asked me what was wrong, he really had no idea. I said nothing for a minute because I couldn't say what I needed to. I eventually said I was crying because I couldn't sleep. He cuddled me and fell back asleep. 

I once researched health blogs and other sites to find out about how to increase your libido, to take the opposite advice to try to decrease my own. Because if I could just take that out and make sex not an issue, I have the best friend I've ever had in my entire life and a partner who makes life easier and more fun and makes me a better person. Then I realized, that's kind of messed up.

Dated for 4 years prior.  We have 1 child who's not quite a year old.

As is typical of these back stories, the sex was wild and rampant.  We would participate in some form of sexual activity at least daily.  It dwindled when she decided to adhere to our preacher's suggestion of abstinence until marriage and it has never really recovered.  Since getting married,  it is not uncommon for us to go almost a month without intimacy (penetrative sex or otherwise).

I've talked to her about it since we got married and the usual excuses came up (tired, stressed from job, etc).  I tried initiating in a passive way (back rubs that escalate), and have been rejected more often than not.  I've tried being more forceful in initiations, but then the sex ends up being one-sided and not pleasing (during or afterwards).

I've tried giving up initiating all together, but my libido is too high and I find her too attractive sexually to cut myself off completely.

We have a young child and while that could be an explanation, there's really been no change in initiation from her now versus prior to getting pregnant, so I don't think it's an issue.

Most recently, we celebrated our 3 year anniversary by spending a weekend away together.  The usual flirtations were abound, but I try to initiate actual sex, she shuts down, eventually falling asleep on me despite she being the one who initiated the flirtation during our trip.

I worry that this has become the new normal for us and I'm unhappy with it.  I've tried talking to her about it, and after stating the usual excuses, she says she'll do better, but nothing has changed.

What baffles me the most is that in recent weeks she's told me that she's started watching porn more often, something she never did before meeting me.  While at first I was elated as I feel it is good for a woman to explore what turns her on, I now wonder if that is in fact part of the problem.

I've grown tired of initiating, but if she's not gonna initiate, I don't know what I'm going to do.  As all of us know, rejection hurts.  Especially from those we love...

But now we're terrified of having another kid, so we use a condom in addition to the pill. She's a dead fish in bed. I can't feel anything with a condom on. It's hard enough to get into any good position. She just lays there, either face up or down. She doesn't want to get off, she just wants me to get done. She has excuses like she's tired/sick/whatever but basically she doesn't participate or want an orgasm.

And then it happened. She actually allows it once a week now, which is enough to keep me from dying. But the last time I couldn't get off at all. No feeling, lost erection. I realized I don't enjoy sex with her anymore. I love looking at her ass, I feel attracted to her, but now I don't want to initiate. What's worse than coming to the once a week sex session and going away from it wishing it didn't happen?

I don't know what to think. Maybe that's it, no more sex with her. She'd be happy. I've talked to her about this, she got angry that she's trying to 'accommodate' me and I always talk/complain about sex. Divorce is out of the question. I have a kid. No that's not really a good reason but I wouldn't be able to face life explaining to all friends/family why my marriage failed when I have such a caring/loving wife and I'm such a boring/unfriendly guy. I'm an introvert, I'm blunt and direct, so most people don't take to that. I don't treat people differently when in public, so it seems that I'm mean. Frankly if we were to split friends in a divorce she'd get all of them.

I have lurked this subreddit for awhile and have been dealing with a DB for close to a year now. With encounters happening as little as once every 2-3 months. Dealt with it for a long time because my SO had a very labor intensive job and I understood he was tired at the end of the day. Had 'the talk' quite a few times. I would always explain how it didn't have to be PIV sex I just wanted some 'us' time. His response was always either ""I'm tired"" or ""I don't know what to tell you"". Offered lots of blowjobs thinking 'hey, he doesn't have to do anything surely he'll be into it"" but got turned down nearly every time. So I finally gave up. I did not try to initiate, mention, or ask for anything sexual. This went on for 4 months. 

Finally I decided to try one more time and wrote him a letter. In the letter I explained how him ignoring me like that made me feel awful. I told him how complete strangers who catcall me in public made me feel more desired than he did and how that fact disgusted and upset me. I said that I needed to feel like I was attractive to him and how the whole situation had made me really insecure and made me feel like there was something wrong with me. Telling me I am pretty occasionally and flirting with me only after I have flirted with him and made it obvious I would like a response was not enough to make me feel like he desired me. I begged him to tell me what the problem was, what I was or wasn't doing, if he was even still attracted to me at all.

This finally struck a cord with him. I gave it to him one morning and that evening we talked about it. He said that I was right about him not putting in any effort and admitted that he had this problem before. He told me that it was hard for him to think of me as as sex object (not the best word for it but I understood what he meant) because he was in love with me. He said he had separated love and sex for so long it was hard for him to put the two back together but that he did not realize the toll this took on me emotionally and how bad it made me feel. He assured me that he is attracted to me and desires me and that he will work on making sure I am very well aware of it. Even told me if he starts slipping up and returning to his old ways to tell him immediately and not to wait and let it build it up. This is the first time he has been this open with me about this subject and this has renewed my hope for us.

I am also going to do more to let him know how much I want him. Going to tell him how often I think about him, send dirty texts/pictures. I stopped doing all this when I felt ignored because I didn't think he would care or react. We've both made promises to try more and to keep each other in check and this is the first time I have felt truly optimistic about this situation in a long time.

I should mention that outside of the bedroom we have always had a good relationship. We have nearly all the same interests, love spending time together and are generally very laid back and goofy with one another. The only thing in our relationship that was missing was the intimacy.

DB for at least 4 years (less than once a month). It has been 5 weeks since our last encounter if you don't count an aborted one three weeks ago (kids interrupted).

So here is what I want to do. I want to wait until she initiates.  We have gone six months without sex in the past and although it was pretty hellish at the time I found reddit a month or so ago and it has given me a new perspective on things. Which fills me with confidence that I can at least try.

I never completely understood when she said I was harassing her for sex. I heard the words and promised to do it  less  (and did) but never honestly 'got it'. I have read enough posts from LL partners here to finally get some understanding and this is one of the reasons I want to do this. There are other reasons including body image issues on her part (she is now running everyday and loving it after decades of me telling her how great it is for your self esteem... only took some other mums from the kid's school to make her take it up.. bah humbug) and some changes I want to do for myself.

I am going to give myself a makeover (clothes, weight, work habits, maybe even eating habits, friends, etc) and generally just go back to being who I was when we first met. It is going to be tough specially at the beginning but I have come to realize that I have let myself go in the past 8 years partly as a result of depression after a change of careers. We had planned for me to be a stay at home husband for 5 years but after I left my job and was set to go she chickened out and reneged on the deal. The reasons why she chickened out were valid but it was mostly about her using her low earning potential as an excuse for not even trying. This was a devastating event for me because it was something we had put into our life plan since the beginning many years prior. I struggled for 4 years to get over it. 

I made the decision to try this recently after she commented on my weight a week or two ago. I agreed she was right about it and said I was actually thinking about doing something about it (have been for a couple of months). I wasn't hurt about the weight comment, it is true after all. I was a bit miffed about the tone (I am fit and you are gross) but let it slide. She sometimes comments that she used to like my body definition when I was younger and we sometimes joke that she wants ""Eighties Doug"" (from an episode of The King of Queens ). I never had a six pack though and she always wanted me to. So now I intend to get one.

What can go wrong? I might not pull it off to starters, or she might continue to be as LL as ever and I would have forfeited the odd sex encounter for many months. I hope neither is the case but if the later occurs I'll be having 'the talk' (for the nth time) with the difference that I plan to have changed myself for the better as much as I can before I do. Yes, I will need her input on this and plan to get it. Just not presented in a ""having the talk"" context. Just little conversations here and there and concentrating solely on me. Sounds like a bit of a setup and to an extent it is. Should she see it as such it all might end really bad. Sadly, I am to the point I care very little if that were to happen.


**TL,DR: Giving myself a makeover and waiting until she initiates sex.** 



**UPDATE: Week 1**. Thought about ""reseting the counter"" at the beginning of the week. She had a REAL migraine for two days. No dice. Started running/cycling. Knees very tender. Lots of icing. Still working up to a daily routine (knees main factor). Joined local sports team. So far so good.

SO says she was thinking about getting a treadmill for herself and now that I am exercising it is easier to justify the $$.

Innocent comment in bed got me a ""don't ask for sex now"" death stare last night. I honestly wasn't asking. Maybe I should not make ambiguous comments while lying in bed naked. ;-)


**UPDATE: Week 2**. SO seems a little more affectionate. Almost as if she missed some of my 'harrasment'.  Went furniture shopping (for the living room) with mixed results. It was a great shared experience until it came to decision time. I mentioned moving the location of the TV and it we ended up tiring ourselves out discussing the possibilities. No big deal except for her parting comment ""you always do this""... 

Work was extremely busy which helped keep my mind off sex. Made a new female friend. I used to have lots of female friends before. I forgot how fun it was.

**UPDATE:
Week 3**: Ditched work for the weekend (making an effort to not work on the weekends). SO noticed and was seemingly happy about it.  She also mentioned that I was sexually harassing her IN HER DREAMS... gee fucking wheez... I tried to laugh it off but it hurt.  

Exercise is getting better. Knees don't hurt as much. Doing 3X1 hour sessions per week. No change in weight though. Also trying to do away with midnight snacks (trying to not wake up at 2 am in the first place)

This first paragraph will give you a better picture of the situation. I'm a 20 year old college student with a high libido. College has made me exposed to a lot of new people and I constantly work on my appearance and obviously many girls have taken notice of me and I feel attractive and interesting. While this should be a positive outcome, I feel trapped nevertheless. When I come home to our apartment I'm the one that has to clean, cook, buy groceries, dish, and wash our stuff. And if something breaks down, I will be the one that has to ""fix"" it or call the plumber or w/e. When that's done I proceed to study and do homework and that's when my SO wants to spend time with me. Spend time = Sit next to her as she is chatting with her colleagues online or watch a movie together. She works part-time and when needed so she'll spend time at home.

Now to our bedroom. Well she's never been one to initiate sex much, and on the lap of 3 years I remember about 3-5 times that were on her initiative and on some of those it was because ""it's a good way to pass the time at least."". She's never been too keen on sex in general and I have always accepted our differences because I've been satisfied with the amount of sex received at those times. I've always been the initiator and some times she's declined my request. Being declined for whatever reason hurts but I always thought ""alright, maybe later then"". If I ask or try ""to make a move"" after being declined she'll get upset telling me I'm just interested in sex and just that. Just before you ask, the sex is great and when we first got together we had amazing sex.

Around christmas, we both got into a big fight and we had our first real ""the talk"" and we said to wait with the breakup and see how we feel in a couple of days now that we've finally talked honestly with each other. After we've talked I waited a couple of days until I tried to seduce her to show her that I still find her attractive. No luck. She said she needed time to ""think about us"" and withholds sex of any kind until she's feeling more secure of how she is feeling. I was crushed, I felt like she doesn't find me attractive, or affectionate.

So I've given her more space, I've let her go to parties without me, I've slept on the couch, and I've been kind and nice to her to show that I care about her. Still nothing from her part, no initiative. She's given me a kiss or so a few times but that's mostly before she's going to work or coming back from work. It's been over a month now since we had the talk and nothing still. I feel like a servant more than a boyfriend. I'm still the one that does all the housework. Now she is getting more upset on me, telling me that I'm insensitive and not very cuddly and understanding. Well… I don't feel cuddly when the person I love hasn't showed any signs of affection in over a month. I'm reaching the end of my patience with her and I don't know what to do. I love her, but on the span of a month, I slowly feel like I'm not in love with her…

We don't talk that much. She's a mostly-stay-at-home mom (mostly, see below), takes the kids to dance/girl scouts, does the laundry. I knew her stress levels were getting up there, so I hired a housecleaner to come in every two weeks to lessen the load and her stress. I watch the kids when she works on Saturday (and I do spend time with them instead of gaming...mostly). I take them to the pool, play in the yard, etc...I know that my kids are the most important things in my life. 

Every Friday and Saturday night, we watch a movie together. We don't do ""date nights"" too much, since it's tough to find a sitter for 3 little kids given their extracurricular activities. Most other nights, she spends her time watching her DVR'd shows, and I spend my time in my office gaming. Ah, my gaming....

I have addictive tendencies. Specifically, I *really* get into my games, and that has, in the past, hurt our relationship. So, I know that I was at fault, and made some corrections. I'm still an addict, though. I know it.

I used to play WoW 12-15 hours a day (I worked from home, so it was easy). I would eat dinner in the office, and the kids (10, 8, 4 currently) all knew when it was ""daddy's raid time"". I even blew off my anniversary one year to go on a trip with my gaming buddies. I eventually recognized that the game was destroying my life. I quit WoW when we moved (for my job - this was 3 years ago), but recently found another timesink which consumes my evenings and weekends (although, I make it an absolute point to eat with my family every night, and can pause the game (or rather, teleport back to town) when the kids come in). 

So...it's still a very dead bedroom. I've had ""The Talk"" (in a limited way, I imagine) with her. I laid out that I wished she would initiate more, instead of me being grabby. I laid out that it's important to me, but ultimately, I think she thinks that it's a chore. I'm not satisfied with her physical appearance (she's put on a good amount of weight) and I think that contributes to *my* lack of interest (We've discussed that as well), and I've actually changed my eating habits and dropped 45 pounds in the past year or so (down to a respectable 185 from 230). Between her lack of response, my views on her weight, and my (admittedly)....quick fuse....in the bedroom, I guess part of it is my fear to disappoint her if and when she does say yes, and part of it is just the physical unattractiveness that I feel towards her. Just for reference, I do view porn and fap regularly (not every day, but every couple, I'd say). I'm not into anything crazy - mostly MILF/Older Women, not into any fetish or ""teen"" stuff. Pretty normal for my age (40), I'd guess.  

So instead of fighting for it, I retreat to my office and play (I don't fap when others are in the house). I go to bed at 10pm, every night, and lately she's been coming to bed at 11-11:30, by which time I'm asleep. I wake up at 6:30, and start another day.

I'm 27 (f) and my husband is 26. We've been together for 9 years and married for about 9 months. I can't believe that things have gotten to this point so soon. 

We always had a very active sex life, with the exception of a few month period where I was having issues with the birth control I was on. I wasn't giving it to him enough, so I switched pills and everything was fine. 

The few months before our wedding were spectacular. We were trying new things, and getting to a much more kinky and dirty level. We still made love, but this new sex was making an appearance quite often. I absolutely loved it. I never felt so close to him or myself. 

Things changed the day we got back from our honeymoon. He was completely miserable and never in the mood. Finally, after about a month of pretty much no affection from him, we had a talk over some drinks. He told me that he felt different. He didn't want a wife who was ""into that freaky shit"", and that I was going to have to be ok with ""normal sex"". 

This is what normal sex is though - Saturday or Sunday morning (never both), he rolls over, starts having sex with me for about a minute and a half. He finishes, then rolls back over and sleeps some more. This happens maybe 3 out of the 4 weeks each month. So I don't know if I qualify as having a dead bedroom. All I know is that 3 times a month is not making me feel very happy or in love any more. 

I try to initiate it more during the week. Most of the time, he tells me he's too tired. I've tried talking to him. Asked him to go to counseling with me. Asked him for more affection and love...or for him to initiate it every so often. He refuses. Sometimes though, he ""lets"" me give him a blowjob, which I do, in hopes that it will lead to more. It never does. 

I know my appearance isn't an issue. I've actually lost close to 20 pounds since the wedding. I'm more healthy and fit than I've ever been. I feel like a freak though. Like, there must be something wrong with me for wanting sex this much.

I wish I had found this place when I was suffering through a miserable, sexless cohabitation with my ex. We started seeing each other 4 years ago and hooking up on weekends, almost always after lots of drinking. Well, the unthinkable happened and she forgot to take a few bc pills and got pregnant. So I played the part of the dad and bought a house and started planning for a proposal. We got along well and never fought. I thought it would work.

Anyhow, it turned out that without alcohol, her sex drive was nonexistent. We had sex maybe twice while she was pregnant. After my daughter was born, I didn't pressure her for sex. We went months without being intimate. Over the next year and a half, we had sex maybe 6 times, all on nights where she went out drinking with girlfriends and came home at 3am and woke me up for sex. That really made me feel used. I was also very suspicious of her texting her guy friends all the time. 

Anyhow, it came to head on Christmas. I had gone overboard on gifts to try and wow her, but that had the opposite effect. She retreated to our room and texted all day while I played with our daughter all day. She went to bed without even telling me. I woke her up and confronted her that night. I asked how it had gotten so bad. She just said she felt like we were going through the motions. She said she could go the rest of her life without having sex. She told me it was to late to talk about it any more. The next night she told me she was going out to dinner with a girlfriend. She didn't come home until 6am, and I stayed up all night waiting for her. I told her she needed to find a new place to live.

Anyhow, that was 6 months ago. Shes been living with her parents and has totally reverted to the bar/drinking/partying lifestyle and apparently screwing half the town. She has also been seeing a therapist. I know it's a good thing she's out of my life and she never really loved me, but I can't help but feel guilty for not trying harder to make it work for my daughters sake. If I had been happy with a dead bedroom, we would still be a family. I look at my daughter and feel like I failed her as a father. 

Not sure there is really a question in there or I'd I just needed to get it off my chest. For whatever reason, alcohol is a trigger for my ex's libido and that's just not the kind of life I want to live. I'm not sure if she'll grow out of it (I'm 30 and she's 25) or if she has a serious problem that will affect her whole life. I'm scared to start dating again.

I have no real purpose other than to get this off my chest...  This turned out way, way longer than I intended.  Sorry about that, and I understand if people don’t want to read it – I probably wouldn’t either.

So standard story, guy meets girl, lots and lots of great sex, guy marries girl, kids come, and sex drops WAY off.  My oldest child is 8, and since she was born there has been a lack of intimacy.  We went through several periods where we would have sex once every two months.  I'm aware there's much worse stories out there, but coming from what we had it was quite a change.

Fine, I understand that.  Things change, responsibilities grow, sex takes less precedence as the relationship ages -- but not to the degree it has.  She was well aware I was a highly sexed person, and billed herself as someone more than willing to reciprocate.  Come to find out, that's not exactly the case.  Sounding like a classic bait/switch yet?

So I tried many different approaches to get things going again.  Many things I've tried I've come to find from reading this forum were probably mistakes.  About a year ago I bought the ""sex starved marriage"" and delivered it to my wife along with a lengthy letter in which I spilled my guts.  I told her how much I needed her, to be close to her, and how awful I felt that that part of our relationship was gone.  I packed it in her bag when she was leaving for a business trip, and when she came back there was much crying, talking, and promises made to fulfill needs.

And it worked.... for a while.  We actually settled on approximately once a week.  And it was going off without a hitch for a few months.  Then things started to come up, reasons to delay sex became ever more frequent, and we were slipping back into the same old routine (or lack of, depending on your perspective).  

So about a month ago I gently reminded her of our conversation from a year ago, and pointed out how things had slipped - rather dramatically --- again ---. 

So her response was along the lines of ""well if you just need to get off then just fuck me right now and get it over with.""  Despite the fact that I've explained more times than I can count that sex with my wife is about far more than ""getting off"".

But I did.  I fucked her with as much passion and love as I could muster under the circumstances, and I'd like to think I did pretty well.  Here's a little weird thing though - we have always had great sex, even when infrequent, when it happens it’s still very good for both parties.  This time though she steadfastly refused to get into it.  In retrospect I should have just quit and not finished and let her know that her actions were as bad, if not worse, than denying sex completely.  But being the weak person that I am at times, I finished up and wrote it off as a fluke.

But I didn't do that tonight.  Tonight I brought sex up, for about the 3rd time in the last two weeks.  This time instead of being outright denied I got a similar response: ""if you need to I guess you can"".  I'm really wishing I declined right there, but I didn't.  Instead I tried extensive foreplay, oral, teasing.... basically all the things that I know should have been triggers for her.  Eventually I started doing ""my thing"", but stupidly still trying to get some interest I suppose I took longer than I should have.  She asked me if I ""would be done soon"". 

And that was the end of it.  I stopped, got my clothes on, and went out and got some coffee, sitting in the booth and bawling my eyes out the whole time.  I'm sure it was probably a weird sight, but I couldn't really muster up the energy to care.

I came home after a couple of hours and told her ""I will never ask for sex from you or mention sex to you again - that's probably easier for both of us.""  I'm not sure if that was a good thing to say or not, but I've pretty much given up any hope of having a fulfilling sexual relationship with this woman ever again, so I doubt I could have done too much harm.  

[Her response to anyone curious was along the lines of ""I don't want that but you make me feel like it's a chore"".  I really wasn't sure how to reply to that considering the 10,000 differing approaches I’ve taken, so I just went upstairs]

And now here I sit upstairs.  I feel emotionally amped up yet vacant at the same time.  I don't think that makes sense but I don't know how else to describe it.  I did mean what I said.  I won't subject myself to her rejection or reluctant compliance ever again.  I fully intend to never so much as mention it to her again.

So here I am with some decisions to make.  Of course these are all complicated by kids and an otherwise happy home.  

I am not denying myself sex.  I've gotten over feeling selfish for making it a make-or-break issue.  I believe I deserve a healthy relationship where each partner woks hard to satisfy the other's needs.

I've turned down opportunities even very recently because I want to be with my wife, but now that it seems clear she doesn't want to be with me I feel absolutely no uneasiness about ""stepping out"".  As of this second I feel like telling her I'm going to get a girlfriend and she can either deal with it or not.  I don't want to break up my children's home (which is otherwise very happy, stable, and loving) but I'm not willing to deny myself meaningful human connection for the next 15 years.

I lied a bit.  After typing that I still feel like a selfish asshole for considering breaking up my family over ""just sex"" (although I'm sure most of you realize that it's far from ""just sex"").  

So I really have no idea what the fuck to do.  I'm never attempting to have sex with that woman again.  The misery it causes me just isn't worth the occasional pleasant encounter.  I'm not willing to forego sex until my kids are grown.  Having a girlfriend just isn't what I want to do, but then again neither is divorce.  Fuck her for putting me in this position.
If you read this far then I thank you for your patience.  I don’t really know what kind of feedback I’m looking for – I just really needed to get this off my chest.

What do I do?,21,3,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/uhfzw/my_wife_is_a_closet_lesbian_what_do_i_do/,"I have known this since we first met, but as we dated it seemed like it had just been a phase. She is afraid to come out gay because it goes against what she has been told her whole life. (20 years old) Now after hearing her say that she doesn't find penises attractive and only really gets turned on by watching lesbian porn,  and that she still is in love with the last girl that she kissed, I think it is high time we consider our mutual happiness instead of this charade. Any ideas as to what I should say? 

EDIT: Background requested, here it is. 
Background: 
Age 14 - Started to first experiment with girls, kissing only. Has a crush on her friend Sarah.
Age 15 - Was forcibly fingered and made to watch porn by a male family friend who was 19 years old. She was very sexually active with boys after this point, but had an anything-but-sex-goes rule. She continued kissing her girl-friends thru this.
Age 16 - Starts taking showers with girls at partys and becoming more sexual than just kissing.
Age 17 - Has a threesome with her friend and her friend's boyfriend. She loved being eaten out by a girl and was eating out her friend. The boyfriend rapes her weeks later while she is drunk. 
Age 18 - Meets me, we start to date. We get married one year later at age 19. Her parents divorce one month before our wedding, sending her into an emotional down-spin. She told me later that that for several months before and after our wedding she was just ""numb"" inside."" 
Age 19-20 - She still has dreams about her crush Sarah and other girls that are very sexual. We have sex maybe once a month, and she can't get turned on unless she watches some lesbian porn or starts to masturbate with her bullet vibrator, and she usually finishes before I have a chance to step in, so she has me suck on her nipples and slap her ass until she is done. I told her that if she wants to date a girl to see if it makes her happier then she can go ahead and do it. She refuses, but is curious. After she watches a lesbian shower orgy video, I put an ad on craigslist for a lesbian shower orgy for her. She is really excited about it, but feels bad and doesn't want to go through with it. She is very conflicted about her feelings from a religious standpoint and because she has an aversion to divorce from her parents and grandparents. After seeing her facebook message one of the many girls she had kissed and asking if she was still lesbian, I decided to put this on reddit as I feel like the evidence is stacked, I haven't been happy since we got married (1.5 years now) and she seems completely uninterested in me sexually and emotionally. I suppose I am trying to get up the courage to talk about divorce with her, but am scared to because of her family history of divorce. Might need some liquid courage.

She will not touch me or talk about what is going on. If I try to initiate sex, she does not stop me, but checks out. She looks at me as if I am molesting her. This has killed my sex drive.

How we got here: She just got done with RN school a year ago, I am the one who raised the kids (two hers, one ours), cooked and cleaned while she went to school. As she was doing so, her weight ballooned up, I never said anything about it, I just told her that I loved her for her, not how she looked. All she would do is school, work, study and eat sitting on our bed watching TV. No real interaction around the house, but hey she was in school and it kept her busy. 

So a little over a year ago she got done, passed her boards and became an RN. This is where it started. She did not want to become an equal partner again, she wanted to work and do ""her"" thing, and I let it happen. She would go out with her friends and be gone late, she started calling me boring and a stick in the mud, she said I was no fun. She has dropped the weight and is working out. She looks great.

I got caught up in raising kids and running the house along with working a busy full time job. Did I lose my way? I don't think so, I did what had to be done to keep the family moving along.

Our sex life was so-so then, I started it most of the time, her sometimes. Well I felt used and neglected so I stopped being the initiator mostly. Things did not improve. Now we don't do it, she does not touch me and says she gives me all she can, which is a big nothing. She loves me to rub and tickle her backside, but if I reach around to the front, then I am the pig who only wants sex.

I don't want only sex, I want intimacy. I feel so alone and unwanted, this is killing me. We are arguing about this, but it just turns into fights. 

I am willing to take any and all suggestions. If this keeps up, we are going to split up and that is not what I want.

We got into an argument last night and I admitted to her that our sex drives were just incompatible at this point. She cried, told me ""it wasn't me, it was her"" and ""she might need to talk to someone about this"" (meaning a professional).

I've tried alot of things to keep things moving - date nights, remembering to keep talking/non sexual things on par with the sex, games to keep things light and fun, trips &amp; vacations, quizzes (can't remember the name, quizzes to learn more about each other's preferences, etc.) I'm just about ready to quit.

We have 3 kids under the age of 8, the youngest is 3. In the beginning sex was great and plentiful like most new relationships. While we were having our kids we've gone from slow to now being at a complete stop. During this time I've expressed my desire for sex, intimacy and closeness and she would frequently counter with common responses about being tired, no desire etc. Our last time was last May on our anniversary. Her comment was ""Let's do this because I know it's what you want but remember it's for you not me so just get done"". That really hurt me. However I haven't broached the topic as it was always ends the same way, she feels there isn't a problem and I can ""just deal"".  

So, what's interesting is we get along famously as husband and wife, we have many common interests, and some not in common as well. Divorce is not even remotely an option and I know neither of us has the desire for it, nor an open marriage. I am not interested in cheating and I know she's not cheating. 
We are and have always approached our marriage as a team and it works for us. We share all household and parenting responsibilities equally and it works out well for us. We have occasional ""dates"" where just she and I go out for some fun, although with the kids this happens infrequently.  I think the issue is her complete lack of libido. Out of everything I've read so far, my guess would be her anti-depressant and her weight is what's killing her desire.

My plan is to discuss it with her this weekend while we are doing some spring cleaning in the yard. My hope is to explain to her how I am missing our sense of closeness, and that it's not healthy for a true relationship to be sexless. I will definitely ask her to talk to her doctor about ways she can gain her libido back. So anyway, let me know if you have any other suggestions and wish me luck!

Only, it's sad that these problems keep continuing.  I'd just like to rant a bit.

I'm nearly 24, he's nearly 28, been together almost 4 years; no sex for 3 years. That's most of our relationship. It started when I first got pregnant; it was too soon, but he wanted to keep it. He said he'd always found pregnant women sexy, but guess what, sex once while I was pregnant and none after whatsoever.

He used to be the initiator - you know, for the first 4 months. I tried sometimes, but I'm a very shy person. When the bedroom dried up, I asked all the time, but of course got rejected. I don't ask anymore. I think he lost sexual interest in me. Really. His eyes are never passionate, his body language never inviting. When some random guy on the street looks my way I'm genuinely surprised, because I've felt so ugly and hopeless all this time. He is emotionally abusive.

Sex is only part of our problem, but it is a big problem. I work PT, go to school FT, clean and cook; he stays home and collects unemployment, and ""takes care"" of our son but does a bad job imo. I tell him to go out, and hang out with friends, whatever - but he is a total geek. Just wants to stay home and play video games. So, fine. But here's the thing. He is so friendly, too friendly, with certain girls online. Just one of recent. It really bugs me. He doesn't sense a problem. I want to throw a pillow at him and say, ""Why are you spending 5 hours straight talking to her? I'm right here! Of course I'm jealous, because you never spend any time with me.""

I'm irrational if I ever bring this up, so I don't anymore. I only make $200 a week(after taxes). I cannot afford to move out. I use his car(that his parents bought him) for transportation. I work later than the buses here operate. I feel sort of trapped. I still like him..maybe..but this is not a healthy relationship, at all. I don't have any friends, ANY friends, because I'd eventually talk about my horrid relationship and they'd lose all respect for me(it's happened before). So I am, apart from my son and cats, alone. It's hard. I could write a novel but this is enough for one night. The end. :(

My girlfriend and I are 29 and been in a relationship for 3 years.

After the 6 month mark sex dropped down to near non existent because of an issue she was having with the pill and needed some minor surgery for.  I think this was more to do with the honeymoon period ending rather than that issue. So sex because extremely rare and I would say about once a month.

So we talked about it and things got better for awhile(improvement for 1-2 weeks) but sure enough they drop back to once a month. This has happened repeatably during our relationship.

So I just gave up, I got sick of being constantly rejected and then eventually talked to her about the sex issue with her.  She would blame the fact I stopped initating it as the reason however two weeks afterwards I tried to initiate and was always rejected. So I stopped initiating again.

The main thing that gets me is she blames my lack of initiating when honestly it doesn't matter, if she wants it she will do it otherwise she wont and make so many conditions  and prerequisites that have to be met.. She has to have showered (or not just showered), no stress during the day, can't have eaten in the last few hours, too tired, just woke up, isn't feeling well, is hungry, etc. She is just using these as excuses because when she is in the mood everything above doesn't matter.

The rare times when she wants it is usually a really bad time like after I have been asleep for an hour, so I am really not in the mood(or awake). However if she gets rejected a few times It becomes a major issue that has to be rectified straight away.

I am so over the double standard I honestly think I have stopped seeing her in a sexual way.  I still care for her and I do want sex but I don't think I see her sexually.  I am bitter over this whole issue and it doesn't seem to matter how much we talk about it things will always revert back to they always do.  It probably wouldn't be so bad except there is a dash of hypocricy in there as well.

There was something she wanted me to do awhile ago and she offered giving me head as a motivator to do it. (I was annoyed she was using sex as a bargaining chip and let her know it)  She said oh she wasn't it was a bit of fun and she wants to.  So I did it and she never delivered, that was a year ago.

We have tried taking her off the pill and it had little to no effect apart from the initial burst which happens when I drop the ultimatium anyway.

I have told her I am not prepared to be in a sexless relationship and I am over giving that ultimatium, since she just seems to do enough to placate me and then things go back to normal.  Should I just end it? Is there something else I can try?

Our problems were much more than sex, the man had become rabid racist asshole man, not working, lotsa drinking, and no sex, no job.
So I did eventually get everything set up and sat him down and had the talk, told him I was leaving and we had to decide how to work everything out with the kids, etc.  But basically it was over, I assumed he also thought it was a dead relationship since he'd been uninterested for so long; was just hoping for non-violent resolution.

Apparently I was wrong about a lot.  The man hit bottom and bounced.  Turned his attitude upside down, started being nice to the kids, and me.

Still no sex.

Then he did discover I was cheating, actually by jumping to wrong conclusions about some stuff he found, but once confronted I did disclose everything - how I had been standing, thinking, ""well, maybe I should just have an affair?  But how could I ever find someone?"" when a man walked up and...And how it had Really Changed Me Sexually, that I had now a partner who loved my body - MY body, and was so far ahead of me and that now I could enjoy so many things that I never even knew about, mindblowingly awesome sex.  I ended up apologizing for the bad sex that we had had before, and told him it really had just taken someone who knew what they were doing to sort of ""unlock"" me.

After the initial shock, many things came out.  Man had physical problems preventing him from fucking easily, depression, other stuff.

He said better for me to keep seeing the FWB as he was not going to be able to do as much as I would want, even though he wanted to.  And I said thank you, and I will give him the same consideration when he is well, to explore with someone else if he likes.

AND, we have also become closer and had actual sex more times in the last week than in the last two years.  Which is better now, because of the additional experience I picked up.

I would never have predicted this in a million years.

Weird resolution, but a lot better.

TL; DR: Very bad relationship with no sex turned around into more open relationship with communication.

1327420640.0,18,self.DeadBedrooms,oukbv,"Advice for women, from a man.  What masturbation does to a man's sex drive.",27,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/oukbv/advice_for_women_from_a_man_what_masturbation/,"I've read a lot of posts here from women where they mention how their partner is not asexual because they masturbate a lot.  If you ask me, this is the most important reason they are not interested in sex.  I thought I should share my perspective on what masturbation does to my sex drive.

I'm a healthy 26 year old guy in a dead bedroom situation myself, so to satisfy my needs I usually masturbate twice a day, once in the morning after she has left for work and once before going to bed.  

***Masturbating, even once, completely kills my sex drive***

That doesn't mean that it makes it impossible for me to have sex or orgasm, it means that my body is *no longer interested* in sex, and that visual stimuli don't get me going.  Since I masturbate in the mornings, I usually go through my entire day without getting horny.  This is on purpose, because I don't want to be too tempted to cheat on my wife.  I can look at hot women and appreciate their beauty, but I don't get an uncontrollable ""i want to fuck her right now"" feeling like I do if I don't masturbate.  Actually, I get that feeling around most women, not just hot ones, if I hadn't masturbated.

Because I have masturbated earlier in the day, when I usually try to initiate sex with my wife, it's when *my body isn't feeling it*.  My brain knows that after we start making out, I'll get horny and ready to go, but it's not hormones that are driving me to the bedroom, it's the knowledge that I'll have a good time.  I never have a problem getting hard once we start making out, but I don't get horny just by looking at her.

For science, I tried to find out the most I could masturbate in a day.  I got to six times because after that, it's just not physically possible for me to orgasm and my arm got sore.  The first two times I could do with my imagination.  The next two took light porn, the next one hardcore porn, and the final some very BDSM rough stuff.  The last few were also really difficult, like the mood had to be just right and everything had to be perfect.  I've read a comment in this reddit where a woman said her man masturbated 8 times a day and watched transsexual, bondage porn.  That comes as no surprise to me because it takes stuff that intense to do it the 8th time.

So my advice to the women out there in this situation, you should try one of three things:

(1) Convince him to go for 2-3 days without masturbating at all, as an ""experiment"".  Promise him that he can have sex during this period whenever he wants.  I realize this may be a hard conversation to have.  Just remember, ""it will be a fun experiment"", ""you are not against masturbation"", ""you do not have a problem with it"", ""you are not forbidding him from it"", ""it is only for a few days"".  The worst thing you can say is that he's never allowed to masturbate again, because he will REALLY resent you, and will do it behind your back anyways.

(2) Catch him in the morning, before he's had a chance to masturbate.  Almost all guys wake up with a boner.  If he goes to the bathroom as soon as he wakes up, he might be masturbating.  You need to wake him up by making out with him or something and get right into it.

(3) Convince him through logic and reason that even though he isn't feeling like sex right now, after you start making out he will, and he'll have a good time.  This will be difficult since his body is not feeling it.  You need to convince his brain to go through with it.  A warning though, if I've masturbated twice in a day before sex, it takes a lot of effort to stay hard, so this approach will probably backfire.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_oukbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/oukbv/advice_for_women_from_a_man_what_masturbation/,

Eventually it got to the point where she'd reject me 90% of the time, so if I tried 10 times, I might be able to convince her once.   This lead me to feel very unwanted.    Run this process over a 10 year period and things get pretty screwed up.   I've stressed to her the necessity of her actually initiating at least 1/3 (would love half) of the time, but she does not at all.

Even when I do initiate, the sex is pretty bad.   So, after an especially long dry spell, I actually try to initiate sex last week.    She did not respond, and basically fell asleep.    Of course, I was hurt that she didn't try, but I chalked it up to how broken our sex life is and I basically gave up on it.

So a few days later - on Friday - she says she's sorry for rejecting me and she knows it isn't okay.    I just say okay.

Friday night, in an effort to not completely give up, I try initiating again.  She was willing to go as far as get naked, but basically was a dead fish.  No reaction at all.   Rather than having sex with someone that has no intention of liking it, I opted to go to bed.   She also dozed off a bit as well, no luck there.    Who knows if she was faking it.

So, yesterday she went out with a friend (female) while I took care of our daughter.  She came home when my daughter was napping.   This is where it gets difficult.

She was trying to initiate something.  She's not very good at being direct, but she basically said she knew she needed to ""take care of me"".

I close myself off to avoid pain, so I told her no.  Sure, sex would have been nice, but there's no desire there.  She knew she was ""in trouble"" and that she should want to have sex with me and not reject me, but she didn't want me sexually.  

I just hate having sex with her when she clearly doesn't want it.   Honestly, getting a blowjob from a woman that treats it like it is a chore is worse than no blowjob at all - at least for me.

Shortly after that, my sister in law got married.  After the festivities were over, I told my wife that I couldn't wait for her to come around any longer.

I just can't handle having sex less than once a month.  We have been married for 14 years, and this has been a long standing issue.  I mentioned it many times.  I finally asked her to stop saying ""I love you"" because it ripped me apart.  If she loved me, we would be having sex.  The words with no action felt like a knife to my stomach.

So back to last March, I flat out said that there needed to be a change.  I asked if there was anything I could do.  She said she would work on it.  Needless to say, she has been busy starting up a company.  Monthly sales are $80.  I make $12k a month with my consulting business.  We have two kids (12 and 2).  I love my kids, but when my wife puts in a 10 hour day for $10, and calls me to pick up my daughter from day care by 6, it blows my mind.

She can spend 10 hours making $1 an hour, and thinks that that is somehow better than leaving me alone to make money and saving her energy for the sack.  I want to be supportive, but she went from making $80 the first month, to making the same shit 6 months later, yet spending more time doing it.

Got sidetracked again.  Back to the March talk.  I said there needed to be changes by 7/1.  She said that she could do it if she had 3 months.  Needless to say, we had sex once in the last 6 weeks.  Surprisingly, she initiated it.  But it was right in the middle of my weekly RPG session.  I have been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons since 1980.  Me and a few friends get together online Sunday mornings from about 10-3.  It is one of the only things that keeps me sane some times.  Spending some time with people who enjoy my company.

As I left the house this morning, I asked my wife what she wanted to do about the house.  She said she did not want to get a divorce.  I got a hotel room for the night, and here typing.

It's as if I don't matter. 

My love for you is deeper than you'll ever know. And maybe that's the root of the problem. Am I caring too much? Am I asking for too much? 
I feel worthless. Feeling 'undesirable' is even an understatement. An understatement that makes me feel even worse for not being able to pinpoint the right word for whatever bullshit this is. 

You know what makes it even worse? 
Men and women look at me and say that they'd love to know what it feels like to be with me. They tell you that you're lucky to have me, that you've hit the jackpot, and so on and so forth. 
But none of that matters, does it? Screw them. Screw what they think. You're the one who does it for me. But, somehow I'm not doing it for you. It's as if you have to force yourself to kiss me or touch me even though you tell me it's not the case. You say that I'm the most attractive girl you've been with, that you would love to fuck the shit out of me and that it's not me, it's you.

We started off as really good friends, and eventually she confessed her feelings for me. I felt the same way, so we started dating. We were both virgins when the relationship started. I wanted to start having sex almost immediately, but she wanted to wait, and I was fine with that. We waited, got to know each other more intimately, and became even better friends. It was great. 

About six months after we started dating, she decided she was ready. We both enjoyed it, but it became apparent pretty quickly that I wanted it a lot more than she did. I would have done it every day if she wanted to, but the most she ever wanted it was once a week. And I would have even been okay with that, but even when we did have sex, it was like she wanted to get it over with as fast as possible. Eventually it became even less frequent than that, and I couldn't even enjoy the times we did have sex because all I could think about was how long it would be before we did it again.

I started to share my feelings about the situation, but it seemed like the more I opened up about it, the more she closed herself off. Eventually (around 6 months ago, about a year after we started having sex) she decided she didn't want to have sex at all anymore. She said that it was just something she didn't look forward to, and she always felt stressed about it. I think a lot of that had to do with me putting too much pressure on her. She told me she didn't think it would happen again anytime soon. I told her I was okay with all of that, because I definitely didn't want to be pressuring her and I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.

She's not a very sexual person. She doesn't have fantasies, she's never had an orgasm, she doesn't masturbate, and she doesn't really think about sex at all. Because of this, things seemed pretty hopeless to me at this point. So asked her to start exploring her sexuality, in hopes that maybe she would find something within herself and want to start back again. I just wanted some hope. She agreed to this, and said she would do it on her own time.

Now it's been about six months since that conversation, and there really hasn't been progress at all. ""Sexy times"" consist of me masturbating while she lays next to me, and that happens about once a week to once every two weeks. I enjoy it and I still feel a connection when this happens, but I still walk around feeling unfulfilled and rejected most of the time. She hasn't masturbated at all.

It hurts whenever I think about it, and it's pretty much all I think about. I think about what it was like when we were having sex, I think about the things I did wrong, and I think about what it would be like to be with someone who genuinely wants to have sex with me. I've been thinking about that more and more lately.

I try not to say anything, because it usually just ends in tears for both of us. I've brought it up a couple of times within the past two months, and she does say she's ""warming up"" to the idea, but sometimes I think she's just telling me what I want to hear. Sometimes I think she'll never truly enjoy it, and I'm doomed to a dead bedroom if I stay with her. 

I brought it up again today, and she said she might want to eventually, but she didn't want to be persuaded by me and she wants it to be her idea. So I guess I'm just supposed to stop sharing my feelings about the situation, and hope she eventually comes around. Sometimes I think I'm wasting my time. But I'll probably end up waiting, trying to keep on hoping, because I really do love her. She's become my best friend, and just being with her makes me so happy, and that helps me to forget about the sex for a while. But the thoughts always come back, and it's so hard to ignore this part of me that's always in my head.

EDIT: I just realized I left out a pretty important detail. Sometimes the sex was painful for her, and this is one of the reasons she doesn't want to do it anymore. We both know that it's something we can work through (more foreplay, lube), but it's probably still a big part of it. 

The problem is that she doesn't even want to consider it an issue. I've tried to share with her that it's a huge issue for me, but I think she considers that putting pressure on her. It's like the more I even talk about it, the more she doesn't want to do it. And if I don't talk about it, she doesn't even think about it.

Like I said, breaking up would be extremely painful for me. She's intelligent, beautiful, loving, and we have so much in common. Our relationship is perfect outside of this, and I couldn't imagine hurting her like that.

1367508537.0,20,self.DeadBedrooms,1dk035,I am the LL. Is there a prescription medication I can take or therapy that I can do to increase my libido? I feel helpless.,21,1,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1dk035/i_am_the_ll_is_there_a_prescription_medication_i/,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text. TL;DR at the bottom.


As the title says, I'm the LL in the relationship. We haven't been together for very long but it's already taking a toll and I want to do something about it before it becomes crippling. I've had a fluctuating libido all my life so this is not a new issue for me. It has ruined past relationships. I do not want it to ruin this one.


I've tried to get myself in the mood using different strategies such as exercising more, masturbating (without orgasm) before we get together, thinking ""sexy thoughts"" or buying sexy lingerie, eating better, having a few drinks to loosen up, and all that other good stuff. Combined they sort of help.

When we do have sex it's fantastic. We communicate openly and have similar interests. Despite reassuring him that I find him very attractive and that he's great in bed, I still think he doubts his looks and prowess. I hate that my issues are making him feel insecure or unwanted. He deserves to feel amazing because he is amazing.

The root of the problem is a combination of things. I was sexually assaulted a few times as a young teen. When I'm not in the mood and he initiates sex it makes me anxious. On the one hand I want to try to work up some arousal so we can bone, but at the same time my mind goes to very dark places of unwanted touching. Sometimes I can work through it and we have awesome sex... but sometimes my thoughts get so bad that I cry which is a pretty unsexy thing to do and probably really demoralizing for my boyfriend. I feel very ashamed of my inability to perform. I have gone to therapy and will probably have to go for more.

The other issue is that sometimes my body seems unresponsive or turned off by touch. I hate having my breasts touched when I'm not aroused, and sometimes it feels like my clitoris is broken. Meaning, I can feel sensation but it doesn't feel arousing; it's like having someone touch a benign part of my body, like my arm. I feel like a plastic doll.


So what do? I would love to have sex on a regular basis to replace my negative sexual memories with positive ones, to make my boyfriend happy, and to bring us closer together. I don't want to rely on a prescription forever, but having something to get the ball rolling while I start going to therapy would be amazing. It just seems like most libido-enhancing drugs on the market are either ineffective or shady. Recommendations or warnings welcome!

I am a 19 year old female and I have been with my bf for the past 4 and a half years.  Our relationship is awesome.  We are moving in together this summer and are excited about college and our future and all of that.  The only issues is, having sex is very difficult for us.  We waited 4 years and 2 months to start having sex (we were both  virgins) and then we really haven't at all for the past 2 months.  I was sexually abused when I was 14 and have flashbacks and I can rarely focus on being with him.  It's driving me insane, because I want to be with him without thinking about my abuse or being triggered in any sort of way.  We decided to just stop because of all of this.  
Well, a few nights ago we decided to have sex, we were staying at his dorm and his roommate was out.  We had never done it in the dorms before.  Well, his roommate got bored so he thought he'd come find us, and low and behold he walked in on us.  Apparently he heard what was going on from the outside of the door (embarrassing!!!!) and decided to interrupt things for shits an giggles... anyway so our first time making love in 2 months was interrupted and that was humiliating on so many levels.  
A few weeks after we started having sex I thought I had a really bad yeast infection so I went to the doctor.  We found out that I had a latex allergy and that I had a bacterial infection from latex irritation.  That was embarrassing too, but more so was that the medicine the doctor prescribed me interfered with my antidepressant (which i'm on due to family issues my senior year of high school) and made me suicidal.  I stopped taking that, and my doctor had to prescribe me something totally different which was over 90 dollars (I don't have insurance).  I'm a broke college student, I spent about 150 dollars on meds just for that and that made me depressed because nothing can ever go right when we have sex.
So now i'm really not looking forward to having sex again because of trauma and then my latex allergy (yay polyurethane?), and then, the first time i've been aroused in months his roommate walks in on us.  
It sucks and I've been depressed about it for a while.  It never works out.  He said he's fine with everything and doesn't want to have sex again until I am ready, which is really sweet of him I just am so confused as to why this always has to be a struggle.  
Anyway, I've been taking a new anti depressant (my ssri was interfering with my libido) and that has helped with arousal but even when i'm physically aroused I still don't want to have sex.  It's driving me nuts, I just want to be able to be with my partner and not have all these complications.  *sigh*

In the beginning, we started out as a long distance couple because we met online. Lots of phone sex and flirty texts, and when we got to see eachother every few months, a hot weekend of endless sex that was mindblowing. It was passionate, acrobatic, crazy.

When we moved in together the sex continued but as time went on it dropped and dropped. 

I got to a point where I didn't want to be touched. We would lay in bed, not touching, and if he reached over to touch me I would tolerate it then move him away or move away myself after a few moments. Cuddling was out of the question. Kisses were chaste pecks on the lip. Sex was like a chore and we only did it maybe a few times a month. Blowjobs? Yeah that wasn't happening, and I didn't want him going down on me so I never let him. We didn't hold hands. I'd still rub his back from time to him and I'd give him hugs but that was all. We were like sort of close roommates who occasionally had awkward sex.
 
My libido dips coincided with periods of depression for me. Instead of bouncing back, each period of depression I let my lowered libido just stay lowered and allowed the sex and affection to taper off more and more.
 
We each still used porn and masturbated. I would say at least once or twice a day for each of us we'd watch porn and get off rather than be intimate with one another. 

During a fight about a year ago, my husband blurted out that my lack of sexual interest made him feel less than human and made him feel unloved. He said he worked really hard to make sure I had fun, he always made me cum, and why wasn't he enough? He broke down crying in a way I have never, ever seen another person and I have never in my life felt like such a complete piece of shit as I did then.
  
In the month following I did a lot of soul searching. I felt like I hadn't really been taking responsibility for my sexuality and for my sexual pleasure. My libido had flagged and I had blamed it on him, subconsciously- like it was his fault for not figuring out what I liked and didn't and what bothered me and what got my crank going. Like it was his duty to raise my libido following a depression. Like it was his obligation to explore kinks and pleasures I was into but weren't necessarily his cup of tea. 

I sat my husband down and I told him that shit had to change but that I needed his help. I laid my sexual soul bare to him: I told him that if he wanted me to blow him to completion he needed to promise eat more fruit or else his cum tasted too funny, otherwise I had no problem. I told him that if he wanted to play with my nipples he needed to only do so when he wanted to fuck me, not as a ""going to sleep cuddle move"" because when he did that it was like the equivalent of blue balls for me and made me not want to be touched because it made me so angry. I told him to not tickle me, not even jokingly, because it made me associate his touch with something unsexy and I hated that (I am ticklish to a fault). I told him that I am really into anal and really into fingering even if he isn't, and I'm going to buy toys to explore that on my own but that I plan on using them in bed to use on myself in tandem with what he does to me, and I hoped he could accept that (he could). I told him I knew he preferred untamed pubic hair but I preferred myself smooth and I needed to be comfortable to feel sexy and empowered (he accepted that too). Basically every single little issue, hang up, little thing I had kept quiet on or not acknowledged or ignored I brought up and talked about. He brought up his own things.

For us, we also agreed to cool it on the porn. We still watch porn but what we watch is limited and very ""tame"". We don't go searching for raunchiness and novelty. I used to need the nastiest, most kinky and perverted pornography to get a weak masturbatory orgasm. Now I can watch a video of a guy making out with a girl and rubbing her clit and have an insane orgasm, imagining myself doing that with my husband while I watch. Reducing our porn consumption individually and as a couple was very helpful.

I won't lie and say the road has been easy. When I am stressed or sad or anxious, which is often, my libido dies. It is work to force my brain to stop and to remember the promise I made myself last year which was that I own my sexuality and will never lose sight of that again. That my sexual pleasure is literally my own to have or not have and that I am not only hurting my husband but myself by not putting in the effort to stay a sexual being.  I don't owe it to him, I owe it to us as a couple to make the effort. I need to nurture and care for my libido as much if not more than he does. It's MY body, it's MY sex drive and thus, it's MY responsibility. 

At this point I will say though that the ""effort"" feels more and more like nothing. I look at him and want to make out with him. I want to touch him. I want to grab him and pull him close. At night when I wake up entangled in his arms I wish he didn't need his rest for work in the morning because half the time I'd love to wake him up just to fuck. When he does something in bed that I don't like, I no longer stay silent. I tell him flat out, ""I'm not into that."" When he does something I do like, I am very direct and tell him how much I love it. He does the same with me. When we first got together it felt like we fucked like hormonal teenagers.. needy, breathless, each selfish and pursuing our own pleasure and frankly using one another's body as a masturbation device as a means to an end. Since becoming a dead bedroom couple and finding our way back, it feels like we fuck differently now, like adults, like two parts of a whole. It really feels like we made a huge leap from amateurs to pro, heh!

I can honestly say I am a lot happier as a whole now too. Our relationship outside of the sex has always been great but outside of the lack of sex I have always been plagued by feelings of guilt and inadequecy and fear because of it. Not only are we having tons of sex again but I finally feel a security I hadn't realized I had lost. 

So what was the point of this? A few things. First is that I've lurked r/deadbedrooms a lot. While I don't doubt that lots of LL partners are dealing with things like hormones, there are undoubtedly lots of LL partners out there who aren't and are dealing with things similar to what I've been through. It's really scary on multiple levels, but please trust me when I say it's freeing as well to just let go and own your sexuality. And it sucks to look in the mirror and take stock of your dead bedroom and realize you have played quite a part in causing it, but remember it's not some permanent indictment to admit you may have fucked up, nor does it absolve your partner of any responsibility. Just realize that it isn't about the blame, it's about recognizing patterns and behavior and fixing it. And realize that if you love your partner and want your love to last and your life to be better as a whole, you will commit to fixing your shit. And if your shit as a couple is your sex life, then that is the shit you will fix come hell or high water, no excuses.

Second thing is in lurking I've seen a lot of HL people in here despairing. Despairing because things are okay for a month then goes to shit. Despairing because there's a fear if they push the issue, their spouse will leave them. Despairing because they're starting to believe the ONLY good reason their partner won't have sex with them is they simply don't love them. I won't lie and say none of the above is ever true. But I have to say-- the above is not what a HL half in a DB situation is doomed to until a relationship is over. Things are many times fixable and not just ""oh yay we went from no sex to once a month, woop dee doo"" type fixable. Maybe not in all cases, but I felt like it may be helpful to see a case where a dead bedroom truly was reborn without the ugly baggage and false starts and problems. There is hope.
So that's my story and observations and lessons and I hope all of you awesome people get your relationships on whatever track they need to be and get to lots of loving. I wanted LL's to know they can turn things around and HL's to know their relationships aren't necessarily over.

He will only have sex in the morning(wood) and on his side, I have to do all the work and he lasts for about a minute and 30 seconds. I am kinky. I am willing to stretch my butt hole out if that's what he likes. But he just seems to be over it. Although , this last time (a week ago) he was on his phone while we were doing it and I said , ""are you looking at porn?"" He said he was reading the news so he would last longer for me. That kinda messes up my head, is he bored , or actually trying to be nice. I bought him a flesh light and it should be in the mail next week. I am going to try and see if he will let me use it on him. The other morning he had wood and I went to go touch it but he got seriously mad! He seemed like he wanted to hit me. He doesn't like to be touched most of the time. But then other times he does!! How in the hell?? I feel literally insane. This no sex thing has been going on for YEARS. there are times were it will be 2 - 3 months between sex. Sigh. I know.

Or so I thought.

At the moment its been about a month or so since we last had sex (we average about once every three weeks - when she is off). And recently I have started to get suspicious, the periods seem to be lasting longer and longer with smaller gaps between so I decided to do something gross. She uses pads which she bags up and puts in the bathroom bin which gets emptied every few weeks or so. I've just spent the last ten minutes going through all this rubbish and you know what. NO FUCKING PERIOD BLOOD ON ANY OF THEM. Why can't she just be honest and tell me she just doesnt want sex? There was about three weeks worth of pads in there soit not like she is only doing it for a few days its a consistent and planned lie.

The worst part is is that she isn't even cheating on me. We work for the same company (different areas) so travel to work together and outside work are together 24/7.

I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for over a month, and I’ve read other stories, books, etc. We’ve had the talk 5-6 times during the length of our relationship. The talk is now pointless. She always says then that she wants it and needs to have that type of intimacy too, but she needs other intimacy that isn’t necessarily sex.  I’ve given into that time and time again, being romantic, no pressure, no expectations. Nothing on birthdays, nothing on mood-setting dates. I’m at a complete loss. 


I guess I am here because I have no one else to talk to about this. All of our friends think we’re in this perfectly happy, sexually spontaneous, fun relationship. On the outside that’s what it looks like. It’s funny to me because she can joke and make sexual comments around others about us, but on the backend, it looks nothing like what she bubbles up to her friends about.


All I want is to be wanted from my wife. I’m a miserable, low self-esteemed individual without. I miss being who I used to be. Currently starting to focus that time on me, but I feel that won’t fix anything either at this rate.

I'm 34(m), she's 30 (f), in this relationship 10 years, married 6; good sex for about first 3 years or so. Seems like any amount of day to day stress is the primary obstacle. Someone on here wrote recently that their marriage feels like they have an unrequited crush on their best friend; I can't find a better description than that.

I read a lot about HL and LL on here, but I don't feel like that applies to me. I feel like I'm a man with a normal libido. Wanting to be intimate with your partner when it's been a month isn't HL. I can wait out her period, I don't want it daily, I masturbate infrequently, etc. When my libido has been allowed to play out naturally, I average 2 times on the weekend and sometimes once during the week. Maybe I just misunderstand the distinction. I'm not beta either, though I am considerate and do the lion's share of chores and things; I have always just had a natural tendency to keep busy. I'm in good shape, I'm outgoing, pretty independent and adventurous. 

I feel like I've lost my ability to initiate, which is something I never used to have a problem with. I've been rejected so many times, but what's worse, is that rejection has often been paired with - A. things about me that prevent her from wanting to have sex or B. her personal problems that make me feel guilty about trying. For example, if I get frustrated with my job, finances, home repairs, then I hear my off-putting personality prevents her from wanting to be intimate with me. Not necessarily on the same day, mind you; I could have had a terrific day, but still encounter my negative traits if she's not in the mood.

When I'd like to be intimate, I'm faced with the likelihood of being denied closeness/affection and of hearing hurtful things about myself. It's classical conditioning really; when I want love/intimacy/sex I get the exact opposite - hurt feelings/no connection/pushed away. So if we've had a good day, low stress, we're alone, I feel attracted to her, and I get the feeling I want to initiate, I know I am just as likely, or more likely, to be hurt when I want intimacy, which prevents me from trying.

I'm sure some of you can relate to this. You can also probably relate to the fact that she is cognizant of both my desire for intimacy and my inability to initiate and she knows how to easily avoid me. Of course, long periods of abstinence make her paranoid I might want to have sex, so I end up being cut off from other sorts of affection too. No hugs, no kisses, no holding hands...anything she feels might lead to sex. She stays up late, goes to bed complaining of how soon morning will arrive, or, if we can sleep in, food will invariably disagree with her right before bed. Of course, it's a catch 22 - she doesn't want to be affectionate because she fears it will lead to sex, but if I try to have sex, she says she doesn't want to because I'm not affectionate ""unless I want to have sex."" 

A side note to LL women - if you've prevented your boyfriend/husband from having sex for weeks, do not complain he doesn't ""cuddle"" or ""spoon"" you. If he tries to initiate, and you don't want to have sex, do not act hurt he doesn't want to spoon you. Sexual frustration is physically and emotionally uncomfortable. You know that trick they teach to dogs where the trainer balances a treat on the dog's nose and the dog is supposed to sit still and not eat it? The only difference here is the dog eventually gets to eat the treat.

I've tried ""the talk"" a thousand times, and in non-accusatory ways; stuff like I have trouble going weeks without intimacy, that I love her and it makes me feel closer to her, that I find her attractive, etc. I've tried to just talk about sex like it is something fun and exciting. When she has told me things to try, I've tried them, though she will invariably deny my efforts the next time I try to talk about it.  

For years I was pretty against smoking weed, but I took it up to deal with my sexual frustration; it helped me fall asleep fast and made me care less about sex. I would say for the first year, weed felt like a miracle, freeing me from the physiological frustration of my libido. If you don't have an addictive personality and live somewhere they allow medical, it's pretty great, but it's much more of a way to avoid the problem than to solve it. Case in point - I've actually envied our pets because she dotes on them and says she loves them; that's pretty fucking sad. Sorry about the rant.

Before we got together, my husband (then a virgin) explained that he finds vaginas foreign and that we'd have to take it really slow and I was happy to feel like I could help him with that. A year later, and he has touched me down there once, which was nice. I don't even need oral or anything, it's just that the year has been filled with almost daily blowjobs, and tbh all I really crave is to roll around and kiss, rather than a peck on the lips. We almost never have sex because I just moved countries to be here and don't have access to birth control yet, and sometimes he says wanking is just easier. I'm writing this now because yesterday I, for the first time, felt no motivation to pleasure him. And that scares me, because I usually love doing that. It's just a year of feeling like he doesn't care about trying to make me feel good has actually made me see anything sexual as mundane and pointless. I guess it's just confusing to me because I love giving so much. 

We got into an argument yesterday because I jokingly said that the clit is like a tiny penis so there's no real foreign object to worry about, and he got really angry, saying that I think he's gay, which I wasn't even remotely thinking. I know he gets off to women-on-women wrestling and stuff so that isn't a worry. I'm not demanding oral, I just want the same kind of euphoria from any really intimate moment that he gets from a bj. He thinks I shouldn't be so upset about him avoiding me, and I've tried my best not to be, but I feel pretty certain that if I stop touching him, he'll feel the same lack of love from me that I am feeling. I guess I'll go ahead and see if he does come to feel that way, so that maybe he can empathize with me.. it's just so hard to avoid the opportunity to feel that even lop-sided intimacy. 

fyi, it's definitely not a hygiene issue. For example, I got a full brazilian on our honeymoon, am a thoroughly clean 115lb girl, and we didn't have sex or pleasure me. I was okay because I knew he felt too pressured, but I think it still shows the direness of the situation.

Ive posted in the past about my dying bedroom [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/119hhr/boring_bedroom_but_not_dead_yet/). The wife and I had a in depth chat about 2 weeks ago. She noticed that I had been short with her and spending most of my free time doing other things away from her. I admitted that I had mostly withdrawn from the relationship and that Ive given up any hope that things would change. She asked me if we weren't married (and only dating) if I would have broken up with her already. I told her yes.

She promised that she would fix things and asked for me to forget the past so we could start fresh. I got upset. I asked her why it took the realization that I was leaving for her to 'get it'. Why couldn't she make the effort months ago after we had 'the talk' for the umpteenth time?

We talked about counseling, which we will most likely attend shortly. I'm not sure that it can help. There are a few reasons why I am unhappy in my marriage. Most can be fixed or I can learn to ignore them (shes somewhat lazy, unmotivated, messy, etc), but no matter what therapy accomplishes, our sex life will never be perfect or 'fulfilling' for me. Her grinning and bearing it inst sexy, and she just doesn't have the drive or curiosity that I do.  

**So herein lies my issue.** Im tired of always being the one who has to compromise. Im tired of never being able to be myself. I feel that when push comes to shove, Im always the one who has to cater to her needs. Ive grown such resentment towards her over all of this. I can say that the spark is entirely gone at the moment and it makes me want to give up and just get it over with. 

Now I know that the above paragraph might make me sound selfish, but I feel like im the doormat. I feel like Im living a cliche. I know relationships arent 50/50, but I feel like Im always doing 95% and she does as little as she can get away with, both with our sex life, her career, the house responsibilities, our pets, etc. 

So how do i swallow my pride and this resentment and try to see if there is any chance of improving our relationship? Ive just gotten so beaten up over the past from being rejected and my needs being her last priority. I REALLY dislike her right now and I hate that I am filled with so much negativity right now.

The past few months have been insane, perhaps the worst of my life since I left school. In March, my husband told me that he'd been compulsively spending money and had problems with BIIIG debts. This led to him getting ongoing treatment for fairly severe depression and other deep-seated mental health issues I wasn't aware of. It's true that people with depression can be wonderful actors, I had no idea he was so unhappy. I've tried to be as supportive as I can. 

However, it also made me look at him without the rose-tinted glasses, and I'm finding it hard to feel sexual attraction to him  (lingering anger about the money, his weight gain, his patchy income - I support us - and his very eccentric habits). We are working to resolve some of this, but he has been trying to lose the weight for years with limited success. He's doing training for a new job which should help with money, and we've been communicating better. But I don't feel a spark like I used to :(

Added to this, he's just last week confessed a huge fetish for femdom and being humiliated. I am usually GGG, and want my husbant to be fulfilled, but this kink makes me deeply uneasy and a little repelled. Even reading good erotica of it leaves me  unhappy. I don't want to humiliate my husband, even as part of a role play or game: it feels as sexy as Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day.

I don't want to have sex with him. I've tried and I felt  no real connection. Dead bedroom. He's unhappy, I feel awful, we talk, I explain, but I don't know how to change myself to feel good about him again.

I'm a pilot (30yrs old), she's an executive at an multi-branch office (31yrs old).  We have 1 small 3 year old boy that keeps us busy.  I travel a lot, and most weekends I'm gone.  She's a 8-5(6) with some travel, which limits our together time to evenings and weekends. 

The marriage as a whole has been decent over the past 7 years.  We've been through ups and downs like most people.  We have a lot to be thankful for that we've worked hard to get: house, cars, child, dog, standard of living.  We're finally out of debt and just starting to enjoy less budgeting.  Over the last 2 years or maybe longer the sex has almost stopped.  I have to beg/plead/guilt/ask to get sex twice a month and sometimes it's less than that.  This has led to a LOT of resentment and anger on my part, but I'm sure it's made her angry too.  It also makes me insecure in my relationship and marriage.  This is a problem because my happiness is so reliant on my marriage and identity in that.  I've tried to talk to her some about the problem, but mostly it was too passive to be productive.  I don't usually have a problem fighting or arguing with people, but I do with my wife for some reason.

Recently we had a big fight about it, and she said, ""We have a problem.  I don't feel like we have an emotional relationship anymore.  I'm not comfortable around you, and I don't want to have sex with you if I'm not comfortable.  We only have surface level talks about what's going on with our son etc, nothing deeper and we're more like roomates.""  To which I responded, ""I know.  I've felt like this for a long time.  I've been trying to do nice things for you for a while now so we do still feel like we're dating, but you keep meeting me with resistance.  I need sex to be part of the equation and I can't keep going on like this without it.  Recently I put a note in your bag when you left town that told you how much I loved you and that I'd miss you while you were gone.  Did you get it?  If you did you never told me.  You never said thanks, or I appreciate it, or I love/miss you too.  I tried holding you hand all day a month ago, and touching your back etc.  You looked at me while we were shopping and said ""Get off me, you're clinging to me like our child.""  I'm not happy with things, and it has to change.""  I think I mentioned divorce somewhere in there, or she inferred it.  She replied, ""I wouldn't have gone there (divorce).  I hate that you went there so fast.  It's just not an option.""  Which I like that she said that.  It makes me believe that she either a) wants to work on things or b) thinks it's not that bad. 

We've been married for 7 years and were friends for 8 before that.  What ""deep"" conversation is there left to have?  What does she mean emotional connection is gone?  How is it I can rub her back in bed 6 nights a week when I'm home (giving her what she wants) and I'm left not getting what I need (sex).  

I'm an awesome Dad, a great housekeeper, a good cook, a good friend/neighbor, and Mr. Fix everything.  I give and give and give, and I don't know what else to do.  I'm miserable because of the lack of sex.  It's making me insecure on many levels.  I mentioned that we go see couples therapy which she agreed to, but ""doesn't know when we'll have time to do it.""  I feel like going may doom our marriage because how many successful marriages actually go to counseling? I feel like I give 90% and she gives 10%.  Anytime we ""talk"" we basically fight and I do not fight well with her.

On another note medically she's on anti-depressants (Buspirone but it's not an SSRI) and has an IUD (Mirena) which she's had for 3 years.  She also takes Tamazapam for sleep aid.   I also know she's slightly anemic but she takes a multi vitamin.  I have no health issues at all. Edit:  I think I might be depressed and easy to anger because of everything but as a pilot I can't take anything. 

Maybe a year ago we had a week where we had sex 3 days in a row.  She was laying in bed next to me and said, ""Wow this is great, I feel like when we were dating"" to which I said ""Yes I know, it's awesome.  I think it's the frequency of sex that lets us feel this way"".  I guess it didn't sink in.

I'm hoping the experience of people here can help guide me.  What do I do?   If I think of more I'll write more soon.  I'm kinda afraid to bring this stuff up to her because it's A) going to cause a fight probably B) If I can't solve things then I'm starting the beginning of the end which I don't want.

I [32F] noticed straight away that this was happening. It was my first proper relationship etc but from what I understood this was fairly normal. The honeymoon period was over.

We moved in together and it became much, much worse. He [35M] was playing his video games a lot more and wouldn't come to bed for hours. I started to get paranoid and thought there was someone else (there wasn't). I finally brought it up (the lack of sex) - things improved and then quickly went back to where they were. This happened a few times... I stopped bringing it up. 

I started noticing guys everywhere. I was never really going to cheat but I was just so damned frustrated... however then slowly I stopped caring. My interest in sex dwindled to the point that I actually feel scared if I think that he might try and initiate (he never does of course)... I don't know what's happened but it's like I've become the one with the problem.

Everything else is pretty much okay - lots of hugs and kisses (just never leads anywhere even if I tried to make it). We still have non-sexy time fun. We argue about the chores like a lot of couples do but there's nothing else 'bad' in the relationship...

...well except that now I feel like I don't really 'feel' anything. I care about him but in some ways he seems more like a friend. He went away for a week and although I missed him it was more of an abstract thing rather than the gut-wrenching feeling I used to have up until fairly recently. We've been together 3 years now and I don't want to throw it away... but part of me also doesn't care.

As cliche as it is after about a year of marriage things cooled off a good bit but over the last 3 or 4 years theyve gotten down right cold. We've talked before about how I have a much higher sex drive and she knows that I'm not satisfied sexually but she doesnt really seem to be to concerned about it.

This weekend we left the kids with family and drove up to the mountains for a weekend anniversary getaway. I had hoped that a little break, relaxation and change of scenery might help things but I've been cold shouldered, huffed at for trying to kiss her, and even had a hug shrugged off. All of this happened before she decided to go to bed at 7:30.

1342248956.0,20,self.DeadBedrooms,wjhub,Fellow DBers - I discovered a game changer,27,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/wjhub/fellow_dbers_i_discovered_a_game_changer/,"[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Intimacy-Desire-Awaken-Passion-Relationship/dp/0825306299)


Stumbled across it about a week or so ago in my quest for more reading. IT IS FANTASTIC. Bought the book for my Kindle and took endless notes and highlighted. Felt so good about reading it, I brought it up to my SO and bought him his own copy. He committed to reading it and now before bed every night we discuss what he read that day (I've finished it already), we share our highlights and notes. I can't believe THIS is what *finally* opened up the floor for him to be comfortable enough to talk with me about our DB. 

For the record we are both 27, 4th year of relationship, not married yet, I am the high libido partner. 

I am applying principles I've read in the book to better myself and I see such a change. Most notably getting rid of my 'reflected sense of self' (a biggie...if you do nothing else, or don't want to buy the book, read up on teh interwebs on 'reflected sense of self' and FREE YOURSELF from thinking about yourself only the way others see you) which caused many problems in and out of my relationship and focusing on my flexible sense of self and holding on to my solid sense of self. **Just because we have a DB and he is the LLP (low libido partner or LDP low desire partner) doesn't mean he is completely to blame;** I had to take a good long look at myself and my actions and how they contributed to the situation too. 

I discovered it's easier for him to hold up the book and say ""I feel like Brett feels in this chapter"" rather than sit down with me and hash out his emotions face to face and say ""I feel like..."" I have gained *so* much insight into what he is feeling about our physical relationship and how he feels about sex in general. Sometimes two partners have different viewpoints and feelings about sex, and just because you are the HDP doesn't make you more right, or put them immediately at fault and it doesn't mean something is wrong with them, just as having a high sex drive doesn't mean there's something wrong with you! 

One of my biggest pet peeves in this community is our ease at which we are telling people to just leave their partners when they aren't satisfied. Many have expressed that they don't WANT to leave their partners and yet people on here are so quick to say leave. Get out. Run for the hills because YOU aren't satisfied RIGHT NOW. 

Sex for me was so easy with my ex that I was taken aback that it was something that needed work in my current relationship, and I used to think it should just come easy like it used to. Well, yeah, I did have amazing, effortless, copious sex with my ex, but he's my EX for a reason, and he was a real shitty person when you got down to brass tacks. I happened to find an amazing person 4 years ago that happens to have a little trouble in the sex department. And I've been agonizing a long time about it, and as recently as last weekend threatened to leave because of our DB. Then I found this book. And through reading the vignettes of different couples and their DB dynamics I started to look at the situation from his eyes. And I started to see what was wrong in the ways I carried *myself*. Now things are beginning to change and I couldn't be more happier. It's opened a dialogue (by far, what I am most impressed by) about a topic in our relationship that's been closed for years. And I know things can only get better from here on out. 

Disclaimer - Yes, I know all relationships are different and what is working for me may not work for others. Some people here are in truly toxic relationships (hey, that's even addressed in the book too!!) and leaving is really what is best. But maybe since you've tried everything else, and many of your are sticking around for the kids anyway so you have the time, a good walk in your SO's shoes might do the trick. It can't hurt.

New York, the last state in the US to lack no-fault divorce, considers ""constructive abandonment"" (not putting out) as perfectly good legal grounds for divorce.

Hell, the Roman Catholic Church, no friend of divorce, has always allowed the annulment of sexless marriages (although I assume, as with balloons, a single prick and boom).

She likes to do lots of things outdoors while I'm a bit more sedentary.  She also feels like I'm too rigid and inflexible (she mentioned how I don't like listening to the radio in the car as an example).  Worse, she feels like I don't allow her to do stuff with her friends (it's not like I forbid her from going out, but sometimes I do feel lonely and sad when she's gone ... she feels a lot of pressure from that).  She thinks that sex is the least of my concerns and that my depression stems from low self-esteem, completely unrelated to our (lack of) sex life.  She got quite defensive on that point, actually.

Another thing we talked about was not having much to do together.  I always want to spend ""quality time"" with her, but I have a hard time thinking of activities to do.  She'll play video games with me once in a while, but she tires of them quickly.  TV shows?  She gets antsy sitting still for that long.  Board games?  Bored games.  Going out?  I like going out to eat with her, but it doesn't satisfy her sense of togetherness.  We're both avid readers, so it's fun to go to the bookstore sometimes, but that still can't fill a lot of time.

Any advice?  I'm glad that she talked to me about this stuff, and I think we can work on improving some of these things, but at the same time I feel like I'll need to completely revamp my personality in order to make her happy.  Right now I'm feeling like I'm just too damn boring for her!

We haven't slept in the same bed for years, because our kids sometimes wake up at night and crawl into our bed, and he can't get enough sleep unless he's in his own space.  

I happen to have a pretty high sex drive, and I'd be happy to have sex every day, but at least once a week would be heavenly compared to how things are now.  

I know this isn't the right thing to do… but I started having an affair a few months ago.

It's great for the few hours I'm with him, but then I'm back to my regular life devoid of kissing, hugging, cuddling, and sex.

I felt like it was there somewhere in him, I just had to tap into it a different way.

I invited him to shower with me, and without being too graphic, I started with a kiss on the neck, and moved on from there. He seemed a bit nervous, but I kept going, and I didn't say a word. Then suddenly, it happened. He spun me around, and right there in the shower.

The next day, I decided to test my hypothesis again. Instead of awkward cuddling, talking about things, I simply laid down next to him, grabbed his penis, stared deep into his eyes, and again.. it happened.

Then, a funny thing happened. The next day, he grabbed *me*. And the next day, he grabbed me *again*. And before he left for family, he said ""I want to give you something to think about while I'm gone"" and he actually touched me without allowing me to touch him. 

I don't know what it is, but something seems to have changed.

I, m[34], married a conservative Christian girl, we had sex once every 2 weeks to start, then 1/month then 1/few months then we went about a year without.  We've been married 12 years now.  

3 years ago I decided my life isn't over yet.  I began a emotional affair (that I hoped would turn into a fully physical one) which is still going strong today, we've done no more than kissing and caressing.  I'm sorry to say, but the affair saved the marriage... sorry in more ways than one.  

Put that on the side burner for now.  With renewed encouragement and confidence I confronted my wife, and I stopped eating the crap.  Crap like sex is just a bonus or a reward and it is a dirty thing and how selfish and filthy and crude I must be to expect it.  She didn't like my new attitude.  Through the next year I told her that I need sex at least twice a week or I'm going elsewhere to find it.  She didn't like that either.  She cried and got angry and told me I was being unfair and rude.

We went to counseling in order to fix my selfishness and my fits of anger.  (I have always been the most laid back guy you've ever met until these last few years.)  It turns out she was the one being unfair.  She (well, we both) realized that she never even looks at me when I talk, therefore she has no idea when I am sad or intense or upset or playful.  She doesn't respect my boundaries though she is perfectly comfortable defending hers tooth and nail.[Boundaries for Marriage](http://www.amazon.com/Boundaries-Marriage-Henry-Cloud/dp/0310243149/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322784144&amp;sr=8-1): read it.

After counseling my wife improved.  We started having sex more often, and when I say sex, I mean we followed the formula we created on our honeymoon: first I pleasure her, and then I take care of myself missionary style.  It has always been (even now) as if the only way she would touch my dick is with her vagina.

Off and on we will do about every other day, (the last couple weeks have been once a week).  (I'M NOT COMPLAINING)  because of the increased frequency we are able to try some new positions, and she is (Oh God, so slowly) learning to get comfortable with my genitalia.  After a year of telling her I want a blowjob, even saying that I'll go elsewhere, I'm still waiting.  This is the next step in dealing with her crap.

It makes me crazy when I read about men with women that were abused or are unable to orgasm or have sex related pain.  That really sucks, but in my case she has never had any of those problems.  I've always assumed maybe she was abused or something like that, but no.  It turns out she just never gave a shit about me.  In a way I kind of wish there was more underneath, it would validate the years of hell that I've had.  It's almost like her sudden turn-around is worse.  

All this to say, our dead bedroom has turned around, but I'm bitter.  I feel like she has stolen the best years of my life.  I don't love her, there are times I hate her.  I use her to fulfill my needs.  I hate who I've become and I blame it all on my patient, kind, thoughtful attitude and the fact that she took advantage of it. 

My affair is with a married woman and neither of us are interested in leaving our spouse/family.  She knows all this about my wife and has been extremely supportive and encouraging.  Finding her saved my marriage.

Thing is, I'm pretty sure I'm the bad guy.",21,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/mumjr/i_think_this_subreddit_is_exactly_what_ive_been/,"Sorry if this is annoying to read, my writing skills have diminished greatly since I finished HS.

I'm not really sure where to start. I guess with the fact that my girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years now and we are absolutely in love. The only problem (I consider it a problem, anyway) is the sex. She isn't the one always turning it down, though; I am. 

For about a year or more after the first time we had sex I was initiating more often than not and would always respond positively when she initiated. After a while, though, I gradually stopped initiating until I got to the point I'm at now where I rarely if ever initiate. She's more than made up for it, but I'd say 4/5 times I turn her down or come up with an excuse or find a way to avoid it. 4/4 times I feel absolutely awful about it.

After thinking about this for a long while I realised that it's not because I've got a diminished sex drive or that I don't find her attractive anymore, because I don't (still masturbate regularly) and I do (I'm always groping her boobs and butt and she has one of the cutest faces I've ever seen). It's because I honestly can't be bothered with the effort I put in compared to what I get in return. 

What I mean by that is, once she's initiated and I've responded positively to her advances, she basically hands the reins over to me and gets me to do pretty much all the work. This would be fine if all the work I put in seemed to go anywhere, but it doesn't. For the 2.5 years we've been having sex, she's never once been able to achieve orgasm. I used to blame myself for that (and still partially do) but we have literally spent HOURS on end in the bed, me following her instruction to the letter on what to do and how fast to do it and how long to do it for with absolutely no result. You can only lie on your stomach pleasuring your woman exactly how she says she wants it but barely getting a moan for so long before you don't really want to do it again.

The other thing is that even before she gets me to take control, there is absolutely no passion. No emotion, no lust, no feeling that she truly, actually wants me. As I've said before, I'm always touching her and I compliment her every chance I get, but I get none of that in return. She can't even give me a peck on the cheek because ""It doesn't feel like I'm doing it right"". It's really hard to want to have sex when you don't feel sexy at all. It's so bad that I can't even get her to make eye-contact with me during sex. In the off chance we do, she just giggles nervously and quickly looks away. 

All of this makes our sex life seem so procedural, bureaucratic even. I don't even feel like I'm making any sort of connection with her when we're doing the most intimate thing any two people can do. Like she's just going through the motions so she can say ""we did it!"".

I've tried bringing these things up as subtly and gently as possible several times in the past, but it always ends up with her either crying to much or being too embarrassed to say anything and no progress is ever made.

So here I am. Turning down my girlfriend's sexual advances because I'm sick to death of putting in work for little reward and feeling like she doesn't even really want me in the first place. So sorry guys, this turned into a rant pretty quickly, but on top of looking for advice I just really needed to vent because I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

Thanks in advance for what advice I may receive.

My wife (34F) and I (31M) have been married for 4 years, but living together for 7 years now.  When we first started dating, there was a significant amount of physical ""exploration.""  We would spend numerous evening, just making-out and having physical contact with each other.  Words were unnecessary.

Once we moved in together, we stopped making out like bunnies, but we spent many evenings, just lying in the bed, giving each other messages and talking.  When we started having sex, it was exciting and frequent (multiple times per week).

Because we weren't teenagers, and we did have to be to work in the morning, the frequency of sex started to trail off, but it was still a number of times every month.  And, more to what I enjoy, I still got to spend lots of time, just caressing her beautiful skin and feeling the warmth of her body on mine.  Oddly, despite repeated requests for make-out sessions, she refused to kiss me with anything deeper than a parent  might kiss a child (at least, outside the throws of passion).

Fast forward to last year (a few years into our marriage); sex has gotten to the point that once a month is stretching it.  I went from Valentines to our Anniversary (in June) w/o any action.  Our evenings plans mostly involve her putting her head in my lap and falling asleep while I watch TV.  She gets remarkably offended if I choose to browse reddit over letting her fall asleep in my lap.  On the rare occasion that work prevents me from being home in our bed from midnight to 6am, she gives me endless grief about not respecting her needs and sleep schedule -- to the point that it is now a running joke in my office that working the midnight to 8am shift costs me a furniture set.  And yet, despite repeated and continuing requests for a make out session (for about 5 years now), she thinks I'm just being ridiculous.

Moving to current conditions, I haven't had sex since November '12, and only a half dozen times in '12.  When I confronted her about not being satisfied with out intimacy, she gave me some story about how she feels queasy when I ""release"" in her, but she feels sore when I use a condom.  When I asked her to have her lady doctor see about treatments that can help, my wife promised that she ask at her next appointment (in December 2013).  When I told her that sex isn't the only intimacy that could help (like a nice make-out session, maybe?), she replies that her falling asleep in my lap is a sign that she trusts me, and I should be happy in knowing that she feels that safe with me.  Whatever.

And then tonight just sent me into insomnia land.  From time to time, about every other month now, she feels the need to cuddle on the couch and spoon in the bed.  That ""need"" lasts about a day or two and always coincides with her period -- which she has consistently quashed as an opportunity for action.  She wants nothing more than my arms wrapped around her; no kissing; no sex; no recognition that I am anything more than a warm set of arms.  Tonight, she was being very insistent that if I didn't start spooning, she was NOT going to let me sleep.

And that is why tonight I am feeling more hurt than ever.  As I told her, I need to know that SHE loves me, not her hormones.  I've ran out of ways of telling her that I understand that she her intimacy needs are fulfilled falling asleep in my lap, but I need more affection from her in more ways.  She says she loves me and cares about me, but I'm having a real hard time believing that when it doesn't appear that she cares about my needs.

I don't desire anyone else but her.  I don't want divorce.  I don't need sex.  I do need intimacy.

We have a 4 year old child, and we both work 9-5 jobs. 

At first it was a long distance relationship, and we had sex every time we got together. In hindsight, I realize that it was 3-4 weeks in between visits, so that might have lead to me thinking we had sex often.

We have sex roughly once every 4-6 weeks now.

I would like to say that we have a pretty decent relationship, but in between the periods of having sex we usually start to get tense and stressed at each other about 3-4 weeks after we have sex. Basically I can feel that whenever we have sex we're much closer, much more open, and much more loving. 
So this results in 2-3 weeks in between each dry patch where we are angry / stressed / and not really getting along well, which makes life feel like it sucks balls.

Throughout our relationship, she has initiated sex 3 or 4 times. I consider myself to have a pretty high libido, and as a result I'm pretty much always the one to initiate, and the one who gets shot down repeatedly. 


So over the past couple of years I've raised the issue of our lack of sex a few times, and she's basically said that I ask for sex too much. That if I didn't ask for sex ""all the time"", she would be more inclined to have sex. 

I can say that having not asked for sex in 6 weeks, that that does not hold true in any way, shape or form. 



She says she feels pressured, If I rub her feet or do something ""nice"" she feels that I am only doing it with the goal of having sex. 
That cuddling or lying in bed together doesn't always need to lead to sex. 

I fully agree with that, and I've tried avoiding anything sexual whilst cuddling or being together in bed, and avoided initiating any form of sexual contact. I've also tried cuddling a few times over the course of a week or two and trying to initiate sex once or twice. Either way, it doesn't seem to change anything.

I'm frustrated. If I suggest sex, I get told that I'm asking for it too often or that she feels pressured. 
If I give up entirely and don't initiate anything, then nothing happens anyway. 

I've mentioned to her that I believe I have a high libido, and that sex is not only about just getting off, but it also brings us closer together. I've seen time and again that it does. She laughed and told me that I don't have a high libido, that I'm just ""normal"". 

She says girls don't go around thinking about having sex like men do. She says she can always be ""convinced"" to have sex, if I ""do the right things"". But having read this subreddit for a while now, jumping through those hoops of trying to ""do the right things"" doesn't seem to work. 
Really? Do women think this way?


Reading this, it kind of reads like I'm trying to ""catch a fish"", trying various methods to get her to have sex, it sounds sad and desperate.

And I guess I am. I'm desperate. I feel like I've been beaten down over the last few years to the point where I hardly ever try to initiate sex anymore. 

As a 30 year old, I feel trapped. It can't be normal to be like this. Maybe we're sexually incompatible. I feel like I'm in a situation where we are just room mates who occasionally have sex.

Sorry if that doesn't really come out sounding coherent. Whenever I think about my situation, it turns into a jumble of emotions. 

Anyone else in a situation like this? Is this a dead bedroom? Am I over reacting? Has anyone solved something like this? Suggestions?

I am a long time lurker, but now I feel getting something of my chest. I have been with my gf for six years now.

We didn't live together, and we both had hectic days so I guessed that this was the reason for our lack of sex. Three weeks ago we moved together. This was big for me. I thought that now we could start working on our dead bedroom. Unfortunately we only had sex one time the first week. I just thought that was because she was stressed out. So was I. The next week she got her period, so that kind of killed the sex part.

So, yesterday she was really sad. And I asked what was wrong. She then confessed to me that she had been having an affair with her friend. She haven't told me how long this has been happening, but it seems like it has been going on for a while.

The worst thing is that I was sickly jealous at her friend. And I was really paranoid that there was something going on. So I confronted her, but she told me that I didn't need to worry. So I felt really bad that I was this paranoid and jealous guy, that couldn't let her have a guy friend. So, I guess my suspicions was right the whole time.

I don't know what to do yet. We have just moved together, and there will be hell to move out again. We have both been living with our parents, and there's no turning back now. I don't know if she's gonna quit seeing her friend, and I don't know if we're going to try to make this work.

 fast forward to 2011 and two kids later. my wife didn't like going down on me and didn't like me going down on her. she doesn't masturbate at all. I took her out for dinner while her parents watched the kids. it was good. I told her that I wanted to talk to her and really opened up about sex and all the desires I had and any she may have. I would do ANYTHING she wanted to because she wants to do it. we went home and she let me titty fuck her and that was fantastic. we locked eyes and I exploded and we had great sex afterwards. 

this lead to us having people watch our kids more often and we started role-playing and other fun things like getting me off with her feet. she never wanted me going down on her and if she did, she wouldn't let me kiss her afterwards. I even started writing her really long and very sexual and sensual text message stories that she enjoyed. she even started going down on me but wouldn't let me cum in her mouth and she really wasn't into it. she let me cum on her face once and that was exhilerating. I remember her telling me she wanted to learn how to give the perfect blow job. for my birthday that year, I told her I wanted 28 blowjobs. one everyday leading up to my 28th birthday. she agreed to this. I always asked if she had any desires and fantasies but she always told me she had none. one day, I put the ball in her court and said she would have to plan what we do next. that lead to nothing. I got no blowjobs and brought it up and she brushed it off. 


fast forward to about a year ago or whenever those damn 50 shades books came out and I told her, if she liked any of that stuff, to let me know. we bought tie downs for the bedroom which we used twice but she decided she doesn't like being held down. 

fast forward to now. she doesn't do anything for me and I have given up. I didn't get her anything for valentines day or mothers day. I don't tell her I love her. I don't kiss her. we talked about it again recently and it just seems like she doesn't want to make me happy. our entire time together, I have done so much to surprise her and make her happy, even if it didn't make me happy or there was no reciprocation.

My wife and I have a 1 year old. I love themm both very dearly. I would say our relationship is strong and healthy. But as you can imagine with my posting here, the sex has been sorely lacking since the little one came into the play. I'm guessing we've had sex maybe 15 times since the little one was conceived which is going on two years now. I'd say we had a healthy sex life before. I totally understand that sex drops off after having a kid for most and I expected to put my penis on the shelf for a little while... but just not in a museum.  A few confounding issues:

-Our little one has been a terrible sleeper. Has only recently been sleeping through the night. We are both tired most of the time. 

-I don't want to come off as bragging (trust me) but I'm fairly large (down there) which made sex uncomfortable for her as she healed, and after when she got an IUD. She got the IUD removed and still finds it a bit painful...not overly so but a bit. She's seen the doctor and there are no concerns. Basically things have shifted a bit after child birth. 

-Every time we have had sex, it's been standard missionary, meat and potatoes kind of sex. Not the most thrilling to be honest. No oral. Just get it wet/hard and put it in. While the engagement in the process has been improving, it often feels like pity sex which I very much appreciate but it isn't the same. I've had to more or less initiate sex each time by proposing we do so a day or two in advance. 

-We have talked about it and she admits she has nowhere near the sex drive she used to and is frustrated as well. Understandably, she says sex is often the last thing on her mind at the end of the day after all the parental and work stuff we both juggle. 

-We are hoping to have another one soonish (we'd like to have ours closer together and she's a bit older so wants to finish up sooner rather than later). 

I'm just concerned that this is it. I can look forward to nothing more than missionary sex every 3rd Sunday of the month and jerking off every morning in the shower. I even find porn a less enjoyable alternative as it reminds me of all the sex I'm not having. I thought it would get better after the first trimester, after she healed from labour, after she stopped breastfeeding, after the little one started sleeping through the night...but alas, here I am. I still find her really attractive and love her. But it's frustrating and I don't want it to fester and become a bigger issue. There have been times I have been a bit short with her and just feel like shit in general...

Long-time reader on a throwaway, here. I suffered through some LL patches, and with some effort, have come out the other side extremely satisfied. I've gone from sex a few times a year, to a few times a month, to now five+ times a week over the past few months.  
  
Here is a letter I wrote today, as if I was speaking to myself two-four years ago. Maybe it will also be a letter to myself ten months or five years from now, if things slip. Hopefully someone will find this useful. (If you're a fan of Athol Kay, you'll notice some overlap. I personally found his book instructive; but your mileage may of course vary.)

Dear Younger/Older Me,

So you look back over the past few days, weeks, months, years(?) and things are going through a bit of a dry spell. The first thing to remember is that you can't talk your way through this problem. You don't just want to have sex more, you want her to want to have sex more, right? And you can't talk someone into wanting sex more -- you have to be more attractive, on a few different levels.

Summary:

Be fit, healthy, and groomed. Contribute to beta/household stuff. Flirt during the day. Initiate sexytime at night. 

More detail comes in 4 parts:

Set-Up  
1) Long-Term  
2) Short-Term  
  
Actually Do It  
3) During the day  
4) At Night  
  
So here we go.  
  
1) Set Up Long-Term  
These are things that you may not be able to change immediately. Maybe you're already doing a lot of this, but take a moment to reflect on each point. If you notice one or two areas where, to be honest, you've been slacking, you should fix that; but you don't have to make them perfect before you get laid. It's much more important to just make a plan and take the first step in that plan, and then take another step each day. But the step is significant.

a) fitness. you should be in the best shape of your life.   
  
Imagine you went to go pick up someone at a bar or club. Could you pick up someone as hot as your partner? It's not reasonable for your partner to give you 'bonus points' for being in love with you; whatever 'bonus points' you've accumulated are counterbalanced by the boredom of seeing the same person over and over. 

Also, long-term, the fitter you are, the fitter your partner will want to be. If you get hotter and hotter, they will feel uncomfortable being the less hot one, and feel positively inspired to become a better version of themselves. So you will feel more confident, they will feel more confident, and you will both be more attracted to each other -- four ways the sex will be better.

Look at what you're eating. Re-commit to an exercise plan. read /r/fitness. Get off the couch and get sexy!
  
b) present yourself well day-to-day  
  
Wear nice clothes, groom yourself every day. Create a baseline wherein people are consistently complimenting your appearance. This is a less important but still significant version of the above. See also hygiene below.   
  
  
2) Set-Up Short-Term  
  
a) hygene  
  
sometimes, especially when things are busy, its easy to let what really should be basics slide. Give yourself some time, maybe half and hour or so, and be at your best in the following:

- trim your facial hair
- trim and clean your nails (hands and feet)
- clean up your browline
- clean hairs out of you nose and ears 
- brush and floss your teeth
- take a long, thorough shower, wash your hair
  
b) household  
  
Your partner is not going to feel super sexy if the house is a mess. Solve this problem while giving them a dose of comfort-inducing oxytocin by working the following areas:  
  
- laundry
- dishes
- pick up obvious crap throughout the house
- spend five minutes or less cleaning the bathroom

It's not hard. You shouldn't have to do this stuff in order to earn sex. At the same time, your partner should not have to share a house with and be expected to fuck someone who doesn't do 50% of the housework, right? And if they've been doing more like 75% for a while, feel free to do a little extra to make up for it. It's just sharing the load like Samwise.  
  
  
3) Actually Do It - During the day  
  
If this was someone you had just met, that you were trying to sleep with, you'd need to establish that you're interested in being more than just friends. A good way to do this is by talking about sex frankly. In your relationship, you need to keep doing this, maybe not every single day, but frequently, in order to prevent a backslide into 'just-friends-town'.

During a day in which you'd like to have sex, you need to talk about sex in a sexy way like a grown-up capable of having sex.  
    
a) flirt - in person  
  
Kiss more. She's not going to say no to a quick peck turning into a series of sexy pecks turning into a nice long deep kiss. A real kiss, especially if you are alpha about it, is going to go a long way towards getting her mind thinking about physical stuff all day.

Also, touch. Try and demonstrate how you can embody both beta and alpha (in that order) with a single long touch. 

Another thing, if you're already into a streak, up your sex by upping your alpha. tell her you're going to fuck her later. Be bold about it. Be funny and calm and casual, but tell her exactly what you're going to do and when. This works.

b) flirt - via text  
  
If this was a new lover/she was having an affair, there would probably be some racy, exiting texting. So, just be the person she's texting with.

More homey 'how is your day going?' texts are beta -- this is a *good* thing, it will show your partner that you care and value them. But you need to be 50/50 with alpha texts. Ask about her underwear, tell about a sexy thought you had, or just imply that you've been thinking dirty thoughts. Tell them about a fantasy (feel free to say, ""I had a little dream about you..."").   



4) Actually Do It - At Night  
  
This means you've put in some changes, long- and short-term. You've got her thinking about you as a sexual person. Now you need to actually make the moves and get her into bed!

Remember that she likes sex. Just because you didn't spontaneously stand up and announce ""I LOVE PIZZA"" while reading the previous paragraph, doesn't mean you don't think pizza is awesome. If someone walked into the room you're in with an amazing pizza right now, how great would that be? This is an analogy, stupid -- the point is that she really likes sex. She loves sex! She just says, ""I just don't think of it.""

Well hopefully in step 3 you made her think of it. But now its time to seal the deal.

a) be alpha (as fuck!)  
  
Being beta is a good thing. It makes her feel safe and stable. (did you do the dishes yet?) But being alpha is where you get laid. 

A good model is two guys (a guy and a girl, lets say) on a swat team or on SEAL Team Six. one guy is the field commander, one girl is one tiny notch below him in this case. They come to a door, the guy in charge decides to go left or right. Maybe if they had a debate, they would each take a side and talk it out. But in this case, its more important to just make a decision and get to the next room. If they have a formal hearing about every door, they are going to get shot. 

In other words, when it comes to trivial stuff that neither of you really cares about, it really doesn't matter if you go left or right, hamburger or mexican. She makes decisions all day. She doesn't care what we're having for dinner, probably. Give her the gift of not having to make yet another decision for someone. Give her a 10-second vacation from being assertive. It's sexy.

It's good to playfully tease her verbally. It's good to decide what and where to eat. You aren't being a tyrant, you're giving her a boner.

To take it to the next level, playfully tell her what you're going to do to her later. Tell her you're going to eat her out, tell her she's going to get a spanking. Do it playfully, but also matter-of-fact. This will work, be bold.

b) Initiate       
  
If you want a pizza, you have to pick up the phone. If your strategy for getting pizza is to not pick up the phone, as Mal says, ""that's a long wait for a train never comes."" But if the pizza guy really wanted your business, he'd call *you* and offer a pie, right?

I know I'm mixing pizza metaphors, whatever. In any case, you initiate sex. If you've planted the seeds earlier in the day and flirted at night, you are primed and ready. She expects its coming. You don't have to do a rain dance. But you do have to do *something*.

Here are two options that will work:

Kiss her. kiss her again. Kiss her a third time, but make it a real one. Kiss all over, if you want, but end on a real, lingering kiss. Then, on a scale from alpha to alpha-as-fuck, say: ""You want to head to the bedroom?"" ""We should head to the bedroom"" ""Bedtime."" or just point at the bedroom. If it's 10:00 or so, ""Bedtime"" is the magic word that will get you laid.

Did plenty of groundwork already? Been flirting all night? Skip directly to the magic word. The episode comes to an end. Which of the following great things sounds even better than the other: One more episode of Fraiser? Receiving a blowjob or kinky sex?
  
Say this word: ""Bedtime!""  
  
It's 9:45. She gets it.  
  
That is ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.  

**tl;dr: Be fit, healthy, and groomed. Contribute to beta/household stuff. Flirt during the day. Initiate sexytime at night.**

Today I decided that that was it. I simply told her we were breaking up. She was completely in shock and blamed me for not articulating what I wanted, tried to negotiate for a while if we could still work it out. We went back and forth for about two hours. She got angry and stormed off my place

No kids, Not married, No tangled finances... I guess the decision was really not that hard. I just needed the courage to call the whole thing off.

No sex for 6 months",25,6,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18032y/me_f_32him_m_34_just_found_out_why_it_hurts_dont/,"here goes.. So ive been with my SO for 8 years, first few years was great. Ive always been LL, but Ive done everything Ive can to please him anyway. Always did with others before him as well. Even if I didnt want it I still have. Sex was never about me, always about my partner.

Fast forward until 4 years ago and sex suddenly becomes painful, to the point where I cant manage to do it anymore. I should probably add in that we live together and the last time we had sex was at least 6 months ago.. due to me being LL I dont mind, I dont see the issue, but for him its a huge problem.

So I see one doctor, two doctors.. three doctors. None of them can tell me why it hurts. He starts yelling, calling me names and all sorts of things. It  becomes a daily thing him coming up with some snappy little remark about our non existent sex life and how I have two other places and two hands.. making me even less interested in doing anything at all. We barely kiss or talk to each other anymore. 

Then yesterday I went for a talk with my GP as I had to get more birth control (no idea why im still taking the bloody pill as I no longer need them) and she suggests a ten min gyno exam. While doing so she asks ""does it hurts when you have sex?"" and I start crying.. a ten minute appointment turns into me sitting there for half an hour and my GP telling me I have something called cervical ectopy that can be caused by the pill and is most likely the reason for the pain Im getting during sex. 

Now this doesnt explain my LL, but at least it explains the pain! So I rush home and cant wait to tell my SO thinking that once I get this sorted (first step get off the pill) we might be able to get at least some of our sex life back and can possibly save our relationship.

How wrong was I.. He isnt happy at all.. oh no, its just another excuse to go even longer without sex and he goes right back into the yelling and the ""if you cared about me you would at least let me stick it in your ass now and then"" routine. 

I get it, Im not easy to live with... but when I do try to give him the occasional bj he just brushes me off telling me its so long since Ive done it that I dont know what Im doing anymore. Way to ruin my confidence... 

I love him, I really do, and I do want this  to work out. Is there any way I can make him understand that yes I do have a LL, but when it comes to the pain I havnt actually made that up and now that I know what was causing it there is a way to make it go away? And how can I make him understand that these little remarks he keeps coming with is making it even worse for me to do anything with him when my LL is making it hard enough in the first place?

I am really struggling here, I dont know if I should give up or if I owe it to him to stay after all this time. Right now he is just constantly cruel, but I feel like I have been just as cruel by having refused him sex for so long.

**Update: I didnt manage to get a train yesterday as I planned, so Im leaving for the weekend in a few hours instead. Last night we not only had a fight, but sex as well as I decided to ignore the yelling and take the advice I got here that the yelling might be from built up frustration due to the long period without so I guess the six month dry spell is over.. I initiated it and I guess it went okay as I had lots of hugs and cuddles before he left this morning. The fight was mainly about me asking why he stayed with me if it was so hard for him to go without the sex while I work through this and me trying to tell him that at this point all the remarks was adding on to the problem (while still agreeing that I was the main problem and only asking that he could communicate with me by talking and not yelling and dropping these constant remarks) and he bluntly told me that he only stayed as dating would be such a hassle to go through again.

I've been married about 3 years (we're both 35).  While we were dating, we had great and frequent sex.  It slowed down a little bit once we moved in together, but definitely still great and frequent enough that it didn't bother me despite having a HL (say, 1-2/week).  My wife has struggled with depression for years, but won't go to therapy (and definitely no drugs for it).  As time went on things slowed down a bit more, but once we got married it seems like it's decreased even more.  We talked about it and she said that she was concerned about pregnancy and that it was causing her a lot of anxiety.  Seeing as how we don't want kids, we ultimately decided the best thing to do was for me to get a vasectomy.  I did so, but after I recovered this didn't seem to help at all.  It's now almost two years later and the last time we had sex was almost a year ago.  We've had ""the talk"" and she appreciates the problem, but she says she feels very unsexy and doesn't have any sex drive.

Everything else about our relationship is very good and we're very much in love still.  We enjoy each other's company, we are a good pair in all the ""big picture"" stuff.  I work full-time (and then some) and she rocks the housewife thing.  Since she left her crappy job she's lost weight and looks great.  I've kept in decent shape.  Although I work a lot, I contribute a good share of the housework by doing the stuff she really hates and when she cooks I clean.  We have a very good platonic relationship.  We go out for nice romantic nights out, etc.  I'm very affectionate verbally and physically, even when I'm not trying to get laid.  (All this comes pretty naturally to me... I was raised well.)  So all the basics should be there -- the worst one could say is that sometimes our day-to-day life gets a little routine, but we make a point of trying to break it up when we can.

The lack of sex has done a number of my own self-esteem.  I've got a good life going here, but I feel unattractive and unwanted.  Worse, if I bring up the problem it either gets dismissed or it becomes ""oh you're going to leave.""  I don't want to leave!  But my consequent porn habit is getting more than a little boring -- I don't want release, I want intimacy.   Worse, I'm a decent-looking guy and I get a bit of attention from female acquaintances and co-workers.  I have increasingly vivid fantasies about cute twenty-somethings I see daily.  They all know I'm married and so it should never go anywhere, but... well.

Having conversations with my wife about this hasn't gone anywhere good.  Her ex-husband was a dick and left her, and so if I express unhappiness her depression and anxiety combine to a bit of a firestorm.  I've learned to leave it alone as much as I can.  But that just means it bubbles up somewhere else.  For example, she'd asked if I would grow my hair and beard because she thought it was sexy, so I did for a while.  But I felt really ugly with it, and so after a year or two of that I decided to trim it all back up so at least I felt better about my appearance.  Well that blew up because she said she thought it meant I was doing it because I had something going on the side.  Which as I said, I don't.

Whether you're a LL feeling pressured constantly or a HL feeling trapped in a sexless marriage, we often hear statements like, ""as soon as the kids are grown, I'm out of here."" Or ""I'm not going to let my kids suffer the consequences of my apparently unreasonable request to have a sex life.""

So, DBers, is it better to tough it out until the kids graduate from high school and leave the nest, or is better to cut your losses and leave now, even though you have young children in the home?

I know there are lots of variables - age of children, number of children,  how well the parents get along in spite of the LL/HL issue, etc., but I'd like to know what is best for the kids.  E.g., if you could get inside your kid's head and think like them.  More specifically, if you could get inside their heads, think like them at the age they are today, and the age of adult-level understanding.

I've really struggled with this.  If a child found out as an adult that you stayed in the marriage because of them, would they be appreciative, or would they feel guilty?  Would they be thankful, or would they say, ""I wish you two would have divorced and each had a chance to be happy with someone else.""?

We dated in high school and were always very into each other both flirtatiously and sexually.  When we moved into college, I noticed our sexuality decline a bit but neither of us thought much of it.  She used to get upset about me bringing it up and say that she was not 16 anymore.

In the last year leading up our wedding, she wanted to pull back on sex to get everything situated and ordered for the wedding, also for the excitement of it. I thought this was a good idea too as it could have helped us out of our somewhat college slump.  

While the brief honeymoon was very mutually exciting and enjoyable, since then our sex life seems to be falling in tatters amongst us.  For one, she just rarely seems to really be into it.  She says that she does not really get randomly turned on during the day anymore or aroused in the same way.  The quality of our sex is also decreasing because in my head I am getting more and more worried about being awesome each time because I feel like I have to, to make her want me. 

We have been trying to talk about it but it never seems like we are communicating effectively.  She feels bad because she knows what I want and feels like she is unable to do/give it.  This boggles my mind as all I want is her and I do not understand why its so difficult for her to want me to.

It fucking sucks because all I want to do is be the best husband to her and provide everything for her, which I would think/hope would include that. This situation makes me feel un-appreciated and un-needed. At the same time, I know that I need perfect sex to be a part of my marriage and that she does too.

21M/21F. First off, a sincere thank you to everyone who was kind enough to offer advice and a big fuck you to those of you harassing and belittling me. 

Second, I'm cured! 

Before getting engaged, my husband and I spoke about everything. Our future, finances, children, housing, families, religion, and of course, sex. While all of our goals and expectations lined up perfectly, sex was a little off. 

Ideally, we wanted to have sex once a week for the rest of our lives (this is minimal; more would be great, less would be concerning). However I was having trouble being intimate out of what seemed like no where. 

The way he spoke about sex made me feel like I wasn't good enough for him, even though we were doing what we agreed would be good. He'd joke in front of friends how I never gave him a blowjob (untrue) or how we had no sex life because we were going to be married (still untrue). This along with my anxiety because of the wedding planning and work getting unreasonably stressful (got a new, better paying job since then) made me not even want to think about sex. It became a problem. It wasn't beautiful or intimate, it was just another problem I had. Every little thing I could find wrong with it, I found.

After we had a serious discussion about everything, it completely changed. It was a ridiculously fast change, too! We have sex a minimum of twice a week now and it's great. 

To everyone who told me it was anxiety related: you're fucking awesome. I definitely knew this but so many people made me think ""anxiety isn't real"" so I don't even consider it as a possibility. I've always been rather anxious (and that's actually something I'm still working on with nothing but success so far).

We still don't have any relationship issues other than sometimes being a little crabby; and all problems are still addressed as OUR problems. I'm very thankful to have a marriage with such incredible communication and understanding.

Oh, and our wedding was beautiful too :).

I realize I may get some judgment for this, which I probably deserve, but maybe I need a good slap in the face.

I (F26) have been in a ""dead bedroom"" relationship for over two years (our entire marriage and then some). My SO (M32) grew up in a non-affectionate environment which has carried over into adulthood; consequently there is little physical intimacy in our relationship. There have been a host of other issues, but this has been the biggest, as I'm a very physical person. I had hoped it would improve after we got married, and I tried my best to facilitate a more intimate relationship, but nothing seemed to work. I lost weight. I changed my hair. I bought lingerie, toys, lubes, you name it. I offered BJs/HJs/anal/etc. I played hard-to-get. I cried, I begged, I pleaded. About 6 months ago I had a major blow-up (dangerously close to a nervous breakdown), told him that I felt unloved and under-appreciated, and issued an ultimatum: either the situation improves, or I walk. In the heat of the moment he apologized and told me he would work on it, but soon enough went back to his usual MO. I felt awful. I was so tired of being rejected that I started detaching myself emotionally from the situation, and mentally preparing myself for the possibility of separation and divorce. I didn't eat, I barely slept, and I went out of my way to not spend time with him.

A few anxious &amp; depressed months later, he seems to have finally gotten it through his head that this is a serious situation. The realization that he may lose me over this has made him start trying to do better. Not by much, but he is at least acknowledging that there's an issue, which is a big step. The problem is, it may be too little too late. 

A few weeks ago, something I'd always considered unthinkable happened. I cheated on him. As someone who had been cheated on in a previous relationship, I thought I would NEVER do that to someone else. Now I'd like to go back in time just to tell myself ""never say never."" It was a one-time thing, and I haven't told him yet. I know when I do it will be the end. The way he talks about other people he's known who have cheated makes me fairly sure of that.

I want to tell him, and I'm going to. I just don't know when or how. To wrap it up, the tl;dr version is: involved in a DB relationship, became depressed &amp; detached, cheated, now SO wants to work on things but doesn't know I cheated. Wondering where to go from here.

While I am not in a deadbedroom, i feel like the writing is on the wall. Im 30 years old. Ive been married for 3 years and with my wife for about 8 (no kids). Id LOVE some insight from those of you with more worldly experience. I dont have anyone to confide with in person. 

My wife and I have sex about 1-2 times a week on average. So, while there is some life to our bedroom, I am miserable. I know some of you who have been dry for months will look at me and laugh, but I appreciate any insight regardless. If it was up to her, we'd have sex 1-2 times per month. The sex that we do have is mostly obligatory sex from her (which is dull and repetitive). 

Over the past 4 years, our sex life has gone from fun and spontaneous, to dull and boring. Ive had an intense sex drive for as long as I can remember. I thrive on new experiences and exploration. Im open to just about anything. My wife has continued to get duller and duller. We have gotten to the the point where she only likes 1 position. She isnt crazy about foreplay. She needs porn to stay focused. She doesnt love me going down on her (which i love). BJs are gone (her jaw hurts). Kissing is gone (other than pecks). Basically, our sex is like watching the same episode of Seinfeld over and over. There is no variation. It was fun once and better than nothing, but its the same thing constantly. 

She used to be fun and kinky when we dated, but she has admitted that she only did that stuff to 'keep me around'. I cant help but feel like Ive been a victim of a 'bait and switch'. 

She is lower libido and I finally stopped making excuses for her (in my head) on why she wasnt attracted to me or wanting me anymore. I try to initiate, but I almost always get shot down bc shes tired, has a headache, etc. There is always *something*. I really feel beat-up from all of the rejection over the years. Every time i try to touch her or change anything, she makes this face.. the I dont like that face. It can kill my hard-on in 5 seconds. Im sure some of you have seen it before with your partners.

We dont have kids. She is begging for them. Ive told her that Im not comfortable with where our relationship is at to bring a kid into the equation. I guess Im at the 'shit or get off the pot' point with the relationship.

I feel guilty being so hung up on sex.. but its more than just sex. I miss the connection. I miss having fun in the bedroom. I miss being close and intimate with her. Ive told her this countless times, but I know it wont get better. This is what it will be, and I can only imagine that kids will make it worse. She is a great spouse otherwise.. not perfect, but who is? So, Im on edge with the idea of throwing out a decent marriage.. but at the same time, I know i cant live another 60 years without being sexually fulfilled.

So I've had a bit of a read around this subreddit and most of these posts seem to be about people who are the 'victims' of DB and the majority of the advice here is ""get the fuck out of the relationship"". Fair enough. I probably wouldn't even argue with most of those comments. 

However, I thought I'd mention my own experiences and just some things that have played a part in the way things are now. Note, it has nothing to do with chores or doing anything around the house (which seems to be quite the focus here).

**I have tried to bold the main points to help you guys read through this.**

Some general points. I am female, 24 years old. I have been in a relationship for about 4 years.

When I first started going out with my bf, I was really really excited (as everyone usually is). I thought he was the one. I thought he was amazing. I had some issues with intimacy and sex, but I was really hoping on working on them. The issues were things like, me not being too comfortable with initiating physical contact and sex was very painful. 

A side note, **in my previous relationship **(also of approx 4 yrs) I was with a guy and ** we hardly had sex (this was in my teens). We did however do everything up to that very often. He gave me a lot of positive feedback and I felt very positive about myself and my abilities. ** He never complained about us not actually having sex, because we were doing everything else. We would make out for ages, to the point of slowly falling asleep in eachother's arms (even though I had to go home each night). It was just easy. I wasn't too affectionate in public, but our sexual life was quite ok to be honest. The reason we broke up was because of us just going separate ways and not being very compatible. Sexually, we were compatible however.

Anyway, back to the current relationship. I had imagined (maybe even fantasised) having sex with this guy. I was really excited. But then, a number of things happened. It is best that I summarise it:

- First 6-12 months we were very happy with eachother. However, I was very insecure in this relationship. he had mentioned on the side things like ""I don't want to settle down with the first girl I meet (being me""
- **He couldn't get it up the first time we tried to have sex with a condom. He couldn't get hard when I touched him. He couldn't stay hard even if he did get hard at first. He couldn't get hard even if I tried to give him a BJ. My self-esteem absolutely plummeted. Very quickly. **
- We tried things here and there, but I **lost my confidence** and motivation to try new things. I ended up having to go on the pill (very much against what I wanted) just so he could keep it up during sex (condoms were out of the question).
- I had problems initiating physical contact before. but now this issue grew enormously. I did not want to reach out and touch him, in fear he would lose it. 
- after a huge fight, he told me **he didn't find me that attractive**. he said dead serious, straight into my eyes, and even elaborated on which physical ""defects"" he didn't like. 

This went on for a while... 4 years later, I am unable to break free of what happened in the past. These problems went on for maybe 1 or 2 years. Then it kind of went away, as he lost a bit of his anxiety about it. 

**But, I no longer wanted to get intimate**. I no longer wanted to do any foreplay. I just wanted to get it over and done with. It felt unnatural. It felt like a **chore**. I started counting how often we had sex. he started counting and saying things to me once in a while about how often we have it. 

He decided he's going to let me initiate ""when i want it"". This made things worse because I was already having trouble initiating and I felt like none of these issues got resolved.

Now I'm at a point where I don't want to get into bed. Once I get into bed, I am feeling **incredibly anxious** about my ""duty"" and how the last time we had sex was this many days ago. 

I have tried to tell him. **He has tried to not pressure me**. But I know what he is thinking. And I have no self esteem left. **I wake up in the morning angry and irritated because I feel guilty and incapable. I go to sleep annoyed, frustrated, stressed (because I had to do so many things before getting into bed and I don't have much time to try and psyche myself up for it).**

**I am constantly feeling guilty, stressed, anxious**. I cannot move on from what happened, because I see these symptoms from him even now if I try anything. I give up too quickly. I know. But I wasn't the type of person that could handle so much negative feedback. 

and now i'm stuck. and** I can't convey these issues to him because he tells me that things have changed now and that I should let go of the past. But he cannot understand that this past has shaped a lot of my habitual reactions to him now. **

I've realised this is a massive rant, and I am not defending my actions and many of you would tell me to go see a psych. And yes I have tried, numerous ones. I am just in a state of absolute agitation and anxiety over it.

looking forward to your responses. Good luck reading this post.

tl;dr my bf's sexual issues and negative feedback have led to my incredibly low self esteem and motivation to do anything in bed.

My girlfriend and I (both 21 now) have been together for 2 years now. The sex started off amazing (we were both virgins) almost every time we saw each other, often twice or three times a day for a few months. Then it slowly declined until now, where its once a month if i'm lucky. She is on birth control which i think is doing it (this is her 5th one, all the others effected her MUCH worse) and because of a fear of health risks refuses to even consider an IUD.

She is a very reserved person when it comes to sex. She doesn't like to talk about it, nor does she like to tell me what she wants which leaves me guessing. I on the other hand am very sexual. I have tried everything i can think of, for a while i had good success initiating during a back-rub that would turn sexual, but now even that fails to get her in the mood. 

I think the issue is that i am too 'over-affectionate'. I love this woman to death and i see myself spending the rest of my life with her, but the lack of sex is really starting to effect me. I am always doing things for her, giving backrubs, footrubs, making her feel beautiful and wanted, i feel like lately i am doing everything for her and getting nothing back. Its killing me. Every time she doesn't want sex i feel its my fault. Its been killing my self esteem, i feel like shit, i'm frustrated, and sometimes it makes me downright mad. Then to make it worse, i feel bad for getting so upset over sex, everything else in the relationship is perfect, and every time i think i might want to end it because of this i feel like a giant douchebag.

When we do have sex she loves it. She always (semi-jokingly) says ""why don't we do this more often"". I spend much more time on her than i give to myself, in hopes that she will want it more. But nothing ever works. She sometimes likes to promise sex later or we will sometimes plan a day (our schedules can sometimes get hectic) but as that day comes around she is not into it. It's an awful emotional rollercoaster and it is making me feel more and more like shit every day.

My final option is to attempt to be less affectionate. I'm not going to initiate sex any more, i wont ask/suggest/anything. If this doesn't work i think i might have to end it.

Almost everything in the relationship has been way better than it was before... except sex.
One of her complaints of our old relationship was that sex was far in between (once a week) and with little variety. She wanted to experiment, use toys, new positions, new places... Now, after a year or so of this new stage of our relationship, and with our wedding closing in, that person is gone.
It's always me who has to initiate everytime, and she constantly rejects me. Now we are down to about once a month... and when we do have sex is plain old missionary or doggy until it's over.
Has anyone been on this situation before? We've had *the talk*. And she says she feels ""lazy"" about sex.

We've had ""the talk."" I feel like I'm constantly trying to work every single thing about myself to make myself a better person and to let her feel supported and loved ... I feel like I'm ""doing the do"" the best I know how ... but some days I just want to say ""Fuck it. I don't need this noise"" ... give up and find someone new.

If she isn't in love with me the way I'm in love with her, why the fuck should I keep jumping through all these hoops.

I get it. Now instead of sex every 12 weeks or so, it's sex every 4 weeks or so. We're ""making progress.""

Passion? maybe ... sometimes ... here's some compassion, though. Does that help?

I'm tired of being jealous and frustrated. I'm tired of never knowing if she is sending me a signal that maybe tonight's the night ... I'm tired of hearing all the many ways she can think of to say ""no"" ... I just want to vomit every time she talks about a headache, or bleeding down there or feeling irritated, or sad ... or early morning ... or whatever ... I'm tired of sacrificing time and energy into building intimacy and closeness to just be her snuggle buddy.

I love laughing with her. I love to make her laugh. I love sharing our hopes and dreams and fears and lives. I love being a parent together with her and muscling my schedule around to make quality time ...

But at some point it just feels like I'm filling a bucket with a big hole in it.

I need passion. I need to be needed the way I need her.

I don't know how long ""progress"" can continue at this rate.

It feels like I am doing all this work, and I am happy to be a better man and a better husband, and ... I am not doing this just to get laid ... I really do want to be a better man ... But at some point I need to get laid, and I can get laid.  ...

I go to a party and I see some girl I met a few weeks ago across the crowd ... she's asking a friend if *I'm* there while she's hiking up her hemline and shuffling down her neckline. Or meeting a new woman who is enthralled in our conversation, cheeks flushed, eyes wide ... her hand moving with a strange frequency to my arm ... and then the look of disappointment on her face when she sees my wedding ring.

... meanwhile knowing the woman I devote my life to barely sees me as a sexual creature at all. It hurts.

Why am I so fucking jealous? I can't help it. I try to help it. I am doing everything I can. I can't open all the doors. I can't make her love me. I can't make her be in love with me. I can't hold hands and stroke hair and hug forever. **I need more than this**

... in some sense, there will always be a longing for something more ... for something better ...

We give up the hope of having some of that stuff when we get married ... I understand that. But I don't think we have to surrender as much as it feels like I've had to for this.

I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of shaking. I'm tired of planning things out and having nothing but a stack of dashed hopes. I'm tired of walking through rituals that suck passion out of sex only to half the time end up falling asleep on the couch ... again. I'm tired of lying in bed alone. I'm tired of never knowing if you are manipulating me subconsciously or deliberately. I'm tired of you giving me just enough not to leave. Do you want to talk about control and emotional abuse? Do you really want to talk about what is happening here?

She actually came to me and had a talk, she said she understands why I am angry at her, however me treating her like she didn't exist was just torturing her. She said she missed hugs from me and connecting with me and everything else. I was going to wait until Friday but it seemed like a good time to bring it up. i wasn't treating her bad, I guess I just didn't know how to act around her, I felt like I was deceiving her by not saying anything.

Thats when I said ""I am moving out and we should end it""  She kept saying Please give me another chance, at first I was strong and said ""No, it wouldn't matter anyway"" however gradually I gave in. She said she though she had time to work on it, however she knows now it has to happen now. She kept pleading for one more chance and I faltered.

I am not sure that even if she picked up her game 100% if it would matter but I suppose for history sake I am willing to give that to her.  However it will be a week by week scenario now, if it lacks for a week (Within reason) I will walk.  I am not going to let her know that.  I don't want her to put on a nice act for two months and then drop it off.   

If she is serious about fixing it her effort should last more than two weeks. She is currently sick so once that heals I guess I start the stopwatch.

I'd be turned down 99% of the time, almost always be the initiator, and be told that he's just too stressed/tired/headache/not in the mood. 

Well yesterday I had a surprise. At 3am we finally went to bed after some stressful, unrelated conversations (that late on a Monday night, I knew I had not chance so didn't try). He shocked me by initiating. Not only did he initiate, but he was passionate about it and didn't just follow the standard routine. Knowing that he clearly wanted it, helped me to enjoy it more (it's just not a turn on to have to beg for sex), and it was good sex! I was so shocked and happy, I couldn't stop smiling afterwards. 

I made sure to tell him afterwards that it was good and I liked the new things he'd tried. He asked what specifically I liked and I told him. So hopefully I'll be seeing more of those moves.

This may only be a blip on the radar, or a planned response to my (what I thought was hidden) upset on Saturday and Sunday nights, but I'm holding onto hope that maybe things are turning around. It was genuinely fun sex with a bit of experimentation. If he enjoyed it as much as me, maybe he'll want to do it again soon.

So, I just wanted to share this glimmer of hope. I spent the weekend crying and Monday smiling. Don't know what's coming next, but it could be good things around the corner.

The other thing to note is that I've become a bit bitter during this whole thing. Our relationship has become a lot of complaining to each other, and I'd been focused on what I wasn't getting. Yesterday evening, I somehow shifted my focus and made several clear attempts to give more: paying more attention to him during conversation, responding empathetically instead of judgmentally, telling him I want to plan something nice for him. I don't know whether it's connected to the result I got, but I'm going to try more of this active niceness and giving, since it'll definitely improve the relationship.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_va2md,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/va2md/update_just_got_turned_down_again/,

Now sex hasn't improved much and even her scheduling which she set at 2x a week just hasn't happened.  It's usually once every 3 weeks and well it is pretty boring sex and I couldn't be bothered with it any more. 

I think about breaking up with her every single day, then I think of how compatible we are and always go oh I should see how it is in another 3 weeks, or I will wait until it hits 6 weeks without however I feel like that is just prolonging the pain.  I see this problem only getting worse with time not better.  She says it is because of stresses with her job but this has been an issue for 2 years and yes we are living at her parents house currently she thinks buying a house will fix all our issues.  These problems were before she got the job and before we sold my place and moved into her parents.

It may or may not improve things but since I have a significant amount of money involved(basically I can buy a decent house outright) it is not a chance I am willing to take.

However where I feel bad is that I feel like I have just wasted her time.  She wants kids before 30 and well I don't think that is possible without me. I honestly feel like me leaving will destroy her and I feel absolutely terrible for doing it.

I was after some advice,  how should I go about this if I do?  I currently live with her family and get along great.  I worry about my will to go through it when I see her hurting.  Should I take a day off work and pack all of my clothes and then do it suddenly, coming back later for the big items?  Should I tell her family of my plans first?  

I guess I could stay at my dad's for awhile, I don't know how receptive he would be for that and I would probably have to pay huge amount of rent to do it. I don't really know anyone else who is in a position to put me up until I get back on my feet.

We have had sex more times in the past few weeks then we had in the past year. As a result we're both a lot happier. I know its still early days, but things are looking up.
It really did come down to communication. I've always been shy in bed until we 'get going' and he always initiated. He stopped initiating due to gaining a few kg due to stress at work. I assumed he didnt want it anymore so I never pushed for it, because I never initiated he thought i didnt want it. 
So after far too long we had a chat, I told him I find him sexy, but, if his extra weight I'd help him get back into shape. He thought I didnt love him anymore because I never pursued sex. That was the wake up call. I decided then and there to lose some inhibition or I could possibly lose him. So I've been acting out all the things ive wanted to do, but held back. 
Well.. it's been pretty mind blowing. We promised each other to never get back to where we were. Just be honest and talk it out. It is hard for me. Ive always held back and felt the words I wanted to say on the tip of my tongue, or when wanting to initiate I procrastinated for so long in fear of being tuned down. But not saying anything will end up worse then being turned down, from anger at the situation I turned passive aggressive and took my frustrations out on him in other ways.

My wife just told me that she would be happy ""never having sex again"". I am devastated and I don't know what to do.


One week ago I tried to initate some intimacy/sexy time with my wife after a TV show we watch together had ended as we were sitting on the couch snuggling and watching TV wile she was wearing a sexy camisole/thong set that I had asked her to put on earlier in the evening. She rebuffed my advance (kissing her neck softly and asking her if she would like to go to the bedroom) by telling me that she would be happy ""never having sex again"" (her exact words). I was devestated, my bottom lip hit the floor and I stared dumbly at her for 30 seconds. After talking about it she told me that she no longer has any desire to have sex with me or anyone else. She says that she finds me attractive but that she no longer feels sexual desire or gets horny. When I ask questions along the line of having her explain why she feels this way I am repeatedly told that she ""doesn't know why she feels like this"". She denies any past history of sexual assault. 


She has since cut off any sexual activities and gets openly hostile when I try to initiate. This is the culmination of a slow decline in intimacy in our marriage over the past few years. I am 33 she is 34 We have 3 children together all under 4years old and she is at home on a maternity leave while I work full time Mon-Fri. When we were dating she was full of passion and put effort into making love. She is multi orgasmic and would normally have 5-10 orgasms every time we had sex. I have never had any erectile or performance issues.


When we were making babies we were having sex twice a day until she discoved that she was pregnant, then it rapidly fell off. Since the last baby was born I tried initiating sex again after she had healed up from the delivery to limited success. She was not putting in any effort and after masturbating herself with my cock inside her in the missionary position we would then switch to doggy style until she orgasmed again and then told me to finish up quickly.


I assist with housework and child rearing a considerable amout (much more than many other husbands I know) but I could be doing more in this regard (ie waiting on them hand and foot and taking no time for myself).


In the last month she has starting spending all of her free time playing facebook games and watching television shows to the exclusion of anything else. She has a passion for playing a particular sport and will be starting this month one night a week playing it on a local recreational team.


I do not suspect her of cheating on me and have never cheated or could cheat on her. I was cheated on once by a past girlfriend and know how devestating it feels. She in not on birth control and has not been on the pill for years. Birth control has been managed surgically since the birth of our last baby. I have asked her to attend marriage counceling with me and she has agreed, we are currently trying to get something booked. I have shared with her that this attitude towards sex will probably result in the end of our marriage without significant progress in the next 2 years.


I do not understand why she has chosen to deny me the love and closeness that I need from sexual intimacy with her.


AMA or provide advice please. This situation has made me terribly depressed and I am willing to do anything and put in enormous effort to resuming a healthy relationship with her.


She posted this almost 2 years ago : [I have no sex drive - how do I get it back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d53dc/i_have_no_sex_drive_how_do_i_get_it_back/)

Since then things have become way worse, honestly we didn't really follow thru with anything on the list with the exception of me doing more housework and putting more effort into taking the kids so she could have time off more often.

I love her more than life itself and this is killing me. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope. Crossposted to  /r/deadbedrooms and /r/relationship_advice

Talking about the fact that my marriage has only seen sex a handful of times in the last few years is difficult and there's a certain humiliation factor that prevents me from bringing this topic up with my friends.

I have been married for 5 years, and our bedroom has seen little to no action in the last 3.5 years. The first year we were married we had sex at least 3 or 4 times a week. I read stories around here with people complaining about only having sex once a month. Let me just say that I would be a very happy person if me and my husband had sex that often. I would like to have it more (i.e. I could have it every day!), but I could settle for once a month for the rest of the my life and be mostly fulfilled. In the last 3.5 years we have had sex only a few times.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not an unattractive person at all. There is room for improvement, I'm sure, but that's the case with everyone. I haven't let myself go since we got married. People wanted me before I was married and I know that if I were on the market today I would have no trouble getting action if I wanted it. I don't feel my physical appearance is really the issue.

I feel stuck between a rock and hard place in this situation because I love my husband very much. I don't want an open marriage, I have no desire to have sex with anyone aside from my husband. My sex drive and my love for him are very much interconnected and it's him who I want to have sex with. It's him who I want to touch and him who I want to make love to.

I ask for sex often and am rejected 99% of the time. He gets agitated if I ask too frequently, and he gets agitated if I try to pry and figure out reasons why he doesn't want to have sex. I know he looks at porn and presumably masturbates with some regularity, which I have no problem with at all, half because I'm glad he's getting some sexual release when he needs it and half because it gives me some sign that his libido isn't completely dead.

I am good to him. I do my best to take care of him and do my best to try and create ""sparks"" in our marriage by going on dates and stuff. I bought some massage oil the other day so that I could give him a massage or two, now and then, to ease his stress. When I brought it home he told me that he ""didn't like massages"" because they made him sore. Made me feel kind of defeated.

On the rare occasion I will get him to agree to have sex on a future day (i.e. in a few days). This actually ends up being more painful for me than an outright rejection because in the day leading up to our planned sex, he begins his performance of, ""Wow, I'm not feeling that great today."" or, ""Oh boy, am I ever tired."" and I know when he starts rolling out those statements that we won't be having sex that night. On some sex date occasions he'll mention his tiredness so often I'll tell him, ""Ok, I get it. We're not having sex!"" ... which is kind of funny, if only it weren't so sad. It's almost as if when my sex drive is high he is living in a constant state of fear that I will be asking for sex and he knows that he cannot or does not want to engage in it with me.

It definitely comes and goes in cycles. Some weeks my sex drive is kind of low, so I don't bug him about it at all and am not feeling my usual disappointment about not having sex. But other times, like now, my sex drive is insane. I feel like I could have sex 24x7. This is obviously when it is hardest for me to deal with and when the rejection hurts my self esteem the most. I almost wish I didn't have a sex drive so that we were both on the same page in not wanting it.

Outside of the fact that we have a dead bedroom, we make each other surprisingly happy. We don't fight much, we talk a lot (just not about sex), spend most of our time together when we aren't working, and have a lot in common. I guess that's the thing. Since we otherwise get along and make each other happy, not having sex is not enough of a reason for me to leave the marriage.

I am going to keep on figuring out ways to create that ""spark"" that I am looking for in our marriage:

- I'm working on keeping myself healthy and attractive.

- I'm supporting him in his efforts to be healthy and attractive. I know that he often feels like a bit of a ""slob"", though I think he's gorgeous. When I tell him that he says, ""Yeah, but we're married so you're supposed to say that."" and I usually reply with, ""Maybe, but the fact that I want to have sex with you every day is probably proof enough that I think you're hot""

- I'm trying to communicate to him that I am open to ""anything"". Maybe this guy wants something in the bedroom and just can't bring himself to ask me.

- We don't watch porn together but I think it's something that I'm going to encourage. I'm not totally confident that he'll want to do that, but maybe it will make for a ""sexy"" mood in the bedroom. 

And if none of that works...

I guess I'll have little choice but to settle for the sexless marriage thing. Like I said, we're otherwise happy and I love the guy and want to spend the rest of my life with him, sex or no sex.

We have sex a couple of nights a week (I've told her that anything less than this is a big problem for me). Every time it's the same thing: she comes out of the shower, lays down on the bed, and waits for me to do my thing. There is never, and I mean NEVER, any initiative taken. There's never any spontaneity, either. If I do something that might turn her on outside of the bedroom, she tells me to stop, because she doesn't want to get turned on. Even if the kids are already in bed, she won't let anything happen outside the planned time, inside the bedroom. She's willing to have sex on the couch, or in the garage, or whatever, I mean she's willing. But it has to be planned, and orchestrated by me.

We've argued about this so much, I've come to a dead end with it. I can't make her want to do anything she doesn't want to do, but I want her to be a sex PARTNER, not a servant. Do I have a right to expect her to take initiative with sex? I am VERY unhappy, and just don't know what else to do.

I took the lace bra/panties and garter strap off, changed into granny panties and a cami, and went to sleep instead of waiting up any longer.

I have been mad since then.  Like, to the point of the relationship outside the bedroom being affected, I don't want him to touch me or even talk to me.  

Up to this point I've been good about it outside the bedroom, he's always tired or sick or whatever the fuck his excuse has been, and I have been calm about discussing it and accepting his promise to try harder to make time and priority for sex.  I have been trying so hard to keep up the intimacy in other ways and not put too much pressure on him.

But seriously?  I can't help but push him away today, I have been flat out rejecting all attempts to even be my friend, I don't want to see his fucking face right now.  I am miserably horny and he doesn't fucking care, and I am trying so hard to come up with the reasons for staying together.  Everything but this has been fine and we have a son together.  But I'm not sure how long I can put up with sex once every few weeks, we're barely two years in, I'm still in my 20s, I could possibly move on if we end this shit now.  I just don't know how else to make it crystal clear to him that SEX MATTERS TO ME.

I really need to vent.  But also, wtf do I do here?  I am starting to straight up HATE his ass over this.  At what point does this stop being worth it?

1324833569.0,17,self.DeadBedrooms,nq9wh,Cured?,20,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/nq9wh/cured/,"I apologize in advance for the length, Reddit, but I had to tell someone. My wife and I have been married for 14 years and for the last 7 or 8, we have had sex on average once every month to month and a half. Sometimes dry spells go much longer. The hardest part for me is that simple affection seems to be off the table. All I get are hugs and occasional pecks. 

For the last several months, we have been fighting a lot. she has lots of problems with me (mostly related to my ADD) while I just want some affection in my marriage. Anyway, arguments have revolved around how to ""fix"" the other person so that we can both be happy and have been contentious and emotional. A week ago, we discussed separating. The big turning point came when we realized that we both felt a sense of relief at the idea, not despair. We decided to separate but not to make any rash decisions, just let it sink in for a few days to make sure it was the right decision. 

That's where it got weird. We started having conversations about how we'd work out our post-marriage lives, who we'd date, how we would raise the kids, finances, etc. The conversations became calm, supportive, and rational. This went on for a few days and all of a sudden a little tenderness crept back in. Then I kissed her one day and it felt like a first kiss. That night I held her and it led to more. 

Then, on top of those feelings, she all of a sudden assessed her position. It suddenly occurred to her that she's approaching 40, has two kids, a low sex drive, and is incredibly picky about who she'll date. While my prospects are pretty good (lots of single moms in the area and I like kids), hers are not so great. She decided that her chances of finding anyone are kind of low, her finding anyone she’d be okay with are very low, and her chances of finding anyone as good as me are almost nonexistent. 

On top of this, it also occurred to her that I had been quite clear about wanting to leave her. All three of those factors teamed up in her head to kick in some sort of primal keep-my-man impulse and a strong sex drive appeared from nowhere and along with it a strong desire to stoke its flames. Let’s put it this way: In the 16 years we have been together, we have had sex twice in one day only once. A few days ago, we did it three times.

So, will it last? I don’t know. I doubt it will stay this strong for more than a couple of weeks. But if it settles somewhere between the two, I will be a happy, happy man. So stay strong, my friends. It could just get better.

TL;DR Wife and I decided to split up, wife decided she can’t do better, and has become insatiable all of a sudden.

Over that time, the frequency of sex with my wife has only occasionally been adequate.  Most of the time my advances are refused, which led to me having feelings of unattractiveness and inadequacy.  

Let me make myself clear, I love my wife dearly, and we get along on pretty much every other level.  I would never consider leaving her now.  At the same time, I do have to think of myself to some degree.  If I'm that unhappy, things aren't going to go well.

I had my first affair about 4 years after we were married.  Suddenly this other woman thought I was attractive and loved having sex with me.  It's hard to express how wonderful that felt after years of being without it.  Since then, I've had affairs with about 6 women over the years.  

It's not a constant thing, but I will say that when I'm having an affair, I'm a better person overall for it.  I'm more efficient at work, I spend more quality time with my family, and I'm just happier.  I feel attractive and much more confident overall.  Even ""online only"" type affairs where I never have physical contact with the person can make me feel much better about myself.


If you decide to have an affair, keep some things in mind.

  
*  Don't hide the fact that your married from the person you're sleeping with.


*  No public displays of affection with your affair.  


*  Don't mislead your affair into thinking you will leave your SO for them.


*  Safe sex, always.

We had been dating for two years. She started IDing as asexual during the relationship, would still try to have sex with me even though she didn't like it because she wanted to make me happy, which was kind but also disturbing to me because she was very rarely turned on, she never looked at me below the neck. I got her to orgasm a couple times but she usually made me stop once she got close because it was too intense, and then she would cry. She wouldn't go down on me because she thought it was gross, washed her hands after because she thought getting wet was gross, etc. 

I was planning on staying because I loved her, and we were really good at the core relationship stuff—respecting boundaries, communicating, working out who does what chore, etc. We were both kind to each other but we didn't really like doing the same stuff out of the bedroom, either, which made it easier to make the decision. I was talking with a counselor and they asked me if I was happy, and I wasn't, I was miserable, the counselor said I shouldn't stay in a relationship just because I liked the other person, that's when I knew. And she was miserable too by the end, she didn't feel like I really appreciated her. And I didn't, I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with her, I started thinking of it as something I would need to grit my teeth and get through to keep her happy instead of something that I genuinely wanted.

So, I ended it, and I've felt like a weight's been lifted off my chest since that day. I'm currently banging a lesbian couple I know who wanted a third for FWB-type-activities and they think I'm hot as hell which is really comforting on top of awesome, working on myself and my life, etc.

Ok, I'm getting a little annoyed with this. (41F) I'm married to (M37) for the last 10 years, together for 12. We have 3 children, the youngest is only 8 months old. I'm breastfeeding him and he's very, very attached to me.



We have pretty infrequent sex due to my being very wrapped up with the baby and kids and he falls asleep very early (by 8:30) because he works in the hot sun all day at a pretty physical job. The kids are still up by the time he's fast asleep. I would like more sex, but I'd also like time to have more sex! We've been surviving off off quickies when we can grab them but thats it, no intimacy, cuddling, or focus on me for a while, just wham bam thank ya ma'am (which is mostly OK with me, I like it fast and hard too) but we never have time to ""make love"". The last time we did, his mother came over to watch the kids and we went to her house and had awesome sex/lovemaking in his old bed. It was amazing and I personally want more of that kind of sex...although I know its rare. That was about a month ago, and that was the last time he got a BJ.


So now just a few minutes ago I was texting with him and I mentioned how we havent had sex in 5 days and how he must be ready to burst. He says, ""I thought you were saving it up to give me a great blowjob.""
Idk why but this pissed me off. Not, ""I miss you babe, being close with you, making love"" just pretty much, ""woman its time to service your man!""


Do men ever consider that unlike the bullshit world of porn, women cant cum giving you a blowjob? Its sexy, erotic, it turns us on and then ""pop"" the man is done and the woman is left hanging. Now, if I knew he'd reciprocate I'd be more willing to do it. I have too much shit to do to deal with added sexual frustration. If BJs were totally normal and natural to give and receive than I could cum with my mouth and dicks would taste like chocolate! Personally, I think he's looking at porn and wants what he's seeing in porn. He even got pissed and said, ""I guess this is married life! No blowjobs!""


No, dick! This is life with three kids! If we get time for sex I want to get off too, selfish asshole!I told him to get a divorce and buy himself a blowjob! (no, I didnt really mean it...exaggeration)

She started texting with a friend while I tried to talk about her day, my day, and even what was going on on TV. I pulled her in, tried to cuddle and what not but she was wholly unresponsive. This went on for about an hour before I said - ""If you could be just a little bit more responsive that would help me out a great deal."" She said it felt like there was no romance, like I was just trying to have sex with a woman and she just happened to be there. Sigh. I gave up at this point and went to bed.

She followed and this lead to a discussion. She said she wanted to feel romanced, like the way we used to do when we were first dating. I said I felt the same way and talked about why the armpit hair thing bothered me (for whatever reason, she didn't remember having taken care of it when we first started dating). I also told her that I knew she snooped through my phone and I didn't appreciate it. Not so much the invasion of privacy, but more - I'd rather that time/energy be spent towards us and not worried about what I may or may not be doing. She seemed to understand what I was trying to say. 

Long story short, no sex that night but we ended the conversation on a fairly good note. I've got some more sexy indie movies I've rented so we're going to have movie night tonight and hopefully that leads to an encounter.

Update: So we spoke on the phone about all of this and I told her that I'm having a lot of difficulty waiting until marriage (which we've forecasted at 2-3 years from now = 8 years of no sex ... just typing that out made me uncomfortable). I told her that it makes me feel rejected, and she kept saying it was a choice she made and she would feel disappointed in herself if she gave in and could see herself blaming me for it, which would upset her if she became like that. 

I then explained to her that it's not just the idea of mechanical penetration, it's the idea of sex as an expression of love. 
I then tried to explain how this rejection feels, and that it's not 
just the idea of penetration, it's her perspective and attitude about sex, 
and her lack of initiative. She admits that I've complained about her initiative before, and she says she tried to initiate a few times, but she really likes when I do and so she fell behind. I told her that it's honestly really difficult to keep initiating because I feel like she's not even interested in it.

I then asked her why was she trying to put me inside her, and she said that she wanted to see if things would work, and she was worried that I won't fit (the 'mechanics'), and she thought I would get pleasure from that. This bothered me because I never asked for this, and I've only told her that I'm worried about her doing that  and that she shouldn't be doing that if it's hurting her. In fact I asked her what was she expecting out of it, and how would she have reacted if suddenly one day I was able to go in all the way. I told her that I really misinterpreted this as that she wanted to start trying to have sex, and I honestly feel led on. She apologized for that.

I then asked her about why she always pushes me away when I try to go down/finger her. She said she likes the idea of me cumming first because she feels like when she cums her body gets too sensitive and she gets ticklish if I touch her, etc. I asked her what exactly is wrong with that, and how would that impede bringing me to orgasm. And I guess she tried to bring that to ""well what's wrong with you cumming first?"". 

I then explained to her she always pushes me away when I try to bring her to orgasm after I cum, which she first denied but I stuck to it that she really does this more than she realizes. She responded by saying she didn't know if I was doing it just to make her cum or if I actually liked it. This bothers me too, because I've always been saying that I like doing these things to her. What I was being told just did not make sense, I almost felt like I was going crazy. I asked her if she wants to wait until marriage, even though I felt rejected and etc. And she said she still wants to wait and that a lot of women wait, and a lot of women do what she's doing (Honestly, I don't know any of these women and I wish she would introduce me to them). I tell her I'm scared that marriage won't change any of this, and she says it can, and there's no reason why it can't. I'm honest and tell her I'm not sure how.  She then says she is making this choice and she can't compare her choice to my feelings of rejection because she can only try to understand what I'm feeling. I don't know how I felt about hearing this. 

At this point I was getting frustrated to the point of being upset, 
I just asked her why wasn't she saying any of these things to me
before, and why would she make all of these assumptions out of nowhere. And she said she was sorry and she just assumed and stuck to it. I felt really upset at this point and I asked her why wouldn't she want to say anything to me about this stuff, and she said that she was just raised to always keep sex this way. Her parents never said peep about sex, and all she was told was from catholic school, ""only speak about sex when you're married"". I told her I was really bothered that she never even told me that either. She's told me about her choice to be a virgin in the past, but not something like that. I told her that I want her to talk to me about these things and I couldn't understand why in five years she never brought anything up. I told her this is really hard for me, and that it's harder that I can't talk to people and have to reach out to the anonymous internet. She then got upset and said that she feels like she's always messing things up and that it's because she just doesn't open up, and she never knows how to, and that she wishes she could understand how to talk better. Leading to she feels like she is incapable of being in a relationship because she always thinks things are going amazing and then out of nowhere things go bad and it always ends up being about her communication. At this point I just felt like shit. I didn't say it but I just felt like I was being selfish, and I still don't know if I'm just being selfish. It was getting late and she said she was tired.

Today, she called, didn't bring up anything, just asked ""are you going to break up with me"" jokingly, and I said ""no"" but she didn't go further into anything to do with last night. Called her back later this evening, asked her a few times if she was okay, and if she wanted to talk, no and no. I texted her and again asked if she wanted to talk about last night, and she said ""not today"". And so I asked if that meant that she wanted to talk about it later, and she said ""I think"". And I got more upset, and asked was there any reason why we shouldn't talk about it, and she said no, and that ""she told me how the felt and that's it"", she just didn't want to talk today. Would this upset you? I'm questioning everything about myself now. I don't know if I'm being crazy, selfish, unjustifiably upset, I don't know what the fuck is going on with me now. She asked me if I was upset, I quickly responded yes and that it was because I just thought she would want to at least let me know she wanted to talk but not yet, instead of having to ask. She started again with saying she just keeps upsetting me. I'm to tired, I told her I'm going to bed. 

Overall there's a voice in the back of my head telling me that we have extremely different definitions of sex. Mine is expression and physical validation, her's is .. I'm not even sure, marital duty? I don't see how waiting for marriage will benefit our relationship (and I did say that last night as well). The whole time I kept asking her if I'm just doing something wrong, and she can be completely honest. And she just said she has communication problems and she still wants to stick by her choice. I feel like I shouldn't have gotten upset at her trying to push me inside her, and I wish I could've just been appreciative that she just thought it would give me pleasure, maybe I'm just being selfish, I don't know. She knows I have a high libido, she knows that last year I went on medication that increased my libido. I'm tired of masturbating to porn. I'm tired that people say I should get a hooker or go to a strip club. I'm tired that I can't even talk to my guy friends about this kind of stuff. These are battles I don't need. I'm so tired.

I feel ugly because I feel like if I was more appealing as a partner, 
she'd be willing to take a risk on me after these five long years. 
If she doesn't want me, who in their right mind would want me?

Anyhow, I have no one else to talk to about this, so I might as well update you guys. I don't know what to do. I wonder if she'll actually say something tomorrow. 

**TL;DR**: Talked to her about everything, GF apparently had huge assumptions she never bothered to talk about, said she has severe communication problems and hates that she keeps fucking things up, wants to wait another 2-3 years until sex, wants to talk more but when she's ready, I am depressed.

Long &amp; Numerous conversations with wife suggest some failings on my part.,25,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1h08sy/better_showing_so_that_i_find_her_sexy_long/,"My wife and I have slowly been entering a worse and worse dead bedroom state. I'm sure there are some who have it worse than us, but it is psychologically wrecking to our relationship. Things were up and down, but acceptable for many years. Then, as the story often goes, we had a daughter (now 3 1/2). It was not a great birth experience (extremely long labor, C-section, and complications), and my wife was physically not able to have sex for a couple months afterwards, and I harbor no ill feelings about this time, for obvious reasons. 

She went back to work (medical school), which meant long hours and therefore extra stress. That combined with the baby made things very stressful and difficult for a while longer, which I understand.

We slowly resumed and things got briefly great again, but then they've slid off and now we have sex about once a month. When we have sex, it's actually good for both of us, which I think is a good sign. She's disappointed by the frequency too, although she is the one currently with the LL and I'm the HL spouse, and I'm the one who has to initiate.

Our last time, after an alcohol-fueled mini sex marathon (which I realize might lead some to claim I barely belong here, but it *was* after a month of no sex, and required alcohol to help), led to a lot of frank discussion (including temptations that we've *both* had). In short, she says that I don't make her feel sexy in general (and that I never have really done this) and that this has led to her gradually not feeling like having sexy times or initiating them.

And, I have to admit, I've never been great at showing emotions -- showing that I love her or find her sexy, particularly in public or in front of other people/family. I'm good at things like: taking care of the house, raising our daughter, making an income, and doing chores. But internet jokes and magazine advice aside, I have to admit that cleaning the house and showing appreciation isn't really a libido booster (just, perhaps, a part of a healthy relationship).

She gives such things as ""good"" examples (that I don't always do): kiss her passionately when she gets home, get lost in a sexual moment, squeezing her ass, texting her my thoughts about her, etc. But I find it hard to do these on a consistent, daily basis.

1371578600.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,1gljye,[32/M] Marriage to a [32/F] and Forced Celibacy,24,8,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gljye/32m_marriage_to_a_32f_and_forced_celibacy/,"Greetings!

I'm a 32/M married to a 32/F. We've been married for about 5 years and we dated for about a year prior. She and I met on online.

My wife is pretty dang cool. She's funny, smart as hell, has a good job, and is my best friend. I love her, truly. We're expecting our first child soon, too.

I imagine at this point you're sensing a ""but"" coming up, and you're right. The problem for me, and I feel terribly shallow about this, is sex. Actually, it's the lack of it.

After we got married and before she got pregnant, we had sex maybe 2 times per month. Now, I realize there are differences between libidos. I don't expect to get it every single day three times a day (as I might like) but a max of 24 times a year is outside my comfort zone.

If we do have sex, she comes up to me and says, ""Do you want to go to the bedroom and have sex?"" I can tell it's a chore for her, and I feel bad about it. It's all about getting it done ASAP. I feel like the girl in the relationship when I'm trying to get her to cuddle for a while first.

She says she enjoys it (and she seems to) but has also said it's just not something she wants to do. I've asked for BJs (emphatic NO). I've asked for HJs (""Ugh, it takes just as long."") Luckily I have high speed Internet access.

I tried all kinds of things to ramp up our sex lives:

*     cleaning and doing housework
*     buying her gifts (I do enjoy that)
*     being romantic
*     talking about it
*     not bothering her about it (at this point I haven't ""put the moves"" on my wife in several years because I'd be shut down 100% of the time)
*     reading self-help books on the subject
*     telling her I love her more
*     telling her I love her less
*     asking about toys/fetishes/fantasies
*     humor
*     telling her she's beautiful (every day, she is)

The list goes on. I understand that women go through changes when they get pregnant, but things have gotten progressively worse since then. Unfortunately I find pregnant women incredibly sexy. We've had sex twice since the New Year's Eve Sex that got her pregnant. (She got pregnant, I got carpal tunnel.) It's also tough that (a) I knew this lack of sex would happen when she got pregnant because she got what she wanted out of it, (b) I was on the fence about having a kid. I'm glad we are, but part of me regrets it. I honestly didn't think we had sex often enough for her to get pregnant, but it does only take one time. Plus, I had the ultimatum of baby or else (or else she'd leave). I was at least looking forward to a long period of trying to get her pregnant... No such luck.

It's starting to affect me more than I thought possible. It's all I can think about and it stresses me out beyond belief. I'm turning into a huge grump and I don't like it. It's making me short with her and my friends. It's making me more than a little crazy, too. I've even thought about asking her for an open relationship, but I can't see that going any way but bad.

I don't want to cheat on her. Honestly, though, I'm afraid that one day I'm just going to hit a breaking point and do it. Part of me thinks that she wants me to do it while she remains blissfully ignorant so it's no longer her responsibility. I went so far as to make an appointment with a call girl once, but I cancelled it. Part of me feels like, if you're going to close the store for good, don't be surprised when people start to shop elsewhere. I realize that's probably the wrong attitude.

I'm not a perfect man by any stretch of the imagination, but I try really hard to be a good husband. I'm just really... depressed about this whole situation.

I've even done some research into drugs that suppress the male libido. I mean, that's crazy talk but at this point I'd pretty much do anything to help this situation.

So, what do you guys think? What can I do? I don't want to get a divorce, that's just shitty. Any help is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My wife never wants to have sex with me.

Its my anniversary today, and I have never felt so ugly, pathetic and worthless. 

My body is aching to be held. 


I have been with my partner (24M) (Me- 25F) for 18months. Hes a lot more inexperienced in bed than I am, but thats never bothered me, he's always been keen to learn. 

The past 6 months have been growing more excruciating for me. I have been constantly rejected made to feel like I ""make everything about sex"". 

I know I am not paticularly beautiful. I don't have a nice body. But I do my best to work with what I've got and while all other aspects of my relationship are usually fantastic, the constant rejection has finally broken me. 

I know there is alot of people here who have been dealing with DB for alot longer than me, and I honestly dont know how they have managed. I feel completely defeated. I guess i just needed to talk to other people in my situation. 

I'm going to go home tonight, pretend not to notice that he hasn't made any effort for our anniversary, keep face for as long as I can then go to bed. 

The past 3 months I have cried myself to sleep so many times. He doesn't notice. 

I am completely miserable but don't have the strength to leave. We live together, and I am not financially secure enough to move out just yet. He tells me he loves me every single day and I want to call him a liar every time.  

I watch his hands and long for them to be on me. I watch his lips and I'm desperate for him to kiss me like he did before. I want so badly to be wanted and desired.

A few months into being together he asked me if we could watch porn while we had sex, I was quite into porn then so of course I agreed. Soon after I realized he had a serious addiction. To the point when it felt as though he was using me as a masturbatory aid. The passion quickly disintegrated &amp; the peace followed soon after. He has said things to me that my self esteem will probably never recover from when I tried to curb his addiction in the beginning. 

We pretty much stopped seeing each other due to this. He begged me back promising to quit (we had tried compromise such as not every time in the past but it always ended up back there). So we get back together.

Now moths later I find out he's been lying about watching it (which I knew cause apart from thr fact our sex life was suffering it was pretty obvious).

We have sex now but its rare and almost always with s sleezy movie if not porn on or with him disappearing to the toilet before hand... with his phone.

I feel like cause he tried to quit that I'm being unreasonable but I'm still so hurt &amp; upset by this. He has shamed me about masturbation in the past &amp; shows no interest in my masturbation, has trouble coming with me, but will come easily from watching some chick masturbate on a screen.
 
This shit hurts &amp; I'm sick of it. He says hes trying but it doesn't feel like it &amp; defo doesn't feel like enough.

Am I being unreasonable &amp; asking too much by wanting the intimate passionate sex we had in the beginning? He says that's not possible cause its the honeymoon period, I say it is if you want it to be &amp; make the effort.

I finally worked up the courage to post about the situation between my wife (52f) and me (32m[*not a typo, 20yr age difference*]) a few days ago on a post over in /r/chronicpain, got chastened for ""making it all about me"" and decided to go ahead and post here, after months of lurking, because I think you'll understand better what I'm going through (or at least have a better grasp on whether I'm just being an inconsiderate jerk). 

As I look at the calendar and see our 13th anniversary approaching this weekend, I'm forced to wonder whether we'll reach #14. Every time I consider a divorce, it gets less and less scary and feels more and more possible. We've had more than a few discussions about this, but I'm starting to think a full Talk with an ultimatum or trial separation is the next step. 

Incoming wall o' text, with slight modification from my original for clarity. Didn't link because I deleted the original:

My wife has degenerative disk disease in three disks in her lower back, along with arthritis in her SI joints and hips and a few other issues. 

The injury that precipitated all this occurred years before we even met. It was mild, and would only occasionally flare up to the point where she'd need meds. In the first couple years of our relationship, the sex was brilliant - daily+, intense, creative, adventurous, physically and emotionally satisfying for us both. 

She had a second injury about a year after our daughter was born. We had no health insurance at the time of the injury, and didn't realize how serious it was, so it didn't get treated for a few years - ""just a sore back"" wasn't enough to get her to go to the doctor when we had to choose between a doc visit and food for our child. 

Eventually, it progressed to the point of debilitating pain, so we finally got to the doctor. She was at first simply given non-narcotic painkillers, but after those failed to even touch the pain an x-ray and MRI showed the extent of the damage. She graduated to opiate painkillers, and has since been on a slow upward climb as her opiate tolerance builds. 

Every new scan shows worsening of her condition. She refuses to try a surgical repair because of an anesthesia scare during a hernia operation a few months after our daughter was born. Every few months, her dosage either rises or changes to a new combo of meds. And through all this, between the pain and the opiates, her libido has been destroyed - although as I think on it, it had started suffering before the opiates, during a time when we didn't have a place of our own and had to couch surf with a friend. We went most of a year celibate then, due to no real opportunity or privacy being available to us. 

On rare occasions, she'll show surges of the sexual animal she used to be. This past January was amazing; we had more sex in January than we had all of last year (I know; I've been keeping track). Then, as quickly as it improved, it died off again. We've had sex twice since February 1st. 

So that's my situation. Here's the killer: I'm faced with an effectively sexless marriage for the rest of my life. I have no good options. My wife is the love of my life - I don't want just sex, I want sex with her. I want to feel like the woman I love finds me attractive and wants me. I can stay here and suffer through, tormented every time I look at her, every time she has a flash of libido at an inopportune time (and I know that by the time we can act on it she will have lost the urge), every time I try to initiate and get rejected. Or I can leave, breaking up an otherwise happy family, possibly losing my daughter, being seen as ""the bad guy"" for bailing on my disabled wife because of what many will see as a selfish reason, and knowing that my leaving would cause the woman I love to suffer just so I can get laid.

A little back story...  We've been married for 8 years with 2 great kids.  2 years ago, I brought up our DB situation to my wife, which at the time had LL.  The outcome was that she just wasn't attracted to me anymore. I had gained quite a few pounds over the years and it played a big part in the equation. Obviously, my first course of action was to loose the weight, and I did (80lbs) over the course of a year. 

All this time, I never pushed for sex. I thought, hopefully the tides will turn and she will show a little bit more affection when she's ready. Unfortunately, it never happened. I have to say that we still had a great time together outside of the bedroom...

Well, 6 months ago, the unexpected happens; she breaks down and asks me why I never initiate sex anymore. She feels totally neglected. Ouch. I told her I would definitely make an effort and things would be better from now on. Great.

This is where it gets complicated. I haven't been able, to this day, to look past her telling me she wasn't attracted to me a few years ago. Every time I think of initiating sex (pretty much every night), it gets awkward, anxiety sets in, and I refrain from doing so. This awkwardness snowballed up to this weekend, when she brought it up again. 

Anyhow, tonight we had a long talk and she mention that she wants to talk to a councillor about our situation (by herself) in order to figure out if she can get past our issues (apparently, there are quite a bit, but she refused to tell me what they were). Divorce is definitely one of her option (not that it matters, but she is a divorce lawyer).  One thing is for sure, sex is off the table for now, and I was told that there's nothing I could do to make things better at this point.

I mentioned my reasons why things went down like they did over the past few years, but she couldn't believe I've been holding hold to this for so long. Totally dismissing it...

Sorry about all this rambling, I guess I just feel a little helpless.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your insight. After much soul searching these past few days, I've concluded that the root of our issues is caused by my ""nice guy"" disposition. Up to now, I've put my needs aside and did everything I could to make sure SHE was happy.  She, being the dominant person in this relationship, is unknowingly(?) using me as a doormat and it decreases her attraction towards me. I know she is not enjoying being bitchy all the time, but I've just let it happen over and over again. 

This is a new chapter in my life. Hopefully it's not too late to fix our marriage, but if it is, this epiphany will surely help me going forward.

She raised my children, sacrificed her career for her family and has been cherished and loved the entire time.

LL has no interests other than a bit of gardening.  Literally no hobbies.  Few friends or other people in her life besides me.  We have all the money a person could want, amazing kids and from the outside a great life.  We also have a DB.

I have read the threads about rape victims 'freezing' - this feels very familiar, and I have asked my wife about it several times over the years.  She doesn't come out and deny it explicitly, but she is dismissive.  I do believe she lost her virginity in a less-than-ideal manner, probably to a jerk of a guy (didn't know her then).  She was married before me for 10 years and had a DB with that man as well.

Now that menopause has taken hold, the 8-10 week intervals we ""enjoyed"" for many years have lengthened to many, many months between having sex.  It has been nearly a year at this point.

LL is too anxious and ticklish to be touched in any way.   She abhors kissing, in 20 years we have had sex with the lights on maybe 3 times, and oral sex is just not going to happen - all of this is way too personal for her to handle.

I feel like I have to make the choice between losing everything familiar in my life (e.g. my marriage and the woman I love), and sex.

I feel like I have to make this decision every day.  Over and over again.

She describes herself as completely numb - literally no feeling in her genitals beyond what you might feel in your elbow.  She says she feels better when we talk - but ultimately it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

I have gone through years of internalizing it - if only I could just do the right thing, approach the right way, wash enough dishes, make enough money, etc. then she'd understand that I am 'real' and safe and here forever.

We didn't have sex until about two weeks after our first date - I told her the next time I saw her that she was my first and she told me that she had no idea. Since Valentine's day, however, we haven't had sex and I fear it is because she is no longer sexually attracted to me. I've outright suggested having sex, I've tried to initiate it with foreplay, I've even not touched the issue for three consecutive times we've hung out, as suggested by a seduction article as a tip to get your girl to initiate.

Let me just say this, the world wouldn't end if I lost this girl, but I would really miss her company.

-She is fairly sexually conservative- she refuses to give blowjobs and we've only had sex missionary style with me on top.
-After having sex the first time, we had sex about 1-2 times a week until Valentine's day. Since then we have not had sex.
-When I hung out with her a couple times ago (this was after a couple times of not asking her to have sex/initiating in any way), we were cuddling in my bed and she was throwing her legs into my lap. I think she was trying to initiate sex and I knew that, but for some reason I was being dumb and sticking to the ""must not give in"" mindset that I probably misinterpreted that seduction article's advice to be.

I don't know what I've done wrong, I know I'm not a sexual god but I'm also relatively fit and as giving as I can be during sex (I don't go downtown but I don't really feel obligated to considering she won't blow me). Maybe it's a foreplay issue? I just don't know why she would have sex with me at first and then is all of a sudden not interested, but will still cuddle with me (which we do 95% of the time we hang out). She doesn't really ""make out"" with me anymore (unless she's drunk), but she kisses me when I pick her up and drop her off at her house and when we're lying in bed occasionally. I really don't know what to do, I can count the amount of times I've had sex with this girl let alone in my life on two hands, I know I'm not experienced and I've done everything I can as far as searching the net for tips and advice on how to be sexual/a good lover. I really like this girl and I don't want my inexperience to ruin my only relationship.

M(30),25,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1azcuf/my_wife_f24_ll_keeps_waiting_for_the_perfect/,"Married 5 years, I'm 30 and my wife is 24, with two kids and the last born in November. It's been 7 months since our last intimacy on any level (beyond hugs/kisses) and it tears me up. We had large dry spells in the past and, even at best, we've been 2-3x per week (average typically 1-2x per month). I've always tried to give her space and not pressure her into intimacy but it just doesn't work. 


I've tried a lot of tips and tricks from this group, including a massive cleaning spree and letting her take it easy. That just back fired since I now do 90% of the house hold chores (+ picking up after the kids). I've also had a talk with her about reciprocation, what my goal would be, and how we can improve our situation. These talks usually just end with her 'needing to be more comfortable with herself and me' and promises of progress... then larger dry spells.


I guess the last straw was a few weeks ago. We had childcare and the house all to ourselves for the night... but when I tried to initiate she mentioned how she didn't feel 100%, that she really wanted to get back into intimacy with me but wanted it to be just right. I haven't tried to initiate since, but she's mentioned to me a few times how she'd like to have intimacy again but has a bunch of excuses as to why it's not the right timing. I've mentioned counseling for her (or joint), but she dodges that question.


I just have a big fear that, at best, we'll get back to vanilla intimacy 1x / month... while it's just torture for me.


I'm just not sure what my next step should be. I don't believe in divorce or cheating and love my kids to death.

I posted before about my LL husband, and how it was complicated by us living in a foreign country, having children, his mother being controlling, etc.

Today I was reading around in here &amp; found the post with the wall-o-links and read through some of those, and I realized that this is all **so much more than a DB**.

I'm really, really angry on a deep level and that isn't going to just go away. Just getting regular sex isn't going to fix it. I have let myself fall into a state of disrepair physically &amp; emotionally because I'm so fkg sad.

I've been on antidepressants for a long time, and whenever I would try to go off of them I would get overwhelmed by all of this &amp; think it was a symptom of depression returning and put my dose back up. But now I'm going off of them super slowly, I'm not depressed overall - but this coupled with better nutrition (not stuffing my feelings with food) has led to me not being able to hide from it all anymore.

My marriage is a mess.

The reason I haven't been able to face leaving him is because I have allowed myself to be such a mess in the meantime. I can't even think about whether this marriage is salvageable or not until I fix myself. I have actually been terrified that if I was desirable to other men I would stray, out of desperation. Now I see that I wouldn't, out of self respect - but I might leave.

Things I Want from Life &amp; from Marriage:

1) I want to be attractive again. I want to look in the mirror and know that if he isn't going to want me, someone will, and that I have other options besides being alone or attracting someone with no self-esteem. Even if I am alone I want to like what I see.

2) I want to be valued. I have never been valued in this marriage. From day one he has treated me with complete disrespect, and he has allowed his family to abuse me to the point that I refuse to be around any of them any more.

3) I want to be able to make simple choices without it becoming a life-or-death issue. I should be able to go out with friends without getting passive-aggressive sighs &amp; comments and abuse. I should be able to decide I want a dog (he has his big dog that he has completely relinquished all care of!). I should have equal access to our money without being berated for it.

4) I want self-respect again. I've given it all away.

Simply put? I've let him mash me down into a part of a person that I don't even like. I'm scared, because I don't think any self-respecting person would stay put in this situation, and I know where that leads. I'm scared that if I do go, I will never be able to choose a relationship for myself where I get what I want.

But this way of life has been coming to an end for me for a long time now. It started with me FINALLY putting my foot down about his family's crazy, but now so many things are becoming untenable for me.

In the meantime I am also looking at financial resources for myself, so that in 6 months to a year I can be where I need to be for financial independence. That is certainly plenty of time to know whether this marriage is going to improve with me or not.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_19ketn,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19ketn/a_sad_girls_manifesto/,

She said that she wants to be a ""nympho"" for her husband because it's not fair to me and that she would like to have sex all the time, just the desire isn't there.

I think I finally get the whole ""low libido"" thing and she gets my high sex drive as well. I told her that the creams and pill probably don't work and it's more than likely a mental thing she needs to overcome. I asked her how many times per day she thinks about sex. She said sometimes she doesn't think about it at all, but when she does, it's probably once a day. I told her to try to start thinking about it more often and I would help her to do that by sending her naughty texts and emails throughout the day. I also, told her that if we started having sex more, then maybe she will want to have it more. Also, she realized that the reason we had sex so much when we first started dating was because it was new and exciting, so I told her that we needed to come up with new and exciting things to try. She seemed very interested in all of this and even mentioned that we need to go to an adult store(sex shop) this weekend.

No sex last night for Valentine's Day, but this morning, after I fed my 6 month old, my wife told me to get my ass in the bedroom. We had a good time and she wants it again tonight.

Been with my wife for 18 years, married for 10. Normal / regular intimacy for the first couple years (when we were in college), then last couple years of college she started losing interest (body issues; she looks great to me). 

When we had kids, as expected, things got way worse. Averaged 6-12 times / year.

Now, we haven't done anything physical at all since last July. 

We're in counseling for a host of reasons, one of the biggest being us disagreeing on childrearing techniques (we have three little ones). I think she's overbearing to the kids, so anything I do looks lax / reckless to her, and this is her biggest turnoff.

Happy to write that all down. Never talked to anyone else about this besides our therapist, so I appreciate having like minded people to share with.

Am I selfish to expect progress?,27,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/17xl83/my_long_term_girlfriend_is_becoming_increasingly/,"I'm 26/m and I've been in a relationship with a 26/f for 10 years now. When we started out she was very sexual, more so than I was, but over the years it petered out. We've lived long distance from each other a couple of times, and I guess being out of intimacy might have killed it. It went from being every time we saw each other to maybe a couple of times a week, then maybe once a week (to be expected). Now, over the last 2-3 years it has been getting worse and worse. Right now I'm approaching 2 months. It was at least six weeks before that, and last time anything happened she was quite drunk.  

I say anything, because I'm including anything. She says she clamps up and penetration hurts, she says I'm too big (I suppose I should see that as a positive in all of this but I don't). I've tried to be understanding, I've given her time, space, I've been gentle and never gotten annoyed with her at failed attempts (I mean this - I haven't just hidden it, I haven't been angry at all). I've told her to try whatever she can - although I've told her I'd prefer something better than a handjob because I can do that myself. It's becoming less and less frequent, as though she's not trying. We've tried lube, we've tried rules to make it easier (eg. both agreeing we won't try penetration even if we both want it). I've even suggested mutual masturbation would be enough to get comfortable with each other again. The only time I get angry is if she's trying something and obviously looks annoyed.  

She says she doesn't like sex, has no drive for it, doesn't want it, and she can't help it. She says everything leading up to it is the same; without arousal she doesn't want it. I asked her to try building up to the point where she remembers how much she used to enjoy it. I make sure she has an orgasm every time (even if she has to help out).  

We've only ever been with each other, and I've never cheated. If this was anyone else I'd suspect she was, but I know she isn't; I can't explain why I just know she would never do that, and I believe her reasons.  

I am getting so annoyed with the situation, so frustrated. More and more I'm thinking I'm in the wrong here, and that instead of expecting her to be something she isn't, instead of being selfish, I should either accept it or leave. I love this girl completely, but I feel like I'm stuck and consigning myself to a life of frustration if I stay. She says she wants to marry me and have children (I've tried explaining how that wouldn't work) and I want the same except for this one thing. I just can't keep doing it. I've spoken to her about it a load of times. Sometimes I sleep in another room because I'm so frustrated lying next to her. I told her that seeing her undress really annoys me now because I want it but can't have it.  

It's so frustrating. I feel like I'd be leaving her over something trivial, yet something so important. I've told her she's left me in a position where I'm sexually frustrated and can't have sex with anyone in the world. I've told her it's ridiculous that she holds exclusive rights to something she doesn't want, that I don't want to be with someone else but she needs to realise the situation she's putting me in. My options are not have sex, cheat, or leave her, and I'll never cheat.

Even though it wasn't my intention and we engage in witty banter all the time, she took that pretty hard but I was too obtuse to notice at the time.

Later she was saying that she wants to get her hair done and I said I couldn't even see her greys, which she's had since she was 20.  This one I feel bad about.  In retrospect, it's easy to be sensitive to someone's feelings, but being mindful all the time is something I still need a lot of work on.  Apparently she was talking about getting highlights.

For the rest of the night she looked upset but would say it's nothing when I would ask.  I figured it was just menstrual cramps like usual so I got her a hot chocolate and an advil.  It wasn't until bed time when she tells the cat she'll love him even when he's past his prime with grey hairs.  That's when it hit me.

No wonder she doesn't want to fuck me.  I'm an asshole.  I'm an honest asshole, and a caring asshole but I probably make her feel like shit all the time and I'm too thick to realize it.  I know it doesn't help that she's hormonal right now, and she'll be the first to say that, but regardless it still must have been awful for her to hear those things from the person whose job it is to keep her safe and happy.  Time to take finding a counsellor off the back burner again, I guess.

I don't know if going full damage control was the right thing to do or not, but I couldn't help it.  I explained why I thought she was upset and she confirmed that I was exactly correct.  I apologised for hurting her feelings, said that I didn't intend to do it and that I'm really trying to get better about thinking before I open my big mouth.  I told her I love her as much as ever, that she will always be beautiful and that I'll always be happy with her.

I've been lurking here for awhile and have read loads of story people whose bedrooms are dead for a load of different reasons, a lot being people loosing interest in their partners. I'm here to tell you my story of how random things in life has totally killed my bedroom life.
I met my wife in 2005 we became friends very fast and connected very well. We was friends for a year until I stuck myself out and we started dating, was great we both knew we wanted to be with each other dated for 7 months and i asked her to marry me on 7/21/2006 and we set our date a year later. All was well married, moved into our first house, sex was great 3/4 times a week.

So what went wrong? Well in 2008 my wife was on her way to work and way trying to open our garage door and it was frozen shut. She pulled hard and threw her back out. In a ton of pain she came back in called me at work and told me what happened, I told her to phone her mom, who lived only a couple minutes away and have her take her to a ER. She had fucked up her lower back bad, they gave her some meds and told her to go to her family doctor. We did. X-Rays MRI she damaged 3 discs, and calcium had formed in them. We was told her would have to work her back and help build it back to where it was. We tried and tried. Sexual intercourse now hurt her in ways she couldn't handle, which I could totally see the change in her and how it made her. 

2 years after that winter 2010 our bedroom is almost dead it's hard to have a sex life when no matter what position it's done in. We pleased each other in other ways which I was totally fine with. That winter was hard my wife couldn't get off the chair she couldn't move felt like her arms and legs Back to doctors, nothing take these pain meds and don't worry about it.

Over the last two years she's in pain 24/7 sleep is scarce and she up 5 to six times a night. I have moved out of the bedroom and got my own room so i could get a good night sleep. Which in it's self made sexual stuff down to almost never. The beginning of 2012 in January, was the last we did anything. The thing is, I have thought about leaving but i can't. I love her, she's my best friend, and it's not like she is choosing to not do anything she simply can't. We found out she has a couple different things which have all come together to make a shit storm. I love her so much I wish i could take the pain away, my bed is dead but not by choice of me/my wife or just growing apart. complex medical problems have made things stop. We don't snuggle/ touch/ kiss sleep in the same bed. It saddens me to see people on here some have kids and i can see why they want to keep things together, but those that are on here because they don't find there partner sexually stimulating or other things. I see them and think you can move on and find someone more compatible with you. I do not see any change for my dead-bed, I love my wife and hope someday she will be better. 


**Sorry for the long story here's quick version
Met wife, she got hurt, found out she has a lot of medical problems, haven't had sex in over a year that includes anything. Problems not her fault just randomness of life. I can't leave her it's not like she chose to be like this.**

It's something really important to him, and although not my highest priority in a relationship, until a few months ago, I enjoyed it as well.  Now though, I feel asexual.

I don't want to have sex, I never seek it, and I often feel overwhelmed by how much he wants it.  (This is not an unreasonable amount, and I had no problem with it before.)  It's not just him, I don't want to masturbate either- let alone have sex with someone else.

Recently he asked me if I still found him attractive which was something he had been making him really worried/sad/upset/feel ugly.  I explained the situation to him, but it made me really sad that I had been (unintentionally) hurting him so much.

We've decided to try new things out, see if I can get my sex drive back but I feel incredibly guilty.  I want to make him happy, and I know that having a healthy sexual relationship is integral to that, but I can't.

I've tried porn, even the stuff I used to like grosses me out- like makes me actually disgusted.  We've tried more foreplay, but although that makes the physical act of sex easier, it doesn't make my mind want it any more.  Even things that are ""just about me"" I don't want.  We've talked about it, and I know it's not ""my fault"" but I feel like a failure.

I am incredibly stressed and guilty about this.  I constantly feel like a bad girlfriend, like a failure, useless, worthless, etc.  It's effecting the rest of my life too- I've been so depressed recently I can't get out of bed in the mornings, I skip class, I don't even bother to go to lunch or pick up my phone because I don't have the energy and I can't stand having other people see me like this.

He doesn't want to break up because of this, but I can't imagine us being happy together if this lasts a lot longer.

I was debating whether or not I should surprise him when I get off work tonight by coming over in lingerie, thigh highs and heels, all wrapped up in a trench coat surprise. 
If he's not feeling it and opts to play mass effect instead, I'll be devastated. (Weve both been very busy and exhausted lately) But There's that chance of success. 

I guess I'm asking you all if LL respond well to that sort of situation. We haven't had any arguments about our sex life so there's no hostility, but it is known and we are both aware of it. I just really don't want to put myself out there to be stomped into a pit of depression if rejected...

Reading through the different problems that I am seeing, and, really feeling bad for those involved in these situations. I was reluctant to make a post, but, I just felt this is something that I needed to do.

Reason I have been reading through these posts, is, my ""S.O."" (I won't reveal gender as to ensure my identity won't be given away) is a big part of these threads. And, although it is a very bad (painful) position for everyone here to be in a relationship such as these, I want to remind everyone that it is JUST as painful (if not more) as well to be on the other side.

You can call me the reason for a DB. Yes. It's me. I rarely have sex with my ""S.O."" and he/she comes to this subreddit, and, will most likely be reading this.

I am assuming that most people understand the pain is on BOTH sides of this, but, for the people that don't, PLEASE, don't (for a minute) think that it isn't painful for the other half.

My average day is:

1 - Watching my ""S.O."" walk around and attempt to function from day to day, knowing how deeply in love I am with him/her, and, knowing how deep the pain goes for him/her due to the fact that there is something in our relationship that i can't provide. Something that is ALWAYS missing. It crushes me so deep down inside, that, I wish the roles were reversed.

2 - Every so often, I get reminded of why he/she is hurting. The knife is already there, but, this is as if it is being kicked in harder. I know I am not being reminded for any hateful or devious reasons, but, just to be reminded of it at all brings the pain to an all new level. It sometimes feels that i am being reminded of a problem that i have. For example , if I was in a wheelchair. To have your ""S.O."" remind you every couple of months that he/she is sad because you are wheelchair bound. 

3 - There ARE times I feel ""in the mood"" (if you will), but, because of how much the subject becomes the center (the CORE) of our relationship, I feel that if I do engage in any ""activity"", that he/she may think I am reacting to NOT being active. In other words, just trying to make him/her happy.

4 - Last, but, DEFINITELY not least, I just don't get the urge for sex very often. So, what am i to do? Engage in activities if I really am not in the mood? Many years ago we made that promise to each other that we will NOT fake this. I feel it would be a lie to have sex with him/her if the mood isn't there.

I also want to make it clear, that, i do not feel anyone in this subreddit is mocking anyones pain, or, saying that certain parties are right/wrong. 

This post is to make it clear that this pain is on BOTH sides of the relationship. not just one.

Perhaps there are people that will disagree with the points I made. That's fine. I just needed to get my feelings out there.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_z8foa,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/z8foa/a_message_from_the_other_side/,
1345929849.0,18,self.DeadBedrooms,ytn92,"Thinking of breaking up with boyfriend tonight, any advice?",24,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ytn92/thinking_of_breaking_up_with_boyfriend_tonight/,"Hey guys.

So I've never posted, but I've lurked this community a little bit. I'd like some advice. This is pretty long, so bear with me. The scenario: we've been together for nearly 5 years. We're both 30 and we've been living together for a few years. Our relationship started out amazing. We were completely on the same page in so many ways, and excited to have adventures together. However my dissatisfaction began to bubble up not long after the honeymoon period was over. He started basically living at my apartment, and soon after I complained to him that our time together was getting boring; that we weren't spending *quality* time together but merely cohabitating. He was very resistant to this and frankly quite miffed at my complaint. Over time I got used to the new norm. When we moved in together legit-style, cleanliness quickly became an issue. Cleaning is not something he deems necessary. He does do dishes and laundry, but everything else he needs to be asked to do. I do the lion's share of work, in my opinion. And I can't even clean up his things for him because he gets mad when he can't find something. 

But probably the hardest thing for me was that our sex-life was starting to slide. It didn't happen over night, but over time it went from maybe a couple times a week to once, to once every two weeks, to once a month. And now I consider myself blessed if I've gone through a cycle and had sex once. I would proposition him occasionally, and as I was rejected with more frequency it would sting more and more. 

I've of course talked to him about this, several times. I've tried to broach the subject in the most delicate way I can manage. Once I got some sympathy. Once I was told that maybe I should try seducing him. Once I was told matter of factly that we just had different libidos and to just learn to deal with it.

 None of these conversations helped, and as they became more frequent he began to resent them and me for bringing them up. I began to blame myself (with some coaxing from him). Maybe if I give him more space. Maybe if keep my frustrations to myself and just try to be happy. And my most recent scheme, I lost 10 lbs to try and regain some confidence (of which I had very little) and make myself more attractive. None of this seemed to help. 

Around 6 months ago I suddenly realized just how little affection he'd been showing for me. Very rarely would he hug me or kiss me. I'd be the one to initiate these things. He would only say he loved me if I said it first. He's also vehemently unromantic. I used to really enjoy romance with my previous boyfriends; I'd make cheesy hand-made cards, mixtapes, surprise them with elaborate chocolate fondue spreads. But seeing as my current boyfriend showed little appreciation for that stuff I stopped being romantic. One Valentine's Day we got in a small argument over something stupid, which really bummed me out so I told him I didn't want flowers or any of that stuff, but I simply wanted him to not be *mean* to me on Valentine's Day. Well this incensed him and he totally went off on me for reasons that I still can't understand and left me sobbing alone in our bedroom. On fucking Valentine's Day.

So now we have the present. I feel under-appreciated, disrespected and most certainly unloved. We've had a couple Relationship Talks recently. I feel like I've let my needs be known, and suggested how to start to work on things. But I felt quite a lot of resistance to working on the things that I felt he needed to. He seems to feel that the bulk of the blame lies on my shoulders; that I'm nasty to him and that I act needy which makes him withdraw further. I certainly concede that I'm not my self lately around him, but can you blame me? I'm frustrated, and locking up my frustration doesn't work. I also don't think that having very basic needs is ""needy"". I've given him plenty of space. But what I have right now isn't anything close to how I think a relationship should be.

I've stuck through it for quite some time feeling unsatisfied. I did this because in a so many ways we are very compatible. We've had a lot of fun and adventures together, and I've certainly grown as a person from being with him. But his lackluster regard for my needs is just getting worse by the day. 

tldr; very little sex, little affection, messy, doesn't give a shit. Is there any hope?

The relationship is very loving. Our bedtime routine for the last two years is him reading to me for about 1/2 an hour, and cuddling and talking for at least that long before shutting off the light. We kiss often, hug, and really, I shouldn't complain. But I am.

Today I threw away an empty BC packet. It's the second one. We've been two months without sex, and before that it's been 1-2x a month, if that. Every time, it's been a very cursory ""quickie"", either that he's initiated right before we have to go out, or after I've basically straight-up asked him to fuck me. It's all been missionary, too - though we used to try new positions and things all the time.

This last week I did a ""steak and BJ"" night, and another BJ, and a 2am handjob. I've paraded naked in front of him.

The part that's my fault... The last time I basically begged and got a 10 min quickie, while we were showering afterword, I said, exactly, ""Um... Can we be romantic sometimes too?"" - he felt really badly and apologized a lot, kind of to the point of carrying on *too much* and... that was the end of it.

Shortly after we first got together, I switched Birth controls, and the new one *really* killed my sex drive. I know what it felt like to have sex be a chore. But we got to a point, where the pills ran out (for the week off) and realized we hadn't had sex for the entire month (well, I realized, I'm sure he was hyperaware of it). Even if he only brought it up once a week, I felt pressured. But the empty BC packet was a wake-up call, I got myself to the dr and switched prescriptions, and everything was fine for a few years.

Now it seems like a role reversal. He's still very loving, we still cuddle, but no sex. I try to bring it up, but the conversation either becomes a(n unsatisfying) quickie - what feels so much like a pity fuck to me - or he gets really upset and I have to spend the next two hours telling him I *do* love him, and it's just a sex thing, not a loving-in-general thing.

Other stuff that may be relevant:
* This last year I finished my undergrad and will start my Masters in sept. My MSc program comes with funding, so I've gone from having virtually no income and being supported by him, to earning about 1.5x what he does yearly.

* He works from home, and this summer I've been doing most of my work at home too. Maybe he's just sick of me?

* I have pretty awful body issues. I feel fat, and horrible, and ugly, despite actually having lost weight and gotten in better shape in the last year. I know it's in my head, but it's hard not to say he's lying when he tells me I'm beautiful. Maybe I finally convinced him.

* We adopted a cat three months ago.

Even if we never had sex again, I don't think I would end the relationship. I really do love him, and I love everything about him except the lack of sex. I know that if he was in a car accident and lost his penis I'd still stay with him, so maybe I should imagine this is the same thing.

When I found out she got the advice to break up with me from the internet I was pretty upset. She promised everything would be great and that she was only hooking up with this guy as a part of her sexual health. It was really hard for me to agree to this, but eventually I did. She said it could only bring good between me and her and she cried a lot about it. 

Prior to this she said even being attracted to other people or putting yourself in situations where you are attracted to other people is cheating. I went ahead and followed these constraints close and she even went as far to say if I hooked up with a random girl that wasn't my friend then it wouldn't be the same so I wasn't allowed to do that.

Right after she had sex with this guy the whole tone changed. It was the first time I had seen her in a week and she wouldn't look at me or kiss me or touch me. I found out she had hooked up with this guy because she had hickies on her neck. Then later I went to face book to tell the guy off because I was really upset and she wouldn't take the time to talk to me about it. Then she yelled at me and told me that I was being a dramatic about this whole situation and went on to call me a fucking idiot for three days solid.

It makes me feel like I have wasted 3 years of my life to get treated like this. I have only been there to support her all this time and now I feel like I am being thrown away. Every once in a while she talks about our future and how it will all be great after she gets single time in and then other days I am not even allowed to hold her hand.

She said we are broken up now and that I can go out with other people, but she added that I should not do anything romantic like hold their hands because we are on a break.

I am currently looking for a job and it is difficult. I am in a new place and all the people I hang out are from reddit. I want to get a job soon so I can move out but I have a hard time getting employers to talk to me.

She often ditches me to go hangout with other people when we are at gatherings then she tells me about them. She tells me that I am way better than all of them, but if I am better than all of them why do they deserve all of her time?

She really wanted to marry me and I was shopping for rings and planning it out. Sex is important to me, but I could easily spend my life with her. I also get this sense that she associated me with this horrible guy that really ruined things at the beginning. I want to note that when we first got together for the first few weeks things were amazing. Then her ex threatened to kill himself and she hooked up with him. This is when she atarted telling me I needed to change and that we were not compatible.

Maybe you might have some helpful advice.

My male partner and I have been together for 7 years. We've discussed and known from the beginning that if we ever had an unwanted pregnancy, we would both absolutely be in favor of an abortion. When it actually happened 4 months ago it was only a question of where to make the appointment and figuring out exactly what procedure I wanted. He was completely supportive through it all.

We agreed that we were both a bit traumatized by it and that neither of us would be emotionally ready to have sex again for awhile. In the 3 1/2 months since the surgery we had one really passionate make out that I think was mutually wanted. I've told him that with the proper birth control I'm ready to have sex again but I'm perfectly happy refraining from sex but still doing other things. I've been really emotionally needy since the surgery so I do need a lot to feel loved and wanted, but that doesn't have to require our genitals. Yet, with time he's become less and less willing to even kiss me. He says he just needs me to be patient and that my being needy is the big turnoff. He says we'll be fine and get through it, though I know that a huge number of relationships end after an abortion and not having sex is the biggest indicator.

So, reddit, I'm turning to you. Do I just need to stop worrying and it'll happen when he's ready? Or is he actually just not attracted to me anymore? Or what? I'm driving myself a little nuts about it all.

tl;dr - 7 year long relationship. Mutually agreed to get an abortion. He's too traumatized to have sex with me or anything else sexual with me. Is it probably over?

I'm just spiraling into bitterness, resentment, and depression over my generalized sense that my partner could not care less about my opinions, emotions, and needs. Every time I bring something up, I end up feeling worse than I did before. I've been distant and bitter, and I'm having a hard time controlling it, because our dead bed and everything that I feel because of it is always on my mind. I know that I need to not be so bitter in order to have any progress, but every time that she refuses to view things from my emotional point of view, it just reinforces my feelings, and so I give myself some space. Besides, the only thing I know are four years of rejection (8 years or so together), so I have no normal connection to sexuality any more. 

This is a letter I wrote and read to her last night, that resulted in me being yelled at. I came home on my lunch break today and tried to again have her just see the importance of making me feel like she could acknowledge where I'm coming from, but again I was just yelled at and made to feel worse than before. 

&gt;My choices are between setting myself up for disappointment or resigning myself to disappointment. To me, sexuality and intimacy are what establishes and reestablishes the connection between us. After four years of undesired celibacy, it has effected me in many ways. I don't feel like you care about me. Sex to me is not a luxury, but a necessity. It brings me close to you and makes me feel like I have a real partner. It changes how I view the world and makes me feel like I can do anything, and we are unstoppable. 

&gt;Without sex in our relationship, I feel unloved. I feel badly hurt by the constant rejection. I feel trapped. I feel like I'm somehow being used. I feel alone. I don't have any idea what it is like to not be rejected. Most importantly, I feel that you simply don't care about me. How could you say that you love me and allow me to suffer for years? How is our relationship so unimportant to you that you allow the biggest roadblock in our relationship to continue, all the while we suffer? How can you be so unsympathetic to my feelings? What it says about how you think of me and us is what upsets me the most and makes me feel the most alone. 

&gt;With that as context, I come home every night and your family is here, as well as new junk. The place is a constant mess.You yell at me for the tiniest things. You yell at me if I complain about anything. You tell me I'm not attractive enough. You treat me like a leper. You take no interest in anything that I enjoy. Any topic that veers far from your views is immediately shut down. Combine this with the isolation that I feel, and it should not be terribly surprising that I may be a little bitter.  

&gt;I need sex out of a relationship. That's the reason to be in a relationship instead of just friends or roommates to begin with. When I want things to get better and you are indifferent, it exacerbates my sense that you don't care. It further isolates me. When you tell me to not care about it, get over it, like today, I feel like you are validating my sense that you don't give a fuck about how I feel. 

&gt;I would think that you would thank me for sticking with you through this extended period of abstinence. Show appreciation, whatever. You should be more understanding that when you ask me to jump through another hoop or give you more time that I have been there done that a thousand times now. 

&gt;You want me to shut up, and ignore how I feel. Easy for you because you are obviously not upset that we do not have sex together. You are just sick of hearing about it. For me, I always think about it. All of our interactions and how I think of you, are framed by the effects of our celibacy. It doesn't go away, because again, back to the beginning, my choices are between setting myself up for disappointment or resigning myself to disappointment. 

&gt;At the very minimum, it is long past time to acknowledge my feelings.

She also does not like when I use various opiates, which I haven't been, but at least when I'm doped up, I am productive, happy, and care a whole lot less that I'm celibate. I never have had a physical addiction to dope, and in general think that it has served as a very effective anti-depressant. But whatever, I can't blame her for wanting me to not fall off the deep end with that. However, with that coping mechanism removed from my bag of tricks, I really don't have much to assuage my bitter moods. My counselor a few months ago basically said that I'm better off using, but that is neither here nor there. 

My mental health can't maintain this situation. I just feel broken down. I'm torn between making a real effort to just swallow my pride yet again and sublimate my feelings, and my sense that she needs to start by acknowledging my feelings at least before she can realistically expect my moods around her to improve. Part of me also feels that the way she makes me feel, that sex is the last thing that I would want from her, but I know from when we have had sex in some form or other on rare occasions over the last few years, that it changes everything for the better. It's like when the color comes on in the Wizard of Oz. At the same time, I also have a healthy fear of her, because just like I've grown accustomed to rejection, I've become accustomed to frightening acts of anger when she is crossed. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR So much bitterness, so much resentment. Nothing that she says or does makes me feel any better about the situation. What to do? Not married, but live together.

We're splitting up. ,19,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/v2p73/were_really_doing_it_were_splitting_up/,"Throwaway, obviously. I don't want my RedditGifts matches seeing this shit on my profile for the rest of my life, thankyouverymuch.

After being married 7 years, together for 10, we're actually seperating this weekend. 

Backstory: For the last few years, we've been averaging sex about twice a year, despite my many attempts. The rest of our relationship was completely amazing. He is a wonderful person, we never fight. I made excuses for it for so long; I didn't want to admit there was a problem. *He's focused on work, his family is stressing him out, he's not attracted to me because I gained a few pounds* blah, blah blah. For 3 years I've been asking him to go to counseling, but he wouldn't go. About a year ago, I told him that I couldn't stay in a sexless marriage for the rest of my life. I started going to counseling and told him he was welcome to come with me (he didn't). About 6 months ago, I told him I was leaving him more and more in my heart every day and I needed to make a change. Now, this weekend, he is moving out. 

Things have obviously built up to this for a very long time. It's definitely what I want. It's the right thing. But on the eve of the move, I'm pretty scared of what will come. 

Will I be able to take care of this house all by myself? I'm looking forward to the independence, but will I completely fail at fixing broken things, mowing the lawn, shoveling the driveway? Will my inner goddess put her head in her hands and sigh or will I rock it? Will I ever find a relationship with someone who treats me as good as he did AND will have sex with me? And like,  fucking *r/sex sex*, with toys and video and lots and lots of orgasms. Does that exist? Or am I a complete fool for throwing away a life with a wonderful man over a dead bedroom? Will I look back in ten years and think it was the stupidest thing I ever did? 

I feel so, so fucking guilty for making sex enough of a priority in my life to end a marriage for. 

Anyone feeling me? Did you leave? Was it the right thing? Do you want to leave? What is holding you back?

I’ve found solace in this community with so many people suffering from something I’ve never been able to talk to anyone other than my wife about (and only on a couple of occasions).This is going to be a bit off topic, but I am more comfortable posting here than at /r/relationship_advice.


This might be long.  To begin, bedroom has been dead since our last daughter was born four years ago.  I used to try and initiate sex but my wife continually had excuses.  It was a trying time for us when our youngest daughter was born, as our oldest daughter got sick (and made a full recovery thankfully) and was hospitalized for nearly a month soon after the birth.  I know this was hard on my wife as we had to visit a few hospitals  in larger centres for care.  (we live in Northern Ontario).  It was hard on me too, but I made sure to be the rock for our family.

My wife started gaining weight after that, and eventually went on anti-depressants.  She came off them a little bit later on my advice, when I recommended that she join a weight loss centre and a gym and do some things naturally to make herself feel better.  I’ve always been supportive of her.

After two years of very little sex, I found myself not even trying to initiate any more, and that seemed to be okay with my wife.  She always found a reason to not feel well, or to go to bed early, or to stay with the kids in their room when they woke in the middle of the night as ‘they needed her’.  I talked to her about that not being good for the kids or our marriage but it fell on deaf ears.

Then I just quit coming to bed, finding things to do late at night and porn.  We’ve maybe had sex 6 times in the last three years.  Our lives got busier, and we barley spoke to each other at all other than being with the kids.  We’ve always been very family oriented, we keep our kids busy and she really is a great mom.

Anyway, she has lost quite a bit of weight and I could tell she was feeling better about herself.  It was around that time last year she started going on weekend trips with her girlfriends to Michigan (we live on a border town).  I’ve always supported her in this knowing that she needed some time to herself too as she has been supportive of my activities.  

In the last month, they’ve been to Michigan twice.  This weekend is a holiday weekend coming up and I was looking forward to finally spending some time with my wife as we had nothing planned for a change.  On Monday she tells me they are planning another trip to Michigan to celebrate on of her friend’s birthdays.  All of a sudden my Spider Sense starts to tingle.

Her suitcase hasn’t even been unpacked yet since her first trip in April and my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through it yesterday.  I was surprised to find lingerie, frilly panties and very sexy tops; things she never wears for me.  Then I went through her drawers, I knew it was wrong but this didn’t sit well with me.
 
In her top drawer at the bottom I found some American cash she had stashed away.  This  was surprising too has we have never hid money from each other as far as I knew.  I counted the money, nearly $700 and, a phone number on a piece of paper that wasn’t her handwriting.  It was a mid-Michigan area code and google tells me it’s a cell phone number.  I started to tremble, but I wrote the number down and put the piece of paper back in her drawer.

I Skyped the number so it would show up as ‘unknown number’, and of course a man picks up.  I tell him it’s a wrong number.

Now things start to fall into place, of the time she has spent texting on her phone in the last two weeks (something she rarely does), quickly putting it away when I walk into the room.  One time last week I came to bed, and she got up, went to the washroom for a bit and then went to sleep in the kids room with her phone.

So last night I tried to make excuses to see her phone at the kids baseball practice.  I knew she had it with her, but she quickly told me she forgot it had home.  Then I tell her when we get home I wanted to update the OS of our phones and she finally gives in.  Again, I shouldn’t have, but I went though her text history quickly when she wasn’t around and it was blank – nothing there.  This is a person that usually had 500 emails and texts saved on her phone because she doesn’t clear her inboxes.  I sent a text to the number just asking if he was there and didn’t get a response back.

When I came back upstairs.   She asked me if something was wrong.  I told her I was upset about her going away again to Michigan.  I wasn’t ready to tip my hand about what I knew yet.

I asked her if everything was okay with us.  Ironically, we had a long talk.  I never brought up what I knew about the lingerie or the phone number as I’m confused and want to keep the upper hand in this.  It was the best talk we had in a long time and she told me how much she misses me and that we don’t spend enough time together and that we need more us time.  She even asked me to go to bed to have sex.  I stupidly did and it was the best sex we’ve had in a long time.  I was angry and part of me was thinking that I’m going to gets some at least in case I’m kicking out the door next week.

 I think she beginning to suspects that I may be on to her. So, this morning, getting ready to go to work, I took that number our of her drawer again and wrote ‘I know about this and I love you’ on it. 

Really, I don’t know what to do next.  Lingerie, a phone number, hidden money and trips out of town don’t prove anything, but things certainly don’t look good for her.  I don’t know if she’s already cheated on me, or if she’s about to cheat on me and there’s still time to stop this.

My goal is to stay calm, and work this out logically, but my stomach is in butterflies.  I would never have thought this could happen to us, people tell me all the time what a great couple we are.  She always been a great mother, and this is totally out of character for her.

I don’t know if I just need to vent, or if I’m looking for advice, but thanks for listening.

TL;DR – my deadberoom problem has turned into a nightmare for me.

Here are the facts.

* We celebrated our 20^th anniversary last summer. She's 50, I'm 47.

* We both currently work at the same company in different divisions; our work sometimes overlaps, but not often.

* Although she's fit, my wife has several chronic diseases which require her to be on medications that kill any sex drive she might've had.

* Because of her diseases, we were unable to have children. We once talked about adoption, but didn't pursue it. The upshot is that we have cats instead of kids.

* Apart from a friendly hug here or there, we haven't had an intimate moment (sexual or even just one of those wonderfully charged touches) in over three years. I cannot remember when she last looked at me with raw desire. It's been many years--ten, at least, I would guess.

* A little over a year ago I decided to try to change my life by going back to weightlifting and commuting to work by bike. I've since lost nearly 60 pounds (I'm 6'5""; while I'm down to 285lbs, my goal is 265, which should be healthy given my frame.) My thought was to become more attractive to her in the process. As I've lost weight I've noticed women looking at and treating me differently. Lately I've even caught some friendly smiles from attractive women. There's been no similar response from my wife, although she tells me she's very proud of all the changes I've made.

* Over the past year, we've grown further and further apart. I still love her, in the sense that I love my sister: I want what's best for her, and I don't want to hurt her. I'm sure she loves me, too. Whatever spark I may have had for her feels finally and utterly extinguished.

* Also over the past year, I've felt increasingly anxious and trapped. I desperately want to have that connection with another human being which is rooted in deeply felt passion and desire for one another. I hunger, I guess, for the caress of another person who wants me as much as I want them and who wants to touch me, body and soul, as much as I want to touch them.

Okay, those are the facts as best as I can relate them. Here's the part of the story where I don't cover myself in glory. 

While out of town several weeks ago I visited a friend--a young woman (25yrs old) for whom I've long felt great fondness. I was her mentor for several years and we worked on a number of projects together. I drove to her house, cooked her dinner, and we sat and chatted over scotch. It wasn't too long before a touch led to a caress, a caress led to a kiss, and the kiss led to a night of the most fulfilling, deeply moving sex I've ever had in my life. Maybe it was because it had been so long for me, or maybe I've just never had a lover who was so compassionate and giving, while being so lost in passion herself. I abandoned myself to her completely, and she to me.

We've since chatted online, but I don't see any future together given how far away she is. To me, that night was magical and a kind of gift, showing me what was possible in life.

Sunday I told my wife I couldn't live like this anymore. It was the hardest conversation of my life. She wants to seek medical care for her sex-drive and marital therapy to help resurrect our marriage. She told me she thought we were doing fine these past years, although she could feel me withdrawing from her.

I welcome your thoughts, community. Is this just some midlife crisis, so I should stick it out come what may?  Alternatively, should I go and maybe end up alone--or maybe, just maybe, find that human touch I seem to need so desperately?

**TL;DR** Wife and I of 20 years have not been intimate in the last 3 years; I don't seem to have any feelings left for her, but she wants to try. Should I end it, or stick with it?

**Update:** I very much appreciate all your thoughtful contributions, and I want to comment on a few specifically in a minute. Reddit really is an extraordinary community. There is one misconception that I would like to clarify, if I may. It seems to the impression of many that I did not communicate my feelings or try. I did, many times. We've always been able to talk--we've at least had that much going for us. Sometimes we would attempt a kind of awkward, begrudging intimacy. Other times she would become angry at my attempts to tell her how lonely I was for her. Clearly, my attempts were inept. Yet I think in situations like this it's much easier for the one who doesn't want to be close (or, to put it in better terms, doesn't feel the need to be closely connected in those ways) to win the day, so to speak. Let me also say that I don't resent my wife or blame her. I think she's terrific. But I'm terrified on two fronts: Ending up alone myself in the search for some fantasy I'll never realize; Staying in a marriage that amounts to a kind of platonic priesthood.

I don't consider cheating because it is not even in the realm of things I desire. I have no interest in any other woman. But, at the same time, I recognize that nothing is going to change any time in the near future. How can you love somebody who perpetually makes you feel two feet small on a near daily basis? What part of the emotion that is love involves feeling like you are the least significant part of their life? When you feel like a placeholder? 

These are all actions and emotions that I would not allow anyone else in the world to get away with. But, after time, loving, and connection, or even kids in the case of others, the idea of what could again be love results in placing yourself in a situation that just prolongs your misery. There is a pot of gold just over the rainbow. 

I don't know about others, but for me, it is always 'if you do this, then, I can be intimate with you again', but I never seem to actual find the other side of the rainbow. 

With Stockholm Syndrome, you identify with your torturer, and begin to think that you deserve whatever treatment your torturer inflicts upon you. You deserved to be lashed, because you did not stand up straight when the torturer entered the room, as an example. It seems that this logic of I need to try this and then, we'll be happy, when combined with day to day misery is not that far off. I always have in the back of my head that Magnetic Fields song 'Grand Canyon', where he sings that 'you used to love me that way, so I know you can love me that way.' But, it doesn't seem quite that simple. I can be a bit hyperbolic in my rhetoric, but what do you all think of dead bedrooms resulting in a form of stockholm syndrome for the neglected partner?

23 y/o male here. My girlfriend andihave been together ~4 years. We were each other's firsts. Our last sexual encounter was the morning after valentines day last year when she had a quickie with me because she felt bad for rejecting me the night before. Nothing since. Had hopes for tonight, but not happening. 

We used to have a bit of a sex life; handjobs and fingering were frequent in the first year and a half. Sex a handful of times. Never oral -- she has zero interest giving or receiving. Before the last years pity-fuck, we had sex once in the pat 8 months. So for those of you keeping track, that's 1 sexual encountering 20 months. I take care of myself in that department now. She used to use sex like a dog trainer uses treats -- to reward me for something or to get something she wanted, and then withold it if I wasnt doing what she wanted me to,but that seems to have stopped; we just don't do anything sexual now. Oddly enough, because the sex was never a regular thing, I don't find myself going crazy, maybe because I can't miss what I've never had. That said, I am always horny and ready to go, she just never is.

She is almost always fine with kisses, hugs, etc., unless she's in a bad mood or watching tv or something (understandable), and every now and then she'll put my hand on her boobs, or touch my junk or something, but try as I might it is never followed by anything more. I've tried bringing it up, but she'll either say something along the lines of ""you're being pervy"", or laugh it off and say she just wants to cuddle.

I've to go all throwaway on this as my normal reddit account is well and truly known not just with my wife but friends and even family so apologies for the secrecy!  

On to the history.  We have been together for 13 years, married for 5 and have a 2 1/2 year old and 6 month old.  Our sexual relationship has always been a bit up and down, long before the kids came along, and has caused a few fights between us.

Sexual history is that I've been with a few partners and have had a threesome while my wife has only been with me.  I consider myself to have a high sexual want and am quite open minded in the bedroom and I genuinely consider trying anything once (I apply this idea outside of the bedroom too). 

When it comes to frequency, then I'd probably say once a month on average over the last 4-5 years.  Some times it's every weekend for a month and then nothing for weeks - longest time was 8 weeks before I finally mentioned it.  This was during one of those little experiment moments where I thought I'd let her initiate for a change..

I know this may sound a lot compared to some of the stories I've read in here but my main problem with having sex, is that it feels like something my wife has to get out of the way along with whatever other chores need to be done.

She is the most beautiful and sexually attractive person I know.  I always compliment how great she looks, always give the little sneaky kisses and bottom grabs when we're alone, always doing my best to be non sexually affectionate and I do a pretty good share of the house duties too.  I run my own company and have my work situation setup so that I'm at home at least 3 days a week (more on average), pick up kids from day care, cook, clean, etc.

We've had the talk so many times I have lost count.  We've covered every angle and it ends with both of us finding faults and agreeing to work harder on it, this will last a short time before it's all back to the way it has been.  

I came to the realisation today that my wife may actually just not be interested in sex.  I'm initiating pretty much all the time and the rejection or dashed hopes have finally taken their toll.  As above, when we do have sex, it feels like she's just waiting for it to be over.  The only non-missionary thing we do is touching / masturbating each other for about a minute as foreplay.  Everything else hasn't been done for a decade or will never happen.

There's so much sexuality I want to explore and I just feel like it would never happen, and if it did then it'd be a reluctant acceptance just to shut me up.

I'm really lost for what to do next.. I don't want to feel like this or be in this type of relationship but yet love her to death and only want for her to be as sexually interested as I am.  I feel that I'm at the stage where I just have to give up on all the things I want to try and settle (for lack of a better word) with the situation I have.

DB after first year, but didn't realize it until the last 1.5 years. Now I've been single for ~1 year.*

I've [25M] been dating this new girl [22F] for about 2 months, and we've seen each other probably 15-20 times in that period. She came over on Saturday afternoon before we were to go out in the evening and we ended up watching Harry Potter 3 while spooning on the couch. A movie we've each seen a dozen times. I begin kissing her neck, pulling her hips into me; she can tell I'm hard. No response. I work at it a little bit more, put my hand under her shirt. 

She tells me ""Stop, I'm trying to watch the movie""

Me: ""Yeah, but we've both seen this a million times""

Her: ""Well, I don't want to do anything""

And I just shut down. Total flashback to my DB. I felt awful. Got a pit like feeling in my stomach. I was used to that feeling, but it wasn't one that I thought I'd ever feel again.

Sure, it wasn't the most romantic of events. But we picked this movie *because* neither of us actually cared about watching it. And shouldn't we be jumping each other's bones in this honeymoon phase of the relationship?

I'm hoping to get there but as of now I'm just frustrated and am having trouble justifying the application of solutions like ""scrub-sponge"" as I think it digs me deeper into some of my complaints. 

But I digress, we have been married for over ten years and have 4 kids. When we do have sex, it is pretty spectacular, nothing too kinky but when it happens my side the emotional connection is very high. We get very ""no, THAT was the best one ever."" and that parlay's into a good 2-3 days of sex, mostly quickies in the bathroom. Then life happens, we get tired and it stops. It seems that we either forget we had a connection or it was only physical and camouflaged the lack of one. 

Her boyfriend previous to me was completely whipped, she enjoys the position of authority and I've probably let it define our relationship too much to get back. I consider myself lucky to have her, she is very pretty and amazing body in spite of 4 kids. Reasons for not having sex are being too tired to clean up, too much other stuff in the house to do, or when she is feeling really hurtful or retaliatory I'll get a ""I have zero emotional connection to you, you disgust me."" I am aware that she knows how to cut deep, I don't think she means it. Honestly, I feel like the girl sometimes because I really want to have in-bed sex or make out with a lot of touching. She'll do a quicky from behind in the bathroom which is terrific but I've told her before that coming is my least favorite part of sex with her. I will sometimes be ""punished"" if I am not kind or helpful enough, if I breathe impatiently (sometimes intentionally) or my tone is not supportive by being given more chores or events taken from me. 

Additionally, I have been reading the posts about the love languages book. I am VERY responsive to touch and words of which I get NONE. She has initiated sex 3 times since we've been married and absolutely NEVER complements me when it's just the two of us. The perception of our happy marriage is important to her so she will compliment me to others or tell me a story of how she did. 

 - I am not sure I like the -do all her work so she appreciates you. I work full time, she is a mother/homemaker. I am the only one who empties/loads the dishwasher, I take care of all pets, mow the lawn, put away laundry and a lot of home improvement projects. I think this would further feed her ""earn me"" view of her role in the relationship.
 - The exude confidence so she is attracted to you appeals to me. I'm a little chubby and balding and not sure I have the time to do anything do justify any rise in my confidence. I am flirted with at work but I think it's only because I'm the harmless married guy. 
 - She has friends who are divorced. She see's that it's painful for the kids and that the girl usually has to find work. I think I'm a success-object (as opposed to sex-object) and I'm being used to fill in the blanks of her stay at home life. 

I am a little all over the place. Again, I'm hoping to use this post to get some feedback and organize my thoughts. I'd like to get female or LL feedback on approach to break free of this cycle.

The first year was great, we had sex everytime we saw eachother and I had those butterflies in my stomach thinking about the next time we would get together, 
there was lots of dirty text messages and flirting, life was good.
Fast forward to the present day, 1 year and half in a dying bedroom feeling very unsatisfied, frustrated and becoming more and more resentful.

I have tried the following to tell my partner that I'm not satisfied with our sex life: At the start when I noticed our sex diminishing, I had a non judgemental talk with him asked if there was anything wrong, he assured me it was just new job stress and not to worry.
After 4-6months of starting the job, we were still only having sex once a month, for 5 minutes.
I sat down with him and asked about his masturbating habits, porn, etc.
He said he didn't watch porn, but he does because I snooped and I found it, heck I even left my video recorder on and he was masturbating while I was showering.
I found porn on his computer, at times when I was in the shower, or sleeping in the next room, all optimal times for sex, and I'm always willing. 
Finally, I told him, that I didn't mind if he watches porn,but only when we are not together and IF it doesn't effect our sex life ( ie no initiating on his behalf, refusing blow jobs, lack of interest).

Well, that didn't work because I'm 99.9% sure he still watches porn and our sexlife is still dead. 
I sat him down AGAIN, asked him to watch '' your brain on porn'' talked about trying not to masturbate for one week to see if it kickstarts his mojo. His response '' don't force things, just let them happen''.

Well, here I am, trying not to force things, trying to let this just ''happen'' and I am becoming more and more paranoid and resentful every day. I'm so convinced he masturbates before work that when he wakes up before me, I check the trash can when he's in the shower, too see if there is any 'evidence'.
 I'm so resentful that he doesn't seem to care about our sex life that sometimes I just have to literally bite my tongue because I'm afraid that I'm going to snap and let loose on him.

I've asked him straight out what turns him on,what can I do for him, he doesn't have any fetishes, he says he always sees me  and feels horny, but he doesn't act on it.
I'm always ready for him, I keep myself in great shape, I get regular bikini waxes, nails and hair are always well kept, I'm open to anything in the bedroom, just last week I offered him a blowjob twice on different days and he just shrugged,said no, like I was offereing him a cup of coffee.
I like anal, I always have the lube ready in the locker beside our bed.
I have suggested to him to get a work up of bloods, including testosterone, if he does it, that will be a miracle, but I don't think it's a hormonal problem because he masturbates.

The things that I have noticed about him is that he doesn't like talking about sex, at all, he will avoid the subject, cause arguments when I bring it up.
He says he's horny but he doesn't know why he doesn't go for it when he feels the urge.

I know people are going to suggest couples counselling, and I have told him that if it doesn't improve by December, we are going to try it, but I know my guy and I just don't see him talking to a stranger about our sexlife, when he can't even talk to me.

I am in a DB relationship and I am 21f years old. I have a HL and so did my 25 year old boyfriend in the beginning of our relationship. We would have sex 2-3 times a day when we saw each other (we were originally long distance) and it was very passionate. Now, we have been together for a little over a year and we don't have sex. We don't even really make out. It's super rare.

He has really bad anxiety about different things in life, and it seems like sex is now one of them. Since we were long distance, we didn't have sex as often as a regular couple so his stamina was a little on the lower side, which was fine and I never said ANYTHING about it. His anxiety started to worsen and he was depressed for a time so he went on a medication that completely shattered his libido. He could not get an erection. He stopped taking the medication and eventually he could maintain an erection again. But by that point, he had worked himself up negatively about maintaing an erection and pleasing me so much that it became and anxiety-driven activity. We didn't have sex more.

I have tried talking to him about it but every time I do, he gets upset and agitated. If I try making moves on him, he rejects me or says I am pressuring him. I really don't want to pressure him. It makes me feel horrible that it feels like I have to force him into being physical with me. I asked him if he still feels a desire to be physical with me and he said yes and I asked him then why don't you act on it? He said it is because of his anxiety but he is going to therapy for it.

I don't know what to do. This situation is literally depressing me. I feel ugly, unwanted, and sad all the time. We don't even really make out anymore. The times that we are physical, he is wasted out of his mind or high. It makes me feel like a piece of shit knowing he has to be obliterated in order to make love to me. I'm 21, I should be having a lot of sex. I should be able to happily jump my boyfriend and not feel like a dick for doing so.

1372157250.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,1h141l,Think I've got a dying bedroom here,18,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1h141l/think_ive_got_a_dying_bedroom_here/,"I've been with the same girl, well woman now I suppose, since I was 19 and she was 21. That was 15 years ago and we've been married for the last 8 years.

As time went on we both gained a bit of weight, for her it was 20 or so pounds. For me it was 80+ pounds. A nasty scare with a non-life threatening heart condition got me moving back in the right direction and I eventually lost all that weight. Hey, who knew that a better diet and plenty of exercise would do that! My wife picked up my love of running and lost her little bit of weight and toned up too. 

We had a typical married/long lerm relationship sex life, doing it 1-2 times a week on average and a lot more when on holiday. 

In the last couple of years a few things happened that have put a crimp in things. 

1) We had our first (and so far only) child, I completely understand that having a kid can put a dampener on your sex life, not helped by my wife needing an incision to get the baby out which needed in the experienced midwife's words ""A lot of stitches"". I was up front to my wife and told her that I was happy to wait until she felt ready to try sex again. We had the odd go in the first 9-10 months but it wasn't a turn on to see the love of your life grimace in pain when you try and enter her following a long foreplay session and while using lube. In the last month or two she is finally at the point where it doesn't hurt to enter her and she is enjoying sex again. However we are now finding it hard to find the time to fit in sex. Most often we used to make love first thing in the morning (aka 10am ish) at the weekend, as you can imagine an infant waking up at 5/6am sort of puts a dampener on that. Nap time at the weekend is used to get jobs done around the flat or catch up on sleep ourselves. By the time evening rolls around she's flagging, is in no mood for full sex and even when she's willing to try and finish me off another way she tends to fall asleep while doing so.

2) My Dad died suddenly, I was a mess for a quite a while and was drinking and eating a lot more and all thought of exercise went out of the window. I'm now a fatass again. Not quite as bad as before, by about 30 pounds, but enough that I'm back into my old fatso clothes again.

3) Possibly as a result of not giving a fuck following my Dad's death I got gently pushed out of my job with a 6 month payoff. Having just started calming down from binging following Dad's death this wasn't exactly what I needed. It was good to be at home with my family, but the booze/food input stayed quite high.

--------------------
In the short term there are a few things that we can try and work on to give us more time to focus on our relationship:

1) me taking up more around the household. In the past I've tended to have a lazy man approach - ask me and I'll do it, otherwise I won't bother. I have always cooked and washed up but I am now trying to help out more with the baby. My wife would be trying to frantically get jobs done before starting the baby's bath/bed routine ending up with me holding an exhausted little person while she flies around the flat in a panic. 

New plan is that I bath the baby when I get home from work, giving her time to flap around and still hopefully getting him into bed a bit earlier.

2) I'm hoping to do a charity run in my dad's memory next year, we're ordering a jogging buggy this weekend and I'm going to look closely at my diet to see what I can cut out/change to get a healthier and fitter me. Getting me and the baby out for an hour or so each day at the weekend  will allow her to get a few more bits done around the flat too.

I'm also back in work, not seeing as much of my family but earning more for a less stressful job.

----------------------

The main thing I'm worried about is that even before the baby/dad/job induced dry spell she didn't seem too interested in sex, she enjoys it when it happens but didn't seem to get into foreplay the same. We hug, french kiss etc at least once a day, but even when we are building up to sex she doesn't seem to want to reciprocate - I'll be stimulating her erogenous zones, getting obvious aroused reactions (legs parted, grinding crotch into me) but I never get any mutual play. Sex almost always devolves into foreplay (i.e. I finger/lick her till wet and ready). Then missionary/cowgirl sex until orgasm at which point she's satisfied and isn't interested in a second round. I can't remember the last time I had a blowjob either.

Sex only ever happens in bed, never the shower or any other part of the flat.

She is generally receptive to trying new thing I suggest, but never suggests things she would like to try. She claims that she doesn't have any fantasies, I tried to get her to do that upgrade your mojo website a few months back but she's never managed to find the time to do her half of the questionnaire. I guess even taking the baby out of the picture I feel that sex isn't as high up her agenda as it is for me. And of course because I'm not getting it very often sex is on my mind all the time, I feel like a teenager again at times.

I try and compliment her figure, kiss, fondle and generally show that I like what she has. I don't always mean to get myself turned on when doing this, but after a long while without sex I can't help it and often end up frustrated when she doesn't reciprocate. She also feels pressured when I get too horny which doesn't put her in the mood for loving. Then there are the odd occasions when intimacy is on the cards, but she kills the mood - as an example we were about to get it on, I had to nip back to the bathroom to grab the lube from my washbag as we'd been on holiday and hadn't finished unpacking. I got back to the bedroom to find her sat half on the bed with her head proped up with one hand with a bored expression on her face as if to say let's get this chore over with. Instant boner-kill. I don't want her having sex with me because it gets me out of her hair for a few weeks. I want to make love with her.

That or she feels gross and bloated.

It's her body, I can't tell her how she feels. I get it. 

That or her chronic fatigue puts her to sleep on the couch at 9PM. Or we need to wake up too early the next morning, or we wake up too late to do anything. Or the dogs have been alone too long and need attention. It's all reasonable. She's on a birth control that probably affects her libido. She's on a new anxiety medication that almost definitely does. She's even on an antihistamine that she says ""dries her out"", which I never considered affecting all the orifices, but hey, makes sense. I get it.

But it *sucks*.

She feels guilty when I show frustration, which puts us both in a shitty mood. So I have to swallow it.  I don't want to add to all of the rest of her problems.

We live together, have a dog, go to school, etc. And I have a problem....I have a incredibly low libido. Don't get me wrong, but my gf is gorgeous, I'm just not really (ever) in the mood.

She gets mad at me, which I totally understand. She says that I'm ""not a lesbian"" (especially since almost a year ago she caught me watching gay male porn). But I am! I look at other girls and get turned on, and I get turned on looking at her, it's just the actual act of sex I'm really not interested in. She then cries about that I don't want her and that I don't find her attractive, which I am constantly telling her and rubbing her down talking about how sexy she is. Also, she doesn't like how I kiss. She likes to kind of slobber all over me (almost cover my whole face with her mouth) while I like to softly kiss on the lips, get a little tongue, etc.

She bitches at me about it ALL THE TIME. Actually, this morning I woke up before she left for work and within 2 minutes of me being awake, she started bitching at me about not having sex with her. I feel like a horrible person because I'm not meeting her needs, but I feel like it would be just as bad to ""fake it""? (Which I have deff done). She says to me nearly every single day ""are you going to fuck me today?!"". I just can't handle the pressure.

So some history, I was a incredibly sexual person when I first met her, but I also was a bit of a party animal, so those two characteristics went hand in hand. Well she doesn't drink or like to go out, so that part of my life has really died down as I don't like drinking/partying by myself. Luckily, every few months I get a free night and I go out and have a good time with my friends. Our sex life was good when we first started dating, but again, I was still a bit of a heavy drinker and she even drank from time to time then. Now nothing, she goes to bed super early, doesn't like socializing, etc.

I'm a 25 HL male and she is a 26 LL female and we have a child together.

Seems like my dead bedroom is caused by a vicious cycle that we go through anytime any intimacy shows up. See even though we have been together for 4 years and have a child, we are not married. So anytime sex comes up, she brings up marriage.

I don't want to go into marriage with a dead bedroom. So anytime sex starts coming up, she gets upset because we aren't married yet. I don't want to marry her because we have absolutely zero intimacy. Sex twice a year, and we sleep in different bedrooms. That is not how I want to live. But anytime I try to communicate about it, she says well maybe if we were married and I had a husband, etc. I don't want to take the risk that after marriage the dead bedroom will continue right along. So I have started avoiding sex just to avoid talking about marriage and I end up jerking off every night after she goes to bed, even sometimes when she's in busy in the other room during the day..

I don't believe that pregnancy is the problem as this was existing before we found out.  My boyfriend says that he is interested in sex and that he wants it but he never shows anything at all that would make me believe that.  

I have tried to pursue his fantasies - some of which he unconvincingly declined.  I know he likes being more submissive in the bedroom and prefers me to be the one ""taking"" him, but I am also a fan of being the submissive one too.  I like different things and variety but the only time we engage in sex is when I am the one initiating it and making all the effort.  I have assumed the dominant role and engaged in some play that I know he enjoys, but he won't reciprocate for my pleasure.  

I let him know what I like and even sent him links to porn that demonstrate how I like to be touched and reading materials.  I have offered him a threesome with another girl as he admits that it is every guys fantasy (his polite way of saying its one of his) but he has backed out of it once i became more serious about making it happen.  I've tried to talk about it many times but it has gotten me nowhere.  

We have now not had sex in over a month and it is because I have not initiated it.  He has said that he wants sex and has wanted it in this last month but I haven't seen evidence of it at all.

1368085364.0,17,self.DeadBedrooms,1dzn50,To those who say you've started out great having sex... [Rant],21,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1dzn50/to_those_who_say_youve_started_out_great_having/,"I hate all of you. Not entirely, but I am jealous of the fact. At least you had some sort of sexual relationship. Then again... I guess it is harder to have had something and lost it.

I didn't even bother making a throwaway account, I don't care if she sees this. I've had ""A Talk"" with her every time more than a week of no physical contact happens. I've even linked her some DB things and she came crying to my room thinking I was going to dumb her.

I've browsed here long enough to know all the stories. ""Yea we love each other, I'm HL she's LL, everything's great except for...""

I'm up at 3AM when I need to get up in 5 hours for work, she's sleeping next to me. It's my last night being at college before I have to move for work all summer long. Nope, no sexual interest. 

I literally cannot sleep because of the burning emptiness of the vortex of emotion consuming the center-right part of my left lung. On nights like these, she falls asleep at 12 and I lay staring at the ceiling until divine intervention takes away my consciousness at 5AM. She only stays here like 2-3 nights a week. She would stay longer but she can't be hassled by my needs, she feels guilty rejecting me.

We've tried like 3 times in our 1 &amp; 7mnth, (It took her a year to say she loved me, only after I let it slip and she had to think about it...)  only trying it after about 13 months into the relationship, she has a mental repulsion that prevents her from having sex, it effects her physically. It hurts her, and I care too much to hurt her, physically or mentally. Of course, I can't help but hurt her emotionally being the frustrated HL. Yes, she's on BC, has been since like 14.

I love doing whatever I can to make her intimately happy. When she's ""In a hurry"" I have to beg her to let me get her, she only agrees by saying she doesn't have time to get me. I understand, It's finals, point is, ITS ALWAYS SOMETHING, those things are a bigger priority to her than I am, a lot of things are, I'm like number 4 on her list. Regardless if it's true or not, we all know the feels.

It's gotten to the point where I just don't even bother to initiate at times. I mean, the stars might actually be in alignment for the night, and I just don't even care, all that's going to happen is I'll pour all of my passion into the 4 minutes it takes me to get her. She's a one and done gal, and I'll get a sad hand job.--You know like that card against humanity card that everyone says ""awh that's so sad"" to, yea.-- When I ask if I can get anything extra she just looks at me with a face that looks like a homeless person just hit on her, with a small hint of pain. You know the one.

But, I do care to have physical intimacy, I know, and I hope to God she at least knows by now. When she asks ""What's wrong,"" she has to know. I would honestly be disappointed if she didn't actually know what was wrong. The paradox is that no physical intimacy makes HL people a bitch, which is certainly not attractive, which makes intimacy even harder. I hate how I get after its been a while, I literally can't drive myself to do much of anything. As part of that there's ""You know how I get,"" been distant and not very enthusiastic all day, I wonder why,? we've only been over this once a week.

To sleepless nights my DBers! Masturbating only puts me down, especially when she's around.

I typed this entire thing hoping that she'd wake up. Nah, she can sleep through everything, even my uncomfortable tossing and turning throughout the night and my exasperated sighs.

Please, if you do happen to read this, know that every time you ask me ""What's wrong?"" I feel a thistle weed nail jabbing at my heart and crawling up my throat.

1366229476.0,17,self.DeadBedrooms,1ck0ks,Is he asexual...?,23,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1ck0ks/is_he_asexual/,"I started dating an old friend from high school about six months ago. He's a nice guy and I like him a lot, and in the beginning of our relationship, we had a lot of sex and I found it very satisfying. Lately, however, he's been completely uninterested. 
 
At first, sex with him was very satisfying. We'd have sex at least once a day (I'm a very sexual person and like to have sex at least once a day if possible) and even though I didn't cum every time, the intimacy was there and I felt like all my needs were being met. He was very into me and having sex with me, and we would do everything from full-on coitus to going down on me to fingering me, whatever. I'd give him hand jobs or blow jobs and sometimes we'd try different positions. All in all, good stuff.

Within the last couple of months, however, he seems to have lost all interest in sex. Every other aspect of our relationship is still there, but whenever I try to turn him on or ask for sex, he says he's too tired or too distracted or too busy. I know he isn't cheating on me--in fact, it almost feels like he's gotten his fill of sex for this year or something and doesn't need to do anything intimate again for awhile. He doesn't even want to touch my breasts or make out, both of which are things I really like and will accept instead of sex if he's not in the mood.

I feel kind of silly about being in this position because he sort of warned me about this up front. We've both had one other sexual partner in our life, and his last sexual relationship ended three years ago. During that time, he said he didn't miss sex at all and that sex isn't really something he cares about very much. I guess I didn't believe him at the time because he seemed to like it at the beginning of our relationship--I thought maybe I'd ""cured"" him of his blase attitude towards sex. Guess not.

The sex got steadily worse as time went on, too. He gets distracted *super* easily--something as benign as the dog getting up from his bed and walking to the other side of the room can ruin the mood for him. He usually isn't interested enough to sustain foreplay--I often ask him to fondle my breasts or something because I really like that, and he'll paw at one of them for a couple of seconds before answering a text or saying he'd rather read a book or something. 

I'm trying not to be pushy about this--I know he acted this way somewhat with his last girlfriend, and she said and did some hurtful things (including cheating) which may have given him something of a complex. I don't want to make it worse for him, but it's been a month and a half since we last had sex. I don't mean to brag, but I'm in great shape and I'm a very attractive person, and I often reach for him in bed or meet him naked or do other things to try and turn him on. What's the deal? I'd be happy if he'd just make out with me or feel me up or something every once in a while, but I get absolutely nothing. I'm getting kind of bitter about this whole situation, too. I'm trying to stay calm and be patient around him, but I sometimes get testy and snap at him for things he doesn't deserve to be yelled at for. 
 
I've tried to talk to him about this, and he says things like, ""it really hasn't been that long since we had sex"" or ""well, we'll have sex tonight then!"" but he's never in the mood when the time comes and it *has* been that long! I've wasted an entire month of birth control pills because we haven't been having any sex. He left on a business trip a few days ago, and I told him a week before his departure that I really wanted to have sex at some point before he left. He promised we would, but it never happened. Now he's going to be gone for the next two weeks. 

I'm also frustrated about this because my last boyfriend and I had amazing sexual chemistry. We both had some hang-ups and reservations regarding sex when we started dating, but we worked through them all together and were able to have an amazing sex life. We were experimental and spontaneous, and he couldn't be near me in an empty house for more than fifteen minutes before he needed to fuck me. I felt great, wanted, and appreciated. Now I just feel...kind of insulted. I'm actually a little worried that he might be asexual. I've asked him about it, and he says that there's no way, but if you never care whether you have sex or not, doesn't that make you asexual...?

We have 3 children. The oldest is 6, the youngest two are 2. The first few years we were married were a long term honey-moon. She said she was satisfied, I definetly was. Over time, she became less and less interested in sex to the point where she later admitted that she would prefer shopping for shoes over sex of any type. She said she understood my need, but has very rarely supported it. I can literally remember the 12 times we've had sex over the last 5 years, including the attempt at a second child which resulted in twins and zero pregnant sex at all. I work sometimes 60 hours a week in a high stress job, she stays at home and plays Mommy -&gt;  I admit to being jealous of the amount of time she gets with the kids. I'm 6'1"" and 180lbs and try to stay somewhat fit and am blessed with a very high metabolism. I believe I'm physically desireable. I do all the 'dirty' chores including taking out trask, bathrooms, dishes, folding and putting away all laundry. I'm also the default diaper changing guy as soon as I get home from work too. She alsways tells me she loves me and can't imagine her life without me. I love her too, but am more often finding myself fantasizing about leaving with the hope of finding more understanding, similiar interests, love, and sex. I can't imagine ever being without my kids or what it would do to my kids if I was to leave. We don't argue about things loudly. There's no loud verbal exchanges of any kind for the kids to hear. We often have discussions about things. I regularly bring up sex and have become accustomed to an irritated sigh in return. I've tried flirting, masage, making dinner, cleaning the house for her, sending her out to spend time with the girls while I watch the kids, gifts and flowers. I'm regularly accused of cheating. I've never cheated on anyone in my life physically. I say physically because she perceives watching porn as cheating, which I have been sneaking in regularly without her knowledge as I have been attempting to take care of my own sexual needs. She will on occasion walk by and start heavily petting and kissing me and promise fun later in the evening only to immediately change her mind when we do lay down. This is incredibly frustrating as I am unable to sleep with a raging hard-on and eventually have to slink away during the night after she falls asleep to satisfy my own need. 
She suffers from severe anxiety which she is finally going to receive counseling for, but also feels ashamed of. She refuses any medication offered by the doctor. The kids are very difficult and draining to deal with, particularly the twins, and I understand this, but still greatly desire her intimate company night after night. We seem to have grown apart physically as well as personally. She constantly berates my hobbies (musical interests, video games, camping/backpacking) as being too childish. I do not play video games when the kids are awake and generally don't play at night until after I've been rejected again my her and only for 2 or 3 hours a night maybe twice a week at most. I only bring up the gaming issue as I was much more addicted to gaming before kids and have refused to let it take up so much of my time as to set an example for the kids. I regularly let her sleep in on the weekends to give her some time to relax, but she will complain that I let her sleep too long or that I don't let her get enough sleep. I'll make her breakfast in the morning to ease the morning grumpy time. I regularly take her shopping &lt;which she loves more than anything&gt; even though I hate large crowds at commercial outlets. I've even learned how to behave like I'm enjoying my self during those shopping excursions to the point that I've almost convinced myself. I initiate conversation and ask questions, but am finding that I seem to annoy her with my sexual desires. If I could even get a few times a week, life could be so much better.

I'm 34 of average libido (ML?) with a beautiful LL wife that I've been with for umm... some time over 10 years, making love once every 2 weeks or so. Here are some things I've learned:

* Religion helps. Whoa! Hold off the downvotes! Most religions have some teachings about how sex is really important during marriage. Get a book (for 'us', not her!) on your respective religion. This at least emphasizes to her the importance of sex and ensures we make an effort.

* Sex starts first thing in the morning and lasts until evening. We plan it ahead of time. The whole day involves various levels of romance such as hanging out washing together or getting high on large amounts of chocolate.

* Keep the pressure off. Take an attitude of ""I'm happy that you're here with me"". It's hard, but try not to pout, get annoyed, get frustrated, rage, sulk, etc. An appropriate reaction is ""I'm disappointed, but I still love you."". Go in with the expectation that it's not going to happen anyway, so you're not setting yourself up with disappointment. This is a long-term thing; pressure kills libido, and you need her to learn that it doesn't matter too much if she doesn't perform so that she doesn't feel pressure when the opportunity arises.

* Take it slowly and be patient. You might need to plan beforehand so you have time. Chat for a while first. Give a massage, then flip her over and massage the other side as well. Get the chocolate sauce out, etc. Good luck. Remember - no pouting when she decides it's sleeping time instead.

* Don't leave it too long. I don't know if it applies to all women, but my wife tends to completely lose interest if I leave it too long, and conversely is usually more receptive for a few days after intercourse.

I love my wife very much, and although the sex is terrible, I do appreciate and admire her other qualities as a partner.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1ary3w,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1ary3w/some_things_that_i_find_help/,

But when I posted my frustrations on here before, I just can't take the advice of give the ultimatum of him putting out or I'm going to cheat.  We worked too hard on our marriage, our communication, and our relationship to get to a good place in EVERYTHING but sex for me to throw it all out with some crappy kneejerk response.

Everything I said was in I  statements.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, started with ""You"".  There was absolutely no blame placed.  I told him that I felt loved, I felt his affection, and I loved the little things he does to ""take care of me"" (like make my morning coffee).  I told him it feels like he pulls away when I try to initiate anything with him.  I told him, I felt like we could only have sex when he wanted it.  I told him I felt like I ""HAD"" to have sex with him when he wanted it (even if I didn't want to), otherwise I would miss out on my chance for the month.  

His response was reasonable as well.  He was quiet, and he said that he didn't know if he was pulling away from me.  He said he would really watch his actions/reactions to see if he was and if he could figure out why he would be doing that.  He said that it wasn't fair that I felt like this, and that he would work on it with me.

I don't know the end result.  It's that time for me, and it's the one time of the month that I DO NOT want sex.  

I do know though that instead of an ultimatum with tears and ugliness, my husband has been even more affectionate, told me repeatedly how much he loves me the last couple days, and we've felt quite close and comfortable.

Girlfriend 24(f) and I 26(m) have been dating for a little over a year. Usual story, in the beginning everything was amazing in terms of our sex life, going at it like rabbits, experimenting, positions, dirty texts, etc. After 6-7 months, she moved in with me and things continued to be great. Of course, after the honeymoon phase (10 months or so) things slowed down and I noticed she stopped with the dirty texts, her initiating became less frequent, less spontaneity, etc. essentially we got into a routine of sex before bed. I tried my best to step up my game and make up for her decline but I started to get rejected, which I wasnt used to at all. I would continue with the usual pattern of sexting etc, but the answers would come back rather unenthusiastic or she would ignore them all together, claiming she was just busy at work. When we first started dating we talked about sex and how we have high sex drives, wanting or needing sex every day if not every other day. We would discuss our friends relationships who were only doing it 1-2 times per week and how we would never want to be that infrequent. 

Her way of rejecting me started to get under my skin. I would try to kiss her when we first got in bed and she would give me ""pecks"" back, no passion or enthusiasm. I would kinda let up, getting the hint that she wasnt in the mood and she would ask ""Oh you want to do it? Ok, we can do it, get on top of me"" which can only be summed up as what felt like pity sex. We would still have exciting sex during the weekend but this type of rejection started happening more and more during the week. Eventually I spoke up and said ""I really dont like it when you ask me that, of course I want to have sex with you which is why I'm making a move. If you are into it just go with it, if not thats fine"". That talk really didn't change much and eventually I decided that pressuring her in any way for sex was a bad idea and I started to significantly drop off how much I would initiate. 

Time went by and I would rarely try to have sex with her at night during the week but I could tell she still knew I wanted it because of past discussions on sex drives, expectations etc. What happened next was that she started saying she was tired from work and exercising during the week and really didnt really like doing it weekdays (she works 9-5). She said she doesnt want to have ""long sex"" during the week so if we did, ""can i come quick?"". Her fallback was that on the weekends she would have her normal drive so this shouldnt be a big deal. I let it go, maybe twice during the week right before bed she would ask me ""oh wanna do it?"" I would ask her back ""do you?"", she goes ""can you come quick?"", I'll reply back ""maybe"" and then she says ""get on top of me"". As in I have to do all the work, shes too tired to put any effort in. To me, this translates to get on top of me and lets get this over with. Its effectively ""duty sex"" which I think 1 year into a relationship at 26 years old is a little ridiculous.

This ""get on top off me and can you come quick?"" initiations of hers started creeping into the weekend but I kept my mouth shut for a couple of months and just let it happen, still convinced that making a deal out of it would just make things worse. During this time I initiate once every week and a half or so and on those days, making sure its a progressive buildup of trying to get her in the mood, only to still get rejected. Even on Valentines day, she fell asleep and woke up with me turning the lights off and said ""its Valentines day were supposed to do it"", I said ""dont worry you're sleeping, tomorrow we can"", to her saying ""can you come in 2 minutes?"". 

This all built up to last night where she asked the same question before we went to bed, ""get on top of me?"" I said OK. As I'm getting on top of her, she says ""I have one more request, can you come quick?"". My response, ""me on top, 5 minutes, got it"". But then something happened, she asked me a question I didnt want to answer but had to ""is that mean of me?"". I looked at her, feeling an opportunity and said ""can I be completely honest? I hear it more often than I like to"". She looked at me, blinked and said ""fine then you're not getting any tonight"". I looked at her in disbelief as she turned the light off. I turned around and said ""ok fine"". I couldn't believe she could be that cold and dismissive. After 5 minutes of laying in silence, I turned to her and tried to talk about the situation but it was just a mess, her getting defensive, attacking me, etc. I told her I dont mind having quickies during the week, I'm not upset with the frequency of our sex but I would like my girlfriend to be a little more enthusiastic about having sex with me. The enthusiasm comment lit a fire under her ass because she then went off and said ""fine we'll stop having sex at all and only when I'm feeling enthusiastic about it"". I told her shes using sex as a punishment and she said I'm doing it to myself if I'm not happy with how shes ""putting out"". 

Reddit, I just want my girlfriend to have some passion and enthusiasm. Shes not making an effort to try and turn me on, be seductive, kiss me, etc. If she would do all of those things and then right before say ""but I'm going to make you come quick cause I have an early day tomorrow"" it would be completely fine. At least shes showing interest in me and the act. Do we have passionate sex still? Yes but only on the weekends and that is starting to become less and less frequent, getting replaced by this ""lets just get it over with"" type of scenario. This morning she was trying to be sweet and said lets talk tonight when we get home. What the hell do I say? I want her to know that I value quality over quantity and that I dont want her to feel pressured into having sex with me because I dont even initiate anymore. Really, I just want her to be ""present"" when she does decide to have sex and do it for herself and not just to satisfy what she perceives as some chore or obligation. What should I say to her tonight without making this situation worse????

Sidenotes: I keep myself in really good shape, workout daily, have my own life. We share hobbies together and apart from each other. Our relationship outside of this issue is relatively perfect.

We have been married for the past two years. When we were dating the romance was electric and often and we both loved it. But then the wedding happened...

I guess I should have taken it as a sign when we didn't make love on our wedding night... or day after, but I just knew we were both exhausted from all the events of the day to really want to get down that night and I knew she was exhausted from it all even more than I was. Over the past two years since then the sex and all other romantic contact has come to a screeching halt. And after we got pregnant the sex stopped completely.

I know some of this is on me as I turned to porn to quell my HL. I was having to finish myself 5ish times a week and I was becoming really depressed about it. When I talked with my wife about it all she would communicate that she was going to start giving a better effort, but it has never happened. 

I decided to go nofap since before my child was born in late September. It has greatly improved my cognition and my desire to try and woo my wife, but in all my attempts nothing has resulted in sex of any kind. I am getting so fed up and frustrated and I have communicated that to her. She understands where I am coming from but says she ""doesn't think I deserve it because I am not as romantic as I once was.""

I decided this Valentine's day to go all out. Got her some of her favorite food, card, flowers. I have been working from home a lot so I have helped a lot with my baby, cleaned the place up more than usual, and tried my hardest to make her feel special for the day. In return I go to take a break from working and come on to her a bit and flirt. Her first reaction is to tell me to get some gum (fair enough I was eating some garlic in my lunch) but then proceeds to ask why I forgot to take out the trash this morning. It wasn't a big deal, no fight or anything as we don't really fight at all, but I knew it was a tactic to avoid romance. She does stuff like this all the time. It has made me sick to my stomach and I have no idea what I'm suppose to do about it. I love her with all my heart and I love our child and I would never end things. 

But when all this communicating that I have been encouraged to do from this subreddit and others, results in nothing in return except her telling me what I want to hear and that we would get better on the romance front followed by absolutely nothing happening... it is just so frustrating to see all my efforts go to waste and with the nofap going on for a long long while I am just afraid I am going to explode. I am getting so sexually frustrated that it is making me bitter. And I very much notice a change in my personality making me bitter about my other coupled friends.  

So basically I am just writing this out instead of going back into the room with her and fighting back tears of how terrible I think our marriage is, when she thinks it is perfect. She knows I am unhappy, but doesn't want to meet me half way. My only option I think is to try and convince her to go see if she has a hormonal imbalance that was cause by our wedding... sounds crazy but it seems that a switch was flipped that day and my life has been slowly getting more miserable ever since.

It will be a year in February since my girlfriend of 3 years and I had sex. We were each other's first, and at the start it was around 3-4 times a week which was fantastic. 

It dwindled down slowly to what it is now - nothing, no affection in any way - we don't hold hands and sometimes we don't kiss each other goodnight, we spend a lot of time with each other though but I can't help feeling I may just be starting to love her less.

I've brought it up a bunch of times with her which either has 1 of 2 responses: 

1 - All you care about is sex etc. This ends up being an argument

2 - I'm sorry, it really hurts but it's my fault and we should try more (she's actually been to the doctor's twice to try and diagnose this, so it's not a lie I don't think but at the start it hurt, but she said just for the first 5 seconds or so).

Thing is, we've had such a great time together, and had some amazing experiences - her family are great to me, and mine to her too I guess.

21M/F dating over three years, living together for the majority. We get along great, have similar humour/interests/goals and shit, can share silent times together and all that other crap that suggests a positive long term relationship.

I am bitter as all fuck about our sex life.

When we were first going out, we (she) waited 2 months before sex, which was totally fine by me. I really like the girl. At first it was quite frequent and enjoyable, but things went south after about 2 months more.

She has body image issues (which I get is a whole other thing, but I digress), and at first it ""hurt"". I'm pretty average in size, so I was always a big suspicious of this, and it ended sex early more times than I care to remember. After a while, I assumed it was my technique causing the problems, because as much as I'd love to believe, it wasn't my size. -1 self esteem point.

We used to have sex whenever, wherever. Bathroom of a restaurant, a park (until we were interrupted by a freak dust storm), whatever. A few months later, we can't even do it with the fucking lights on. This basically narrows location down to the bedroom as fucking in the kitchen with no light is bullshit. -1 intimacy point.

About a year in, I realised we were down to about 3x a month, got her to do the mojoupgrade quiz. She acted enthusiastic but nothing ever came of it. I tried initiating a few of the things she said she was wanting, but was either met with excuses or a decidedly lukewarm reception. -1 trust point.

Going back a little, around the 6 month to 1 year mark, there were all these bullshit medical problems. I swear to fucking god, it was always something. Stomach, temperature, headache, tired, tired, tired, fever, nausea, dizziness. You name it.

Sex has always been vanilla as fuck, which is fine by me. I have no fetishes or kinks to speak of. I could do a beautiful woman in missionary for the rest of my life and be happy. Problem? The fact that the lights are always off means I could be fucking anyone and I wouldn't know the difference. I can't even use toys on her properly because I can't see what the fuck I'm doing.

Foreplay? Yeah, I go down on her to success every single time. How often is the favour returned? Maybe one in 5 if I'm lucky. How many times has she succeeded? Once. Does it feel good anyway? No. Have I tried coaching her? Yep.

Anyway, I've raised my concerns with her many times. She will always ""make an effort in future"" and she does. For a week or two. Then it's back to normal. I can barely even think of her as sexy any more. I'm not allowed to see her naked. To this day.

What makes me so bitter? She was comfortable to have a FFM threesome with her friend and friend's SO not long before we met, but I get fuck all after years together.

I just needed to vent. I don't know what I hope to get out of this, but fuck, I feel better already.

We starting dating in 2010 and the lack of physical intimacy was always chalked up to him saying that he just wasn't touchy, or he was tired/stressed, etc.  Throughout the dating relationship, we only saw each other once a week, so when sex only happened once a month, I guess I just equated that we had sex 25% of the time we were together, so when we decided to live together it'd even out to be 1-2 times per week or more.  Right.


So long story short, we got engaged and stopped all physical intimacy for religious reasons.  I wasn't necessarily 100% thrilled with doing so, but it was important to him, so I went with it.  We were engaged for about a year before getting married and didn't have sex, oral, or any manual stimulation from one another for about 8-9 months of that year.


For the first week of marriage, it was great.  We had sex 3-4 times that week, but as soon as that week was over, things went south. We've been married for 10 months now and have sex about once every 4-6 weeks.  He puts his arm around me at night and we kiss and hold hands, but there isn't any passion behind anything as far as our intimacy goes.


Thus far:

* We've had the talk more times than I can count

* Been involved in couples counselling for about 7 weeks now

* I've written him a long, 6 page letter detailing exactly how I feel

* Given suggestions for things that I'd like from him

* Asked him about his fantasies and offered to do *anything* he desires

* Had his T levels tested a few times (he's 450-550)


So many times, we've had ""the talk"" and he gets upset and hates himself for not trying and swears up and down that things will change... and I believe him every time.  He's so genuine with his apologies and seems to really empathize with my feelings and understand where I'm coming from, but then after that, nothing ever changes.  And we go a few months until I'm so broken inside that we finally have ""the talk"" all over again.  


Rinse, repeat.


It's gotten to the point that I feel disconnected from him emotionally a lot.  I just feel so alone and sad and rejected and I don't understand how he never seems to think about sex.  I just don't get it.  He doesn't look at porn, doesn't masturbate, we're not having sex, etc.  I've never seen him wake up with a hard on and he's never mentioned having any ""dirty"" dreams, says he doesn't have any fantasies, no specific desires to try anything new in the bedroom, etc. I feel like some kind of pervert and am ashamed of my sex drive most of the time.


I used to text him pictures or dirty messages, hit on him, or touch him... but I never do anymore.  Being pushed away every time has just completely killed my desire to reach out.  I lay in bed next to him at night and when he's turned away, think about how nice it would feel to spoon or to cuddle, but I know that if I try, he'll pull away, so I just lay in bed and pull a pillow closer to me and cry.


He's mentioned things in the heat of the moment, like getting toys for me or trying anal, but then later, completely shuts down about it.  I've tried to talk to him about buying lube, as well, but he avoids the topic or jokes about it.  Honestly, because we have sex so little, it's initially painful for me nearly every time and a little lube would be nice :(  I've expressed this and was shot down.


We're in counseling with a therapist and while I think it's helping him work through some personal/family issues from his past, it just doesn't seem to be doing anything for our situation as far as our dead bedroom is concerned.  


Over the last week, it's actually been amazing... after a 5 week dry spell, we had sex Saturday and again last night, which is the first time we've had sex back-to-back in that short a time period since the week of our wedding.  I want to be excited about that, but I'm so discouraged that I feel like I can't because I'm just expecting it to go right back to nothing for a month or more.  I don't feel like he even *looks* at me like ""that"".  I see other guys give me a once over, or stare at my chest, or look at my ass, but I never see his eyes linger on me like that... like he *wants* me.  Sigh.  I don't even know where I'm really going with this.


We have our next therapy appointment tonight.  I don't even know what to talk about in there anymore.


So... Hey, I guess.

I feel that my wife 35 now gets all of her affection needs from our 4yo daughter and has been since her birth. Her maternal instinct is prioritising that relationship and she has no intention to redress the balance.

As a family we function brilliantly, but we are just mother and father now, not lovers.

I've raised the subject of our dead bedroom a few times, and she has suggested it is the usual self esteem, stress &amp; tiredness problems and feeling pressured. I've backed off initiating, but the others are not within my influence.

my main point is that i don't believe she wants to fix the problem. I sense that she feels that intimacy with me betrays her relationship with our daughter. i am not jealous, but i need more from her to justify my commitment.

has anyone else come to a similar conclusion?

We have been together for 11 years, married for 7 and have two kids aged 7 and 4. We had a normal sex life for a few years at the start and then i began abusing porn, it's a pattern that has been present in all my previous relationships and all have failed because of it.

I love my wife dearly and i am sexually attracted to her but i basically destroyed her self confidence by not being there sexually for her for the 7 years we have been married. We went for 6 months and even longer without sex (1.5yrs was the longest) however when we did, i enjoyed it immensely. We had the ""talk"" several times in the past but i always slipped by the wayside (none of us has cheated, other than me with the porn)

About 9 months ago i decided i had to change my behaviour, i started picking up my share on the chores, be attentive, listen to my wife and look after her and the kids needs. I also gave up porn and controlled the masturbation so my desire to have sex with my wife returned with a vengeance.

At first my wife was quite receptive and we were having good sex again, however my wife still had huge issues with her self esteem, she obviously is full of questions as well. So over the last 9 months stuff has been coming out, i have been honest with her about the use of porn and she is understandably very upset. She feels like i have been cheating and it's causing issues again with sex.

Last week was terrible, we were about to have sex and i lost my erection, i felt the wrong vibes from her and she flipped out and so did i. Sex is still very fragile between us. The next day we were exchanging texts and the extent of the damage i have caused over the last 7 years came out. This was a breaking point, whatever confidence had been instilled was now removed.

She told me that the physical side was over, for ever, she would stick with me for the sake of the kids and that's it. No being buddies any more, nothing. I was utterly devastated, ashamed, guilty, That was on Wednesday. We didn't talk much until the Friday, we both had a long talk then and basically ended the marriage there and then. We would agree to stay together for the kids. I did ask if she still loved me and she said she didn't know any more, she didn't know who she was any more, i had destroyed her confidence, personality, a broken human being.

It goes without saying that i accept full responsibility for what i have done, i love her dearly and i am so ashamed that i stuck my head in the sand for so long and then tried to turn it round in the space of a few months. Over the course of the weekend it was highs an lows for both of us i think, both thinking we can cope with this new situation and then crashing back to the reality that i had destroyed the relationship.

On Sunday morning i wrote my wife a letter and laid bare everything about myself, Sexual abuse when i was a kid, suicide attempt at 18, as some way of explaining my behaviour, i feel like a pretty messed up person but that for the last year or so i am trying and maybe trying too hard and freaking her out.

We had another long talk last night and have decided to try and get over it. She explained how she had been let down in the past, how she felt utterly worthless as a human being, didn't know who she was any more, running on autopilot, how she felt i thought she is unattractive and undesirable. I explained as best i could how i did still have those feelings for her, but she is obviously still very much broken inside.

So at the moment, we still have our marriage, she says she loves me but she cannot take any more lies or abuse of trust. I am fully committed to making it work, but i think the physical side is still a major hurdle.

I understand that my wife is going to need a lot of time to heal, she is a very strong person but i am fearful that i have permanently changed her inside. How can i help her get her confidence back without being too blatant. I feel like showering her in genuine affection constantly but i know this is not a great way to go about it. She is deeply, deeply hurt and i feel that i am the one who must take responsibility to get her back to her old, confident and sexual self, since she refuses to see a councillor.

Any advice is most welcome.

tl;dr - I destroyed my wife's confidence by withholding sex for years. Getting slowly back on track but she is still broken inside.

I had more experience than he did, and this was a point of concern for him while we were dating.

While we were dating, sex was frequent and enjoyable if not all that creative. It has always been very vanilla. As time went on and routine set in, it was harder for me to get off spontaneously and he was having trouble learning or enjoying the things I liked so that he could help get me off. He has always watched porn and enjoys that, but it always seemed like kinky stuff was ""porn stuff"" and our sex was ""regular."" I like to be more creative, but he never seemed very comfortable with that even though we would talk about it. Even so, mutual enthusiasm was still there and it wasn't hard to be or get ""in the mood.""

After we got engaged, there was a period of time that I went back to school and could only work part-time, and as a result I was completely broke. In desperation to pay my bills, I joined a website did webcam shows for money for a couple months (never anything beyond that), and he found out about it and hit the roof. He was very upset about my doing that with other men, which was understandable. But what made him the most upset was, I think, that I was doing ""porn stuff."" I made the mistake of telling him that I thought it was fun and exciting and that we could maybe do it together, and he literally went nuclear and we actually weren't engaged for a while. 

We worked through it and got married, but the quality of our sex life afterwards took a major hit. It got even more vanilla (if that was possible) and very centered on him, it got ""wham bam thank you man"" and if I brought up anything that I liked, it was turned down or met with negativity. Efforts to learn how to please me were deemed ""too difficult."" The enthusiasm turned into silence and routine. He eventually got over his anger and it's been years since then, but a lot of the bedroom habits remained like the silence and routine and lack of creativity and undercurrent of repression. I started getting incredibly frustrated because everything I tried was getting shot down, I wasn't getting satisfied, and I was being blamed for things not working out. 

I admit that it eventually made me lose my attraction and motivation to even have sex because I just don't get anything out of it at all. I can't really explain how it's almost physically painful to always get ""some of the way there"" or worse, ""most of the way there,"" only to be deprived of fulfillment every single time as the show is over and the curtains come up. It makes me angry for days. Worse, I feel like it's conditioned me to not get excited during sex because I'll just get left hanging.

Strangely enough, however, he has always been into porn and he is now complaining about the boringness and infrequency. We're now in a horrible vicious circle. He complains it's boring and too long between acts, but he still acts like he's the only one in the room and does things according to his comfort, not my enjoyment. He keeps doing porn move-type things I don't like, and it turns me off and makes me frustrated. I tell him to do it differently because I don't like it, and he gets mad. I try to get a little creative and he clams up like I'm going to anally rape him with my vibrator and post it on Xtube. Neither of us are getting any younger, so even though I'm in great shape I can't compete visually with some bleach blonde 20 year old in stripper shoes.

I pretty much resigned myself to middle-aged hobbies at this point, but a friend recently had tee many martoonis during a night out and made several forward comments and it got me all worked up for a week. So, I'm not dead or undesirable.  I just don't know what to do. I kept my figure and I used to be a sexual person, but maybe we're just terminally incompatible in this department.

I don't know, other people surviving on a desert island or something.

First post. I'm 45, wife is 42, we've been married 20 years this year, 3 kids ages 11, 6 and 2. So, I'm not going anywhere.

When we were first dating, she was a virgin; she lost her virginity to me, and when we were living together before we got married, the sex life was great. Spontaneous. She is and always was a very beautiful woman.

Then we got engaged, and she announced that we couldn't have sex again until we got married - a year in the future. That should have been my first inkling. There was very little cuddling, even, during that period - she worried one thing would lead to another.

My God, was I filled with resentment. Bottom line: Wedding day comes, we don't have sex - didn't have sex until about 2 weeks later. And that's really how it's been since then; awkward, very occasional. There have been times where we've done it several times a month; some very steamy occasions. There have also been periods where we've gone 6 months, or even longer, without it.

I did have an affair once, a two-month fling with a co-worker about 7 years ago. I simply couldn't avoid the temptation. I find it hard to do so today, but wouldn't want to screw over my kids.

For my wife, I think one of the biggest problems is she's tired, she's at home with the kids during the day (works part-time from home), her legs aren't shaved, she doesn't ""feel"" pretty/sexy and isn't in the mood when she doesn't feel right. When we go out - when she gets all dolled up - those are the times we wind up in bed. Be nice to have more of those times, but with 3 young kids and finances tight, well...

We've never talked about any of this. She is not someone to ""talk about our relationship."" I've just basically suffered in silence. Recently, though, I got in shape - after nearly 20 years of being overweight, I lost nearly 50 pounds, began to work out, and I'm in better physical condition than I've been since my early 20s. I feel good about myself; I feel like I'm missing a very important part of my life, and wondering when it gets any better. IF it gets any better.

She has all the qualities in a partner that I(M33) wanted.  

For 2 years, things were great.  She had a voracious appetite for sex that at times outstripped my own.  She was GGG(good giving and game) in bed and I was blissfully satisfied.

Then she ran into a year of various unlucky illnesses that compromised the pace of our sex life but the illnesses were temporary and I survived the year.  Things were beginning to turn around and I could see the light at the end of the tunnel.  She was feeling better and that meant that I was getting proper laid... things were looking up.

Then she was again very unlucky.  Someone rear-ended her in a terrible car accident that has given her a host of issues like major back problems, soft tissue damage and a ton of scar tissue that makes movement and an active sex life very difficult.

She works her ass off everyday to get better, heal and to recover from the accident.  She does yoga, physio, massage and anything else that she thinks will help her get back to a 100%.  Her work ethic is unimpeachable when it comes to her recovery.

Now to the dead bedroom part... We have sex about 3 times a month and it consists of maybe 15 minutes of her placating me(Same 2 positions and no oral).  It happens because she generally knows that I'm going mental with horniness and she honestly wants to make me happy.  I'd say about 10% of the time, she is actually into it and she shows up mentally to have proper sex.  I get her off, she gets me off and I have hope for our future.

Then the cycle continues and we have cursory sex the next nine times that it happens.  No oral, no adventure, no spark.  It's been like this for about six months and before that it was much worse.  I've been in DB for a long while now mostly lurking and occasionally offering advice to others in similar situations but I'm getting to the end of my rope.  

My sexual needs are making me very, very lonely/frustrated/depressed.  I can't survive with the way things are going indefinitely. 

She's the one for me and I can see us lasting together till we're old.  Literally all the aspects of our relationship work really well except the sex which is directly related to forces outside of her control.  It isn't an issue of her attitude or low libido.  She's got plenty of libido when she is healthy so I know that one day she'll recover enough from the accident to make our sex life satisfying again.

Thus my problem.  I am literally dying on the inside because I need sex.  I know very well that most of you know how I feel about being in a deadbedroom but I have no one to blame(except maybe the guy who caused the car accident).

I can't share how I really feel about our sex life(I have had 'the talk' with her a couple times) with her because she is doing everything she can and all that would accomplish at this point is to make her sadder about it than she already is and drive us further apart.

I don't want to leave her, I just don't want to feel like I have been for the last 2 years.  It's unsustainable for me to feel like I do.

We've talked previously about opening up the relationship but that was when she was healthy and I don't think she really wanted it to happen.  Now I know she'd not want it to open up due to the imbalance of that equation now.  She worries that she'd lose me to someone else.

I love her, I don't want to leave her but I need sex.  I need lots and lots of wonderful sex.  I need enthusiasm and variety and I need to feel attractive and needed.  I need a blowjob.  It's been years :(.  

What the hell am I supposed to do?  

Destroy my satisfying relationship to be single?(I don't want that)

Massage Parlour?(scares me, cost prohibitive, hate the idea of being that guy)

Pay for sex?(cost prohibitive, scared of STIs, no real sex connection)

Start an affair? (afraid of getting caught and breaking her heart) This seems like the only answer I can think of but I know this is the one if I was found out would hurt her the most.

Our lives are entwined, our families are very connected and losing her would devastate me.

I don't really have anyone to share my DB problems with except you guys/gals here.  I feel trapped and it's killing me.  What am I supposed to do?  Please help.

TL;DR: My girlfriend was in a horrible car accident that has affected our sex life in a very negative way for the last 2 years.  I'm not leaving her but am finding the lack of sex to be very difficult.

My DB situation is driving me crazy. I (23F) have been with my (26M) boyfriend for going on 5 years. We connect in every way BUT sexually. He has a nonexistent libido, always has, it’s not some recent development due to extra stress or because we’re out of the “honeymoon phase”. It’s been this way since before we got together, I didn’t know why until a few months into our relationship but the story goes a year or two before we met he was injured and had surgery in his groin area, a hernia repair. He says ever since after the surgery his libido is just gone. At the beginning of our relationship we did have sex, but I noticed right off the bat something was “off”. He never really initiated which was ok because I have an extremely high sex drive and had no problem “attacking” him and getting what I wanted. That worked for a while.  Eventually it did get worse and worse, we have had many fights about it.  I’ve tried to compromise with we don’t have to have sex, but pleasure me in other ways, but it doesn’t happen. He wont even touch me down there and I’m pretty sure he’s gone down on me less than 10 times in 4 years. The only way he has ever explained his extremely low sex drive to me is: “when the “average” man sees a girl walk by in a short skirt or something they might get a “tingle” or be like ooooh yeah, but I don’t, I don’t even notice”. 
 I love this man and the thought of not being with him is just as sickening as the thought of never having a decent sex life. I mean I’m 23, I feel like I am way too young to be in this situation. But I am so committed to him, I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m desperate. Is anyone else in a similar relationship where a partner has a low sex drive due to an injury or illness? How do you cope? Your thoughts/stories/advice is much appreciated.

To be clear, I only want responses from the high-libido partners in hyposexual (i.e., ""dead"" bedroom) relationships. It doesn't have to be a relationship with NO sex, just one with little enough to make the high-libido partner consider it a dead bedroom. 

1. How long since the last time you had sex with your DB partner?

2. How many times per year would you say that you have sex with your DB partner?

3. On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being the worst sex you've had and 10 being the best, what would you rate that most recent sexual encounter?

4.  On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all hopeful to 10 being very hopeful, how hopeful are you that your situation will improve?

5. Would you characterize the reduction of your sexual frequency as sudden or gradual? 

6. How seriously have you considered infidelity or an open relationship?  On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all and ten being extremely frequent consideration.

7.  Have you engaged in infidelity or an open relationship?  Yes or no will suffice.

8.  Have you tried counseling, whether separately or together?  Yes or no will suffice.

9.  On a scale from 1 to 10, how happy are you with your relationship aside from your DB problem?

10.  On a scale from 1 to 10, how happy do you think your spouse is with your relationship, aside from the DB problem?

I can count on one hand the number of times we have had sex, and all of that was within the first month or two of our relationship (five years ago).
I discovered early on that he had a porn/internet chatting/phone sex problem, and after many fights, promises, broken promises, and more fights, that has stopped AS FAR AS I AM AWARE.
I tried to initiate sex many times, only to be turned down. He was too tired, too busy, our schedules didn't mesh (he works nights). Finally, he told me that sex could wait til marriage. I tried asking why the sudden change in mentality, and was never given a straight answer. I wanted to respect if he was having some kind of religious epiphany, and so patiently waited over 2 years (we had a long engagement due to me finishing college before we got married). I ended up having surgery 3 days before my wedding, and was ""out of commission"" for 4 weeks after our wedding, but expected a normal sex life once I was healed...and it just never happened.
We are both overweight, and have normal body issues, but besides that, I feel like I am a reasonably attractive person, and he reassures me that he thinks I am beautiful.
I have discussed my concerns with him several times, and he seems to think the solution is to spend more time together, focus on ""us"", go on dates...but he seems to be in denial that there is anything unusual about our situation. I am incredibly frustrated, and feeling more lonely in my marriage than I ever was single. If this doesn't change, I might want a divorce. Advice?

I guess like most others, I just need a place to vent. Bit of back story: Me (23F, High libido partner) and him (26M, Low libido partner.) We've been dating about 2 years, great emotional relationship. Had frequent sex which we both agreed was amazing, but his sex drive started to taper off around the 6 months mark to about 2 - 4 times a month. Sometimes the sex was great, sometimes he didn't seem interested and rushed through it. We had a few marked discussions about it, but his only answer was that it wasn't my fault, he was stressed, or he didn't know why he felt that way. I try to initiate only once a week but get rejected half the time, feel like he's just giving in the other half.

Here's the long story:

A couple weeks ago I brought it up again, basically interrogating (as nicely and supportively as I could!) to figure out what the hell is going on. The gist is that he doesn't know why his libido is so low, but the very thought of having sex with me stressed him out. When I asked, *if he could change how he feels, would he?* he said he would. He just keeps saying he doesn't know what to do. At this point I am feeling like perhaps he has a low thyroid or low testosterone. The discussion was ended on me confirming I loved him and we'd work through this. For the past month we have not had any sex at all.  Now that I've stopped pressuring his efforts at romance/affection have sky rocketed. Compared to the tension in the relationship before, I'm really enjoying this.

BUT WE ARE STILL NOT HAVING SEX! In the last year he's gotten very fit in terms of working out, a very healthy balanced diet, getting good sleep, his work situation has improved. All extrinsic factors that low libido is blamed on are covered. I'm preparing myself to ask him to see a doctor/endocrinologist for some blood work and praying its as simple as taking supplementary testosterone. I have dreams of this getting fixed and us living happily every after but I'm young damnit, and the norm seems to be that it never gets better. He's more affectionate than ever but knowing someone doesn't want to have sex with you is a huge ego kill and I'm beginning to resent him. Its heartbreaking to think this is something he can't control and I might have to leave him when its no fault of his own; I'm really torn.

**TL;DR - Had the talk, didn't get any real answers. Currently not having sex and getting more romance/affection than ever, but I hate that its a trade off.  Love him like crazy but I'm feeling kind of gypped; we both deserve a satisfying sex life, he just doesn't want one. Preparing to ask him to look into low testosterone. Not sure if I should have hope for a solution or face the inevitable that things need to end.

I had started reading this sub a few weeks before, and it has really helped me express what I was feeling.  Previously all our discussions had mostly been fights about how I wasn't getting enough and accusing her on not loving me.  This time I was able to tell her more than just ""I want more sex"".  I told her how I was feeling and how hurt I was, and how the lack of an intimate connection was killing me.  I told her I was actually considering divorce at this point, because I couldn't keep living like this.  Well it finally clicked for her.  After a discussion about things we set a goal of twice a week.

It's been a few months and the goal has been mostly met.  We've had more sex in the last few months than we have at any point I can remember. Things are better between us.  I can tell she's putting in the effort to make sure we hit our goal each week.  Things are not perfectly where I want them.  For instance it's very rarely a spontaneous thing for us.  It's mostly scheduled the day beforehand.  She still struggles with the random shows of physical affection.  These are things to be worked on, and I'm happy with our progress so far.  At first I was skeptical about the sincerity of her efforts thinking she was just doing what she had to do for the marriage.  Now I feel her trying out of actual love and even possibly a tiny bit of desire. While she was getting a shower this morning I pulled out a pair of her sexy underwear; which we had bought last month while out shopping,  and put them on the bed.  When she came in the room and put them on and got dressed for work I was floored. I can't wait for tonight. The last time I tried that (many many moons ago) she was absolutely hostile about what 'I was expecting' of her.  Needless to say she's putting in very real, very visible effort for me, and I couldn't be happier.  I think she notices me acting differently towards her as well.  I'm not as short tempered,  I'm a better listener, and actually like to spend time being around her; instead of trying to get away and do anything not involving her.

After reading so many other stories on here I was extremely skeptical things could ever improve for anyone.  Obviously every situation is different and some relationships may not ever get better.  I want to thank all of you for the insights and commiseration.  It may be an anonymous online forum, but to know I wasn't alone was the best therapy I've ever had.

The last five have been very hard.  My wife (who I love deeply), has gone through 2 kids, thyroid cancer, thyroid surgery, type 1 diabetes, and several drug courses for depression (all prescribed and closely overseen by her therapist).


As you might have guessed, the bedroom is dead.   We've had sex once in the last five years.   It's been awful.  

Lately, she's had so many different courses of drugs (lithium, prozac, etc) that she's either screwed up from starting a new drug or screwed up from coming off a drug that gave her bad side effects.   She knows I'm going crazy, but she always has a headache, nausea, dizzy, etc.


So this is why I""m scared.  There's two women at work that really want to fool around with me.  

There's a gorgeous but not very smart girl that's about ten years younger than me (I'm 36). she's invited me to her apartment several times, once asking if I wanted to know if she wore underwear, and that I need to help her 'figure it out'.   I think she has a thing for men with money/stability, because she seems needy.   I'm not into her at all, but she is pretty.


More dangerously there's a woman at work that's been even more flirty with me.   She's my age and has a husband and kids.   I think of her as crazy, I don't like her personality and I avoid her.   She's somehow has been picking up on my low moods (even though I NEVER talk about my marriage to anyone but my wife).    Last week out of nowhere she came up behind me, wrapped her arms around me and started kissing my neck.  I jumped away and told her that I'm in no way interested.. but .. here's the bad part.. I let the kissing go on for about 10 full seconds (count to ten and image the situation).   

I don't think she believed my ""no way interested line"", and frankly I don't know if I believe it.   It felt so good, after so many years it felt like HEAVEN.   


I CAN NOT tell my wife.  I never lie, but this cannot get back to her.  She was engaged to a guy before me and he cheated on her; so she is VERY paranoid about me cheating (even though up until last week, I never even came close)

One of her problems is low self esteem, and the idea of me working next to women like this would devastate her.

I am 25 and he is 34. We dated for a year and a half previously. He had severe depression issues that ultimately lead to the end of the relationship. He was terrible in bed at that point too, and either wasn't interested or couldn't get an erection. I couldn't get him to try new things, and he wasn't good at taking care of me, so I pretty much refused to be intimate with him after that. We ended on really bad terms.

We split up for about a year. In that time I dated someone who was closer to my age. It wasn't the best relationship. The guy was kind of unstable, but the sex was phenomenal. I'm a very sexual person, and quite frankly I was pretty starved for some decent attention in the bedroom, so I think I stuck around pretty much for that reason. It ended when it seemed like he might become physically abusive.

I ran into my old boyfriend out of the blue one day. He's been through a lot of counseling and has attended support groups regularly for the past year. He's doing better in a lot of ways. We started dating again, and when we were first intimate again, honestly the sex was a lot better. I figured the old problems were part of him being suicidally depressed and wrote it off. 

But now things are going south again. He started having issues keeping an erection again, and he wants to do things the exact same way, every single time. Bad oral for about 30 seconds, flopping on top of me and squishing me, unenthusiastic humping without making a sound until he loses his hard-on, wants me to play with his limp dick for half an hour, or more, and keeps claiming that he's really close to having an orgasm when that's clearly not true. It ends when I tell him I've got a hand cramp and just stop doing it. He won't try new positions. 

After dealing with this a couple times I tried to talk to him about it. I gently said that I'd noticed the erectile issues and it was a problem. I didn't even get into the other things. He apparently didn't notice that he was having trouble keeping an erection? I'm not a man and I don't have a penis, but somehow I think it would be really hard to not notice something like that. He tried not to cry. He got really quiet for like half an hour, then said he was trying not to pop after 10 seconds and would lose his focus. Then we didn't have any sex at all for like a month. Neither one of us was interested.

So, yesterday we had a fantastic day together, and he wanted to spend the night. Same bad sex, but this time it lasted about 10 seconds and he went to sleep. I am so beyond frustrated with this. I left the room and pretended I wanted a shower but I was really just trying not to cry. I'm extremely frustrated and I don't know what to do, but I'm at the point of leaving. After 8 months of decent sex I can't see how I tolerated this to begin with and I really am not going to do it again. Please help.

I realise why this segment might be seen as good cover-all advice given the nature of this subreddit, but to off-handedly class porn consumption as an addiction seems to be going a little too far - surely a better approach would be discussing why one's partner is still interested in porn yet not interested in other sexual activities? Might it not be symptomatic of one's partner no longer finding one attractive for a variety of reasons? Maybe he/she is not being offered the sex that they desire? I realise that 'The Talk' should ideally address these issues but I also think that these are the sort of things that would be best addressed in context - ie, while talking about said porn consumption. Painting with such broad strokes seems detrimental in this case. 

**Anti-masturbation**

Firstly, the fact that the 'masturbation' question is strictly an option for the Male gender seems rather sexist, but moving on. 

The closing advice on giving up masturbation because it ""makes you depressed and makes your life miserable""? I'm sorry, based on what evidence, exactly? If a person can't get laid then the next best thing is surely going to be masturbation - why on earth would we advocate against its practice when addressing people who are *already* sex-deprived? 

**edit: thanks for the replies, I sort of thought I'd get flamed for this and it's good to see so many interesting viewpoints**

**second edit: regarding Anti-masturbation, my opinion relates to its inclusion as a catch-all stance; I'm sure there are cases where this advice is spot-on (a couple have popped up in this thread, so I'd be a fool to claim the position was nonexistent) but I also feel that it's potentially harmful advice to those for whom it is not applicable**

(we finally got a babysitter) I spent all day cooking food  for the kids and the babysitter (a friend of ours) and making up the spare room for him to sleep in etc. 
Then I spent quite a while getting dressed up, and trying to look pretty which I don't often get the chance to do. We went out (to a quiz night of all things) and although he was in a good mood with me, he spent the majority of the evening talking to our friend's wife, laughing and flirting and generally being more animated than I've just about EVER seen him be with anyone. (they are not having an affair btw) The other husbands were good naturedly laughing with each other and cracking jokes about ""darling, do you have headache tonight...etc"" and the like. To which the wives would all laugh too. 

I felt so left out because my man NEVER touches me. Or even looks at me, or makes a single comment about how I look in any way. I could tell that the other men there found me attractive, (not in a sleazy way) but I just can't figure out why he doesn't want me. It's got so bad that I don't even bother to try anymore. It's just too painful to feel that disinterest and apathy from him.

Later, when we got home I went to bed and he carried on drinking alone. Then I had to get up about an hour later for my son, and I caught him looking at porn on the computer (only pictures). I was so angry I let him have it...then I yelled at him again this morning. He blamed me for it all, saying that I kick him out of bed etc. I do kick him out of bed, but mainly because he snores when he is drunk and he is almost impossible to sleep next to at other times because he is so restless and noisy.  He is just NOT interested in me. I feel so insulted by him, and what makes it worse is that he hasn't even got the balls to tell me the truth to my face. I want to give him an ultimatum, but I don't know what that would be, or how to do it. I'm so angry right now I've just had enough...8 years of practically zero affection and zero sex. I feel like I live in solitary confinement. If I met someone today who showed me some affection there would be nothing to hold me back. That's how bad it is. 

How can I fix this? Is there any hope? I just can't see a way out of this that doesn't involve leaving him.

Let me be clear, my wife doesn't actually initiate.   But I can tell when she is trying a little.    Our bedroom isn't 100% dead as much as some others, but we have sex maybe once a month.  And it usually isn't very good.

Regardless of people's preferences, my wife and I both prefer her to be shaved (vaginal area and legs).    However, whether this be laziness or just trying to avoid sex, she will go weeks or sometimes months without doing so.    It makes her less likely to have her enjoy me touching her (as in pushing me away because she didn't shave).    Around the same time, she will not bother bathing for 3 or 4 days at a time on average.

Every once in a while, she'll make the effort to shave and take a bath before coming to bed.   This is initiating sex to her.   And while I have in the past taken her up by reading between the lines, it's become more of a slap in the face to me.    I just don't feel like her actually bathing and shaving should count as effort.

I do this every day as it is.   I shower at least once per day, and I shave my face and other bodily areas where I want hair reduction daily.   It's just part of maintenance to me.    If she wanted something on my body to be hairless, I would it in a second.  (I do shave around my penis daily and keep it tidy).  

In a committed relationship, you should make yourself as available for sex as is realistically possible.   If I jerk off too roughly or too often and don't have any desire for sex (or it would be painful) because of poor planning, that is unfair to my wife.  (assuming she wanted sex).  

Maybe I should be happy she makes any effort at all, but it seems as of late, I don't want to support bad behavior.

I'm reposting this in r/deadbedrooms because: Do you have any advice on what I can say to my husband to make him understand how important sex /when I actually want it/ is to our marriage?

I used to be depressed about an ex-boyfriend who never wanted sex, because I thought I was ugly. Took me three years to dump that guy. Nowadays, I understand that I'm fucking hot, and instead of depression I feel rage that I'm married to someone who will only have sex with me when I'm not horny.

Details follow.

----------

After a lifetime of atheism/agnosticism, I became Catholic after we married. I agree with many of the Church's teachings, and I found it was both easy and comforting to share this faith with him. But there are some issues where I can't agree, like the Catholic teachings on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. I have been ignoring/saving these issues for last, knowing they could be deal-breakers.

Over the past few years I've come to realize that I let go of all my close friends because I was afraid of offending them with my ""new beliefs"". I constantly censored myself to try to save my Catholic identity. I came to loathe myself for losing my exciting, magnetic personality. I have made some friends in the church, but I don't feel close to them, and I don't feel like I can share much with them.

My health deteriorated through the course of our marriage, and I found out this year that I have multiple sclerosis. It didn't take long to start questioning my faith. I've had a lot of time on my hands and I believe I've done a pretty extensive audit of my beliefs, my desires, and my personality.

I think that becoming Catholic really did help me stay afloat. Because of my illness, every day was a struggle, and the church and prayer routine kept me in place. I still say a rosary when I can't sleep or just need to calm my frantic brain. But I don't believe what the church teaches. I consider myself agnostic and morally good, but I can no longer see myself raising children in a church setting.

Over the years, our faith became such a central part of our marriage that I'm having trouble figuring out what's left now. I've been thinking that there are four main modes of connection/support: friendship, philosophy, sex, and stability. I think that two are great, but two are suffering. (Are there other modes that I am neglecting?)

Friendship: My husband is my best friend and my biggest supporter who helps me deal with all of my health and emotional issues.

Financial stability: We've both grown in many ways, and he has built a career to support us, with insurance that is paying for my medication (which would cost nearly half of my yearly retail income).

Philosophy: Here we diverge. As I've mentioned, religion and self-censorship are big issues.

Which brings me to my biggest problem - Sex: My sex drive was fairly low for the past couple of years because of my depression and ill health. Now that I understand MS, I've been taking much better care of myself and my sex drive is back. Maybe out of control. We have been using NFP to avoid pregnancy, and when my sex drive was already low, this was not a problem. But now I have a healthy raging desire to have sex with my husband, but the main point of NFP is that you DO NOT have sex when the woman is fertile, which is when I am most desirous. This is driving me batshit insane, because basically I'm only allowed to have sex with my husband when I'm only sort-of into it.

I find myself fantasizing about tons of the men and women who I help at my job. I get to the point where I feel like I want to proposition the nearest person and head out for a quickie. And I try to be calm, but it must show, because I'm starting to get a lot of winks and attention when men are in the store without their wives/girlfriends.

I share everything with my husband. We've begun to discuss my loss of faith and my frustrations with not using contraception, but I've kept the cheating fantasies to myself for a month or two, hoping they would subside. This week it has only gotten worse. A few days ago, I had to leave work early in tears, so I scheduled an appointment with an MS psychologist, and when my husband got home, I told him everything.

I also told him that these things seem consistent with bipolar disorder, and I have a history of leaving relationships this way. I get depressed, then I get out of depression and become hypersexual, and then I sort out my problems with the relationship and get the hell out of it. I'm hesitant to call it a problem though, because it has saved me several times: it provided the confidence that I needed to leave a few relationships that were genuinely not good. But now I'm confused and terrified, because my husband is a wonderful, good, and amazing person, and I NEVER had any doubt about our marriage until I got MS and lost my faith.

I'm worried that we won't last without religion. And I'm worried that if we do last, he'll always be scared that I'm going to cheat. I'm worried that I can't agree with him on how to raise kids if we decide to have them. I'm worried that I'll lose respect for him because I think of faith as a fairy tale with strong placebo effect.

Since I haven't stayed in touch with my old secular friends, I'd feel like a dick calling them up to say, ""Hey, guess what, I have MS and I'm not really Catholic, can you talk to me about my problems?"" So I'm here on reddit looking for perspectives. Catholic, secular, married, single, divorced, whatever. Thanks for anything you've got.

TL;DR Husband's religion only allows us to have sex when I'm NOT horny. Afraid my marriage may end, and not sure if this is right or wrong. (Going to a psychologist next week).

P.S. If I go on birth control, he likely won't EVER have sex with me. Catechism specifies that sex must be both unitive (you both want it; you don't use a third party to get pregnant) and procreative. Contraception negates the latter and thus makes sex forbidden.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1j51ly,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1j51ly/crosspost_from_rrelationships_how_do_i_make_my/,

I struggle with feeling particularly amorous toward him when I cannot get him to get off the computer long enough to spend any time with me. About 6 weeks ago I went to initiate sex because it had been a while. I asked him to rub not massage my back for a moment before we got started. My goal was to spark a bit of intimacy before diving in. At this point he gets very mad at me claiming he should not always have to pamper me into the mood, that we are becoming increasingly incompatible sexually, that his ideal sex partner would always be wet and ready to go, and that I was boring in the bedroom.

I want up my end of initiating sex but am finding it difficult now. Suggestions for the LL partner desperately trying to improve.

Advice?,21,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gfa1p/i20f_am_worried_that_no_sex_is_going_to_become/,"Hey, deadbedrooms. So, to get all the background out of the way. My[20F] boyfriend[22M] and I have been together for about 4 years. I had an ex for 2 years who cheated on me and he had an ex of 4 years who had cheated on him. We wound up meeting online, and I moved in about a year later. So we've been living together for roughly 3 years. For the majority of the first year we slowly got into sex. We mainly did oral/fingering/etc, but we did it often, a few times a week. Mid year, we got into having sex a couple times a week while still doing the other stuff on top of that. I was having worries because he would never cum when we had sex and we both sort of blamed it on his extreme porn viewing/fapping for the majority of his life. He vowed to cut down, and he did.

Pretty soon after vowing to cut down, his friend wound up moving in with us. We were living at his parents house at the time, so there was little privacy for him and I. Our sex life cut down to about once a week whenever we could time our fun while he was here and his friend was still at work. He discussed how he wished we could have sex more and sometimes he wished his friend wasnt there. 

After three months his friend moved out and we were alone again. I was pretty excited because I thought our sex life would pick up but it didn't. It continued to stay at about once a week, and sometimes we'd skip a week. I was confused and I talked with him about it and he told me that his ex had burnt him out on the sexual aspect of relationships(they were in a long distance relationship and just sexted a few times while they were together). I thought that didn't really make since because they never physically had sex but I let it go. 

We had a bit of a dryspell, lasting about 3 weeks and then afterwards we started having sex more often, about twice a week. And those times, for the majority, he was able to cum inside me. We were both excited about his progress and our sex life continued to be pretty good.

We wound up getting a place of our own- an apartment. And sex once again cut way down. We'd do it maybe 3 times a month. He'd always apologize and say that he was tired and stressed because he was the only one working. 

I recently got a part time job, and I asked him if he still felt stressed and he told me that he felt tons better. Yet our sex life has not improved at all. We attempted sex about a month ago and cut it short after a couple minutes because he went soft. It's been a month and we haven't had sex. I'll attempt to start it and he tells me he doesn't feel like it. I offer a blowjob and he tells me 'no'. Sometimes he'll tell me I should suck him off but then he just turns around and goes right back to whatever he's doing. He's told me before if I dress sexy he'd be more likely to want to have sex- I dressed in a short jean skirt that he likes and a tight, belly shirt for half the day- rubbed his crotch area and kissed him and he told me he didn't want to do anything.

I know a lot of the time, having a deadbedroom can mean that there's something wrong with the relationship and I've spoken to him about this not too long ago. I told him I get a lot of pent up sexual frustration when we dont do it for awhile, and on top of that it makes me feel ugly and unloved. He assured me that he loved me and I was beautiful but simply said he didn't ever really feel like having sex.

I know for a fact he's not cheating. And we've discussed his stress and he tells me he's not at all. He's still affectionate with me-hugs me, kisses me. He doesn't cuddle nearly as much as he used to and when I beg him to, we only do it for about 5 minutes before he hops back onto his computer. I just don't understand how we could go from where we began to where we are now. I don't understand why he wouldn't feel like having sex. He's always told me that he's had a low libido but I don't understand why it would be affecting him so much now. I'm at a bit of a breaking point because I really loved having sex and with us not having any it's hurting my self esteem. I guess I'm just looking for some advice as to why he could be acting this way and if there's anything I can do to maybe improve the situation. Thanks in advance.

I think I can consider myself very lucky, on average I get to have sex about once a month, sometimes as often as once every two weeks, so I do get to have some sex every now and then. Making it an enjoyable experience for her, that is another story, one that I'm not even close to figure out. She often goes into a blank stare or gets distracted by the smallest of things and from then on it's a hellish ride to very bad sex, one that ends up with me going to my side of the bed unilaterally, sometimes she says she wants to help me finish ""because it's not fair for me"" she says, I used to agree to that, the idea of her helping me finish, that was long ago, now I know how it goes, she'll barely touch me, leaving the ""H""Job to me, after just a few seconds she'll go back to her empty gaze to nowhere only to come out of it asking ""are you going to be done soon?"" that was when I used to end it for the night. Now I don't even bother to accept the offer, if it is presented, that is.

This past weekend saw another one of those vain attempts at something sexual in nature, she replied to one of my kisses in a soft way, that is how I know I have a shot at it, whenever her kisses aren't a mechanical response. I take it very slowly nowadays, so it took a while for me to star caressing her, kept at it for while before I started kissing her neck and then is when she let out a ""YUK!!""

She said I was drooling all over her, I've been very careful not to do that for five years now, she hates drool (as well as other bodily fluids) so I try my best to have the driest mouth I can, anyhow, she could be right so I give her some space and wait for the flames to come back. Eventually we get at it again but the kisses last less than a minute, she goes to her uncomfortable look, and I make the stupid move of asking what was wrong...

Her first answer was that I'm not very attractive, while I'm thinking ""fuck you I'm cute as hell"" she point out that I'm lacking muscles, so point taken, I make the compromise of lifting weights, and then is when she come up with:

-But is more than that, I can't be intimate because you worry me, you've got me thinking the whole time ""what are you going to do with your life?""

I work two jobs as a video editor, and even if I don't make much money, I still bust my ass working six days a week, so I'm honest with her:

-I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, but why don't you tell me what are you going to do with yours?

-I don't know, nobody knows what to do with their lives!!

-So you don't know, nobody knows, but you expect me to do?

Our bedroom has been dead for three. She is completely disinterested in sex and has told me on multiple occasions that even the thought of it is gross to her. I have an extremely high libido and my sexual tastes are a bit more rough than what I assume the norm is. This makes for a completely mismatched and lopsided sexual relationship. 
To top it all off, I have a small penis (5x4). I cannot help but place her complete aversion to sex on my inadequacy and it is killing me. 
I'm a very attentive lover and the years that I've spent with my small member have allowed me to become extremely skilled with my tongue and hands, she always comes first in the bedroom. I try my hardest to make sex a positive experience with her. In our early sexcapades we experimented with the more rough side of things and she absolutely hated that, so I oppress those thoughts during sex and try my hardest to make it as passionate and caring for her, but when it does happen I feel that the sex becomes sterile and bland. 
We've had a child four months ago, and although I love our child, it has been the final bullet in our sex life. Before our child came along, we were down to once a month sex. Since conception, we have had sex a grand total of four times. 
I feel so lonely and inadequate. I don't feel like a man, I feel like a little boy, scurrying around the house to find a private place to tug on his laughably small cock. 
I hate myself and I can feel the resentment for her turning into hate as well. 
It's so frustrating hearing of people who enjoy fulfilling sex lives. It also frustrating to see an attractive woman. I feel this deep, hollow pain inside of me whenever I make eye contact with a beautiful woman. Just a sharp sting of longing, as if her beauty's very existence is a slap in the face. What's more, even if I wasn't married and acted on my impulses, she would surely be left thoroughly unimpressed. 
I don't have a question or anything, I just needed to get this out of my system. There's no one I could ever talk to this about and I'm sick of keeping it all inside and letting it slowly erode away who I am. I had to let it out.

I (m30) dated this girl (f24) for a year and a half, she comes from a religious back ground and was uncomfortable ""going all the way"" which wasn't a big deal because she was still down with some pretty exciting stuff and I'm a patient guy.  We ended up breaking up and try being casual friends for about a year before getting back together, at her request.  I was of course hesitant but she swore it will be different and that she realizes how foolish she was and that no one matches up to me; she also mentions that the sexual limitations are part of her being foolish and if we get back together it will be on like the proverbial Donkey Kong.

Fast forward 7 months after agreeing to get back together and other than two isolated incidents which didn't go very far absolutely nothing has happened, not for my lack of trying.  She just seems totally uninterested and I usually end up feeling vaguely rapey and sick after trying to initiate anything, due largely to the way she just freezes up and says nothing.

We've had multiple conversations about it (all initiated by me) and she mostly just gets apologetic. In one instance she confessed that she can't tell if she's afraid or no longer attracted to me. I know that she was in to me the first time we dated, either that or she was really good at faking it; so I don't know what could have changed in that regard. This may seem trivial compared to the issues some people on this subreddit are facing but there was a time when I was fully intent upon marrying this woman and now I'm not sure what to do.  I don't want to just give up but I also don't want to keep chasing after a lie.

Any help that can be offered will be appreciated and I'll answer any questions I can.

I would be interested in any thoughts on where I am today and what I can do to improve.  Maybe I just can't see past the short term?

My wife (31F LL) and I (34M HL) have been married 7.5 years. Together we are proud parents of a new 6.5 month old. My wife is a great mother and my child is perfect. My wife is also breast feeding which I have heard has an impact on some women.

Since our child's birth we have had sex once (4 mo. ago).  It was terrible.  It felt forced and as if she was going through the motions.    Any other sexual advances (kissing, petting, etc) have seen no reciprocation since.

Prior to our child's birth we had an awesome 6mos of dating as I finished graduate school and her undergrad school.  Then we had 2 years of long distance and we have had 7.5 years of a normal 2+/- times a week sex life. 

We did have a challenge over the last 3-4 years with infertility and miscarriage.  I have a low sperm count and over those years our efforts to get pregnant were unsuccessful. We lost one child to miscarriage.  One day we just got lucky.

My infertility was very hard on me but I feel like I have come out of it better than ever. In general I feel as a person I am doing really well.  I am in the best shape of my life.  I recently won a state wide award for work. I am kind and hard working husband to my wife and father to our son.

I have tried to talk to her about our relationship but it always just ends in crying and both of us feeling worse.  My wife over our marriage has gained significant weight (60lbs) and I think she is self conscious over this issue having seen my dedication to exercise over the past 4 years.  To me her current weight isn't stopping me from sexing her up.  I am proud she is starting to at least try to do something to become more healthy after pregnancy.  I was also very proud of how she took care of our child during pregnancy.  At the end of any discussion I come away feeling like she does not take my hopes / desires seriously. 

The major questions I find myself asking:

1. Am I not attractive anymore? (I think I'm the most attractive I've ever been)

2. Maybe I'm just bad at sex? (This sexual relationship was great early on and I have had other good sexual relationships prior.  I would do anything to give her the best sexual experience I can.)

3. Is there something non sexual I am not doing for her?  (she compliments me on what a great dad I am and how I am such a good husband quite often?)

4. Is she broken?  I have suggested her seeing someone about weight loss and lack of libido.  I would come to if that would help to talk about it.

5. What can I do?  Every thing I try to do just makes my resentment higher and depression worse.

Bottom line it looks like I have a wonderful mother to my son but I want a lover and partner too.

I feel so stupid for even writing this.  If my wife read this I think she would be crushed but I have to vent this somewhere.

I am sorry if it has English, grammar and spelling mistakes. 

==============EDITED FOR UPDATE============== 

Finally had a good conversation on this topic last night.  The discussion finally felt normal again and I think I learned a lot more about what she/we are going through.  We had some limited sexy time that I think was good for both of us and it was great to hear what felt good and what didn't with this new body from her.  Are we 100% no way but the communication makes me feel like we will grow and be back better than ever.

One reason I am extremely optimistic about the future is that we are doing quite awesome (in my opinion) on raising this baby.

Looking back I think I/we were really prepared for the pregnancy BUT TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIFE.  No one ever told us some of these post baby secrets regarding body transition out of pregnancy, breast feeding, hormones, sex life etc.  The things we knew about we are handling awesomely (work, feeding, diapers, play time, walks, exercise, chores etc)

I think the main issue we had is we just weren't communicating on the things we weren't ready for. In all reality this is probably the first  challenge we haven't been able to immediately talk our way through.  I feel like I have my teammate back on my life trip.

I quit that job and moved to a new one with almost no stress.

A brief history: I met my husband when I was 18, he was 20.  We were both young and foolish.  Sex then was plentiful but tame. I was always the more adventurous of the the two of us; he was often shocked or unamused by my antics. After a rocky relationship and several breakups, we married when I was 24. On our honeymoon he complained, ""Do we really have to do it every day?"" Our sex life went downhill fom there. Somehow, while battling fertility, we managed to have three children, although the only way I could get him to have sex (to get pregnant) was to wake him up in his sleep. 

Years have passed.  Our children are older, although all still at home. My husband shows no interest in me as a female. We've been through therapy three times, with the last therapist gently asking us not to come back, as there wasn't really anything for us to talk about. ""When was the last time your husband was really into you?"" the therapist asked... and to my shame, I had to say never. 

Husband doesn't masturbate, doesn't watch porn.  He did get a ""massage"" from a tenant when I had just given birth to our 2nd baby, but didn't get very far.  He claims he IS attracted to me, that he's so lucky to be married to such a beautiful woman and yet... he hasn't kissed me in years. He won't honestly acknowledge that there's something gravely wrong.  He does suffer from depression and anxiety, for what it's worth. 

I don't like the person I'm becoming. I'm bitter and I feel trapped. He's a good father but I don't want to live this loveless life. It's much lonelier living with someone who ignores you than it would be to live alone, I'm sure of it.

A little background we've been dating/living together for the past 4 years. While our relationship started steamy it quickly got onto the regular groove of once every other week or so. I knew that he has a relatively LL compared to mine since he dated a friend before me. Our sexual preferences are different but still compatible, to keep it as PG as possible he doesn't last very long where most partners I've had in the past could go for at least a half hour. We're in a very committed long term relationship. I'm the main bread winner, with him still in school and working part time. We've talked about marriage and are waiting till he have a full time job as well, his decision, and have lived alone/with roommates in the past. 


I've been getting more and more frustrated with our lack of regular sex. When I do hit on him or try to even make out with him he pushes me away, apologizes, and says he's not in the mood. Sometimes he'll get in the mood about 10-15 minutes later, which either ends up in sex or I get upset because it feels like pity sex. He almost never initiates sex and doesn't enjoy just kissing me at an extended amount of time. He is very affectionate in other ways; gives me hugs all the time, likes to hold my hand, tells me he loves me, and kisses me on the forehead; but we almost never go on dates with just the two of us.


I have an autoimmune thyroid condition, which makes it very hard for me to lose weight and I've been overweight since we started dating. I'm working on slimming down, but it is a very slow process. I was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea and it's cause me a lot of anxiety. I feel that having a sleep mask on every night, is first something that most 27 year olds don't have to deal with, and is extremely unsexy. When I brought this up to him he said that I've already bagged someone and I don't need to be sexy. This has sent me on a complete downward spiral and I feel like I'll never be sexy to him.

We are best friends, even after 16 years together we get along great, I can honestly say that we have the best relationship I've ever even heard of.

The only downfall to our relationship and it's been like this since the beginning is sex. I have such a strong sex drive and she has none, it is not an exaggeration, she has absolutely no sex drive.

At the peak of our sexual relationship we probably had sex once a week, but now with our second child coming in August it has all but disappeared. We haven't had sex since February 2nd and although it doesn't sound long, it is a lifetime for someone with my sex drive.

She knows this is an issue because regardless of the situation we have always been good at communicating. She feels sorry that she can't match my drive but isn't willing to compromise.

Oh, I'm 26m, she's 25f.

We had The Talk and I laid it all down. What could we do, together, to make this work? It was a long discussion, a few tears were shed, but an accord was born that held true, even to this day.

She's pregnant again (hooray!) and we're expecting Baby 2 mid-December. Sex began to dwindle as morning sickness lengthened to ""all day nausea"". Worse than the last pregnancy, which has to suck. It's not all day every day, but it's often, and she's tired as hell trying to keep our two year old daughter entertained and fed, etc.

Anyway, I brought up sex in a way that might have been a little poorly phrased. She got a bit upset, but I managed to explain myself properly and she listened. I mean she REALLY listened. I felt heard and understood. ""I know how sex ties into your happiness,"" she told me. 

She asked that I ease off on the initiation for now, since fatigue and nausea do not a high libido make. It was scary to let go, but I did. ""You're my wife and I trust you,"" I told her.

The sex is less often than it was before, but that doesn't even matter. What matters is that I was heard and she promised that it wouldn't stop, it would just be a bit less for the time being. Completely reasonable. She's growing a human. 

I'm just thankful that I'm with someone who can really listen and have a conversation without playing the blame game or doing any of that ""injustice collection"" bullshit I see other couples do.

Here goes.. I am married to my husband for 1.5 years, after 3 years of dating (I'm 27 he's 43). We started being intimate soon after we started dating and since the beginning we had issues in the bedroom front. Basically he has erectile dysfunction, which apparently has caused him problems in the past as well but he's not had many relationships before we got together (mostly due to extreme shyness). Although he gets erections, they are always fairly soft and he usually loses them before penetration. The few times his erection stayed hard long enough for penetration, he came in seconds. 

Also, in terms of possible physical issues (sorry TMI) about 10 years ago  he was diagnosed with testicular cancer and had one testicle removed. He also has too much (or too loose?) foreskin. I have no idea if it relates to his erectile problems but it seems that if it's not manually pulled back he can lose his erection from one second to the next - somehow it can move up and cover the head very easily even if he has an erection. He also used to smoke both cigarettes and weed but has long quit both. 

Initially we tried often, tried to take the focus away from intercourse and on just being intimate, he went to the doctor a couple times and got some sprays, viagra and a flyer with info. Viagra worked to some extent, but he was not keen on it so we didn't pursue that further (although that was by far the best sex we had together). His initial theory was that it's due to shyness and lack of experience, which sounded plausible. He suggested that we should keep trying and that things will slowly improve. 

After four years though, things have not really improved. If anything, I have more or less lost the will to try even. At the moment, I have pretty much gone off sex: I know that I will have to initiate for anything to happen anyway, and given that I know how it will end, I just can't be bothered. He doesn't really try anymore either, but I guess I don't give the most encouraging signals at this point. I am convinced that it is not psychological or lack of experience issue but rather mostly physical. He can get erections and he can come but his erections are never particularly hard and he comes too fast. Other than that, our relationship is awesome but I don't want to have a marriage without sex. 

This has been pretty hard to deal with so far, leading to a lot of self-doubting and guilt for not trying more often, not giving him more time, etc etc. So should I keep trying? Should he go see a doctor again and get some tests? What do you think Reddit?

Just really I think need to get this off my chest, dont think there is really an answer, well I think i know the answer. 
I'm in my early 40s my wife is a couple of years younger than me. We met when we were both in our late tenns and married when I was 23 and she was 20. 

All pretty typical I think for here in that we were at it like bunnies at the beginning. She was never super adventurous but we would go at it pretty much anytime we could. For us both this was our first serious relationship, mine actually my first real girlfriend. So fast forward a few years till we had kids and for extremely valid reasons (tiredness, stress etc..) our DB issue started. I'd always been pretty HL and she I guess never really had been  - maybe ML?
I was understanding and we would make love when we could but it got rarer and rarer.
So fast forward to now and even though our kids are pretty grown up, life is fairly stress free, she works but only part time so isnt tired but our sex life is now zero.

We went from a couple of times a week to a couple a month and now, we had sex once last year and not all so far this year.  
Thing is she just isn't interested, she doesn't see sex as important anymore, she doesnt find me attractive sexually, shes told me as much.
If I ever try to initiate I get the laughing - ""stop being silly"" answer. so pretty much I don't bother, a guy can only take so many knockbacks.

So I expect some grief from this but I've spent a large part of the past 10 years having affairs, 2 pretty long term and meaningful and a sh*t load of one ""night"" stands from women i've met from various web sites and a few co workers. 

Im not looking for absolution just saying its been my way to deal with it. In most other aspects our relationship is fine, we don't argue much more than any other couple, we both love our kids, we share interests in movies and TV shows (mostly). She is pretty, slim but I just can't see her as a sexual person anymore.

I have thought so many times about leaving the marriage. It truly has been a miracle that none of this has come out or that I havent been caught over the years. I've gotten good at covering my tracks I guess.
I know I will never stop doing this, I just love sex too much to go my life without it.

So why don't I leave? I love my kids, I have a great house, I enjoy my standard of living. I know all that would change and I know that's selfish, as selfish as all the stuff I've done. Probably a shrink would say deep down I want to get caught so I get thrown out, taking away the decision making process.

I do know in the cold light of day that I'm treating my family like absolute crap by continuing like this. My kids are mid and late teens so in truth I think they would handle a breakup ok.

Although I know from her opinions on friends of hers that have divorced - she has told me ""if you ever leave me I will take you for every cent and poison the kids against you"" - so that's kinda sobering thought.
To address an earlier point other women constantly tell me how attractive I am and really I have never had a problem finding women, so it does irk when she constantly tells me how unattractive I am and that no one else would ever want me.
God, I dont know, just wish I was braver to just leave but it's so damn hard.

I posted a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18eqrc/just_a_rant_opinions_are_appreciated/c8e51ze) a few days ago about my experience with my nearly 3 year DB and how I broke up with my LL SO, and I had a few people ask to hear my story (about how I was able to meet someone new and *really* understand what I was missing.) So, here I am to give you a post about ""reality"" (thanks to u/AsAlwaysItDepends!) 

You can read my post history here, but basically I was the HL throughout my entire relationship. MY LL boyfriend had months where he would be committed to ""change"" and then months where he wouldn't want to touch me at all. It completely ruined me, and I was *certain* I'd never be able to meet anyone else. Even a month ago I was writing to people on this subreddit, telling them that I couldn't imagine how someone in  DB *marriage* felt because I couldn't even see the way out of a dating relationship! 

But I'm here to tell you that **there are happy endings**. Each and every one of you deserves a happy ending....but it may not be in the way you want it to. Of course, throughout my DB, I so desperately wanted a happy ending *with* my SO. I was seeking his approval and thought that until he was so ravenous and lustful for me like he used to be, my job wasn't done. But then, something clicked. Our relationship would never be the same. Sure, he could ""change"" and want the sex and intimacy again, but would I be able to accept his love? I didn't even know what it felt like to be normal anymore. I had forgotten what a healthy sex and intimate life was. I had forgotten what it felt like to be wanted, to have a mutually fulfilling sexual experience. But I wanted all of that so badly! I realized it couldn't be with my LL boyfriend. Our relationship could never be 100% again because I would never fully believe that he was attracted and desired me. I just knew it. I knew I would always second guess his motives, I knew that I would always talk myself down in front of him, fishing for a compliment. I could no longer continue to see him, because his presence reminded me of everything I hated about myself. He was not helping my life, he was making it worse. That's when I knew that it had to end.

I broke up with him and we both cried for hours. He swore he was going to change, the usual. And in fact, when we had nearly broken up 4 months earlier, he actually *had* been getting better. But I still new that even if *he* could recover, I couldn't. The cut had been too deep and I had felt so sorry for myself for too long. I needed to be free, even though I so desperately wanted him to want me. He said he loved me, that he was attracted to me, that I was the best thing that ever happened to him...but I still held my ground. He even came back to my house the next day with flowers, begging me for forgiveness and for another change. But I was already long gone in spirit. I needed a fresh start, I needed to be reminded that I *was* normal. There was something wrong with *him*, not me. Until I broke ties with him, I knew that dark period of my life would haunt me. 

I was so upset the next day, I could barely deal with the sadness and utter despair. But then, some of my close friends came over to calm me down, and they brought a few new people. One of those guys really caught my eye. He looked at me differently, his eyes seemed so soft and so understanding. Nothing like my ex. I knew that I had to move on, and I wouldn't move on until I had allowed myself to feel vulnerable and open to another man again. Yes, I dived into a new ""relationship"" right away. I can't call it a rebound, because I had been so disconnected from my ex for so long, it had felt like we had broken up *months* earlier. Now I'm not particularly religious, and I don't know what you would call it, but I call this new man an answer to my prayers. 

We began to talk and got to know each other. He would randomly compliment me, with a twinkle in his eyes and a playful nudge. It was the weirdest thing. Someone.....liked me? *Me?* I had felt like the most undesirable woman in the universe for nearly 3 years. This new guy had made me feel more normal in 2 days than I had in 2 years with my ex. 

They say ""you don't know what you've got until it's gone"", and I'd agree. I didn't know what I was missing until I found it again. The mutual sexual tension....the kiss....the chemistry. Feeling like I could go on [/r/sex](/r/sex) and *not* be bitter about it. Hell, I could try these things if I wanted...because I was with someone who wanted *ME.* Holy shit. I had forgotten that I was a woman who could tease a man. My new guy would tell me to stop teasing him, stop wearing tight clothes around him, etc. I would even just look up at him and he would laugh and tell me to stop looking at him in such a sexy way. Me....sexy?! Was this guy on drugs?! 

I told my new guy about my ex a few days later. I told him everything....because I knew that he would still like me. That's a valuable thing to have. With my ex, I had felt that I had to put on this persona and walk on eggshells around him. I didn't want to say anything, wear anything, or do anything that would turn him off even more. But with this guy....I felt the bond, the attraction, the chemistry. I could walk around with no makeup and he'd still want to fuck the shit out of me. I could put on a sweatshirt when I was cold and he'd still imagine me naked. I was a woman, a woman with power again. I felt like I could take over the world. 

We got more comfortable with each other, and the sexual talks started coming up. With my ex, I could never even mention the word sex without him cringing and trying to change the subject. But with this new guy, I found myself having....phone sex. What. I hadn't been with a guy who actually knew what he wanted in so long. He would tell me what he wanted to do to me, and I had never felt more comfortable with myself. This new guy made it okay for me to be a sexual being. He *wanted* me to. He actually wanted to hear about what I liked and disliked. He wasn't ""weirded out"" if I mentioned masturbation. I felt *normal*. It was (and is!) so exciting...to be able to buy lingerie and rock it again. Even the most plain sex with him is better than the most wild sex with my ex because *I know he wants to be there*. He's present, he's willing, he's eager. I know he's not having sex with me because he feels like he should. He's not kissing me because it's been a month and I'm in a bad mood. He's not complimenting me just so I won't leave him for someone else. He want me all on his own, and for genuine and pure reasons. 

This is possible for you. 2 weeks ago I didn't feel like it was possible for me. My mother says that every pot has a lid. Just find your own. It took me some time to realize that my ex wasn't a good match for me. Don't feel like you're worthless, like you can never find someone else. Someone will come along and remind you that you *are* beautiful, handsome, sexy, and *normal*. Ah, normalcy. Sweet, sweet normalcy.

2) It also reminds us that there is a risk of misogyny in here.  Sure, of the HL people present, we're 70% male (±15%), but we have to make this place safe for HL Women to hang around in.

1357142879.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,15twkc,I've just found this subreddit. Here's my story:,23,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/15twkc/ive_just_found_this_subreddit_heres_my_story/,"Hi all.


I've just found this subreddit and am so glad to find people in the same position as me. As a coping mechanism I really wanted to write down my thoughts and feelings and may even pluck up the courage to show my wife this message and any responses.


I married my wife nearly 5 years ago (we've been together over 10 years in total) at which point we were still having sex but at an alarmingly infrequent basis. When we were first together we were at it like rabbits but I'm now sat here having not had sex for somewhere between 2 and 3 years (I've forgotten the last time we had sex).


My wife is my best friend. I feel so lucky to have her in my life and every day I can't believe I am married to such a beautiful woman. Now at this point you probably have jumped to the conclusion that she's cheating on me. Obviously I have no proof however I have outright asked her and genuinely believe that she hasn't.

There are a number of factors that I believe are killing our sex life but I'm not sure if any one of them is responsible or all of them:

Kids: She got pregnant with her previous boyfriend. She was around 18 and had a termination. She has made her mind up that she doesn't want children and even though I probably do I'm willing to forgo the passing on of my genes if it meant I could have a life with her. I think the thought of getting pregnant is scaring her when we have sex and even with protection (pill + condom) I think it plays on her mind that none of these are foolproof.

Health: The last couple of times we had sex it was physically painful for her. She says it was due to thrush however I have two theories on this. I think she may have something wrong that she is too embarrassed to get seen, or that due to a lack of being in the mood, she wasn't as naturally lubricated as she should have been. Either way, she may not be wanting sex due to physical discomfort.

Appearance: When I met her, I was 16, 140lbs (5'9""), long hair, piercings, a bit of a rebel and unemployed. She was a goth in to the same kind of stuff and we were instantly attracted to each other. I'm now 30, 175 lbs, no piercings short hair and have a super-responsible job (which is supporting both of us, she has a job but the earnings are minimal). She left goth-kind too and dresses extremely nicely and has grown in to an extremely attractive 30 year old.

I also have to consider that she just doesn't love me any more. We are still best friends and our relationship is going well other than sex. I'm feeling like her gay best friend!

I've started seeing a personal trainer, i'm going to lose a few lbs and tone up and hopefully this will change things but I'm not sure.

I cant figure out if the problem is her, me or us.

I genuinely don't want this relationship to end, but if she truly doesn't love me then I would prefer her to be happy with someone else.

I have the typical story going on in my db, everything was awesome then slowly over time we settled into me wanting my wife and her having no interest.  When I first started to notice the issue I tried having talks that usually ended up in fights.  We even had a talk about sexual expectations early in the relationship.. of course she said exactly what I wanted to hear.  Lately I have been silent on the issue because of the holidays approaching, which is her favorite time of year.

However now that we are getting past the holidays I feel like I need to address the issue one more time.  I feel like I need to take a hard stance this time.. kind of an all or nothing situation.  The reason being is that we are on track to buy a house together in the next 6 months, and that was really the last reason we had for not starting a family.  

I am afraid to move forward with her knowing that I could be resigning myself to a sexless life.  I am planning on sitting down with her and telling her that if we are not at least trying to address the issue I will not move forward on the house and children.

I guess this leads me to my two questions.

* How can I tell if we are truly making progress and that is not just buckling down and giving me what I want in the short term so she can have what she wants in the long term?

* I need to find an outlet for my sexual tension, however I do not want to cheat on her.  Porn worked for a while but I find I am bored of it at this point.  I am thinking of moving into a grey area and finding some ladies to have sexual chats with, however I have no idea how to even go about starting that.  I know this is a contradiction of not wanting to cheat, however if I do not do something to take the edge off I feel like I might snap.  Me going off the handle starting a fight only serves to make this issue worse, at least that is the way I see it.

1353982556.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,13uktu,"I [21F] have been in a dead bedroom for nearly 2 years with my [22M] SO. We've talked through and tried everything-broke up, he swore he changed, now I'm not sure who's wrong here. I'm in desperate need of help and answers!",17,3,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/13uktu/i_21f_have_been_in_a_dead_bedroom_for_nearly_2/,"For about the first year of our relationship (we've been together 3 yrs) , my boyfriend was the typical horny 19 year old boy. We had sex whenever we could, in fact, he was into it way more than I was (I'd say I had an average-ish/high libido and he had a *very* high libido actually). Then, he told me that lately he hadn't been interested in having sex. 

My SO is not good at communication. He has a difficult time putting int owords exactly how he feels. Getting answers and his honest opinion are like pulling teeth. I had ""The Talk"" with him many times. From all of these talks, these almost breaks ups, these revelations, confessions, ""solutions"", ""goals"", etc, this is what I have heard from him:


Reason 1. At first he said it was because of my weight. This is an issue for me because I'm completely average and healthy weight-wise, and I haven't gained any weight. He told me he had a friend comment on my body (I have a huge ass, apparently this is a problem for some), and my SO, being the type to heavily rely on his friends' opinion, gradually started to adopt the same view toward my body. 

Reason 2. When he told me a few months later that it wasn't in fact my body that was the problem, it was the ""constant rejection"" he apparently used to face. He told me that I had denied him sex so often (I disagree, but, this is his viewpoint) that he had to sort of ""train"" himself to not expect or want sex in order to deal with the fact that I rejected him a lot. Also, we are semi-long distance for nearly the entire relationship, so he said that not being able to have sex with me very often because of the distance also made him gradually not interested.

Reason 3. Then, when he decided *that* wasn't the problem, he told me it was because he just had a lower libido naturally. I have a hard time with this. For a solid year of our relationship my boyfriend had zero troubles with a LL. In fact, he told me ""I used to look forward to every weekend when I would get the chance to have sex with you again. Now I actively avoid it"". He's not on *any* medication. He's been to the therapist. No depression. No drugs, doesn't drink. No ED whatsoever. Goes to the gym 5 times a week and eats healthy. Not insecure with his body or sexual performance at all. So I have a hard time believing his libido could change *so* drastically like that. And no, we've had no real issues outside of this in our relationship (so no triggering trauma or family, school, work issues, etc.)

Reason 4. After he decided that he did, in fact, have a normal libido, he told me that he still wouldn't mind having sex *in general*, it was just that sex *with me* sounded very unappealing. Not just ""meh"", but completely awful. He told me that while he didn't think I was unattractive, just *certain parts of my body* turned him off. So, I toned up even more (lost 10 pounds over the summer actually), and nothing changed-he didn't even notice the change in my body.

5. Then he changed his mind *again* and told me that he always felt pressure to do lots of foreplay and have sex for a long period of time that it became tiring and felt like a chore. I told him how sorry I was that he felt that way, etc.. I showed him some articles about female arousal, etc. But he said he would rather masturbate because it's easier. I understand that...but *never* wanting sexual intimacy with another person? So, I told him that it was my fault for not communicating sexually that he didn't need to spend a long time with foreplay and that he should only have sex until he felt like orgasming. (He told me that having sex when you really want to cum is very unpleasant and made him not want to have sex at all). 

5. About 5 months ago I reached a breaking point with of his drama. Throughout all of these number's I've listed, there's been *countless* discussions about his problems. I told him that a sex life is *our* problem to work on together, and that I'd be supportive of him through everything. But he could never make up his mind. He told me he honestly had *no idea* what triggered the sudden drop in libido. He kept flip-flopping on pinpointing the real reason why he had this disinterest in sex with me. 

And the thing is, my boyfriend is *very* touchy and intimate. He loved cuddling. He slaps my ass and grabs my boobs all the time. He tells me I'm beautiful and amazing every day. He tells me I'm sexy and that he's so lucky to have me....but yet....apparently not sexy enough for sex. Go figure. 

So, after all of that, I realized that he probably just didn't feel the same attraction that he used to, and that he had been trying and feeling pressure throughout the last 2 years to change, which actually made his problem worse. I told him that he shouldn't feel bad if he wasn't sexually attracted to me. But he did, oh, so bad. He was crying (which is *never* does) and talking about how awful he felt...long story short, we both decided to keep working on it. 

We had another falling out about 2 months ago, and after a few days of constant discussion and crying and fighting, I broke up with him. I told him that he shouldn't try to force something that's not there. I did it respectfully and kindly. He was not happy at all. He kept saying he ""knew he could make me happy"" over and over. It was very strange behavior. But, I chalked it up to a moment of fear over losing a 3 year LTR, and cut all contact. 

A week went by and he left me alone. The, he randomly calls me. He says he is on his way up to my place and that he's going to fight for me like he never has before. He tells me that since he's not a very emotional person, it takes a very jarring experience (like a permanent break up) for him to realize what I truly meant to him. I cave. After all, here's the boy who I still love, who hurt me, that I desperately want approval from. I want him to want me. But, I tried to be the stronger person and end a relationship that I thought was going no where. 

We went on dates, talked, and I told him how scared I was of being hurt again. About how every time we talked and he promised to change, that when he would reject me again, it would hurt even more. But I was so confused. We had been romantic and intimate all throughout our relationship. I didn't know what I did wrong to make him change like this. After a few weeks of talking, we decided to try dating again. 

And that's where I am now. He has done an excellent job as far as sheer number of sexual encounters we've had, but I still feel like something's missing. 

1. My SO gets sort of uncomfortable when talking about sex. He has *no* fantasies, no turn-ons (that aren't standard, like naked women, BJs, etc.) So, I can't exactly ""spice things up""…in fact, he says he enjoys the sex we have (which is about a vanilla as it gets).

2. I asked my SO if he wanted me to initiate more (I thought maybe he was the responsive desire type). He said that was a turn off actually. So, I thought maybe he was the more dominant type…nope, didn't seem into my submissive side.

3. I told him exactly what I wanted from him, how to do it, etc. So, he *sort of* does it for a few times, then stops again. 

4. Now, this is the main issue I'm having. **I still feel like when we're being intimate (whether that's PIV, kissing, groping, etc.) that he's not really into it. I feel like he's doing it because he's going through the motions and trying to be a better boyfriend. He swears that he loves me and the sex we're having…but it seems so lackluster when it used to be so passionate. I told him this, and he told me that he thinks that no matter what he does, I'll still continue to feel and insist that I am unwanted by him because of the past hurt and insecurity I face. I worry that this could be true.**

Is that the truth? We still only have sex 2-3 times a month. The problem with this is the fact that we can only see each other on the weekends. I wonder if we saw each other every day how often we would actually do it. Yes, technically nearly overtime we see each other  and we have the opportunity we have sex, but I can't help but feel like that's just because we haven't seen each other in 1-2 weeks so everything just naturally feels more exciting and new then. 

I guess I've typed out this novel because everything is so complicated. Now I don't know if I'm the one with the problem or if he is. Is he really changing? I don't know. He has done a similar thing in the past, but then eventually gone back to his old ways. So far it's different this time, but who knows. I'd love to believe that he's actually changed because I love him and our time we spend together. 

**TL;DR: Boyfriend flip-flops on reasons for LL. I try to be supportive and make personal changes to help. Doesn't work. I break up with him. After a few weeks we talk again and he acts like a changed man. Sex is more frequent, but low quality even after discussions about what needs to change. Now that he's making yet another attempt to change, I don't know if I'll always second-guess his motives for changing or if he actually just hasn't changed at all.**

Maybe it will be completely therapeutic to just share.  I've been married eight years, in my mid-30s, wife in early 30s.  We have not had sex in about 2 years now.  In fact, we have only had sex once in 3 years...if I remember correctly.  You actually do forget how long after awhile.

We have had issues in our marriage in the past so there are a ton of “trust issues”.  On her part, not mine.  We both love each other and otherwise our life together is normal.  But as many mention here the bitterness just stays at the surface.  It comes out with me snapping at her or being depressed and inside feeling it's her fault (which may not be the case most of the time).

We have had talks in the past.  She has severe body issues.  She is seeking help.  But I don't even know if she feels we have a problem.  We don't talk about it anymore as all talks led to her going down a list of all the things I do wrong.  I've never been good at arguing and when I do fight back she yells at me for being defensive.  After awhile it's not worth the fight.

I have thought of leaving, but I do love her and sadly if we would have a sex life I feel our relationship would be perfect for what I need.  Also, she has no financial ability to take care of herself.  At all.  So, either I would feel guilt for leaving her practically destitute or the state would just have me support her for a while (which I can't afford as I barely make it as is).

This is a throwaway due to the fact that I finally felt the need to post after lurking for so long.  Because this week she finally said something that just crushed me.  Suggesting that I would have to get her plastered to even think of us having sex.  She didn't say it with cruelty and it's hard to explain the context it was said in.  But it crushed me and kind of woke me up to my insane denial.  We will never have sex again.  If I stay with her...I will either have to cheat or go without for the rest of my days.

I am not sure if I am 100% to blame, what am I doing wrong? ",24,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1309qi/very_little_sex_for_the_past_5_years_due_to_my/,"I will try and make this as short as possible, otherwise I will be here all day. Thanks in advance to anybody who may read this.

Long story short, I come from an abusive family (my father hit my mother and I then walked out on us when I was 15, my mother is a raging alcoholic and my brother is now a mix of them.)

Due to the economical crisis we had to stay at my mom's house (consisting of myself, my boyfriend, brother and mother) because our jobs weren't secure at that time and we would get paid very late, my job for example always owed me 1 month of wage from how bad they were doing. Since we couldn't move out we stuck around until 2 months ago when we finally moved out. Living in a home like that is very...depressing to have sex, to top it off never having the chance of having some privacy.

The reason we haven't had much sex was because of how stressed I always was, scared of not getting paid, overloaded with work (which I ended up being hospitalized for, I was hospitalized from stress and after that I was fired). I have type 1 diabetes which is now well controlled, back then my diabetes wasn't well controlled due to the stress of course and lack of money to be able to see an endocrinologist.

I started feeling worse, turns out I was diagnosed with endometriosis. This explained the pain I suffered with sex. Every time I would get my period I would throw up, scream and cry and pass out from pain. An ambulance had to pick me up once (diabetes + endometriosis combined is not good) due to dehydration and me being delirious.

I was very ill for about 2 years thanks to endometriosis, the months I had to wait to see a specialist left me bedridden. I couldn't leave the house, I couldn't move as the pain would start all over again. I am better now though.

This is a whole bigger story combined of course but it is years and years of problems that will take ages to write down, but 3 weeks ago I tried taking my own life by giving myself an overdose of insulin. Lucky for my boyfriend when I get a hypoglycemia I act like an idiot and I more or less said what happened so he force fed me until I was stabilized. 


I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I am sure it is there. I think everything that has been happening all these years has caused me to be so worried and stressed that I have other priorities in my head than sex.


Another thing is that he begs me for it, it's every single day he talks about it, several times. He chases after me, he nags, he whines, he demands. He is a healthy young male so I understand it is normal (I want sex too!) but I tried telling him that it feels like harassment, that I have so many things on my mind at the moment that him begging me for it actually puts me off! I told him to PLEASE give me a few days of break considering the situation, as I am most certain if he stops chasing me and treating me as if I were some kind of fuck hole (excuse the language, but this is how I feel) I would be more inclined to do it.

I do think of sex, but it is always when I am away from him. May it be on my day off from work or while I am at work, I think about wanting to have sex with him and be intimate. But he just completely kills the mood by it being the only thing on his mind, it feels like a chore instead of something I would enjoy when he acts like this. I tell him to please back off a little bit, see if it works and I am certain I will initiate it because I won't have the constant worry in my mind about the sex issue. I need to not associate it with a chore or with a problem. He simply calls bullshit...

Another thing that is happening because he is frustrated and says he is depressed because of lack of sex, is that he shouts at me over the silliest things. For example the dog hurt herself and I just brought it to his attention and he shouted at me to stop bothering him over stupid shit.

When he shouts I can't help but get terrified as it reminds me of how things started to get bad with my father. I know it may not be the case but I can't help to get frightened and I get a bit panicked and remove myself from the situation. I have tried explaining it to him but he doesn't seem to understand that either. Obviously this is a mood killer for a few days as I have to try and get my mind out of the state of ""It is going to happen again, this is how it all started before, it is going to repeat"" because that is not the case. It's my mind playing tricks on me and this is the only way I know how to control it.

He says he wants to end the relationship due to lack of sex. I understand his frustration, but I don't believe it is entirely my fault?
The endometriosis set me back a lot, it kicked my ass. I can't control the illnesses I have, during those 2 years I felt like I was going to die due to so much pain. It has also sometimes happened when my blood sugar is high and I tell him I am not in good shape to have sex at the moment, he whines and complains about that too...I have to show him my meter to prove it is real. Sometimes stress itself makes it rise for no reason, I don't know.

Then the whole trying to end my life thing 3 weeks ago I just find his behaviour *at the moment* very inappropriate. I try to talk to him and have him understand as I do understand him, but he doesn't want to understand me.  I feel very lonely, I don't have any friends or family...he is all I have (apart from my sweet dog). So I don't have anybody else I can really talk to.

What am I doing wrong? How can I make him happier? Should I just do my best to disconnect and put out?

8 year relationship
Healthy sex drive in both partners


I'm not sure how or when our relationship started falling apart. At some point I guess we stopped touching - no cuddles on the couch. No snuggling in the morning. Smooch before work, before bed, that's it. Sex was 3-4 times a month, mostly OK but we both wanted more (but didn't know how to communicate to get it.) I'm not sure when, or if it was on purpose, but I stopped initiating sex.


Then I clued in - SO would only touch me on nights where he would later initiate sex. Something small - tickle one of my toes on the couch. This realization, combined with some other small relationship issues (more on that later), created a domino effect. My desire to have sex with him quickly disappeared. However, I went still went along with having sex, but it went down to once a month. I wasn't enjoying it, but did it for the relationship. 


Those little touches once a week or so made me dread going to bed.


I started to play the avoidance game. Stay up late when he has to get up early. Go to bed super early when he had to work nights.


Neither of us said anything about what was happening. 


I know it wasn't completely up to him to fix it, but I wasn't motivated to make a move at repairing things. I hated having sex with him because it's the only time he would touch me. He either was too blind to see the problem, too lazy to try and fix it, or maybe he just didn't care. 


The only thing he did to approach the subject was to say a very sad ""good night"" when it was clear that I was in bed but going to sleep, only sleep. 


That made me feel so guilty and so sad (because I was hurting him) but also angry that he wanted to have sex but wasn't man enough to bring it up or try to talk about it, or make any effort to fix things. His only actions were to stalk me around the house until I was going to bed. I was under more and more pressure to have sex with him. 


Then I took a new job where I had a huge learning curve. My brother got married and we had the stress of traveling halfway around the world (planning and paying for it all my responsibility) and then I had to pretend to my family that all was well with SO (they love him.) He seemed fine the whole time. We were still having sex once a month or so (once during our trip), but relationship stress for me was at an all time high. 


After we got back, we had sex one last time. This was in July.


I went to bed willing, started to initiate (because it had been awhile and I thought I should), but he didn't respond. I rolled over to sleep. A little later he spooned up behind me, I went along with his advances (since I was the one who initiated it) but then it was clear to me that he was just in it for himself. He pulled down my clothes, did what he had to, and that was it. No attempt at foreplay, nothing nice afterwards. 


I left to sleep on the couch. 


I felt horrible.


I started to stay away as much as possible - out with friends, at work, out shopping alone, whatever.


He still stalked me around the house at bedtime.


I couldn't take it anymore.


I emailed him and said we needed to talk. Said that I knew he wanted to have sex, but after the last time, I can't. Said that he had to know that the last time wasn't OK.


He replied, yes we need to talk. He wanted things to ""go back to the way they were."" I asked him what he meant and he just said that the way things were when we'd kiss when he /I got home from work and when we were having sex frequently. We agreed we needed to sit down.


Two weeks passed, no one made a move to talk. Finally, we went out for breakfast and did it out of the house. 


I aired all of my problems - he only wanted sex, not any other contact. That i was disappointed that he no longer had ambition in his career and planned on having the same job doing the same thing forever. That he has no hobbies, nothing to work on (Play guitar! Take a class! Join a sports team! Anything.) That he relies on me for all social activity and leisure time - goes out just with me and my friends, does not make plans or have friends independently from me despite my encouragement (and sometimes frustration.) 


Every major decision he's made, every big action he's taken, has been because of me. I don't know how I was too blind to see that in the 8 years we've been together.


That was in September. Since that talk, nothing has changed, except that he has stopped (for the most part) stalking me around bedtime. We haven't had sex since July. He hasn't brought it up. So I guess I'll just wait it out - try to convince myself that any effort from him to fix things is genuine and not just because he wants somewhere to put it.


I don't know what I'm looking for here on reddit, or what will happen from here. I just thought it would help me to share my experience, and to help others by presenting a different point of view.


It just sucks so much.

I could not tell if it was simply a feeling or if it really wasn't happening. So for the past three years I have been tracking every intimate event in my (M34) and her (F31) life. I'd bring it up every six months but there was always an explanation (we have a female room-mate, we live in different cities, we just did it, well there is no pressure to do it because we live together now).

Since November marks the third anniversary of this sad endeavour I had to bring it up at the two month mark. She responded at first by crying and asking me not to leave her. This was followed up by her observing that in the past three months we had been increasing the occurrence of intimacy so no big deal. However, increasing from three events in August to four events in September is not something to get excited about ... or is it? There are A LOT of hand jobs on record. That is for sure not something to get excited about.

Let's see if I can get it all out without dissolving into a bucket of tears.

We have been married for four months, dating for two years.  The last time we had sex was on our honeymoon in August.  Before that, our wedding night in June.  Before that, once a month *maybe*.  Now, nothing.

Everything else about our relationship is perfect and I could not ask for more.  We are on the same page about everything except the no sex issue.  The idea of having sex with anyone other that him is completely abhorrent to me, so cheating is not an option.

When we were dating things were fine, but things started to drop off drastically after the three month mark.  This January, he had a small stroke out of the blue and is on medications that he will have to take for the rest of his life.  (I feel so guilty about the fact that he made a recovery from his stroke when he easily could have died and I am complaining about no sex.  He's still alive, and I am so grateful.)  Then in March I had a heart attack.  We are both 30, so this was completely unexpected on both fronts.  

My doctor has told him that it's okay for me to have the sexytimes.  I just needed to spend a majority of my time resting and ended up quitting school and my job.  He used every excuse in the book, from ""I just want to wait until you feel better.""  Then it was ""I'm just so stressed with school and I'm really focused with what is going on there."" He keeps giving excuses until September when he finally tells me that he is still attracted to me, but nothing is happening in the trouser department.

I try to behave like a responsible and mature adult by always coming to him with any of my relationship concerns, laying out how I am interpreting the situation, how it makes me feel, what I think the issues are and wanting to know how we can address it.  I don't make passive aggressive posts to Facebook or trash talk him to his friends.  The first words out of his mouth whenever I tell him I am depressed, sad, not feeling well, or upset are always ""How can I help.""  ""What can I do.""  He gets upset with himself that I'm upset and lays out how he will take care of the situation, because ""You deserve to be happy and I will do everything I can.""  Except when it comes to the ""trouser problem""...nothing happens.  

He has promised for the past month to see a doctor but he won't even find the time to schedule the appointment.  It's always ""I'm busy with school.  There's a rehearsal tomorrow.  There's a concert coming up.""  To this I said ""You are a band director.  This is your life,  there will always be rehearsal, there will always be concerts.""  I know band directors are busy.  Before my health problems I was a musician myself, but I didn't think that he would put off our health issues so that rehearsals could take precedence.  

He never had problems managing time like this before the stroke.  Not only this, but he has problems staying on task at home, sitting on the internet and surfing cracked.com.  Sometimes he forgets having conversations although he is getting better.  For the first couple of months after the stroke I would sit down with him the night before and we would make a list of everything he had to do the following day.  He can still run a rehearsal efficiently and in fact, focusing on his job seems to be the only thing he really can do 100%...we only had sex once on our honeymoon, on the next to last day, and even then he wanted to cut our honeymoon short and go home a day early so that he could work on stand tunes for the new marching season.

But yes, he refuses to see a doctor, and now whenever I try to talk to him about it he gets annoyed.  He doesn't care.  And I'm surprised by how this has just completely crumbled my self confidence and my perception of myself.  I can't even look at my wedding portraits.  Every time I look in the mirror I only see an ugly person.  I've dyed my hair, maxed out my Victoria's Secret credit card, gotten brazillian waxes.  He still gives me kisses and hugs and tells me I'm beautiful.  I don't see it anymore.  I get honks from men who are stopped at the same intersection as me wanting to get my number, I get propositioned in the grocery store.  And I want no part of them.  I am so hurt that I can have men walking down the street hit on me and the only man I want to touch me can't be bothered.  I really do look in the mirror and not see anything that makes me beautiful.  I think I look fat in my wedding dress.  I can't look.  I've already had some issues coping with my heart attack and the fallout from that.  I was working on a second bachelor's while working and I've had to cut that back so I can continue to rest and recover, so I've gone from going full tilt to having days on end by myself at home with nothing to do. I found a free therapy group at the most liberal church in my conservative backwards state.  I've never been much of a churchy person and I know this isn't popular on Reddit but that helps me.  I've also joined a book club and picked up a new hobby, quilting, so I go to the ""sew ins"" at the quilt shop almost every day.  

I have tried my best to understand, to tell him that he isn't less of a man, that this is nothing to be embarrassed about and I won't laugh about it with his friends.  But month after month of no lovemaking is starting to take its toll on me.  I don't feel desired, beautiful, or wanted.  Whenever we did have sex, it was like pulling teeth.  He looked so awfully bored it almost killed off my sex drive completely right then and there.  It never happens, on the rare occasions when it does it's awful.  I've tried so hard to make up any deficiencies on my part.  I didn't think living with a husband would be like living with a roommate.  It looks like it doesn't even bother him.  He tells me I'm beautiful.  I don't believe him.  

This drastic change didn't really start until he went on meds for the stroke.  I have already decided that if this truly is a med issue I would rather have him alive and our relationship fine in every other way except a passionless marriage.  But we can't even determine that because he won't go to the doctor, and I am so tired of nagging him over this.  I've never been with a man who could go without sex with me for months on end.  We don't want kids anyway, and I'm wondering if, when my IUD has to be replaced in two years, just telling the gyno ""Don't bother replacing it.  There's no point.""  

I am a survivor of sexual assault and have had my share of abusive relationships.  I really, really wanted to know what it was like to have sex in a loving relationship.  We have lots of love.  We just don't have sex.

I've been lurking for a whole 12 hours, but in that time I've read every post for the last two months. I've got some more suggested reading to do, but wanted to introduce myself and tell a little of my story.

I'm in my late 30s. My wife and I have been married 10+ years. About 6-7 years ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and had a full hysterectomy/oophorectomy. At the time, things hadn't been good in the bedroom for at least a year or two, obviously because she was getting sick. The surgery went fine, no complications, but sex was painful for years afterward, when it even happened.

Meanwhile, we adopted a little girl. I had my doubts, but at the time we started the process, it seemed like the right thing to do. 

My wife can't have hormone replacement, but she tried progesterone a couple of years ago. It helped her feel better, but suppressed her sex drive even below where it was, and she dropped it. No change in her sex drive so far.

Anyway, I don't think we've had sex in the last year. I'm on the point of giving my wife a choice: open relationship or divorce (I haven't cheated, though I've thought about it). I don't want to disrupt our wonderful, amazing, adopted child's home, but don't know what to do. I don't think I can do this for more than another year. Even that seems impossible right now.

I've tried fighting about it, but gave that up a couple years ago because I could see it wasn't doing any good. We look great from the outside, but we have (I have) a huge problem. 

I honestly think an open relationship would be the best, because we have a great time together, as long as sex isn't a factor. But I don't think (she has said) that she's not the kind of person who can handle it. For me, if the tables were turned, I don't think it would be a problem, but for her it is.

I know I'm a dick for thinking about leaving for something that she has no control over. The situation is crap, there's no other way to say it. I've actually tried leaving once before, but I was in a terrible place at the time for other reasons and things got better for a bit.. and then they got worse than ever.

Perhaps I'm not even in the right place. Maybe there's another subreddit I should check out. If so, please let me know.

32M, wife is 31F, no kids, Married for 7 years.
Posting for the obvious reasons, slow down in everything, including sex.
I work full time and she stays at home and tries various ventures, including couponing, scrapbooking, crafts, craft shows, etc.
She also isn't quite motivated around the house to keep things clean, which drives me crazy, because after I'll come home from a grueling day at work, thinking that we'll have a nice dinner or something together, she's either out with friends couponing, done nothing all day but sit on the internet and read blogs, or just woke up a couple hours before I come home.

She's had trouble in the past with her sleep and even bothering to come to bed with me to even sleep next to me, which can't say makes for a very positive idea of having any kind of intimacy.

I'll try to kiss her and she'll peck me and go back to reading blogs, getting upset that I'm in the view of her screen.

I'll try to grab her or show that I'm interested and she'll get upset that I'm groping her, or just ignore it altogether.

We've had the talk a few times as well, but that's gone nowhere.

Lately, we've broken down into fighting much much more, including rumblings of divorce from either side.

I'm getting sick of dealing with this and I don't know if I want to continue.

We've been going out over 12 years. Sex was great and automatic for the first many years. We're both in our early 30s. We lost our virginity to each other after going out a few months, though both of us had plenty of experience with everything but penetrative sex in HS. 

She moved out unexpectedly for about a year a couple years ago, though she eventually moved back in. The move out was due to a number of things - it wasn't a breakup, we didn't see others, we ""dated"" each other during that time. We live together again.

About the time she moved out, our sex life was in decline. It was part of the reason she moved out; guilt, frustration, seeing that lack of sex was making me feel unwanted. It was a negative spiral that moving out actually helped with.

It turns out, though, that through the time apart she discovered it wasn't me that was the problem. The absence didn't make her sexually interested in me - in fact, she realized that nothing turns her on or gets her excited anymore. Her libido had just seemed to slip away.

Kisses are quick, sex is non existent for the last couple years. She is still, though, very loving toward me emotionally and verbally. It definitely frustrates her that she can't ""just do it"" like we used to. 

Our relationship is, for the most part, great - we love each other, get along very well as best friends, live together and share most of our time together. We've had ""The Talk"" a couple times, and she's clearly frustrated with her lack of sexual interest, but she just can't will it back into existence. She tried going off her birth control pills, but it didn't seem to help. The pressure of ""is something going to happen?"" and the stress of it all was probably enough to negate any libido that going off the pills may have returned. The stress of the whole situation in a way makes a DB perpetuate itself.

It's been a bit of a silver lining that we've gotten better at communicating through all this. Our talks have gotten more constructive and affirmed in communication our love for each other that has been lost physically. 

The reason I'm posting today, though, isn't to share a horror story. 

It's to share a little success and give a little bit of hope to those of you who (along with your partners) are willing to try and keep things going in a relationship full of love, but devoid of physicality. 

Last week, we laid in a bed mostly naked together. To someone not in a long term relationship with a DB, this may not seem like much of a deal. But for those of you in the same situation as us, you may understand how much of a step in the right direction it really is.

What happened wasn't Karezza, so to speak, rather something called ""sensate touch"" that a therapist friend recommended. [Link](http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sensate-focus-dictionary.htm)

Basically, it's where a couple that hasn't been intimate for a while takes small steps toward being comfortable with each others bodies. 

It starts with no sexual touching being allowed. Although it's just a beginning to a road back to (hopefully) sex, it was incredible just being naked in bed with her. The fact that she was willing to try was a great boost to my confidence and to her comfort sexually. It wasn't weird or clinical at all as her and I were both afraid it would be. It was intimate and comfortable, like it should be. I think we were both a little amazed by how well it went. 

I'll keep you all updated and hopefully share some good news. Worst case, we are comfortable cuddling in bed naked together forever. I hope that's not the end of it, but I could honestly live with that. It's a little weird to say as a guy, but the intimacy of it all is what I miss the most from sex. 

It's a long road ahead, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel! ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_y6hqu,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/y6hqu/possible_turnaround_in_a_2_year_db/,

My partner's constant rejection of me only served to worsen my already poor self-esteem. Recently, I realized that one of the main reasons I wanted sex so often was because I hate the idea of him looking at pornography; intellectually, I understand why it's a ""good thing,"" but I hate it. I realized I was wanting sex to keep him fulfilled so he would not go to porn. This always backfired, though, because he did not want sex very often but would masturbate semi-frequently. 

I've been trying to let go of the need to keep my partner's attention on me and trying to stop feeling threatened by pornography as well. Recently, I've been thinking hard about whether I was truly desiring sex or just wanting it because of low self-esteem (to keep him away from porn *and* because it helps me feel validated, which is also unhealthy). 

As a result, I've only had a few occasions where I truly desired it. We're nearly equal now -- actually, he's been wanting *more* sex than me. I actually turned him down a couple of times when I was tired; in the past, I was too scared that he would go masturbate to porn if I turned him down when *he* wanted it. I'm trying to teach myself to cope with those feelings and realize that he's not going to leave me because I don't look like the girl from the porn he just watched. 

His initial confusion and annoyance at being turned down actually made me feel proud. I felt like he needed to understand how it feels because it was literally the first time it had EVER happened to him. The more I consider that, the worse I feel. Am I an extremely terrible person for being a little happy because my partner is going through the same thing I had to go through for about 3 years? I love him wholeheartedly, and he's my best friend. Why would I feel this way about him?

**TL;DR Low-libido boyfriend now wants sex more than me because I've dealt with my excessive sexual drive. I like being on this end of it. Am I a bad girlfriend?**

To bring you up to speed, it's been a 12 year relationship that's had dead and live spots throughout the years. This past year has been almost completely dead.  
We've talked about it until we're blue in the face. He always promised that the lulls were temporary and he just had no sex drive. He was adament that he didn't want to split up and kept saying to just wait, sex is round the corner.  

Finally, about two weeks ago, he approached me for sex. Unfortunately, it was a heavy, crampy period day, so we ended up just pleasing him. It went well on his end and I was glad that maybe our sex life might return again.  

But no. Nothing since then. Today, I left to run an errand and forgot something in the house. When I came back, I saw him lifting up the slat in the blind to check if I was coming back.  
When I returned home, he'd left for work. He always leaves his computer on and guess what he'd been doing? Porn. 

Now, nothing against masturbation, but it's just not okay that he is using it not to supplement our relationship, but instead of it. This was just the last straw. I really don't want to make any effort anymore and obviously he doesn't, either. We had spent the entire morning together and I obviously would've had sex with him. 

I feel resigned and  sad, but not shocked.   

I think most of you know why and how it's hard to leave these relationships. The partner is your best friend....you still love them terribly... so none of this is easy.

I ( 35/m) am 10 years married to my wife (35/f).  We have a 1.5 year old son. 

I grew up a cafeteria Catholic in a pretty worldly/liberal household.  She grew up in a devout Catholic very conservative household.  We started dating in college and married 2.5 years later after we both graduated.  We did not have vaginal intercourse before marriage but engaged in other activities frequently and mutually enjoyable.  The about 6 months before we married Catholic guilt caught up with my wife and she asked if we could wait on any sexual activities for marriage and I agreed.  

Once married we tried to start things back up but she was having pain during intercourse (she blames my size which is larger than average but not to porn star proportions).  She also had a very severe bout with IBS and general anxiety during which time she went off birth control and we stopped having sexual contact for ~ 9 months.  Once we restarted our sexual relationship things went from 3x/ month for the first couple months down to about once every two months.  I would prefer 2-3x per week.  When I would try to discuss our sexual relationship she was insistent that we had it often enough and that we were the same as most couples.  

At some point she asked to eliminate oral sex from our repertoire.  She has a strong aversion to most smells and did not like her own or mine (I am clean and well groomed and from my small experience she has a similar scent level to most women).  In this past this was an activity that seemed mutually pleasurable and she would frequently have orgasms.  I didn’t feel like I had any choice in the matter and conceded.    

I have never felt that my need for a more frequent and enthusiastic sex life was valid until reading Sex Starved Marriage and related material on the internet.  I have asked my wife to read it and is making slow reading progress but our bedroom is still on life support.  I certainly appreciate hearing that we are not alone.

For most of our marriage I would fantasize about my wife, for the last three months my thoughts have turned to fantasizing about divorce.  Not the possibility of seeing other people, I do not want anyone but my wife, but the nuts and bolts of dividing assets, custody, moving to a new home, and so on.  I truly don’t want a divorce if only for my son’s sake.  I love my wife.  I find her intelligent, thoughtful in every other way, a good mother, and amazingly more attractive than when I first married her.  I want her to be happy too but I am becoming bitter from the DB.

To preempt the standard suggestions I am physically fit, successful in my career, take time to speak with my wife, propose going on dates (she is not as interested now that we have a son), do my share or more of the household chores, moved to live closer to her family with a longer commute for me, and make sure that she has time for herself and her friends.

Summary and things left out
We have been married 10 years with a 1.5 year old son.  Outwardly model nuclear family.  Internally suffering because of DB and me becoming bitter.
She has low libido, low self-esteem, general anxiety, Catholic guilt, and still has pain with intercourse.
I have higher libido, trouble communicating my needs as this took 10 years, pushover, don’t know how to make my wife happy/want me.
I would like 2-3x/week with some enthusiasm.  Current and for marjority of the last 9 years 1x/2 months where she would like it to end as quickly as possible.  She rarely initiates.  

Thank you for any suggestion.  As the partner with higher libido did you ever stop wanting your spouse?  Did you ever recover those feelings?

With him walking out of bedroom tonight, that's a full month. And by sex I mean sexual activity at all. I think the last time we had intercourse was probably February? But I'm good with other forms of playing :)

When we do have sex, it's fantastic. He is great in bed and both of us are very satisfied with our activities. 

We have a great relationship and he makes me so happy. We've had problems in other areas before and went to marriage counseling. That fixed everything but the frequency of sex. 

In 6.5 years of marriage (10.5 years together) we've gone to almost three months without sex a couple times. 3-6 weeks without activity is pretty normal. 

Normally for us to have sex, I have to ask ""do you want to play?"". Then I have a chance. 


It has been a busy month. He had a big business trip. School got out (I'm a teacher). I was out of town one weekend. We went camping one weekend. I had minor foot surgery last week.

He gets my signals, sometimes. The one he always gets is when I'm very into French kissing. It doesn't go anywhere. Yesterday he said ""we can play later"" and then when he put me to bed he didn't want to stay with me. (I go to bed earlier than him. He works from home and by choice works nights. He puts me to bed, usually laying down for a while, then leaves). 

For whatever reason, I've been testing him. I want him to want me. I want him to make that move from ""hmmm"" to actual action. This only hurts me. It only makes me cry. 

Tonight, he was all over me. Kissing my neck. Kissing me. I ask him to come to bed with me-pretty early-so I'm not tired. I cuddle up with him. He cuddles up with me. I put my hand in his shorts, near fun places. He says ""that's comfortable"". He offers to scratch my back-a known turn on for me. I make appropriately appreciative/encouraging sounds. I ask him to get some lotion. He's rubbing my back/legs/side/stomach. I am lightheartedly directing lotion and I ask for some on/around my breasts. He won't do it. I finally do it thinking he might like watching me touch myself like that  And he tucks me in and leaves the room. 

Fuck this upsets me so much!  I am so tired of initiating and being turned down.  I wish he would initiate at ALL! 

We've talked this through so many times. We both say we want sex more often. I'd like 3-4 times a week ideally but I'd be happy with 1-2. He says he'd like 1-2. Why doesn't this work?

Edit: things I've done in the last week. Monday he turned me down when I started loving on him and he wanted to leave. I flat out asked him if he wanted to cuddle with me or if he wanted me to masturbate after he left.  He chose to cuddle with me. Tuesday I sent him a picture of my breast. He came in the room, grabbed me and kissed my neck, said "" why are you sending me naughty things like that?"", and left. 

Edit 2: well, I intended to talk with him tonight. We started cuddling (we do a lot of our serious talking while cuddling)...and he promptly fell asleep. He'd only been up for 8 hours, so it's totally just a nap. But, no conversation. It was probably a mistake, but I sent him an email with some ground questions to let him know I want to talk.

he has been extremely loving and affectionate in every other way, but sex has never been a big part of our relationship, though i have tried and cried over the years. then a few years ago i became pregnant and the last time we had sex was the night we conceived.

after i gave birth he told me the reason he didn't want to have sex was because i had gained a lot of weight and he was no longer attracted to me. i had several conversations with him about this, letting him know that i felt his refusal to have sex was going to do irreparable damage to our relationship. his answer was ""well, i hope not, but there's always that possibility.""
i lost about 15 pounds, but that still didn't do anything to attract him. then, shamefully, i entered into an online relationship with a friend of a friend. we lived in different states, so having an actual physical relationship wasn't a danger, but we had several phone conversations, sexual emails, and exchanges of sexual videos and photos. 
for the first time in my life i felt sexually compatible with someone else. for the first time i felt beautiful and desired. i had the most powerful orgasms fantasizing about him. i had never been so turned on before, and i actually fell in love with this man. he told me he felt the same (he initiated every part of our relationship) but at the beginning of this year he cut me out of his life with no explanation. he hasn't returned my calls or emails and out of depression i lost another 15 pounds.

now my partner has gained interest in me again, but i am no longer in love with him and am no longer sexually interested in him. i am heartbroken over the loss of my online relationship but i accept this pain because i know i never should have entered into it in the first place.
i do still love my partner for who he is, and he is a wonderful father. but i have no interest in being intimate with him anymore.
i am still hurt from his rejection after our child was born. i am also worried that since i explored so many fantasies with my online relationship, i will not be satisfied in the least if i were to have sex with my partner again. in fact, i am not interested in sex with him if it is going to be how it used to be. 
my partner has no knowledge of my online relationship. he has always maintained that he is in love with me, and over the past couple months has made it clear he is attracted to me again.

My wife and I have been married for just over 6 months. We are both in our early 20's. We dated for 2+ years before deciding to get married. Due to religious background and some of our friends experiencing accident pregnancies, we just decided it was best for us to just wait until we got married to have sex. This was hard for us, especially near the end, but we decided it was best for us. 

Honeymoon was the usual clumsiness of being new to sex and trying different things, nothing freaky or weird. We “got better” at it right up until 3 weeks and that's when we started to have problems. It was like we just couldn't relate to each other sexually anymore. My wife still experiences pain associated with any type of intercourse and at the time (post 3 weeks) we were told my wife's body was still getting used to sex and that we should just keep having it, since it's a perfectly normal part of life. Well, it got worse still. At about 6 weeks post honeymoon we started to click again and had the best sex yet. At least twice, my wife let me know by interrupting our conversation that “sex was awesome last night”. The getting better phase lasted another month. I thought we were making some good progress since I was  starting to figure out what my wife liked. It was great seeing my wife satisfied, or at least enjoying sex.

After about 3 months, things took a nose dive and hasn't recovered. Right now, we can only have sex in the missionary position, before bed.  Oral sex both ways is off the table since it's “gross” or “disgusting”. Hell, I actually don't mind and used to enjoy going down on my wife, but now it's off limits. My hands are  covered in bacteria, so touching is kept to the absolute minimum. Sex itself is all about avoiding pain. A lack of pain is pretty rare. Even a slight movement inside can cause her to recoil. As soon as I'm finished, I'm pushed outside. I've tried to find out what my wife likes, what gets her going but it's as if there is a mental block to responding to any advance that I offer. I can see her get goosebumps and get aroused, but no matter how long I kiss and touch her in any place, she rarely responds by kissing me back. Not once have I made a negative comment about her body, but that's not hard because I find her extremely attractive and tell her so. I try not to pressure her for sex nowadays either, so I can make the idea of it not seem like an obligation. Doing all the things that lead to sex like back rubs, spooning, hand holding without pressuring her for sex seem to have no effect her comfort level. As far as I know, she wasn't sexually abused either. 

There are days when even a simple touch on the shoulder gets her pissed off. Those are particularly bad, since I'll be told later on she finds me repulsive and isn't attracted to me anymore. Ouch. I'm finding I just don't like to have sex anymore because I just feel empty, partly because of how it physically hurts her, the cold fish response during and just plain feeling like shit after. 

It only gets better from here, so any advice sure would help. ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_slcjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/slcjw/sex_life_hindenburg/,

I have been a willing and happy partner for him and he has not once in ten years made an effort to fulfill my needs in the bedroom. No orgasms with him for ten years, in spite of communicating my physical needs directly. He is entirely disinterested in my sexual needs, it seems.

After so much emotional pain, and a real effort to fix the problem because I love this man, I have given up. I'm going to pursue a relationship with a woman (partly because of my own need to express my bisexuality and partly because I can't bear the thought of subjecting myself to another selfish man).

I need to be appreciated. I need to be valued. I need to be treated as an equal in bed, as well as out.

1325083542.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,ntm0m,Joining the club. But a question to consider. ,16,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ntm0m/joining_the_club_but_a_question_to_consider/,"My story is the same as what seems like many on here. For those that wish to read it, I'll submit my wall of text below. For those that just want to see the question, skip all the way to the bold at the bold at the TL:DR

35 Male here, been married for almost 11 years, 2 great kids(6 and 1) and a wonderful wife(33) in almost all ways, but of course the one which is why I'm posting here.

I literally hit the relationship jackpot with this woman. We have known each other since gradeschool and have seen each other go through many different relationships. Even at one time, both of us were ""engaged"" to other people. In our late teens/ early 20s we became very close friends. Mostly because of her current boyfriend at the time became a friend of mine, and we all liked to hang out together. 

Fast forward a few years and both of us are unattached after parting ways with our significant other. We hang out constantly. Not dating but doing stuff without the commitment of saying this is my boy/girl friend. Many people around us say that we are dating, we just don't accept it. So we finally start.

This woman is the person that I wanted to be with, but just didn't know it. She thinks my geekness is cute and loves the random tangents I go on and we could talk for hours while we drove around about anything. I find many things about her endearing as well. Because I realize that I love her, I ask her to marry me. 

Now we both have our hangups. I over-estimate myself while she does the complete opposite. I'm confident that I can do anything and put myself into difficult situations. She doesn't have faith in herself and avoids uncomfortable situations at all cost. Opposites attract maybe? But recently the anxiety of our lack of intimacy has her taking the stance of: ""I don't want to talk about it"". This has been the standard answer about any type of sexual contact for years now and it has been getting progressively worse with each passing year. 

She had issues with physical contact that I was unaware, or choose not to be aware. She told me that it makes her anxious to touch others and she doesn't like to be touched. Even our kids being on her I can tell stresses her. I really didn't see how severe this was until recent years when her stress and anxiety level hit it's top point when she had a bout of post partum depression this past summer. I blame myself sometimes for sending that into over the edge not only because I was working a lot at the time, but also because to help solve our situation, someone suggested getting *The Sex-Starved Marriage.* She read about 30 pages of it, and it has sat under our bed on the same page for the last 7 months. 

I tried going to therapy for myself. She said it upset her because she was already seeing a therapist and to ask her to take on yet another appointment was just too much. After a session or two, I didn't go back because I could tell she was resenting me for suggesting therapy for us as a couple.

Almost done, just a bit more. She is a great wife in many ways as I have already stated. She loves her kids, loves me, does quite a bit that I think sometimes she doesn't feel appreciated for it.

*So here it comes* We don't touch each other anymore, at all. Our average sex about 5 times per year. This year we have had it maybe 3-4 times. If I put a hand on her in bed, she will forcefully move it away unless it is exactly where she wants it to be. We've had the conversation about intimacy many times before and this last time was nearly 7 months ago where she said: *""I will never be the person you want me to be. I'm just not good enough for you.""* 

In the past I've had rants about this that are a lot more derogatory than this post and to be honest more spiteful. But I need to look at this now with a clearer head. I've come to resent her for this. I've tried books. Therapy. Waiting her out. Going hardcore alpha. Doing much more around the house. Trying to reduce her stress. Giving her alone time as she said she wants. Being romantic. Being aloof. I don't know anymore. I don't want to spend my life feeling like I am forcing the person I'm with to put a hand on me. I don't mean sex per se. I mean someone who is comfortable just with touching me. I have begun to feel like I am some deviant because I yearn for *some kind* of physical contact. 

**To the Question: If you could tell/show your significant other anything about how you feel right now, what would it be** No fear of repercussion. No fear of being judged. Just an honest statement. Regardless of whether you are high drive or low drive.

For me: I've seen too many types of porn and too much of it trying to substitute that feeling that you once gave me. Nothing works anymore. The feeling is hollow when the deed is done. I feel awkward sleeping beside you anymore. I don't want to lose my kids, my house or my extended family, but I don't want to plow through my remaining years thinking that I'm married to someone who has no physical interest in me whatsoever. Why don't you care that this hurts? Why don't you want to do anything about it? I've tried for so many years and so many times to give you that ideal situation, but it doesn't matter. You'll find another reason why you can't or won't. 

TL:DR - Another guy(35), Married 10 years, 2 kids, no sex. The same story as every other post.

**status:** together for 4.5 yrs, DB for 3.5 years

**the good:**

* I genuinely admire her; she's kind, gentle, and bright.
* She is affectionate (hugs, hand-holding, kisses)
* Great relationship b/t our families
* We share some key interests and *can* have good fun together
* My job moved me overseas late last year; she's recently joined me in Asia and we're planning to travel together/explore the region
* My company is paying for rent and I have decent liquidity/opportunity to travel

**the bad:**

* She had several bouts with depression early-on in our relationship (due to family deaths,career/school disappointment, etc.), took antidepressants, and asked that we cool our sexual relationship [I agreed/supported/tried to be ""there""]
* It has never bounced back
* **I have had ""the talk"" with her 5 times** - I become ""all business"" about it; she ""shuts down and won't talk"", cries and nothing changes (""I don't know why I'm not interested in sex"")
* We have seen 2 different couples therapists (1st one was poor, 2nd was great, but the endgame hasn't taken - i.e. I don't have what I want out of the deal)
* I am very sexually frustrated and I can't wrap my brain around how she can be ""OK"" with the status of our relationship (I have asserted this many times in 1-on-1 and in therapy; answer: ""I don't know"" and tears; I feel bad for causing her pain)

**the ugly:**

* She quit her job and moved to be with me (other side of the world) and nothing has changed/it's not working/I'm unhappy in the relationship
* The full-on dependent arrangement has exacerbated the problem for me mentally; I'm paying the way, providing this opportunity to live abroad, integrating her with my new friends here, sparing no expense to make sure she's happy and give her ownership in the ways that I am able
* I tried to break-up several times over the last year, but was talked out of it by my father
* Per above, I become very sick (extremely) during my first stint abroad and wanted to ""shit or get off the pot"".  She wanted to build a life together; I agreed
* She and I are very different personalities:  She is passive, idealistic, and of a generally sunny disposition.  I am direct/extroverted, realistic (to a fault), and often polarizing.  
* I have been working out and am in shape/attractive, but instead of getting her libido rolling, it's drawn more 3rd party interest (not a problem for me to shrug off) and I have a full-on DB

She arrived here 1.5 months ago.  Her job ended 3 weeks ago.  I don't see it getting better and I'm very frustrated with her inability to talk about the DB. How do I ask her to get her old job back and move back to the states?

I'm worried that I'm in too deep here and the request is fairly unreasonable at this point.  I've clearly made a mistake and her financial dependence on me has only amplified my resentment.

She knows what I've wanted for a long time and has either purposefully or passively withheld it.  I've given her all that I have.  I'm done initiating conversations about this and she hasn't said one word about it since she joined me here.  It's eating me alive and I'm unhappy.

Basically he lost his erection, so we stoppped having sex, and when I tried to get him in the mood to start again, he ignored me.

I was sitting on the couch and his hand was resting on the base of my back as I was laying down. 
At that moment a million thoughts were racing in my mind, the way his hand felt, wondering if he was going to make a move, thinking if he doesn't when will be the next time we have sex, why did he lose his erection earlier ( it was the first time to happen), why is he rejecting me, why did he stop the channel on the one with girls in bikinis...does he prefer them to me, why am I not good enough, what's wrong with me?................ And then I just broke down, right there and then on the couch, I started to say it out loud,crying, '' What's wrong with me?'' '' Why do you ignore and reject me over and over again'' What's wrong with me?''....

Well, I don't think he knew what had happened because as it seemed to him, I was fine 2 minutes ago. He just hugged me, told me not to ''think like that, he loves me, he loves me body, there is nothing wrong with me''. After I calmed down, he told me that I talk too much about sex and it makes him crazy, like a child told not to do something, they will do the opposite. The more I tell him I need and want sex, the less he wants to do it. 

I understand what he said, Nobody likes a broken record, but I don't agree that it's fair. He could see how distraught I was, yet he chose to tell me that I need to wait until he's ready and willing, until it feels naturual, not try harder like I want him to.

This past week,I have tried to put up a front, I haven't said anything about sex, but it seems the less I do, the more I think about it, and the more I think about it I feel myself falling into this depressed state.
I wake up in the morning and my first emotion is paranoia, thinking he is masturbating before he goes to work, then the next emotion is dissapoinment because he probably will and we probably won't have sex. 

I don't really know what the point of this text was, I guess I'm just really starting to get depressed about the lack of sex, opposed to frustrated like I used to be, and I really don't like who I am turning into.

Also this isn't a problem with no longer feeling that she is attractive: I don't fantasize about other women, and I very rarely masterbate. I just don't feel that drive.

I honestly think my problem is born out of my occupation: I am a doctor in a field involving the female anatomy. I think that the fact that I have to look at sex organs and help others manage their sexual dysfunction has kinda killed my desire (I'm also in a high stress position and I'm sure it doesn't help). This work is my passion and I love it, but I think it is hurting my personal life. 

Does anyone have any advice on this or a similar situation? Any advice in general? It hurt's me to hurt her, but I don't want to be just phoning it in.

She is my best friend for the most part, and the rest of our lives are going pretty great, but the sex is killing it.

I've always had a higher libido than her. She was raised catholic, strict, and was never super into sex. Hates oral. Never gives blowjobs. Doesn't like me going down. No Anal. Pretty vanilla shit...

However, when we first dated, we would have sex at least 2-3 times a week. Over the course of 5 years, she's rejected me more and more. Always making up excuses. Too tired. Not enough time. Have to do something else instead. Always something. The only time we have sex is when she initiates because when I do, shes never in the mood (despite all my best efforts).

I've been romantic, affectionate, caring, supportive, and everything else under the sun. But she only wants to have sex with (1) shes been drinking or (2) when shes initiates, which is usually in part to #1.

Now I don't want to even initiate anymore as I feel if she even says yes, she just won't be into it, and will kill my sex drive. This has actually happened a few times. She just lays there like shes waiting for me to finish...Now I'm about 6 foot. Extremely fit. Well toned body, and consider myself handsome and confident..However, her demeanor in the bed just kills all that.

Is there a way to overcome this mental block? Or is there a way to get her to be more sexual? Am I a dick for leaving her based off of no sex? It's been almost 5 months and I've not gotten even a Blowjob or handjob..I feel I'm just her emotional security blanket instead of a real partner..

I did once talk to him about porn and he said he wanted sovereignty over his own body and didn't want to be told what to do with it. He said there's a difference between sex and masturbation and that he didn't see anything wrong with it. He was just pulling one off before he got a shower. Well now, I think there's more to it than he's telling me. 

I'm sitting at home waiting for him to get off of work so that we can talk, again. I honestly feel like if he can't tell me the honest truth, he can pack his bags and go (we are living n my house). Am I being too harsh? What can I say to him to get the truth?

We've been dating about 15 months now, and i love this girl to death. She's independent, beautiful, smart, funny.. but is not in touch with her sexuality at all.. She buys into societies idea that girls shouldn't be sexual.. and never really explored herself growing up..

My question is, being a 23 yr old male, i want to have sex almost every day... Is this too much? should i feel bad for wanting this from her? or should i just settle for weekly sex? (which, dont get me wrong, i realize isn't terrible!)
We have sex maybe twice a week.. sometimes only once, which i realize is not that bad.. based on other posts here, it could be far worse and i realize that.. but I am always the one to initiate it, and i want for once, for her to be the one to start it.. to act like she really wants it..

I would love a female perspective on this, preferably one who has experienced this low libido at some point in time.. but anything will help..

what should i do? do i stick around and try to work this out with her?

I have noticed for years now that my parents are not necessarily the most affectionate couple, they aren't really the poster couple in any way. Although they have been together for somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 years, they don't seem like they are really completely in love anymore. And it's affecting my siblings and myself. This really struck me last night, when I went over for dinner and to hang out for a bit, when by the time I had to leave, I was feeling depressed, sad, and hopeless. There is a definitive aura eminating from both my parents that affects everyone around them.

A couple months back, my dad and I were talking about some stuff, and for some reason he started to delve into his sex life with my mom, and how non-existant it has become. He had mentioned how he would occassionally look at porn and things, and how my mom didn't enjoy sex anymore. Now, I don't know the details, nor do I want to, but this needs to be fixed. Yesterday before I left, I dropped a note where my dad would find it later giving him the name of a few websites to check out, like yourbrainonporn.com and reuniting.info, so I'm hoping that helps the situation.

Part of why it affects me so much is because this has turned them so judgmental and irritable all the time, they aren't happy with each other, so they take it out on others. They don't try to, but I can see what they are doing. I'm not stupid. This is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with, but I know that there isn't anything I can personally do other than what I've already done.

Girlfriend is also in her thirties.  Never married.

Our relationship is almost two years old.  We are both responsible adults, cohabiting and reasonably successful.  

As the story goes, things started out rather peachy.  We were very attracted to each other and had sex frequently.  It wasn't the best sex I've had, but certainly not the worst.  From the beginning though, there were signs I should have seen which I should have known would lead, inexorably, here:

Though our bedroom is not yet dead, it's just about there.  Granted, it's not from any lack of effort on her part.  She tries to maintain our quota (twice per week), but I want no part of it.  

Sex, as she has admitted, has never been a priority for her.  In the past she was content to be used by her boyfriends for their own pleasure, not giving a shred of concern to her own.  As a consequence, she cannot obtain orgasm at anything less than 3000 rpm (toys) and derives virtually no pleasure from penetrative sex.

She does not enjoy oral sex (giving or receiving due to jaw pain[giving] and extreme ticklishness[receiving]).  

She has a very hard time getting wet, so we must use lube every time and if we fuck for longer than 15 minutes, she'll dry out.

She claims that I am the biggest she has had, so I cannot fuck her like I want to fuck her (hard) lest I severely injure her (we've had problems with bleeding in the past).  

She has also admitted that she is rarely horny.  Though she is the prime initiator, this is done primarily to fulfill her sense of duty in the relationship to please me by meeting what she thinks should be the pre-established quota (twice per week).  Initiation is achieved by asking ""Do you want to have sex?""  Sex never happens naturally and must be either scheduled beforehand or asked for, almost politely.

Though this situation might seem ideal when held against some of the other stories I've seen on this subreddit (""I've never had sex with my wife of 7 years"" What the actual fuck?) and maybe this would be better if posted in r/sex, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.

The characteristics I listed above, as you might imagine, place serious limitations on how much I can enjoy our sex life.  My past relationships were with sexually aggressive women who FOUGHT for their pleasure and goddammit, if you couldn't get them off, then you'd better lie down and prepare for the ride of your life because you're not going anywhere until you get that pussy off!

But, I digress.  I am under no false impressions about the variable nature of human sexuality.  Everyone has different needs.  We have talked at length about our differing ideals when it comes to the bedroom, but this has led to few changes.  What changes do take place after our talks quickly fall prey to complacency and things settle right back into place. 

That last part, however...is totally my fault.  I could have sex twice a week with my girlfriend, whom I love more than any woman I have ever been with.  She could be satisfied with me using her body for my own pleasure, disregarding her own and taking what is my right as man (not something I don't believe, btw though I have characterized it in that way to her when framing our situation during conversation).

But I cannot be content with this arrangement.  The greatest pleasure that I can derive for myself is the knowledge that I can please my partner.  That we can share in a union of bodies that will result in earth-shattering mutual satisfaction.  I cannot abide sex so stagnant in passion and physicality that a sweat won't even be broken, or I am unfamiliar with the taste between her legs.  

At this point, I find myself at a loss.  I would like to think that I have proper perspective on her needs and my own and that the difference between the two is just irreconcilable.  What little consolation I can offer myself is that she is willing to endure and to give her body to me when I want it in the limited manner in which she can handle it.  But that consolation is of little use when my satisfaction is achieved through her own.

Your thoughts are welcome.

She acknowledges the problem and wants to work towards change. She says she wants to go back to the days when we were having sex multiple times a week, and she knows she's inexperienced and wants to grow in this area. Yay.

One of her conditions though is that I have to initiate. Technically this isn't new - I've probably initiated 99% of our sex up until now. I noticed this pattern even when we were having sex 6 times a week. But when the DB started I got hit with a lot of rejections, and then sometimes the pity sex - she would only do it to placate me and sometimes during the act she's say something like ""isn't this enough already? Can you hurry up and finish?""

So now I have issues initiating with her. She never shows any sort of desire and I start to doubt myself - if I initiate will I get shot down again? Will she give me pity sex (which is the last thing I want)? Last weekend we had some time after the kids went to sleep, and she kept saying ""What are you going to do? Sleep?"" which I think was her roundabout way of saying ""Well, we could have sex..."" I waited for her to say something, anything that would indicate that she wanted to have sex but it never came and we didn't. Later that night as we were preparing to sleep she brought up that we haven't had sex in about 3-4 weeks and asked if I was okay with that. I was happy that she was being mindful of that and thanked her but let her know that I want her to desire it, not just put out to keep me happy.

Yesterday again we had some time but the issue didn't come up. I feel like if I'd initiated maybe we could have, but again I felt no desire from her and that killed any motivation I might have had. I don't even need her to desire me specifically, I just want to have sex with someone who wants to have sex, not someone who could go either way.

Usual DB story except for in two respects. 1) We had only really reached partial DB (long enough to identify with the ""duty sex"", ""initiating"" and ""self esteem"" references). But it was definitely headed there before I cut it short (&lt; 1x/wk and rising, yes I know many of you would kill for that, but then I didn't tell you to stay in yours). 

More relevantly, 2) SO was literally the most sexual person I have ever met/been with when it began (2x/day), at a  school some would call the US poster-child for HL-ness. And she was consistent and open about it with friends even before we met, so it clearly wasn't a bait-and-switch tactic. She had literally lost count of the number of ppl she'd been with in the year before me, but was guessing high 60s. As someone who thinks one of the world's biggest problems is that women are taught not to admit they like sex, this was obviously fine with me. It almost doesn't get any H-er L than this. Seems like a ""stay out of DB free"" card, no? 

NO IT ISN'T. To bring it back to my title question, I recognize it's a work in progress here, but how the hell do you avoid marrying into a DB?? What are the warning signs?? Cross off ""LL at beginning of relationship"" because it can happen with early HL's too. A marital DB is my biggest fear. I can't just ""cut it short"" if I marry. And the fact that I'd already decided I'd marry her if I were at that age (before the DB encroached) makes it even scarier.  As someone who grew up with divorced parents (I'm guessing started by a DB), I have always thought of marriage as something you only do when you're completely done being single and you've exhaustively appreciated every pro and con of staying that way, because marital mismatch is a friggin pandemic. If ever at all. I feel like unconsciously, all my romantic behavior works toward avoiding a marital DB and being my parents 2.0. But if even nymphoids like my ex lose steam in two years... ""if ever at all""...

**First stab at an answer to my own question**

You can't avoid marital DBs because there are no warning signs, and it is completely a roll of the dice. Marriage is the most final, wide-reaching, potentially devastating contract one ever enters, while idiotically being also the contract with the fewest terms spelled out and agreed upon. Combine these two and the only answer is to spell out that one, extra-special term before you marry. 

From what I've read on this forum, keeping reciprocated desire an unspoken agreement in marriage is not working. A spoken agreement on sex wouldn't be fun, but neither are the other thousand *very necessary*, spoken premarital agreements people make every day (how many kids, old mom has to move in, etc.). It wouldn't necessarily prevent DBs, but what it certainly would do is move LLs from probable to definite moral high ground and end some unnecessary self-hate and dithering. ""Am I to blame that we're not having regular sex? No, she agreed to it."" ""Am I being a dick for being pushy with him about it? No, he agreed to it."" ""Am I perverted or wrong to expect more? Absolutely not."" ""Should I feel guilty for wanting to break up/see other people? He compromised our relationship, so I shouldn't feel bad for just thinking about it."" Blame is preordained, desire and resentment both pre-validated, and grey area is seriously reduced. Your SO is willfully violating your relationship, which either crosses your red line or doesn't. When you're surprised SO hasn't been working on the LL since you last brought it up, flip out to your heart's content, because SO agreed to not let this happen. 

I'm not pushing an ""I vow to bang you exactly 3X+/wk"" approach. More something like ""Sex says 'I love you' in a way that's even more important than saying 'I love you', and I will be a depressed and useless partner no matter what else you do if we aren't having an average married amount of sex."" Or even more simply ""I don't want to get married ever because it means no sex—if we're going to marry you have to be the exception to that."" If you're already married, it might be a more difficult matter of getting the SO to make the unspoken agreement a spoken one. In fact I think this is why one of the few repeat successes reported on r/DB is the SO stumbling upon r/DB—this whole reddit is a confirmation that the unspoken agreement SO has ignored is in fact being spoken about loudly by plenty of people.

------
Sex is an explicit need, and the #1 reason cited for divorce is sexual incompatibility (a fact I've somehow never seen brought up on this reddit). TLDR—Maybe it's worth the awkwardness and effrontery to explicitly agree on having it. How do you think I can avoid a DB marriage?

My SO is an awesome guy, and I love him completely and maybe that's why it hurts as much as it does. For over a year I have felt neglected in the bedroom. He mentioned from the beginning that he was a xenophobic masterbater (meaning he only watched only white porn), and it didn't really bother me despite the fact that I am Asian. He casually mentioned that he has a preference for East European/Russian girls, which didn't bother me either since I have dated guys who had preference for Asians and it wasn't all that great either. I doubted these preferences mattered since he choose and loved me. But now I can't help but feel that my race is contributing to the DB. He's affectionate in every other way, we hold hands, and cuddle each night, but he gets extremely agitated when I initiate sex. I don't consider myself to have a HL, but I've become frustrated with the lack of sexual satisfaction. 

I tried everything. Wearing sexy outfits and lingerie, walking around naked in the house doing mundane things such as cooking, trying to spark our dead sex life with role play and other kinky things (never again, he had a very adverse reaction to this...), even just not doing anything or initiating anything to see if he'll eventually come around in his own time. I don't consider myself to be hideous, but my self esteem has plummeted. It's depressing when I walk around the house naked, and he doesn't even look at my body. When I try to initiate sex by touching/grinding him, and he lets out an exasperated sigh and says ""I'm too tired"" or ""not now"" - it's never the right time. It's even more depressing when I am end up masterbating next to him in bed because I haven't been satisfied for weeks, and he just ignores me and falls asleep. Thinking it might be my figure turning him off, I lost 10 lbs in a month (120 lb to 110 lb) and did body toning exercises to shape my butt, etc. It changed nothing. I don't know what else to do, and hurts to think maybe he's not physically attracted to me. 

I have started feeling uncomfortable being naked or scantly clad in front of him.. because now it feels like I am trying too hard to make him notice me sexually, and I get embarrassed. Only few weeks ago, I was in sexy underwear and feeling more confident than usual  I subtly made sexually arousing poses while my SO was in the bedroom, and as he looked at me disgusted and told me to move out of his way I became extremely self conscious of my body. I just wanted to cover it up and hide. He says it's not me and tells me that I am attractive but I can't seem to get him aroused. He does masterbate and has told me that he never had this experience with his previous gfs, which leaves me feeling like it IS me. I really don't know what to do. I don't want to leave my SO, but I am starting to hate my body, how I look, sometimes even my ethnicity.

Everything in our relationship is great outside of the bedroom.  We are both independent career driven people.  We are on the same page on so many things outside of the bedroom.  In the last year, sex has become a once every 1-2 months situation.  The longest stretch was 3 and half months, but granted I was on a 3 week business trip on the other side of the country, but when I got home it was another 3 weeks before any sexual intimacy.  I am always the one who initiates.  I am not an unattractive guy.  I get attention from other women from time to time.  I have never been able to bring it up, because honestly it has left me crippled in insecurity.  I feel guilty when I initiate sex no matter the result.   If she rejects me I feel unwanted.  When she does there is no emotion there and it is just going through the motions.  I try to spice things up, but she just wants me to finish. I started browsing this sub and reading similar stories.  I tried some things out.  I worked on myself.  She did not really notice.  Other women have noticed though.  I have turned down 2 women becuase I could never cheat on my SO. I do see though how easy it would be, and I would be lying if I said that I did not strongly think about it lying in bed at home after being rejected again and again.  

Anyways CUT TO Last night she was browsing my reddit app on my iPad checking out r/aww and some r/videos. I accidently left it open on this subreddit. She said ""What is this?"" I nervously looked over and it felt like I was caught watching porn or something. I shrugged it off and said that I was just reading stories. I helped her navigate to the subs she wanted to browse.

It's common for those of us affected by a dead bedroom to feel like we don't deserve these things. I've written about this before in more detail ([example](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19ijqg/305_am/c8oe8gg)).

I struggle with internalizing this. I struggle with it all the time, and I have for many years, long before my dead bedroom, long before my marriage even. I almost never feel like I deserve the intimacy I get or that I crave. In case that wasn't clear: my dead bedroom was not the sole cause of this - I've never been the most confident guy when it comes to sex and sexuality - but it definitely exacerbated these feelings.

I discussed this in therapy some a while ago. It was something I never got very far with. I was asked how I feel when I'm having sexual contact. My response was ""lucky"". I've always said that, and said that to my wife many times. What a sweet thing to say, right? That I'm lucky to be together with her sexually. However, ""lucky"" was also this subtle insult aimed at myself. That is to say, I didn't deserve it, but *luckily*, I somehow got it anyway. I could instead say that it makes me feel special, or loved, or cherished, or but those words don't come to mind quite as automatically as ""lucky"" does.

I believe these feelings of non-deserving were the reason I did not really consider leaving my marriage, even though I had the ideal situation to do so (mid 20s at the time, no kids, no shared property). I had lots of thoughts like:

* Some people have an exciting sexual life, but I am clearly not one of those people
* I should work on trying to help other people and less about myself
* This is just the way life is meant to be for me
* I am happier being together with my wife, even in this situation, than I would be without her

And so I kept myself in a situation that could very well have perpetuated itself for so much longer than it did. I don't know what to think of these feelings of inadequacy. They have caused me a lot of grief, but also seem to have contributed, in some strange way, to keeping my marriage going during our most difficult times. I'm very conflicted about this, but I ultimately think they are unhealthy for me, even if they serendipitous-ly(?) helped my wife and I get to where we are now in our marriage (along with a lot of effort, support, therapy, improved communication, and patience).

The main way I know to try and make progress with reversing these kind of negative though patterns is to work on recognizing them consciously when they do occur, and tell yourself that they don't actually make sense for the situation you're in. This seems stupid to me in the short-term, but it has helped me some with other negative thought patterns in the past over long periods of time, and it has helped my wife remove some of her negative associations of sexual encounters, whether anxiety or shame.

Recently, during a sexual encounter, I spontaneously had the thought: ""Wow, I don't deserve to feel *this* good"". Again, an insult wrapped in a tidy little mask of a compliment. How sneaky I am! Luckily, this time I noticed it almost right away, and somehow that was enough to let go for a bit and enjoy what was happening in the present moment. I hope to be able to do that more in the future.

1362541893.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,19r667,[Update]: Are you kidding me? That's all I have to do??,23,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19r667/update_are_you_kidding_me_thats_all_i_have_to_do/,"This is an update to [this wall of text](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/19lxdz/f_late_30s_just_want_to_remember_what_it_was_like/). So. Since I am terrible with words and feelings and have a tendency to blurt out the worst possible thing, that is exactly what I did soon after I made that post, when my SO asked what had been bothering me: ""I could walk in naked and you wouldn't care!"" The look on his face was one of total surprise and he said something along the lines of ""Is THAT what this was about? I thought you were stressed out because of work!"" For some reason, the conversation didn't get much further than that, I don't know, maybe the Ativan had kicked in. We were on the couch and I ended up falling asleep with my head in his lap.

I wasn't going to let it drop this time, though, so I wrote an email, tried to keep it as brief as possible (he has ADHD) and tried not to barf from nervousness at work. When I got home, he didn't say anything about the email first, but then finally let the other shoe drop, saying he had read the email.

Basically, what he said was:

 * Yes, **I am being too subtle** (with the lingerie and/or cuddling).
 * If I want to fuck, **just touch his cock**

... lol :|

His explanation was that he has never been able to pick up on subtle hints or body language, in fact when ladies have been subtle in the past, it just frustrates him, having the opposite effect. I guess when I think back, he has usually been on the passive side. I was the one who made the first move on him and it was pretty direct (not much in the way of flirting, just sat on his lap). 

I asked him **when** was a good time to reach for his cock, what with his incredibly crappy work schedule (he goes to bed around 8 PM and wakes up at 3:30 AM :( ). He said that there's always before he went to bed or just waiting for the weekend.

I also asked him jokingly why he didn't grope my ass anymore, and his answer was ""I don't know"" (???? Guess I'll get to the bottom of that answer but one thing at a time!). He then asked if he could see my new underwear :3

We didn't get further than some cuddling and groping last night (it was bedtime for him) buuut I decided to put this ""just touch the cock"" thing to the test tonight. He went to go read in bed before he had to go to sleep. I came in a few minutes later, got on the bed, gave him a kiss on the lips and then put my hand on his cock. Well, sure enough, it woke up. So then I decided to go to town on his cock with a blowjob, something I had been thinking about all evening.

So. There's still some other things we need to work out, but it's clear to me that if I want sex to happen, I'm going to have to be the agressor. He doesn't have to take any risks. In some ways I am fine with this, because I hate flirting and coy bullshit, and I am terrible at it. We'll see how this progresses.

We have a large age difference of 25 years, which may or may not be related to the problem. I am HL, he is LL. Sex occurs about once a month, and when it does happen, it's extremely uninspired on his part. He gives little to no effort, and essentially lies down motionless, allowing me to do whatever. Once he climaxes (which usually occurs as I try my best to please both of us equally), it's over. Regardless of whether or not I've been satisfied, he is done. If I ever try to introduce something kinkier to spice up the experience, he is very apathetic towards it, which makes me lose interest. 

I only recently had a discussion with him regarding the matter. His conclusion on the situation was, ""well you've got to meet me halfway"", which floored me. He continued, ""You always want to have sex after I get off work, which is when I feel the most exhausted."" I attempted to explain that he starts his day at 5:30AM, and it's been made clear that waking him up shortly before that to have sex isn't an option. He'd rather sleep. So that leaves us with strictly the weekends, but he uses the same excuses. ""I would rather just relax and watch TV on the weekends"", ""I need to take a nap so I'm rested for the work week"", etc. I feel as if he treats it like a chore, and that he has to go out of his way to do it. 

One issue that I suspect is part of the problem is his sleep apnea. He never knew that he had it, but I started noticing it at night. For the past year, I've been trying to convince him to talk to a doctor about it and discuss having a sleep study. But he says that he doesn't like the idea of a mask (CPAP), and that the real problem is that he needs to lose weight, which he'd rather do. Problem is, he's not losing the weight, so he needs to do the CPAP for now. He truly seems constantly exhausted and tired, and always has, so I believe that treating this really might help the situation. But he won't make an attempt at dealing with it, even if it's to his benefit. 

What I don't want to believe is that the problem runs deeper, and that he just no longer has an attraction towards me. It's a very real possibility that even with the sleep apnea treated, and with him having more energy throughout the day, he still won't be interested in sex. Unfortunately, I'm starting to believe that's the case. If the thought of us having a healthier sex life appealed to him, I feel as if he'd put effort into that goal. Instead, I just get every excuse in the book. 

A little more about me. I am 21, and I'm a male (I'm stating this as most people probably would have assumed otherwise at this point). This is my first relationship, and I've had no experience in when is a good time to keep working towards a solution with your SO, and when is a good time to leave. I love him immensely, and the thought of him being saddened by a break up kills me. But our lack of sex manifests itself in all aspects of our relationship, and I very seldom feel any sort of affection in any form from him. It also makes me feel unattractive and somewhat worthless, even though every guy that approaches me when I'm out at the bars would disagree. So yes, I've already gone halfway, but he doesn't seem to be there. ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_17uyzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/17uyzr/meet_me_halfway/,
1359584771.0,15,self.DeadBedrooms,17l7pk,On Talking to Men,32,17,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/17l7pk/on_talking_to_men/,"Men are dumb. Actually this isn’t true, but it got your attention and sometimes it works as a mental paradigm. It should probably be something more like: ‘men can be dumb about certain things, especially if we think you’re going to be upset’. For the sake of being concise, let’s just assume that men are dumb.

Remember the last time he said he wanted to have sex with you, and then stayed up late playing on his laptop to avoid coming to bed at the same time? That hurts, it feels like rejection. This is a perfect example of men being kinda dumb. When sex comes up in conversation, and he’s rationally aware that you want more (better, harder) of it, he will agree to pretty much anything. In his mind, later can be dealt with later. Your husband will promise you sex to make you happy. And it works too, at least for a while: you get that little bubble rush of excited anticipation inside you, and you show it. He sees this and realizes he’s made the right choice. When your husband is presented with a choice of two outcomes, one in which you are happy right now, and one in which you are unhappy right now, he will aim for making you happy *right now*. This is a perfectly rational decision. He is not hatching a master plan to ultimately frustrate you for eternity, he is just thinking ‘how can I make her happy now’. He could also have communicated what was actually standing in the way of his attraction, but that would probably end with an unhappy woman, especially if you are part of the reason. He takes the rationally easy route to avoid making you emotional. The key point: he is promising sex later to make you happy, so don’t hate him for this. He’s just being a bit dumb.

So that explains why he agrees in the first place, but why doesn’t he deliver when the time comes? Well, quite honestly, **he doesn’t want to**. That might sting a little to hear, but it may not even have much to do with you. This is when his own lack of sexual desire comes face to face with his need to keep you happy.  We could make a list of reasons why a man might have a reduced libido, but it will be long, diverse, and not really relevant to this topic. (We’ll tackle it later.)

Whatever his personal issues may be, he will have to deal with them on his own terms. What you can do is make him aware of how it’s affecting you and your relationship. What you can do is change the way you communicate with your man. In my last post I encouraged men to be emotionally blunt with their partners - to really desire them passionately in order to spark responsive attraction. Here I am encouraging you women to be rationally blunt with your partners, and to **cut out the emotional baggage**. 

Men are dumb. When we see you get emotional because of something we said, we go into damage control mode. Instead of trying to understand the emotion, we try to quash it, dispel it, even fight it. The truth is we don’t really know how to deal with it. The best way for you to overcome our slight mental deficiency is to *be blunt and minimally emotional* when you have something important to tell us. If you are blunt then we are unlikely to be able to misinterpret your intentions. If you are keeping your emotions under wraps then we won’t feel like you could get upset at any moment. We have no problem participating in a rational surface conversation. 

The final critical component is real consequences. Not only are we dumb, we’re kinda lazy (actually, almost everyone is). When you tell your husband that it hurts when he doesn’t desire you, but then you keep living the rest of your life as normal, you’re not giving him a good enough reason to change. Since he is considering this rationally, he sees change as difficult (it is), and he sees little repercussions for continuing the status quo. (Aside: these are not conscious decisions.) Yes, he does want to make you happy, but you only really seem unhappy when the topic of sex comes up. So when sex comes up he will quickly assure you that it will happen soon. If he is forced into sex it is likely plain and ends quickly. It’s a simple pattern, but one a lot of relationships are trapped in. If you’re thinking ‘he should want to change just for me’, you’re part of the problem because you are not acknowledging how motivation truly works.

So how does this apply itself to real life? Good question. If you are having occasional mediocre sex, you need to tell him it was mediocre. Consider saying something like: ‘I don’t feel like that was very great sex’. Be honest and blunt, and don’t accept shitty sex as a substitute, because then he will rationally file it away as ‘good enough, she’s happy!’. If you are not having much sex at all, have another talk with him about it. Here’s the golden rule: **do not lose your cool, whether it’s getting angry or crying**. As soon as your emotions show up his main concern will be addressing them immediately, and he will lose focus of the longer goal. Tell him exactly what you want, when you want it, and tell him that he needs to do some serious self-evaluation because you are no longer interested in continuing the status quo of this relationship. Be extremely cool about it. Listen: be cold. He will be nervous at how you seem unemotional about it. He will listen - he may not change, but he will listen. Tell him (coldly) that he needs to figure it out, but that you will absolutely be his moral support throughout. You can tell him you love him, as long as you can do so unemotionally. Never apologize for your desires. Offer some consequences that are realistic: ‘I'm finding myself starting to fantasize about other men’, ‘if you can’t build a physical connection with me, it might develop between me and someone else’, ‘I am not getting what I need out of this relationship, and I’m willing to give it up to get what I need!’. These sound harsh to our ‘suck it up for the sake of the marriage’ cultured brains, but that’s the point. Be honest with yourself, and choose a consequence that is both *concrete* and *realistic*. 

**tl;dr:** Men are dumb and lazy. Women: If you want change you must be blunt, unemotional, and direct with your consequences. Seeing consequences from you will have a million times more of an effect than seeing emotions. Also, you can’t fix him, so make it clear that you think it's a priority for him to self-examine. Support him if he decides to try.

As always, these are my own opinions, and results will vary. But honestly, what do you have to lose? No really, start by thinking about what you’re willing to lose to get that intimate connection with your man. That is your consequence. If you are willing to lose everything, you might have a chance.

We married knowing the full reality that we would be changing as we grew older, but that the reasons we love eachother will never change. The past year has changed us immensely, and we love eachother a million times more than when we married. All is well.

Except our sex is broken. We have talked SO much about this, I'm getting sick of it. I love being close to him, and loving him in my full capacity. But my body just doesn't respond to him anymore. It's not my sex drive, because I have plenty of that shit. It's frustrating. We have sex for like 10 minutes about once a week. I have some ideas of why this is happening, but as we try to fix it, nothing has changed. He is satisfied, so it just isn't going anywhere. He has a habit of finishing quickly, and going to bed. Since we've talked about this, he has tried finishing me off by hand after. This is a turnoff for me, I feel like a chore this way. He hates doing oral. I take good care of my cooch, because oral is my favorite.

Here's the worst- I have subconsciously taken my desires elsewhere. I now have a huge thing for his best friend, who reciprocates my small advances, which are starting to grow. In my head, this is way bigger than anyone knows. I don't have the reigns on this anymore. If we had sex, I know it would be amazing, because I am incredibly attracted to him in every way possible. It kills me. If he touched me, my fidelity would be over.

I told my husband that I am highly attracted to this guy, and he is ok. Their friendship is still strong. There is a lot of trust between the three of us, and we hang out often.

I just feel like I am a whore, and I'm stuck in a corner. I love my husband more than myself. I love his friend (as a friend). And his friend loves us. I am so afraid of ruining this. Wat do? :(

M, 39 Not Kinky and LL.",15,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/177t8m/f_27_kinky_and_hl_m_39_not_kinky_and_ll/,"I am going to try to make this as absolutely concise as possible. My apologies if I get a bit wordy, but I don't know who else to ask for advise. 

My husband and I met on a BDSM website. I was very involved in the local scene where I was from, and by chance ended up speaking to him (even though he lived 3,000 miles away). Again, by chance, ended up visiting his city on vacation with a friend of mine 6 months later. We immediately hit it off, and had an awesome time together. 

Fast forward 4 months and I actually packed up and moved to be with him. I knew I was taking a chance, it's just the type of person that I am. Almost immediately, I realized that he had an extremely LL (he didn't have sex with me in the first 3 weeks I lived with him). I chalked it up to business, some family things he had going on, etc. 

To be honest, I feel incredibly deceived. I don't know what he was doing on the website where we met. He's not kinky or even remotely interested in exploring anything sexually. I have begged him to share fantasies with me... he claims that he ""doesn't have any"". I have offered every possible solution under the sun, including me finding another partner for the kink activities... but he is TERRIFIED I will find another man and leave him over it. He KNOWS it is that important to me, but yet doesn't want to try to make it better. 

We ended up getting married about a year ago. Anyone I have ever explained our sex life to (Kinky or not) has said ""I cannot believe you didn't leave"". I can't believe I didn't leave. Adding to the complication, I am now 9 months pregnant (due next week). We have had sex 4 times since I found out I was pregnant in May (despite his incessant comments about how sexy I am pregnant, how beautiful I am, etc.) All of these times have been extremely uneventful and not satisfying to me in the least. The irritating thing too... is that right before I found out I was pregnant, I told him I didn't want to try anymore because I was SO frustrated that he never wanted to have sex and I was so, so angry. I honestly don't even know how we managed to get pregnant.

Sex aside, he is INCREDIBLY affectionate. He is always kissing me, touching me, rubbing me, snuggling, etc. and is an amazing husband. He takes care of me, makes me feel safe and secure... and would do anything I ask. I am tired of the tears and frustration... tired of crying myself to sleep. Tired of endless conversations with him (I am communicative- I don't expect him to be a mind reader!) Tired of being excited for the RARE opportunities (once a month or so?) where I am home alone and can satisfy myself sexually. 

I feel like what I have tried to do is push my sexuality aside... realize how lucky I am that everything else is so great. We really have a wonderful life together. I hoped that my fire and passion as a sexually submissive person would go away. It just doesn't... and now I am angry that I feel like I have to keep this part of me to myself.

Take the online quiz [here](http://www.outofservice.com/blirt/)

From their results page, there's a compatibility assessment that may be useful to us folks stuck in dead-bedrooms. Then again, the people running this are gathering data for themselves:

&gt;  Much of our research has examined this communication style and how it influences romantic relationships. Recent findings indicate that people are happiest in relationships when their blirt levels match. That is, whether it's 2 low blirters, 2 moderate blirters, or 2 high blirters, similarity in how intimate partners communicate with one another leads to heightened satisfaction. On the other hand, mismatches in blirtatiousness are associated with relatively low relationship satisfaction.

&gt; In addition, communication seems to unfold well if the man outscores the woman on the blirt by any amount. On the other hand, when the woman outscores the man on the blirt by any significant amount AND the woman scores in the ""high"" range on criticalness, then the members of the couple may experience challenges in communication that other couples do not. Of course, this finding is based on averages and there are always exceptions to such generalizations. Your relationship could be one such exception.

&gt; The questionnaires you have just completed are designed to extend these previous findings by examining why people with these communication styles experience difficulty. For example, we are wondering if men who are low blirters feel resentment toward blirtatious, critical women because such men feel that such women do not conform to the stereotypically feminine woman. Additionally, we hope to gain insight into how blirtatiousness interacts with other variables in determining relationship satisfaction.

A little background, we both met in undergrad school, 8 years ago, been in relationship for almost 7 of those years. When we first started dating, being in a country where its normal to live with your parents, we didn't have a place to get intimate etc. He never talks about sex. From the very first day. at all. we did not do the deed till 5 years into the relationship when we moved to a different country for our further studies. for the first 5 years, we would not even kiss everyday or get to hug each other because we wouldn't have a place to. once in a month or may be two, his parents or mine would go out of town and we would have the place to ourselves and still it was all under the t-shirt action, nothing below the belt. When I would ask him why this was, he would just have one answer: ""I don't know"". After moving here, I got my own place which I shared with my roommates but I could still get the place to myself more often. still, nothing much. If I invited him over, and tell him that we have the place to ourselves, he would come without condoms. Hell, not even talk about it. He would show up without them, it would disappoint me because i would feel I am asking for sex, more like begging for it. If he wants it, he should make the efforts of getting the protection without me telling him to, right? It just started feeling more and more like i wanted it and he didn't. If i ask him, he would say ""I do want it too"" and when I would respond ""why not bring the condoms?"" and he would say ""I don't know"". 

An entire almost went by, and things started to get frustrating for me and every time I would want to bring up the topic, he would not talk about it or just say i don't know why this happens. Then we decided to take a weekend together, I asked him to get the condoms and again, he shows up on the trip without any. We go buy some and we start the deed. we do it and it was okay. the first couple of times, we struggled because I would be dry and he didn't know any better because we were both virgins. If the first weekend you have with each other after such a long time and you just start having sex, you should be all over each other and not leave the room right? But, nothing such happened. We did it twice. very awkwardly. After coming back from there, I moved in with him and his roommates. I started sharing a room with him. Still the sex would be once a week or sometimes once in two weeks. It's almost as if I am the one who initiates it every time. I keep asking if he is not attracted to me anymore as I had put on weight, I started losing weight, working out, dropped 15 pounds. But still the same. He still would never tell me if he is horny. When I would go to the motherland for a month and we would talk everyday, not even once did he mention he was horny, or wanted to do it or anything for that matter related to sex. I, on the other hand, am completely opposite. my sex drive is much higher than him. I end up masturbating a couple of times in a week. When we have sex, I don't usually come by intercourse, which when I started reading about, found out that it's normal. So I suggested that he does some fingering first, and then penetrate. He just becomes so awkward as I feel like I have to teach him everything. I wanted him to read so that he knows, I even showed him the right way of fingering that I saw a sex ed video of. We haven't tried anything new, just the missionary and me on top positions. I lately, have become more and more frustrated as he does not put much efforts into it. He enters, comes in a couple of minutes, asks me if I finished or not. I lied twice at first, but then started being honest about it.  I also asked him to bring some lube so that fingering would be easier, but he forgot to get it for almost a month. When I got upset about it, he brought it the next day. after that, we have been having sex once a week, sometimes may be once in two weeks. I have tried talking to him about all of this. told him everything I have written here. But his answer to all this is ""I don't know"". Last week, I thought I needed to ask some much required questions. I asked him what turns me on in the bed. He starts to guess. I asked him how my vagina looks like. and he says i have just seen it a couple of times. I was appalled by his answers and I don't really know what to do. 

Apart from the sex life, we do have some issues for communication. His answer to everything is ""I don't know"". He is a great guy, very affectionate, but in a childish manner most of the time. I am really stuck here. I don't know what to do or how to make this better. It feels as if He is really shy and when I try to make him more comfortable by trying to be naked around him more, or ask him to take showers with me. But nothing. Everytime we have sex, he finishes, asks me if I have come, when I say I didn't, and that he could help me finish, he would smile and try for a min and keep asking ""did you come now?"" and I would just lose the mood for it. I am someone who loves to communicate, talk things out but he just shuts himself up. He has never raised any questions about our sex life. i am the only one who brings it up. I feel selfish trying to complain about this and slowly started getting content about once a week sex or once in two weeks but I still need to talk about it. He doesn't hug much, or kiss. when he kisses, and I use my tongue, he tries to use it, but the kiss becomes awkward and this slowly just turns me off. I feel like I am putting a lot of efforts but to no avail. and this is making me lose hope day by day and I fear it will drive me away from him. Is 7 years too long for someone to open up to you? 

May be, this is a wrong subreddit, but I am a fairly new user and if someone could help me find a more appropriate sub reddit for this, it would be really helpful. I really need some perspective here as i am not able to talk about this with anyone. I would really appreciate any advice.

There was concern over my drinking in order to relax enough to have sex.  I will no longer be doing this, we will be working towards healthy solutions together.

We talked a lot about our hopes and dreams and realized that we still want them to happen together and a healthy reality check made him realize that without a lifestyle change, things like more kids will not happen.

I'm laying on the sofa in the living room at 5:30 in the morning, wide awake, unable to sleep, so pissed off that I could seriously either hurt myself or burst into tears. Somehow I'm managing not to do either.

I have posted here once before a long time ago now (months), but forgive me because I feel as if I don't say something somewhere I will crack.

My partner is literally almost my twin. I don't think I've ever come across two people more alike than we are. Except in the sex department. He has not ever considered sex a mandatory thing, or for example, he can live with it or without it. 

However, we have spoken, he understands and even WANTS to want it more and WANTS to oblige in whatever way possible, whenever possible. But now I'm shoving a figurative knife down my own throat. 

I'm extremely HL, but oddly enough, I am also extremely shy about those sorts of things. Last night I got absolutely drunk and apparently jumped him big time, but I couldn't remember a thing and I was told it didn't get anywhere. Today after I was feeling better we were flirting all day and I thought that maybe, just maybe, tonight (his last weekend night off work) would be the night. No such luck, nerves got the best of me AND I knew he was tired so I attached some guilt right on it.

I suppose now would be the time to mention that I ONLY get sexytimes chances twice a week on his weekend days, but sex happens about once every other weekend on average if I'm lucky. 

Unlike many of you here my partner wants a higher libido, is willing to interact, but still isn't there yet and my shy nature towards it mixed with a HIGH libido (I literally can be wild when my inhibitions go away. Yay liquor.), I'm spinning in a circle of perpetual failure.

Feels better getting this off my chest but I still don't know what the fuck to do. I'm so mad at myself for not being able to go for it, so mad at the situation, so upset at feeling led on though I KNOW that was NEVER his intention and I won't let my retarded brain blame him for it. But I want to cry, or break something. But instead I lay here. Confessing all of this to however many random individuals on the internet, with less than half battery life, still wide awake and unable to sleep. Bitter that work starts for him again later today (he's a cna and is always tired after work, which makes me feel guilty for even thinking of bothering him, though he insists its not bothersome at all). Pissed off that the only time I got the wild or even AT ALL 'loves' recently was when I was too drunk to even perform or remember anything. 


Maybe I don't deserve the love which I seek. And I'm guessing there aren't many people out there like me. Sorry for ranting. Feel free to post advice, but I don't expect anything. I'm seeing a counselor at the moment, by the way. I will be mentioning this all to her during my next visit which is tomorrow. But still. Sigh.

We're both 26 and have been together 3.5 years, but have known each other 10+ years. At the beginning of our relationship the sex was awesome and frequent. About a year after we started dating we decided that I should go on the birth control pill and as the story goes, I lost my sex drive relatively quickly. Sex became much less frequent (once a month, maybe) and I started to feel a lot of pressure from him. He's horny basically all the time and would be perfectly fine having sex 4-5 times a day. At my highest libido I was fine with once a day/several times a week. He also tends to beg or get frustrated when I say no. We couldn't snuggle or sit on a couch or bed together without him trying something or begging for a blow job. 

Then I suffered a series of blood clots as a side effect from the birth control pills and had to immediately stop taking them. It took more than a year to get my hormones back in check and feel more or less normal. In August I found out I was pregnant and then suffered a miscarriage. So yeah it's been a hell of a two years for me.

I think we've been making progress dealing with our issues over the past few months and we went from having sex maybe once a month to several times a week. We had a talk about it tonight. He feels like shit because he's horny all the time and hates himself for begging. He also seems to think he should somehow try to make himself less horny and I'm not even sure what that means. I feel like shit because I feel like it's my fault. I've really been making an effort to have sex more often and I don't mean just for his sake but I've really been making an effort to get in the mood, initiate things and enjoy it. 

Other than the sex, we have an amazing relationship. We're very affectionate toward each other and always have been. He's really a wonderful supportive partner, but I'm not sure how to solve this problem.

How do I fix this when it's my issue? I'm (f) early/mid 20s, he's mid/late 20s. When we first met, 4 years ago, our sex drives were perfectly compatible. 

About 4 months after we moved in together, I went on the birth control shot, Depo Provera. This shot caused me a huge host of problems, two of them being complete loss of sex drive and weight gain. I'm about 80lbs above my healthy weight now. 

About a year and a half into our relationship, we decided we wanted kids and I went completely off birth control for it. My sex drive sky rocketed. In the two months of actively trying to conceive, we had more sex than we had in the previous year.

I got pregnant and had a horrible, high-risk pregnancy and my sex drive tanked again. After delivery and before I went back on birth control, I was counting the days until we could do it. I held out two weeks and had sex with condoms until I got the Mirena IUD put in. I was one of the very few people who had some bad side effects (constant spotting, low libido, worsening acne) and dealt with it for 8 months before I got it removed.

For a couple weeks after removal, my sex drive was okay but it's gotten worse since. We no longer worry about BC as he got snipped at the beginning of the year.

Currently, we're having sex maybe twice a month. When we do have sex, I'm perfectly satisfied (as is he) and once I get into it, I get into it but the problem lies in actually getting into it. I simply have no desire for sex. I know the weight is part of the problem but that can't be everything, right? I know this issue lies with me as my husband has brought it up that he's unhappy with our physical relationship.

1346184790.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,yz9p6,I'm loosing my sanity here,20,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/yz9p6/im_loosing_my_sanity_here/,"I've been trying to improve my marriage/relationship with my wife.  After a few arguments and discussions with my wife, I realized I wasn't putting enough effort into showing affection towards her.   She complained about not enough affection, sex was few and far between, that sort of stuff.  Last time was an eye opener and I realized that I need to ""pull my weight"" as far as affection.

There have been, on many occasions, will I will either hint around to a desire for sexy times with my wife, or I'll flat out say, hey, how about a nice romantic evening tonight.  I'll usually say this at the beginning of the week, and each night I hear ""How about tomorrow"".  When Thursday or Friday rolls around, an argument ensues due to again having to wait.

Not to long ago my wife told me she said ""I've noticed you're trying harder at this relationship"".  I was happy to have her notice.

This past week, I tried again.  Tuesday originally propositioned her.  ""Not tonight, tomorrow?"".  Wednesday ""not feeling up to it, tomorrow"".  Thursday, she gets home after a dinner out with family.  She's talking, and I'm cuddling with her.  She then looks at me, and says ""I'm not comfortable with this""  ""Not now"" ""etc"".

I'm beyond pissed at this point.  Three days of delaying sex, after being told ""It'll happen tomorrow"".  I'm pissed, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm confused, all in one.  

She said she expects certain things, like affection, etc.  OK, I got that.  Thats why I have tried a lot harder to make her feel good about herself.  She said she noticed!  She even mentioned that she noticed how hard I was trying.  I was trying hard?  Yet that's not good enough?  What must I do?  

I tell her that she's complained about the frequency of our sex life.  Well hell, here I am trying to increase it.  I'm feeling myself tear up, explain how I aware of her feelings, in a past argument about her concern about not enough sex.  She rarely initiates, its usually all on me to initiate.  I've gotten to the point where I don't want to initiate, because I know I'll get rejected, shot down.

I'm crying.  I feel helpless.  I hear her pleas, and I take steps to improve myself and address her concerns.  She responds positively at my attempts to show her more love and affection, yet it isn't good enough.

I'm now depressed.  I'm confused about all of this, and I can't help but feel anger as well.   I'm sad that I'm putting all this effort into it, and it isn't feeling like it is reciprocated.  I know not all the problems in our relationship are 100% on my shoulders, so it saddens me that I feel like I'm putting 100% of the effort in now to repair it.  It depresses me.  I'd like more sex, twice a week plus some oral once in a while would be awesome.  I have to settle on once a month now, which appears to be the average.  If she wants me to put more effort now into it now than I already am, will that get me the amount of physical affection I'm looking for?  I'm not sure what to do.  I'm angry too because of the promises I'm being made saying ""It'll happen tomorrow"" and the obvious happens where it doesn't.  My confusion comes in where she complains about the frequency of sexual intimacy and then ignores it when I try to fix the problem.

",22,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/yw84l/feels_like_were_nearing_the_end_my_life_is/,"Ok,  jeez, this is a long one. Props to those who read through to understand my situation / rant. 

My wife(f29) and I (m32) have been together for nearly 8 years.  We got married 3 years ago. We have a 2 year old son. He's the light of my life and she comes in a close second. For most of the time we've been together, we've been awesome. We've had our fights here and there, but never a separation or sleeping on the couch or anything like that. 

She's the sort of quirky out of the box girl with a lot of energy and really smart wit.  I'm more of the Hank Hill middle of the road type of guy, not conservative or anything, but just a bump on a log. I don't like to dance, socially awkward, prefer evenings in, but I'm generally the nicest guy you'll meet. I always make sure those around me are happy, and that's always my number one concern. 

For the past year or so, things have been going down hill.  I can count on one hand the amounts sexual situations we've had since Christmas, and most of those have felt sort of ""forced"" if that makes sense. 

She has had some serious depression for the past year, and it's getting really bad lately.  We've had some serious discussions about the future of the marriage and it doesn't seem too great. Earlier this year she had flat out told me ""I don't find you attractive anymore"" and a few months later ""I love you, but not in that way anymore"" needless to say, this makes it pretty hard to try to put the moves on someone you are in love with, and its hard to come to terms with the idea that she probably thinks its ""blegh"" to be advanced on by me.   I've been Hitting the gym, and trying to be super awesome with her, but the results just seem like she's tolerating me. 


Before we were together, she was very promiscuous.  She even admits that she lost count, but it was probaarma around the 40-50 mark.  Crazy, I know, but she decided to settle down with me.  I had some weird thoughts about that at first, but I got through it.  

I've come to the conclusion that she misses how she used to be. Not necessarily being promiscuous, but being adventurous and being able to just go do whatever she wants without needing to answer to someone else. 

By no means do I put her on a leash. In fact, 99% of the time, if she wants to go out and our son is sleeping, I stay back and she goes out.  We rarely ever go out together, and when we do we have almost nothing to talk about with each other.  And just end up shooting the shit and being funny, but like normal friends would and not a couple. 

Anyway, it's been getting really bad lately, and she seems to be finding fault with almost everything I do.  I specifically make efforts to help her or make things nice for her and upon completing said actions I'm almost always greeted with either a problem with the way I did it, or at the very least, no ""thanks"" or even acknowledgement that I was being nice.   Sometimes I linger around just to try to make a point that she should thank me. And it doesn't work half the time. 

She seems to be in such a bad mood all the time that she can't see the nice things anymore.  I know her bad mood is only caused by our relationship, because she is almost always in a great mood when she's away from me. 

Anyway, to the controversial portion of this post.

We were out to dinner tonight, and she left to go to the bathroom, while leaving her phone with our son to play some puzzles.  Well him being 2, he hit some other buttons and exited out of the game he was playing and got fed up.  I grabbed to phone to get it back on the game and noticed it was opened to an SMS conversation with a guy friend of hers. Someone we were both friends with in the city we used to live in a year ago,  halfway across the country. 

The gist of what I saw, was him saying how much of a boner she gives him, and her agreeing and reciprocating the idea.  Then confessing her total love for him, and not just because of the ""awesome cuddles"" but because of their interactions and how well they mesh together.  I had just sent her on a mini vacation to visit some friends in our old home-town.  It was a surprise gift for our 3 year anniversary. And one of those friends told me that instead of staying the night at their place, she crashed at his place.  She had originally said they all crashed there together, but then pretended I didn't hear it right when she said that, and that they just hung out. I pretty much called her on it and she swore up and down that she's been an absolute saint and would never cheat on me. 

Personally, after reading the conversation she had with the guy, I can't help but feel cheated on.   There was no deep mention of anything sexual, per-say, but the ""awesome cuddles"" comment, along with the boner talk and the profession of love are pretty much horrible to find.  I had so much adrenaline and shock pumping through my veins when I read it, I hardly knew what to do. I gave the phone back to our son, and kept quiet at dinner. Trying to be nice as if I didn't know.  I didn't want a huge argument in public, and when we got home I just didn't know what to do.  I stayed out in the garage, and she stayed in the family room.  She's sleeping now and I'm not sure what I should do or say next. 

The thought of tearing up my family is making me ill. I couldn't stand the thought of not being around them, and not being able to see my son every day. We have such a bond that I never knew we could have. We even have inside jokes, and he's only 2!  It pains me to think of a future where I see him for only short periods of the week, and can't be there whenever I want. To be alone in some cheap apartment with no one around, left to silence. Even typing that out has me nearly in tears.  I've had reoccurring nightmares about the situation and I wake up in shambles. 

I'm not sure what to do next here. I know this sort of behavior should be unacceptable.  That I should just start filing for divorce and not look back. But I really want to make this work. My wife has been the best thing to ever come into my life, and to see her on this downward spiral this year pains me so much. I love her so much and her family has become my second family as well. I can't stand the thought of pulling our family apart. We work together awesomely as a family unit, just this stuff with her and I has become a big player in day to day life. 

I know this isn't a strictly dead-bedroom scenario, although I'm pretty sure most of it is reason to cause it. 

What the hell am I supposed to do here? I don't want to be the one to initiate the horrible action. I can't be the fault here. Everyone would just blame me for not making it work and taking the ""easy way out"" by not working through it. 

I have discussed counseling with her and her response 2 months ago was ""it is what it is.... I don't think it's worth the trouble, it's mostly your stuff you need to work out""

I'm just really left with no idea of how to move forward. I would be a husk of a man at the end of a divorce in this scenario. The 2 things in my life that keep me going everyday stripped away from me in a very permanent way.  Yes, I'd still be around my son a  bit, but selfishly, I want to be around him every day, to follow our routine and teach him all the cool things he needs to know.  Being a father has given me so much reason in this world. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I didn't know where else to post about this and have been lurking this subreddit for a week or two.  If nothing else, tell me it's going to be ok. Give me reason to believe I should have reason in this world after losing the most important things in it.  I don't want my son to look at me as a failure, and I don't want to leave him behind without his dad.

First off I'd like to say that you are all awesome. If it wasn't for this place I would've felt so alone. 

I'm a 25m and my girlfriend is a 23f. We are both in great shape (avid runners) and are very easy going people. We've been together for almost 3.5 years now and couldn't be happier, except...well...you all know.

When we started dating it was great, the best I could ever hope for. Frequency was 5ish times a week, and our record was 7 times in one day! Then after a year together it slowed greatly to 1-2 times a month. Then we moved in together a year ago and it got even worse. When we started dating, we once discussed how long we've gone without sex since our first time. Me: 1 year Her: 4 months. It has now been 5 months since we last had sex with only 3 sessions of foreplay leading to her being satisfied. Her record is broken I suppose. 

Before we were together I had 2 other partners and things were so so. I actually had a similar problem with an ex and broke it off because I was not happy. But now I am extremely happy in every way but this. She has had a pretty exciting sex life before me with 5 partners and some curious fetishes. We have never done any of them despite my attempts. 

When we talk about sex she always says how good it is and sounds like she loves it. Her actions say otherwise because when I attempt any move I am instantly rejected. If I try a long kiss she backs out after 1 second. I tried the 10 second kiss idea and she said I can't force that. If I try to feel her up she just says ""What do you think you're doing?"" or ""And what do YOU want?"" (playfully, sort of, more like I'm a 10 year old boy) which makes me feel ashamed to desire anything. If I try to text her dirty messages (which we always used to do) it's always an ""Oh you!"" type of response.

About a month ago we tried mojoupgrade and really had fun doing it. We learned a lot and it got us talking...and that's all. The only time anything ever happens is when we've been drinking and she gets really into it and says she loves it. The last time we fooled around we almost had sex but it turned out she is too tight for me now. I suggested that we have fun to fix this, and she agreed with a smile. Nothing since then. 

So I'm about to have the talk, probably in a month since we have a few vacations coming up. Any advice from you fine people would be appreciated. Thanks! I'll probably end up editing this with more details. 

EDIT: I just wanted to add that it's not even the sex that I miss, it's the intimacy and the fun of it all. I'm always down to cuddle but she isn't.

We actually want to have sex.  It's just not working for whatever reason.

So, this is our crazy idea--Positive Behavior Supports

This is the same thing that schools use to promote positive behavior and extinguish unwanted behaviors.  This is a ""proven"" method to shape behavior.

So-I have literally made ""masterbucks"" featuring ""Uschlickes S. Grant"" and ""Thomas Jerkofferson"".

Working together last night we made a list of things we can do to earn our ""masterbucks"".

-sex
-foreplay
-15 minutes of cleaning (it needs to get done-let's reward ourselves!)
-15 minutes of laundry/dishes
-activities done together (dog park, movie, playing a video game together, cooking, dinner, etc)
-date night


Things we can spend our ""masterbucks"" on:

-oral sex
-pick a position
-pick a location
-tie up
-talk dirty
-sex toy of choice
-act out a fantasy
-sex outfit
-masturbation 

With this masturbation is allowed, but it costs bucks that could otherwise go towards something sexual together.  

I'm printing the coupons on two colors (mine/his) and that way we can buy coupons towards either person.  So, he could buy a blue oral sex coupon to ask me to do that for him.  Or, he could buy a pink oral sex coupon to say that he wants to go down on me.  

It's kinda fun, it's kinda goofy.  It probably won't work for a lot of couples because it is ""out there.""  But, we both want to fix this problem.  Just for some reason we're not able to do this out of our own willpower.

Perhaps there is somewhere else more focused on my specific issues. Please turn me away if that is the case. 

I am a 29 year old female. 
Unfortunately I have a very long history of sexual abuse. My stepfather was abusive towards me for a period of many many years (rape and other sexual abuse, as well as emotional and physical abuse). This happened for a period of 11 years. My mother knows and is still married to him. I have no contact with mother/stepfather or their two children together because of this. I clearly have *some* issues from this, but all in all, I turned out basically as well as anyone could hope having gone through that. 

My husband is 30, and we've been married for 6 years. Our marriage was very fast. I had just moved countries to be with him after 'online dating' for about 6 months. His parents, convinced that I was of the devil, insisted on us marrying the moment I arrived here, so that I could not tempt him to have sex with me and lead him straight towards hell. We were married within a week of me arriving.  

We had sex in the first few months, not often, but enough that it didn't seem to be an issue and I don't remember it being bad, or really awkward. But it trailed off really quickly. 

His 3 younger brothers lived with us for the first 5 years of our marriage. For me this was a major issue, I highly value my privacy and despite how many times I pointed out that I couldn't live like that, things never changed. The longer we lived with them the less I was interested in sex. There were always people in the house.  This wasn't the only issue that stopped us having sex. Our relationship suffered. I was sad and miserable. This changed when the last of his brothers moved out. 

I think at this point we haven't had sex in about 4 years. 

I'd like to fix it. 

Sometimes  I have flashbacks during sex which are pretty crippling and sometimes the after-effects of that can last days. And I know this makes him anxious, he's terrified of hurting me, emotionally or physically. I'm terrified of the flashbacks too. But they don't happen all the time, or even the majority of the time. But they are unpredictable. 

He has never been with anyone but me. He is also quite anxious about sex, about his performance. In the past I've found the pressure to enjoy the sex so overwhelming because I don't want to disappoint him. 

May of last year we finally got rid of the last of his brothers. Our relationship has improved a million times since then. Honestly he is absolutely amazing and he has dealt with the lack of sex like a complete champ. I couldn't ask for more in a husband. 

I'd like for us to be having sex. Or at least trying. But I don't know how to bring it up. After 4 years it's so easy to just not. 

I know the obvious answer is simply ""Just go jump him"" or 'talk to him about it'. We've never been great at talking about it. And I'm worried that if we do try having sex, and something happens (like a flashback) that it will deflate him.

I'll have a lot of work to do but it's worth it because she's working too on resolving her issues. 

The good thing that happened is that we talked about sex before going to sleep and she was not angry. Also I caressed her all over the place (back, legs, arms, hands, an even breasts, but not more, not in the pants), and she said at the same time that she loved that because it was respectful.

Another strange thing that I discovered is that I'm a noob at sex, but that's another story. I understood that if I stop smoking I'll be able to clearly think about her 100% the next time we have sex. I'm a noob at sex because my desires and fantasies are undefined right now, but if the issues are resolved, I could free my inner beast and be happy.

1340335285.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,vf214,had a somewhat promising talk with my husband,16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/vf214/had_a_somewhat_promising_talk_with_my_husband/,"background post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/tkszx/first_post_lengthy_deadbedroom_for_4_years/)

asked my husband a few weeks ago to do the mojoupgrade survey with me. he refused, saying he felt we didn't need it since we could just talk to each other about sex. so i told him how we were coming up on 5 years of no sex and i was afraid if we don't do it soon we never will. and i told him that there were things he didn't like doing to me that i really missed.

he said he wants to have sex with me. he says he never minded going down on me (this almost made me cry, because if it's true why has he been so resistant to perform oral these 15 years we've been together). he also said it's not so much that he doesn't like fingering me, but when we first started dating i asked him to change his technique and he felt like he was being compared to my ex-boyfriend. so i asked him if he could see how lopsided his thinking was since he spent months giving me suggestions and directions on how he wanted me to perform oral on him. after a long pause he agreed it wasn't fair.

to this date we still haven't had sex and he still hasn't come close to initiating. but i do know he is physically attracted to me again. i have lost all the weight i had previously gained, and am actually in better shape than i was before getting pregnant. 

the fact i am now ""fuckable"" in his eyes, yet he still won't have sex with me was doing a number on my head. i still had a lot of anger and resentment towards him. and even though i knew my body looked good, my self esteem was still so very low. as a quick fix i posted a pic to r/gonewild (i have since deleted it) and the attention i received did help me feel better about myself. it helped me see there were men out there who would desire me. it helped me really understand that this is my husband's issue, not mine.

so i'm trying to let go of my anger and resentment. i realize that even if my husband and i do start having sex again, i will not have a fulfilling sexual relationship with him. i am trying to do things that make me happy, that bring me some sense of fulfillment, that way i will hopefully be welcoming to my husband if he ever does decide to sleep with me again. 

and i'm trying to focus on the fact that he truly does love me. that he's super affectionate in every other way and that he always tries to do what's best for me and our child. i don't know if the pain from his years of rejection will ever go away, but hopefully it will become a dull, manageable pain.

1336612370.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,tfotg,How to explain to your partner WHY sex is important and why DB hurts?,17,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/tfotg/how_to_explain_to_your_partner_why_sex_is/,"I've searched pages and pages of old DB posts trying to find some advice on this and haven't really found what I'm looking for. I tried to be brief, but still cover all my bases. Go to the TL;DR if it's too much!  I tried to do paragraph breaks but can't figure it out for the life of me. Sorry :\

My boyfriend (27) and I (f/26) have been together almost 2 years. I've known he has a low libido from the start, but in the past 6 months or so, it has gotten worse. Part of it is that he's away almost every weekend (pursuing outdoor hobby stuff w/friends) and we see each other 1x MAYBE 2x a week. We don't live together.  

I miss him while he's gone and am always excited to see him so we can talk face-to-face and so I can be physically close to him (cuddle, hug etc). When we were seeing each other more often during the week (and on weekends) and not having sex every time, I was OK; I can handle that. But it's gotten to the point where we don't have sex that one time we see each other and it BOTHERS ME. He seems totally oblivious to the fact that we haven't had sex in 2+ weeks. It's hard enough for me to deal with him being physically absent, but the fact that sex with me doesn't even cross his mind when he hasn't seen me in 7 days and won't see me for another 7 days really.fucking.hurts.

I got upset this morning after no sex. We've discussed this before and I've been pretty honest about my needs and feelings, but nothing has ever changed drastically. However, I also think it is harder to measure progress when we don't see each other very much, but I'm at my breaking point. 
  
  
  
These are some ways he's responded to this situation:
-He feels like a piece of meat
-Asks why spending a whole night talking and cuddling isn't good enough for me
-He's tired/stressed from work, isn't that into having sex during the week (except it doesn't happen with any consistency on the weekends we actually do get to spend together either, so I'm not buying it. Plus, he LEAVES almost every weekend to go skiing or fishing, so yeah, that weeknight is our only opportunity and he knows it)
-He likes sex in the morning (except sex in the morning has started happening less and less and less)
-Says he gets horny at certain times and those are usually times I'm not around, like Sunday nights when he gets home. That my presence alone (which includes laying in bed together naked) doesn't make him horny (that didn't hurt at all...)  
-He does watch porn, he does masturbate. He has said he does it (masturbate, at least) every day or so. (I mostly believe him on this, but I have wondered if he's said that so I don't think he's just totally asexual all the time) 
-He feels inadequate as a man that he can't keep up with me and might lose the relationship because of it
  
  
As much as it breaks my heart, I am fully prepared to end our relationship over this, which he knows. However, I am willing to talk about it to try to make him understand and give him one more chance because I haven't been perfect either. When do talk about it, he says he feels inadequate. I know I might've been harsh at times instead of more understanding/non-judgmental, but it's only because I've felt so hurt and rejected. I realize it's counter-productive and I don't want to hurt his self-esteem. I have verbalized many times how it's all about my wanting to feel close and connected to him. I want to have sex with HIM, not just have sex to feel physically satiated. 

TL;DR: 
Question #1: Boyfriend has a low libido and doesn't understand why it hurts me so much that he never initiates. How do I explain to him why it's important to me and why it's not just about ""getting off""? I need help putting it into words.

Question #2: How do I initiate? I used to initiate a lot more and I almost never now because my self-esteem has taken a hit and I don't want to get rejected again. I admit I need to get better at this but I'm afraid. I don't know how to start being sexual when he's not giving any signs that he would be interested, and how not to assume he's not into it if I had to be the one to initiate.

1335177482.0,16,self.DeadBedrooms,snzls,Signs of coming out of a slump...maybe,17,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/snzls/signs_of_coming_out_of_a_slumpmaybe/,"So I've been following this for a while, since a lot of the stuff posted here applies to me.  I thought it was time for a (maybe) ray-of-hope post.

My girlfriend and I are both in our mid-to-late 30s, and have been together for over 15 years.  She's beautiful and I love her dearly - we have one of those ""everything is great except for the sex"" relationships you read about so much.  The ones that make you furious at the ""just dump her"" posts.

But recently I'd been getting really close to wanting to break up.  Over the past 5 or so years, our sex became less and less frequent.  It's always been pretty conventional, almost always in the bedroom, and not all that frequent, but still good.  She is a bit of a workaholic with a generally low libido, not terribly experimental, and I'm not a very take-charge kind of guy.

I've always had trouble because I take too long, she's not capable of more than one orgasm (well, she is, but it hurts her) and we've never really been able to talk very openly about sexual matters - I don't think it's because she's embarrassed, she just isn't that into the idea of discussing new stuff.  Her attitude's always been ""don't talk, just do"" and despite our long time together, despite the fact that I'm generally pretty self-confident I'm pretty insecure about asking her to try things, it's just who I am, so that's already a bit of a weird combination, but it worked.   

So about 2 years ago, she started having vaginal pains during intercourse - I suspect it was some sort of vaginismus.  It got to the point where we could not have penetrative sex any more, it hurt her too much.  One of her gynecologists told her that she had a terrible PH-imbalance in her lady bits, and switched her to a new kind of lower-hormone pill and medication, which started clearing it up a bit, but we still couldn't have sex, it didn't clear it up.  Recently she'd been turning me down and blowing me off consistently, to the point where I just found myself no longer caring, and she didn't seem to realize how much that was fucking me up - to the point of telling me to just go jerk off one night when I told her I was really horny - and then she just shut down completely.  

The whole thing was exacerbated by the fact that I think I'm a pretty nice, decent guy, fairly considerate, neither a total fat orc nor some glamorous model-man playboy, I know there are probably millions of thing I could do differently or better, but she'd told me a number of times she found me attractive.  I guess there's no accounting for taste.

I'd brought up the topic about lacking sex quite often, trying to phrase it in a non-accusatory way (before you ask, this is before I found this reddit and read the sidebar stuff) - and it was like we were just talking past each other.  She's often tired from work and has her mind on other things, I'm increasingly frustrated (and ""performance anxiety"" made it difficult to get what I want from sex anyway, thus causing her frustration because in her eyes I didn't seem to be enjoying myself as she couldn't get me off - and the risk of causing her pain made me very reluctant to ask her to try to do things differently).  I felt bad bringing up the subject of sex, because it felt like I was pressuring her, despite her stressful job and other responsibilities.

A new gynecologist advised her to try a [Mirena](http://www.mirena-us.com/) IUD - she was unsure about it, due to the many really horrid reviews that women online gave it, including massive bleeding, constant pain, lowered sex drive, the list goes on.  So she got it a few weeks ago - and our sexual interactions went from ""almost nothing"" to ""zero"" nearly overnight.  She was very open about the fact that most women take a few weeks to adapt to it, so I tried to understand, but I found myself manning the flagpole more than usual and becoming increasingly frustrated and feeling rejected.  

I mean, I'm living with this smoking hot, intelligent, successful woman, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to go into monk mode.  This is exacerbated by her always having been open about wanting a child, and me not being really all that ready for it - now that I've reached the point where I see it as ""yeah, sure, why not"" more often than not, I'm utterly terrified of having a burst of sexual activity leading to pregnancy, then bam, being tied to a sexless relationship for the rest of eternity because now there's no way to just end it and walk off.

So yesterday morning, after many weeks of building frustration, I decided to give it another shot when we were in bed in the morning - and if she turned me down again, I was prepared to just end it, I was that head-fucked.  And lo and behold, she responded and it was some of the best, most intense sex I remember having.  I think I still need to get used to actually having intercourse, so it's time to go ""hands off"" for a few weeks and see if that works, but at least we did something again.

I strongly suspect that hormones from the pill had something to do with it, although I can't be sure.  When we started, she had a bit of a twinge, but her gynecologist had advised her to try different positions, and we found one that appeared to work - I assume the medication and switch to an IUD tremendously helped with the pain, making it go away except in very particular positions.  At least now I know our sexual relationship isn't totally dead, and there's some hint of a hope of light at the end of the tunnel.  I told her how awesome it was and that I'd rarely seen her so into sex.  She also seemed happier and relaxed.

I can't make any predictions, but I'm hoping this is something we can keep up.  I'm going to give it a shot again, and we'll see where it goes...",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_snzls,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/snzls/signs_of_coming_out_of_a_slumpmaybe/,

We're very emotionally and intellectually compatible but the sex has been a real problem for me. Almost 4 years ago, I cheated on him. I confessed immediately and we decided to stay together and work on it. Today, it's gotten a little better but it's still nowhere near the frequency or intensity that I need and I can feel myself drifting again. 

He claims to have a low libido and I've seen it in evidence; he doesn't masturbate that I know of, and doesn't watch porn at all. I've never been with a guy that just had no interest in sex. He told me once that he wasn't always like that; I tried to find out a bit more about what changed and learned two things: he had a gf before me that didn't want any sex and he ""got used to it"", and he's scared he might have some kind of medical thing happening. I've begged him to go to the doctor but on the handful of occasions he's gone, he always ""forgets"" to talk about this. I've asked him to go to couples counselling but he won't go. 

He asked me to marry him 3 years ago, and I said yes but we haven't started planning the wedding. TBH, I'm scared of fully committing myself to a relationship where my needs aren't important. That's how I feel. I love him so much, I never want to be apart from him but I know I can't live like this forever. I'm amazed I've lasted this long. Sex has always been important to me and it feels like torture to live this way. Not to mention the fact that I want children and my window of opportunity is closing fast.

When we do have sex, it's always me that initiates it with rare exception. The longest we went was about 6 months, back before the infidelity. Now I keep track and make sure we at least have sex once a month when I'm ovulating. Stupid, I know... 

I hate that he doesn't want me. I feel so rejected and alone sometimes. We spend almost all our time together and we're best friends, but sometimes I feel like that's all we are. I know he loves me and wants me to be happy and I hate him for putting me through this. If he really cares, why won't he go to the doctor, or counselling, or ... *something*?? 

I woke up one day last week with one thought in my head: I have to leave. I don't feel like this is ever going to change and I don't think I can take it anymore. I hate myself for feeling this way and I'm terrified of losing him, but spending the rest of my life feeling this way just isn't an option.

When I told him about the affair, he promised he would go see a doctor. He promised we would go to counselling. He swore he would make more of an effort, and he did for a little while. But it never felt like he was really into it; it felt forced. I know he's going to say the same things again. How am I going to deal with that? I want to give him another chance, I want this to work, I want to be happy with him. Desperately. But how long am I supposed to wait???

Been together for going on 3 years.  Engaged for 4 months.  Started out very strong, sex all the time, new places, positions, types (oral, mutual masturbation, etc) Without sign of slowing down.

8 months in, started slowing down.  Started not liking oral (giving or receiving)  Moved in together at a year in.  Picked back up temporarily (quick access to each other I imagine).  Since then, it has been on a steady nose dive where I might be lucky to get sex once or twice a month.  There was a couple periods where we go for a couple of months without, followed by out of nowhere, once a day for 3 days.

During these periods, there is little to no physical affection, no oral or mutual masturbation, no offers to take care of physical needs.

When we do have sex, foreplay is strictly not allowed.  No making out, no oral, no handjobs/fingering.  Minimal groping or nipple play is allowed.  We stick to a couple of positions which work for her, and I can no longer get her to talk dirty, or even respond verbally when I ask if she is enjoying what im doing.

Regarding talking about the problem;  been there.  The main argument she has is that she is unhappy with her body image.  She feels bigger than she has ever been.  I make a very very concerted effort to spend time with her, do things together, treat her well.  I am going to the gym on a regular basis, and we have a membership together.  She however, refuses to put a priority on her physical appearence.  She is able to find just as many excuses to not go to the gym, as she has been able to find to not have sex.  I have explained over and over that this is a physical need for me, and not just for sexual gratification, but for general happiness, and feeling appreciated and needed.  I have explained that my personal value and self esteem level is heavily influenced by our intimacy level.  I have used the ""roommate"" argument a couple of times now, that the extreme lack of intimacy is making our relationship into just a friendship.

Her argument is ""Just go jerk off""

Im in between a rock and a hard place.  We are engaged to be married.  We are currently living with her folks while we save money for a house/wedding/honeymoon, and bill payoffs.  We can move out, but if we did, we would need to push the wedding off a bit further.  She has mentioned that being in the same house with her folks drives her libido down.  How the fuck does she think I feel?  For the record, this is a choice we both made, not a situation we were forced into.  I make over 50k a year, so I could easily handle a place.  She doesnt really bring anything financially to the relationship.  She is in school and works part time.  That doesnt bother me much, since I'm used to taking care of as much as I can.  She said it kind of bothers her that she cant contribute, but I have tried to ease those worries.

I dont know..Im just...Im at a fucking loss.  I love her to death.  She is my best friend, and someone I enjoy spending a shit ton of time with.

I discovered this subreddit the other day and was amazed that there are plenty of others experiencing similar circumstances of my own life.  I'll just share a little bit of my own story, for posterity's sake.

I am currently in a five-year-old relationship( no marriage, no children )that averages sex once per month.  Kissing is generally limited to brief pecks on the lips, and any attempts for deeper kisses results in her turning away or pushing me away.  Same with attempts to caress her body, offers of cunnilingus, or really any attempts of physical intimacy whatsoever.  On the extremely rare occurrences that she permits me to go down on her, she has to cover her face with a pillow so she can ""concentrate"", and I usually have to agree to a ""no sex guarantee"" such that I don't attempt intercourse when she is finished.  I am 32 years old, and she is 30.

When we first began seeing one another, she put on a fantastic show of pretending to think I was attractive and sexually desirable.  As it started out, she was at the very least receptive and acted like she was into making out, caressing, showering together, fondling, oral, and penetration in numerous ways, positions, and degrees of intensity.  This lasted about three months, after which it began to peter out to its current level after about a year, and has remained ever since.

I have been able to comprehensively rule out birth control, hormonal imbalances, medical conditions, house orderliness, asexuality, and passivity as possible causes.  What I am left with is a 95% certainty that she doesn't, nor has she ever, found me to be sexually appealing.  I have not gained fat during the course of our relationship, and I have been fairly good about keeping myself in shape.  I earn a good living, and take care of her the best I can.  I don't have any strange fetishes or sexual demands that one would expect her to be put off by.  

Typically, when I confront her about the topic, she doesn't really want to discuss it.  She will make some statement along the lines of ""I just don't get turned on like you do"", and leave it at that.

Things were fantastic when we lived in apartments, it seems like when we bought a house, things fell apart in the bedroom. It actually seems like she is a different person now, than a year ago.

She tells me she has no interest in sex, that she isn't even able to get excited by herself. She blamed it initially on being tired. I work an off shift and she used to stay up to talk with me, at my urging, she now goes to bed at a ""normal"" time. She has now gone off birth control, as she really wants kids. She has told me she is unhappy with her body and has been taking steps to slim down. I've been losing weight as well. I'm struggling with stopping smoking. I smoked when we got together, she wasn't happy about it, but understood. (ATM, I'm really struggling with regards to quitting.) The last time we had sex, we had gone out with a group of friends drinking. When we got back home, we fought about sex. She got really upset, then she came and took control, it was fantastic. That was about 4 months ago.

I feel ignored in this aspect. I bring it up and she gets frustrated, saying that she can't help it. I feel she worries more about fixing up the house than being with me. I do all the projects that she wants, figuring if she is happy with the results, she will be more interested in me. I retreat to the xbox when she shows no sign of wanting me around. When we go out with people, it is like we put on a show, acting like things are ok. Inside, I'm pissed, angry, hurt, alone, depressed.

I was married once before when I was 21, that lasted a year. Ended due to differences in religion, money, career, basically being too young, etc.

I stumbled into this sub on Monday and have lurked all week, and it kills me to learn how many people out there are going through this same crap. 

Married with kids. We were sex fiends in college and after graduation until we got pregnant. Had our first and our sex lives continued basically back to normal save for the sleepless nights here and there. 

After our third was born, a year and a half ago, I can count the number of times we've ""had sex"" since on one hand. In quotes because they've all pretty much been mechanical, quick, and had absolutely no passion whatsoever. There's zero intimacy between us anymore. 

I've always given her back rubs or ""scratched her scalp,"" rarely with expectation of sex afterwards; sex was something that was usually a separate event later on in the night or in the morning. She's never really reciprocated, and could always come up with an excuse when I'd flat out ask...but it hasn't really come to really hit me until the sex was gone too. She'll hardly even spoon anymore during movies. We might as well be in separate beds the way she rolls away from me at night. Ice cold. 

I don't really know what came over me last weekend but I suddenly had the urge to avoid the cold bed so after the kids were in bed and she was reading in ours, I went downstairs and set up camp on the couch. Not a question was asked about it. Like nothing was out of the ordinary. 

I haven't brought it up yet. I have a pretty good idea of how it would go down if/when I do, but I just need to get something a bit more hashed out in my head before I really address it. As it is with the majority of the threads in here, it's not just about the sex, it's the intimacy I miss...I need.

Been together close to 4 years, come March.  We don't live together, never have.  But we see each other daily, are together most of our free time, and we love each other dearly.  I am in love with him, and he is with me.  Every thing else is pretty great.  

Let's put it on the table first. I am not an unattractive girl.  I am quite an attractive, petite, skinny Asian girl.  I put makeup on, I do my hair, I wear nice clothes, I am very clean and I shave EVERY FRICKIN DAY.  In other words, I am very well-kept, and never ever did I let myself go.  I gained maybe 5-8 lbs, since we've started dating (say, from a measly 90 lbs - 98 lbs at my highest point).  He gained maybe 5 lbs since we've met? No biggie. We're both very good looking still, and I have the hots of him ALL THE TIME.  Obviously, I'm the one with the higher libido.

However, we have a dead bedroom.  We have plenty of time to ourselves, and I stay over at his house one-two nights per week, and we have lots of alone time privately together, so that's no problem there.  

At the beginning of our relationship, things were great! The sex happened 2-3X per week for the first couple of months! That made me very happy, and kept me very satisfied.  Fast forward to now,we do it maybe once a month.  Then, once every 6-8 weeks.  I initiate sex 100% of the time, and he REJECTS it 99.9% of the time.  I've heard EVERY EXCUSE in the book (and beyond it)...""I'm too tired.""  ""Maybe tmr.""  (tmr never comes).  ""Next week.""  ""I don't want to""  ""I have a headache""  ""Stomach ache""   ""Let's just cuddle""   ""Why do you always want sex???""   ""Why are you such a horny persoN?""

WOW, he made me feel like a pervert all these years.  I tried lingerie! I tried being naked! ""Put some clothes on, babe""  ""Aren't you COLD?"" (mind you, it was the middle of the summer).  I tried heavy petting, making out, TALKING IT OUT WITH HIM.  He'd just get defensive.  He works f/t I understand his job is physically and mentally draining.  However, we used to do it!  I get so horny around him and sexually frustrated when he says no.  Then I start feeling unwanted, undesired and just plain ugly.  I am NOT UGLY.  I am NOT GROSS. I am an adequately attractive female.  and my boyfriend doesn't want me.

He avoids the topic when I DO try to get him to open up about sex.  He just changes the topic.  He rolls over and falls asleep, sometimes he would tell me ahead of time ""I don't feel like doing it tonight..no sex tonight.  I've got a headache....""  like he's warning me ahead of time there'd be no action for me!!  Okay! What do I do? I just start hating myself.  

Then, after pursuing him for the 100th time, he'd give me PITY SEX.  Like the ""Oh kay! Fine I'll give u sex to shut you up"" type of sex.  He makes me come, but in the back of my head it makes me think WHEN WILL I EVER GET SEX AGAIN? Will I be under a dry spell again?? How LONG?

HOWEVER, this past weekend, something MAGICAL HAPPENED!  We had SEX, ....Three times! We couldn't seem to get enough of each other.  However, after the third time early yesterday morning, he told me he has soreness in his testes, and that he was too tired for sex (again).  I guess the 3 sessions of sex in a span of 48 hours nearly gave his penis and testicles a crazy workout!

I KNEW this wouldn't last long! He just denied sex again tonight!! Well, we'll see how long this lasts.  I am always ready to go, but he just ughh...oh well =(

We've been living together for one. I'm 26 f and he's 29. We plan on getting married somewhere down the line.

I love him more then anything in the world but our sex drives just do not match. I'm high and he is low.
It started about 9 months into our relationship. It went from sex everyday we seen each other, to sex twice on the weekends, to sex maybe once a week if I'm lucky.

It didn't start to bother me until we moved in together. I worked a lot 52 hrs plus school. I started to notice he was downloading thousands of porno pics of women when I wasn't home. He was down to  masturbate everyday but couldn't manage sex with me at least once with me.

 I got real mad and can say I didn't deal with in an emotionally approaite way. I would cry and hold it in. When we'd drink together it would come out in terrible fights. He stopped watching porn(I have no problem with it if you still want to have sex with your partner) who knows how much he masturbates.

Now it's nine months down the road. After many conversations turned into fights. It comes down to him just telling me sex isn't important to him. Hed say to me ""You want to have sex more then once a week?"", to his body just can't do it and many other things.

I feel like I can't bring it up anymore without it causing a terrible fight and pushing him away. I'm constantly sexually frustrated. Our relationship is perfect in any other way. Hes super loving and cuddly. I love him more then anything in the world.

It seems to me that if I want to stay with him Im stuck with having sex once a week or less. Who knows how it will be when we get older. I don't know what's wrong with us, me or him. I feel like I'm going crazy and don't want our relationship to fall apart over sex.

I didn't know there were so many other women out there who feel like I do about their sex life (or lack thereof).

DAE ever find it difficult to fully enjoy sex when you DO get it, because you're so concerned thinking about how you're probably not going to get it for a long time after this? My partner even says things after we finish like, ""That should hold you off for another month"" or ""I better not hear you bitching about sex for another month"" and he says he's joking, but I know there is a kernel of truth to every joke. I know it's not healthy behaviour to only look to the future all the time, but this isn't really how I am in everyday life. I know I should live in the moment, especially while doing something I enjoy immensely, but I feel like if I let myself fully go to enjoy the experience I'll miss it that much more when he lets me down. Again.

We're only 23 and 27. I feel that he's way too young to never be interested in sex as he claims. I feel it's important to mention that we both have HPV (neither of us is sure who the transmitter was) and he still has genital warts. I told him it doesn't matter to me, but in a way it feels like just another excuse. It's either that he's too tired, he's not in the mood, he can't be turned on and off like a switch, you're either horny or you're not, I don't feel sexy because of my HPV, I am busy (probably playing a PC game), I don't feel like it right now, or simply just 'no'.

I feel like I'm ranting. I want to go through the entire history of our relationship as much as I want to just make this a short post. I'm just so frustrated. I'm tired of trying to have a conversation with him about what the problem is, when he simply refuses to tell me and gets more and more angry and says it's not a good time, which it never is.

I have a boyfriend, we'll call him Kevin. We've been dating for two plus years and he is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. I'm 25 and he's 26. Everything is perfect about him. He's smart, responsible, funny, gorgeous, and he treats me perfectly. There is only one problem: We don't have sex. Ever.

His past relationships weren't the most healthy, and he struggles with depression and an anxiety order--although they are mostly kept in check due to medications. I think these medications effect his sex drive and his... member. I'm a very sexual person and I know this for a fact, but I've kept that side in check because he feels like I smother him or it sometimes make him feel inadvertantly pressured into doing something he doesn't ""want"" to do. (When I'm feeling flirty and naughty and he couldn't care less). Because of this, I rarely, if ever, intigate anything. Because of THAT, he's never flirty with me. He never just pins me to a couch and makes out with me, sends me a dirty message... I feel like I get no sexual acknowledgement whatsoever. We do have sex, it's very infrequent and it's good but not great. We've talked about it several times and it always ends up hurting him and I HATE hurting him. Nothing ever changes.

Flash forward to now.

This guy, we'll call him Mike, and I have been hanging out. He's 20 (I know, I know. Pedo-bear). We have a lot in common and I always thought he was cute and we had fun hanging out. We would flirt innocently enough and it was all tame and great. One day, I'm over in his dorm room, we are drinking and play video games and we go to have tipsy cuddles. He ends up kissing me and DAMN that boy knows things a 20 year old should not know. Mike ends up saying that he does have a teensy bit of feelings for me but he wants to keep this strictly a FWB situation because he's always jumped from relationship to relationship and he's going through some major life changes and doesn't want a relationship. I'm thinking, this is awful but fantastic... oh shit. So at the time I just say ""sure"" 'caue I wanted him to keep kissing me.

We meet up a few more times over the days and we eventually go to a party and we're drinking, having a good time and he sends me a text saying ""I just want to fuck you"". He had never said that before. We end up sexting ALL night and we just stare hungrily at each other to the point where a friend of ours texts him saying ""what is going ON with you two?""

We arrange to meet up on Sunday to have sex. Again, I know this is very wrong. I do end up going over and we end up having sex. It's absolutely mind-blowing and incredible. I have never, ever felt that desired or wanted or sexy before. After we had sex twice, he got a little weird. The next day I get him to talk about it and he says that since things happened so fast he needed a day to ""process"" what happened. I eventually bluntly asked him ""Do you have feelings for me?"" After a few minutes he responded with ""I think I might if we keep hanging out a lot."" Flattered, and with butterflies in my stomach, I let him be.

He was weird for a few days but today he was back to normal and we hooked up again. This time, though, instead of hanging out after he said he had things to do (which he really did) and just dropped me off after.

I know what I'm doing/did is wrong and I feel like shit about it. The problem is, I now have feelings for Mike. We get along great and he's gorgeous and so much fun to hang out with, but he's a little bit more of a ""bad-boy"". (that may be because he's 20). He's super sensitive, and really sweet, funny, but he's not the type of person I THINK, as of right now, I would want to end up with. He's a little too irresponsible. Kevin, on the other hand, has everything Mike DOESN'T have. I DO really love Kevin more than life, even though I did these awful things.

I feel so bad about everything.

All that being said, I just don't know what to do about anything. I don't know how to read Mike's emotions or signal, I don't even know how to read my own.

I was a late bloomer. Came into my own much later in life, discovering that I could be funny, charming, and attractive. By the time I was introduced to the woman who would become my wife, I had only had 2 prior partners: My highschool girlfriend, and an ill-advised hookup with a crush rebounding off her recent ex. When my wife and I first got together, I swear to you we could have fuck-powered a small town's electrical needs for a month. 

And as is often the case, there was a decline - I know for some folks, it's gradual, and some it's steep. And mine was the latter. She had body image issues, as she had started to put on a lot of weight. I too had suffered from them, and there was a point where we both went crazy with diets and exercise. We both were turning heads, getting flirty looks at nightclubs, friends who were drunk crossing the line with if-your-significant-other-wasn't-here statements. 

And our sex life was still painfully anemic. Less, even. I couldn't understand... if I could get a phone number from the cute waitress at the diner, totally unprompted, how was it that I was so unfuckable to my wife? At the height of feeling like somehow everything just had to change, because maybe if I just worked out a little bit harder or lost a bit more weight, I might be attractive to her again... I proposed, and she said yes. 

I was (and am) nuts about her. But I started starving myself to the point where my body freaked out, assumed I was starving (which, in a way, it was), and flooded my brain with ""GO EAT NOW"" signals. And I gained all the weight back, and some extra to boot. And only in a matter of a few months. Eventually, we both came to understand that healthy is not a number on a scale or a size on a garment, and we started to accept ourselves and take care of our bodies instead of going to war with them. 

All during this time, I was sexually miserable. I worked very hard not to pressure her, because I know that guilt is more efficient than a bucket of cold water at extinguising sexual desire. I would have conversations with her that were positive, where I'd make lots of ""I"" statements, and tried to make a space where she could talk. 

And she just. Would. Not. Do. It. The times we did have sex, were rushed and frantic and awkward. I'd be torn between releasing pent up sex, and thinking ""Maybe if I was just better at going down on her"" or ""Maybe if I fuck her like *this*"". 

Eventually, I got so starved for attention, I had two near-physical affairs (and in retrospect, they were emotional). I was so tired of her being possessive and affectionate when we'd be out at a club, but would instantly plug into her laptop when we got home. I called off the wedding. We went to couples counseling. We felt like we were having breakthroughs, and the wedding was back on, and we got married. 

A few years later, she became so seemingly short tempered with everyone and everything, that we started fighting, and I asked for a divorce. We almost went through with it, and after one last big blowout where I went through how much she was hurting me and how I felt I had no other choice (because she was hurting me more than I could love her), she finally got it. We reconciled, and our lives went on. 

Things have gotten very incrementally better. We're more comfortable with our bodies, so we're a bit more comfortable asking for what we want. We're surrounded by sex-positive friends... some are adult performers, some are escorts, some are sex educators... we are litterally, at this point in our lives, in a sea of sex positive and body positive friends, information, and imagery. But against this backdrop, and as we hit middle age, I realize how patiently I've been waiting for things to get better. Every 3-6 months, we have a talk. I'm super-positive, not-accusatory, talk about my needs and fantasies, and while it's led towards the best sex we've ever had when we DO have sex, it's still infrequent, and she ducks any fantasies I have (which are incredibly super vanilla wear this piece of lingerie style fantasies... not ""here, get fucked by this midget in a horse costume while I piss on him and yodel"" kind of a thing). And the sex is something I can set my watch to. Once every 2 weeks (excluding shark week), on a Saturday or Sunday, like it's getting chores out of the way. 

It's good sex. Fuck, it's great sex, the kind where the neighbors can't look us in the eye for a day afterwards. But, I'm starting to freak out again. She knows it. I've banked my libido for well over a decade, trying to get things to a place that works. I've tried asking her to start from zero, relearning everything that turns us both on, to show each other how we masturbate, to me asking her how she wants sex initiated and what turns her on. Flirting during the day. Asking her to try the mojoupgrade quiz. 

I get shrugs and no answers, other than she's tired during the week.  And then she tells me that she's committed to a major athletic event, which will have her doing MORE training and be even more exhausted. She didn't ask, she just told me. 

I'm sitting here today, mourning the death of the sex life I always wanted. I can't leave... that is not an option, and there's no one else I want to fuck anyways anymore. The only time I'm masturbating over someone else is if I'm watching porn. If I'm fantasizing, it's always her. 

So I'm sitting here, wondering if I should just give up so I can stop having my hope and desires crushed, or roll the dice again and have drawn out disappointment. I think that I'm finally to the point of just surrendering.

My wife (32F) is very attractive, but has never had any type of sex drive without having to be reminded. When we first started dated we were both young and it took us a very long time (a few years) to have sex for the first time. I chalked that up to me being her first boyfriend. I guess that should have been a giveaway of what was in store, but we are both fairly committed people and dated for over 6 years before getting married 6 years ago. The marriage has been great outside of this dead bedroom. We have sex maybe 2-3 times a month. We both trust each other and have been openly communicating. We’ve had countless discussions about how I don’t feel fulfilled in the bedroom. Usually there is an increase in sex (maybe 2 times that week) and then it goes back to the same no sex situation. Then we have another discussion about 3 months later. Rinse and repeat. I used to get angry and we’d get into fights over this, but I think I am now just resigned to the fact that this is my life. I get very upset and almost depressed about thinking about what my life could have been like if I had married someone else. She does seem genuinely interested in trying to fix the problem (not necessarily want to increase her libido, but just have more sex to stop the conversations). I see her make a conscious effort the week after we have our sex conversations, but it seems that sex is so outside of her normal train of thought that being intimate with me is so easily forgotten. I am the type of person that doesn’t want her to have sex with me because I tell her, but being with her for so long, I know that is the only reason she tries. What’s really fucked up is that it has gotten to the point that I am no longer even interested in having sex with her. I prefer to jerk off to a porno and get my fix this way. Going through the motions with her is just not enjoyable. I know she has no sexual desire and I just don’t want to put her or myself through the charade anymore. I am not sure if I’m looking for advice or just a way to let this off my chest. It just sucks that she is perfect in almost every way, but I am so unhappy in this marriage because of this one thing.

After a discussion several months ago, my wife told me that she can't ""give myself to you when I don't feel like we have any emotional connection"". I told her that it, in that case, I wouldn't pressure her and it would be up to her to initiate when se wanted. So, I've stopped initiating sex. I've been tracking incidents of sexual contact between my wife and myself for a few years now. This morning my wife asked if I'd like to fool around tonight. Our last encounter was seven weeks ago. The one before that was 15 weeks prior (seems like she skipped one in the middle). Since the beginning of 2010, we've had sex a grand total of 16 times, three times this year, and five times in the past 12 months. 

This is crippling to my self-image, and I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. It use to be the case that after sex I'd feel much closer to her, but now I don't get anything like that glow-y connection sex used to bring. 

For the record, we're both late-30s, have been together for 20 years, and are each others' first and only (to the best of my knowledge) sexual partners (not religious - just because we met and got together very young). We've been to months of couples counselling, and I've been going to counselling on my own. I've working on improving myself, and have been getting a fair amount of attention from women I've met through work and mutual acquaintances. This feels like being fed through the proverbial drip tube.

My SO and I have been together for almost 6 yrs. Me (M29 HL) Her (27 LL). Like most relationships it started out great in the bedroom. I used to go and visit her before we were living together and she wouldn't let me leave without some sort of sexy time. This was going great for about a year then it started becoming less frequent, which is to be expected i spose.

After a year or so sex became a fair bit less frequent and I just assumed this was because she still lived with her parents and as her room was right next to theirs it was a bit awkward (mind you it didnt seem to be an issue when we started seeing each other. Oh well).

Eventually about 3 and a half years ago we decided to get our own place and I thought ""Great, she wont feel awkward about being around her parents, bring on the sexy times again! Wrong.

We have now lived together for nearly 3 years and I would say that we have sex or anything remotely intimate maybe once every 2-3 months. Which really sucks. 

We have spoken about it and she tells me that she ""doesnt need to have sex and that she doesnt ever feel like it"". So now whenever I try and initiate anything remotely intimate (kisses or hugs even for an extended period) she is quite unresponsive and I get the distinct impression that she thinks that I am pressuring her. I dont know, maybe sometimes I can be but if I am I would say its out of frustration more than anything.

The few times we have had sex in the last few months has only been because we have been out and she is a little bit tipsy so her inhibitions are a little more relaxed. That frustrates me too. 

She has gained some weight in the time we have been together and I think that might be part of the reason for her LL. Not feeling as sexy and whatnot. I understand that. I think she's beautiful as she is and I tell her that all the time but I guess the self confidence is probably not there. 

Im probably not the most romantic guy ever. I try to be, but that doesnt seem to work either. Not that ""just because i do something romantic we should have sex"". But there have been occasions where we have had whole weekends away to celebrate anniversaries or birthdays or whatever and I would say the ""conditions were perfect"" but still nothing.

I dont know man :( 

Sorry for the rant. Its late, im tired and frustrated. I should go to bed

I'm happy for every advice since I don't know what to do anymore.
I'm trying to make this post as short as possible, so here are some key facts:
- In a relationship for 11 months (shes 23)
- we're living together
- I want sex, she does not
- bedroom is dead for about 2 1/2 months now
- relationship is awesome, except for no sex

Like in almost every post around here, at the beginning of our relationship the sex was frequent and good. Then a few months ago my girlfriend lost her job. She was really depressed and I guess because of that she was not in the mood for sex anymore (although we had sex every now and then because we were only together a few months at that time). We've had a lot of conversations about why we're not having that much sex anymore and she always said it's because of her current situation. 

Now 2,5 months ago, her life got back to normal. She got a new job and everything seems to be fine now. I of course noticed that she felt better and started to try to bring back sex. I tried to be romantic, I tried massages, I tried everything but it did not work. It was not that she just blocked me, after a few tries she even got really pissed that me. Again we talked and talked and she said that I'm pushing to hard and that I need to wait for her to make the move. I really tried that as good as I could but nothing changed. 

Now last week she went on a vacation with her family (I wanted to come with her but unfortunately I had to work), so we did not see each other for a while.I hoped that the distance would help to rearrange our sexlife, but it did not. She came back, we had a wonderful day, kissed talked had fun but as soon as I tried to go into the sex-direction everything was back to how it was before. The slight difference was that I noticed that at first she also wanted to have sex with me but then it seemed like somethin came to her mind and she immediately blocked me again.

I know that I seem to be the major part of the problem, because I push to hard. But I just can't help myself. I feel rejected, I'm losing my self-confidence and also everytime I see her walking around naked I start to get really angry on the inside because I'm so attracted to her.. I even thought about buying myself a prostitute to blow of some steam so that I can give her some space but I'm not that kind of guy. Also I'm way too much in love with her..

I should start off by saying that in almost every other aspect in our lives we do pretty well, except the bedroom.

When we first started dating, we had sex a lot - sometimes several times a day. Course that settled down, which I know happens over time. Them the baby came, which of course put a damper on the bedroom but I was okay with that. Things really took a nosedive over the past few years however.

We were in a situation these last 3 years where I had to live out of town during the week. It's over now, but it has caused some serious stress and damage to our relationship. In the first year, I discovered she was having an online relationship with someone in a virtual world. Talking over the phone, cybersex over Skype, everything short of meeting in person. We somehow worked through it, and I hoped that when I could be back home things would be better. They are to some extent, but not to where it should be.

We probably have sex maybe once or twice a month now.  I've always had the higher libido, but I feel like my wife struggles with several issues that kills her libido. Depression, anxiety, and a stressful professional job. She's never been a touchy, affectionate type. Some of this I feel is partially due to issues caused by her father leaving her and her mother to start a family with his mistress. She won't cuddle, hardly kisses me and will never initiate sex the rare times we have it.

I feel like I'm at a breaking point now. I would never cheat on my wife, but I find myself constantly fantasizing about other women. I masturbate almost every day out of pure frustration.  I almost resent the affection she shows our daughter, which I know is different but shows she is capable of showing affection to loved ones. Sometimes I cry when I'm alone, just wishing she would just at least hold me, leave a note, just something. I've tried being more romantic, but she hardly appreciates or responds to anything I do.

Sorry for this wall of text, I just needed to pour my heart out. I don't know what to do now. I don't want to leave, but I can't keep going on like this. Shes about to drop to part time which may help with the stress, but she's wanting to have another child, and I'm worried things will get even worse if we do. Please, any advice?

That he wanted me to know that there was nothing I did wrong, that the bad relationship had caused his libido to crash, and that the lack of sexual intimacy was only mental. He cited his current spike in libido as evidence that the bedroom only suffered because we were unhappy in the relationship.

I'm a 27 year old HLM living with my 26 year old LLF girlfriend of 2+ years. I love her and never tire of spending time with her. We have a perfect relationship, except when it comes to sex. 

We have sex 2-3 times per week. The issue is that she never wants sex. She tolerates it. I would gladly sacrifice frequency for passion, but she simply doesn't seem to have a sex drive. 

It's important to me that she be driven to have sex with me, at least sometimes. I feel like most of my enjoyment of sex comes from pleasing my partner. When my girlfriend's body language suggests that she'd rather be doing anything else, it hurts. I crave teasing her until she can't take it, or going down on her and feeling her legs shake. Her disinterest makes me feel like something vital is missing.

We go out dancing and drinking. She'll be all over me on the dance floor, but when we get home she'd rather just sleep. I'll cook for her and massage her on the couch, but tenderness doesn't do much for her. Obviously I enjoy these things for their own sakes, but I'd be lying if I said trying to get her in the mood wasn't among my motives. 

Her body language and attitude kill me. We'll start to get into it, and her face and body language communicate that what's about to happen is going to be awful for her and she wants me to know it. There's nothing horrible in her past, and it's not the body language of an abuse-survivor or anything---it's the body language of a bored, slightly annoyed adult. When I do stop, she gets mad. I find myself in situations now where I can tell she's really not into it, and I get this dreadful feeling that neither stopping nor continuing is right. 
 
Communication is not an issue. We discuss everything, including sex. She knows how I feel. Our conversations lead to her saying she understands this is an issue for me, and she wishes things were different. She wants to try harder. But sex just isn't important to her. There's a huge discrepancy between how much she says she wants to work on this and how much effort she actually puts into it. Intellectually, I understand that it's hard to put an effort into being into sex if you just aren't. 

Sometimes I think marriages evolve into deep friendships long after the passion is gone. Realistically, it's going to be hard to find a person I get along with as well as I get along with her. I try to convince myself I should just soldier on and focus on the more important parts of the relationship. I wonder if I'm being unreasonable. I've had a few serious relationships that have been much more sexually satisfying, but I never felt as good about those relationships as I do about this one. Still, I've been trying to make myself put less emphasis on these sexual problems for a long time, and I haven't had much luck.

I have been a long time lurker and finally have made an account just to post here. A little background:

I have been married for just short of 2 years, and we have been together since 2007. My wife (LL) and I met in undergrad, and fell hard almost immediately. She had previous sexual experience from a previous BF and I was still a virgin. However, she and I had very different skill sets. I was one of the early bloomers who had received a lot of awkward hand jobs and blow jobs during high school into college. She had, however, been one of those girls who skipped from kissing to sex (Brief musical interlude: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqG0rc7vZX4 ) She literally showed me this video to explain the situation. 

Needless to say, she was completely unskilled at giving or receiving manual or oral sex. These two items were my go-to moves, and when I met her, she seemed receptive to learn more. Things went downhill from there...

Around the 1 year mark, she started taking antidepressants to deal with some anxiety, and it started to affect our sexy times. She began to feel less and less arousal and her orgasms became more and more elusive. I went to the bullpen to bring in oral and manual to help out, but she felt uncomfortable with the whole situation. And so it just about stopped. She became so increasingly frustrated that she wanted nothing to do with me sexually. I understood that the meds were messing with her, and that I should be patient. 

Graduation, engagement, marriage, and an eventual move to a different state followed in typical order. I gave up a fruitful job prospect to put her through grad school, and we both moved 400 miles from the nearest family. I became increasingly depressed, frustrated, and lonely. I gave up everything, for her, and and working my ass off for no affection, no attention, and no appreciation. I dug in, advanced, climbed the ladder, and I snagged a great cushiony regional job with a corporate entity. I am, in my limited field, kind of a big deal. But I was dying inside from the lack of affection.

Our routine included coming home, I would make dinner, and she would handle her homework the household accounting. I took care of the housework, cleaning, cooking, and laundry while she focused on school and the careful metering out of the money that I brought home from work. We would watch TV, I would work on the computer, and pour myself a glass of whiskey before bed. She was completely unreceptive to anything and every advance. It was hell.

Here is her side: She felt unattractive due to some weight gain, and the lack of sensation made the whole business of sex awful. She couldn't come, and felt no interest in seeing me attempt to interest her. Her lack of experience in oral and manual became a hindrance to anything happening. She came off her meds and she basically had to relearn how to become sexual again.

My side: I was/am, as a mid twenties male, in my absolute peak of testosterone, on top of my profession, and feeling like my wife, my love, and I should enjoy each other. I will admit that at this point, I seriously considered exploring an extramarital affair. I was working so hard to make her happy, but without any reciprocal affection, I felt so used. 

Finally, after discovering this reddit, and reading the advice posted, I decided that I would lay the whole thing out for her, and give her the option to leave, allow me to have an open marriage, or to work through the issue to overcome what we both considered a difficult problem. She chose the latter option, and we have been working to better our relationship. Once we aired all of our insecurities and issues with ourselves, we offered our honest assessments of each other. I was an oversexualized male who drank and worked too much, and she was a frigid, unapproachable bitch who had no sense of what her man needed. These discussions were not pleasant, and we had a lot of nights spent on couches. It took about 6 months before we saw any real progress.

Here is the key: We talked it through. We were honest, but not hurtful, willing to hear what the other offered without judgement. These discussions about what we each wanted and expected sexually from each other were awkward and painful, but necessary. You just need to understand what may be holding your own self back, and be honest about your partner about how this effects you. 

We continue to work on the issue, but my sex life has taken a 180. From once per 4 months to 3 times a week. Not only that, but she has even begun to explore some more adventurous ideas in the bedroom.

TLDR: Tear down your walls, open up, and make your standards known. If you feel like you are not getting what you need to be happy, make your partner aware of it. If they want to make it work, they will.

Nothing good came from it - he read between the lines and found some stuff that doesn't even exist, things such as I think he sucks in bed and I'd rather not have sex? Now if you read that post, nowhere do I say that. It could be implied if I had not left the reasons why I said I would rather not have sex... but I explained it pretty well, or thought I did. I don't really beat around the bush - I will tell you exactly what's on my mind, even if it's not very nice. I don't like people putting words in my mouth.

Anyway, this did not really open up any doors of discussion between us. Again he said ""We should have more sex"" and again, I agreed. That was about the length of it.

Sex has actually dwindled down to about once every 2-3 months. He's gone down on me once. I'm actually starting to get angry that we don't fuck when I'm on my period, something that was ""meh"" to me before, but now I'm so frustrated that the extra rush of hormones just before and during my period make me an angry, horny woman. 

So... fast forward to this morning... I jumped on him as he was getting ready for work. He rolled over onto his stomach and I started giving him a massage and cracking his back, and I noticed he had some scratches on his shoulder area. Not a lot (two of them), not too big, but too big to be scratches from our kittens or our dogs... about fingernail sized...

I asked him about it and he laughed, said they were probably from the dog. Which it could be, but dog scratches are thinner and usually leave raised red marks, not wide bruised areas. I mean, I've scratched a few guy's backs in my days, I know what a clawed up back looks like...

I'm posting this on a burner account as wife is a redditor. 

Backstory is long but will keep it to the point. Wife and I have been together for 7 years. Found out she cheated on me with the same guy a couple of times over our marriage. We tried to make it work but it hurt me deeply so we separated and I moved out. 9 months later after much talking, we got back together.

Since then, things have been rocky to say the least. She told me she was having doubts about us but we talked it out and have stayed together.

The bigger issue being that she has always had a low libido and I have dealt with it in a understanding manner. Never pressured her when she says she is not in the mood.

Recently, we have experimented with toys and tried new things which have gone down well but our sex life has fallen back into the rut of the past.

I've bought it up several times that I do need some level of intimacy as I do have some trust issues (seeing a doctor about it) to keep me grounded and to reinforce that. She has responded that unless she feels in the mood, it just doesn't occur to her, even after several conversations where she promises to be more mindful.

I'm almost at wits end. I don't know what else to say or try. I've tried everything listed in many of the posts and this subreddit but have had no headway.

We've been together for six of those, and married for just about one. In the last six months, everything has started to go to hell.

When we first started dating, it was passionate. We fucked constantly, and we loved it. As time passed, things cooled down, which is normal for relationships, and we settled into a pattern of one to two encounters per week.

Lately (in the aforementioned past six months), things have dropped off even further. If I had things my way, we'd be having sex daily, but we're down to something like once per month at this point. Worse, I'm always the initiating party, and often feel like I'm being thrown a pity fuck to shut me up. It's emasculating and I feel neglected.

Of course, we've discussed the issue. On three separate occasions in the past six months, I've sat her down and told her about my feelings and misgivings. When we dig into it, we always end up discussing her body image and her job.

She's gained some weight in the past year; enough to hurt her self esteem, even though I still think she's sexy, and try to let her know on a regular basis. Her job is another tough spot. She hates it, and it isn't what she went to school to do, but her chosen field isn't hiring, and she's starting to come to terms with the fact that she may not get to do what she wanted to do with her life. In the mean time, she pays into the household expenses, but I am the primary earner.

I know that these things bother her, and contribute to her lack of a libido, but I still can't help but feel slighted by her unmitigated disinterest in all things sexy. I am a very sexual person; without the intimacy, I feel like we're just best friends but not lovers. It breaks my heart and hurts me dearly. Not to mention the fact that I get really down on myself when turning all of this over in my head.

It's gotten so bad that I've considered cheating on my wife just to relieve the frustration and give her some space to do what I know that she has to do. That's obviously not the best approach, but every time I bug her about sex, I feel as if I contribute to our problems. I'm happy to support her and help her get better, but there's only so much that a guy can do in a nearly sexless relationship.

The background is a bit complex so sorry if it's a bit jumbled. Me [21 M] and S.O. [21 F] have been dating on and off for about a year. When we first ""got together"" she was still struggling with some issues of her previous boyfriend, who has her first relationship and had a pretty deep commitment. She ended up cheating on him so that didn't really work out. During our on and off relationship she has not very committal (she was more or less talking to another guy as well but she denied it at the time). 

 
We took a break for awhile, during which I started talking to another girl. When she found out (we still talked) she suddenly decided she wanted to stay committed to me and no one else. After a lot of talking I decided to give her one more chance...she cut out the sketchiness with other guys but sex is still an issue. 

During our talks I've tried to be as open and honest as I could. I pointed out what bothers me, what my needs and wants are, available options for us, and compromises. We've had this talk countless times over the past year and each time either nothing changes or if there is more sex it's only for a week or two. I don't think my libido is terribly high- once every other day is my target while more than once a day everyday would be too much for me. She, on the other hand, would prefer 2-3 times a month. I realize I am the HL in this situation and she is the LL. She is on birth control but I could kind of tell she was LL even before she started taking it. She claims her finances don't allow her to change birth control (which is OK as there are other possible reasons to help our situation). She is also not willing to go to counseling because of the cost and idea that she can handle it herself. 

During our talks I've heard almost everything that has been posted here, from ""I don't understand why sex is so important to you"" to ""There are other ways to show you I love you other than sex"". My explanations have been that sex and intimacy are important to a romantic relationship. It is something that makes me happy and feel loved. For awhile she said she'd change and work on it but lately, after I point blanked asked her if sex was something she would compromise for, she has said no. Sex is not something she will compromise for and if she doesn't want to have sex or be intimate then that's that. Anytime it's ""for me"" she says it feels faked and that makes her hate it more. 

The general consensus on DB is to probably cut my losses, move on and find someone more compatible. But as many know (and some that don't) it's easy to give that advice but hard to take it. I really like her and I want this to work out but I don't know if I can handle this. I've tried to frame this as factual and non-biased as I could, but I'm sure this post puts her in a negative light so please keep that in mind

So my question is, should I move on? If so, what will help the process and if not, what are the next steps? Feel free to inquire about any other details. 

Tl;dr: Had talks with SO many times, she's not willing to change. What next?

First post in this subreddit. I've been posting in /r/nofap and /r/sex to see if I can change  what's happening to me and my relationship, this SR seems to be somewhere I might find solace too. A bit of background, I'm 26m and she is 25f - after the honeymoon period of about 8 months the sex started dropping off. For the last two years I have been having sex with her but only because I know it's like denying her water or food - she has a bodily need for it. It's been maybe once a month but I don't enjoy it, I have to force myself to cum and it's really quite upsetting, though I always try to make sure she has fun and when I put the effort in I know she enjoys it in ways she can't fake. This is no fault of hers, she is young, happygolucky and attractive - but I just never look at her and think ""wow I really want to taste that!"" I hate the fact that it's mechanical and not genuine for me, I feel I'm cheating her. I'm defintely NOT asexual or anything like that - just to be clear :).

I'm really trying hard to stick to a nofap reboot and I'm a week in. No changes yet but it takes time.

It would really help me to know if anyone else has had any success with this type of scenario - I really want to want her, and to enjoy sex as much as it sounds like pretty much everyone in sexxit seems to in fact I'm going to stop browsing there because I find it depressing and feel left out - there are people ther organising threesomes and fantasies and there's me just trying to figure out how to enjoy basic-getting-laid-101. I don't feel truly alive sometimes because I've never reached particularly dizzying heights of pleasure with anyone - I feel broken :(. Everything that guys seem to go on about beig heaven like HJ's and BJ's do absolutely nothing for me and never have.

I've been fapping daily since 18 and lost my virginity at 19, and I've only had one other sexual partner.

Other than the sex issues we are perfect together and have been for 5 years. Reddit; I want to marry this girl one day but I WILL NOT condemn her to a passionless life. I truly believe she would bear it for me for a long time, and wouldn't cheat - but everyone has a limit.

In the beginning our sex life was great. We fucked like bunnies. Every time we saw each other we'd find the time to get busy. Now I'm lucky if I get it once a month. It's been like this for months. I try to seduce him only to be rejected. He used to make me feel beautiful and now I feel like an old hag. 

It's not just our sex life that is suffering. It's everything. For a year he was jobless. I supported us both. I I've had to borrow money from people, and there were oftentimes that our fridge was empty. Then I became ill and had to stop working. He got a job, and now the opposite is happening. Except I get a check for disability and our fridge is always full. We have money to hang out and do things, but he never wants to leave the house on his days off. He sleeps all day instead. 

He doesn't spend any time with our daughter anymore. Just yesterday he was supposed to have some daddy/daughter time, and instead he slept. My daughter was devastated. I cried almost all day. 

But back to our bedroom life, or lack thereof. He makes up excuses. He tells me he is tired, too full, that my breath smells(?). He tells me I am beautiful once every six weeks or so. He's gained a lot of weight in the past year. I haven't. I still tell him all the time how handsome and sexy he is. 

When we do have sex, it's awkward. I've given up on trying to get him to do it. On the off chance he does initiate, it lasts all of three minutes until he finishes and I'm left hanging. I have never masturbated in my life. I don't want to start, but what other options do I have?

1366117615.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,1cgihc,Opinions on medical based DB’s?,18,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1cgihc/opinions_on_medical_based_dbs/,"Hi fellow DBers.


This is me just having a bit of a vent really. Taking the opportunity to tell my story even though I know there are only 3 options. It’s turned into a bit of a wall of text, but you don’t have to read it if you don’t want to.

 
My History.


I’m 56 years old, British and male. As normal, I feel I have a high libido. Y is 50 and a LL female.


I was originally married in 1979. X had been raped at 15 so I was not surprised that the sex was slow, but it was bearable especially knowing the back story. Eventually it fizzled out to once every few weeks where she would kneel up and say “Hurry up.” Sometimes she would try but she never came once in 22 years. However I loved her, and I still do. I so wish we could get back together but she has someone else now. We kissed passionately, hugged and touched. Neither of us wanted kids and both had average careers. I was a fireman and she a secretary.


I met Y. She was married also and we were friends for a couple of years before I touched her. I was surprised when I wasn’t rejected and we had sex a few times. We were not ‘in love’ and it was never meant as ‘an affair’, it was just intimacy for us both. I knew she had had Lymphoma and chemotherapy and was told that she couldn’t have kids by the doctors. Her and her husband were childless and a couple of times we used no protection, being confidant with each others history.


Well, our son is now 11 and Y and I are both divorced and remarried together.


My current life.


Y is Low Libido. I discussed the fact that sex is important to me and she said that it would never be a problem. It was, but not as bad as some on here. Weekly I guess, and sometimes she would even come. (Yeah, sad that it was so rare but more than X.) 


So, now the medical DB. Y stresses easily and she developed Ulcerative Colitis about 5 years ago. She may have been hiding symptoms from me but the onset of anal bleeding was sudden and she went into hospital. They did emergency surgery to save her life which involved removing her entire large intestine, and it took more than a year for the physical scars to heal.


They are still vivid though, from chest to pubes in bright red traintracks, but it’s the mental scars that are the real issue. She has an ileostomy bag on her and she hates everything to do with it. She hates draining the bag, changing the bag, cleaning up when it leaks (often at 3 am when we have to change the bed), the smell. She hates her body, she hates the doctors for giving her this bag, she hates the ‘plug’ that builds up in the remains of her arse, she hates me for calling the ambulance… 


I have spoken to her doctor about counselling but unless Y chooses to go it cannot be forced on her. You guessed it, she refuses to go. “I don’t need councelling!”


And so to sex.


As I said she hates her body. I have managed to masturbate her a few times but the last time was more than 2 years ago now. She says that PinV hurts her but once every few weeks she will lie on her side and let me slip inside from the back, heavily lubed up, but I mustn’t touch the tits or anything else. She won’t touch me at all now. If I try to kiss her there’s always something that needs doing instead. If I hug her she freezes then pulls away. If I try to talk to her all I get is “You only want me for sex!”. But she sleeps naked next to me every night! All I have to do is reach over and there she is, but No means NO! and I have to respect that.


I’ve asked her to ‘help’ me, just by sitting next to me and holding me if I have a wank. Maybe I could cup her breasts. No! Would she consider stroking my cock, just once a week? NO, you’re sex mad! Anything at all? I SAID NO!!!


My libido is reducing now. Yes, I’m heading to 60 years old soon so I guess that accounts for some of it, but I really think it’s just been killed. It’s been trampled on by two wives who both promised the earth and failed to deliver, by me for taking it to heart and by the world because there have been no more than three other short relationships in my life. But I still mentally undress almost every woman I see. I still want to be held by, someone.


I don’t want to leave because:


1. It most ways, it’s not her fault. She didn’t choose to have the illness, but she has chosen to not look at our relationship from my side sometimes.


2. Y doesn’t / can’t work and has no income, I am her financial support. 


3. Son needs stability.


4. At my age I’m scared of being alone. I didn’t know it until just now, but I think I am.


I tried a prostitute but it was no better than having a wank. There was no comfort in it, no hugs, no real human connection and there’s the worry of disease. And it takes a chunk out of the wages.


I’m in the middle of the south coast of the UK if any older ladies would like some company! :)

His feelings about sex in relationships is so confusing. In our one way conversations, because I have to force him to talk, he has thrown out things like "" I think its weird that people want to have sex more than once a week"" and other things that make me uncomfortable to even initiate anymore.

Tonight I think was the last straw. We were taking a shower and about to have relations and I wanted to move it up stairs. I said something sexy, hopped out of the shower and expected to him to follow. He did but he was fully clothed.

I snapped. He refused even to talk to me while i spilled my heart out. I suggest counseling so a third party could help sort it out. His response was ""I'm sick of talking about it the last two years and im done talking, ever again"" He said shut up about or we should split. This isnt liike him besides when it comes to talking about our sex life.

His back is hurt now but this has been going on before this. I get sex once a week or less and no other sexual anything. I suggested oral or any thing else and he scoffed and said that people didn't get off from that...wtf is all i can say about that.

I think he has deep rooted issues with sex. He looks at porn very often but has no drive for me. I'm sick.

This is my first post here and I don't have much to say. I just tried to initiate sex and got rejected. And he really had the nerve to say ""not today"". So I couldn't help myself and said ""more like never"". He sighed and made a face that told me that he is so annoyed that I come up with it again. I am just so sad and I feel ugly etc. 

We are having problems for a long time now, but since we moved in together a year ago it's just gotten worse; even though he promised that it will help our sex life. The last time we had sex was on the 24th Dec., my birthday. Before that it was sometime around september. In the past year it was 5x. So roughly every three months. Oh, and I tried so many things; from The Talk (more than once) to initiate very often, initiate never and leave it up to him, watching porn together, suggesting every sexual thing that exists and so forth. He just doesn't cooperate.

(Dead again) [Rant],15,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1bqc8s/i_guess_this_is_how_it_is_dead_again_rant/,"I have to come to grips with the fact that it is going to be a DB for me.  Porn and masturbation is going to be my future release and I have to come to accept that.

Some of you on here know me and have heard me rant before.  It seems like this is the only place where I can talk about this.  

Background-

Married 15 years and at the beginning we had a healthy bedroom (although there were hints of what was to come).  I would say that it was not uncommon for us to have sex 1-2 times a week in our first 2-3 years.  Now I am lucky if we have sex 1x a month and that is with me pressing for it.  I am tired of begging.  I constantly tell her how beautiful/sexy she is and I am getting tired of working so hard just to feel something in return.

Today-
This last week, we have been on somewhat of a vacation.  I was hoping that with the time off we would have the opportunity to reconnect etc. but that did not happen.  When heading to bed for the night, I did not feel like begging anymore and just purposely did not put in the effort.  I sense that she is ok with that and probably relieved.  One night I went to bed naked (something I rarely do that usually indicates my interest) and she just felt my thigh and laughed at the fact that I was naked and fell asleep.  

I guess that I am just here for company and ... well, I wanted more out of life.  I am tired of trying.  I want her to desire me, but that is not happening.  And I feel- Tired.  Sad.  Defeated.  Alone.

1365106407.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,1bompj,The issues go waaaay back between me (m44) and my wife (f45).,14,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1bompj/the_issues_go_waaaay_back_between_me_m44_and_my/,"Some of this is venting but some of it is looking for direction/advice. 

Part the problem I am about to reveal is my fault because the roots of it go waaaay back.  I have been in a relationship with my wife for 20+ years, married for over 15.

The sex has been infrequent since the birth of my first son over 15 years ago.  But at that point I was the one who resisted because I suspected she was trying to get pregnant again.  She always wanted a huge family but because she gave all of her attention to the first child and shut me out of a lot, I got cold feet.  

At that point I began drinking more.  Kept drinking more and more.  And at some point I became a critical dickhead and alcoholic.  

Since then we have had sex less than 20 times, twice resulting in more kids.  But the alcohol both contributed to the problem and helped me ignore it.  (Alcohol= the cause and the cure right?)  And, increasingly, I have felt isolated from her and resentful of her giving all of her attention to the kids. We haven’t had sex in 3 years.  Or more; I lost count.  I resent her for that too.

2 years ago I decided that I was not going to live my life as a depressed drunk.  I quit drinking and went to psychotherapy.  

The last time I directly addressed sex with her was around then.  She said, “maybe I should start sleeping in the bed again.”  But that didn’t happen.

There are very few opportunities to talk together, and when there are we are usually interrupted by the kids.  Or they eavesdrop.  Once we went for coffee and I told her that I was working on my issues but needed more adult companionship from her, and she told me I should “find a friend.”  

I’ve asked to go on dates but it rarely works out.  And I’ve kind of given up on bringing it up again, until now.  

Anyway, now I’m mostly happy; the only lingering issue is the sex and marriage.  

I gave up trying to display affection probably 8 months ago when she stepped out of the way and brushed my hands off of her.  She probably has body issues.  (Despite some hair issues (balding, grey) I am in very good shape.)
  
She sleeps in another room.  It started because she said I was snoring and she also didn’t like me surfing the web on the laptop in bed.  I took actions to correct both (stopped drinking and stopped using the laptop) but that did not bring her back to the bed.

A few weeks ago a very attractive chick hit on me in a bar.  I could have lied about my status when she asked, but I told the truth.  We got into a long discussion about my life and she concluded that either I must be having multiple affairs or I am living a sad existence.  The attractive chick was right.  My existence is sad - but I am not having affairs.  And that conversation really got me rattled.   

And this is why I am writing this, I am seriously considering having an affair.  I would like to give the marriage one more chance but I don't even know how/when to open the communication lines.  But I don't want things to go on like this much longer.  Life is too short.

tl;dr:  no sex in years, partially my fault but trying to rectify things, considering cheating, want to change

I'm looking for ideas on how to accomplish that besides ""masturbate more"".

----

I've been lurking this subbreddit for a while, I thought it was about time I start posting about this. I guess it won't be the last the post.

My (24M) gf (30F) has a very low libido, whereas I have a reasonably high one. I don't think I'm specially obsessed about sex, twice a week would work for me, but usually we do it either once every two weeks if the starts align, or otherwise once a month or every two months. 

She's my soulmate, we think alike, we are always on the same page, we complete each others sentences, we complement each other in many things... but... she is never horny. Never has dirty or kinky thoughts, never initiates anything, never masturbates, ... this has remained constant throughout the time, but regardless, we used to have sex more often the first year. But I realize this could be due to the whole ""libido goes high at the start of the relationship, then it goes back to normal once partner is secured"" so I'm not counting on seeing that back.

I have not had ""The Talk"" with her yet. But I've given hints here and there, I asked her whether there's anything she'd like to try, I suggested maybe I could try harder to please her, maybe I'm not doing enough... she hasn't shown interest for anything at all. I'm pretty sure she understands I'm concerned because even though I've never brought the issue as a dead serious problem, I've mentioned and talked about it enough times for her to realize that. She blames the enviroment, the place, the situation, work... but the more the time goes by the more I'm sure these are just excuses to avoid admitting the cold truth: that she has low libido and there's nothing I or she can do about it.

I don't think having ""The Talk"" or going to a therapist would help here in any case. I'd love for my SO to *want* to have sex more often, but can't press or force her to do something she doesn't want. That would be pointless and cruel. 

I have a growing cocktail of frustration, depression, anger and resentment... and I don't want this crap. It's just gonna make me unhappy and her unhappy. But I'm not ready to give up on her, she is the best I've ever had and I really enjoy spending time with her and talking to her. When I can forget the aforementioned cocktail for a while, that is.

So... I've come to the conclussion the best I can do for the moment is to tame my libido. If I lower my libido, I will feel less frustrated and I won't resent her. I'm open to change this decision in the future, I know I will have to revisit it before marrying, but this is what I want to do for the time being. 

What do you guys suggest? I'm growing specially concerned at the fact that masturbation just.. doesn't cut it anymore. Internet porn doesn't turn me on at all, I feel like I've seen it all, and the times where I do force myself to masturbate just to relieve myself I can orgasm and cum, but it doesn't feel satisfying, it doesn't really satiate me anymore. What are other things I could try? I really would prefer to stay away from antidepressants and any other drug in general by the way.

Thank you, really, for your time if you made this far. Looking forward for you thoughts, I'm sure I'm not the only one going through this.

So anyway, my wife and I have sex only once a month, when really I would want it at least once a week, preferably several times. We've been married 7 years, and over the years I just stopped initiating, being shut down 90% of the times. So i just wait for her to initiate, which is about once a month.

I have the strangest story I suppose. My wife and I have been together since the late nineties, and about two or three years in she suddenly went LL. We spent tons of time and effort with the help of doctors trying to find solutions. “normal” “nothing wrong” “Its your husband’s fault” “You should eat more greens” or some other quack bullshit from the doctors was always put forth. Her libido was literally non existent, no toys, or effort of time and patients would do anything at all. She would be confused and saddened by the resulting effects of not being turned on with me. I myself have the damnedest time having a good time with another human being if they aren’t turned on. If I don’t have that connection I’m turned off eventually and just going through the motions. I need a true partner into the whole deal with emotional connections and heated sexual desire as well. So this went on for, well, years as it turned out. 

Finally in 2012 she suddenly turned on again, with the opening of the relationship and boundaries being set. Of course this makes one think about things highly, and basically worries that your ability to turn her on is lacking. That went on for just under a year and then she turned off again like a light switch. Zero fun times, no ability to get her going and frustration again. I thought she had just “turned on” and I would be scott free again. Sadly no. 
Now I am faced with her not being able to be turned on but being sexually aroused by other men. It turns out that if someone is interested and there is chemistry she is turned on, but not once she gets home it seems. 


I do lovey stuff and spend time with her doing the sweet things she likes. I do the mushy things that everyone likes in a relationship and even do date nights out on the town and stuff. I put her needs first, and even communicate very well.

Sex with my wife of almost 23 years has been a slowly dying situation with any sex at all coming about once a month at best for the past few years.  I'm almost 45 and my wife will be 46 later this Fall.  My sex drive has not diminished at all since I was in my teens/20's and I don't see it even slowing down.  My wife's sex drive appears to be almost non-existent.  If any sex happens at all, it's only because I initiate it.  She acts like putting any effort into sex is more than she's willing to contribute (she just mostly lays there) and she seems to be content with me ""getting her off"" and then hurrying me along until I ""get mine"".  If I try to initiate more sex than I've been getting, she always replies ""You just got some a couple of days ago."" like I'm asking to borrow money or asking for a favor.  She actually told me a few years ago that she viewed sex as just another chore like doing the laundry or washing the dishes. . . This really pissed me off and I still hear those words ringing around in my mind ever time I think about initiating sex with her.  She has body image issues with her weight and went through lap band surgery about 3 years ago (she lost about 70 pounds and has since put the weight right back on).  I have gone through the trouble of going out of my way to let her know that I don't care about her weight (seriously!) and to let her know without a doubt that I feel that she is still attractive to me and that I still absolutely LOVE sex with her.  We've had ""The Talk"" and all I got back from her was crying and excuses about how she doesn't feel attractive and nothing changed.  About 4 years ago, she got in mind that someone else was interested in me and that I was going to leave her (the woman was a friend who actually showed some compassion for me when I had an injury and was asking how I was doing too much for her liking).  For about a month, sex was back where it was when we first got married (she was literally jumping me every night and she was actually making love to me rather than just laying there so I know she's still capable of being amorous when she wants to).  After the other person and I agreed to not have any contact with each other because it was going to wreck my marriage, she saw that there was nothing to the idea that I was leaving and everything went right back to where it was:  Nothingness.  

I've have now decided to start an experiment to see just what it would take to make her interested in sex with me again.  I've always been affectionate toward her. . . I usually go around grab-assing her and pulling her close to me (which for the past few years has been met with nothing more than sighing and pulling away from me or with ""Let me go. . . I've got (insert whatever excuse) to do right now. . ."" every single time.  I actually looked at her a few months ago and told her that it gets very frustrating always getting rejected and that I'm not going to keep making the effort forever if this type of rejection keeps going on.  I guess she thought I was kidding. . . Now I've had enough.

For the past couple of weeks, I've made myself stop doing anything that would even seem the least bit like I was trying to have sex with her.  I've stopped touching her at all, no more little sexual innuendo being throw around in her direction, no more hugging her in bed (for the past week, I've even taken it to the extreme of starting to sleep alone), and no more ""special treatment"" like picking her up a cup of coffee without being asked when we stop at the gas station for fuel.  This is an extreme change because, as I said earlier, she literally kept a full set of my fingerprints on her ass at all times (I'm always been like that with her) and all my friends tell me that I spoil her.  I guess this has put her a position of power in our sexual relationship. . . and power can be fleeting.

After 2 full weeks, I finally saw the first signs this morning that things may be finally taking some effect.  She got her hair cut a couple of days ago and, when asked how I liked it (and I did), I just kinda gave it a non-interested ""It looks fine."" and left it at that.  (I really liked it because she cut it very short and it made her neck look delicious!)  She knew this type of hair style normally sent me into fits and she looked kind of puzzled when I didn't make a big deal about it.  She asked me this morning if her hair looked OK because she taking the kids to a birthday party. . . I gave her the same ""It looks fine."" and said nothing more and went on about my business like I barely noticed (Yes, I really liked it!).  She finally got this really confused look on her face and said ""Humph. . . You normally can't keep your hands off me when my hair's fixed like this. . . When it shows-off my neck. . . "" and left looking really pissed.  LOL  I think my little experiment may be getting some results.  I'll keep you guys posted. . . Maybe I've been a little too attentive in the past and just maybe it sucks when ""the shoe's on the other foot"".

We're quite affectionate, and hug, touch each other and say we love each other a lot.

We basically never fight, and she says she finds me attractive.(though she uses ""cute"" quite a lot which I'm not sure how to take especially when I'm trying to initiate)

I don't remember her initiating it in the last 6 months+ She says she has really low libido, doesn't lust over me at all but she does enjoy sex a lot when it happens. She orgasms most times we have sex, and I put her pleasure before mine.

I tried pleasuring her without wanting anything back for a while, which I liked doing but she doesn't go for that anymore.

I'm quite dominating, which she really likes because it makes her feel feminine. We tried that couples questionnaire thing and it didn't really get us anywhere because she isn't interested in much beyond vanilla sex.

If she's not in the mood I get it and don't push it, but it gets disheartening when I start getting passionate and she kills the mood to let me know she isn't interested over and over. It makes me feel less attractive, and it makes me find her less attractive.

It's especially disheartening when I really try to make the effort - cooking a nice dinner for her, showering and shaving, putting cologne on, giving her a massage etc and she then turns down my kisses and goes on the computer.

I've told her this (minus the finding her less attractive part) but neither of us are sure what to do about it. She isn't a switch I can turn on and I get that, but I'm worried that this might just keep going downhill and that we're both wasting each other's time.

1361077496.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,18ofea,I'm the LL...seeking positivity and the HL view!,16,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18ofea/im_the_llseeking_positivity_and_the_hl_view/,"I sure hope I am welcome here...I feel so very, very alone.  I'm 24/F/LL, engaged to my amazing 28/M/HL.  We've been together now almost 3 years, and struggling with my LL for about 2.5 years of that time.  Unfortunate, I know.

When we first met, sex was like breathing.  We did it multiple times a day, in all locations, all styles.  Then one day (literally, one day), everything stopped.  This has been a pattern I've experienced in all my relationships - initial HL then it plummets.  Except, this guy (my current fiance!) was different....I am head-over-heels in love, very attracted, and can't figure out why I'm not getting aroused.  Soon after my fall into LL, I fell into an even lower realm of self-worth.  I cried everyday, begged my SO to stay by my side, and constantly assured him that I wanted nothing more than to be the sexual partner he wanted and dreamed about.  I still very much feel this way.  I began treatment for Major Depressive Disorder, and after regularly taking a high dose of Effexor, the ""sun came out again"" but my libido never did.  We Googled; we read books; we scoured articles; and yet...nothing worked!  It's like I'm broken in some way; no sexual fantasies, no arousal, and no satisfactory (for me) intercourse.  I visited my primary care doctor and OB/GYN, to rule out any physical issues, and it was discovered that I have Hypothyroidism which is now being treated.  My testosterone and estrogen were checked, and both found to be in the normal range.  Now, we are seeing a Sex Therapist twice a month, I've sought individual therapy for my depression, added Wellbutrin to my regimen of anti-depressants (Effexor has been drastically lowered), and I apply Testosterone gel every morning.  I have even downloaded female erotica to read.  Yet no major change!

I cry myself to sleep almost every night...I WANT A SEX LIFE...I want to feel like a woman, I want to have desires and fantasies.  I want to make my SO feel secure and not nervous about marrying me and being stuck in a sexless marriage.  I am guilt-ridden all the time and shamed by our situation.  It's almost like the whole Sexual Train passed me by one day, I missed it all, and now I'm trying to catch-up.

A little bit more about me...
1)  I have never experienced orgasm, despite being sexually active for about 8 years now.  My SO believes that I would be more turned-on if I knew what an orgasm was like...but despite trying, no luck.
2)  I do not masturbate.  I was never ""inspired"" to masturbate, well, EVER.  When I do try it, there is no feeling...just numbness.  My SO purchased me a vibrator, and I feel so child-like and confused with it. Like, ""Uhh, what is this supposed to do?""  Any time that I am aroused, it is with a partner. Never alone.
3) We probably have intercourse about once a month, but I do provide my SO manual/oral relief at least 3x a week.  While I may not be satisfied, it's a huge relief to be able to satisfy him.
4) We have been practicing more touching, cuddling, and talking openly about sex.  This has been a comfort, and the one area where I've seen improvement for myself.

My SO and I have The Fight about our situation almost weekly.  It starts with me turning him down (""maybe tomorrow, please?"") and he shuffles off to escape the feelings of rejection.  I become so guilt-ridden that I beat myself up mentally, break down and cry, and we start going back and forth at each other about the situation. ""What if things don't ever improve?"", ""What does the agreeable situation look like?"", ""How could I ever live/be happy with someone else?""  The Fight usually ends with me collapsed, mentally exhausted, and both of us continuing to reassure each other of our resolve to improve things.  We love each other extraordinarily...we tell our therapist all the time that, ""We have the most perfect, enviable relationship...if only I had a normal libido!""

So this is my plea to the DB community...any recovering LLs like myself?  Any success stories from HLs and their once-LLs?",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_18ofea,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18ofea/im_the_llseeking_positivity_and_the_hl_view/,
1360646127.0,12,self.DeadBedrooms,18d0dx,Three Times This Year!,14,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18d0dx/three_times_this_year/,"Yeah! I've had sex three times this year so far.

All three were ""quickies"".

This is the norm now. He has his quickies every great now &amp; then, and I do for myself.

He has said that it is my extra weight gain (I have rapidly gained weight in the past 3 years because of a health problem that I'm getting back under control now). Ironically - he has been more than 50 pounds overweight since shortly after we married, and it is getting worse. But he thinks that is just fine &amp; dandy.

The problem is - he didn't want me when I was thin, either. He stopped wanting me the minute we got married. Before we were married I was super conservative &amp; wanted to wait for marriage. He was VERY interested then. Minute we got married - meh. (I have been overweight for 3 years out of a 13-year marriage. He has not been interested in me since we were newlyweds. It's just B.S.)

He only seems to want me if he thinks he can't have me. But then he gets bored quickly. The interesting part of this is that I am the only one who has ever initiated anything new, and he is VERY against it. He doesn't want anything new, ever.

When we first got married, any time I would initiate he would humiliate me. Turn me down in really mean ways. Once he said I had mental problems to want sex so much. I stopped initiating at all after several years of trying.

Now he says me not initiating is the other reason why we hardly ever have sex. Even now if I do initiate, he will make me feel stupid &amp; small about it. Then when I am near tears, he's suddenly interested.

His mother is a classic narcissist and manipulates &amp; controls all her children. She lives in a different country &amp; manipulates our marriage in all sorts of ways. Everything he does seems to be a reaction to her, or with her in mind. Even his hobbies are those things that he knows will annoy her, get a reaction out of her. She has been obviously trying to break our marriage for 13 years. This summer when we visited at home she kicked up the hostilities a great deal - and things have gone downhill between us since then. I think she is going to win.

But it seems like he is threatened by me being competent or self-assured. I've noticed over time that whenever I am confident he has to discourage me somehow, either by being bored with what I'm saying or ridiculing me outright. It is very subtle, but it has been effective. I've been fighting against this in my own mind for a couple of years now. He is VERY good at gaslighting - when I remind him of something he said even a short time ago (a few hours or days) he refuses to admit it ever happened. ""No I didn't. You're imagining things."" He will not acknowledge his mother's influence on things - even when it is patently obvious.

For a long time he wanted affection, all the time, lots of affection. Even though there was hardly any sex, he wanted to hold hands, play with my hair, etc. Now it is nothing. When he does touch me &amp; wants sex now, I feel like I'm being touched by a stranger.

It's as if he wants to have as little to do with me as possible. He only wants sex when he can't hold out any longer, and he wants it over with as quickly as possible.

My kids are 12 and 9. I no longer feel like this marriage has any real hope. I can no longer even imagine a future with him where we are a true working partnership with true intimacy. Right now I feel trapped because we live overseas and my kids are in an amazing international private school. I would have to wreck their lives to leave my husband.

I (f) have more experience than him, but he is also the best sex I've ever had. We agreed that we should slow down the sex a bit because we both saw long term potential, and didn't want to get bored later.

Over the next 2.5 years, the sexual frequency fluctuated between 2-5 times a week. Fluctuation was expected, and the amount was still satisfactory for both of us. My weight has also gone up and down, depending on work and stress, but never exceeding 10 extra pounds (I'm 5'2, anywhere from 130-140 lbs). The declines in our sex life don't always sync up with my weight gain, so I can't blame it all on that. The fact that we've been working together could definitely have something to do with it, but the sex was great even when we were working together 60hr/wk.

About 6 months ago, our work started to slow down. This gave us more time to hit the gym (he invited me to cancel my current gym, and sign up with him), and I was in the best shape I'd ever been in since we met. After almost a year of stress, sleepless nights, and junk food where we worked together every night, we were finally able to sleep in our own beds (he lives with his parents, and I rent an apartment), work out regularly, and the pounds just started to fall off of me. I looked hot, I felt hot, but all of a sudden, it seemed like he wasn't interested.

I brought it up to him, and he said we weren't having as much sex because he wasn't sleeping over as often. This was true, because he had often slept over after work out of necessity (I was too tired to drive him home, and we had to leave for work early the next day), and now that we were working less, he wanted to spend more time at home with his parents. So yes, we weren't having sex because he wasn't sleeping over, but I felt like he could sleep over more if he wanted to. I don't like to nag, so I decided to let it go, and see if things would improve. First it was a week without sex. Then a week and a half. The frequency kept decreasing.

I started out sad that I felt unwanted, but after a while, the sadness became anger. I'm often in a bad mood for no reason. He used to make sarcastic comments that I would find amusing, but now the comments just sound rude, and I'll make a snippy remark back. Then we get irritated with each other, and the cycle continues.

I find him very physically attractive, but his lack of career drive is a turn off for me. The fact that he isn't trying to move out of his parents house, doesn't have a driver's license, and isn't looking for a better job, makes me feel almost like a mother figure. I enjoy cooking for him and taking care of him, but I always felt like I was demonstrating my ""wife"" abilities. Now that we're not having sex, I feel like more of a caregiver than a partner. These thoughts are creeping into what few intimate moments we have, and it's driving me crazy. Lack of sex is making me feel like a mother figure, and feeling like a mother figure makes me enjoy sex less, but I do what I can to ignore these thoughts because I don't want a DB.

TL;DR- Sex frequency is decreasing with many possibilities as to why. I've already brought it up with him a few times, and I'm worried if I keep bringing it up, it will make it worse. Lack of sex is starting to make me enjoy it less, so how can I stop this before the weeks between sex become months?

Edit- This post is only regarding the troublesome parts of our relationship. I read through it again, and realized that from a third person perspective, I would tell the OP to break up because he sounds like a douche. My BF is *not a douche.* He is a phenomenal person, which is why I'm working so hard to make it work.

Since getting engaged 4 years ago, the frequency of sex had fallen considerably.  Despite my efforts, sex only comes once a month. This are no exceptions for special occasions either. Valentines, New Years, Birthdays; these have all become dreadful due to my wanting of sex. 

Frequency of sex is not the only problem. Since getting wed, my SO has let her physical self go, and has become extremely conservative in her attire. She had gained 50 pounds since getting wed, she is somewhere over 200 pounds now.  I try often to get her to wear sexy things, but she will always refuse, because she doesn't like her body, but she will not make any real effort to improve her body either. Combine this with the Coolridge effect, and my lust for my SO has dried up considerably. I will often see a woman who has a similar body type as my SO, but who puts on a short skirt with a boob top. I strongly desire the appearance and confidence. Recently at her birthday, I asked my SO to change clothes into something more visually appealing. She refused, and I was crushed. In addition, I had tried to have sex in the two days leading up to her birthday. She refused, but stated that we would have crazy sex the next day. There was no sex. In fact, Aruba would be the next time we made love. Empty promises of sex occur frequently in our relationship.

The Aruba trip a month ago was my last full force effort to repair the shambles of my sex life. When the trip was initially planned, I talked to my SO about an effort to improve our bodies for the trip. She agreed, and I began working out. I wanted this to work out more than ever, and this wanton desire clouded my judgement that it probably wouldn't. In early October, I was able to have sex with my SO, after about a 1.5 month hiatus. Afterwords, a sex talk commenced afterwards. She told me tales of reinvigoration to our sex life, and to improving her body. She talked about wanting to have sex all the following week when she was off her period, and how Aruba would be a sex fest. I truly believed it, because I just wanted it so bad.

The illusion began to fade as quickly as it came. Before the end of the week, the trips to the gym had stopped. Large quantities of bad food was being eaten, and despite my efforts, sex was not there. Not even once ever for the supposed sex week. No sex would be had at all that month. Once in Aruba, I tried to have sex, but again was shut down the first two nights. We had sex on the third night, after I was admittedly quite pouty during the day at the prospect of our sex lives going down the tubes again. I tried more for the rest of the week, culminating with the statement on the last night, ""Why do you always try to have sex with me when Im feeling tired""?

So here I am, having given one failed last ditch effort to save our sex lives, contemplating divorce.  We have no kids. The problem is that outside of the sex life she is a good person to me. She has a good head on her shoulders, and she is good around the house with responsibilities. I just wish things would go back to the way they were, but I think I have finally accepted that they will not.

1353566393.0,12,self.DeadBedrooms,13lz1v,I have been in two relationships with dead bedrooms. They were both my fault.,17,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/13lz1v/i_have_been_in_two_relationships_with_dead/,"I have browsed this subreddit for a while because it sounded similar to what I had gone through, except it seemed to mostly be from the other side: people talking about their SO's not being interested in them sexually.

This is the other side of that story. My side, at least.

I was in two long term relationships where I lost interest in having sex with my exgirlfriends.

**TL;DR Everything got boring and it's hard to want to have sex with someone who is boring**

Before the sex stopped, other things stopped. We stopped hanging out with friends. Well, more specifically, I stopped hanging out with friends, because in all honesty neither of these women had friends and just assumed all of my friends we de facto their friends. Now, people who don't have friends of their own tend to not be able to make friends at all, and to alienate the people around them. 

I know because I watched this happen. Twice. Both of these women entered my life and ended my social life, almost pathologically. This was partly my fault, however, because I shouldn't have let anyone do that to me. But after going through that it's something I can never forgive anyone for doing to anyone else.

Other things stopped, and thinking about what ""other things"" means I realize it means everything. I stopped doing hobbies of mine because they thought they were stupid; they had no hobbies because nothing was worth doing anyway. I stopped working out despite getting gym memberships together because they'd rather watch the same rerun on TV that night and I was sure as hell not going to do anything without them. We stopped going out because while they never cared what movie we saw, they damn well sure didn't want to see whatever I had a positive impression of. We even stopped going out to eat because it became a chore. We could only chose from a couple of the same restaurants-- that she liked-- because they absolutely, positively hated every other kind of food, and what kind of moron tries new things anyway?

Keeping all this in mind, this is what sex turned in to. A compromise. A chore. What we did because we never did anything else.

I had to initiate. I had to do all the work. They didn't prefer any position or have any opinion on sex, just that we must have it despite how frustrated I was with how they were acting.

I heard way too many times, ""I'll just lay down, you get on top of me."" 

Does that actually sound attractive to anybody?

Obviously it became a topic of discussion, but the discussions went nowhere. They became overly defensive if I tried telling them why.

One actually told me she didn't need to do anything else since she had me in a long term relationship. Like I was her fucking pet, or, more disturbingly, her child.

When I pointed out to the other that staying home every weekend drinking vodka and watching reruns was pathetic, her response was to switch to wine.

Both questioned my masculinity during these conversations. Both accused me of cheating-- I never did, and I never intend to cheat on anyone. 

Both called me all sorts of names.

Then, of course, they expected me to fuck them.

I've been single for four years now and it's been the best time of my life.

What I have noticed the most while being single is that when I'm the most active, the most social, and having the most fun, I have had a very high sex drive-- but that depends a great deal on who I am seeing. I've found myself uncomfortably close to getting into serious relationships with women who were much too similar to my exes, and my sex drive suffered when I was around them.

At this point, I think I am finally ready to try another long term relationship. I just may not be cut out for them, however. But I will be more than happy being single for life if that means having a life worth living.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_13lz1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/13lz1v/i_have_been_in_two_relationships_with_dead/,

This makes me so sad, I can tell he'll make a fantastic husband and father, and I want a person like this to be my husband and father to my children, but the sexual aspect to our relationship isn't there anymore.

I wish WISH they were there, if they were then we'd be set to stay together and grow old together, but I just don't feel it.
We've talked about it at length, and the hardest part is that he still is attracted to me physically, but I just don't feel it :(

My question to anyone who's been in this type of situation, is can the attraction come back?  In the last 6 months we've maybe done it 3 or 4 times.  We've discussed our (differing) sex drives, he'll say himself that his interest in sex and sexy times is about 3/10, whereas mine is probably 9.5/10.  This in itself wouldn't be too much of a problem if I was still attracted to him, because he recognises that although our level of desire are different, that we can meet in the middle and both still be satisfied.

I want to want him, I just don't anymore and it kills me.

1353013463.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,139cvi,Husband wont initiate sex but masturbates regularly,18,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/139cvi/husband_wont_initiate_sex_but_masturbates/,"I (26f) and my husband (26m) have been together for 10 years, living together for 7 and married for 1. We don't have sex as much as either of us would like. I would say it happens anywhere from once a week to once a month depending on how many hours he is working. We have talked about it in the past and it came down to me saying that I feel he never initiates it which makes me feel needy and unattractive and him saying he feels like when he does initiate it I turn him down. 

I was shocked by his side of the argument since I don't feel like that ever happens. We ended up deciding that when he feels like he is initiating sex he is being so subtle and tentative that I never realize he's not just being affectionate. For example, when we go to bed he'll kiss me for a minute or two and then stop, roll away a little, and just look at me. If I don't then take the initiative to throw myself at him he feels as if I have rejected his advances. How am I supposed to know that this time he wanted sex and non just a pre-sleepy-time cuddle? (more about this later- our morning sex issues definitely feed into him feeling like I always reject him) 

Since we talked the first few times I do try to initiate in that situation much more but always having to be the aggressive one still just makes me feel needy and unwanted. I want him to want me enough to go for it, you know?

Most of the time when we do have sex I don't orgasm. We've talked about that as well and I've assured him that sometimes I don't mind because it still feels really nice and I enjoy the feeling of closeness I get from sex. This is completely true, but sometimes I also just really need an orgasm. 1/10 times he puts in the extra effort and gets me there and I always indicate during as well as tell him after that it was and he is great. 1/10 times I want an orgasm but he doesn't put in the effort so I incorporate masturbating myself into the sex. This makes him really insecure. He starts to pull away both physically and emotionally and almost pouts about it. I ask him to continue with what he was doing to help me get there but he always just says ""I'm running out of tricks. There is only so much more I can do"" I try to tell him that he really doesn't need to have any fancy tricks or need to change up what he's doing all that much- I just need a little more time and more of the same. It still pretty much kills the mood when he's being so insecure and I end up feeling like a selfish, unattractive bitch for insisting that he stick around until I orgasm. 

One of our other main problems is that he usually wants sex in the morning and I have a horrible time waking up. It generally takes me about 10 minutes to figure out where I am and what is going on. I can't move my limbs right away and have a cloudy, confused, type of headache until I am all the way up. As you can imagine, this makes it hard to get in the mood when he is trying to wake me up for sex and I tend to be kind of cranky until I stop being confused. That being said, once I am all the way awake I'm always up for some morning sex. The problem is that, even though we've talked about it and I've explained all of that, my husband is never willing to stick around until I've woken up completely. This leads to him masturbating in the shower on a regular basis.  We've talked about that as well and I've told him that I don't care if he masturbates except for when I feel like it's depriving me and our relationship. Lately I'm feeling very deprived. 

Last night I tried to initiate sex and he rolled over and went to sleep. That's fine, he works a lot and needs his rest. This morning I was awake first and I tried to wake him up sexy-like. He crawled over me and went straight to the shower. I still didn't feel bad- maybe he just didn't want to be late for work and didn't have time. Then he showered for 45 minutes with the door to the bathroom closed. That only ever means one thing. I lay in bed feeling rejected and unwanted, until he got out of the shower, passive-aggressively asked me to do laundry today, and left for work. I'm really upset about it because he clearly chose masturbation over sex with me. He tells me all the time that he thinks I'm sexy and beautiful but his actions show differently and I'm starting to feel really bad about myself because of it. 

What's a girl to do? I've considered just going in there and joining in but I feel like there is a reason that he's left me out and he probably would just get embarrassed and not want sex anyway. We've talked it to death. No matter how nicely I try to approach it and how reassuring I try to be he always just ends up sulking and feeling attacked. Are there other ways that I can try to address my needs with him without making him insecure that he's doing the wrong thing? Would it be so impossible for him to wake up horny but wait until the end of the day and have sex with me then? I'm at a loss for what to do next. Any ideas?

tl;dr husband and I are in a dry spell sexually speaking. He's been choosing morning shower masturbation over sex with me and we never have sex unless I'm very aggressive about it. He's too insecure to have a productive conversation about it. I heard you guys might be able to help.

Been with her for 4.5 years now and we are engaged.  When together we had decently frequent sex.  She never initiated and sort of detached herself as if I just wasn't there (eyes shut always, no talking, purposefully muffled moans).  She seems to enjoy herself and I feel the gentle pulsate/tightening so I think she cums.  We've had a few conversations and she talks about how she doesn't like to talk about explicitly about sex because she feels weird.  I work out three times a week and work hard to stay in shape; she is very beautiful and also in shape.  Maybe she just isn't physically into me though.

Anyway, now we're long distance and  the only thing we could have is talking about sex, which she hates doing.  Pics are completely out of the question, I only brought it up once and we had a conversation where she got really upset, so putting on more pressure won't work.  I think she's more of an average libido, but completely reactive.  She never tells me if she's horny and can't articulate what turns her on/what she likes/what she wants to try, yet doesn't reject me in person (only long distance).

So I sometimes try to spark some sexual conversation very gently and she'll deflect by saying something silly.  Recently she told me sometimes she thinks all I think about is sex, but not in an overly harsh way.  The next day I brought it up and explained the typical DB good stuff about how she's not just a vagina to me, sex is important to me, and that I miss being intimate with her and having fun in bed, which she said she appreciated hearing (though it is very sad to hear she actually thought otherwise in the first place, I bring it up barely at all, like once a month).  I said I wanted to really talk about this more before we get married and she agreed to it.

So I have set myself up for a nice opportunity to talk to her about our future sex life and I don't want to ruin it.  Given how I've described her, do you have any tips so that will really get the point across about intimacy without putting too much uncomfortable pressure on?  I feel like we've never had that real passionate we're-Vikings-on-a-sinking-ship sex and wish she could feel comfortable enough to open up to me with her desires.

It wasn't until last night that we talked about the weekend.  She told me that this is the worst thing anyone has ever said to her and she's not sure if she can ever forgive me.  She also said that her weight is, in her words, ""spiraling out of control"" and that she's sorry she's been ignoring the problem and getting mad at me when I would try to help.  I told her that I really wasn't turned off by her appearance as evidenced by the fact I still want to bone as much as ever, I'm just frustrated that she's not taking care of herself and won't allow me to care for her in that way either.  I told her I didn't marry her just because she's good looking and that I'm proud to have her as my wife.  Lots more was said but those are the big things.

Moving forward, we're going to be roommates for a few months while she tries to figure out if we can move past this.  I don't think it will be too awkward as we've always had a strong friendship, even before we got together.  We've also made a meal plan that we'll begin on Thursday.

I've been lurking on Reddit and DeadBedrooms for a while now, and have finally been driven to post. I've been married to my wife for 4 months now, and I want to start by saying that divorce is completely off the table- not a possible consideration. 

We waited (by mutual agreement) to have sex until we were married. Before we got married, she couldn't keep her hands off me and seemed horny all the time. She had previously had sexual relationships before us (which doesn't bother me in the least), and I had done everything but PIV sex with a previous serious girlfriend. 

Here's the thing- when we have sex, it's amazing. She is multi-orgasmic, and is an energetic and unselfish lover when we actually do have sex. However, what was 3-4 times a week when we're were newly married has slowly devolved into once a week or so now, only 4 months in. I know there are plenty of guys and gals in here that would live to get it that frequently, but it's just not enough for me. I end up feeling disconnected, unloved, and undesirable, which quickly devolves into a bitter and mopey attitude unless I am constantly holding myself in check. 

We are currently seeing a well-qualified pastor from our church (wrote his master's thesis on the importance of sex in relationships and is a certified counselor), which we both agrees was a necessity. She understands that she's not meeting my needs, and she genuinely feels terrible about it. 

What seems to be the sticking point is that she nearly always refuses to engage in any sexual intimacy unless she initiates it. She has told me that she thinks that since sex is something to be shared and mutually enjoyed, she shouldn't ever engage in any sexual contact unless she's ""in the mood"". Now please hear me clearly on this- I want nothing to do with any kind of sex with her that she is not interested in. What I want is to be desired by my wife. 

Also, here's a bit of background to answer the usual questions. We are m(25) and f(25), both in good athletic shape since losing excessive weight before we met each other. We both work full time, I go to school full time as well, I do all the cooking and dishes, I do the majority of the housework, and she gets daily foot rubs and other relaxing physical touch. We don't lack for affectionate physical touch, which is love language #1 for both of us (took the test and read the book). She is on hormonal bc (Mirena iud), but she has been on hormonal bc for years and it hasn't affected her libido. 

She regularly praises me for how affectionate I am and how well I meet her needs. I just understand why she won't meet mine. 

Edit: missed words

Second Edit: last night, she approached me for sex. At first I was ecstatic, but I quickly lost hope after sensing she wasnt into it like she usually is, and it came out pretty quickly that this was ""duty sex"" (my term, not hers). Needless to say, I I wasn't interested since she pretty clearly wasn't. We had a good talk, and it finally came out that some of the abusive and manipulative relationships she's had in the past are really affecting her. We will continue to work on this and through counseling.

In the past he's vented his frustrations to me about not getting anything from me, and now when I'm confident enough to take the next step, he doesn't want anything to do with me.
I feel ugly. I feel useless. I get this feeling he's lost interest in me, and it kinda hurts when he doesn't take steps to fix this problem. When he let me know his frustrations, I started doing things to get through the issue. Why doesn't he do the same? Does he still love me? If he does, why won't he have sex with me?


Thank you kindly for responding. In answer to a few questions, he has had sex before. In the past we've talked about sex and I've tried to initiate, but it always comes back to ""I am out of shape, and I need to get back into exercising."" He feels he won't be able to keep it up. When he tells me he'll get a gym membership he changes his mind. If exercise is what is causing the lack of ambition, then why wouldn't he try to fix this issue? There's no doubt in my mind he'd lie to me. A while back he told me how frustrated he was with work and not getting any sex from me. I've always been a little fearful of having sex. I'm afraid of getting pregnant, and I didn't want to have sex with him when his friends were living in the rooms surrounding his. So, we took steps to fix this. We got our own place together.

Help!!,13,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/11yeev/our_problem_her_problem_my_problem_help/,"Hello all....  my situation is your typical DB sob-story: 25 year old male with 24 year old GF, we've been together for 5 years and been living together for 4. As you can guess, our sex life has become non-existent and our bed room hasn't had a pulse in months. I'd like to chalk this up to the routine and comfortableness that often accompanies the slow death of sex in long-term relationships but I can't... there are underlying issues at work and this is where I need some advice....
Ever since we initially ""hooked up"" she's had an issue with vaginal penetration. The first few times we tried to have sex we had to stop as soon as I entered her because she said it hurt or ""stung."" Now, I'm not naive and I know that my penis is nowhere near the proportions it would need to be to cause pain.... so, I attributed it to her needing to feel secure and be able to trust me before we could manage sex. Sure enough, after bonding and showing her that I care for her, we were able to have sex and the thrill of that accomplishment kept us going for awhile. For the first couple years we were having sex regularly but it was never anything to write home about... I was mostly satisfied that we could finally do it and that I was able to get her off by going down on her. 
However, as time passed, other problems surfaced and now I'm wondering if I should have pulled the plug on this a long time ago....
For one thing, she's never been very affectionate towards me and when I've mentioned to her that I would like more affection she has said that it's her ""personality"" to not be very affectionate. I'm not nitpicking here either, she rarely initiates hugs or embraces and rarely ever caresses me. On top of this, she's always had an issue with French-kissing and I can't recall a time when we ""made out."" She's told me that she doesn't like it and it drives me crazy because I do, and I know from previous relationships that I'm not a terrible kisser.
This unequal distribution of affection filtered into the bedroom as well. I like giving pleasure but our sex has always been a routine in which I do 95% of the work and it became boring. Due to her penetration issues, foreplay consists of a massage and then cunnilingus. Once she is turned on enough, and if I can manage penetration, we have intercourse until she finds it too uncomfortable and then we stop to finish each other off orally(me to her) and manually (her jerking me off). In the five years we've been together, I think I've orgasmed insider of her once. This routine, and the constant process of stopping mid-sex, has led to me feeling unsatisfied. I've addressed this with her and asked her if there's anything I can do to help and she agrees its a problem but has never done anything about it. I've also approached her about spicing things up in bed, asked her what turns her on and it's gone nowhere. She was reading 50 Shades of Grey and admitted that she likes it when the guy takes control.... but I've been taking control since the beginning and it's almost like an excuse for her to just lay there and do nothing during sex.
I've told her that I find confident women sexy and I wish she was more sexually confident but she hasn't attempted to change at all. She's a very beautiful girl, guys hit on her all the time, yet she still has massive self-esteem issues and I feel like it's affecting my view of her. As women always say that they find confidence to be the most attractive trait in men, I think it goes both ways and I find I've become less and less sexually attracted to her.
To add to all this, I was unfaithful to her in the past and it plagues me to this day. She does not know this, but a few summers back while she was doing a study-abroad program in Europe, I had a one-night stand with my ex. And though I still feel extremely guilty, I think about that night all the time.... it was the best sex I've had in as long as I can remember. We screwed all night long, hot and sweaty, grunting and groaning, dirty talking.... it was so good that we had sex again when we woke up the next morning. I regret it but at the same time I don't regret it.... it reminds of the fact that I love having sex and that with the right person sex can be absolutely incredible.
And this worries me because I don't know what to do now.
The boring and passionless sex, the disappointment of not being able to have intercourse for more than 5 minutes and the sheer lack of affection from her has all resulted in me being fairly uninterested in my girlfriend these days. I still love her but there's that huge component missing in the relationship that leaves my feeling frustrated and concerned for the future.
I've taken the steps to address the problem with her a few times now but I find myself back at square one again. I would love to know what you all think of this situation.... is it salvageable? Should I just give up? Is there something I'm doing wrong?

1350501547.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,11n8gg,"Average Libidos, but Sexually Incompatible",14,0,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/11n8gg/average_libidos_but_sexually_incompatible/,"Boy am I glad I found you guys. Where to begin.
 
I’m a 26 female and my bf is 31. We’ve been together a little over a year. We are facing some serious DB issues and we are both unsatisfied. We both want more and better sex, but have an innate incompatibility with each other sexually that neither of us has experienced before.

In the beginning things were great. I joyfully told my friends it was the best sex I’d ever had. Then things changed over time. I realize this is only my perspective, but I will try to throw in the issues he’s brought forward also.

Firstly, he used to go down on me a lot. And it was good. It waned over time and now I can’t remember the last time. We talked about it and he finally told me he doesn’t enjoy going down on me because I’m too difficult and I don’t provide enough feedback. I feel like I do, I’ve told him exactly what I like, but I feel he’s just being lazy and so blames me. For info, it takes 10-15 minutes, and I always get there. 

I told him when we first met that I don’t orgasm from intercourse alone, like many many women out there. He thinks this is bizarre since all his previous gfs could do it (I have begged him to consider they possibly faked). He blames me again and says I have mental blocks. At first it didn’t matter and he went down on me, played with me, etc., but like I said, that has disappeared. After awhile he suggested we stop having sex and just do oral because we know it works. Wow, did that ever hurt to hear my boyfriend suggest no sex at all. He said it was too much work and he doesn’t enjoy it because he’s only thinking of me and can’t enjoy himself. So it’s the “I’m too selfless” argument. To me it’s obvious that he is the one with mental blocks about it. There’s nothing unusual about not cumming from intercourse alone. I feel that I’m being punished because I can’t do it. 
Actual penetration is down to maybe 2-3 times a month, with some other activities in between. I give him oral about once a week, but often I get nothing in return. He just tells me “good job, I’ll get you tomorrow” and goes to sleep. And tomorrow never comes. Pun intended. I’ve confronted him about this and he says he can’t function after he cums, so I can’t do him first. That’s fine too, but he never initiates, so what then? I don’t feel comfortable saying “Hi please go down on me.” That kills the fun for me.

He wants anal, but I won’t do it. I experimented before so I’m not against it, but in 2009 I had a medical problem involving that area, and the doctors kept asking me if I inserted things into my anus (because that coulda caused the problem). I didn’t insert anything and it was just a fluke medical condition, but it required surgery and was very painful. I feel I have more reason than most girls not to do it. The other day we had sex and to make him happy I said “ok give it a try.” And he just went “nahh I know you don’t want to.” So I can’t win. I offer to do the thing that will satisfy him and he says no. 

During our talks about this he has repeatedly called me reserved. In reality, I have bought us vibrators, creams, toys, lingerie, etc. and used them all with him. Yes, that sounds really uptight. I loved the wevibe but he didn’t like it. I used a vibrator on my clit alone, but he said it was distracting and he felt he had to hold out too long until I came first and by then he was numb. He’s upset that I won’t blow him after he has penetrated me. I’ve tried to just wipe him with a baby wipe first but he says that ruins it for him. He says I have too many “rules” about place and time for the act, but we both work 8-4 Monday to Friday, so to me the times for sex are evening and weekend. Duh.

I would love some advice from you guys. I would say we are both average libido, but we just butt heads on so many sexual issues that it’s becoming a big ugly elephant in the room and it’s just easier to avoid sexual things. Attraction is there, tons of affection is there, and lots of love on both sides is there.

Edit: After another teary conversation about my non-satisfaction yesterday, he came clean about a medical problem he's been having for 3 months. He has a severe anal fissure that's causing bleeding and anal leakage (sorry about TMI) and he admitted he's been feeling very unsexy and unhorny for a while because of it. he said anything involving taking his underwear off makes him uncomfortable because of it. I feel this is a pretty legit reason for a low libido, but does it explain his lack of pleasuring me? I'm not sure. Taking him to the doctor tonight. We'll see if treating this problem will help our bedroom woes.

edit: It has gotten a little better since having a few talks about this. I used a lot of information found on deadbedrooms and it really opened his eyes. He has agreed that he has a responsive libido, and had never considered that before. He realized his exes always initiated, and he was always happy when they did. It's true, I'm never ever turned down, he just lacks in the initiation department. So maybe this revelation isn't the worst thing, it's just how he is and we have to adapt our sex life around it. Could be worse, I mean I can get it whenever I want it. Now we just have to work on more oral sex. I was blunt with him about needing more. Thanks everyone for your input!

1348756152.0,14,self.DeadBedrooms,10kbg6,I'[M] a newlywed.  This seems wrong.,16,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/10kbg6/im_a_newlywed_this_seems_wrong/,"I'm 25, recently married to a 24 year old woman.  My wife was a virgin when I met her (she was 20 then) and it took over a year and a half for her to be ready for sex.  She'd dated a lot but refused to get intimate with anyone before me--sexually, or even emotionally.  

At one point before we started having sex, she went on accutane and all sexual contact stopped cold.  I put up with that figuring things would get better after, and they did, somewhat.  Lot of patience needed there.  It got me started saying ""I just need to do X and she will want sex as much as I do.""  I wish it hadn't.

She seems to experience very low levels of stimulation.  She has trouble getting wet, and has never in her life orgasmed without a clitoral vibrator.  I understand that--this is just how it is for some women--but I'm a good lover and it's a bit hard on my ego.  Unfortunately, that's not her only issue--she's never open to morning sex of ANY kind, hates even being kissed in the morning, won't kiss me with tongue anywhere outside of the bedroom, hates receiving oral and isn't much a fan of giving it.  She can't stand 'mess' during sex, and was horrified of pregnancy (we're childfree) so much that she is afraid to even let me touch her down there if I've handled myself.  I had a vasectomy to deal with that and now she complains of the 'dripping' if I finish inside her. This doesn't leave me with a lot of options to get turned on by our foreplay, and most of her idea of foreplay is receiving a LONG back massage from me, then immediate penetration.  

After we started having sex, there was no 'honeymoon' period.  Almost immediately we slipped back to sex about once a week or less, and I was not happy.  Anytime I raised the issue with her she told me I was grossly overestimating how much people have sex--but we were YOUNG, and I wanted it.

I lost fifty pounds, going from 240 to 190 (at my height that is very fit!).  Over the following year or two, she GAINED fifty pounds.  

I proposed and she moved in, and I kind of thought at that point that she'd want it more.  Nope.  It was about the same as before we lived together--1 to 2 times a week.  Then we got married.  On our honeymoon, she managed to not only ""miscalculate"" her period so as to go on it during the honeymoon (despite me asking her to check on this ahead of time to avoid that issue), but also had planned to end her use of birth control and actually forgot to take her pill the last couple days before the wedding, bringing the period to start almost as soon as we were gone.  She then took some of the remaining pills to ""stop"" it.  That didn't work, and long story short, she was basically on her period for our entire 2-week honeymoon, excepting a couple days.  When I suggested we lay a towel down she threatened violence.  She DID eventually decide to do that anyway, and we had sex maybe half the days of our honeymoon--and that's the most frequent sex we've ever had--but it seemed like a far cry from what's supposed to be happening.

Now, I had problems here too--I had a porn addiction and since we didn't have sex for the first 1.5 years, it got worse.  I didn't stop when we started having sex.  I know it affected my libido and I think it reduced hers further too.  It lasted for a while in part because she didn't pick up, and it got worse. 

Eventually, I did quit it, but things didn't get better.  I got way hornier and she got no hornier.  And she started getting annoyed by my sexual interest in her.  Groping is apparently not OK even in our private home.  

She has asked me to stop initiating and indicated she'll initiate when she's ready.  I felt insulted by this--as though she only wants it on her terms.  Unfortunately it's made me want to reject her the way she rejects me, and I know that's going to make our problems worse.

I kind of feel trapped now, because when I've brought this issue up she's responded either with hostility or indifference, claiming I have no idea how much a couple is ""supposed"" to have sex.  I *want* sex.  It makes me want to resume my porn addiction.  A day after we got back from our honeymoon, I did just that.  

Now I'm attempting to separate myself from it again, but I feel a sense of dread for the future.  I don't know what's left to do and the answer to how to deal with an indifferent response to a dead bedroom kind of escaped me some time ago.

I know our situation isn't as bad as that of some or most of you--but it FEELS bad.  We're young.  I'm at a loss for what to do.  ",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_10kbg6,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/10kbg6/im_a_newlywed_this_seems_wrong/,

I am 6'2"", and was 160 lbs at the height of the first pregnancy, and he blamed my weight after the birth. I spiraled into an old eating disorder (A/N) and dropped down to 127 lbs. Then he said it wasn't my weight, it was my face that turned him off. We separated for a while, got back together after some counseling, and the bedroom livened up again, and the behavior tapered off a bit. I got pregnant again, but all was well until I started to show again at 6 months. this pregnancy I maxed out at 140 lbs, now currently 121. He blamed my weight again mid-pregnancy, and I went back to my eating disorder. It's more than the lack of sex that triggers it. It's the lack of touch. The lack of even a peck on the cheek. The lack of control I have over the whole situation. It isn't much to ask that maybe three times per week, we could even have a cuddle. I stopped grovelling for sex a while back, but I miss the touch, the feeling of being loved. I feel that if I'm starved that way, I might as well starve over something I can control. I want to become invisible. I want to fade into the background. I'm 24 years old. I should be in the prime of my life right now. I should be sexually active. But I'm not. He even gave me a ticket to have an affair. I don't know whether to feel angry, humiliated, ashamed, or insulted, but I do know I feel all of the above. I can't believe he is lazy enough to even consider giving me a ticket for that bullshit. It may not be viewed as cheating if it was permission, but it would cross my moral boundaries if I cashed it. 

I know deep down that I'm not unattractive, but being a young female and being denied sex really hurts my confidence in so many ways. Tonight, I tried again for sex for the first time in months. I feel humiliated that I walked in front of him naked, only to him telling me to move out of the way because he's busy watching his Air Crash Investigation shows. He didn't even bat an eye to me. I laid in bed sobbing, he came to bed, told me to get dressed and hit the computer. So here I am. I know it's not a sexual dysfunction in him, he can be easily aroused, just not by me. He doesn't have a porn addiction, neither. He seems to be just not existing sexually. As if he has no desire (though he says he loves sex, pfft right). He hasn't had affairs (that I know of), neither do I suspect it. Everyone's going to say it's his age, and maybe it is. He's not on any meds at all. So I really don't know what is going on, and every communication ends in his being defensive and emotionally abusive towards me. I don't nag about anything, not even the toilet seat. I know this can't be fixed at all, so we are finally filing for divorce. I am scared to ever get into a relationship again, because I feel jaded towards relationships and DB situations, and have a feeling that this is going to happen over and over again. 

I just can't shake the feeling that I am not good enough for anybody. That I'll never be thin/pretty/hot/attractive enough, and that everything will end in emotional/sexual neglect. I feel like I've wasted my life on someone who doesn't reciprocate affection/intimacy/sex and that now that I'm passing my prime (in my own eyes) and have children, I won't find anyone else unless they're people trying to take advantage of my brokenness.

Since then I've managed to get fit and stay fit.  I lift weights 3 days per week and run 3 days per week even today.  About one year into my transformation, my wife was inspired to do the same.  Over the next 6 months she lost a lot of weight and looked the best she ever has.  During this time we were having sex at least twice per week and it was good.  Really, really good.  I spent hundreds of dollars on sexy lingerie and toys.  Now they're collecting dust.

Over the last year she's gained back all that she lost.  I don't look at her the same way as before and she can tell.  I still love her as much as ever and I tell her every day, but it's hard for her to feel sexy.  Liquor helps her a bit in that regard and allows us one decent encounter per month on average.  I could get as much as I want if I just ask her for it, but it's not good for me unless she really wants it too.  If I were to also make sex a chore for her, my sex life would likely not recover.

Her personal projects over the last year revolve around food.  Growing, cooking, preserving and of course eating.  She even remarked to me one time, 'boy I sure have been eating a lot'.  This prompted a discussion during which she asked me to help her stay on track with her exercising.  I was thrilled and she went for about two weeks before the excuses started.  Eventually I gave up because she just wasn't making an effort with exercising nor her diet.  Even if I could have convinced her to continue exercising, she wouldn't have made any progress because it's near impossible to out exercise a shitty diet.  She's been doing most of the cooking lately and was in the middle of long-term plans regarding our meals.  This made it near impossible to take over the food preparation as I would have liked.  I've made suggestions and requests and offers to take over, but I can't get her off the cycle of rice, pasta, potato with cookies after every meal, too little protein and too few vegetables.  Luckily I make my own breakfast and lunch so my own plans don't get ruined.

I continue to set the best example I can but I don't know how long I should let this go on.  I feel like it's time to really force the issue.  Either I'll fix things or break them irreparably.  The thought is terrifying but it's not going to get any easier, only more difficult.  I'm not sure if I'm willing to risk everything on this just yet, but it scares me to think of the future and how much worse things could get.  If I didn't have exercise to use as an outlet for my frustration, I probably would have taken it out on her and destroyed my marriage long ago.

At its worst, we went more than a year without any kind of intimacy, and the streak was only broken by a pity handjob she gave me.  I'm sure there are people who have gone longer without any sort of action, but I'm not exactly an expert on the subject due to this being the only ""sexual"" relationship I've had.

We're a modest couple so we don't really discuss it that much, but the root of the problem is apparently her anti-depressant meds.  She's been saying for the past few years that she's going to talk to her doctor about possibly switching onto something else to see if that will help anything, but not once has she ever brought it up during her check-ups.  I don't know if she's just too shy to ask or what, but whenever I bring it up she just gets depressed because of the guilt she has over ""being a bad wife"", as she calls it (i.e. not having sex).

Obviously if sex were that important to me, we would not still be together after so long, but I love her and I'm here to support her.  But it's like she doesn't even want to get help for it, she just doesn't want to do anything.  And then I get the little voice in the back of my head telling me that it's probably because she's just not attracted to me, that I'm ugly or too fat/too skinny.

The whole thing is just really starting to mess with my head and with my body, and when I mentioned it to her I just got another promise that she'll talk to her doctor next time.

So I'm all out of ideas, any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Neither she nor I are interested in toys, and if it makes any difference, I can count on my fingers the amount of times we've actually had vaginal sex.  It has almost exclusively been oral and hands.

I try to be understanding but I'm getting more and more resentful.  I love him, but I'm starting to hate him, specifically his dick for not doing what it needs to do.

He's always been a FPS and MMORPG gamer and it's always been an annoyance in our relationship to ask him to put the games down and come to bed.  This is 2 years in, I knew what I was getting into, I'm tolerant to a certain point.   But lately when I have to ask him to come to bed at 1 am (we have a kid who needs to be walked to school at 7 in the morning by one of us, so NEITHER of us gets enough sleep) I am starting to feel more like the mother of a teenage boy and less like anybody's lover.

So I asked him at midnight to come to bed.  He has 2 days off in a row (this is the 2nd) and he's no use to me when he sleeps in til noon, I'm up early in the morning and I have to pick up our kid from school at 3, after which it is all about the kid til 8:30 bedtime.  He could get his ass up and do stuff with me like a functioning member of a relationship, but opts to sleep in instead.  He's a great dad when kiddo comes home!  But after 8:30 guess what time it is?  Fucking games.

So.  I waited up til 1 am in bed knowing full well my ass would get about 5 hours of sleep as a result, I played with my awesome Lelo vibrator for a bit, hoping he'd come in and finish me off... I finished myself off, I waited some more, then I got up and threw a pillow at him.  And that's when I said what I said.  

He started crying that I was being really harsh and hurting his feelings.  Like I went too far.  Thoughts??

I guess it wasn't really the final straw... The idea of giving up on a good relationship just because of sex made me sick to my stomach.

After he returned, we spent a few tense hours arguing about other things (we've had some of his friends overstay their welcome recently, and it ended really badly with a lot of hurt feelings), but also had a pleasant brunch and shopping outing. 

Yesterday after work, I spent several hours doing yardwork, which turned into digging up tons of limestone from, what is now, an enormous hole in the backyard. I was stewing in frustration, trying to figure out how to ask him for more intimacy or if he'd rather throw in the towel. He came outside and saw the hole and asked me what I was doing because I ""had crazy eyes."" I made a joke about how this is what sexual frustration looks like. **Foot in mouth.** NOT how I wanted to start the conversation, but I've never been good with controlling my impulses. He looked sad and uncomfortable and went back inside to prepare dinner without saying anything.  

I followed him in and asked him to not be upset. A perfect conversation then commenced. He revealed that he doesn't feel close to me or like being sexual with me when I act so nagging and high-strung. I explained that the nagging originates from a decreased amount of forgiveness and flexibility ordinarily bestowed upon someone I see as a partner and lover, because, without intimacy, I don't feel that we are lovers. He asked what I want, and I replied that I want to have sex at least once a week, and I need more non-sexual contact and attention too. He said that he needs to feel more peace and emotional connection between us. I pointed out that we're in a cycle where my frustration leads to behavior that turns him off and when he's turned off I get more frustrated. I offered to break the cycle by controlling my nagging and being more flexible, for a certain number of days, and then we could sit down and assess how we were feeling. He agreed.

Less than an hour later, we were having sex.

It's a start, of course. We will both have to work to maintain the peace in our relationship, but I'm fairly certain that all relationships are a constantly evolving connection that requires work and commitment. And now that we are both aware of what the other person want and needs, we know where the work needs to go.

He is in his late twenties, I am in my early twenties. 

He has been struggling with depression/stress. It has taken a toll on his self-esteem and motivation. It has also taken a toll on his sex drive.

Ever since we got together, we haven't had that frequent of sex compared to ""normal"" couples I suppose. I would say it averages about 1-4 times a month. Unfortunately, we haven't had sex in about 5 weeks. We have done other sexual things, however, and still cuddle/kiss/hold hands/etc every day/night/regularly. 

All I can really do is be there for him, like he is for me. That said, it's hard to not feel bad about the situation. So tonight I had a talk with him. I told him I actually have cried. I told him that it does upset me sometimes. He was surprised, and he also apologized. He said it's not my fault and that he does very much find me attractive. I told him regardless of however much sex we have, I want to be with him. I told him I don't mean to pressure him if he feels that way. He told me that he doesn't often feel pressured, which was a relief.

He also told me, ""you're not the only one in this relationship not having sex. It bothers me too, that I can't even find the motivation to do it. I can't find motivation to do anything."" Him saying this really made me feel less alone, and moreso like we're in it together. 

Also, 3/5 weeks he had a very busy work schedule. He had to wake up at the crack of dawn, and drive outside the city. He wouldn't return home until the evening, and by that time he would be really tired/sore. I would see him for an hour or two, but he would always end up falling asleep really fast. So I do take that into consideration for why it's been as long as it has also.

He's a really good guy and we both see each other together far into our futures. It's just kind of hard right now. This is the longest it's ever been since we've had sex. I know that this isn't long for most couples here. But I just wanted to vent a little and just wanted someone who can relate to hear my story. Someone who understands..

Also adding, he is an Iraq veteran.. Not sure if that really plays a role in his depression/stress but I hear it isn't uncommon. If I suggested that it might be part of why he feels the way he does, I know he'd promptly deny it. He also has a couple very understandable, ongoing reasons to be depressed as well.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_ykncq,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ykncq/depressed_so_youre_not_the_only_one_in_this/,

We talk about it, he says he'll work on it, he doesn't, and we're back at square one.  He cut porn; he had a big problem with it a while back where he'd choose that over me, and that had a big effect on my self-esteem and resentfulness over time.  The damage was done by the time he cut it out out and he's had bad PE and ED problems since then.  I obviously don't do enough to turn him on like those girls did, or so it feels.  Honestly, I'm not very turned on either at this point... I want sex, but it's not like he really revs my engine, knowing I have to coax him and handle him with fucking kid gloves when I really just want to be devoured and ravished and fucked...

I didn't leave because I love him a whole lot.  Sex is our only big problem, and maybe I am stupid for believing it is fixable but I still have hope.

This last weekend I went to my hometown to see my folks and caught up with an old male friend who happens to be very handsome.  While he did pay me plenty of attention and make me feel like a fully functioning female for a night, no physical or emotional lines were crossed, and mostly I just told my boyfriend that we hung out in order to make him jealous.  He's never been the jealous type and his reaction was pretty tame at the time so I figured it didn't work.

I came home from my little trip horny as ever, and of course nothing happened when I made a move.  I did however ask him if we could have a serious talk today sometime to discuss what to do next about it.  We went to bed on opposite sides of the bed after kissing chastely goodnight and I fantasized about sex til I fell asleep. 
  
This morning he woke up angry and tearful, saying he had a dream I was cheating with that guy and asking me point blank if I was.  No, I am not.  He then asked me if he was the only one for me and if I still would consider marrying him next year like we'd talked about, and I told him honestly that I don't know.

How can I marry someone I feel lukewarm about in bed?  How can I believe with all my heart that he is the only one out of 6 billion people for me when we haven't had good sex in so long?  How can I live knowing a handsome and interesting man could chat me up for one night and make me feel like a woman for the first time in a year, then come home to feel less than a human being by my S.O. and still pledge forever to him when he won't even acknowledge my needs?  

We talk and we talk and we talk about it, and he knows I am horribly dissatisfied with our sex life but won't do a goddamn thing about it.  I keep telling him to set up a doctor's appointment but he keeps dragging his ass about it.  What's more embarrassing, going to a medical professional for help or explaining to everyone that you broke up an ideal-in-every-other-way relationship for seemingly no reason? 

I'm losing respect for him by the fucking day and he is just trivializing the whole thing.  Then he has the nerve to cry about a dream that should have been a serious wake up call.  Wake the fuck up.  Other men find your girlfriend attractive.  Your girlfriend is getting fed up.  Do something.

1343619827.0,12,self.DeadBedrooms,xdgzd,Potential Resurrection,16,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/xdgzd/potential_resurrection/,"I've been reading this sub for a while now, never posted (anywhere on reddit) and I have some good news to share.  I'll start with some background...

Wife (35) and I (34) have been married just over 6 years, together for 9.  We had a typical start to our relationship where we had sex every chance we got. The sex was awesome as we were both excited to experiment and try new things.  We both have a mild kinky streak so it was incredibly exciting.  Typical downturn in frequency over time, but we were both happy with our sex life.  

Our 2nd child was born in October of 2010 and after that is when the sex slowed to a crawl.  I blamed it on having two young kids and was bothered by it but thought it would get better as we became more comfortable with our new reality.  Turned out this wasn't the case.  She told me she was unhappy, falling out of love, etc.  This was the first wake up call and it happened about a year ago.  

I started to make changes but it still wasn't enough as we ended up going about 6 months without sex.  When we finally did, it was good but felt awkward to me. I ought about it and realized that it lacked the intimacy that I remembered.  

Two months later was my birthday and I didn't get laid and that was when I lost it.  We talked for a long time that night and that was the 2nd wake up call.  While our intimacy was improving (cuddling, hand holding, etc.) I still wasn't getting laid so I implemented more change.  Since then, we've had sex about 6 times (roughly once a month, most of those times happening in the last two months) but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  

About a month or two ago, she was watching '7 Days of Sex' on Lifetime when I got home from work.  She told me about the show and we watched it together.  She non noncommittally said that we should try it but did not say much else.  I of course wanted to proceed but I wanted it to come from her so that she owned it.  

Last Thursday night, she was at a fundraiser with a friend and came home a little late.  I had the girls showered and in bed and was ready to initiate.  When she got home, I was laying on the couch.  She laid on top of me and we kissed and she said again said that we should 7 days of sex and that we should start this weekend.  Needless to say I was very excited and appreciative of her effort and let her know as much.  

On Saturday we ended up having a surprise night alone as my in-laws decided they wanted the girls to spend the night.  Before anything happened, my wife gave me a coy, shit-eating grin and said we're still not starting til Sunday.  No problem I said. We went out and got home after midnight. After we walk in the door, my wife turns to me and says, 'you know, technically it is Sunday.' It was on like donkey kong.  

These are the things that I've done to improve our relationship:

* Be more of a team player.  I thought I was one but I was not holding up my end of the bargain in her eyes.

* Improved myself. I've been riding my bike to and from work and paying more attention to what I eat so I've lost about 20 pounds. Whenever I see someone I have not seen in a while, the compliments are flying which has done a great deal for my confidence. I also refocused at work and got a promotion that included a 30% raise.  

* Taking more responsibility. She has felt like the weight of our family was on her shoulders so I've been working on leading more than I have in the past. 

* More open communication. I'm horrible dealing with unpleasant things. I prefer to avoid it and hope it fixes itself or maybe I can fix a screw up before it gets really bad.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it blows up in my face. Turns out, it's better to acknowledge the problem and work on it together before it gets to the point of no return.

* More time for just us.  I'm always up for it but she often feels guilty leaving the kids because she travels a bit for work.  We have gone out of town for a night, had a number of date nights, etc.

We get into having some fun, and she can get really wet, but when it comes time for us to actually have sex, she's much too tight for me to get in, and it hurts her to try, so it's kind of put a damper on things. We can still fool around, but it's not quite the same as how close it feels to be so closely joined with her.

To elaborate on what it's like, she's so tight I have trouble getting two fingers in her, and I wear Trojan Magnums, and I just don't know what to do about it. I love her very much and she loves me, and I don't want to do anything to hurt her, so can anyone give me some advice?

So, we’ve been together for almost three years. I’m 22(f) and he’s 23. He’s my only sex partner ever, I’m his 3rd or 4th.  

The first 6months-year we had fairly regular, satisfying sex.

After that, it was steeply downhill, until the past 6 months in which there’s been absolutely no sex of any kind.

Starting the end of the first year, when the sex began decreasing, I’ve initiated conversations about it. I was told for the past two years that it’s “stress”. I was told the stressful situations would pass, he’d learn to manage time better, he’d find healthy ways to cope with stress, etc.

This answer was never satisfying, maybe because nothing ever did change, so I kept initiating conversations (every other month or so). Did he want something different from sex? Did he have issues with his looks? My looks? Health problems? Something else in the relationship? I tried everything I could think of, everything I’ve come across while researching this kind of issue. He always said it was stress, and that he would be less stressed at some point in the future. 

We talk about everything else, are very close, cuddly, and happy—except for this one issue. He never brings up sex, or starts any conversations about anything remotely related to sex, and as long as I’m not saying anything he seems perfectly happy until I bring it up again, when he apologizes and says he wants to have sex too. 

I’ve asked for an open relationship, either just me dating around or just him. If he needed to have sex with other people to get his libido back that’s fine with me at this point. If he doesn’t ever want a sexual relationship with me that’s fine, but I need it from someone else. He refuses both, begs me to “wait” until he figures himself out, and then everything settles down into sexless couple-hood again. 

I feel like his mother/sister at this point. We’re incredibly close, I love him and I know he loves me, we cuddle more than most family members might, but there’s no sex/sexual tension/passion. 

I guess what I’m asking is if anyone has been in a similar situation and found a solution? Has anyone gone to sex therapy for this type of thing? Is there anything I might be missing that could be causing the problem? 

And if this is all hopeless…
How important is sexual compatibility in the long run? If you have someone who is your best friend/family, do you leave him for sex? I’m going insane with out, but I can’t imagine leaving him.

I don't know where else to turn, and I have seen reddit give amazing advice in the past.

My boyfriend and I have been together for four years, and lived together for one. When I met him, he was a single male swinger (couples recruited him to have sex with the wives). He lost his virginity in a swinger situation. I am his first girlfriend. I am even the first person he ever kissed.

He and I are unbelievably happy together. He is affectionate and sweet, and makes it very well known that he loves me. We are both eccentric people, and we fit together on every level. Except with sex. About 5 months ago, he stopped having sex with me. I would initiate, and he would politely decline. The typical excuse is that he is too tired. We now have sex once or twice a month.

I am driving myself crazy trying to figure out what the problem is. It gets me down a lot, and I can't help but blame myself. I can't understand how he could fuck hundreds of women that he felt no emotion toward, but he can't have sex with the only person he has ever loved.

He says it is not my fault, it is his. He says he has no idea what is wrong with him. When I talk to him about it (typically when I have gone so long without sex that I fear I am going to just start humping inanimate objects), he is deeply apologetic and sometimes even cries, saying that I deserve better.

The ONLY reason he can come up with is that his history with swinging has caused him to have ""a fucked-up response to sex"", but he won't elaborate much on that. I have even, in a desperate attempt, offered to start swinging with him, if he wanted to go back to the lifestyle. He was visibly upset by that, said he loved me too much to share me, and that he never wanted to swing again.

Before anyone asks, I haven't gained weight. I have actually lost 20 pounds. Also, until recently, I have done everything I can think of to turn him on, and I have initiated sex every time for the last few months. I am starting to feel extremely unattractive, and mildly depressed and rejected. I can't get any sexual release because I can't masturbate without crying afterward, so I avoid that as much as possible.

Can anyone help me figure out what is going on?

My gf (23) and I (20) have been together for almost 3 years, and it's been a DB for the last 2/3 of that. 

The difference between most relationships I read about here and mine is that she's open to talking about the problem (talking in any detail about sex, however, makes her very uncomfortable), and she does want to improve the DB situation. I express how difficult this is for me, and she's empathetic of that. However, after almost 2 years of what I feel like should be some of the best sexual times of my life, not a lot has changed. Ever since she broke the floodgates of admitting to herself and me that she's averse to anything intimate, we still haven't had sex of any kind--even a kiss is a rarity. 

I'm soon graduating college and we've discussed moving in together, but I feel like I do not want to/should not make that step in an unsatisfactory relationship. 

After reading all the posts here, it seems like she's heading in the right direction (aware that it's a problem, wants it to change), but I don't know if anything is changing. I don't want to end up spending my life like this, and I see that it might be wise to get out while I can.

I know it's an anecdote, but here are the things I did:

* joined /r/NoFap -- while all the things on the list made a difference, this made more difference than you can possibly imagine.  Ultimately, it's what started the whole chain of events.  I would say, that if you have a DB and are fapping, start here.  Seriously.

* had ""the talk"" and listened

* joined /r/pornfree

I am 42(f) partner of 12 years is 62(m).  We met as I had just gone through a very messy divorce.... the sex was never great but I was fragile at the time and I never really paid attention. The alarm bells never rang in my head and looking back the signs were all there I just wasn't paying attention.

 We moved in together a year after meeting. Between us we had 5 children. Their ages when we first moved in together were  5 yr 9 yr 11yr 13 yr 22yrs... the two oldest being his from previous relationships. 

He was a good partner intelligent funny affectionate but also a workaholic. We both started new jobs/ business when we first moved in together and he would routinely work until 2 am in the morning leaving me alone at home from 7 pm ish.  Every night and most weekends he was at work. This went on for a number of years and even now he works some nights and virtually every Sunday night. 

Sex diminished until it was 3 times a year and then in the last 7 and half years we haven't had sex at all. Oral maybe once year but nothing in the last two years. I have lost all interest in even trying. 

He cannot maintain an erection. At first we tried counselling, then he went for a full medical, then we even bought 6 months worth of viagra as the doctor said he had low blood pressure and he needed to * practice * being hard. Nothing worked. Over the years it was an expensive soul destroying exercise that did not have any positive outcomes. 

He would constantly make excuses why we could never have sex.  When I challenged him on the subject he would become defensive and deny we had a problem or he would refuse to discuss it and promise me things would improve. He made it seem as if it was my fault - if only I would do this or not do that etc .. things would improve. 

In the last 7 years I have tried to leave him several times. I haven't for several reasons. My divorce was so traumatic I don't have the strength to go through something like that again and he has made it clear he wouldn't make it easy for me to leave. I have 3 children - its not that simple to just pack up and leave- he refused to move out of the house. I didn't want to put the children through another traumatic split and he is the only father my son remembers. 

I made him an offer to give him our home we had bought together, he could take my car, and I would move out with the kids Now 22 years 20 years and 16 years ( his two kids left long time ago ), he could sell the house and use the profit to pay for a small two bedroom flat cash.  He refused my offer saying that it wasnt enough and that he wanted someone to look after him. if the roles were reversed I would expect him to look after me.  

Financially his business hasn't done that well and I have paid a lump sum into it to avoid him being prosecuted for arrear taxes. I offered to release him from that loan as well. It still wasn't enough to allow me to have an amicable split.

if you take sex out of the equation - we actually get along really well most of the time. However its like living with my best friend I am beginning to look at him as a friend and as much as I love him I just don't love him in a sexual way. I am not attracted to him at all. 

I don't want to see him hurt, I just want to leave peacefully and amicable and find someone who is interested in me and not just the bank balance. 

In the last 7 years I have cheated on him with 3 separate guys. The first two was pure sex - it was like a stress reliever. Both one night stands purely physical approximately 5 years ago. I needed the affirmation that I could still be wanted.  I also had an active online cyber and phonesex life. It was the only way I could deal with having a cold bed.  Night after night alone I needed a distraction. I discussed the online chats with him and he told me to go for it. He didn't see it as cheating and if I enjoyed it then why not. I think he was relieved that I was being distracted elsewhere. I tried to open up the relationship physically but he wouldn't discuss it with me and once again kept promising me things would improve.  I have never told him about my two encounters.

Approximately two years ago I met a guy online. We became really close chatting every night for hours at a time. Phonesex daily. I eventually told him of my situation - he wasn't too happy about it but we continued to talk daily. I eventually bought a ticket and went out to see him for two weeks.  We hit it off straight away the sex was brilliant and it was incredibly hard to say good bye. We both live half a world apart. 

I am completely confused. I dont want to hurt my current partner, I dont want to put myself or my family through any more turmoil even though the divorce was 14 years ago. I want to be happy but I am not sure that is going to be practical as we live in different countries. My son has two years left of highschool then 3 years tertiary education - his real father is not in the picture and hasnt been for years. 

I am not sure if I am looking for advice - it just feels good to write it all out. 

Reading peoples stories here makes me realize I am not alone in this type of situation and my heart goes out to those who chose to stay. I just really do not know what to do anymore. 

Thanks for reading the wall of text ! .. hugs :)

I've been with my wife for over ten years now, and married for 4 of those. We're from different countries and met online. Relationship went well, and eventually it came down to who would move. She wanted to stay where she was so she could go to college full time. I wanted her to come live in my country for a few years first, but she didn't want to. So I moved to another country for her.

Fast forward to today. We've done oral and other things, but never penetrative sex. Sexual acts occur roughly every 2-3 months, and she never initiates. I know it's painful to attempt sex, so I haven't pushed it. She keeps saying she'll see a specialist or work on it, so far nothing has happened.

When I do make a move she'll say it tickles, or she'll just stop cold and say she's not interested. She won't touch me unless I've got a condom on, and even then she's not really enthusiastic about it. She'll peck me on the lips, but never anything more. When I try and give a bigger kiss she'll pull away.

She is a very sweet person, and we get on well, but there's just no spark. I mentioned that she'd never really been passionate, and she strong disagreed and said she did on vacation. That was five years ago, before we were even married. Every time we walk about the lack of sex (and we don't talk about it often) she says she'll work on it, or she cries.

I'm going to be 30 next year and I'm starting to wonder if staying together is actually worth it. The lack of sexual contact is starting to amplify my feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Part of me feels like I deserve it, because I knew she had a low libido when we first got together.

There’s so much I feel I need to write to give a proper perspective, so I’m sorry if its scattered. I also wasn't sure where to put this, but here dead bedrooms seems appropriate.

About me: I have a good career, I study, I work out regularly, I’m a hands on dad, I do my fair share of housework, I’m affectionate, communicative and a recovering “nice guy”. For some reason I’m also incredibly insecure and have some pretty big trust issues, which I’m working on.

About us: We have 2 kids together, have been together for about 5 years. We laugh together, have combined and separate hobbies. Everything with the relationship outside of the affection/sex you could say is perfect.

About her: She’s one of those bubbly fun people, that often gets mistaken for flirty, only she’s not like that at home, only in front of other people. It drives me crazy and she knows it. While I’m craving some PDA and getting nothing, she’s hanging off the shoulder of a some random guy. It’s gotten loads better from both our perspectives, but it’s still there.
Has trouble expressing herself in the bedroom, never masturbated at all, had quite a few sexual partners, but never orgasmed. Grew up under the notion that sex was dirty.

She was quite upset when she learned that I masturbated. She hates porn and is not open to toys, lights on or any position than the regular 2-3. The thing that gets me most is that she hates foreplay. It’s more of a “lets get this over with feel”, while I’m trying to always slow things down. Focus on her a little and feel I’ve been making progress. I think I’m well on my way to a g-spot orgasm for her, I can feel her walls tighten and she gets extremely wet, gooey eyed, bites my neck and pretty much loses control, but stops herself and moves my hands before the climax. Why, I don’t know, but she says that she’s focused on “getting there” so much that she’s too much “in her head” and not enough in “the moment”.

She is breast feeding, Recovered from Bulimia and a SAHM. She’s funny and generous, but here’s the crux. When things go wrong, she deals with it a few ways. 

Refuses to talk about it, for days at a time, Snaps and threatens to leave, usually in a torrent of abuse, or breaks down.

Naturally as a communicative guy I’m happy to talk about issues and problems, but sometimes it feels like I’m disarming a bomb in a furnace.

Onto the problem. I’m on my way to a dead bedroom. Our sex life has been the most confusing thing I’ve EVER dealt with. I’ve struggled with self esteem issues my whole life for one reason or another, so I can count my sexual encounters on one hand. However I know what I want and I’m quite open minded. At the start we were like a lot of people, at it like rabbits, but it was more than the frequency, she was “in to me”. After the first child, that seemed to change, where as we would still have sex, but there were “rules” attached. Don’t do this, don’t touch that, don’t look here, “I don’t do that anymore.”  She wanted another child and we fought a lot about it. I brought up issues with our current sex life, she promised to make an effort. For a while she was all over me and it was great, we fell pregnant again, gave birth and now it’s back to square one, only this time I’ve had a vasectomy so no more kids. I feel a little like I’ve fallen for bait and switch maybe?

Our sex life is back to vanilla, every night she says she’s too tired for anything and when we do do it. It feels like she’s just “checking off” another box. There’s little to no passion.

Story down, here’s what I need help with:

I want to bring the fun and intimacy back, I want there to be less “Rules”.
I want her to want me, does that sound stupid? I don’t want a hand job because it’s been a week and she feels guilty. I want her to pull me into the bathroom for a quickie here and there. I’ve been told I’m quite fit and handsome, but it all seems to go largely unnoticed. We used to wake up in the middle of the night for sex, but now if I try anything, my hands get smacked away. I read stories about guys being woken up in the night for sex and that’s NEVER happened to me, it makes me a sad panda.

I know she’s tired, but after working all day, the gym, study, kids, and housework, so am I!!! Even though I’m drained I could think of nothing better than settling down for some intimate time, but to her it’s just not a priority. 
She’s said that after being a SAHM, she just feels like I’m another set of hands picking at her, but nothing from my end has changed, if anything I try to be more “intimate”, with massages, candles, hair stroking, just giving her some time to herself, baths, days where I take the kids so she can have some alone time. I’ve tried to help out as much as I can, but it hasn’t changed anything.
I understand she obviously has self esteem issues, but I have no idea how to deal with this, I’m always reassuring and helped her through her eating disorder, and I thought we were past that. I have them too, I read books, I’ve had counselling, I’m always actively working on it.
I want to be able to talk about it. This is my biggest issue. As soon as I mention it nowadays, she just says “Oh here we go again”, or “I’m sick of talking about it”, we fight a bit, but nothing gets solved. She even said that because I talk about it so much “It makes her want it less.” So I leave it alone for a month and nothing changes. 

I’ve suggested couples counselling, but she says that there’s no point as “everything’s fine”. So I just go on my own, but it never resolves anything, I come home with some things to try and get stonewalled. 

I feel so frustrated, like I’m screaming, but she just can’t hear me or just doesn’t care. 

I feel I’ve doted on the negatives a lot here, but that’s just the points I want help with, there’s lots of good in this relationship, not to mention two kids, so it’s not something I can just leave lightly. I love this woman, perhaps too much. I once read you should never love a woman more than she loves you and certainly feel this is the case here. I mentioned this to her and she just said “Don’t change who you are, it’s who I fell in love with.”

Help me reddit. You’re my only hope.

Earlier this week I was shot down, because she didn't have the energy.  We went to bed, but then she ended up staying up for a couple more hours watching YouTube.  We talked about this, and she ""didn't have any energy, but she wasn't tired.""

After a couple years of that it became only at special times like birthdays or holidays like the 4th of July. 

I realized a couple years ago that it seemed she would only be receptive to my advances after she was very intoxicated.  We talked about sex a while back and she said she prefers to masturbate instead of sex with me (and men in general). The last time we've had sex was July of last year and she was super wasted and actually initiated sex. 

Fast forward a few months ago she confronts me saying she is not happy in our relationship and was ready to walk away.  She assumed I would get mad and kick her out!  I've always been very supportive of her and her needs, but mostly my courtesys go unnoticed.  She does not believe me or others when complimenting her.  We decided to go to counseling and have been making good progress exposing our issues. She suffers from anxiety and is depressed. She was on Zoloft before and went off for several months which our therapist thinks caused her to fall into her current depression. She is back on meds now, and I do feel that we will probably stay together, but she made a comment the other day in therapy that kinda freaked me out. She said that she could go the rest of her life without sex, and has no desire to have sex.  She also said that she's always felt used by men in regard to sex.  This gives me hope that when we resolve her anxiety and self image issues that the sex may return.  Am I being too optimistic?

If we do decide to divorce I'm afraid that I may never find someone to be with. I'm very athletic and not bad looking. But I have recently had surgery for testiclular cancer which resulted in the removal of both my testicles, and I'm worried that will possibly impact any future relationships as I fear that women will be turned off by that.  I've debated stopping my HRT to reduce my libido, but don't want to ruin my physique that I've worked so hard to achieve.

Not sure if I'm looking for specific answers or advice, just needed to share and hopefully get some honest feedback and support.

I've only had sex twice in three years and I'm trying to cope with it but it's really frustrating and hurtful!  He gives me a little to no attention at all not to mention cuddling in bed.  Anytime I TRY to be cute and grab him down there he pulls away and says no.  ""Can we cuddle naked in bed?"" He replies with ""I'm to tired and stressed out from work"".  I try to make him feel better by cooking, massaging his shoulders and feet, giving him Advil for pain. I'd do anything for him.  I give 100% of my love to him.  All I get in return is a kiss on the cheek when he gets home from work.  He'll come home from work, relax and hold his baby for 5 mins.  Then he'll put her down and play on the computer for hours then he'll ""go to the bathroom"" for 30mins to an hour.  He'll eat dinner, play on the computer more then go to bed.  

He rarely masturbates and show's no sign of being sexually active.  I don't think he's cheating on me, but maybe emotionally with another women, I'm not sure.  He says he loves me, but I'm not sure I buy it anymore.  Simply because he NEVER show's it!

Up until recently (3 or 4 months) I was pursuing and she was rejecting.  It has been almost a year since we've had sexual intercourse.

She couldn't tell me why and even therapy didn't help.  We've tried a bunch of different things, she's gone off birth control, we've lessened her stress, etc...

After a while I just gave up and basically started to ignore that part of my life.  I will give her enough time during the week to make her happy and then I will go do my own thing.  I take care of myself when I need to and that's about it.

I don't bring it up or talk about.  When she does I just agree that it's not happening and move on.

So now she's told me that she wants to start trying again.  I don't know how I feel about this.  I'm almost ambivalent...I feel like I can't put much stock into her words because it hasn't meant anything in this arena lately.  

I think I'm mad as well.  I'm mad that I've had to wait and wait for her to say let's do it...and now when she's ready I don't know if I want to.    

I know I definitely don't want to initiate.  I refuse to be rejected anymore.

Maybe I'm just being passive aggressive, I don't know.  I'm having trouble sorting out the feelings in my head.  It's like I boxed them away and now she's trying to open them up again.  

All I know is that I absolutely refuse to feel out of control about sex anymore.  I feel like she's lost the right to access that part of me until I feel like this is something that will become part of our life again.

We used to have a great sex life, we had sex multiple times a week, despite both of our busy work and school schedules.  Our libidos didn't always line up, but when I wasn't in the mood I was still game to give him ""freebies"", or little quickies where I would do what he wanted and he wouldn't need to reciprocate (as long as the sessions didn't last for hours on end).  So I feel like I never left him without sex for too long. 

We got married and things began changing, we fought more, one day after an argument wasn't resolved, we were going to have sex.  Rather than being able to go with it I wasn't in the mood and after I had agreed to going forth, I changed my mind.  Likely I would have give him a freebie the next day, but I was just too upset.  

That's when the really bad trouble started.  He withheld ANY kind of affection for 3 months on end, all the while denying that anything was bothering him when I would try to talk it out.  I was befuddled, I just didn't understand what was happening.  He worked out with female friends frequently, and once came home 4 hours after work, claiming to have been working out the whole time.  I began to think he was being unfaithful.

Fastforward to months later, he gets furious when I show any kind of distrust or disbelief towards his being faithful and claims that the 3 month period without sex was all due to that one time that I rejected him.  

Now, anytime I have anything that needs to be addressed or talked about whatsoever, he gets angry and withholds sex for weeks or months on end.  I feel like I can't express the way that I feel at all, about anything, because he punishes me in this way.  He has begun to make negative comments about the way I look, and has said he doesn't love me anymore.  He doesn't apologize for saying these things at all.  

I feel so angry and hurt by his behavior.  I've begun to seriously consider having an affair with the devastatingly handsome guy in my class.  I've never been unfaithful to ANYONE.  This type of behavior isn't me.  But I'm tired of feeling unattractive, neglected, frustrated, and taken for granted by him.

Both our sex drive and sex ""tastes"" were mismatched from the beginning. It was an early warning sign and I'm sorry I ignored it. But it's too late now.

We are good friends, and I basically feel like I have a pretty decent housemate. We don't really talk in depth, and previous attempts to discuss sex have ended acrimoniously.

A complicating factor is that one of our children is severely disabled. His care takes up a lot of time and his sleep patterns are often broken. It is not unusual for us to go for weeks with one or both of us getting no more than 4 hours (broken) sleep a night.

My libido goes up and down anyway and when it's down I don't really miss it. When it's up I get frustrated. So I'd like to take medication to make sure it goes down and stays down. I figure if I don't feel like sex I won't miss it, therefore won't get frustrated, and therefore won't resent the lack of sex.

I know some SSRI anti-depressants do this, I've experienced that side effect when I was on them a long time ago. Has anyone else considered using drugs to lower their libido so that they stop minding the dead bedroom?

For whatever reason, I don't really like sex.  One, it's damn painful, and two, I'm fairly uncomfortable with my own body.  I'm slim, I'm attractive, so it's not that.  I don't know what it is.  I abhor being naked and truth be told I do not like being touched.  


Anyway it all became a problem early in the relationship.  We  would go through periods where we didn't have sex often, and I didn't take my clothes off when having sex.  At first I'll admit I truly didn't understand how important sex was to people so it didn't seem like a big deal to me.  Eventually he got really mad and began expressing how upset it made him.  So I worked damn hard to try and fix this.


I believe he underestimates exactly how difficult it was for me to work on these issues and I think he began taking advantage of my trying to fix the problem.  For example, I started having sex with him about 3 times a week.  I will stress that I did not enjoy these times, and I did them simply to make him happy.  Then it got to the point where he'd bring up, ""can we have sex tonight?""  and if I didn't want to, it was a fight, he would bring up how I'm fucked up with sex, I don't enjoy it, etc.  Another example, he would ask me and ask me to sleep without my clothes on next to him.  I prefer sleeping with clothes on.  Anyway I finally did this one night, and then every fucking night after that he woudl ask to the point it wasn't worth his nagging and I would just do it.  But to him, if I rejected sex, or slept with my clothes on that was me just ""getting my way"".  I don't even like thinking of these fights.  


We broke up a few months ago, and while I missed him, to be honest I was so damn relieved a) not having to have sex (if he brought it up and somehow got me to agree for it that night, then the whole day would be kind of ruined for me personally because I knew there was no turning back at that point and I would die a little inside antiticpating it) and b) not hearing him nag me or get in fights any time  Ididn't seem enthusiastic about sex things


Recently he said he wants to work it out.  He apologizes and says he appreciates all I did to fix our problems.  During the relationship he would tell me thanks here and there, thank me profusely for working so hard to fix thengs.  Then here and there he would turn around and say ""this is shit, how can I live like this.""  He says any time I don't seem excited like sex that I don't understand what it's like to be rejected and how he would never turn me down.  He's right, maybe I don't get that, but I don't think he understands what its like to force yourself to have sex with someone to the point you just fixate at plaster on the wall to try and forget what you're doing and forget the physical pain its causing just so you can get through it and fucking pray for it to end


The rest of our relationship was great but this was so terrible.  I don't feel I could ever go back to forcing myself again.  It's not that I'm asexual either.  I don't know.  I was just sitting here picturing having to have sex again, or forcing myself rather, and the whole thought just made me shiver.   I never really saw how big sex problems were until I started reading internet forums like reddit and seeing people want to leave their relationshis over it, etc.  I wanted to change to help our relationship because of this, but I feel I tried so hard that I have 0 motivation to go through it again now

Granted, it has only been two weeks since our last encounter, but things have happened. I tried to give him a blow job (he readily accepted it) but he couldn't get off due to being on pain medication, and even though I went for an hour, he kept going limp. Frustration ensued. The next night, I tried to get him off manually and once again, limpness happened, and I got mad-- I kind of ruined it. I asked him how hard it was for him to reciprocate and he hasn't mentioned sex/blowies since, save for grabbing my ass once when I bought some new lacy underwear that I wore to bed.

Sigh.

We had a conversation in the kitchen the other day about ben-wa balls, as I told him that I ordered some after I noticed the other day when I was riding him as he was laying there that he wasn't paying attention, just watching the television. He said ""I wouldn't mind if your vagina was tighter"" and without harsh words or accusations, I got it out of him that he thinks that my vagina is basically too big. I've had a child, yes, but the thing is, you guys-- my vagina *isn't* too big. I had trouble putting those ben-wa balls in when they got here, and even though the directions say to flex your PC muscles to keep them from falling out, they wouldn't fall out, even with me pushing them out. Part of me thinks, because of who he is, he is blaming errors with my body on the fact that he's not sexually attracted to me in ways, but part of me wants to hop on down to the plastic surgeon, book and appointment for vaginal rejuvenation and breast implants, and to, you know, hope for the best. I know that's not logical, but my self esteem is already waning, and I've stopped consciously eating when I'm hungry, instead relying on water and cigarettes for most of my sustenance. I know it's not healthy, but shit, I feel like my self worth is plummeting.

So, this leads on to my next idea for discussion, mostly for the ladies, but for the men too;

Do you feel, sometimes, that it's you? That you're not attractive or something is *wrong* with you? How is your self esteem? Do you ever blame yourself?

I've read pages and pages of posts in this Reddit about men and women not wanting sex.  Yet, I don't think I've read any where the women are in menopause or had hysterectomies or the men are in andropause.

Most of the ages listed are young - 20's etc.  So, I'm trying NOT to infer anything, but here are some things to think about.

POF:  Premature Ovarian Failure.  I know quite a few women in their 20's that experience this.  They stop producing Estrogen and Testosterone which is what gives us our libidos.

Natural Menopause:  as a woman enters this, her hormone levels drop usually over time.  Testosterone is what fuels our sex drives: desire, arousal, ability to lubricate and orgasm.  Estrogen is a part of the mix in that it gives us help in the lubrication area.

Surgical Menopause:  Menopause hits us as if we were slammed up against a wall.  

The symptoms for natural and surgical can be and often are debilitating.  Hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness, brain fog, loss of libido, urinary problems, bone loss, anxiety, depression, dry vagina, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, joint pain, physical and mental exhaustion, difficulty sleeping.

Some some experience all and some just a few.

Andropause:  Testosterone levels start dropping when a man hits 40.  However, young men can also have low testosterone levels.  This is what fuels libido in men.  Symptoms can be: blunted motivation, decreased libido, decreased ability to become erect or loss of erection, decreased orgasmic response, depression, diminished feeling of well being, fatigue, incontinence, low energy, memory problems, mental fuzziness, muscle weakness, etc.

I think that any man or woman should get blood work done to see what their Estradiol (estrogen), Free, Total Serum and % Free Testosterone levels are if they are experiencing any of these symptoms.  If the levels are low, then that can be an helped/fixed IF the person is willing to do that.  

How do I know all this?  I had a hysterectomy in 1987.  No doctor told me about the benefits of Testosterone and libido.  I went for 16 years with no libido.  I had sex, but that was to make my husband (at the time) happy.  I didn't hate it, it just didn't do anything for me.

About 8 years ago, I read a newsletter from my new gynecologist about Bioidentical Hormone subcutaneous Pellets, composed of estrogen or testosterone.  They are about the size of a grain of rice.  I get them inserted in my hip.  Within 48 hours, my libido came roaring back like a freight train.

I became passionate about helping other women like me.  I have a Yahoo group about the pellets with over 400 women and a few men.  One member is also a pharmacist that owns a pharmacy that makes the pellets.  I have personally helped over 100 women find doctors that do the pellets all over the states and as far away as New Zealand.  I get emails weekly thanking me for saving their marriages and lives.  These women come to me desperate for information about finding help.  Many of the women in my group are in their 20's and suffering from POF.

I've since gotten divorced and just married a wonderful man this fall.  He's 60 and I'm 58.  His testosterone level last spring was about 300.  He got 1200mgs of testosterone pellets inserted in his hip and all I can say is WOW!  He's like he was when he was in his 20's.  We make love  4-5 times per week, sometimes 2-3 times in one day.  Weekdays are a little void...work etc.  But we sure make up for it on the weekends.

His pellets last between 5-6 months.  Mine last anywhere from 12 -16 weeks.

Besides the above, there are so many medications that cause loss of libido:  BC, blood pressure meds, I think some cholesterol can, anti-depression meds.  Then add kids, work, financial problems, the list goes on....sex is the last thing one thinks about.

If it's relationship based, no amount of hormones will help.  But get them checked first.  Rule that out.  Then you have a better idea of what you are dealing with.

Guys,  I get emails from men about their wives when they've searched hormones and found one of my posts in various menopause/hysterectomy sites.  This is how I help men understand when their SO is going through menopause and loss of libido.  I compare it to a car.  Estrogen is the oil and Testosterone is the gas.  If the car is empty of both, no matter how much you want the car to go, it won't. You can beg, plead, get mad, walk away, and just quit, it's not going to go.  You can press on the gas pedal (clitoris) forever and it's not going to go (orgasm).  But....put the right amount of oil and gas in the car and watch it take off!  Even if the car has gas, but no oil, it's not going to go.  Same with the reverse...no gas and lots of oil?  Still no go.  It's the balance of the two.   This actually applies to both men and women as men have E and T as well as women.  

So is it possible that any of what I've written might apply to your situation?  If so, I'll be glad to tell you how to find out information.

Well, that's it for now.  I'm happy to answer any questions about this.    

FYI...  I make no money, have no financial interests or benefits from talking about the pellets.  They have to be inserted by a doctor and the doctor has to purchase the pellets from a compounding pharmacy.  I'm not in the pharmaceutical or medical industry.

My bf and I have been together for 2 years, when we first started dating, I was all about the sex, as I typically am when a relationship is new and exciting. Now in every other relationship I've been in, I lost interest in the sex after a few months and ended the relationship. However, this time around, I lost interest in the sex, but I am still very much in love with my boyfriend and quite content.

Anyway, after the new and exciting period, sex was 2-3 times a week, then it gradually slid down to once a week, and now we're looking at a couple times a month. And it's almost entirely my fault, he wants it pretty much every night, but I am a full time student and I also have a full time job. I am constantly stressed/exhausted, and I feel horrible because I'm rejecting him nightly. 

I think part of the issue is that the times when I do want sex tend to be during the day, this presents an issue because even though I work from home, he usually has class at these times. The other issue is that he won't have sex with me until I get off first. I realize this sounds wonderful, but when I'm really tired and he's wanting sex, I know it will take some time, and I would really just rather sleep. And it's not just that he won't have sex with me, but he won't be able to get it up unless I have gotten off. 

Anyway, I'm frustrated because I know he has to be unhappy about the lack of frequency, and I WANT to want sex more, but I don't really know what to do.

I plan on starting to work out every morning next quarter, not due to weight issues, just for the added energy and the supposed boost to libido, but I could certainly use some advice.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_nisq2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/nisq2/opposite_perspective_of_most_here/,

I have been the cause of bed death in every relationship I've ever had.  From the time I started having sex at 16, I always had a very low libido.  In the context of past relationships, I would have sex because I loved my partner and wanted to give him/her pleasure and because I liked the emotional intimacy that comes with sex.  However, I almost never craved sex for myself.  If I disregarded my partner's needs, I would be perfectly satisfied with having sex once a month at the most.  I'd always make an effort to meet my partner's needs, but sex was a chore, and that fact contributed heavily to the demise of all of my relationships.


I had all but accepted that my whole future would be a sexless existence, but in the past week, my vagina woke the fuck up with a vengence.  All of a sudden, I'm drooling over guys on the street (when I've only ever been emotionally attracted to men - never physically), I'm thinking dirty thoughts anytime anything comes remotely close to stimulating me (innocently cross my legs in Chem lecture and my mind immediately goes from electrons to vibrators because the seam on my jeans brushed against my clit a tiny bit), and today I spent almost all day masturbating because my vagina would not shut up and leave me alone.  Is this what it's like to be a 14 year old boy?


The only thing that changed in the past week is that I've stopped taking Effexor (under a physician's supervision).  I always knew that anti-depressants could kill a person's libido, but because I had always had a low libido, I figured the meds probably weren't to blame.  I'm now realizing that because I started taking anti-depressants at 14, before my sexual maturity had really developed, I never had the opportunity to get a baseline reading of what might be normal for me without the meds.  I also figured that since I've changed the particular type of anti-depressant I take so many times with no effect on my libido, the two must not be related, but they all have decreased libido as a side effect.


I'm 25 now, single, and I feel like I've been robbed of a decade of my sexuality, but I'm hopeful.  I think my horniness will calm down a bit as the effects of withdrawl subside, and then I can finally be myself in bed.  I'm really excited to see what happens the next time I start seeing someone special.

Our relationship started on a basis of a lot of shared interests, but he made it pretty clear from the start how important sexual compatibility was, and that he had a high sex drive, which I certainly shared. It started off hot and heavy, we'd have sex maybe twice a day that we spent together, we'd exchange sexy messages a lot, etc.

But in the last month, we've had sex twice, and once I felt like I was just getting pity sex. He makes sexual advances and when I begin to reciprocate, he pulls away and remembers something he was going to do/show me on youtube/whatever. Sex is now a bed-time only event, and most of the time we spent the night together, he starts to get steadily depressed a couple of hours before going to bed, meaning sex is a no. I try to be as supportive, as understanding as I can, but he's resistant to even talking about it. 

Any time I try to make an advance, he immediately denies it. I sent a sexy message, or text, it's shot down. I kiss him when he seems happy, I continue suggesting more, he wants to stop. 

I've begun to feel like there must be something about *me* that's causing this. I already have borderline personality disorder, so it's driving me crazy. I'm also kind of fat, so I think ""he must find me hideous, but he's not leaving me because I'm the only girl who's willing to spend time with him and show him affection."" In our entire relationship, he's only given me a couple of compliments. Every night we've spent together for the last month or so, I've lay awake for hours after he's rejected me. I don't feel like it's going to get any better any time soon, and I don't want to have to make the decision that's lingering in the back of my mind if this continues.

Don't really know what else to say, it's been eating at me for a while and I have no one else to talk to about it :(.

**Edit**: That's for support/suggestions.

I talked to my bf today, I couldn't conceal my anxiety over the situation and he asked what was wrong. I explained how I feel insecure about our lack of sex life. He said he feels inexplicably depressed and doesn't have any urge to even masturbate. He said he also feels worried I'm going to leave him and it makes him too anxious to become aroused. I asked him if he's just depressed *now* or if this is a recurring theme in his life, he responded the latter. I suggested he seek medical help, either counselling, meds, preferably both, as well as checking his blood for any deficiencies that might be causing a lower mood. It took me a long time to convince him that feeling down and seeking help doesn't make him 'pathetic' or a 'woman'.",,False,,t5_2t25p,True,,,True,t3_lzw8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/lzw8m/6_months_in_and_our_sex_life_is_dying/,

It is a long distance relationship (recently closer, thankfully), and so times for intimacy are few and far between. Before it would be multiple times a day for the one weekend we would see each other a month. Then once a day that weekend. Then once a visit. Then.....nothing. Fortunately now we are close enough to spend almost every weekend and some weeknights together, still nothing....maybe twice a month if I'm lucky.

I know that guys aren't constantly ready to go, but to wind down this much? I have expressed my concerns in every way imaginable, starting really subtly, trying to initiate more (which is difficult because I am naturally submissive in the bedroom). It recently developed into a full-blown yell match on my part. I don't know what else to do. I am open to so many things and want to try so many things during this period for exploration in our lives (nothing crazy, just places other than a bed, incorporating ""vanilla"" toys, etc) but now I'm just hoping for ANYTHING.

He cares for me a lot when we do have sex, he makes sure I am taken care of. This is more a question of quantity, not quality per se. (However, I get one oral session per every, oh I don't know, 25 bjs? I have expressed concern over this as well, and have tried to be as helpful as possible)

Now today I was watching some pretty vanilla porn trying to take care of myself instead, and I couldn't. I couldn't watch it. I couldn't enjoy it anymore. Those people on screen were so lucky to have someone that wanted to be with them. I was so jealous of them. Even the degrading type of sex seen in so much porn seems crazily appealing now, but I can't even watch that. So now I can't even get myself off because of this frustration.

I'm so embarrassed of myself. I have always felt myself ""normal"" sexually, but now I am really starting to doubt that. His attitude towards this situation is starting to make me feel like I'm some weird nympho that should be ashamed that I want the things that I want. I have told him this too. I have been so open and accommodating, now I am just at a loss.

Not really looking for advice, I just had to tell something/one.

We have had a great sex life up until a few months ago.  I stay with him at his place every two weeks when I don't have my kids and we have had a lot of fulfilling sexual fun/intimacy during those times. It actually keeps me going when I'm not with him and am missing him.  He has taken a LOT of pictures of me for his own use on-line as he likes to share them with other men. He loves to masturbate on-line with them to my pictures.  I have never minded this so much, but now it's gotten to the point that this is all he does anymore. (every day, sometimes twice a day) By the time I get to his place, he's had all his fun and doesn't have anything left for me. He even tells me about the fun he's having when he gets on-line.  I'm starting to get the impression that he prefers my pictures over me.  Yes, I've said something and he denies it, then gives me all the excuses. (tired, stressed etc) I've told him I feel left out, lacking the sexual intimacy.  I've gone as far as just taking his hand and placing it in my pants.  That worked....for about 10 minutes.  It just seemed like he wanted to get it over with so I would stop hounding him for sex.  Hence the reason the whole sex act lasted MAYBE 10 minutes. (this was 2 weeks ago) I have pretty much given up and am reserved in the fact that he prefers jacking off to my pictures with other men than he does having sex with the real me at this point.  We share an acct on-line and I go as far as watching his convo's from my computer just so I can be a part of it. It feels really pathetic when I do.

I come over, we have dinner and hang out for a bit then it's off to bed to sleep.  He shows NO sign of wanting me and I'm starting to feel frustrated and lonely.  What am I doing wrong?  Should I go and take all my pictures back?  That doesn't sound right to me, sounds like I'm parenting him.  I've asked him to try and refrain from getting himself off on weekends I will be with him, but he just looks at me like I have two heads and keeps on doing what he's doing.

I know passion inevitably dies out, at least a bit, but I feel like this happened too quickly. After barely 2 months, and up to now, we've been having sex once a week or worse.

I've tried talking to her about it several times. The first time didn't go too badly, and I thought headway was made. Nothing changed. The second time was more difficult, in a ""oh so we're back to this"" way, but she promised things would change. At the time she was just finishing up with college and was understandably stressed, especially when you consider she's also got kids to look after, no money, etc. So I tried my best to be understanding and dropped the issue, waiting to see if anything really would change. Things picked up for a week: we had sex thrice! In the same week! Omg! That was what, two months ago? It's been back to the usual since then.

While the frequency *is* a problem for me, it's hardly a deal-breaker, and I totally understand why she's hardly ever in the mood. Several things concern me much more:

* She never initiates sex, even when I don't for more than a week
* She now absolutely refuses to talk about it (or any problems, really)
* When we do have sex, she's too tired / not in the mood halfway through

Another thing: she'll be flirty and teasey all day, rubbing and wiggling herself on me playfully, joking around, groping, etc., but come evening she's not in the mood. I've tried initiating during the day when she's doing any of the above, only to get turned down.

I don't know what to think, really. Despite her assertions otherwise, I feel like she's bored of me, or our sex life, or she doesn't find me attractive -- all the usual things one would think, I suppose. I'm often suggesting new things for us to try, and she's been happy to try everything so far, but it hasn't made any difference, so presumably spice isn't the answer?

I'm just sick of feeling rejected and unwanted, and I don't know what else to do besides ask you lovely people for advice.

High school sweet hearts and all that (Freshman/Senior), but hey we're still together. Most of our trials have just come from typical ""growing up"" shit, earlier age gap (like when I was 21 or over and she wasn't yet), quarter life crisis's (education and starting careers and adulthood), and the ""7 year itches"" (what if...). Somehow, through lots of bumbling around in the dark, we've made it to year 12 and decided that we very much want to get married.

Our bedroom isn't exactly dead, which makes me nervous about posting here in light of more dire issues from other posters, but we definitely have bedroom problems that I really want to address, but am really not sure how.

We have sex 3-4 times on a good week, and maybe 0-1 during a bad two weeks. My libido is seemingly MUCH higher than hers. I seem to be willingly and ready almost all the time and get turned on very easily. She, however, doesn't really have much interest in sex. She enjoys the sex we have, once we get started, and orgasms regularly (most of the time at least twice), but if my penis isn't in her then she isn't interested. I am thankful that she actually lets us have sex as much as we do considering she has such a low libido.

The actual problem comes in the the form of as follows. I had a paragraph, but I think if I split it into bullet points, it will make it easier.

- She gets sore anywhere between 5-15 minutes into sex, and I tend take a bit longer to get my jollies. This puts a lot of pressure on me ""get off"" as quick as I can so it doesn't become painful for her.

- Playing ""beat the clock"" is very disconnecting because I have to imagine all the stuff that turns me on. It ends up feeling like I'm masturbating.

- She has lubrication issues, which are certainly adding to the issue of her becoming sore.

- She doesn't like to use lube to the point of being disgruntled if I try to force it's use.

- She doesn't like foreplay. Oral sex on her gets me scolded. Touching her sexually is sometimes tolerated for 30 seconds to a minute. She will, on occasion (once every couple months), give me a little oral before sex.

- She doesn't enjoy heavy kissing. Kissing heavily will only last about a minute tops before she has to turn her head from me because she feels claustrophobic.

- Positions other than missionary or doggy are a rarity. She prefers not to be on top because she gets tired after a minute or so. She prefer to lay back and let me work. Any more ""exotic"" positions are only achieved in the middle of very hot sex, but with the time limit and the rarity that she is actually so caught up in the sex to allow it is another big rarity.

- She usually has to say ""No"" to sex first before she will say ""yes"". This means I try to initiate by being kissy and fondling, even try a more direct approach, and I'm shrugged off. About 5 minutes or so later, she will drop her pants and say ""alright, come on"". It majorly deflates the whole experience for me.

- When asked, she cannot give me an answer to what actually turns her on. She doesn't know... When she IS turned on in the odd occasion though, she can have sex for quite a long time. Very frustrating.

- There have been times when she gets crazy in bed, is horny, grinds on me, and attacks my face with her mouth. Way awesome! All of these times, however, have been when we were on the outs or separated entirely (make up/break up sex). The pattern I've seen is that she is far more open and free with her body when she is trying to get me (or someone else) to like her. Like having sex with me when she's not sure if I'll be there tomorrow actually seems to get her wet. **This is the only thing I've seen to actually turn her on**. Good information to know, but I have no way to reproduce this in a healthy manner. This awesome sex behavior usually only last about 2 weeks before it mellows back to the usual. There is also the very rare anomaly of her being really horny for no perceivable reason, which only tells me that it *can* happen but still have no idea how. She doesn't know either. "" I just was"" is her answer.

- Talking to her about it is embarrassing for her and usually leads to a very distracting argument about more abstractly related subjects. She doesn't not handle guilt well and is the type to be angry at others for making her feel guilty. This, again, makes the subject difficult to talk about in a constructive manner. It's hit or miss.

- She knows I'm not satisfied, and so she feels pressured to perform. This understandably makes her uncomfortable.

- She does not masturbate. There is inherently nothing wrong with this, but her self exploration is highly limited. She has a hard time expressing what she does like, and just doesn't like what she's not familiar with. She doesn't want to start masturbating because it makes her feel awkward.

- **EDIT** - Adding another point that is pretty important. She was date-raped 10 years ago during one of our ""off periods"". Not violently, but through intimidation/fear and lack of control of the situation. This, in my mind, is a major contributor to her knee-jerk reaction to control our sex. Hence the ""No"" then ""yes"", the lack of trust and comfort with different positions and likely overall anxiety with sex itself.

We (well I) developed a system to help us a little less than a year ago. She never initiated and felt pressured to initiate, and I felt undesired because she never initiated and always deflated the sex before we even got down to it. The system was simple. She was never allowed to say ""No"". If I initiated, she just had to go with it and make the best. It actually really worked. It took away the pressure of her having to initiate because I felt all manly taking my woman whenever I wanted. It made me ask for it less because I knew I could get it on my time instead of being unsure when I'd ever get it (less/no begging), I also had to be considerate to her soreness (giving her a appropriate time in between sessions to recover, usually 24+ hours). It also made her wonder when I was going to pounce on her. Every second we were in each other's presence and I wasn't attacking her, she was wondering when I would. It had the great side affect of making her think about sex a lot more and helping her get a little more turned on and get less sore.

We eventually, unfortunately, fell off that horse during a perfect storm of her menstruation, holidays with the family, getting a really nasty flu, and stress. We have been unable to get back on that horse through a couple attempts.

We verbally compliment each other often. I tell her she is sexy (and she is) but she has self image issues that make her feel unsexy. I'm not sure how to boost her confidence if my pawing and drooling isn't enough. 

I want to reiterate that breaking up and finding someone else isn't constructive right now. We've both slept with other people and aren't interested in sleeping with anyone else, we are very in love with each other and otherwise compliment each other well. Each of our weaknesses are counter by each others strengths. What I want to do is work on this one area of an otherwise great relationship.

I wanted to wait until marriage, we were both virgins.  One night we were fulling around, and she got aggressive, we had talked about having sex but I still wanted to wait. I wanted to wait because I have high testosterone and knew I would want it everyday, and we don't have the luxury of seeing each other that often.
  So we have sex and its great, we start making love four sometimes five nights a week, two or three times every night we engage. After a two months she went home for Christmas break, we didn't see each other for two weeks, and after our romping started to chill out.  I knew it was coming and didn't think much of it.  We would still get all tangled up one or two nights a week.  However, even that didn't last long it kept getting further and further apart and around February it just stopped happening.  I kept trying and trying but, no luck.  I finally started to get depressed and not feeling like a man.  So I stopped trying. Just around her birthday in April, we had sex, and it was great.       Since then, however, nothing.  She says she wants to, she is just never really in the mood for sex.  We still fool around and do oral, but, never sex.  I'm starting to feel like less of man.  I mean after all, what kind of man can't get his women all fired up.  Typing this I can feel emotion building up and believe me, thats not who I am.
  Sorry for the wall of text but I was wondering if anyone has felt my pain, or have any idea what is going on.  I know she isn't having an affair, I don't know how, but I know she isn't.  Any help would be great, because, honestly I don't know what to do or where to turn...

This is just a rant and it may seem like random gibberish because I'm stressed and can't get my words out as I would like too.

I'm 23 HL, my gf is 33 LL. We've been together for 4 and a half years now and I think the last time we had sex was somewhere between 1 to 2 months ago and the last time we had sex when she was sober is a lot longer. I gave up initiating sex 10 months ago and have only had sex when she has been drinking a lot; which always ends up as just bad sex, not enjoyable at all. Just try to get it over and done with and then go do whatever I would normally do while she passes out. When she has been sober, she just doesn't seem like she wants to be there, it's always me doing everything until she decides she wants to get on top. She always has her eyes shut, sex almost always starts with her facing away from me and me having to do everything while she just lays there. She very very very rarely gives/receives oral which she will stop after a few minutes and she won't try anything else...at all.

We've talked a lot about her LL over the years and have argued about it far to many times to count. She says I put to much pressure on her. She doesn't make any effort to do anything intimate with me, including, kissing and cuddling and it is always down to me to do anything. She also moans to me about how I don't try, don't kiss her, don't be close to her and want to do things with her. She absolutely hates it when I say that it doesn't bother me when we aren't intimate, this is after trying and trying to have nothing happen again and again being turned down and rejected constantly and just giving up. She will make everything out to be my fault and in most arguments we have I have to walk out and leave the house because otherwise I have to spend hours arguing if I don't just agree with everything she says. When I come back she will then start the argument all over again so in the end I have just left a gap of time between another stupid argument which in the end I just have to bow down and agree to whatever she says otherwise it will not end. 

Other than that the relationship has been fine for the most part. spending time together, going out, etc. I'm just getting to the point where I want out (Not for the first time) but am stopped by lack of funds to get my own place. I couldn't go back to my family as I hate being with them for more than a day because they stress me out so much and have no friends who I could ask. I have recently started a new job which may allow me to get my own place but there is a very big possibility of the hours going down so I would be stuck in a sexless and stressful relationship or living with my family who I'd just want to throttle every single day.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1hvcri,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hvcri/just_a_rant/,

As someone whose physical touch score on 5lovelanguages is so low it's actually 0, and generally has very low libido, how do I keep up?

As someone with LL reading posts in this subreddit, it feels pretty awful knowing that any of the things people complain about in here could apply to me. I don't deny that it probably feels terrible being the one constantly rejected in the bedroom and feeling unwanted/unattractive because of it, but it's pretty bad being on the other side too. The choice often seems to be between just saying no and going to sleep and then being resented for it, or trying hard to get into it and then ultimately just laying there taking it and waiting for it to be over.

Through counselling and and a lot of practice communicating, our situation has improved. Although her libido hasn't improved, she's become willing to have sex more frequently in order to keep my happy. For so long this is what I thought I wanted - to be able to have sex with my wife. I should be happy, right ? Well, I've discovered that what I really want, is to be wanted. It makes you feel pretty shitty if the only person in the world you have sex with doesn't want you.

More tears, from complete exhaustion. I have enough with story time and send everyone to their rooms. Exhausted at all the fighting I wonder if my husband still feels like doing the nightly routine watching a show or movie with the usual couch / floor seating arrangements. So while I am sitting in the dark waiting for him to show he seemly take forever. Finally I head up just to see if maybe the fighting was his limit too. He's fiddling with his phone and says he's resting and I should go see a movie with my friends... They had called earlier in the day. I had not responded. He says he's just too tired too exhausted to do anything. Just wants to go to bed. So I go. I come home and he's wrapped up as if he has been asleep yawns as I turn on the bathroom light and acts as if he has been asleep this whole time. So as I look over there it is clear as day. A giant load off his side of the bed. Obviously still fresh and dripping. So I say ""the least you can do is clean it up. I'm sick of stepping in it everyday. I can't be asked to clean it myself.""

So how can we have a double standard. Obviously he has the desire. But obviously it's not me. Maybe it's time to let each other go???  
Problem is he's the only guy I have ever really truly loved. He is the only guy I actually want. I don't want anyone else. It may sound stupid and it may sound idiotic but I want him. I want him to want me. But obviously he doesn't. Obviously I've had other options. But what am I to do about it?

* Do I just lay it out there tell him I'm lying about being able to deal without?  
* Do I let him know I have to suppress my own desires multiple times a day and satisfy my own urges?
* or even that I'm contemplating leaving? For real this time!
* Do I come out with him about my other activities to suppress my urges?  

I don't have a damn clue! 

TL:DR- FRICKIN double standards suck!

  Ten years and one child later we do not have sex at all. We have not kissed in years. We have had sex maybe 3/4 times in 2 years and when we did it was shockingly crap. He requires at least 45 minutes of blow job/foreplay and then lasts about five mins tops for actual sex. When we are having the sex he insists on changing position repeatedly like we are in some kind of cheap, badly edited porno. I have explained repeatedly that my clitoris is on the outside and that I need constant stimulation for more than 30 seconds to come. When we first started having sex I was so turned on by him that I would come very quickly/easily, with minimal foreplay and maybe 10/15 mins sex.

These days he will not give me any foreplay at all, it is all about him. The whole experience makes me feel like an unpaid hooker. He will not even give me a back rub or sit close to me. The last time I initiated sex I made the mistake of saying 'have you got a condom' whilst touching his penis and when he could not get an erection he blamed it on the fact that I said the word 'condom'. I mean, really?????  I am now having to use porn on a regular basis just to take care of my needs, I have not masturbated this much since I was a teenager.

 I crave human contact and have seriously considered an affair. Because of the situation with our child, financially I can not afford to leave him. So that is not an option at the moment.

Reasons not to leave: Perfect match outside the bedroom, best friends otherwise, planning to get married next year.

I have so much to offer to the right woman, and feel like my life is being wasted. On bad days, it borders on the ""self harm"" edge of things. As stated, I look at too much pron, drink too much (the only way I can get to sleep usually) and dream and fantasize about a woman who will love me and love being with me, and who will NOT be physically limited by a medical ailment. I get the whole ""in sickness and in health"" thing, I really do, but surely there MUST be a limit, right??",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1fjfia,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1fjfia/really_torn_our_deadbedroom_is_due_to_her_illness/,

Our last sex was 2-3 weeks before, for a multitude of reasons which also included her period (in the past this had never stopped us, but whatever). Yesterday I ask if she's still on the period and she tells me with a big smile that she's not. Okay, so maybe that means she's receptive. 

So after the kids go to sleep we're sitting together. I'm kind of trying to start things but she's not really responsive so it's difficult for me to push things forward. It starts getting later and later and she makes a couple of vague remarks - ""If you're sleepy we should just go to bed"" and ""What are you going to do?"" She then gets angry - ""I thought we were going to have sex? Why are you taking so much time to start?"" Oooookay. 

I try to get things rolling with some foreplay. I go down on her, something I love to do. She's never been a fan, but a few years ago she said she would like some finger action to accompany the tongue. So I'm doing that, nothing too extreme, and she orgasms 5-6 times. We try to transition to sex, but we have to stop after a few minutes because of pain. She says I used my finger too much and irritated things down there. I wasn't doing anything extreme at all (actually it was very mild) but okay, every vagina is different and maybe hers can't handle it. Too bad, but it happens.

She got up and put her clothes back on. She came back and said that she had been in the mood for sex all day and had been looking forward to it, so she was disappointed. This is news to me. I told her that sex is more than just PIV, so I told her to take off her clothes and come lie with me. I tried some kissing, caressing, fondling, etc, but the whole time she just looked kinda bored. After maybe 10 minutes I suggested we should just get some sleep and she agreed. She got dressed again and said to me ""If you need some extra time to take care of yourself go for it."" I tried to explain that sex and masturbation are two completely different things but she didn't get it at all and again suggested I take care of myself before bed.

I'm not bothered by the failed sexual encounter. It happens. What bothers me is everything else. The whole time she never touched me in a sexual way at all. Apparently her ""really horny"" is to make vaguely suggestive comments and wait for me to do everything. And she wasn't the least bit interested in my pleasure, suggesting that if I wanted to get off at all (remember, she orgasmed 5-6 times) I do it myself.

We're not sexually compatible. That's not new info but I didn't realize the gulf was so wide. Maybe way back when we were on the very edge of our compatibility zones but now we're way off. We have been trying to work together to increase her interest and being more receptive towards sex but now the mountain seems too high to climb. I really feel like I want to ask her to stop trying.

So what now? If we were single or simply just married maybe we could separate. But we're not, kids are involved. Am I willing to break up an otherwise happy family over this? No. Do I keep seeing other women on the side to make up for what I'm lacking at home? That was something I always thought to be a temporary solution. Can I really keep this up for another few years? Until the kids are old enough to support themselves? I'll keep working with my wife towards increasing her overall interest in sex, but after last night's events I've lost a lot of hope.

Until not so long ago, I (24/f, 3.5 y relationship) had no sexdrive at all. I used to be a very sexual person, but a lot happened in my life and had very low selfesteem. I also gained a lot of weight and was on birthcontrol that affected my libido. I hated all this and just wanted to feel like I used to and also satisfy my boyfriend. He's much more attractive than I am, so I was afraid he would want to cheat on me. He always said I was beautiful but that my weight was unhealthy.
I eat very healthy now and try to exercise, which is difficult when you're obese. But my sex drive has come back, I almost cannot believe it. I thought I wasn't physically attracted to my boyfriend anymore, but it was just me.
Of course I can't say this could be the case with your girlfriends/wives, but it's definitely worth looking into. Even if she's not fat, she could have a vitamin deficiency. Buy her fruit, veg, seeds, nuts etc. Make delicious smoothies. It could give her body a kickstart.

1369284749.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,1evwt1,I don't know what I should do about the horrible sex life in my relationship anymore. (A little NSFW),17,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1evwt1/i_dont_know_what_i_should_do_about_the_horrible/,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if I'm doing the format correctly or if I'm even in the right place so let me know if I need to fix anything. This account is a throwaway. My boyfriend knows the username to my normal account. Also, sorry for the huge wall of text!

For informational purposes, I am a 20f and my boyfriend is a 23m. We have been together for 2 years. I'd like to mention that he took my virginity. He had already been with multiple girls at the point we first had sex. 

At the beginning of our relationship (first 3 months) we used to have sex like bunnies. Almost 2 times a day, everyday. I think because we were in a new relationship, we just really wanted to have sex with each other. There was a fascination I guess. 

Around 6 months into our relationship he didn't want to have sex as often anymore. I still wanted to have sex at least once every two days. At the time, I thought he wasn't into the sex as much anymore because I was still in the ""I want to fuck like crazy"" stage since sex was new to me. Having been with other girls and experiencing sex with other people, I thought he didn't have the same attraction to sex like I did. 

By the time we were a year and a half into our relationship we weren't having sex at all. He never wanted to because he was ""too tired from school and work all day"". I understood that because he did have a physically-demanding job, so I stopped asking for sex so often. I thought it was reasonable to ask for sex at least once a week, but he soon told me that even that wasn't going to happen because he works Monday through Friday so he's tired all those days. I thought ""Okay fine. I'll ask for sex only on Saturdays or Sundays."" Nope. He said ""I'm still tired on Saturdays from working Friday night."" Well then I should only ask on Sundays? NOPE. He said because ""I have to be well rested on Sundays so I'm not tired for work on Monday"". I felt like such a horrible and annoying girlfriend asking for sex all the time, but if I didn't ask when would I have sex with my boyfriend? I could tell he was getting annoyed by me because I wouldn't leave him alone about it, so I just stopped asking altogether. I began to wonder if maybe there was something more behind why he didn't want to have sex. My thoughts eventually led to thinking that perhaps I was the reason. I began to think of myself as disgusting and undesirable. To say the least, my confidence went from a 3 to -5. If my own boyfriend didn't want to touch me, who would?

I tried explaining to him that I understood he was tired from school and work, but I didn't find it fair that we couldn't have sex at all. I felt like such a horrible person asking my boyfriend to make the effort to have sex with me at least once every two weeks. He noticed that I was becoming very depressed and sexually frustrated so he ""tried"" to have sex with me more often. It seemed like every time we did have sex it  was such a chore for him. It felt like he would only have sex with me to shut me up or to get himself off. He wouldn't try to arouse me or kiss me. He would just stick it in and thrust at me then get off once he was finished. Since I wouldn't be aroused, he would hurt me most of the time. Sex became a sign of hurt to me because it never felt good. I was always wincing during sex.

Now, two years later, we still don't have sex. He says it's my fault because he tries but I don't want to. It's not that I don't want to have sex. I really really do, but I get so nervous and scared when we're about to engage. I know that sex isn't going to be pleasurable. I know it's going to hurt. I've told him this multiple times. I've been telling him that he needs to arouse me so it doesn't hurt when he puts his penis in, but he doesn't try to do that. He just brushes it off. 

Finally, last night I was feeling a little comfortable in trying to have sex. I told him to touch me so I could get aroused. In turn, I was touching him and caressing him. He would just lay there and enjoy what I was doing to him. He wouldn't touch me at all. I got upset and told him that he wasn't even trying. He started grinding his finger on my clit, which hurt me. I told him to be gentle and he got mad saying ""Well I don't know what the heck you want me to do"". After a while, he started falling asleep. Am I really that boring and undesirable? I moved his hand out of my underwear and turned my back to him so I could go to sleep. He woke up and asked why I did that. I told him, ""You're falling asleep. You're not even trying to arouse me. It seems like you don't care whether I feel pleasure. You just like to pound me, while hurting me, and use me as a cum-bucket."" He started laughing and said ""isn't that what sex is?"" I got so upset and just went to the bathroom and cried. He fell asleep and after a while I went to bed and fell asleep too.

This morning I was getting ready for school and I wasn't talking to him like I normally do. I was just too upset to try to say anything. I've been trying to work on my anger so I'd rather not say anything until I have calmed down or else I'll just scream and cuss (which gets me nowhere). He walked up to me and asked me ""Are you mad at me?"" I answered ""Please leave me alone right now. I'm trying to get ready for school."" He continued being persistent about telling him if I was mad. I was getting really annoyed so I just answered him and told him that I was mad. He asked me ""Why are you mad?"" I was irked by that question because he had no idea why I was upset. I told him ""do you really not know why I'm mad?"" He said ""No."" He fucking said no! I continued, ""Do you seriously not know why I'm mad?! Do you not remember what happened last night? You basically told me I was your cum-bucket. Plus you just ignored me AGAIN."" He then tells me he was just kidding about that. I told him that it wasn't funny because I was obviously upset about feeling like I was only being used and ignored about my needs. I didn't understand how he would think that was the perfecting timing to ""joke"" around like that. 

So, currently we haven't had sex in the past 8 months. I'm frustrated and tired of being in relationship with such a horrible sex life. It seems like my boyfriend genuinely doesn't care about my sexual needs. He just doesn't seem to really listen to what I am asking of him. I don't know what to do anymore. The whole sex issue has made me question whether I should stay in this relationship. He likes to tell me that ""relationships aren't only about sex"". I agree, but I also think sex is a big part of a relationship. What I do guys? Am I in the wrong? Any advice? Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**: I wanted to thank everyone for their concern and their input. The general consensus here is that he's a manipulative douchebag. I can see what everyone is referring to and I agree that he is being a dick about this situation. I think it would be fair to mention though that he's like this towards the sex aspect of our relationship only. I'm sorry to have made him out like such a horrible person, but when it has to do with anything other than sex he is willing to happily drop everything to accommodate my concerns. He's always trying to make me happy. He's very caring towards me as in hugging me, kissing me, trying to make special moments by taking me out to dinner or a movie. If I'm upset even a little he'll try to reassure me that everything will be fine. But when it comes to sex...he just completely changes. Now that some of you have pointed it out to me, I feel like there's something he's not telling me. He may be depressed, have low testosterone, may feel inadequate...I don't know. Either way, it still sucks that he's not trying to fix this issue- either by not trying or not telling me how I could help. I will try to talk to him some more, but when I have previously tried discussing with him the issues of our sex life he just avoids having any involvement. These are my new questions now: Should I be concerned about the different person he becomes when it comes to sex? Could this somehow be a new red flag? If the reason we're not having sex is because of something that has to do with him, how can I help him? How can I get him to open up to me and tell me what's wrong if there indeed is something not allowing him to perform?

EDIT 2: I also wanted to mention that this is not my first relationship. I've been in a couple relationships before and none have been less than 6 months long. I know that doesn't make me any more experienced, but I just wanted to clarify that. He was just the first guy I had sex with.",,True,,t5_2t25p,1369351331.0,,,True,t3_1evwt1,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1evwt1/i_dont_know_what_i_should_do_about_the_horrible/,
1368265343.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,1e4ej5,Didn't think I'd end up here,16,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e4ej5/didnt_think_id_end_up_here/,"I'm a 29fHL married to a 30mLL. Been together a decade, two kids, the usual ""great"" relationship except for the DB. I guess I just need to vent or share a little, please bear with me. I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.

He's always been LL and yes I made a huge error, I know that. I do love him though, and cruelly he was my Prince Charming escape route from a shitty family. I kept thinking he would change, it was just stress or his living situation or his job or whatever excuse. (He makes excuses and I make them for him but he has admitted/claimed for a long time now he doesn't really know what's wrong.) Ten years later and I am half dead inside. Like many of you I don't recognize myself. The past few years he keeps nagging me about keeping up with some of my old hobbies like ""you used to do such-and-such, I love that, why don't you do it anymore?"" Well maybe it's because there is no color or joy to my life when my own husband can't be bothered to remember I have a working vagina? I can barely get out of bed in the morning and crawl through the day knowing that the part of my life where I was a sexual being was over before my twenties. Arts and crafts just don't hold the same appeal anymore....

So I have seen my twenties wither away in a sexless marriage, and now I'm about to start another decade of rejection and pain. We did decide to split once but he changed his mind and actually seemed to be making an effort for the first time. That has since ended and I'm too stuck now to consider it again (kids, money, all that stuff). We get along great and sleep in the same bed at least, so for the time being I don't think we're damaging the kids or anything. I would leave if it were better for them (having learned from my aforementioned shitty family) but they're still pretty young and for the most part the DB issues remain confined to the bedroom. (Outwardly anyway.)

He has tried counseling a few times and meds but nothing has worked. (He's been tested for some medical causes and nada.) He's with a new therapist and new meds now which seem more appropriate to his problems. But all it ever accomplishes is dealing with his feelings (mostly job stress), never touching the sex issue. Right now I guess I'm waiting to see if the new meds work but who would blame me for being less than hopeful? Not to mention, the meds are an SSRI so we all know what that will probably do to any libido he might have had. The last thing we can do is marriage counseling. Which I want to be a grown-up and try. But the thought of telling someone face-to-face that my husband has no desire for me is... wow. I cry every time I think of it. This is one of the most if not the most shameful secrets of my life. Hello stranger, let me mortify myself to you so you can probably tell me my only option is to deal or divorce anyway.

The current dry spell is after having a kid so I thought, you know, maybe this one is normal and not the DB. But it has been months now (before and after the birth) and he hasn't even brought sex up at all. He finally mentioned to me the other day that I should get my birth control from the doctor and I was like why? (Maybe it's PA but I've been putting it off—why bother and because it just reminds me of the issue.) He vaguely alluded to sex (sort of) and I said you know they still sell condoms at the store.... He looked kind of embarrassed. BUT STILL HAS NOT BOUGHT ANY. Now yes I was probably not helping there but come on, WTF? I've/we've actually never used anything but condoms so I didn't think it was too rude to mention. I know it's not fair to hold this incident against him but seriously, come on. Why the fuck am I going to go out of my way to get to a doctor appt and get this physically intrusive birth control for no fucking reason? Duh!

I want to love him so much but all I feel lately is contempt. Every little thing he does I'm thinking ""Stupid asshole!"" or whatever. Nice way to be right? I have made a huge effort to do more around the house (after getting some depression and medical issues taken care of) thinking being a better wife would spark some interest. Nope. He basically told me today that he's been helping out less around the house because I've been doing more! Like it was a win or something. He thanks me for doing things but that's all I get, no other change or reaction. He does do nice and special things for me a lot but I resent that too now—I feel like it just ties me to him and takes away my right to be angry. Not to mention he brings home presents for me and the kids, so I kinda feel like one of them to him!

And now I'm contributing. My sexual side is dead and I feel too awkward to take an active role in trying to fix this. He of course puts in no effort. He will have sex with me if we argue about it (!) but it's awful. He clearly has no interest in pleasing me (or himself really) or even trying anything different. The rare sex we've had has been the EXACT same routine every time for ten years! It's not that he's selfish, he just comes across as inept, inexperienced, lazy, not truly interested, yet somehow completely oblivious. I know he could be good in bed if he put in an ounce of effort. If he were 10% the man in the bedroom he is outside it I'd have no complaints. But if he would even listen, how do I tell him that? ""You suck in bed"" doesn't exactly light the fires of passion. And I'm not in a position to be turning up the heat when I feel like a disgusting monster. (Not to mention feeling more virginal than when I was a virgin!) On multiple occasions (on my own or at his request for help) I've given him books or clear instructions (literally a step by step few paragraphs-long guide to cunnilingus) and he had no problem casually admitting to me that he never even glanced at them.

Sooooo healthy right?! Every day I think about leaving, one of us dying, anything to escape this. For YEARS. I got an email from myself a few weeks ago. I wrote it five years ago and set it to be sent in the future. It was me telling myself if things hadn't changed to get out now. Little did I know I'd be in so deep there's no leaving for at least 20+ years. How do I do this? How do I survive this? Will I ever be a normal person again with or without him? Is it worth waiting again and again or should I work on truly killing that hope?

Through writing this I realized why I don't work on this anymore. Because if I give it any more effort, and it still fails, there's no turning back and I HAVE to leave. If I make the HUGE leap in confidence it will take to be sexual with him, or even talk about it, that is an investment I can't take lightly. If I fail it will kill me or force me out. Logically I know he won't change and I need to go if I want to be happy. But I'm not willing to face that now with two young kids, improving but tight finances, and job prospects that are okay but won't totally pay the bills on my own. I can't face that decision right now. Hanging around feeling worse isn't better but I'm not ready to be alone yet. Not to mention how shitty my self-esteem is right now after a DB and two kids—I doubt any man is going to be interested in my post-pregnancy body covered in stretch marks and loose skin.

And yeah, speaking of being alone, for various practical reasons I have no support network at all. Even the few friends I have aren't close enough to talk to about this, if anyone could be. So I am abysmally alone in so many ways. Imagine how much relief I felt when I found out a few years ago other people deal with this! Wouldn't wish a DB on my worst enemy but it's nice to know it's not just me.

All the things I've missed kill me. I did things with high school boyfriends my husband has never even mentioned in the best of times. (And I'm pretty damn vanilla if you couldn't tell, not having had a sex life long enough to get freaky.) He did have sex with me once on our honeymoon night but the effort was so lacking it was insulting and he finished in a minute before rolling over to sleep. Made me cry that night and still does. So many people talk about the first year of marriage being so great for sex and I missed out on that too. Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, a sexless joke. Actually I've come to dread holidays because I know I'll just be sad and lonely that night. Even making our babies was scheduled out and routine. Forget creating these beautiful children out of love. I had a fucking fertility calendar reminding me to let him know we had to have sex that week. Yeah. Don't even get me started on how big a sign that is NOT to have kids (though they are totally worth even this misery I'd rather have them with a man who notices me). I will never get all of that back and I have no idea how /not/ to resent my husband for that.

I wonder if I should just get ballsy and send him a link to this. I know I won't. He knows enough of this already and hasn't changed. He never will. It would just cause a fight followed by an awkward attempt at obligatory sex. Then we just have more resentment built up on top of him knowing how unhappy and angry I am. Well, I think he knows I'm unhappy but doesn't know how hateful I feel. What more can I say to get through to him after having already come to the brink of divorce?

Thanks for listening. It's almost 3am and I'm about as lonely as I am at 3pm. Sigh.",,False,,t5_2t25p,False,,,True,t3_1e4ej5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1e4ej5/didnt_think_id_end_up_here/,
1367950705.0,12,self.DeadBedrooms,1dvk3a,I (29mHL) feel trapped with my wife (32LL),15,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1dvk3a/i_29mhl_feel_trapped_with_my_wife_32ll/,"Sorry, this is probably going to be a long post, but I'm hoping for some help.  We've known each other for 13 years, been together for 12, married for 8, have one child and now another on the way.  This has been an issue since we lost our virginity to each other, but hasn't been a serious issue until maybe a year before getting married.  Like almost all of the posts here we've gone around the talk it through-things improve-time passes-things return to the usual cycle more than I'd care to count.  I've never felt like she's been physically attracted to me and don't need an entire hand to count the number of women who have been.  I'm 5'6"" 154lbs, not is the best shape, but not fat, no acne, no body odor problems, am a very clean person, I just don't get it.  Not that I ever thought I was Brad Pitt, but I don't think I'm fugly either.  Most people seem to like me and enjoy spending time around me.  

She's a nice person, just doesn't seem to have any sex drive at all.  Our relationship has changed quite a bit since the beginning.  Her family is wealthy and she was quite sheltered when we met, where I was poor and had a bit more real world experience.  I used to be insightful and made her view things from angles she didn't know existed.  She went to college (because her parents could afford it), I did not.  Fastforward to the present, I'm raise our child and keep the house while she works at a university and is pursuing her PHD.  So on top of never feeling wanted or attractive to her now I can't even offer intellectual stimulation.  She disagrees, but I feel like I could easily be replaced by a nanny.  I feel like that's my role anyway, the only difference being that a nanny wouldn't sleep in the same bed (but really that's about it).  I've gone back and forth on whether or not to leave, but I don't think I can do that to our child (soon to be children).  I've even brought up having someone on the side, a friend with benefits type situation, since she seems to have no interest in sex or intimacy but unsurprisingly that wasn't something she was comfortable with.  

I don't think I can have that 'sex and intimacy conversation' again, I just don't think it's in me.  The situation has driven me to suicidal thoughts several times in the past and I feel that same path coming around again.  Though let me be clear I WOULD NEVER do anything like that, suicide is for the selfish and cowardly and I detest the act.  Nevertheless though, I do find myself picturing it.  We've been to couples therapy and I've been to therapy on my own (stopped going since my therapists child started school with mine so I see her frequently, little awkward and not sure how she feels about it).  I also acknowledge that our current residence isn't helping since we live on campus where I see so many happy young couples who are overly sexually charged 24/7.

This has been bothering me for a little while again, but I seemed to be keeping it suppressed until a few nights ago.  I've been drinking more than usual (and by that I mean I've gone out twice in one week and had 3-4 beers) mainly because several friends are graduating and leaving so I'm trying to spend a bit more time with them.  Anyway, a friend who often confides in my asked if we could talk sometime in the next few days.  I asked if she was alright, to which she said she was fine, but worried about me.  I don't know why but that seemed to break any mental barrier I had up holding back all of this.  We haven't talked yet, and honestly doubt we will (she's rather busy in general and has a lot going on personally so I don't expect her to remember).  Anyway, I think I just needed to vent, but any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to read.

*Thank you all for your support and input.  I really do appreciate it.  Just to update, since originally posting we haven't really had a conversation (though I know I'm going to have to soon enough) but I did tell her that I was in need of something and it was getting to the point where I didn't think I could take it any more.  She said it wasn't that she didn't want to but that our child hadn't been going to bed early enough and she hadn't been sleeping well, and was stressed and all the other things she has always said.  That night I did get a blowjob which I do consider an improvement but again, I know this only happened because of what I said and that if I hadn't been the one to ""make things happen"" nothing would have.  It was however a small win since it was just a temporary relief and I'm still in the same emotional state I was in before.

Half a year later, spending time together and sleeping in the same bed is normal, but sexually she seems even more awkward around me. Kissing her neck, touching her breasts or moving my hands on her body cause her to freak out, and when we do have sex it feels like she considers it a chore, and it is usually arranged beforehand, monotonous (always the same) and unspontaneous (I can't even remember when she last let me go down on her) and she always seems reluctant.
Whenever I've tried to talk to her about it she says this is just how she is now, and she doesn't know what changed or why. I love her deeply, but I feel like I am a passionate person and this is driving me crazy. I just wish I knew what caused it and what I can do to get back the passion and spontaneity we had before.

I am a similar DB situation,15,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1c34or/thanks_for_sharing_everyone_i_am_a_similar_db/,"I'm 32m ML and married to a 30f LL for nearly three years, have been together for over five now.

I stumbled onto /r/DeadBedrooms and so far it has been pretty cathartic.  Also, perhaps a bit damaging as i read about other peoples problems that i can identify with or can see happening in my situation and it's building bitterness and resentment in me.  Which i am unable to stop from passively aggressively communicating to my wife. 

My situation is somewhat unique than most i've read.  We will have sex almost as much i as initiate, however she is very much suffering from ""corpse"" syndrome.  She's terribly uninvolved and unresponsive.  I am feeling no intimacy during an act that should be very intimate and I feel very much alone.  I just get the sense that she is letting me have sex with her, or letting me use her for my physical needs, so i won't look to someone else.  

Early in our relationship I was informed that she can't and won't likely have any orgasms, so i shouldn't get upset when they don't happen.  This can be dealt with.  I said i just wanted to please her and do not feel pressured to cum, the giving and receiving of non-orgasmic pleasure is still great.  However our sex started to get more tame and lame as time wore on.

She soon developed an aversion to me touching her vagina.  The only time it became ok to touch her there was when we(I) were preparing for penetration.  Coupled with no feedback on how to please her our(my) foreplay diminished to nothing.  During the act itself she is very rigid, not moving, she's never physically ready for sex because there's no way for me to arouse her beforehand.  

I read somewhere, years ago, that in bed people do things to their partner that they want returned on to them.  This made a lot of sense to me and has been how i interpret signals from my lovers in the past with some fairly decent results.  With my wife, all i interpret her saying she doesn't want any of this, that she's submitting only because i want it.  

So basically now i fear sex.  I feel alone.  I feel rapey.  I feel frustrated.  I feel inadequate.

I need to have 'the talk' with her soon, i guess... i don't know...

Our troubles seem to stem from a fundamental difference in our respective needs for sex: While I need to have it in order to feel good, he needs to feel good in order to have it. Seeing as how my fiancé is struggling with recurring episodes of depression, this translates to him being the LL, and I'm the HL. An ideal frequency for me would be daily/every other day, but lately we've been averaging 1-2 times a month. Although we do technically have a sex life, I'm not able to enjoy it due to the fact that not only does the sexual stimulation feel «foreign» and almost unnatural after such a long time without it, but also because it serves as a tragic reminder of what I'm missing out on.


I'm lucky in the sense that there is no lack of intimacy in my relationship. My fiancé is very affectionate, and shows me that he loves me in a lot of ways. But I am struggling to overcome this deep rooted feeling of deprivation.


Rather than embarking on a wall of text glazed in self pity (this is already getting long), I will contain myself to this one question: **How does one cope with the sexual starvation?** Sex is literally the only ingredient currently missing from my relationship, and I am in desperate need of advice on how to deal with it. I have come to terms with the fact that, at this moment, I can't do anything to change my bedroom situation. But I am hoping that I can change the way it affects my life.

1364861676.0,12,self.DeadBedrooms,1bh6sp,I'm (HL) the Expert on What Doesn't Work...,16,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1bh6sp/im_hl_the_expert_on_what_doesnt_work/,"My (HL) wife (LL) and I have been married for 5 years - together for 10. The sex has never been mind-blowing. In the first couple years it was good but my wife is not sexually adventurous. For the last 3 years or so we've had sex, on average, maybe once every 5 weeks. She doesn't want to receive oral, doesn't give oral, begrudgingly gives HJ's though hasn't done that in 6 or 7 months. When we do have sex there is no foreplay - she wants to get to the act. She doesn't like pillow talk - doesn't like sex with lights on - doesn't want me looking at her when we have sex. Generally, she doesn't like to talk about our sex life and gets very defensive when we do - along the lines of 'it's always my fault - I'm a horrible wife...'

She is willing to work on this but that generally amounts to lip service until I can't stand our situation and blow up at her about it.

Some background information that is really necessary to understand the situation we're in:

* She was molested by a babysitter when she was a kid and her parents didn't do anything when she told them.

* We can't have children because I have asymptomatic Azoospermia - no rhyme or reason why but I don't produce viable sperm (low sperm count is 20 million in a sample - my last sample I had 7 total sperm - not 7 million, 7) - the ironic thing is that we don't really want children - we tried to adopt but it fell through and we decided that we enjoyed our freedom and our money more.

* She is constantly stressed about everything in her life - work, gym, school (we're both in grad school and work full-time)

* I run our finances, the household and maintain everything (work split at home is 85/15 me/her.

* I am based out of the house for work so I am typically home by 3:30, she doesn't get home until 6.

* Over the last couple years we've both gotten on track with our health. She's lost 190 lbs and I've lost 80 lbs. The sex hasn't gotten better, it's gotten worse. 

* We sleep in different bedrooms because she's a light sleeper and I'm a heavy breather/snorer (no I do not have sleep apnea). I do not agree with this situation and want to sleep in my bed more (currently I sleep in there Fri/Sat nights)

* She is on Wellbutrin (you know, the anti-depressant that's supposed to boost libido) and Xanax (usually only takes on Sundays to help her sleep)

Last night we had a talk because I found her crying in our Living Room. What set her off is I tried to come on to her on Friday about having sex and she said, 'not now but let's try to this weekend'. We all know that means I'm not having sex this weekend! 

So on Sunday morning we wake up, we're connecting in bed and I try to make a move on her and she shuts me down. I blow up at her - tell her I knew she wouldn't have sex and it's killing me. She says, we just had sex last week. I say, that's the difference, you're doing it to make a quota, I'm doing it because it's enjoyable and fun. I then go on to tell her how I'm lonely, how we're not connecting, how I need intimacy and I take confidence from my partner desiring me. She says she just doesn't want sex - with me or anyone. 

I feel duped and cheated out of a sexual relationship. I bend over backwards for her to make her life easier and she won't even sleep with me!

Anyway, last night she's crying in the living room and won't tell me what's wrong. Finally, I get her to talk and she says that I'm too emotional and needy and that's pushing her away. She says she needs a man who takes charge (which I do but don't get credit for) who isn't emotional. She said my inability to give her children is affecting her (which I've long suspected but she denied). I told her if she needed someone to give her children then she needs to find it elsewhere. She said she doesn't want to, that she loves me. She wants me to work on 'my stuff' w/ my therapist - my stuff being my self-confidence, emotional neediness.

I know I'm rambling and if you've read this, I appreciate it. We both see counselors and we've agreed to go together to see one. Though today she said, I have so much else to worry about that I don't want this to be another thing to worry about.

She hates sex, and has no interest in being intimate or passionate.",16,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1b316p/me_m28_partner_f25_65_years_together_she_hates/,"We used to have a regular sex life, and over the years, it was dwindled to nothing. The last time i had proper sex was at least 6-7 months ago in September. We tried twice in October, but she complains about pain after only a minute or so and rolled over to sleep.

I'm thinking the most likely reason she experiences pain is because she doesn't get in the mood, andi have suggested she should allow foreplay. She has never been interested in it, and it's probably why she hates sex now. 

When we were doing it at least once every 3 weeks (even that was bad enough) in the two years before, it's always sex before sleeping, and ONLY missionary because she hates all other positions. 

I used to always suggest sex, but then i felt i was nagging, so i stopped - which just made things worse. I've talked to her countless times about it and nothing changes. I wasnted to see a counsellor for a 3rd party opinion, but she wont go. It should be noted she has mild Aspergers Syndrome.

She is not cheating, and she loves me, but because of her Aspergers, sometimes i feel it's in the companion way rather than lover? Make sense? I feel like our views on love have drifted apart over the years. She is comfortable with love as being simple hugs, a peck on the cheek and ""i love you'"" comments from time to time. Where i see love as an attraction and commitment that requires a bit of effort to maintain in creating a healthy relationship. 

I feel like i've given up trying and accepting she wont change, but i don't have a close circle of friends to fall back to i am pretty introverted. I don't want to leave her, but i feel my own love for her is fading because i can't get it returned in the way i need it.

1364318882.0,13,self.DeadBedrooms,1b1wbx,(26/f) I worry my partner (27/m) wishes my body worked differently (xpost from relationship_advice),17,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1b1wbx/26f_i_worry_my_partner_27m_wishes_my_body_worked/,"My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years, and have a common-law marriage. We have an awesome relationship, but our sex life has been undergoing some changes lately, and I worry that some issues that have been with us from the beginning are starting to take their toll. I'm someone who can't typically orgasm from vaginal intercourse alone; I need a lot of clitoral stimulation. I've felt in the past that he finds this to be a burden, or maybe that it would turn him on more if I was able to get off spontaneously just from having his dick inside me. He says that it doesn't bother him, but over the years a few things have happened that make me think otherwise. He once told me that my orgasm is ""expensive"" for him, and that sometimes he is just not willing or able to give me sex with the stimulation I need to reach climax. This is actually completely fine with me - I understand that sometimes it's nice to just have a quickie or just... fucking... fuck. But I think he finds it difficult to believe me when I assure him that it's fine. Sometimes we'll have sex and sort of lose interest in the middle of the experience, and he'll say it was because he could tell I wasn't enjoying it. He's also claimed he could tell that I don't enjoy going down on him, even though I absolutely do.

Let me stress that in general these things are small issues that come up occasionally, but on the whole we have high-quality sex that we both enjoy. We are both relatively low-libido people, and probably average about once or twice a week when all is well. But lately that's dropped to about once or twice a month. Last night we were starting to fool around, and I was really excited to get it on with him. We were going down on each other, and he started licking me kind of hard, and it stung a bit, and I asked him to be more gentle. He lost interest completely. He just laid there, sort of slowly kissing me, until I asked him if something was wrong. He assured me that it didn't make him feel bad when I asked him to be more gentle, but said ""I could tell it just wasn't going to happen for us."" When we talked about it later, he said that my asking him to be gentle made him think that sex was going to have to last several hours in order for me to reach orgasm, and that it was late, and he wasn't interested in doing that. I was shocked. I didn't have any intention of making sex last for hours, I just wanted him to quit doing that thing with his tongue because it was overstimulating and painful.

I've had to work a bit to become someone who can comfortably initiate sex or ask for what I want, and his losing interest as soon as I ask him to touch me a certain way makes me feel really insecure about expressing myself in that way again. It's getting to the point that this has happened enough to make me start associating sex with a feeling of... shame, I guess. I wish that my orgasm worked differently, that it was ""sexier"" or whatever. It's become difficult for me to masturbate, because every time I get horny I immediately think about our latest sexual mishap. I want to reassure him that just because my orgasm is elusive, it doesn't mean he's bad at sex or unattractive. But I also want him to reassure me of the same thing.

Just to give some background... he recently graduated college and got a job in a different state, so we moved about 300 miles. I was going to school and working at a job I loved back home, but I was totally excited to move with him. Since we've been here (~3 months) I've just been doing some freelance work, which has been slow to the point that I feel depressed and useless. I'm planning on starting school again this summer. Also, he'd been taking Adderall while he was in school, but he stopped after we moved here, which I think took a small but understandable toll on our sex life. About a week ago he started taking it again. I've struggled with weight-related body image issues for most of my life, but am currently the fittest I've ever been, and wish I was better able to enjoy sex in my ""new"" body.
