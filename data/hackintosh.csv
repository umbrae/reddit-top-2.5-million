I just want to let everyone know of commentor's reddiquette that should be followed, so that we can be peaceful to each other, and another ban doesn't need to occur on this subreddit (/u/Andersbergh couldn't figure out how to throw the banhammer until today.)

1. This subreddit is developed for new users. Stupid questions (TO AN EXTENT) are OK. But please use the sidebar to keep them to a minimum. We don't need 9 posts about if your AMD processor will work.
2. Because this subreddit is developed for new members of the /r/hackintosh community (welcome, guys!), we should be friendly an respectful. Remember, you don't know where they come from or their background, just because you have had a successful hack for over a year.
3. New users should be reading FAQs and information, more than asking questions, it is why they were developed in the first place. If you ask a question clearly answered to the right of the page, you're doing something wrong.
4. Yes, we will rate your build. It's one of the main reasons our subreddit exists. We are a community that help each other out, so let's do that.
5. Please be respectful of each other. The fact that this is reddit, doesn't change the fact that people will legitimately need help, and we shouldn't turn that down.

For all of our veterans (and we know who you are), please keep in mind that you may not have scrolled through TonyMac's forums in a while, but take a look at it today. Ignoring our most recent incident, much of TonyMac's forums have similar questions getting posted to our subreddit. We are here to help, not hurt.

If any of the other moderators would like to add anything, please do. Just in case I missed something.

I know I am not alone in this, because they keep getting similarly downvoted. 

For the love of all that is holy, please stop posting your nonsense ""prebuild"" threads, and your stupid, ""will this toaster work?"" threads. _It's nonsense. 99% of the builds you guys post up will work *just fine* in OSX._ The question is can _YOU_ get it to work. [Gigabyte motherboard, Intel chip, nvidia graphics -- of course it will work! Spend two seconds on tonymacx86.com and you'll have your answer.] **Stop worrying and start building.**

Also, I highly recommend ***avoiding*** [as in plague] any pre-built installers like iATKOS. Why? Because the darwin kernel is a fickle bitch. Whenever you use a prebuilt installer, you are getting all kinds of custom packages and kexts that most likely are not for your system and only provided for generic compatibility. [You might as well just boot -x safe mode permanently.] It's a nice theory, but overall just does _not work_. The closer you are to vanilla the greater your chances are for complete success, and the more you understand your own build, the easier it becomes to figure out what is and isn't working. 

Learning the ins and outs of OSX is mostly an exercise in frustration, patience, and _experience_. [PROTIP: You can't get experience asking people what to do. You only get experience by actually experience things.] This is not linux or windows and installing has a _huge_ learning curve, but once you understand the fundamentals you realize you can basically install OSX on damn near anything that closely resembles actual Apple hardware.  

So lets have discussions on what FakeSMC does, or modifying plists to include your particular hardware. Lets diagnose verbose boot errors. Lets debate the differences between AppleHDA vs. VoodooHDA. There are plenty of other subreddits dedicated to talking about hardware.

In another thread someone asked for help, he thanked me and was downvoted.  WTF is wrong you you assholes that you downvote someone for thanking someone else?  This was my reply to someone else and I think you should all take a second and read this.

I've learned in the hobby of hackintoshing, that if you are going to BUILD a hackintosh, you have to learn to google things. You can totally tell when someone has because they'll basically tell you ""I searched and couldn't find the answer.""
Telling people to google it is making the effort to teach them HOW to solve the inevitable problems their going to run into. Asking on a forum takes much more time and effort than just googling a few key words. And honestly, as a tech, yes, I hate seeing the same question 30 times in a week. So instead of being an ass, I'm trying to help teach HOW I, or any other senior hackintosher, solves our problems.

This is becoming an issue on this sub and you and the mods and everyone else here better start figuring something out, because the guys that KNOW hackintosh inside and out... the really good techs... they all leave this sub at some point and go to tonymac or any other forum. We get tired of answering the same fucking questions day in and day out. Sure, we don't have to, but at some point someone did it for us and now we try and do it for you. A few of us hang around and try and help, but for the last month, I've gotten nothing but grief for trying to show how to solve problems. I'm an abrasive asshole, I own that. But I'm also a pretty amazing tech, but I'm tired of noobs on this sub acting like dipshit customers I used to have. If you're here it means you can do a modicum of sleuthing to fix your computer. But more and more, we get people in here from /r/buildapc who don't even know what BIOS stands for, much less what it is, or why they should bother wading into it, yet they want to hackintosh. They make mistakes, and then when you point it out, they get pissed off and in comes the downvote brigade.

There needs to be some ground rules here aside from don't be an asshole. Google before asking should be a standard here. There is NOTHING that has been posted here that couldn't have been solved by looking on the first search page of google. People need to remember that hackintoshing can disappear almost overnight if Apple chooses to make things hard. They did it before with the first ""clone war"". Too many people were making clones, Apple wasn't getting their cut and finally put their foot down.
As a defense against that happening the hackintosh community as a whole needs to NOT BE MAINSTREAM. If it gets big enough, Apple will not just ""notice"", but they'll take active steps to kill it since they aren't selling hardware. I believe that there should be a barrier for entry here. If you don't know how to do some BASIC tech skills, you do not belong in the hackintosh community. This hobby is about doing it for YOURSELF. Not your mom, not your office, yourself.
If this keeps happening this sub is going to be stuck where it is right now, which is basically a ""check my hardware for me"" sub. It'll be nothing but first level knowledge as all the guys like me will have gone, and taken our years of knowledge with us. And in the mean time, you'll still be here, not googling the answer and still telling people to go to tonymac.

This was by far, much easier than I expected it to be.  I had a working Snow Leopard 10.6.8 install before I began, but upgrading to Lion failed every time I tried it.  Thankfully I backed up anything important beforehand.  The solution was simple here, wipe out and re-install.  
    
First, some background on my build:

Now, you may have to research your build if you are not starting off fresh.  My build is 2 years+ old.  If you're building new, check out this [link for a good parts list for a successful hackintosh build.](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/search/label/CustoMac)
    
The rest is simple to get Lion up and running.  Some key things to point out here that I had to figure out the hard way.  First, setting up your BIOS is a must.  If you have windows installed, update your BIOS to the newest firmware available.  (If you don't have Windows installed, don't worry about it).  Then reboot, get to your BIOS setup screen, and:

* Set hard drive mode to AHCI (NOT RAID or IDE)
* Set your Jmicron ports to Enabled if you plan to use them
* In power management, set HPET to 64 bit
* Set your graphics to boot PCIe instead of PCI (if applicable)
* Turn on integrated audio
* Set ethernet to Enabled (Both of them if more than one)
* In power settings, switch to S3

Next, unhook/remove everything from your motherboard so that all you have left is:

* The hard drive you plan to install OS X to plugged into the 1st SATA port
* The DVD/Blu-Ray drive on the 2nd SATA port
* Only 1 graphics card
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Only 1 monitor on the inner most DVI port
* Only up to 4 GB of RAM installed for now (If you have more, it can be re-added later).
    
All of this is temporary until we get OS X installed.  Afterwards, you can plug in, hook up, and re-install all your other hardware.
    
Now that we've got your rig ready, lets begin.
    
**Step 1:** [Installing and updating Snow Leopard to 10.6.8 and installing necessary drivers (kexts).](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html)
    
* Note: If your sound is not working, you will probably need the VooDooHDA drivers for audio support, but hold off on that for now.  DO NOT INSTALL THESE UNTIL AFTER LION IS UP AND RUNNING!
* Note 2: Be sure to select ""System Utilities"" when installing any drivers.
* Note 3: In my build, I did EasyBeast Install.  This was the first time I didn't bother with DSDT and it surprisingly worked quite well.  The only drivers I had to pick were for my sound card.  I have to run the VooDooHDA audio kext, so I just waited until I had Lion up and running.  If you do install the VooDooHDA drivers before upgrading to Lion, remove them first.  This will cause a kernel panic when you attempt to boot into Lion the first time.

**Step 2:** [Installing Lion.](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/07/xmove-multibeast-install-os-x-107-lion.html)

* Note: When booting the Installer partition, if your monitors turn black and/or go to sleep, you'll need to do the following on boot.  When you boot and see your current Mac install partition and the Installer partition, highlight the Installer partition and then type:

        PCIRootUID=1
    
If that doesn't work, try 
    
          PCIROOTUID=1 -x
    
* Note 2: If you already have VooDooHDA installed and Lion is getting a kernel panic when you attempt to boot it after install, you need to boot back into your Installer partition.  Then fire up the Terminal and type the following:

        rm -R /System/Library/Extensions/VoodooHDA.kext

        reboot
    

**Step 3:** Updating and installing any remaining drivers.

* Once you get to the desktop in Lion, go ahead and perform a Software Update from the Apple menu.
* I had to re-install my network card drivers after upgrading to Lion.  No big deal, I just fired up MultiBeast from the Lion desktop and reinstalled from there.
* If you didn't have sound support, you can now start up MultiBeast and install the Universal audio driver.  Be sure to select ""System Utilities"" any time you install any drivers.
* Reboot after driver install is done and you should be all good now.  If you have any questions, the [forum at tonymacx86.com](http://www.tonymacx86.com/index.php) is a great place to go for help.
    
This whole process took me about 2 hours; quite fast for installing OS X on a hackintosh.  Especially because it's totally current right after a new OS X release.  I hope this helps everyone out.  Good luck!
    
    
**EDIT:**
    
I haven't tried sleep yet, but will soon.  Also, I ended up creating a DSDT file for my machine so that I could get my integrated Intel High Definition Audio (889) working correctly.  The VooDooHDA drivers work, but not really well.  I had issues with quiet audio, and the center channel was cranked all the way up, producing a white noise effect.  
    
    
There are plenty of resources for further information on how to generate your own DSDT.aml file, such as [here](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2009/11/create-and-modify-your-dsdtaml.html), [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=235523) and [here](http://www.hackedbios.com/showthread.php/2-A-quick-guide-to-DSDT).  The only things I modified were to define my integrated audio properties and to prevent CMOS resets.  I didn't have an issue with CMOS resets, but I figured it can't hurt, right?  After generating my custom DSDT.aml file, I copied that to the root partition.  Then I removed the VooDooHDA.kext from /System/Library/Extensions with the command above.  Lastly I started up MultiBeast and selected the ALC8xxHDA and AppleHDA Rollback in the Audio category and checked System Utilities.  Once completed, I rebooted and was welcomed to a properly working audio card again.

I thought I’d share my experiences with that here.

You can check out the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/w7bdy/build_complete_corsair_550d_silent_build/)

And the album [here](http://imgur.com/a/Jquln#0)

My goal with this build was to put something together that was as silent as possible without sacrificing much on performance, all while staying below $1200. I was using an iMac before this and became spoiled with how quiet it was. Check out my post in buildapc if you’re interested in that process. I think I did pretty well.

As far as the component selection goes, I went with what are some of the most common Hackintosh parts. I opted not to go with Ivy Bridge or a Z77 chipset because support for that still isn’t the best yet. I really don’t think it’s a big deal. With the thermal limits I was dealing with in the Corsair 550D, I think the performance gain from Ivy Bridge would have been a wash because I couldn’t have overclocked it as much.

If you’re going to build today, I would recommend Sandy Bridge and a Z68 board. It will just make things easier and I think it’s unlikely you’ll really miss any of the benefits of IB or Z77. If you wait a few months that will probably change.

I really think the Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 is the go-to motherboard at the moment. There’s tons of support for it and everything works - sleep, USB 3, eSATA, Firewire, LAN, all onboard SATA (apparently on some boards the Marvel SATA3 ports don’t work but these do), audio, and everything else I can’t think to name.

I tried to use Kakewalk for my installation process. This board is supported but I just couldn’t get it to work at all. I have no idea why. It really wasn’t a big deal, though.

I followed this [guide](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/unibeast-install-mac-os-x-lion-using.html) just for the Unibeast section to get OS X installed.  I had heard of a few issues with 10.7.4 so I have 10.7.3 installed on mine at the moment. 


After that I used this [Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 Tool Pack](http://www.osx86.net/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2463) to get everything working.

That tool pack just combines a bunch of installs and whatnot that you could find on your own if you wanted to. The directions in the tool pack are a little tough to follow but you don’t really need them. Just run the Chameleon installer (your bootloader) and then the installer for the motherboard (leave all the default boxes checked). That’s it.

The 6870 works out of the box. You don’t have to do anything with it. It’s the best card you can get that works without having to mess around with it at all and it’s plenty fast for the casual gamer.

I downloaded Multibeast as well and installed the HW Monitor tools - just a nice menu bar applet that shows you fan speed, temps, etc. I highly recommend you do that. If you have an SSD, run the TRIM enabler as well. Or better yet, use [this](http://www.groths.org/?page_id=322).


I went a little bit crazy with my storage. There’s an SSD and 4 HDs in my computer but they all serve a function. I have OS X and all my applications installed on the SSD. I then installed two 1 TB drives in a mirrored RAID array (simple software RAID using Apple’s disk utility) and moved my user folder to them. You can use this [guide](http://www.macworld.com/article/1164891/keeping_mac_os_and_data_on_separate_drives.html) for moving your user data to a separate HD.

I like this setup a lot. 128 GBs is plenty for the OS and applications. It’s super fast and I like having all my data written across two drives in case of failure. I also backup both drives to an external Time Machine backup and use Backblaze. And on top of that, I have another hard drive in there for making a clone of my SSD boot drive. This is important in case you do something that completely fucks up your OS, which isn’t too hard when making a Hackintosh. I use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the SSD. I did that as soon as I had everything stable.

And then there’s yet another HD in there for Windows 7. If you use Chameleon as your bootloader, you’ll need to pick the system reserved partition (something Windows 7 creates) at startup in order to boot to it. Apparently Chameleon installs the necessary boot files to this partition for some reason.

For wireless I bought [this internal card](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704133), which I highly recommend. You plug it in and it works perfectly. OS X thinks it’s an Airport Card. It’s also dual band N and a good price. You can’t beat it.

I bought this [Bluetooth adapter](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833340012) but couldn’t get it to work. Your mileage really varies with these things.

I ordered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SBF108/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00) a couple days ago but it hasn’t come in yet. Hopefully it works.

I also purchased this [webcam](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M2YT96/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00) to replace the built in iSight camera on my iMac. It’s far, far better than the iSight camera in terms of both picture and sound quality. I’m not sure how it would compare to what Apple calls their Facetime HD camera, but I’m guessing this one would still be a bit better.

Overall, I’m very happy with my Hackintosh. It’s extremely fast and isn’t going to cost me much more than what I can sell my iMac for - can’t believe I can still get around a grand for the thing.

Keep in mind, though, I had a lot of stuff already - two nice monitors and a lot of storage. Also, little things keep adding up. Make sure you take into account Bluetooth, wireless, and a webcam if you need them. That’s likely over $100 right there.

Also, if you’re like me and are coming from an iMac and are finally getting a computer you can upgrade, you’re probably going to find that you want to upgrade all the things. It’s hard to restrain yourself sometimes. I’ve probably sunk $70 into braided cables and new fans already. But that’s just me.

If you’re willing to put in the time it’s still a great deal. With my overlock I’m getting Geekbench scores of about 14,000 and can play most games at 1080p with max settings. I would say, total cost, minus monitors and storage, is about $1,200. That’s with spending a lot on the case and other things that were a personal choice. It can obviously be done way cheaper.

If you want to start with my build as a template, basically just pick my motherboard and graphics card and then fill in everything else the way you want it. You’ll end up with a great Hackintosh.

I hope all of this helps some of you in some way. This Hackintosh was a lot of fun to build. Comment if you have any questions. I’ll try to be as helpful as possible.

After using my MacBook Pro for a couple of years, I've decided that I don't move it around enough to merit having a portable system. I also thought it would be a fun project to build a PC, as I haven't since I was like 9 years old. I really couldn't find a case that I liked (since I am a sucker for the Apple aesthetic). I was able to find an old PowerMac G5 for under $150, so it seemed like a no-brainer to buy that and mod the case. While it turned into a lot tougher of a project than I had originally expected, I am very happy with the outcome. Here's the parts list:

Since it's going to be primarily for graphic design and photography work, having a crazy-good graphics card was not a huge priority for me. I needed something that wasn't crap to run the two 2560x1600 displays, but other than that, gaming performance isn't a huge deal to me. Sure, I'll play a game of Starcraft or two occasionally, but it's not a gaming rig. The current drive setup I have in the system is the Samsung 840 for boot and the WD Blue 1tb for my 'working' data. The two Greens are in a RAID 1 Mirror, so that's where I store my Time Machine backups and all my *ahem* acquired movies and tv shows.

A major constraint I had on building the system was OSX compatibility. I know most of you are Windows users, but that's not really an option for me at this point. I'm going to have a Windows partition installed, but I've invested a ton in Mac software for work and I don't want to have to re-buy all that. The Windows installation will be for any games that I can't play on OSX (Read: Bioshock Infinite, Mass Effect) and maybe some 3D Rendering.

After the whole process, I've got some things that I'm really happy with, some things that I'm less happy with and a list of ToDo's for the future.

**Good**

 - A really fun project. I really took my time with it, so was able to really make everything as perfect as I could, without a time crunch of needing a new computer for work.
 - So far, it's been wicked fast. Having all the internal storage is very nice.
 - The watercooling loop was a lot easier to assemble and bleed than I was anticipating.
 - Very quiet. That's one thing I was unhappy with about my MacBook Pro, was when I was doing serious work on it, it got pretty loud. Not so with this beastie.
 - Should be pretty future-proofed for the kind of stuff I need. Hopefully I won't need to make any serious modifications for the next couple years.


**Not so Good**

 - Getting all the drives in place was a MASSIVE pain in the ass and, unfortunately, there was no real way around that. They're all in place and I'll be praying that I don't have to remove any of time for quite some time. If you're looking for a mental image of how this was, imagine trying to thread a needle, when you can't see the needle or the thread, and you're trying to do the whole thing in a box full of knives. Not fun.

 - Due to Apple's stupid design on the front panel, the Ground for board runs through the now defunct FireWire port. Since my mATX board didn't have a firewire header, I had to buy a PCIE card that had an internal header. While this works, it's kind of annoying.
 - Due to the case design, cable management was really hard. Next time, I'd probably detach the back side from the case and make a false back, as many cases do. That would make the whole process about a million times easier.

**ToDo's**

 - I'd like to try making a jumper cable to solve the FireWire Ground issue. That way, I can get rid of the card, since I don't really have  a use for it.

 - The GPU power still needs to be sleeved. Not terribly difficult, just something I don't really want to deal with at the moment.

Other than those things, the system has been a more rewarding project than I've done in a long time. My two monitors should be showing up later today, so I'll post some pics of my setup, which will be far more fun than studying for finals (as I should be doing.) Thanks for reading all the way through... I know it was long :)

While Crossfire support was not explicitly confirmed, the newly announced cylindrical Mac Pro is sporting *two* AMD FirePro cards (I can feel my wallet stinging from that announcement and I'm not even going to purchase one!), which leads me to believe that it supports Crossfire (unless that second card is there for no reason).

The Mac Pro is obscenely overpriced and the iMac is just an unnecessary use of mobile parts.  While Macs are still an OK buy for general users, for running heavy processes in Windows virtual machines and multiple applications at one time, it literally ends up costing double or even more to get Mac hardware equivalent to off-the-shelf PC hardware.

However, it is absolutely not worth it to me to build a hackintosh if reliability suffers in any way.  I'm starting a new business and once I start getting customers the excuse ""my bootleg Mac is having kernel panics and isn't working"" won't sit well with them.  I have had authentic Macs since ~91 and the only thing that has ever failed was hard drives in some of the older ones, which was common back then.  

So, be honest Reddit, what are the real drawbacks to a Hackintosh?

   * How long after Apple releases a patch (e.g. 10.8.2) before it's available on a hackintosh
   * For basic day-to-day and XCode use, how reliable and usable are these ? 
   * Is it possible to boot Windows and OS X off the same SSD and then use different HDDs for data ? 

I plan to buy hardware from a standard build that people are having good reports with, but I'm still nervous about how successful I'll be. 

I mainly use the following apps:

   * VMWare Fusion - might move to VMWare Workstation if needed
   * XCode 
   * Mail
   * Time Machine - this is the biggest reason I don't want to move to Windows full time

So... I tried it.

Bought a HP Probook  4530 from the local staples on sale for 599.
Specs:

2nd Gen Core i5 2.5ghz
Intel HD 3000 GPU
15.6"" LED Display
4GB RAM
500GB 7200RPM Sata II HDD
720p Webcam

Installed via [this guide](http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=259&amp;t=41546)


After prepping the install drive from a vmware OS X install, I ran the install. Finished in 20 minutes. Booted again via the usb stick again and ran the ""ProBook Installer"" and rebooted without the drive. Worked.

Bluetooth, webcam (tested with facetime), wifi, and gpu with QE/CI all work out of box.

HDMI out works flawlessly with rotation.
VGA works with a small caveat.


Note: I also bought a HD caddy and replaced the CD drive with the 500GB hard drive and installed a 60GB Mushkin SSD from which the OS is installed. Boots in 15 seconds.


The only issues are: 
&gt; the bluetooth stops working after sleep and doesn't support the magic mouse. Fixed with a usb dongle.

&gt;Wifi stops working after sleep. Disable and re-enable it from the quickbar and it works again.

&gt; VGA display turns black when changing resolution. (I use a 1080x1920 external monitor for coding.) This is fixed by using the *wake trick*; Put laptop to sleep and then wake it. The VGA display turns back on when it wakes back up at the resolution you set.

&gt; Battery life is only 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Take it or leave it.


So in short, minus the battery life, and a few stupid issues, you get a weird cross-breed between a macbook air's spec and a macbook pro's specs for 700 bucks (considering addition of SSD).",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_uev8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/uev8s/completely_working_oob_hackbook_air/,

My Mac Pro 3,1 is dying. I was waiting for the new MP to come out, but I have a feeling we won't be seeing one until Q3 2013, because Apple is likely waiting on Ivy Bridge Xeons. I don't even know if this thing will boot that long. 

I've been watching the Hackintosh community with interest for a few years, but have never pulled the trigger on building one because, although I'm confident that I can get one up and running once, I'm worried about subsequent OS updates. I really don't know that I have the time/patience to carefully test every single OS update that comes down the pipe, yet I'm afraid that if I don't, I'll be looking at a non-booting Hackintosh that I get to clean install or whatever to get back. 

So my question(s) to you folks is this:

How **long** have you been happily Hackintoshing? How many years? How many OS updates? Are you current? Is that even possible?

Thanks much in advance.

I thought I'd sworn off the bug, for good, but there I was, huddled over my four-headed hydra of a computer at 2:30 in the morning, rebooting compulsively and discovering the perfect blend of MultiBeast patches and tweaks.

I must say, it was a LOT easier than the last time around with my 2006 Core 2 Duo machine.  I now have an Intel DP55SB board with a first-gen i7 870, and it only ever ran Win7 until I unleashed Mountain Lion on it in the wee hours of today. 

Unibeast + Multibeast was almost seamless, after I'd spent countless hours reading others' frustrations in forums. I found less than 10 mentions of my specific motherboard ANYWHERE online, and saw plenty of hair-pulling associated, while I was blown away to discover that there was a DSDT just for me, already available in the TonyMac archive. It only took two reboots and I have a functional, sleepable box with everything but audio.  

I think I'm going to just grab one of the USB audio adapters I have ferreted away in a drawer, somewhere, and run with that for a while, and learn how to best image the working system to a thumb drive for convenient restore recovery. Only then will I bother with relearning how to swap the KEXT's and find a fitting VooDoo/HDA/RealTek driver. 



Thanks to you guys I learned that I should drop to 4GB memory before installing. Thanks to you guys I knew that sticking close to Intel-reference components simplifies the equation a bit. 

Thanks to you, I haven't sleept proper since the week began, and my child will mistake me for a movie zombie man. Thanks to you crazy people, I have a new fixation, all over again.

But after lurking here for months, the siren song was too compelling, and I have a Faux Mac Pro filling my livingroom once more.

###*Build*  

* Intel Core i7-2600 Processor

* Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 Motherboard

* HP ZR24w 24-inch 1920x1200 Monitor

* Corsair Vengeance Blue SDRAM (16GB)

* DIY AirPort Card (ebay!)

* Lite-On LightScribe 24X

* Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus CPU Cooler

* Antec Performance One P183 Case

* Logitech MX Revolution

  .

###*Construction*  
I haven't built or owned a tower for over a decade. I put the thing together the night I received all the components. Incredibly, the only step I got hung up on was mounting the SSD properly in the case (separate screws!). Everything else, including Lion installation and building a genuine Airport Express, was a breeze.  

  .

###*Experience*  
This machine is primarily being used for video editing. (NOTE: I have a 2TB G-Tech drive w/ eSATA for my media). I referred to [NoFilmSchool's Hac Pro](http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/where-to-buy/) list as a model and bought most everything Koo suggested. Koo’s step-by-step assembly and explanation and [Tonymac’s UniBeast/Multibeast]( http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/unibeast-install-mac-os-x-lion-using.html) installation was perfect. This thing boots in about 5 seconds.

  .

###*Video Editing*  
I decided to take the plunge and learn Final Cut Pro X. Editors hated the shit out of this software back in June but after three substantial updates it’s proving to be just as powerful and intuitive as old FCP. I watched 3 hours of tutorials and have been happy with my workflow for the past few weeks.  
 
IMO: The first Final Cut was built for tabletop editors and the actual logistics of digital linear editing were improvised. FCPX was designed in response to the ENTIRE experience of using digital video. Importing makes more sense, organizing hard drives, making duplicates of raw formats vs. transcodes. I’m able to cut with raw DSLR footage (FCPX is 64-bit, fucker is crazy fast) but transcoding media and proxy media is incorporated into the software if you need it. Editing workflow is different (magnetic timeline….), I’m not as quick as I used to be but I’m getting there. I’m cutting music videos so I’m ignoring sound at the moment. The retiming features are incredible. Exporting has presets Youtube, Vimeo etc. along with the old presets and the usual Export to Compressor. I haven’t found myself getting angry at the software or befuddled by design choices. This thing is nothing like DVD Studio Pro, for example, which is the most difficult and poorly designed application I’ve ever had to learn. I’m having a good time.  

  .

*****
###*Update #1*  
I've been playing with the export presets (Vimeo, Apple Devices) and have found it unstable. I almost always have to restart the machine even if the export is successful. If FCP doesn't beach-ball, Finder will, or QT when I try to open the export product. Not sure what the issue is yet. I am compressing mixed 1080p/720p (some Apple ProRes 422 HQ, a few clips in raw native DSLR) down to H.264 720p. Some old forum threads suggest switching codecs is a bad idea. And I should probably just transcode everything to ProRes as usual. I do eventually get a good export, the computer is just unhappy about it.

In Win7 I am running the GTX460's in SLI. Only use it for gaming. In OS X (Lion 10.7.1) they run as two cards to feed all 3 of my u2412m's. 
Also am using the Apple bluetooth keyboard and Trackpad. Love it. QE/CI and full resolutions on all three screens. Don't have a problem yet. :D

**Guides:**

I first used KakeWalk with just one card installed got my system running up to 10.7.1 then I followed this guide for the two cards: [Link](http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=8660)",,False,,t5_2quen,True,,,True,t3_m01ih,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/m01ih/my_new_hackintosh_i72600k_16_gb_dual_gtx460/,

I started off by looking over [TonyMac's CustoMac parts listing](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/08/building-customac-customac-pro-2010.html), but then tweaked it a little bit.

* [Antex Three Hundred case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129042)

I couldn't fit all 4 monitors on my desk, so I purchased [this mount](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=109&amp;cp_id=10828&amp;cs_id=1082808&amp;p_id=5559&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) from Monoprice.


Everything came together perfectly, and I followed [TonyMac's CustoMac Install Guide](http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=81&amp;t=11465) to the T to get it all working 100%.  I Only ran into two issues:

* I didn't have a wireless card, and while not necessary since I run a wired LAN, I wanted it just in case.  I followed [this guide](http://x86wifi.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-build-your-own-real-airport-card.html) to get a 100% native Airport Extreme card inside my HackPro.

* It doesn't really say it anywhere, but ATI Eyefinity cards are limited to two ""Legacy""/Passive Mini-Displayport adapters.  They ship you a plethora of different kinds with the graphics card (HDMI, DVI, VGA, Displayport), but they are all passive and you can only use two of them in any combination.  I had to go out and purchase two Active adapters to run my 3rd and 4th monitors.  Apple sells Dual-Link DVI Active adapters, but those cost $99 a piece.  I found these [Accell Active Mini-Displayport to DVI adapters](http://www.amazon.com/Accell-B087B-006B-DisplayPort-Single-Link-Certified/dp/B004071ZXA) that don't require external power (supplied on the Dual-Link by USB) and run perfectly.

All I'm waiting on now is my bluetooth dongle to ship in from DealExtreme so I can use my wireless Apple keyboard and Magic Trackpad instead of my G15 gaming keyboard and MX Revolution mouse.

Everything is working great! iMessage, iCloud, and even AirPlay mirroring with the MacMini6,2 SMBIOS!

It's currently being used as the family computer until we can get a new router, as I'm getting 5Mbps down where it is at the moment, and  0.02Mbps in my room.

I'll post some pics of the PC soon. I've also got a video of the assembly process thats uploading right now. If you've seen my other posts here, I had some issues with dual booting Windows 8 and Mac, but I've ironed out those issues by using Parallels Desktop.

Finally succeeded in installing 10.9 on my Hack. It took for what seemed forever and the installer kept crashing until I realised when I'd opened my case to unplug my main drive I'd accidentally blocked my CPU fan with a wire and the system kept overheating, if you've seen my G4 case mod you'll see how this is easily done. So my first piece of advice is don't try to install when your CPU is at 100 degrees plus.

I followed the guide on insanelymac here: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/289062-109-mavericks-simple-vanilla-hackintosh-install-guide/

I had to do a few things differently, namely copying FakeSMC and NullCPUPowerManagement manually to my library via my other OS X partition.

Also installing the newest build of Chameleon direct to the 10.9 drive won't allow it to boot, it'll only boot from the USB drive I made. (fixed, forgot to copy the boot file over, the new Chameleon release while buggy, boots my ML partition too incase anyone was wondering).

Just ran multi beast and now my ethernet and sound are working, graphics are at full acceleration. Everything appears to work. I'm going to give it a day or two and if it seems stable I may adopt it as my everyday. One thing is for sure it is so much faster than ML, can't say that with benchmarks but the experience feels so much smoother.

Pic: http://i43.tinypic.com/9u3j1c.jpg

If anyone needs any help or has any questions give me a shout.

UPDATE: The preview is pretty stable so I migrated it over to my main drive and relegated a clone of my ML installation to a back up partition.

The only thing wrong I have found is steam games suffer terribly with lag and screen tearing. Native games (Borderlands 2 for example) seem to have benefited from the upgrade, I'm getting about 5-10fps extra in some games.

1370733905.0,21,self.hackintosh,1fyahj,Perfect GA-Z77X-UD3H Build,24,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1fyahj/perfect_gaz77xud3h_build/,"Hi guys, here is an insight to the challenges and solutions that I faced in setting up my hackintosh.


Setup: 

* OS: 10.8.3 /w unibeast
* Motherboard: GA-Z77X-UD3H
* Graphics Card: Saphire 6850
*Monitors: Dual over DVI

For multibeast I selected the atheros ethernet kext to get my internet working. I used the kernel flags darkwake=8,dart=0 to resolve sleeping and other issues.


After installing the OS with unibeast I had the following problems:

* 1. VIA 2021 Audio did not work at all
* 2. Could not have two monitors enabled with GraphicsEnabler=Yes, only worked with GraphicsEnabler=No
* 3. USB 2.0 froze for ~1 minute after un-sleeping
* 4. USB 3.0 ports did not work

I resolved problem 3 and 4 by using GenericUSBXHCI.kext found online and setting an additional kernel parameter -gux_defer_usb2 to resolve the USB 2.0 port issue after sleeping.


Problem 2, the video card not working properly with 2 monitors and GraphicEnabler was resolved by a forum post found here:[6850 second monitor](http://www.tonymacx86.com/mountain-lion-desktop-support/61855-6850-second-dvi-port-dead-5.html) And the following chameleon boot settings:

* GraphicsEnabler=Yes 
* AtiConfig=Gibba
* AtiPorts=5


Finally, the last problem with the audio not working was the trickest to resolve.Turns out that somebody on osx86 had posted a DSDT patch and modified AppleHDA.kext to get audio working -- the catch was that it was for a slightly different motherboard GA-Z77-UD3H. His modifications worked but they **killed sleep** for my machine -- mainly because the DSDT tables were slightly different between the motherboards.


So, I got this crazy idea to merge his DSDT table into mine -- only selecting the audio card modifications. After some research online I found out that I mainly wanted the Device(HDA) stuff in the DSDT. It ended up being a fairly trivial import. **It worked**, audio and sleep worked perfectly. [Made this osx86 submission](http://www.osx86.net/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=3917)


Now I have a completely working hackintosh that functions just like the real thing, sleep works, audio works, dual monitors work, reset works, shutdown works, USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 work.

The install process couldn't have been easier. All I had to do was change a few BIOS settings, throw in the Unibeast drive, install and do the post installation, no errors or issues at all. Running like a champ on 10.8.3.

Coming from a MacBook Pro, this build is as stable as my real Mac. I can't complain about anything. So fast, Xcode runs incredibly fast, and the Windows side is also awesome. Anyone looking to do a hackintosh, go for it!

However if I switch from OS X to Windows 8, the shared (exFAT) data drive will need repairing (via Properties -&gt; Tools -&gt; Error Checking/Check). Also, the Windows 8 clock (synced to time.windows.com) resorts back to GMT (from EST).

When I switch from Windows 8 to OS X, the shared drive does not mount until I go to Disk Utility, select the drive, and hit repair. 

Note, in both operating systems the shared drive is symlinked to various folders (steamapps and most of the folders in the /Users directory of both).

On the BIOS side. If I wish to boot into Windows 8, SATA mode must be set as IDE or I will receive a BSOD. If I wish to boot into OS X, it must be AHCI or I go into a bootloop complaining about a usb hub not being enumerated.

Suggestions as to how I can fix these problems?

TL;DR: people at /r/massdrop are getting together to purchase WASD mechanical keyboards at some great discounts (as low as $116), and I've submitted an Apple keyboard-style design for macs.

---


Hey all! 

For the last few months, organizers at /r/massdrop have been trying to find a company willing to supply mechanical keyboards at a steep discount, and the company [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) has been settled on. WASD has been very eager to work with us, and they've offered some great customization options for us. Many user-made designs have been submitted, including one I found that replicates an Apple-style keyboard in lettering and functionality. Currently everyone is voting on what designs will be available in the sale, and the voting period will end tomorrow morning, so get on it!

Some details on the keyboard:

- MSRP: $139.99
- Massdrop Price: 50 units = $120, 100 units = $118, 150 units = $116
- Switches: You will be able to decide between Cherry MX Blue, Brown, Black, and Red switches ($10 additional charge for the red switches due to higher costs to WASD) at checkout.
- Additional WASD Accessories: These will also abe available at a discount at checkout, the discount is TBD.

Timeline: 

1. The poll closes at 11am EST 9/18/12
2. Group Buy Starts at 1pm EST 9/18/12

Link to the poll (you'll have to create an account for free, but please only vote if you're serious): http://massdrop.com/poll/wasd-custom-keyboard-design

If you'd like to vote for my Appley one, it's No. 44: Apple Style for Mac - White. Here's [a mockup](http://i.imgur.com/IFr7T.png), the [adobe illustrator file](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/58328/WASD%20Apple%20Keyboard/WASD_Apple_wizpig64.ai), and [the original creator's blog post](http://www.clingmarks.com/custom-mac-mechanical-keyboard-lets-have-some-fun/893) which includes some final product photos and a custom configuration file for KeyRemap4Macbook (I've removed the angry birds space bar in my version).

With rebates I came in just a tad over my budget, but I'd say it's worth it. The PSU is a bit overkill, but I wanted modular and I am sure at some point in time I'll upgrade to an i5-K and overclock so it made sense. This is my first build ever, only basic knowledge but I learned a whole lot during the process and am super thankful to everyone who helped me out with the build and especially [TonyMacx86](http://www.tonymacx86.com/) for doing what he does.

Several changes are going to take effect, so please read these (especially if you have just visited /r/hackintosh for the first time!)

* Build posts are still permitted, but must follow a strict guideline to avoid repeat posts. **PLEASE** read the sidebar **FIRST** before posting, as hardware compatibility lists and FAQs are available for almost any part. Search for your part on this subreddit, it's why we made the searchbar so fancy.
* Do not post that you have an error. It **WILL** be removed immediately. If you have a problem with your hack, stating simply ""My computer won't boot."" does not help any of your fellow hackintoshers. Please state your motherboards model, CPU, and GPU as well as any information on the error (screenshots are always welcome!)
* Before you come to us for help, if you can't boot, try some common boot methods: ""PCIRootUID=1"", ""-v"" (verbose), ""-x"" (safe boot), and ""GraphicsEnabler=No/Yes"" are simple solutions, if it all fails, run ""-v"" and tell us what the last lines are (or take a picture!)
* We like seeing successful builds! Make sure you post your build specs and how you got it up for us!

If you are thinking about hacking for the first time and want to know if it's a good idea, the FAQ has useful tips on what to expect. Please do not come to this subreddit to ask if you should hack. Hacking is **NOT** an easy task, and **NOT** for the faint of heart. As Steve Jobs had started building the Mac back in 1980's, he created what we do today: a semi-hobbyists tradition, and thus, Hack's should not be considered a permanent and cheap method for getting a Mac, since they are unstable, unreliable, and not easy to perform.",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_vm7bf,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/vm7bf/rhackintoshs_policy_change/,moderator

He wants to build a hack that is a complete beast, money is not much of a problem. He just doesn't want to spend $8,000 on a Mac Pro again. So, go crazy but try to keep it around a few grand. What hardware would you recommend?

P.S. What he really wants is a crazy fast processor, close to the nicest you can get. I'm just not too sure about the i7 Extreme's compatibility with Mac OS X. Finals week, no time to research right now.

The Xeon E3-1230v2 is $220 at Microcenter while the i7-3770 is generally around $310. I didn't need integrated graphics as I had the 660ti. I also really like the idea of having the same kind of CPU that was in the actual Mac Pros.

**Description**

I am posting this because I thought others might be able to benefit from my experience.

This build has been great so far. The 660Ti is a very nice graphics card at a reasonable price, and setup was very smooth.

I used the Unibeast/Multibeast method to install Mountain Lion on it, which was also very smooth. The 660 Ti doesn't require the ""GraphicsEnabler"" which is flagged to ""Yes"" by default, so I had to boot with the ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" flag and then permanently disable it using Multibeast, but everything else was pretty much plug and play.

See the screenshot in the linked PCPartPicker page for my MultiBeast options.

Eventual plans for this build include one more hard drive (one SSD and one HDD for Windows and Mountain Lion, respectively) and perhaps 4 more gigs of RAM, though I don't think I've really needed it yet.

I thought I'd share something I noticed when building my system that some people may overlook, and that's i3 speed stepping. The issue isn't really covered on the tonymac website or anywhere else and it just took pot luck to fix it.

Anyway when you finish installing OS X and you feel like everything is working I suggest you do the following:

1. Run Geekbench (the trial version is adequate) and compare your CPU score with the existing benchmarks. If it's ok, then quit reading and carry on as normal however if you notice that it's about half the score that it should be then you have a speedstep issue...

2. Install HWmonitor and the plugins required using multibeast. Start HWmonitor and look for your CPU multiplier, you might find that it's stuck on 16x and never changes no matter what you do. 

The solution to this is quite simple. Using multibeast enable c and p states as boot options and install the core i5 SDST setting. For some reason the i5 patch will fix the i3 problem, I don't know why but it works but it does and I've helped someone else out with the same issue by suggesting it. As to quite why this isn't pointed out in Multibeast or in any forums is a bit of a mystery but I guess it's because the vast majority of builders opt for an i5 or i7 and the i3 gets neglected.

The way to test that it works is to restart and then fire up HWmonitor again, doing simple activities should increase the multiplier and the CPU frequency.

I hope this helps some people out there who either A. Can't get past it or B. are running their CPU at half performance without even realising it.

Because the BIOS and ""about this Mac"" only report the maximum speed of the CPU, it's likely I could have been running at half capacity forever had I not fired Geekbench up just out of sheer curiosity.

As usual with anything hackintosh based there's a risk that this could cause a kernel panic and an unbootable system so remember to back up and proceed with caution. ",,False,,t5_2quen,1369409494.0,,,True,t3_1ey1ba,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1ey1ba/tip_for_i3_usersbuilders/,

Finally, the story:

I will soon be working remotely with my current company, moving across the country to be near family. I have a MacBook Pro for work, and a 5-year-old (with some upgrades) gaming rig for play. Since I will be spending all day every day on my home computer now, I convinced my wife to let me upgrade. The original plan was just to upgrade CPU, mobo, and RAM. Since all of those were outdated and incompatible with new stuff, I had to upgrade them all at the same time. I ended up upgrading a few other things, mainly because my old stuff was just crap, but I went well over the originally planned $700 upgrade.

While picking parts, I tried to make sure I chose things that would be relatively compatible. I was planning on keeping my HD6870, and it was just pure coincidence that a friend of mine had upgraded to a GTX680, and gave me his old 580.

A few details about the install. After a few tries, I figured out that I needed the PCIRootUID=0 flag, and nothing else. Once I got installed, ethernet and everything else seemed to work immediately, except for sound. However, I went ahead and ran Multibeast, but I never restarted. That night, I went to bed with the computer on, and let it put itself to sleep. Turns out that was a bad idea, as I couldn't boot the next morning. Also, while I was trying to boot, I obviously had the flash drive in the USB slot, which was fine except that I didn't put my OSX boot drive in the first SATA slot (the Windows boot drive was in the first slot, and I didn't think I needed to switch it). So, at one point after a restart, Windows loaded up automatically and apparently reformatted my flash drive to be Windows compatible (and thus, Mac incompatible). It actually took me a while to figure that out, because when I started up the computer, it would just take forever to give me the option to set my boot drive, and when I set it to the USB stick, I would just get a list of drives with some sort of message showing they couldn't be read (at which point I thought I had destroyed my whole system).

So anyway, I had to start from scratch, reformatting the flash drive in my MBP and installing Unibeast on it. Went through the install again, and ran Multibeast with pretty much the same options this guy selected: http://www.tonymacx86.com/user-builds/77030-ultrazones-master-audio-build-gigabyte-ga-z77x-ud5h-core-i7-3770k-32gb-ram-gigabyte-gtx-650-a.html

After running Multibeast this time, I made sure to restart. At this point, I still had my Windows SSD in the first SATA slot, and my OSX SSD in the second slot, so I kept having to hit F12 and select my boot drive every time (it wasn't even giving me the option in BIOS to set my OSX SSD as first boot priority.)

So, everything works great now (except apparently iMessage, but whatever, I've never used it on my MBP either). I think the only other tweaks I made (besides switching the ports my SSDs were connected to), were to go into org.chameleon.Boot.plist, change the Timeout to 5 (so there was sufficient time to press a button in Chimera and select my boot drive when my wife wants to use Windows), and add one more string, ""Hide Partition"", to keep my extra data drives from showing up in Chimera.

My business is essentially just an office job (documents, web, email etc.) and I love OS X, but I need an upgrade of the 4 year old iMac that I'm currently running my business on. I don't have the budget for a Mac Pro (especially given its age), but would like to move to a three monitor setup, get rid of external hard drives, etc. 

So I'm thinking maybe a hackintosh. Thing is, while my needs aren't heavy in terms of processing power, it is critical that the thing be reliable. I can't have it go down and I don't want to mess with it all the time and have problems arise that I always need to be dealing with. I also need it to run virtualbox with windows xp in there. 

Now I know what you're thinking, if reliability is so critical, why even consider a hackintosh? Well cause from what I've read, some people say stay stick to real apple stuff if you want something you can trust, others say that its rock solid and use it as their primary machine. 

I'd really love to have the best of both worlds, so reddit, what do you recommend?

I am using the asus N10 wireless adapter for wifi, which works well, though you have to use a utility (it isn't natively integrated with airport). ALC892 for sound, trim enabler, LNX2mac, graphicsEnabler=0, and IntelCPUnullpowermgt to prevent kernel panics (I couldn't get the flashed bios to work properly for native power management).

   * Chimera Boot Loader
   * Tonymac Theme (I like this one)
   * SSDT - Sandy Bridge Core i7
 * Reboot and boot to Mountain Lion SSD

At this point, the machine booted to the SSD and loaded Mountain Lion.  

Once I got the OS configured a bit, I went ahead and did the 10.8.1/2 updates.  I [had read](http://www.tonymacx86.com/os-x-updates/73181-difference-appleacpiplatform-kext-10-8-1-10-8-2-a.html) about needing to downgrade the AppleACPIPlatform.kext, which I did.  Everything appears working still.

This part I forgot to write down, and I forget the specific issue this was fixing.  But, I also installed a version of AHCISeries7Injector.kext.  (My bad)

At this point, I only have two relatively minor issues:
 1)  *About This Mac* shows ""AMD Radeon HD 6xxx 2048 MB"" as the **Graphics**.  I would like to get this recognizing my specific vid card.
 2)  My wireless card is not connecting to Wireless-N.

Aside from that, the system is running great!

The only bumps I ran in to were:

Had to use -x safe boot flag when getting snow leopard installed and updated to 10.6.6.

Once I got into Lion, I couldn't get it to come back from sleep. Ran into the cmos reset error and also my ethernet port died. I almost rma'ed the board thinking the ethernet port was completely gone, but all it took was unplugging it from the wall and resetting the bios and entering smart lan to get it back.

1. Buy decent hardware: Intel i5-2500K, Gigabyte Z68MX-UD2H-B3, 8GB Corsair RAM, Vertex3 60GB SSD, 2TB 2nd drive, XFX Radon HD 6870 Black, Antec 620w Bronze PSU, Antec Kuhler h20 620 watercooling, 
2. Remove 4GB, 2nd drive, 2nd monitor, VIDEO CARD, all unnecessary peripherals - attach monitor to onboard port
3. Flash BIOS to F5
4. Set BIOS up: Optimized Defaults (was crucial to get past welcome screen selecting country), PCH SATA Control Mode to AHCI, Boot Priority to CDROM, HPET Mode to 64-bit, eXtreme Hard Drive to Disabled
5. Boot with iBoot
6. Replace iBoot disk with Snow Leopard disk, press F5
7. Select ""Mac OS X Install DVD"", ENTER
8. Load Disk Utility: select my HD, 1 partition, GUID, apply
9. Close Disk Utlity
10. Continue with customised/reduced SL install, wait 19minutes
11. Replace SL disk with iBoot disk again
12. Let it reboot
13. Select the newly created snow leopard drive, get to the desktop!
14. Copy Combo Update, MultiBeast, DSDT file and 10.8.6 UpdateHelper to the Desktop.
15. RENAME DSDT file to DSDT.aml
16. REMOVE USB Drive
17. Run UpdateHelper (there was no ""before Update"" option for some reason?)
18. Reboot, with iBoot disk in drive still
19. Run the 10.6.8 combo update, BUT DO NOT REBOOT YET
20. Minimise Combo Update only
21. Install Multibeast with options from http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=24547&amp;hilit=Z68MX+UD2H+B3 (If MultiBeast Crashes, run it again.  It may also FAIL to install, but that's OK apparently)
22. DO NOT REBOOT YET - if network pops up, use DHCP
23. Run UpdateHelper again
24. Reboot, booting off HD now, removing iBoot from drive
25. Install Video Card
26. Reinstall RAM, HD.
27. Make sure HD BOOT ORDER is correct. 
28. Reload overclocked BIOS.

I had problems adding back 4GB + other HD - turned out to be HD BOOT ORDER issue - when adding 2TB drive, the damned BIOS assumed that I wanted to boot off that crappy platter first... I thought it was a RAM issue as many have issue with 8GB booting.... also, I found out that it gives a black screen if I used a VGA monitor with a DVI to vGA dongle - luckily had a DVI monitor available to swap in - thanks mum's PC - the widescreen monitor will be a nice surprise when she gets out of hospital this week. :)


Started to have SLEEP problems with rebooting, instead of waking - In BIOS, ""no execute memory protect"" - enable.



Geekbench scores it 13872, bettered only by 8 and 12 core Mac Pro's.

Total cost was about £700, vs. £3400  or more for similar Mac Pro.  :)

The Build

First you will need to acquire some software:
Unibeast (Follow TonyMacs steps for creating a Unibeast Drive)
http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/ ... using.html

Multibeast 4.3.2 (Place this on your Unibeast Drive after you have made the drive bootable)
C:Dq-OCPpT/MultiBeast-4.3.2.zip

Your motherboards DSDT (the link below is for my motherboard I listed above. Place this on your bootable Unibeast drive.)
DSDT/Database/DSDT-GA-Z68XP-UD3-F8.aml

Windows 7 (Buy it, make one, this you may locate)

Gigabyte Install CD Drivers (Comes with graphics card in box)
UD3 Mother Install Drivers (Comes with motherboard in box)

Boot1h (VERY IMPORTANT. I had to extract this myself so hopefully this file sharing site is efficient for it. Place this on your bootable drive)
http://uploading.com/files/f8mmb536/boot1h/

Setting your bios:
In order for your Mac to work properly you will need to set your Bios accordingly. If you do not your Mac will not work!! Here is an in depth video for your bios settings:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAkCmGOp1_U

Once your bios are done it is time! Dudududuahhhhhh!!!

Installing Mac OS X and Windows 7
First plug in your bootable Unibeast drive and a mouse.

Second start your computer and hold F12.

Next use the arrow keys to scroll down to USB-HDD and hit enter.

Your computer saying something along the lines of booting system with a lot of dots after it.

You will then see a menu with the name of your bootable drive. Make sure your bootable Unibeast drive is highlighted by using the arrow keys. Type ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" (no quotes) and press Enter. You will then be prompted with the Apple logo followed by the install screen.

Before you install anything we are going to partition your drive. Select English as your language and hit Enter. Use your mouse and click Utilities at the top and then select Disk Utility. 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vSU4uk5MzkY/T ... step+3.png

Select your computers main hard drive and select partition. You want 2 partitions. Name both and set one as Mac OS Journaled (Mac Partition) and one as MS-DOS (Windows Partition). Partition your disk and shutdown your computer. 

Next place your Windows CD inside of your DVD drive and install Windows. This is a fairly simple step-by-step process. Next install your Gigabyte and Ud3 Motherboard drivers. Windows side is now complete. Install any updates and shutdown.

Now because Windows is a jerk it will automatically set itself as your startup disk when you boot up. Simple hold F12, select your USB-HDD again and follow the steps back to the Mac install screen. You will see your new Windows partition as one of the options in the Unibeast launch menu. DONT highlight that partition, make sure it is your Mac one. (Don't forget GraphicsEnabler=No at the launch screen).

Now install Mac on your Mac partition by following the easy installer steps. Your computer should automatically restart. Now comes the tedious part. 

Once again hold F12 and select your USB-HDD. You will see the normal loading into the Unibeast launcher. Highlight your Mac partition, type ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" and hit enter. It may take a while but you will soon be greeted by a Mac OS X desktop! Congrats! Let's get in running in it's entirety now. First drag Multibeast 4.3.2 off of your bootable drive and place it on to your desktop. Also drag your motherboards DSDT onto the desktop.

Launch Multibeast and do a custom UserDSDT install. Select the following options as well:

The -&gt; represent pathing. The last word in the path is what you check off.

System Utilities -&gt; Repair Permissions
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Bootloaders -&gt;Chimera 1.9
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Kexts and Enablers-&gt; Audio -&gt;Realtek (uncheck non-DSDT in drop down menu)
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Kexts and Enablers-&gt;Disk -&gt; 3rd Party Sata
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt; Network -&gt; Realtek Gigabyte Ethernet 2

Click continue and install. When this is finished Realtek will open and try to install. DO NOT DO IT YET. Your computer restarts when you do. Next go to spotlight (magnifying glass in the top right of your computer on the task bar). Type in chameleon. In the list you will see org.Chameleon.Boot.list. Open it and paste the following inside, accept the prompt to unlock and save the document. This will allow you to achieve full acceleration on your graphics card: 

&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;plist version=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;AtiConfig&lt;/key&gt;

***You have two choices here. Do not add anything in stars.***

&lt;string&gt;Bulrushes&lt;/string&gt;
*****(Lower FPS may lag in games but enables DVI port)*****
or
&lt;string&gt;Lotus&lt;/string&gt;
*****(I run Lotus to play Starcraft smoothly through HDMI)******




&lt;key&gt;AtiPorts&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;4&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Darkwake&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;0&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;EthernetBuiltIn&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GenerateCStates&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GeneratePStates&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GraphicsEnabler&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Kernel&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;mach_kernel&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Kernel Flags&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;arch=i386 npci=0x2000&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Legacy Logo&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Timeout&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;3&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;UseKernelCache&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;

After you do this we are going to steal the boot back from Windows. This means you will automatically boot into Mac when your computer starts. If you do not want this, skip this step. Click the apple in the top left of your computer. Go to system preferences and click startup disk. Select your Mac partition and back out.

Finally we are almost done. Install the Realtek audio I told you not to install earlier and restart.

Hold F12 and boot through your USB-HDD again. Type GraphicsEnabler=No and launch from your install, as in your first bootable drive. We are going to fix an error called the Boot0: error which you will not have to experience the headaches from. You will see the familiar install screen. Select English and open Disk Utility in your Utilities panel again. Right click your Mac partition and Unmount it. Now back out of Disk Utility and open Terminal, it is also inside your Utilities panel.

In terminal, type:
diskutil list

Locate the location of your Mac partition mine for instance is Disk1s2. This means Hard Drive 1 partition 2.

Now type:
cd /Volumes/BootableDrive (Replace Bootable Drive with the name of your drive. Some call it BOOT some call it Lion. Whatever you named it during the Unibeast process that is what it is called. If you have a space replace the space with \ . So named USB Drive is actually ""USB\ Drive"". Once you have changed directories (thats what cd means in Terminal) type:
dd if=boot1h of=/dev/identifier 

This will copy the boot1h I gave you above to your Hard Drive. It will say transferring so much data, etc... Type exit and close terminal. Restart your computer and enjoy your new fully functional Mac/Windows! If you would like to boot your Windows partition simple hold F12 at launch and select the partition on your hard drive. Enjoy and hopefully I saved you some headaches!

I'm a professional video/televsion editor, and a Mac user for a long time. When I bitched to my friends about the lack of new Mac Pros, they pushed me to get a Hackintosh. I said ""I don't want to deal with troubleshooting when I just need to get my job done"" and they insisted that their systems were rock-solid and it would all be okay. After months of putting it off and reading up on editors using Hackintosh, I bit the bullet and spent about $1800 on my system:

http://imgur.com/I3kVMjF

I got it up and running in January and it's been *pretty stable* since the last OS X update (Final Cut was shitting the bed before that). I even got Messages working! However, if the computer ever powers down or goes to sleep, it's a world of hurt. Several stars need to line up for me to be able to get back to work:

* Keyboard (USB or Bluetooth) need to be responsive: 80% success rate
* App store purchases need to acknowledge that they're on the right computer: 50% success rate
* Drobo Pro (direct ethernet/eSCSI connection) needs to recognize that it's plugged in to something and come out of sleep mode: 20% success rate
* Firewire card needs to work: 100% earlier, 0% success rate in the past week

So my Hackintosh is fast and incredible when all systems are up and running, but pretty useless to me if those top three issues don't work upon boot. It's all seemingly random, as rebooting often makes some things work, but not others. On the off chance that I get a KP or need to restart for software, everything comes to a screeching halt for a few hours while I try to get it all working again. I can't deal with this when I have impending deadlines. 

I feel like I've made a big mistake with this investment. I would be happy to trade the horsepower and obscene number of ports in my Hackintosh for a loaded 27"" iMac.

My ultimate question is this: what is the best way for me to unload this machine, while minimizing my losses? In in Los Angeles, so there are plenty of people around for local pickup. I'm also open to ripping it apart and selling pieces on eBay, but it feels like used computer parts without their packaging wouldn't have much value, and I'd end up with a pile of leftover pieces. How do I minimize the damage?

I had my Pentium D based tower and with a lot of text work my Thinkpad T42 running Tiger as their primary OS all throughout the Tiger era, and I loved it.

Then Leopard came along, and my T42 was unsupported, so I bought a used Macbook Pro... the Pentium D was turned into a server and replaced with a new Core2Quad based rig for running Crysis, and I slowly stopped paying attention to the OSX86 community.

Now I'm working on finishing a feature length documentary, and needed to quickly piece together 5 editing bays for FCPX, which I had chosen over my usual AVID setup for its simpler workflow. I had my 2011 iMac and 2011 Macbook Pro, but I needed seats for 3 additional users... so I started going through random hardware I had lying around. I grabbed that old Crysis Q6600 rig, now retired for its sheer fan noise and aging hardware, and loaded up Mountain Lion on it with no trouble what so ever, it was a 15 minute install and everything worked! Then I grabbed a couple of Ivy Bridge-based oem machines I had lying around (Pick them up for pennies when they come off corporate lease from a friend), and gave it a go on those. AGAIN, everything worked flawlessly with their integrated graphics and ethernet working perfectly. I now have 4 working hacks in a single evening, 3 to serve as additional editing stations and a fifth to connect to our projector for viewing workprints and acting as a file server for the original camera media (only using proxy files locally).

This is absolutely incredible, coming from a background of OSX86 installs being something incredibly difficult and requiring very specific hardware choices. There's no compromise here, no limitations caused by poor driver support.

In what ways has the evolution of the OSX86 community surprised you?

So with that i have a mission. Build a mac for girl that doesn't want to even know its not genuine, a seamless experience. I start with using [Tonymacx86's buyers guide 2013](http://www.tonymacx86.com/325-building-customac-buyer-s-guide-january-2013.html)

*1st issue was eliminating Mini-ITX because i would need 2 PCIe slots one for gpu and the other for a compatible PCIe Wireless adapter (AFAIK no Mobo supports both onboard BT and WIFI) That narrowed down the chassis search to M-ATX. Although it wouldn't have been my first choice for some reason she gravitated to the Thermaltake Lanbox Lite w/ Window. She even plans on buying it now and painting it some sort of glossy purple.

*Issue #2. GPU choice: 660ti , i know the card will be overkill for her. its arguably better than my own card (570) but it has out of the box compatibility with Hackintosh. The next step down that has the guaranteed full acceleration is the 650.. and I'm not sure it will perform even for her. Both the 650ti and 660 are iffy on reported compatibility.

Basically I'm hoping this configuration is going to do the trick with minimal hassle. I myself built a gaming PC and as a side project down the road i installed OSX but my video card acceleration was unsupported. it sucks!

Opinions?

Ubuntu &amp; Windows 7 boot without issue.  Neither my main osx drive (corsair ssd) nor my carbon copy clone will boot.

**The original Unibeast &amp; Multibeast USB drives I used to build it to begin with won't boot.** (boot0:done, boot1: error.)   I wiped the drive with 1s and 0s and reinstalled and tried again...no good.


I CAN access my CCC mechanical hard drive through my old rboot cd, but that freezes @:

&gt;Refusing new kext com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily, v2.6.5: a loaded copy with a different executable UUID is already present.



That drive didn't have a boot loader on it.



I can't access my original drive (the ssd) through rboot, because I can't access rboot when that drive is plugged in. 



I tried kakewalk, (boot0:done, boot1: error.)



Bios settings:
“SATA RAID/AHCI Mode” to “AHCI”,
ACPI Suspend Type to S3(STR), &amp; 
HPET Mode to 64-bit mode



I wanted to just create a new install on a spare drive I have, but can't get into Unibeast or cakewalk to do so.  It **might** be the usb drives I'm using, but they worked before. If it is just a matter of ""sometimes they just stop working without any indication"" then it's difficult to consider that to be reliable by any useful definition. I really thought my CC clone would protect me from all this.  It was confirmed bootable before all this happened. 

It feels like there is something different about the mother board...but it seems 100% functional in ubuntu and windows.

I posted this in /r/battlestations last week and thought I'd share with you guys too. So I finished my dual boot Win 7 / Mountain Lion build. Decided to go wireless with the peripherals after being inspired by another Hackintosh post on that sub. Using Lifehacker's [ Always Up-to-Date Guide to Building a Hackintosh](http://lifehacker.com/5841604/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-building-a-hackintosh) as a rough guide I installed my App Store copy of ML via UniBeast, then tweaked a bit with MultiBeast. Massive thanks to Tonymacx86 and its forum, particularly [this golden build post](http://www.tonymacx86.com/golden-builds/70530-slugnets-video-editor-ga-z77x-ud5h-i7-3770k-gigabyte-geforce-gtx-660-ti.html) which details the kexts needed for the motherboard and instructions on how to get OpenCL working with the GPU, which other than that worked out of the box. 

Specs:

**Optical Drive** | [Lite-On iHOS104-06 Blu-Ray/DVD/CD Drive](http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/part/lite-on-optical-drive-ihos10406)

The reason for the varied drives is that two of them (Samsung 830 128gb SSD and the 1tb barracuda hdd) are from my PC's previous incarnation as a straight gaming PC (motherboard and GPU have changed since then). The Caviar green was an external drive that I popped open using a guide from YouTube, and the 64gb Crucial M4 is for Windows 7. I'm using the Samsung 830 for Mountain Lion, the Caviar green 1tb for Mac media, and the Barracuda 1tb for Windows Steam games.

I'm using a [TP Link TL-WDN4800 450Mbps Wireless N Dual Band PCI Express Adapter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006PMX964/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) for wifi, which worked out of the box with absolutely no faffing about needed. 
The bluetooth dongle I'm using for the wireless keyboard is the [Belkin USB Bluetooth 100m adaptor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Bluetooth-Adapter-100m-Range/dp/B001BRV7JE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349990995&amp;sr=8-5).
The Logitech mouse has its own little dongle which is plugged in to one of the rear usb ports. The Filco Majestouch II is for gaming.

The only issues I had were the that the CPU seemed to be being throttled in ML against my wishes, and this became evident on the initial geekbench test, which came back with a score of less than 5000. I tried a few things and eventually solved the issue by adding the 'nullcpumanagement' kext from MultiBeast, which more than doubled the geekbench score (results are in the imgur album). AFAIK Ivy Bridge CPU's don't have this issue, which is why it didn't crop up in the golden build guide I used. The CPU is currently overlocked to 4GHz.

The only outstanding issue is that the keyboard battery constantly displays 100% in system preferences, though I have rechargeable batteries close to hand for when it does die :)

Overall I'm really happy with this build and the experience has been awesome. I strongly recommend this motherboard to anyone looking for an easy to work with board.

* I do plan on overclocking
* I need 2 Thunderbolt ports
* I will be doing some moderate gaming, nothing too serious

Once assembled, installation of the OS was incredibly simple using Unibeast and Multibeast. Tweaking took some time, but once done, the system performed almost flawlessly. Able to make my own DSDT. Nothing major was required to make this function, and all of the kexts required are included with Multibeast. The 6870 works out of the box with no issues.

I have the odd issue with the system not waking from sleep, but turned it off since I use this system as a file share anyways. Sound is a little crackly if the machine is restarted; setting the output format from the default 196,000Hz to 96,000Hz fixes it until I restart again. I'm sure this could be automated with a script of some sort, but haven't bothered to look into it.

Hi all, looking to build a dual boot Hackintosh to replace my old Early 2008 Macbook Pro which is struggling to keep up.

&amp;#160;

I'll likely be doing most of my gaming under Windows. Really looking forward to playing Diablo III once my finals are over. From looking at benchmarks it seems like I'll be able to run it with maxed settings at 1080. Same with Starcraft II.

&amp;#160;

Most of my normal usage will be on OS X. I do a bit of web design here and there so I'll be running Photoshop concurrently with Dreamweaver and other apps. I have a bit of a bad habit leaving a bunch of applications open, so I'm guessing I'll need more RAM.

&amp;#160;

I'll also use it for some bedroom DJ'ing running Traktor, and I'm starting to learn production so this computer will be my DAW as well. I haven't really decided on whether I'll be using Ableton or Reason yet (perhaps even Logic or Fruityloops if I run it under Windows).

&amp;#160;

So I guess my questions to you guys are:

&amp;#160;

1. Does all my hardware look compatible with each other and with installing OS X? I got the MoBo off the Tonymac list so I assume that's fine. Does the manufacturer of the graphics card matter or will the XFX card be just as compatible as the Gigabyte one suggested by Tonymac?

2. I know it's recommended to have two HD's for dual booting, and I plan on it eventually but I'm a poor college student. I plan on getting an SSD and using the 500GB as storage. Is there any negative to having both OS's on the same drive other than not being as easy to set up?

3. How is my power supply? Sufficient?

&amp;#160;

Thanks so much!",,False,,t5_2quen,1337100843.0,,,True,t3_tofb5,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/tofb5/build_help_first_build_dual_boot_i5_for_gaming/,

* 2 750Gb SATA drives
* Antec Lanboy Air (Don't laugh, I'm getting a new one sometime. It was cool for about 5 minutes, but I'm going deaf, plus it's filled with dust).

I built this machine about 9 months ago with the intention of building a hackintosh / windows gaming PC. Snow Leopard was a partial success, but some things bothered me (sound wouldn't work right, I could only have 4gb RAM installed). So I used it as a pure Windows machine until the drive started failing in my 2006 iMac (again) the other day. 

I attempted another Snow Lion install, it failed (8 gig RAM), so I attempted a Lion install, which was painless after the 3rd attempt. I mostly screwed up the drivers in MultiBeast.

A few things I found out along the way:

* On my particular motherboard, SATA drives need to be plugged in to the blue plugs, not the white ones. 
* Don't blindly install all the audio drivers in MultiBeast - the system will panic upon boot.

This thing screams compared to my 2006 21"" iMac Core Duo (of course). It feels more responsive than Win 7 and any of the 30 linux distros I tried on it. 

Todo: 

* Fix up bluetooth (I have a D-Link DBT-120 dongle that's supposed to work, but it isn't)
* Reinstall my Win 7 drive and set up chameleon to dual boot
* Find some utilities to monitor temperature sensors

1325044528.0,11,self.hackintosh,nt59w,[Build Complete] I hacked my wife's new custom PC.,14,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/nt59w/build_complete_i_hacked_my_wifes_new_custom_pc/,"A month ago I posted a [build](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/mi5oy/build_complete_graphic_design_workstation_for_my/) on [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc) regarding a new Graphic Design workstation I built for my wife. She was initially thrilled with it until she started using her Wacom tablet. Wacom has some pretty heinous [bugs](http://forum.wacom.eu/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=3050) in Windows 7 that render the tablet nearly useless. She was, understandably, distraught and stopped using the PC completely.  
  
That was until today when I finally had some time to hackintosh her PC and get it running 10.7.2 using UniBeast, a 10.7.0 dmg extracted from the Mac Store download, MultiBeast, and the 10.7.2 Combo update. Everything went pretty well. I had some issues with MultiBeast stepping on its own toes (it creates a locked folder on the desktop for two seperate kext installs. If the folder exists already the updates will fail, so the second of the two kexts always fails on install... sigh) and audio didn't work out of the box.  
  
I also have, for now, scrapped her RAID storage array. I'm not sure what I'll do with it for now. I think I'll make a Time Machine Backup of her system and then mess with the settings and see if I can get a RAID array working.  
  
Also, the M4 is working great without TRIM. I saturated the drive with data using the following bash script:  
  
    let MAXFILL=90  
    let CURRENTFILL=0  
    touch junk.big.old  
    echo ""This is a Junk File"" &gt; junk.big.old
    while [ 1 ]; do
        CURRENTFILL=`df -ah | grep -w / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed -e 's/%//'`
        if [ ""$CURRENTFILL"" -lt ""$MAXFILL"" ]; then
                cat junk.big.old &gt;&gt; junk.big.new
                cat junk.big.new &gt;&gt; junk.big.old
        else
                echo ""Disk at $CURRENTFILL%, aborting...""
                break
        fi
    done  
  
Allowing this script to complete will write data to 90% of your hard drive, and will effectively FORCE garbage collection to begin. I then ran some disk benchmarking software from [AJA](http://www.aja.com/ajashare/AJASystemTest.zip) that measures the speed of your disk. I saw no discernable difference before and after the drive was full, meaning that garbage collection is doing its job. Phew....!  
  
Anyway, I've run out of umpf to write this, I'm tired. It took longer than I expected and its late. But if you have any questions about how I did it or if you have a similar system (especially the same or similar GA-Z68XP motherboard) feel free to ask my any questions.

When I got the idea in my head to build a Hackintosh, I literally had no clue what I was doing or where to start. Thanks to Tonymac's amazing forum and tutorials on youtube, it went pretty well. I won't lie though, I ran into a couple of problems and had some serious doubt as to whether or not I was going to be able to do this more than once. But I stuck it out, and I'm happy to say that I've got my first ever Hackintosh that seems to be functioning at close to 100%. (I do not have bluetooth or airport yet, but I've already found some great guides to getting those slight issues resolved.) Hopefully this beast of a machine stays up and running properly. That's kind of part of the excitement though...I guess...sigh...

Anyway, here is my build:

-Antec Three Hundred Case
-Gigabyte X58A-UD3R 
-3.2 Ghz Quad-core Intel i7 960
-6 GB of 1333 Triple Channel Ram
-1GB 5770 ATI Radeon GPU
-60 GB OCZ SSD
-1TB HD
-Run of the mill Optical Drive
-H50 Water Cooling System on the CPU + 3 more 120mm fans

Here is my advice, as a person going from not understanding anything about computers to one who still barely understand shit but somehow managed to build a working Hackintosh...

1) Read A LOT before buying parts and building your computer. I probably spent close to 3 weeks researching my build and how to build a computer before I invested the $1200 this machine ended up costing me. I'm very glad I did. And, even still, I ran into a few problems while building.

2) Don't get discouraged. I ran into one problem with the iBoot+Multibeast route that literally took me around 5 straight hours to solve. Honestly, I'm still not all that certain exactly how I fixed it. I have a feeling most people run into at least one problem like this. Just power through that shit. You'll figure it out if you keep going.

3) I spent so much time researching where to buy the cheapest version of the parts I wanted. My conclusion is that Microcenter is the best place to buy most parts if you have one close by. I bought my CPU for $179, when it was literally $100 more everywhere else. The only things that weren't cheaper at Microcenter were the H50, the power supply, and the Optical Drive...

4) Anti-Static Wrist Strap. It's a safety precaution, but a $5 safety precaution that's well worth it. Also, it should go without saying, but don't build anywhere near carpet. 

That's all I've got. Just thought I'd drop by and let everyone know that building a Hackintosh is totally possible, even if you've never had prior experience with any of this. Just do your damn research!

So everything works but sleep is wonky: waking from sleep using keyboard seems to kill usb devices. I had to unplug my keyboard and plug it back in to be able to use it. I also have to turn my BT mouse off and then on again. However, waking using the power button works fine (but I still have to run my mouse on and off). Auto sleep works fine but I still have to on/off my mouse. Other users with this board have not reported any sleep problems (which makes me sad). It's got to be a DSDT issue.

**Intel Core i7-970 Gulftown 3.2GHz Six-Core Desktop Processor - $564**
I've heard this matches the performance of the of the 8 core Xeon Mac Pro configuration. Video editing programs are really good at taking advantage of multiple cores, but is it worth investing the premium on this when the quad core Intel i7 950 is half the price?  

**GIGABYTE GA-X58A-UD3R LGA 1366 Intel X58 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard - $209**
People have suggested the UD5 over the UD3. Don't really know which one to choose.

**COOLER MASTER Storm Sniper SGC-6000-KXN1-GP Black Steel, ABS Plastic, Mesh bezel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case**
It comes with one 120mm rear fan, one 200mm blue LED top fan and one 200mm blue LED front fan. 

**G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10666) - $84**
It's a pretty decent start. Definitely needs to be upgraded eventually to take advantage of tripple channel.

**COOLER MASTER Silent Pro M600 RS-600-AMBA-D3 600W ATX12V V2.3 SLI Certified CrossFire Ready 80 PLUS Bronze Certified - $79 with rebate**
I have no experience buying a power supply so if you have any suggestions, let me know.

I currently also have two 500GB drives running on a Raid 1, which this 3TB was supposed to replace.

I've tried unhooking everything except my macHD and the new drive, and it still won't boot. I also tried one with the windows HD and the new drive, and nothing. If I unplug the SATA connector but leave the power plugged in, it will boot so I know its not a power issue.

Any thoughts?

I have just finished my first hackintosh. I had thought about doing it years ago but the asus p5ne-sli motherboard did not have much support.

I stumbled onto the [tonymac86 website](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php) where the buyer's guide was especially useful.

My system 

* Intel Core i7 3770K

* Noctua NH-D14 CPU Cooler 

* NZXT PHANTOM Full Tower case PSU White 

* Thermaltake TR-800P TR2 RX 800W 

* Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H 

* SanDisk Extreme SSD 240G 

* TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 

* Corsair 16GB (2x8GB) 

* Asus GTX680 DirectCU II Edition PCI-E 3.0, 2GB 256-bit DDR5

I installed mountain lion 10.8.2 and used multibeast to setup with some settings I dug out of some forums. I had a few issues before I switched to the chameleon boot loader. Also the first time I ran OSX for some reason my user had no admin access, so I had to reload and start again.

The only issues so far is the motherboard I have is a ver 1 which has issues with the green audio output port but the black one works. Also I have no idea to get audio via hdmi. Also my pc keyboard (logitech g110) and mouse (logitech G9x) do not wake the computer. Instead I press the power button and log in.

Apart from that my computer is great. Still waiting on a blue tooth dongle and a compatible dvd drive.

I am very happy so far. Part of me wants to upgrade to 10.8.3 but I don't want to break my setup. I think I might build a mini for my lounge room.

Also my room mate who has a mac book pro is eyeing a system for herself so maybe that will be the next project.",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_1ayxb6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1ayxb6/my_experiences_building_my_first_hackintosh/,

Downvote me if I'm breaking any rules, but please consider helping me all the same**

On to my problem: I'd like to know how to get iMessage to work in a VM. I know this is a common problem, caused by Apple blocking hacked versions of OSX and unregistered machines alike.

I'm running Mountain Lion in VirtualBox in Windows 8 (on a Dell Latitude E6410, if it makes a difference). I used the [iAtkos method](http://www.macbreaker.com/2013/01/iatkos-ml2-mountain-lion-virtualbox.html) to do so. All the other iCloud services function normally, and I have purchased a legitimate copy of ML if that helps.

I've heard there are some solutions to hackintosh users that involve changing sections of the Chameleon program, however, I'm not sure iAtkos uses Chameleon and that the fix would work (please correct me if I'm wrong). So, if a solution similar to this does work, I'd love to hear about it. Please give me any links or instructions if an iAtkos fix exists. I need all the help I can get: while I'm no amateur, I'm also no expert and need instructions to be as explicit as possible.

Some things to note, the part list doesn't include mouse/keyboard, monitors, speakers, and internal HDDs for storage... as I have all of that already. Also I plan to overclock the GPU, as well as maybe getting a second one for SLI in the future, hence the higher wattage PSU (although I'm aware SLI doesn't work in OS X).

I have emailed a well known iMac modder named Dremel Junkie (http://www.dremeljunkie.com/) and he responded with a rough guide on what should be achieved. Previous commenters asked if I can post my progress or any information and I thought I would follow through before really working on this project with the amazing information I learned from Dremel Junkie.


**Here is the email:**
&gt;The LG LM201W01-STB2 is a 16:10 CCFL backlit 20.1"" 1650x1080 LCD panel that uses TMDS signaling and is found in power pc iMac 20"" G5s with iSight cameras.  To do this mod, you really have to understand the basics of LCDs and what TMDS vs LVDS (or the older TTL) signaling is.  LVDS is the most common standard excepted by LCD panels themselves (some of this has to do with not having to pay license fees for LVDS).  So you plug a DVI or HDMI cable into an LCD controller and that controller coverts that signal to LVDS. During this conversion the controller can adjust the image (ex contrast, saturation etc).  The controller is almost always powered by a DC power source - and it gives the LCD panel this LVDS signal as well as the power needed to turn the LCD on.  There is another thing the controller does, it tells the backlights to turn on.  The backlights are ccfl or led bulbs behind the LCD.  The image would be too dark to see without a backlight. The backlights are powered by the same power source via an inverter.  In fact in many monitors, the power source and inverter are fused together on one board using the AC current directly from the plug.  In other monitors with CCFL backlights DC from the power source passes through an inverter where it becomes AC with a very high voltage (and is dangerous).
&gt;
&gt;The iMac G5 iSight panel you have works slightly differently.  It accepts TMDS signals.  Examples of TMDS include both HDMI and DVI.  So to put it simply, the 30 pin JAE connector on the back is really just a female DVI or HDMI with the pins rearranged (plus some other things). So, there is NO LCD CONTROLLER! Well there is, it's just not visible.  Inside the monitor is a Texas instruments chip that converts TMDS to LVDS, so in a way the controller is part of the LCD.  The all in one iMacs could do this because they only accepted one channel using one type of signal (didn't need a board to switch between VGA and HDMI for instance).  The motherboard also hooked right into the inverter, so it controlled the backlights directly.  The alteration of the image (ie contrast, hue, saturation) was handled on the motherboard side by software controls.  This allowed for the Controller to be simplified enough to be put in the LCD itself.  But, as I stated before the controller also gave the LCD it's power. As the controller is inside, the power to the LCD is supplied by the motherboard via other wires in the 30 pin JAE connector.  So the 30 pin JAE cable going to the back of your LCD has to supply these channels in its pins:
&gt;
&gt;DVI/HDMI Image Channels using TMDS.  There are 4 TMDS image channels.  They are 0,1,2,&amp;Clock.  These are red, green, blue, and clock. Each of these is made up of a 3 wire bundle with includes a positive, negative, and a shield.  So, 4x3 =12.  In addition there are some regulatory wires called clock, data, and vedid that comes from the dvi/HDMI pins as well.  Again these are the actual pins in the dvi/HDMI connector going to these pins.  So we have 15 pins now.
&gt;
&gt;Now let's talk about the LCDs power, you need 3 - 12V wires and 3 grounds = 6 pins.  15 + 6 = 21, 9 are not connected.  Now, there is also a trick you have to do to the DVI where the source comes from to get it to know its connected, but that is explained in detail in the 20"" mod.  So here is the Pinout.  Ignore the colors (they are for iMac g4 identification only).
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;And here is the 20"" blog post.
&gt;http://www.dremeljunkie.com/2011/11/all-in-one-20-imac-g4-genuine-tmds-to.html
&gt;
&gt;So now, you must be thinking ""mine has a controller"" but that isn't the controller it's the inverter.  I don't know the exact order of the wires off hand but the inverter works exactly as the iMac g4s does.   The 4 extra connectors you are describing are the backlights.  There are 6 backlights 2 of which are supplied by the 2 - 2pin connectors.  The other 4 are supplied by 2 - 4 pin connectors (they are 4, not 5 pin).  These connect to the inverter which connects to the motherboard and via motherboard to the powersource.  The Mobo turs on the backlights and you need a 24v power source.  I do not know much about the g5s PSU and if it can be used.  But I discuss options and have the Pinout of the wires that go to the inverter in the same post.
&gt;
&gt;Some options:
&gt;Wire it up individually - you'd need a 30 pin JAE connector with pins that connects via TMDS wire (from HDMI or dvi cable) and then connect both the inverter and LCD to an adequate power source.
&gt;
&gt;Use the guts from an aluminum 20"" apple cinema display.  This contains the wiring already made, a power source in the form of a power brick which supplies the necessary 24v as well as a ""controller"" type of board (though this board doesn't convert to LVDS as I noted above) but it does downconvert the single 24V received to all the necessary voltages and control the inverter.  Sometimes you can get lucky and find one with a broken display for very cheap or find the individual parts.

I currently use a slower fsb processor, but my 1600mhz options for the highest end are x5482 or even x5492 if i wanna get two 3.4 ghz xeons!

I obviously know how to power down and install new processors, but my question is what will happen on the first boot? Will it simply boot and my  ""About This Mac"" will display the correct processors, as well as my system profiler?

will it boot without problems?

will i have to boot and somehow use software to update and have my hack pro detect the new processors?

This summer I decided to install it anyway as most of the compatibility issues were gone. I've been changing some components on the way and the build looks like this now: 

* Asus P8P67
* i5 2500K
* GTX 560ti
* 8Gb 1600mhz ram
* Crucial M4 128gb for Mountain Lion + apps
* Crucial M4 128gb for Windows 7 + games
* Samsung Spinpoint 750Gb for photos and videos
* Iomega 2Tb external for movies and TV shows
* Random 160gb for Time Machine
* Belkin Bluetooth adapter 

Keyboard and trackpad are Apple and the mouse is Logitech Performance MX. The mouse is using Logitech's own bluetooth adapter but with the keyboard and trackpad I had a little trouble finding a working adapter first. This one worked the best for me: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Bluetooth-plus-Adapter-range/dp/B001BRV7JE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345923464&amp;sr=8-3

The install was pretty straight forward, I used VMWare to make a bootable USB drive for installing Lion and after the install I used Multibeast to install kexts. In order to get audio working I needed to use a custom DSDT. 

Then after a month or so Mountain Lion was released and I just updated Lion to ML using an updated Unibeast and everything went well. With ML I now have native support for the GPU.

I am basically at the 6:30 mark in that video I posted above, I have not installed the files he is referring to at that point.

Right away, OSX wanted me to run updates, the kind where you install, shut down and restart. I cancelled at the moment, because I wasn't sure if it would screw something up.

I've noticed this for a while about my hackintosh, it will become totally unresponsive if left untouched for a few days. I last used it on friday and come monday it appears to be running as normal (lights on, fans going) but the screen wont come on and it has disappeared from the network.

I use screen sharing from my macbook to connect to my hackintosh quite a lot but it also will not work. I did look for any errors or problems in the console when it first started happening but nothing stood out. The only other possibly related problem I have noticed is that it will not sleep indefinitely, it always wakes itself at some point.

This has happened with 10.8.2, 10.8.3 and now 10.8.4, the specs are:

i5 3570k


gigabyte ga z77x ud5h

gigabyte gtx660

128gb ssd windows

2 x 160gb hdd's osx and a backup of osx

2tb hdd

Any ideas would be great, thanks.

Edit - all usb devices receive no power, no signal on display, not on network, dvd drive opens. Disconnecting / reconnecting usb devices has no effect.

Edit - After following the advice to turn off sleep the same thing happened, I had left display sleep on so I will try with that disabled. The console did have a lot of these errors towards the end:

It uses a different way of booting into the Mac OS and is incompatible with the majority of hardware available. **The idea is to find a set of compatible/similar hardware and install the OS onto it. The latter being the most difficult.**

There's no reliable way to check if the hardware you currently own would be (partially) compatible or not. **The best way to go around this is to use known/recommended builds from others.** That's the first part.

Regular motherboards will not boot into this OS from standard media. You need to add a step in between. **This steps lets you boot into an environment where the Mac OS thinks it's installing into a Mac, and not a PC.** After the installation, you need to install corresponding drivers for your hardware, as the OS itself restricts itself to a certain set of hardware.

So.. **Get compatible hardware, make bootable media, install media via special method and install drivers. Then you can boot off the internal drive you've installed the OS onto.** Is this correct?




Now I have some concerns. I read some things about the Unibeast/Multibeast method, where you need to leave the bootable media plugged in, in order to even boot the system. Is this true? And if so, is there to eliminate this requirement?

Now I've already tried this Unibeast/Multibeast method, but I simply could not get to the installation screen. I enabled the verbose (-v) and it stopped around the part with ""AppleUSBEHCI"" and not being able to ""enumerate a device."" I tried with the safe mode command (-x) and ""USBBusFix=Yes"" (I don't even know where people get these commands from), and it froze at the ethernet part. Googling doesn't give me any results, and I really don't have enough understanding about troubleshooting these specific errors.

I'm using Mountain Lion, my board is the Intel DP55WG. I've found some people having success on their DP55WG board, but it was with older methods and OS. I figure the newer OS/versions would be more compatible.

Anyway, I'm just kinda at a lull here. My next attempt will be with an older OS to see if that works out.

**update:** With my DP55WG mobo and GTX 550 ti, I had to use ""GraphicsEnabler=No -x"" for Lion and it worked. I had to use ""USBBusFix=Yes -x"" for Mountain Lion. The reason it didn't work before was due to an improperly made installer/usb drive. I need to maintain the USBBusFix to use my system properly and remove GeneratePStates (and C) from boot options.",,False,,t5_2quen,1372372911.0,,,True,t3_1gumqp,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1gumqp/i_think_i_understand_this_but_correct_me_if_im/,

As I'm sure many of you know, the 10.8.3 update added Radeon HD 7xxx series compatibility, but it doesn't work ideally. There are a few ways to get them to work, and here they are: 

* Use the clover bootloader [Link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/)

* Use the sleep trick. If you have a system with functioning sleep, when you get the white screen as you log in, hit the sleep button. Click, and everything should be working. 

* Use the rotate trick! here's a guide! [Link](http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/92710-10-8-3-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-testing-thread-25.html#post579839) 

* Now that you have the rotate trick going, have it happen automatically on startup. [Link](http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/92710-10-8-3-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-testing-thread-27.html#post580654)

* If you have more than one monitor. You have to use this little trick. [Link](http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/92710-10-8-3-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-testing-thread-26.html#post580027)

* If the rotate trick isn't working, here's a guide to editing/troubleshooting. [Link](http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/92710-10-8-3-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-testing-thread-25.html#post579959)

I fixed it by putting the OSX boot disk in the first SATA slot, before the Win7 boot disk (I did have the Win7 boot disk in the first SATA slot). The other day I upgraded to Win8, and had to change some settings in the BIOS to allow it to install Win8 from the DVD drive. Now whenever I start up, it always tries to use the Win8 drive. I've tried to set the BIOS settings back to what they were, but I guess I'm getting them wrong. Is there some trick to getting it to boot from the OSX boot disk by default? It doesn't even show up as an option when setting the boot priorities in BIOS.

For reference, the mobo I'm using is the UD5H.

I'd really appreciate some help, it's frustrating having to hit F12 to get the boot menu every time I restart.

Anyway, that is my build, the GTX 560 Ti is NOT the OC'ed version, however it is all Gigabyte sells anymore, so I put it as the next best thing.

Any glaring issue?  Could anyone point me in the right direction to find the DSDT for my motherboard?  (I seem to find a lot of DSDT's for the PRO and Deluxe version, but not that specific version).

 Also, I have a quick question. Would it be viable to use this setup with the Hard Drives?

SSD: Boot for both OSX and Windows

1 TB HDD: Data for OSX and Windows

320 GB HDD (salvaged from laptop): Ubuntu boot/data


Or would I have to do a set up like:
SSD: Boot for windows

1 TB HDD: Data for Windows/OSX boot+data

320 GB HDD: Ubuntu boot/data.

Or would neither of these?  Sorry, I'm new to the Hackintosh world.

Thanks in advance!

Quick EDIT: My CPU is slightly OC'ed, would I have to take it down?  Thanks again.",,False,,t5_2quen,1359704995.0,,,True,t3_17oiuh,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/17oiuh/first_time_hackintosh_viability_of_things_listed/,

I did that and it looks like it was successful but when I try to boot up in verbose mode I get the long list of code and then the screen goes gray, then blue.

Okay, I thought it would be nice to write a quick basic guide for installing Hackintosh on an AsRock Z77E-ITX with a GTX 680 GC 4GB from Galaxy. 

Okay! So let's get started for what to expect from this,

----The Rig---

My Specs are,

CPU: i5 2500k @ 5.0Ghz (I over clock but you don't have to.)

MotherBoard: Z77E-ITX using the Modded 1.60 Bios

GPU: GALAXY GTX680 GC 4GB (I would actually recommend a 2GB card, as OPENCL Is a pain in the butt to get running on 4GB cards)

RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2x4GB 1600Mhz CL9 Kit (What ever you want, depends on what you want to do with it.)

SSD/HDD: OCZ Agility 3 120GB (OS) + OCZ Vertex 3 120GB (Data/Scrub) (I know I did it backwards but I already had the Agility 3 mounted and I couldn't be bothered to switch it around after I installed the OS.)


----THE PRE-INSTALLATION----

Okay, first and foremost I would recommend that you set up your bios so that you can easily install OS X and get things working with minimal issues.

1. I would reset your bios to stock settings so that the bios install will go without issues, because a bad flash is BAD.

2. Download the modded bios from HERE(http://bios.zmac.net/asrock/Asrock-Z77E-ITX-160_modified.zip)! and throw it on a flash drive so that you can pull it up later.

3. Install it. Just use the flash utility on the board it should just detect the bios file. After you install let it do it's thing it will flash on and off, don't touch it, it's doing what it needs to.

4. After it installs, be sure to set your Disk management to AHCI and to set the shared memory of the iGPU to 32mb otherwise it will kernel panic.

Now you are good to go to the REAL install phase.

---Install---

There are two methods to this,

1. Make a mac that can install Mountain Lion and Unibeast. &lt;--- The Manly way.

2. Have a mac that can install Mountain Lion and Unibeast. &lt;--- Preferred


---Install Method 1---

This is the method for if you are starting fresh you have no Macs around or you can't be bothered to get one, I salute your inability because I had the same issues as my sisters Macbook Pro is in the shop and I couldn't be bothered to wait to get it fixed.

---Installing Snow Leopard---

WHAT YOU NEED

A Snow Leopard install disk

A DVD Burner / Drive

An iBoot Disk image(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

A CD

You will want to burn the iBoot Disk Image to a blank CD using any sort of ISO Burner.

Set your bios to Boot form CD-Rom First so you can easily access your iBoot every time.

Once you boot to the iBoot CD you will want to take the disk out and place the Snow Leopard disk in the drive. Once you do so hit F5 until ""Mac OS X Install Disk"" appears in the menu. Before you select it be sure to type ""PCIRootUID=1"" Otherwise you will get a gnarly kernel panic and you will have to reboot.

Now that you are greeted with the installer you will want to open Disk Utility and format your OS Drive for Mac OS Extended (Journaled) make sure that you set the partition to GUID. I named it OS for sake of this. After you do so just install OS X to the disk OS.

Once it finishes and restarts reinsert iBoot disk back into the drive.

Select ""OS"" or whatever you named it and type ""PCIRootUID=1"" again. It should boot up into OS X Snow Leopard.

You'll get a cool welcome screen and will be asked to set things up, do whatever it doesn't matter as you will be reinstalling anyways.

---Updating to 10.6.8---

What you need.
 
1. Mac OS X 10.6.8 ComboUpdate(http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1399)

2.MultiBeast http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads

3. Update Helper(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)
If you are awesome like me and you have a Sandybridge processor you will need it.

4. Broadcom Kext(Driver)(http://www.osx86.net/view/1883-broadcom_bcm57781_lion.html)

Now you will want to open MultiBeast and mount and install the combo update. DO NOT REBOOT!!!!!! Switch to MultiBeast and if it closes re-open it.

Now you will be in MultiBeast get to the customization menu it is after the ToS agreement. You will want to use

1. EasyBeast

2. System Utilites

3 Customization -&gt; Boot -&gt; PCI Root ID Fix

Install it 

Eject iBoot

Restart

---Install ethernet driver---

Now you will want to ins all your ethernet driver so you can have internet to download mountain lion. 

Go to your applications folder and open Kext Helper Drag your Broadcom Kext into the white box and install.

Restart and you should have internet.

Now you can continue to Method 2

---Method 2---

You will need:

1. A Download of Mountain Lion form the App Store a tormented copy won't work.(Mac App Store
)

2. Unibeast 1.6(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

3. 8GB or larger flash drive

---Creating a Bootable Disk---

Open Disk Utility

Select The 8GB Drive

Select partitions

Click current and set it to 1 Partition

Click options and set it to Master Boot Record

Name it USB

Format it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) 

And apply.

---Uniibeast---

Open Uniibeast and follow the prompts skip the prompt about legacy and laptop support it's not needed.

Boot from the USB and select USB from the Unibeast loader.

Partition your drive using Disk Utility make sure it is one partition and is using GUID partition method as well as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format, I have named mine OS. After you partition exit and install.

Restart

Boot again from USB this time choosing ""OS""

Since the Z77e-ITX doesn't have ethernet support from UniBeast you will need to download these files from another computer.

1. KextHelper (http://code.google.com/p/g60jx-hackintosh/downloads/detail?name=Kext%20Helper%20b7.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=%22)

2. Mountian Lion Ethernet Kext (http://www.tonymacx86.com/attachments/golden-builds/32446d1348410006-asrock-z77e-itx-core-i7-3770k-evga-gtx-570hd-ionetworkingfamily.kext.zip)

3. USB 3.0 Kext (http://www.tonymacx86.com/general-hardware-discussion/70384-hopefully-near-universal-usb-3-0-driver-3rd-part-controllers-10-8-x.html)

4. Working Audio DSDT File (You will want to rename it to DSDT.aml) (http://www.tonymacx86.com/attachments/golden-builds/41179d1355596164-asrock-z77e-itx-core-i7-3770k-evga-gtx-570hd-dsdt.aml.audio.zip)

5. Multibeast for Mountain Lion (http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

--Installing Kexts and Other settings---

Using Kext helper install the the Ethernet and USB 3.0 Kexts.

Open Multibeast. use the settings as listed here (http://www.tonymacx86.com/members/buckeyes1995/albums/hack-stuff/41177-multibeast-settings.jpg)

After that finishes copy the renamed DSDT.aml file to the /OS/Extra folder

And there you go you should have Mountain Lion working with minimal issues.

---Appstore Fix for SandyBridge---

1. add the following to your org.chameleon.Boot.plist:

&lt;key&gt;device-properties&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;4b00000001000000010000003f0000000100000002 010c00d041030a0000000001010600031c0101060000007fff 0400160000006200750069006c0074002d0069006e00000005 00000001&lt;/string&gt; 

2. In System Preference-&gt;Network remove ethernet/wifi devices

3. Delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist

4. Reboot

5. In System Preferences-&gt;Network add ethernet THEN wifi

I am still undecided on the RAM, PSU, and GPU.

RAM: I'm not sure if losing 4 GB is worth saving $18.

PSU: I'm not sure if the 430W 80 PLUS will be better than the similarly priced 70% efficiency 550W

GPU: I'm not sure if the slight upgrade on the GTX 650 is worth $30 over the GTX 550 Ti 

Looking to keep the build in the $500 range. I'll be running OS X, Linux (Ubuntu or Fedora), and Windows (7 or 8).

This is my setup:
A Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H Motherboard 
An Nvidia 660Ti Graphics card 
An Intel i5 3570K CPU

The problem is I can't get dual monitors to work on my 660 Ti card.
I installed the NVIDIA Fermi &gt;2GB Open CL patch
I installed the NVIDIA 670/680/690 Support patch
I have installed 10.8.2

But I still can't get a second monitor plugged into my graphics card to come on.
If I just have my HDMI cord attached and boot everything boots fine. If I plug in the HDMI and the DVI it just boots to a white screen on the HDMI side and does nothing on the DVI side.

I have my bios display settings set to ""peg"" (vs. IGFX or PCI)

What am I doing wrong? Have other people gotten dual monitor support working with the card?
Please advise.

Every single time theres a new piece of hardware coming out or a new OS I tell myself I'll hold off.  Well, tomorrow is the day and by the looks of it Apple is going to fall short of the build I've put together.


My primary objectives with this machine are


• Light gaming in Windows 8
• Running several work critical VMs in Paralles (Win 2K-Win 7)
• Photoshop &amp; Illustrator
• Fast application launching
• Eventual use with Thunderbolt Display
• Serving media to Apple TV/Xbox 360


Case: Corsair Obsidian Series 550D *(allegedly quiet)*

**OS X Boot Drive:**  2X SAMSUNG 830 Series.5"" 128GB SATA *(Raid-0)*

**Data Volume:**  2X Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 6.0Gb/s *(Raid-0)*

**Backup Volume:** Seagate Barracuda Green 1.5TB 5900 RPM SATA 6.0Gb/s *(Partitioned 128GB for CCC of the boot volume and 1TB of the data volume - the rest will be misc FAT32 storage)*

**Video:** MSITi GeForce GTX 660 Ti 2GB *(for light gaming on a 1920x1080 IPS dell display using display port)*
**Power Supply:** CORSAIR Professional Series Gold AX750 (modular and allegedly quiet)

**RAM:** CORSAIR Vengeance 32GB (4 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 *(you can't have enough ram, should I go faster than 1600?)*

**Motherboard:** GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UP5 TH LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 *(thunderbolt, usb 3.0 - listed as golden)*

**CPU:** Intel Core i7-3770K Ivy Bridge 3.5GHz *(3.9GHz Turbo)* (planning to OC)

**Cooler:** CORSAIR Hydro Series H60 High Performance Liquid CPU Cooler *(for overclocking and noise reduction)*

**Misc:** Apple USB 2.0 keyboard *(open to wireless suggestions)*, Linksys WDN4800, Logitech Performance MX


For the time being I'll use a few 5400rpm drives for Windows and likely upgrade to a raid-0 SSD after the holiday.


Questions: Most of my questions pertain to the thunderbolt display.  I'd like to be able to use the thunderbolt display in OS X with the 660 Ti acceleration and OpenCL.  There is something to be said for FaceTime and I'm absolutely a huge fan of using iChat for remote support for family.  I'd like to know that the Thunderbolt Display will work with this build even though I'll initially be using the build with a Dell Display.  Also, how easy is it to setup a hackintosh with a software raid-0 as the boot volume?  Is this stable?  Even though I have a Macbook I'd like to make this machine my primary workstation and stability is important.  I plan to keep routine backups of the boot volume incase something goes awry for a quick restore but this machine will otherwise be considered 'mission critical'.

Tomorrow is the day that I will likely decide to pull the trigger!  I'm excited and nervous; I've been a forum member for years but I'm locked out of my account for some reason (I know there was a technology transition recently).

Also, there is a FireWire port on the front of my case-- will it hook up to my motherboard, or will I need a separate pci to FireWire connection? Most audio interfaces today are FireWire or USB, and I prefer FireWire for more audio inputs.

Whenever I boot into OS X, I get an error that says ""the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer"", which seems to make sense to me because Lion can't read ext4.

http://hacksbyalfa.tumblr.com/post/24389831290/thunderbolt

* No Thunderbolt
 * This is due to the the DSL3510, and DSL3310 (Cactus Ridge) Thunderbot chips having not OS X support. The new Macs that are soon to be release have a high likelihood of using one these chips since they are the newest generation of Thunderbolt chips. Once those Macs have native Ivy Bridge ( PCIe lanes ++) support they will mostly likely have support for these Thunderbolt chips.
 * “The beauty of Thunderbolt is it’s near invisible to the OS. You don’t need to install any drivers to take advantage of it, just plug your devices in and as long as your devices have driver support they’ll just appear. The OS has no idea that your SATA, Ethernet or RAID controllers are sitting a few feet outside of your box, they all appear as normal PCIe devices.” [Link](http://www.anandtech.com/show/5829/a-first-look-at-thunderbolt-on-windows-with-msis-z77agd80/)


* App Store works. iCloud does not, due to the use of BridgeHelper.
 * Should be fixed with Apple’s offical Ivy Bridge support.
 * Messages Beta does not work
* Video works flawlessely tested using Diablo 3
* Digital audio works. Analog not tested

Sorry for the disappointment. But I'll be sure to keep you all updated. In the guide I said I'll answer questions on TonyMac, I'll answer questions here too... At least I'll try ;)

* Intel i7 2700K
* Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 v1.3, Firmware F10
* Gibabyte Radeon HD 6850
* Corsair 16GB 1600Mhz DDR3
* Corsair Professional 650watt modular power supply (expensive, but I often find bad power supplies to be the cause of many computer headaches)
* Corsair 120GB SSD
* Sony Optiarc DVD-RW AD-7280S

As I have a compatible motherboard I used the latest Kakewalk followed by MultiBeast with [this configuration](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7155386508_2e65da8ef4_b.jpg). Once MultiBeast was run, everything seemed to work: audio, ethernet, etc. as best as I can tell.

I'm encoding some video at the moment and WOW, this sucker is FAST!

A few quirk on the install:

* The 16GB Verbatim USB key that I used for the install is quirky as it only works in some of the USB ports. Other USB sticks work just fine. As a result, I had to try multiple ports before I could get the Kakewalk loader to find and use the image (I kept getting a ""still waiting for root device"" error).
* [FIXED - see below] When I restart the machine I *sometimes* get an automatic restart during POST. It will get to the screen where it's about to load into OS X and instead power off and power back on. By all accounts this is a hardware issue as it happened before the SSD was even installed. Any ideas?

* I'm looking to improve boot times. The OS X boot is great, but half the boot time is just getting through POST.
* I'd like to tax this thing to really test its stability. Any suggestions?
* Bluetooth is a must. I'm off to research some dongles.

A big thanks to everyone on the other thread! 

UPDATE:

* My Geekbench 2 score with no tweaking is 13200
* I have full Bluetooth functionality using a Belkin F8T003 dongle
* The computer survived a 6 hour Geekbench 2 stress test with no averse function
* The restart during POST was fixed by enabling Quick Boot in the BIOS

My last machine was built on a Shuttle SB86i barebones!

I just bought the following setup off of a friend:

Intel i7 2700K	
Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3	
Gibabyte Radeon HD 6850
Corsair 16GB 1600Mhz DDR3
Corsair Professional 650watt PS
Corsair 120GB SSD
Sony DVD

He bought it as is supposed to be a great Mac Pro like build. A bit of browsing on Tonymacx86 and here indicates that that is indeed true. Alas, I'm lost as where to begin in installing Lion. rBoot,?DSDt? Can somebody point me towards a how-to for like hardware? Any direction is much appreciated.

UPDATE: MANY, MANY thanks for all the replies! I've decided to use Kakewalk but I'm still having an issue. It boots into Kakewalk and eventually tells me ""still waiting for root device"". I've switched USB ports, tried an older BIOS (F9, but when that didn't work I applied F12), formatted the SSD using Disk Utility on another machine, moved my SSD from the 6GB/S SATA to the 3GB/s (which is where it's supposed to be anyway, apparently). Alas, no joy. I have not tried Chimera (still dunno what it does) but may per Beowolve's suggestion.

UPDATE 2.0: I'm in OS X! I needed to move the USB stick to a different USB port for some reason. I'm now playing with multibeast to get the internet working. So far, it's wicked fast!

I built this tower months ago for BF3 but did my tonymacx86 homework prior to building for this moment. I'm ready to dive into OSX86!

My #1 issue - Hackintosh instructions seem so... unorganized. So many tools/terms such as iBoot, Kakewalk, rBoot, MultiBeast, xMove, kext, DSDT, yada yada. I'm inclined to try kakewalk first as it seems to be the easiest, fastest approach. Please help me navigate the boat loads of information out there!

Please help me navigate the sea of information. **Major** concerns:

1. **HDD config** - Currently I use SSD for Win7 boot+BF3, 320GB drive for Windows programs, and dual 1TB drives as Windows Mirror drives (not hardware RAID) holding music, movies, documents, backups, etc. I intend on using the 250GB drives for mac boot, programs, etc. 
**Question**- Can I use my current 1TB mirror array as a single data volume in OSX in similar fashion?! Can't risk corruption or breaking my mirror setup. 

2. **USB Boot drive vs internal SATA** - I'd love to be able to use the 250GB OSX drive as an external HDD via USB. I'd put the drive in an 2.5"" drive enclosure and boot from it when I want to use OSX. This is way less invasive than having to install the drive in the tower, recable, etc etc. **Question** Can I use a 2.5"" drive as an OSX USB boot volume? 

3. **Snow Leopard vs Lion** - I currently own Snow Leopard retail disc but have not upgrade my original 2006 macbook to Lion. Its incompatible. **Question** Any objective reason to use Lion over Snow Leopard with my setup?

I'd been running my hack previously, but reconfigured all my hard drives, and ended up rebuilding the OS X OS drive.  Specs are:

* i7 870 2.93 Ghz O'cd to 3.6Ghz
* Gigabyte P55A-UD4P Mobo
* 12GB RAM
* Dual Diamond 6870's in Crossfire
* 2x 128GB SSD drives (one for Win7, the other for Lion)
* 2TB Caviar Black storage drive (Win7)
* 2x 1TB Seagate Barracuda drive (one for OS X, one shared)
* Rocketfish Bluetooth Dongle for keyboard/mouse peripherals.

Overall the install was very easy.  I created the Unibeast USB stick with my copy of Lion from my MBP, booted with the stick and installed.  After the install, I updated using the software updater (I know, not recommended, but it's worked that way in the past for me.  Guess I'm just lucky there) and ran Multibeast.  I edited the .plist for Chameleon to hide all my non boot drives, so the bootloader is nice and clean as well.  Finally, I loaded up VMware Fusion to use my Win7 drive as a Boot Camp drive.  No issues there either!

Happy to answer any questions.

I put mac on the big drive and windows on the small one. [Here's a crappy shot of the guts.](http://i.imgur.com/vb9NS.jpg) I need too work on the cables a bit, but so far its works. 

This amazes me, [system info in mac osx](http://i.imgur.com/U2mur.png). So crazy to me, coming from a much older intel macbook pro, its fast. And speaking of fast...[Geekbench score is clocking in over 10K in mac](http://i.imgur.com/q5DLu.png). I don't have 64bit Geekbench for windows, but I'm getting scores about 500-1000 points less in Windows 7 currently, which is weird, not sure why that is. 

So...build complete, and so far its awesome. Only snag I'm having is some issues getting my Apple LED Cinema Display working. The only thing I could find to let me connect it was the [Atlona AT-DP400](http://www.atlona.com/Atlona-Dual-Link-DVI-to-Mini-DisplayPort-Converter-USB-Powered.html). It's pretty cool, but the problem is, it uses USB to power itself, so essentially you dont see any screen info on the Apple Display untill it gets power from the USB on the mobo, meaning the screen is blank during the whole startup phase, so you can't browse your BIOS or basic setup info, which also makes it tricky if not impossible to dual boot. So essentially...stuck with the cheap Dell screen I got Best Buy for the time being.  

And one last note, I plan to overclock this thing. Just haven't done it yet. Wanted to make sure I got everything up and running nicely before I risk destroying it all, haha. Right now, I get on average temps between 30C-50C. The highest it went was after a few too many hours of Skyrim.

500W PSU was included with the case which was actually a Cooler Master 431 Plus.

The build went well until I tried to power it up for the first time, all that was happening was the fans spun for a second and then everything shut off immediately after. I finally realised that I had failed to connect power to the CPU. As soon as that was sorted I installed Lion alongside Windows 7 on the SSD and she is flying! 

So handy to have the functionality of OSX and the ability to play the casual game on Win7 all on the same system.

Also, I have thousands of dollars of mac software licenses, and replacing that would not save me any money in the long run. Plus the time converting all my old files.

My main issue is that I am not exactly computer-savvy. I know enough, and I can follow directions. But I by no means know my stuff. 

Is it crazy for me to go the Hackintosh route? Is it doable? Should I just get a pc? Are there people who offer consulting services on such things?

Here's the logic behind my choices:

* I knew I was going for an Intel processor and nVidia graphics for hackintosh compatibility reasons, even though AMD would have been more bang for the buck performance-wise
* I went with mini-ITX because I plan to keep the machine on top of my desk rather than under it
* I went with Haswell because OH NEW SHINY
* I went with the cheapest quad-core Haswell because it seemed like a good compromise between cost and performance
* I went with the Gigabyte wifi mobo because it's hackintosh compatible out of the box

Not listed/different to what's listed: 

TP-Link PCI Express Wifi Adapter
Corsair Carbide 500R case, instead of the one I've got listed on PC Part Picker, because the Carbide 500R isn't on PC Part Picker

Should probably mention that this is my first Hackintosh.

I've spent quite a while on the forums at tonymacx86 reading up on the logistics of building a machine like this, and while the dual-boot OS installations look a little complicated, I shouldn't have any trouble if I pick the right parts.

Sticking pretty much entirely to the buyer's guide there, I've come up with a part list:

My thinking here is to have a separate HDD for each OS. The case has room for extra HDDs or SSDs when I might need them. Music Production, particularly large scale orchestral work, needs maximum RAM and top of the line processor to run large sessions and high quality sample libraries.

I have a few questions before I go and drop too much money on this thing.

1. Firstly, does anyone see any incompatibility issues arising from this build?
3. Is this build going to overheat and die on me without a CPU cooler in there? The case I've chosen has 4 fans included and space for 7 more
4. Does anyone know the best place to buy within Australia, or should I just go from the US Amazon store? Will any of these items not ship to Australia from the US (I've checked and they all seem to be ok for shipping, but I may have missed something)?


Any other feedback or advice that anyone has is very welcome as well.

1365976837.0,6,self.hackintosh,1ccla1,[First Build] Hackintosh for a professional photographer,8,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1ccla1/first_build_hackintosh_for_a_professional/,"I'm building this hackintosh for my girlfiend, who is a professional photographer. She regularly works with photoshop files that are close to 1GB. She uses lots of photoshop and  also does the occasional video editing in Final Cut Pro. I'm not exactly sure what the most important parts would be for her uses, but I imagine that CPU, memory and a decent video card are up there. If possible I was hoping to keep the price tag under $1,000.

Any opinions of the build below? Should I also look into getting a smaller SSD to keep the OS and programs on?

Thanks!

So, this was my first Hackintosh build. I had an Acer Eee PC 1000HE that I was working on. There just wasn't enough support to go around with it (might give it another shot since I understand a little more now). Then I went from trying to get it working in a VM, but regardless of having a AMD Bulldozer, virtualization did not want to work. From there, I tried going the AMD route (har har, funny, right?). I had a ton of trouble. I eventually got it going, but it was just a hassle to get anything done with the hardware I had.

The need to run OSX was getting to me. So, I did a lot of research on motherboards (and those that Fry's had in stock) and headed out. Bought (most of the component sans DVD drive I had available) and went fast to building. Got all the way done and started with Lion since I had that on hand. Well, apparently Lion just FLAT OUT refuses to run on this hardware. Long story short, bought Mountain Lion and installed without a hitch. I got everything working minus sleep (the graphics card I suspect). She runs like a beaut.

I have a couple hard drives from my old regular PC build that I swapped into here. Reformatted them 379GB (NTFS)/121GB (GUID) and SuperDuper!'d my OSX install from my SSD to that specially partition so I could install Windows 8 to the SSD (I mainly did that just to see since the motherboard is designed for Windows 8 and wanted to check out boot times).

It's 'jerky'. As in when I open mission control or try to show desktop, it doesn't do it smoothly - kind of jerks into place. Likewise it freezes a bit buffering Youtube videos etc. Seems stable otherwise, just seems to have a bit of a hard time with certain things.

RAM configuration conflicting with DSDT? Badly configured sound driver, or incorrect graphics config?

I will be attempting a hackintosh build on a 3770k and a compatible Gigabyte motherboard. I currently have a 7950, which I love for gaming in Windows.

Since the HD7xxx series is not currently hackintosh-friendly, I was wondering if it is possible for me to install an Nvidia card in my system, and have OSX use the Nvidia card (ignoring the ATI), and vice-versa in Windows (use the ATI, ignore the Nvidia).

Is this doable, and if so, how?

1356493358.0,7,self.hackintosh,15g85v,Advice with Dual-Boot Slave Sample / Gaming Rig,10,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/15g85v/advice_with_dualboot_slave_sample_gaming_rig/,"Hi all. I'm a Mac-based musician looking to treat myself to a slave audio PC that could also double as a Hackintosh depending on how things go. I have a fairly old Mac Pro (3,1) as my main rig, and as I am increasingly using demanding orchestral samples, I decided that I needed to offload that work using a slave machine running Vienna Ensemble Pro. From what I've heard, PCs are less problematic and better overall when it comes to this brute force audio processing, so that's why I am mainly just putting together a PC. And, since I'm getting all new hardware, I figured I'd throw in a decent graphics card as a present to myself. Nothing crazy or OC-able from what I can tell.

However, I'd like to leave the option of going Hackintosh and running my samples through OS X if possible - purely for the sake of consistency. Also,  I do need Lion or Mountain Lion to be able to sync my damn iPhone, but I'm deathly afraid to update from Snow Leopard on my main rig because of the software problems that might arise. So there's some motivation to get the Hackintosh aspect up and running!

I've been doing some research, but I still have so many questions about how it's all going to fit together. Below I've posted a possible (and incomplete) parts list. I've left out some hard drives, the case, sound card, and optical drive - I'm not sure about the direction I'm taking the first three, the last one I won't need at all. Oh and I'll be using my existing keyboard through a KVM switch.

The biggest questions and notes are the following:

* The ability to have tons of RAM drawing from my SSDs is the most important aspect of this build - now, should I go with a future-proof 2011 socket so that I have the option of bumping up to 48GB or 64GB when I (possibly) need it, or should I stick with 1155? Would other bottlenecks such as processor cores/speed be more of an issue when I'm juggling that many samples? Also, new 2011 CPUs are coming out next year...

* Should I bother with faster/different RAM? Worth it?

* *Heat / Silence / Case:* I'm not going to overclock, but I am interested in keeping this machine very quiet. 1) What case might offer a good balance between noise-dampening and air flow? 2) Do I need any extra cooling for when I'm pushing my RAM, and if so, what would a decent, quiet-ish solution be?

Thanks so much! Looking forward to jumping on post-Xmas sales!

Also I checked my BIOS and made sure that the correct SSD was set as a boot option.

Any help would be truly appreciated. Thank you.",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_12l6cx,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/12l6cx/need_help_repairing_boot_loader/,
1350921212.0,10,self.hackintosh,11wemb,Help! Impossible to setup RAID1 storage on dual-boot Lion/Win7??,12,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/11wemb/help_impossible_to_setup_raid1_storage_on/,"I've asked in the [OSx86.net forum](http://www.osx86.net/10-7-lion/19166-help-hardware-raid-storage-possible.html) as well as the [tonymacx86 forum](http://www.tonymacx86.com/general-help/54010-setting-up-raid-0-dual-boot-windows-7-mac-osx.html#post475197), but no responses came in over the weekend... maybe Reddit will help me out?

**The Why:**
My wife's hackintosh is dual-booting Lion/Win7 both from the same physical disk (SSD). For all of her work, I made three partitions on a second disk; one for OSX (HFS+), one for Windows (NTFS) and one to share (exFAT). Recently, the exFAT partition corrupted. I recovered 98% of everything, but my wife wanted me to make sure that wouldn't happen again. Naturally, my thoughts turned to RAID1.

**The Goal:**
I'd like to setup a RAID1 so that the entire disk is mirrored and the logical drives look the same as they always did in both Lion and Win7.

**Steps taken so far:**

1. First, I bought and installed an identical HDD.
2. My first go-to was to RAID with hardware using the motherboard. As soon as I swiched away from AHCI, OSX wouldn't boot. I fixed this by adding *0x28228086* to the IOPCIPrimaryMatch key of the AppleAHCIPort.kext Info.plist.
3. Once I had things booting with the BIOS set to RAID, I actually created a RAID. It worked perfectly on the Win7 side, but Lion didn't recognize the RAID (they still show as two disks).
4. I tried using the disk utility to create a software RAID on the MAC side... but there are two problems to that: it destroyed the HW RAID and it wouldn't let me setup an exFAT RAID.
5. After searching the web and coming up with no help, I turned to the above-mentioned forums.

**Hardware:** 
Z68MX-UD2H-B3 v1.3 (Marvell 88SE9172 SATA controller)

**Ideas:**

* I read somewhere that this might be possible with the on-board controller if I get the right AHCIPortInjector.kext? Does that exist?
* Hardware-controlled RAID is possible if you go buy a 3rd party RAID controller, right? (As long as you aren't booting from it...)

Or is this effort truly a pipe-dream?",,False,,t5_2quen,1350922727.0,,,True,t3_11wemb,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/11wemb/help_impossible_to_setup_raid1_storage_on/,

I decided to stick somewhat to Slugnet's Golden Build since it seemed well documented:

http://www.tonymacx86.com/golden-builds/70530-slugnets-video-editor-ga-z77x-ud5h-i7-3770k-gigabyte-geforce-gtx-660-ti.html

And I ended with these parts:

MB: Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H
 
CPU: i7 3770 (No overclocking for me)

RAM: Corsair Vengance 16Gb (2x8Gb) DDR3 1600MHz

GPU: Gigabyte GTX 660 Ti

SSD: Crucial M4 128Gb

HDD: Western Digital Black Caviar 1Tb

ODD: LG DVD writer

PSU: Corsair HX650W

Case: Corsair 500R

So I followed the tonymac unibeast guide:

http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html

First, I updated the BIOS to F14 and the only setting I changed was to switch the xHCI mode from Smart Auto to Auto. After plugging the the usb stick and booting from it, I was getting the grey apple screen with the circle with the slash through it so I switched to a different USB port and I got it to go to the Disk Utility and I reformatted the SSD with the Mountain Lion Partition.

After, I installed it but when it reboot, I got stuck on the Grey apple screen with the flashing circular pattern. Few things I noticed from the BIOS was that the default boot option had a UEFI designation and the Slugnet guide said that wouldn't work so every time I started the computer, I would manually boot from the USB stick (I also tried booting from the SSD which I had on Port 0 and it didn't seem to be any different than booting from the USB stick).

I ended up checking the verbose boot and found that it hung with the last line being ""[IOBluetoothHCIController][start] -- completed"" but when booting with safemode, I managed to get in. While in safe mode, I used Multibeast to get the NVIDIA GTX 670/680/690 Support drivers (the guide mentioned that 660Ti support was implemented so the other drivers were not needed and the GraphicsEnabler should be set to YES) and that is where I am at now.

I still can only boot in safe mode and It will not start without the USB Drive plugged in. Also, I cannot do a clean install by booting from the OSX installer on the USB Drive since it gets stuck at a Grey screen with the spinning rainbow wheel so unless I pull the SSD out, buy a USB connector and wipe the drive from a different computer, I don't know what to do.

Thanks for reading through and I hope, I am just missing something obvious but I followed the guides as closely as I could and it seemed to have produced completely different results.

I'm working on putting together a parts list to build a hackintosh, and I'm stuck on what graphics card to get. First of all, I'm not sure whether to go with an AMD or NVIDIA card. Which would be more compatible? [Relevant tonymacx86 link.](http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=57215) 

Assuming I go with an AMD, which card should I get? I'm thinking of something in the 6000 series, maybe 7000. I'm getting an ASUS PA246Q monitor (1920x1200) and I want to be able to run games (like HL2, Portal 2, TF2, Oblivion, Bioshock, etc. plus some new ones that might come out) at fairly high settings. The problem is that I really have no idea what the specs on graphics cards translate to in real life. Someone told me that high resolutions eat VRAM for breakfast, so I should get a 2GB card. Other than that, I have no idea - the main distinguishing factor seems to be number of stream processors. [This table for AMD](http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=88&amp;pgno=4) and [this one for NVIDIA](http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=88&amp;pgno=8) would have been very helpful, except I didn't know what was important. What should I be looking for in a card?

I want this to be a pretty future-proof build, so if I wanted to get another monitor or two later, I wouldn't have trouble. I'm assuming I'd need a second card for three monitors, but would I need another one for two? Also, I'm thinking of getting the [Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128545) mobo - would I have issues with a second card, since they would then only be running at x8 instead of x16? The other option is the [G1.Sniper 3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128552), but it's $90 more for basically just a faster second PCI slot. Do I need that?

One last decision is what brand to get. I read [on a forum](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/116409-13-which-brand-graphics-card-good-gameing) that there were a few brands that seemed to be the best, but I also have to worry about hackintosh compatibility, and [osx86project's hardware compatibility list](http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/HCL_10.6.8) is sadly lacking in variety for higher-end cards.

So, what knowledge and suggestions can the hivemind give me on the subject? Thanks!

Special thanks to rplush for the format for the list, I was lazy =)


When I had bought all my parts, I had ordered an XFX 6670 Radeon as well as a Gigabyte Nvidia GTX 550 Ti. I could not get either of those cards to work as I'm not good at hex editing and I don't understand most anything other than installing kexts and dsdts. I plan on returning those two cards and am looking for a good card to upgrade to later on, but for right now this works in both windows an mac the way I want. Also I inadvertently bought the MA instead of the MX motherboard, so kakewalk didn't work as planned. Got it running but had all sorts of problems… this began 3 days of tinkering between working my job.

Before installing, I used  kakewalk, to partition 80gb to Windows 7. I had a nice unstable system going after I installed, so I decided I to go ahead and install windows 7, use Easy BCD to set up dual boot, then I could get to both. I tinkered with my kakewalk install for awhile before deciding to scrap it. Tried the Unibeast method, couldn't get past the load screen to the installer. Tried kakewalk again and suddenly I couldn't do ANYTHING on the OSX side. Searched for awhile, and found something called [My Hack](http://myhack.sojugarden.com/guide/). 

The flash drive installer is as simple to set up as any of the other methods, and just plain worked. Lion installed flawlessly (10.7) and then I ran multi beast and used a tonymac dsdt for my f9 board. 

All in all this thing flies. I had been using my macbook pro (late 2008) as a desktop for the past year (hooked up to wireless keyboard and dvi with an external cd drive) since it would no longer hold a charge, and in all honestly looks like someone dropped it down a flight of steps. This upgrade was honestly well worth the price and I can honestly say it runs faster than my stock apple hardware on that laptop. I have been using it for about 4 days now, and there are no issues to be found. I'm able to switch over to win7 to game using the boot loader installed by multi beast (hit a key during and switch to my ntfs partition)

Everything shows up like it should, works like it should, and I can't say enough about how stunned I am that MyHack worked when the other installers failed. It's always great to have a backup plan, so if anyone is having issues with other install methods, give it a shot, worked for me.

Side note, I'm terrified to do the 10.7.3 combo update for fear of it breaking things, I may clone the drive and give it a shot later on, but for right now, 10.7 it is.

If anyone has a suggestion for a good gfx card (make/brand) I should should go with for a low to mid range price with good punch that is easy to install let me know, I want it for my windows side, what I have now works for gaming fine.

I like the build tutorials from [nofilmschool](http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/), this one made from [varient3](http://varient3.com/2011/09/video-editing-hackintosh-final-build/), and the [tonymac custo builds](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/search/label/CustoMac), but this graphics card thing is causing my brain to fry for no reason – and I don't know much at all beyond the specs.

The main programs I want to use are:

• Final Cut Pro (7, not X, at least for now)

• Adobe Creative Suite (particularly AE + PS)

• Cinema 4D.

I would like to toy around with Maya, Houdini, and a few other programs.

Would I be better off going for the ATI cards?

So I am pretty much bugging out. pretty excited and pretty nervous. First time computer build and hackintosh. 

Total with shipping was about 800. 

Here comes the total noob question number 1

1. Do I need to install snow leopard before upgrading to 10.7?

2. Is there a link somewhere on tonymac (that I can't find) for this exact build. Like the settings and what not. Is Kakewalk easier for this build or the Iboot+multibeast.

So I plan to start with this on Windows 7 and eventually get 2 SSD's to boot Windows and OS X separately. My main concern is the 580. I read [here at tonymac](http://tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=28975&amp;start=0) that it's possible to use the 580 (even works in SLI, but I'm not going that far), but I was wondering how hard it is to make it work. I want to keep the 580 to game on the Windows side @ 120Hz but am willing to sacrifice it if you guys know of a card that can play 1080p games at max smoothly (&gt;60fps). Or, is the 120Hz monitor too much? I wanted to try 3D gaming eventually, so I figured I might as well get the 120Hz monitor out of the way now.

Also, I went with the 2500K because I'm eventually going to OC, but that's down the line. Stock cooler is fine for me for now.

1gb Gigabyte 6850 (plugged in with HDMI)
OCZ 600w psu
500GB 7200rpm Seagate drive

Here is what I've tried so far. Coming from 10.6.8
- Dowloaded 10.7 from app store
-Tried unibeast for app store method, and usb method. (downloaded unibeast to rule out a corrupt download. tried 4 flash drives:Patriot Xporter 16gb, Kingston 1gb, Microsd card in USB adapter 8gb and 16gb)
-Turned a Flash drive into a Lion bootable drive.
-Tried xMove method. First few times it failed, then I mounted the ESD and it went through. 
-Tried getting to the installer through chimera
-Tried using multiple USB ports on the front and back of the tower. 3.0 and 2.0. 
-booting installer with different flags (-v -x -s PCIRootUID=0 GraphicsEnabler=No and combinations of each)


My results:
-Black screen, then reboots
-Frozen Grey screen with apple logo, no spinning gear
-Grey screen with apple logo and spinning gear into a kernel panic. 
-1 second flicker of the Grey screen with apple logo, into a reboot.

I have matched All my bios settings to the guides. I have checked and rechecked. Another thing that is strange is that I can boot to snow leopard with iBoot, but if I try to set the hard drive as the startup drive I get a kernel panic. Also, booting to snow leopard from Unibeast drive gives a KP. 

I spent about an hour this morning getting from 10.6.3 up to 10.6.8. That was around 8AM. Now it's 5:35pm and I'm no further and it's a bit frustrating to have wasted that much time. ANY help is much appreciated. 

Only thing I've left to try is updating my BIOS and/or redownloading Lion. Which I'll do if there aren't any other ideas. Also, I'm heading to the store to get a DVI cable in case HDMI is somehow an issue. Not sure how it could be, but I'm desperate. 


EDIT: Problem was my BIOS. If anyone else has this problem, for the love of God, update the BIOS! Also ran into a problem where Lion installer said ""This version of 10.7 can't be used with this computer"". Update Chimera and that fixes that issue also.

*I also read somewhere that DSDT edits are almost always better for upgrading to a new version of OSX without having to change much and I'd prefer to make this thing run perfectly by adding the hex code to the DSDT to enable my dual GPU's rather than the org.chameleon.boot.plist.*

For the sake of getting this thing running before I actually break down and try to edit (or have Tonymac edit) my DSDT, I think the culprit is either my in.plist file used to generate the hex string, the hex string itsself, OR how I am copying the hex string into my org.chameleon.boot.plist file in Extra.  It might also have something to do with weird quirks that Gigabyte boards have where you need to boot from PCI slot #2 (""PEG2""? or am I misinterpreting this step?), though I have tried that a few times too.  

**Here's my parts list:**

* Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD7-B3 motherboard (Firmware 9)

* i7 2700K 3.5Ghz CPU

* 2x 250 GB SSD's @ SATAIII speeds (Corsair Performance Pro for OSX and Vertex 3 for the Windows 7 boot drive I'm using to type this)

* 32GB of Corsair Vengeance 1866Mhz RAM

* 2x GTX-580's with 3GB of RAM (connected with SLI ribbon cable, though it's definitely not a necessity to have SLI in OSX...in fact I almost prefer to have them connected without SLI due to software requirements).

* Tango FW800/USB2.0 card

* 4x Kingwin SATAII hot swap drive bays

* 1200 watt Corsair Gold series

* Antec P183 Case

* Corsair H60 Liquid CPU Cooler

The graphics card is my old Zotec 9800GT 512MB and I'll upgrade that next. It works fine with TF2 which is all I play lately. The three WD 750GB drives are in Raid0 for video work. I also had another Samsung 2TB internal HD for music and movies but had it move it to a USB 3.0 enclosure as this motherboard only has 6 SATA ports. I wish I had noticed that before buying as the external 3.0 drive cuts out from time to time on Lion.

The upgrade only cost me $540 to go from a Core 2 duo system to an i7 with 16GB of RAM. This is why I love building my own PCs. The difference in time waiting for a render between my old and new systems is huge.

My Case is the earlier 690.

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/dGfwE) (not much to look at). I know my cabling sucks but temps are low, even with the stock cooler and overclocked to 4GHz.

Using the Chimera bootloader as I had real trouble with EasyBSD.

Everything works great except USB 3.0 which cuts out, and the keyboard needs to be unplugged and replugged-in after sleep.

Edit: Running OS X 10.7.2.

Thanks in advance guys.

TL;DR What kind of hoops do you have to jump through to set up a hackintosh system, and how compatible is it with Pro Tools?

I will also be adding a 1.5tb hard drive that I currently own as well as a 27"" apple cinema display and an LG 1080p monitor that I currently own. I wanted to get 3 displays, but I think 2 is enough for now.

On the Motherboard: This was the hardest part for me to catch. Not only did it have to be compatible with every other piece, it had to be compatible with OSX too. I finally settled on the one in the list, and I hope it's not too much of a bottleneck. Let me know!

Yes, yes, 16gb ram. OMG SO MUCH XD moving along...

I chose to have 2x 120 gb SSD as well as a 1tb HDD. I plan to install one OS on each SSD, as well as any valued programs, and then install all the files and folders on the 1tb HD. ALL of this will be backed up to the 1.5TB drive at least once a day, all of it sitting inside the chassis.

For the GPU's, I realize that OSX does not support crossfire or SLI, however when I do need to boot into the mac environment, I will rely on just one of the cards, as all my gaming will take place on my 7.

Also, I got the Disk Drive free due to the i7 :)

Well, please give me a good slap in the face if I have done something dreadfully wrong. And even if you disagree with my rantings here about my choices, tell me! I'd rather know and disagree than live in ignorance :)

Ive been reading over the FAQS on OSx86 and making some sense of this. It recommended following the specs of a mac pretty closely. My main use for the machine will be film work. So motion graphics, editing, vfx, coloring etc.. Really I only need it so that I have FCP and a few other mac things at my disposal (FCP, Compressor, Color and some other randoms).
Anyone have any good hardware recommendations? Ideally I want a i7 at least running at 3ghz. Video card will have to be an nvidia one that runs well with the Mercury Play back engine in Premiere Pro.
Here is the list for Mercury enabled cards.
The two areas I basically need help with are the CPU and Motherboard/Audio. It be nice to have some firewire 800/400 ports as most drives I get from clients don't have eSata. Is this possible? Im a bit clueless on sound- I dont need crazy sound abilities- but it needs to work properly. For the CPU its pretty simple.

But also I knew eventually i would have to buy a mac for uni etc and at this stage I really dont want to spend money on a ""legit"" mac. 

First off, would it actually be possible to dual boot it with an existing windows computer? I want to refrain from using VmWare (or any equivalent). I have a large HDD (2tb) which would mean it would have space to put multiple partitions; but i was thinking would I be able to run another HDD, one with Windows and the other with Mac? 

Second, probably the most important part -- the specs. I bought this machine specifically to be customized, with room for further upgrades. It currently has:

* Samsung SH-224BB/BEBS SATA DVDRW Drive OEM
* Antec High Current Gamer 620W Power Supply HCG-620
* CoolerMaster Storm Enforcer
* TP-Link TL-WDN4800 450Mbps Wireless N PCIe Adaptor
* ASUS GeForce GTX 670 DirectCU II OC 2GB
* Seagate Barracuda 2TB ST2000DM001
* Thermaltake Water 2.0 Extreme CPU Liquid Cooling System
* ASUS P8Z77-V LK Motherboard
* Corsair Vengeance CML16GX3M2A1600C10 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3
* Intel Core i7 3770K

If it isnt compatible Ill look into doing it on one of the laptops that i have. But I'd just like to say thanks in advance for any help.

1373306151.0,6,self.hackintosh,1hvlcp,Been out of the game for a bit... Need help putting together a PC that can double as a Hackintosh!! [xpost from /r/buildapcforme],7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1hvlcp/been_out_of_the_game_for_a_bit_need_help_putting/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

I'd like this to be a gaming machine with the ability to install the MacOS on it.  I absolutely *need* it to be able to play Bioshock Infinite on Max Settings with a bit of room to spare (I would like it to be able to run Infinite in an Oculus Rift) and I need the components to be workable for a Hackintosh setup so that I can run Xcode.  I also need to be able to run Unity well, but I don't think that'll be a problem for any machine that can run Infinite at Max.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

If possible, I'd like to spend less than $1000.  That's really the max I have right now so I'd like to spend less, if possible, but am also open to the possibility that I might need to wait and save up more.  Ideally, though, I'd like to be sub-$1000.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

Within the next week or 2, if possible.  I'll probably be ordering most of the components on Amazon, unless there's a reasonably priced alternative otherwise.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I don't need a monitor right now, keyboard, mouse, or OS.  I have a few Windows Vista and Windows 7 licenses for these machines (we're buying these for some development team members so they have updated machines to work with).  I have at least 1 case from a few years back, so if cases haven't changed much, I can do without needing to buy one of them.  The case also has DVD-RW drive, SATA cables, and HDDs that can be re-used if needed.  WiFi is a must and I don't have a WiFi card handy.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

US purchasing.  West Coast.  Can either be purchased in AZ or CA, but would prefer AZ if I can get this built within the next week.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Apple Cinema Display monitor that I'll be re-using (DVI) and possibly a power supply from Cooler Master (500W).

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Not opposed to over-clocking down the line, but, for right now, I just need the machine to run Bioshock Infinite at Max on an Oculus Rift with a minimum of futzing.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

No specifics except that it needs to be Hackintosh compatible so that we can boot into MacOS for Xcode.  USB3, Firewire, and Thunderbolt would be nice.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Low noise is cool but not required.  I have a case, so unless there's something vastly better or different from a standard ATX form case, I'll probably use what I have.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Yes.  I own a few unused licenses for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and I have Mountain Lion as the Mac OS.

What is the guesstimated lifespan of hackintoshes? Is it usually similar to the comparable iMac hardware going out of support cycles?

When updates do come out to OSX do you have to wait for tonyxmac to give the all clear before updating? Or can you proceed without much worry?

I am mostly a gamer and techblog reader. I do like OSX for the most part, but I am not dependent on it. The only OSX application that would hate to lose is ScreenFlow, and that is because I cannot seem to find its functionality on Windows.

Prices are slightly lower at TigerDirect online (isn't reflected on PCPartPicker), so I have decided to purchase my PSU, Motherboard, and Case there for $35, $95, and $20 after rebate. Total, it brings the price down to Around $660 not including taxes or shipping. 

However, I've been wondering if I could substitute buying the Z77 with [this](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=8022004&amp;CatId=6976) motherboard, as I have no use for Crossfire. Any thoughts?

Tips/Suggestions appreciated!

After finishing, I put my Mac OS X drive back on and proceeded to boot using a newish version of Chameleon (within a week recent) and I get ""waiting for root device"" as if the OS is not able to access the controller.

I would prefer not to have to swap the raid mode back and forth. I essentially want to be able to boot a single disk into mac while the computer is in raid mode vs ahci.

I've been using a Mac all my life, and I'm finally willing to not only get a new computer, but to try to build one myself. This is all completely new to me, and as daunting as it is, I feel like there's something (more than just a computer) to be gained from all of this (hopefully).

I've pretty much followed the CustoMac Pro build, not having the knowledge base to determine what would or would not work on my own. But before I commit to anything, I was looking for some input on what I should/shouldn't have, get, consider, etc. In terms of purpose, I'd like to be able to play games and watch movies (presently, neither of which I can do smoothly/enjoyably). I see no need to accommodate any heavy video/editing work.

Any input is appreciated.",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_1awbil,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1awbil/first_time_builder_completely_new_territory/,

From googling, researching on tonymacx86, and reading this very helpful subreddit, I've gleaned that the GTX 560 Ti works with Avid Media Composer releases below 6.5. And since I'm not planning on upgrading the software anytime soon, I'm hoping this card would suit my needs.
As for the processor, I'm gonna get a cooler once I need to overclock. Other parts like fw800 and esata cards I'll probably determine when to buy on an as-needed basis.

SleepEnabler.kext didn't help. Issue persists after removing all peripherals (aside from my USB wireless keyboard/mouse, which I need to trigger sleep).

Disconnected the Wifi PCIe adapter - didn't change anything. Swapped the nVidia GT640 for a AMD Radeon HD 6870 I had on hand, same thing.

Later upgraded to the UEFI BIOS for my motherboard, huge improvements in speed (plus no need for a DSDT anymore! :) Same sleep issue though.

By booting into a Ubuntu LiveCD on the same hardware, was able to confirm that this is an OSX-specific issue (not my hardware itself).

How does one get sleep working?

It has been working solidly for a few months, and now it cant stay on for more than 30 mins without freezing (sometimes grey screen, sometimes not), or me opening something that may trigger a grey screen. It seems to be mostly Chrome/Gmail/google that are triggers (all google tabs in chrome seem to be the first go ""Aw, Snap!"" on me), but even safari one out of 20 times won't do something right and crashes...and sometimes it beachballs and then I need to restart.

Also to add to this, when the system freezes (it's not always a GSoD), everything continues to work, the graphical interface freezes, if I have radio playing, it'll keep going (for hours) until I force it to turn off. Does that mean video card possibly? I'd imagine if it were the SSD, it'd stop completely...unless things are running from the ram...

Is there a way to run a diagnostic on it and post it here to see what is wrong? I ran diskutil, fixed permissions, flashed everything to the latest firmware, haven't redone driver packge installation since I haven't changed anything, and my plists are good to go. The spotlight was acting weird, so I turned off indexing - I know its not good for SSDs, but I use it a lot - that is why it was on. TRIM is enabled, other than that everything WAS working fine for months.

At first after reading I thought it might be the SSD (cause it seemed like bad ram/ssd behavior) so I flashed the SSD FW, switched the ram sticks over to different ports and orders. No go, same behavior so far.

So I'm writing this on the machine right now, everything seems to be working fine for now. I'm running the following hardware:

* Mountain Lion 10.8.2
* Core i7-3770K (no OC)
* Gigabyte Z77-UD5H (latest FW)
* EVGA GTX570 1.25GB
* Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR3 1600mhz
* Sandisk Extreme 240GB (latest FW)
* 2x 2TB 7200RPM Seagate in a mirror raid set
* Sony optiarc DVDRW
* Seasonic 850W GOLD PSU

Any ideas? Thanks for the help in advance! This has me going kinda crazy!

**Update:** I'm an idiot and forgot to turn off automatic updates...so it was downloading and installing things in the background without my knowledge. I may have to do a complete reinstall if I need chrome to work right ever again.

I guess my question now is how to carry over my Mirror RAID set without losing anything...do I do my re-install without the drives plugged in and then plug them in after everything is up and running? or do I have to offload them, redo it all and then load them back up?",,False,,t5_2quen,1362875397.0,,,True,t3_19zub8,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/19zub8/grey_screen_of_death_sometimes_odd_behavior/,
1362808011.0,8,self.hackintosh,19yjj6,Mac-like 4 finger swipe in Windows 8 tutorial,13,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/19yjj6/maclike_4_finger_swipe_in_windows_8_tutorial/,"After a good deal of research and effort I have enabled 4 finger desktop swipe on my Samsung NP700Z7C-S03 laptop.  This allows me to swipe left or right and jump to a different workspace.  I figured this might be a good place to post this because I went down the hackintosh road too and there's a good chance some of you may be interested.

First off there are requirements.  I have only tested this with my pc so I can't guarantee it for other laptops or even other versions of windows on this laptop.  But I'm guessing as long as you have Windows 8 (maybe 7) and an Elan (elantech) touchpad with at least 4 finger multitouch, there's a good chance it'll work.

First requirement: an Elan touchpad with at least 4 finger swipe.  You can either check online to find out, or possibly go into your Elantech install directory (C:/Program Files/Elantech for me) and launch the ETDDeviceInformation.exe.  Hopefully it's there for you as it was for me.  That will tell you how many fingers it supports.  Also any driver MAY work, but I'm using the newest samsung NP700Z7C touchpad driver available from Samsung's support website.  My version is 11.7.2.1_WHQL.

Next requirement: Dexpot 1.6.6, Build 2227.  Other versions or builds may work, but this is the one I'm using that I know works.  This is a free download from http://www.dexpot.de.  It is the program that enables multiple workspaces in windows.

Third requirement: Windows 8.  There is a very good chance 7 will work fine but this is the one I know works.  To be specific, Windows 8 Pro 64.

Alright, onto the process.

1. Install Dexpot
2. Load registry editor and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Elantech/SmartPad.  Make a backup of your registry settings just in case.  Make a backup of your whole OS if possible.  Do not change anything except what I specify.  Be aware that modifying your registry could make windows unusable so backup and be careful if you're new at that.  (Probably not a problem for this subreddit)
3. Open your Elantech specific touchpad settings UI and set it aside.
4. Open the Dexpot settings and go to controls on the left.
5. Change the following key settings to the following values if not there already:
FourFingerMove_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMove_Enable_Mode=0x00000000
FourFingerMoveLeft_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMoveLeft_Func=0x00000004
FourFingerMoveRight_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMoveRight_Func=0x00000003
6. Go to your mouse settings window you've opened and make a small change, and then change it back.  This should force windows to recognize the registry changes.  
7. Go back into Dexpot's settings/controls section and open the ""Switch desktop"" list.  Click on ""Next desktop"".  Check ""Allow hotkeys without modifiers"" and uncheck any modifiers.  Then click in the textbox underneath the modifiers.  Perform a 4 finger swipe left or right (depending on how you want it to function, I prefer left like OSX).  ""Keycode 167"" or ""Keycode 166"" should show up.  Do the same with ""Previous desktop"" but with the opposite swipe.
8. Click apply and try it out.

If Keycode 167 or 166 did not show up then either your drivers or hardware doesn't support it, or something got mixed up in the previous steps.  Check your drivers and retrace the steps.

I'm really hoping this works for other people.  I've searched high and low for something like this and failed to find anything, so I hope others can find this useful.  If you try it and succeed please let me know, especially if you're using a setup different than mine.  If you try and fail, let me know what didn't work and if I can think of anything to help I will.

Also it's not quite as fluid as OSX, but it's better than nothing in my opinion.  Also sometimes it doesn't work when certain programs are loaded and have focus, click on the desktop and try again.",,False,,t5_2quen,1362809038.0,,,True,t3_19yjj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/19yjj6/maclike_4_finger_swipe_in_windows_8_tutorial/,

I'm interested in installing Mac in VMWare 8.  I've seen a lot of guides that describe using a pre-built VMWare image, but I dislike that route for the following reasons:

- I have a legally purchased copy of OS X Lion
- I have no idea if they've rootkitted it, have keyloggers, etc.

However, rather than assume I've got everything figured out I'd check with you guys to see if I might have missed something along the way. This is the build I'm considering, primarily for the price/performance aspect. 

Just to make note, I already have the processor, HDD, SSD, monitor and keyboard.

Following [nofilmschool](http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/) as a guide, I've combined bits of the two suggested builds into something I think would be most beneficial for my dollar. I'm going with the i7 because it sounds like Pro Tools takes full advantage of the hyper threading, which is awesome because I'll be doing post-production audio. Here are my questions...

1. I went with the cheaper motherboard (instead of the Gigabyte Intel Z77) simply because I'm never going to use thunderbolt. Besides less SATA ports, am I right in saying there's really no other glaring disadvantage in doing this?
2. I'm not about to start editing Red camera footage ever... but I'd like to do simple film stuff, including 3D animation down the road. Therefore, I'm not too inclined to go for a high end graphics card, but is there a glaring better option that I should be looking at? Not even sure if I would use the CUDA-accelerated stuff, but I might as well pick the card that includes that if it's a possibility, no?

There are a couple of the small peripherals that I didn't list, and I'm going to wait to go for the blu-ray drive, but you get the gist.

It'll be my only computer and I'm going to do work with it so I just cannot afford an unreliable wifi or kernel panics and stuff like that.

Also - I'm thinking of buying an SSD and 1tb hard drive. Can I install both Mountain Lion and Win8 to the SSD and use the 1tb drive with both OS? Which filesystem should I use with the 1tb drive?

Regarding the rendering that will take place on the computer I was planning on an i7 16gig ram no GPU machine because I assume rendering is something that can take advantage of multi-threading and doesn't need a GPU. Am I right in saying this or do I need CUDA cores?

If this help the programs being used on the machine are Rhino3d, Maya, Adobe Illustrator and probably some other common ones.

I currently own a macbook pro, but it is starting to slow down, and I have decided that I want to get a desktop to provide myself with more power.  I had originally set my eyes on the new iMac (once it is updated in June), but between discovering the life hacker hackintosh guide and this subreddit, I have been rethinking this.  After doing a little research over the last couple of days, I thought that it might be cool to try my hand at this.  Now, I have NEVER built a computer in my life before, let alone a hackintosh, and to be completely honest, I'm not very good with computers in general.  

So firstly, I would like advice as to weather or not this is a good idea.  I was thinking that this might be a good summer project for myself, and I am fine with a tedious setup, but long run I don't want to be doing a LOT of tinkering (although some is fine).  Once you get a hackintosh to a working level, is there a lot of configuration that you have to do after the fact?  Or is this mostly in the setup?

Secondly, I have a build list that I would like checked over...generally taken for the tony mac pro build.  Just want to check that this is okay before I pull the trigger on any purchases:

CPU: Intel Core i5-2500k
MOBO: Gigabyte GA-Z68XP-UD3
GPU: AMD Radeon HD 6870
Drives: 60GB OCZ Nocti Series SATA 3Gb/s, plus a Seagate Barracude 7200 500GB
Memory: 16GB Corsair 1600Mhz DDR3
Power: Corsair 650watt
Optic Drive: Sony Optic

Lastly, through my research, I have found that wifi is sort of an issue for these machines.  I came across this guide to building a ""real"" airport http://x86wifi.blogspot.ca/2010/04/how-to-build-your-own-real-airport-card.html
Can anyone verify that this works?

Thank so much to anyone that can help or offer advice! I really need it...

I took a look at the FAQ and Tonymacx86's site, from which this build is directly taken (circa Sept. 2011). The [iBoot/MultiBeast](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html) seems like something I could handle. Here's my [PC build](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/gw36h/thanks_for_the_help_heres_the_build/) from last year, which was a huge success with the help of /r/buildapc.

This particular hackintosh build is to replace our aging Mac Mini. It is for one user, for internet, some MSOffice, and a billing program. The user is very insistent on this being a Mac, a Mini, and pretty looking. I might have to paint the case [white](http://i.imgur.com/VtgUO.gif).

* Open to suggestions for different parts.
* Is there anything else I am missing? I like the guides on Tonymac so I'll probably follow those.
* Are these hackintoshes particularly finicky once they are up are running? Do they need a lot of attention when Apple releases updates? The user is particularly skeptical of building a PC, but only opened up to considering it when the user tried the build I made last summer. If there are going to be constant issues with a hackintosh, the user would rather just spend the money on a Mini at Microcenter. We have a Microcenter nearby, at least. The user will also never let the builder down if this doesn't work.

Been looking around the sub for a while, and some really helpful stuff on here. I've recently completed a build (for Windows) and wanted to install OSX on it for work purposes. My setup is a Gigabyte GA-Z68AP-D3 Mobo, Intel 2600k and a Radeon 7970. I know the 7970 is nowhere near supported, but I do have an old 8800 which is. Would it be possible to simply plug this card into the PCI-E x4 slot on my mobo and use that over the 7970? Would it affect my Windows performance?

* GA P43T-ES3G
* Intel Core2Quad (Yorkfield)
* ATI Radeon HD 5770 (Sapphire)
* ASUS DVD Drive
* WD Caviar Black 1TB HDD

Here's how I got a clean install up to 10.7.1:

1. Burn iBoot, and place MultiBeast, xMove, DSDT, HDEF Update (found [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=235523)), 10.6.7 and 10.7.1 combo updates (on Apple's official sites).
2. Boot up with system settings for mac (AHCI, HPET at 64-bit), and boot to iBoot.
3. Insert Snow Leopard Retail DVD. F5.
4. Boot disc, and open disk utility.
5. Format the drive to Journaled and name it (I called it Mac OS X).
6. Install, reboot, boot back to iBoot.
7. Boot the drive, your computer's resolution may not be native (which is ok.)
8. Run the combo update 10.6.7, and move all utilities off the thumb drive to a folder.
9. Run the DSDT Auto Patcher and SAVE the .aml file as ""GA P43T-ES3G"". Run the HDEF utility, selecting EITHER 888 or 892. Both will work, but if you select 888, you will have to create a new DSDT when Lion runs.
10. Leave the DSDT.aml on the desktop and let the combo update finish.
11. DO NOT RESTART. Run MultiBeast, and select ""UserDSDT"", ""Repair System"", ""ALC8xxHDA"", ""AppleHDA Rollback"", ""FakeSMC"", ""Chameleon RC5 Bootloader"", and ""GraphicsEnabler=No"". Run it, and restart.
12. Remove iBoot, Chameleon should boot and run straight to Mac.
13. Open and download Lion installer.
14. While Lion downloads, open Disk Utility, and create a second partition ""Installer"" (you only need 8GB).
15. Run Lion Installer, and restart.
16. Boot back to Snow Leopard, and run xMove. Install to Installer partition, NOT YOUR SNOW LEOPARD.
17. Restart, and boot to Chameleon, selecting Installer. (If your computer boots, but nothing loads, except your mouse, GraphicsEnabler is set to yes, and you need to restart and run with that command).
18. Install successfully over you Mac OS X.
19. Boot into OS X, run Combo Update 10.7.1.
20. If you did NOT select 892 auto patcher, you need to pull back your original DSDT, repatch it with the 892, and run MultiBeast all over again (selecting the EXACT same options). Reboot.
21. Enjoy Lion!

I want to make a Hackintosh that also bootcamps Windows 7.

The reason the motherboard and processor are so cheap is that MicroCenter is running a deal where if you get a second generation Intel processor, (which was $40 off already) then you get a compatible motherboard for $40 off.

About to pull the trigger, I would just like some final feedback.

Is this compatible with Kakewalk? If not, how should I go about installing Lion? I've heard of tonymacx86 and BootLoader and MultiBeast but I don't really have a very good understanding of them.

What are kexts? What do they do?

I'm new to this particular subreddit and have read through some of your posts. Thanks for the helpful information! 

I'm planning on following the tonymacx86 build found [here.](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/08/building-customac-customac-pro-2010.html)

Here are some of the differences:

* Will be getting the i7 950 processors. I would like to overclock these a little bit.
* Would like to install more ram (about 12 gig)
* Will be getting a SSD drive
* Will be getting at least three 1TB drives (leaning to segagte) for a 1TB video RAID and a 1TB scratch disk. Perhaps a smaller and faster scratch disk?

I have a temporary ""wish list"" on NewEgg. I would appreciate your input. A few elements, like the processor and motherboard have been left off as I will be buying those for less at Microcenter here in Houston. I'm waiting until I can afford the workstation. I've been laid for for about 10 months now and trying to keep things going. I'm running my MacBook Pro (which was given to me) into the ground, I fear.

A couple of key points for my build:

I would like to get a video card that takes advantage of the CUDA improvements with the Adobe CS5 suite [http://forums.adobe.com/thread/609054](http://forums.adobe.com/thread/609054)

I shoot and edit a lot of HD footage with the Canon 5D. I also encode to h.264 / DVD on a regular basis. Processing power is very important to me.

So please, any input or guidance would be a great help to me. Thank you!

*Edit: I forgot to mention that I'm a little confused about TRIM with the SSD. I have read that OS X does not support this, but there are some drives they have it built in.

* UPDATE 1: Thankfully just as I got a deposit / contract for a large video project, NewEgg had a sale on the RAM and SSD HD I want! So, here is what I have ordered so far:

[SSD: OCZ SSD 60GB $99 after mail-in rebate](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227550)

i recently specced out and built one of tonymac's custom mac mini deluxe builds consisting of

1. GA-Z77N-wifi mobo with intel Core i7-3770 processor

2. 16 GB Corsair vengeance SDRAM

3. bit fenix prodigy case

4. Corsair **ENTHUSIAST** series 650 watt PSU

5. 1 TB Samsung Laptop SSHD (Hybrid drive)

6. **EVGA Geforce GTX 660 ti** (2GB)


I have had no problems installing Mountain Lion on this build and utilizing the onboard graphic card to tool around and work on the computer. in fact, it's pretty zippy even compared to my MBP with SSD.

the problem i've had is that my graphics card is NOT recognized at all after installing everything and then installing the graphics card (last step), so i'm stuck with onboard graphics. which is fine, but i do a lot of 3D and would really like to use the box as more than a render machine. 

i've gone the ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" route.

i've actually installed the evga card on a windows box (just to make sure that it was working) and it worked no problem. i also tried installing a Quadro FX 4500 (out of a spare Mac pro) in the Hack and it at least showed an image on screen (if it wasn't a little unstable bc i just threw it in the nvidia build just to see if the PCI bus was working on the mobo.

i've seen other people on tonymac with almost identical builds install the 660 ti on the Z77N with no issues at all. card works fine for them.

i really don't know if any of you guys can help, but if you can, i'd love some insight as i've sorta hit a wall on installing the card.

one question i had was ""do i need to flash the bios of the 660 ti on a windows box before installing into the hack""?

but i don't have the most access to a winbox.

the last bit of info i can think to give is that i have tried installing with builds of 10.8.2 with the nvidia drivers installed from nvidia's site.

a 10.8.3 build with no drivers installed from nvidia (bc from what i understand, 10.8.3 includes drivers for the 660 ti)

and also a 10.8.3 build WITH nvidia drivers installed....

all with no luck in recognizing the card. Mountain Lion installs fine though.

so at this point, i'm really out of my element as i'm not certain what's going on with my build (since others seem to have had no issues with that build) oh... and i also used unibeast/multibeast for the OS install.

so.... anyone have any thoughts? is there a ""p"" or a ""q"" that i'm not minding? is there a possibility that there is some other issue i am not thinking of?

sorry for the lengthy post, just trying to provide as much info as possible.

thanks in advance for any help you guys might be able to offer! if you need any questions answered for anything that may not be clear in my post, feel free to ask.

thanks so much!

What I've come to find out is: I was wrong. :)
There are many places where I thought things would be straightforward and they are decidedly not. He refers you to the instructions with different components that are either nonexistent or hard for a newbie to understand.
Anyway...
Does anyone have a step-by-step version of that build they've done? Or something very similar?
I had the preliminary components together per his instructions and was powering on to start tweaking BIOS... And nothing is happening.
I pulled the video card out and unhooked the bluray. Basically, I'm left with the mobo, CPU, cooler, 4 sticks of RAM and SSD. (I tried taking RAM out and putting them back in too.) All I get is a brief power up flash of LED and a tiny spin of the fans, then nothing.
Can anyone help?

* I don't know anything about motherboards. This one was on tonymacx86's guide, seemed compatible/an okay price. Thoughts?
* CPU vs video card balance? From what I've read I don't *think* I'll have a bottlenecking issue with this build. Should I consider downgrading video card and/or upgrading processor?
* Do I need an aftermarket CPU cooler? For the record, I don't plan on overclocking.

**EDIT**: Also, is it *really* that bad trying to run a Hackintosh off a Radeon video card? Cuz this [Sapphire 7970 3GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?SID=ZVVmANr8EeKQcZLRDiclhQ0_a6sb3_0_0_0&amp;AID=10440897&amp;PID=1225267&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-cables-_-na-_-na&amp;Item=N82E16814202008&amp;Tpk=100351SR&amp;IsVirtualParent=1&amp;cm_sp=) is *such* a sweet deal...and it's cheaper than the GTX I have below. I know it's complete overkill for someone like me though. But damn, I'd get it for the free Bioshock Infinite alone. :P And then I'd still have an extra 100 bucks to throw at the processor...

I have recently decided to build a PC because I really want to be able to game at maximum settings. I have built up so much trust and knowledge of the OS X operating system, I'm curious about how hard it is to make a hackintosh.  From what I've read it shouldnt be too hard, I extracted a bootable version of Mountain Lion to a usb drive I have and I'm in the process of figuring out what components to buy. 
So to my questions.  How hard would it be to partition my start up drive to be able to boot OSX and Windows? I would like to do basically everything on OSX and then run my games on Windows.
Also, would this build work with OSX?

So this is the second time I tried upgrading from my perfect lion partition, to mountain lion. The first time I upgraded to 10.8.2 and had the exact problems as I am having now, currently on the latest 10.8.4, which is a fresh ""upgrade"" install btw...


I've looked around and I can't seem to find a solution to my issue. I've found a few posts on google with some people describing this issue but no one seems to know how to fix it or chime in and help.


Basicly on my mountain lion drive while on the Internet or working on music in logic the GUI would freeze completely and often times a loading beach ball icon would show on the cursor. I can still move the cursor around however the time display stops at the time the GUI freezes. I could be sitting there for 5 or ten minutes the mouse still moves but the GUI still frozen. I can't so anything but but do hit the restart button on my case to force a restart.


I want to mention after installing 10.8.4 
I wen ahead and updated my video drivers from the nvidia site that supports 10.8.4 along with the cuda drivers separately inside the system pref.


I have a feeling it might be a graphic card issue but I'm told my graphics card works out of the box, and has worked perfectly in lion. 



here is my setup

Motherboard: MSI Z77A-GD65 Z77 

Processor: Intel Core i7-2700K Quad-Core Processor 3.5  - (over clocked to 4.2 ghz)

Graphics Card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 560  1 GB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0

This build is still a long way off, but I'm bored so i thought I would start planning.

*I have a PowerMac G5 I will be using as the case (any space issues?)
*I know i could go i5 and save about $100.  I probably won't use all the power of i7, but $100 for future proofing isn't a huge cost.  
*Motherboard (no idea if this is a good one)
*Memory - 2x8 or 4x4.  Any benefits either way? 
*Video Card - Thinking of going big now on the 670 and pick up another in a year or two to SLI it
*Monitor is a huge variable depending on the space the computer will live.
*Dual SSD for easier dual booting.

So, pick it apart!

* Since the computer will be mobile, it needs a battery. I looked on Mp3car.com since thats where I could find a lot of mobile computers. [This CarNetix CNX-P1900 Ver. 2.2 Dual Output 140 Watt 12V DC-DC Regulator](http://store.mp3car.com/Carnetix_CNX_P1900_DC_DC_Regulator_p/pwr-010.htm) is what I found. *$100*  
I don't know too much about electrical power so I'll leave the [Mp3car.com store power page here](http://store.mp3car.com/Power_Products_s/2.htm?searching=Y&amp;sort=5&amp;cat=2&amp;show=40&amp;page=1) if you want to give me any other suggestions.

* The last thing is [this GPS](http://www.amazon.com/BU-353-S4-Weather-proof-USB-GPS-Receiver/dp/B007KQI1NA). There is an [older model](http://www.amazon.com/GlobalSat-BU-353-USB-Navigation-Receiver/dp/B000PKX2KA/ref=pd_sim_e_2) which is $10 cheaper. The only reason I would go with the more expensive one is if it can pinpoint my position to a greater degree of accuracy. *$40*

*Total Cost: $988*

**My questions:**

1. Does this build look compatible? Does 2 SSD work in the case with the motherboard. From what I researched, I believe it would.

2. I would like to have constant internet access. What would be the most cost-effective way to do this?

3. How would you suggest I assemble the case, the battery, the gps, and the monitor together? The monitor has a base which will most-likely not work very well and the gps has a magnet on its base to attach to things.  
I'm looking to be able to carry it around in a backpack. Cooling might be an issue if that becomes the case. I'd be happy to mod a backpack but would be happier to hear your tips as well.

EDIT: 4. Pc Part picker says that the computer would take 104w which is within the 250w of the case's power supply. However, the battery only gives off 140w. The monitor is expected to need about 10w Would these be compatible?

Setting PCIRootUID=0 on the startup causes it to hang on the same screen in both instances.  Anyone encountered this before?  I can try with a normal optical drive if need be.

UPDATE: -x into safe mode kicked it into the installer.  standby...

AFTER MULTIBEAST: Used the default Multibeast config for Ivy Bridge from the guide.  Machine is now stuck on splash screen with a stopped pinwheel, but the HD activity light is going.

I'm looking for a way to re-map my Apple keyboard for use in Windows. While 95% of the keys work as advertised, there are few quirks I'd like to sort out, especially before taking on some gaming.

As it's a Hackintosh, I have a separate Windows disk rather than a Bootcamp installation. Therefore, the Mac OS didn't give the drivers, etc.

Anyone know if there is a utility, either from Apple or from third parties, where I can tell Windows 7 that I'm using an Apple keyboard? I have the install CDs for Snow Leopard, and I can download the install files for Lion or Mountain Lion.

Thanks for your help

UPDATE

I read some various articles online about several different ways to hack or otherwise work around this issue. After download a lot of crap, none of which worked, I dusted off my old Snow Leopard DVD that came with my Mac Pro, and installed Boot Camp from the Windows installers buried within the directory structure. It was the whole Boot Camp installation, so it came with extraneous crap like the drivers for the built-in iSight camera, multitouch trackpads, bluetooth adapters, etc. etc., none of which are on my Hackintosh build, but the keyboard now works, including the volume, eject, brightness, and other keys. 

After this, I used KeyTweak to change the Control and Alt keys. I had to do it twice because the first time it just ignored my request, but I cracked it in the end.

I have found two separate ways to get the 7950 to boot but don't know where to start with either.

[this post](http://www.tonymacx86.com/318-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-support-os-x-10-8-3.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tonymacx86rss+(tonymacx86)) says that: 

&gt;The AMD Radeon HD 7xxx must be the secondary graphics device in your system in order to boot using Chimera/Chameleon without a boot error and gibberish text. This is because of the larger video BIOS size. You can work around this by having a second AMD PCIe card in your system

Would I still be able to use my 7950 in Windows if I installed an older 5770 into my computer to run Mac? Or would I have to physically unplug the second video card before trying to boot into Windows?

I also saw [this](http://www.osx86.net/view/3572-xfx_7950_10.8.3_12d68_full_qe_+_hd_300_...html) and was wondering if that would make it so I didn't have to have a second video card, or is that kext file just in addition to it?

I recently installed OSX Mountain Lion on my desktop via Unibeast. Almost everything worked flawlessly out of the box - only required a Realtek audio kext beyond the standard FakeSMC patches and whatnot.

HDMI audio still remains non-functioning though. I spent close to a week sifting through dozens of forums and trying my hand at applying HD3000 AMI EFI patch to my dsdt.asl with no success. Every attempt resulted in a kernel panic. After several failures, I posted over at tonymacx86 forums and the post was unfortunately not received very well. Got a bunch of terse responses and very little real help. So now I turn to the awesome people at Reddit to see if I can resolve this issue here.

Would greatly appreciate any advice you guys can offer. I'd be happy to upload my IOReg and/or dsdt.aml to some file hosting site and post the link here as well when I get home if anybody experienced wants to take a look at it.

Wine complained about not having X11, so I had to download Quartz X11, and then had to log out and back in to get it to be my default X11.  However, my sound completely died.  I use a saffire pro firewire audio interface, and unplugging it and plugging it back in did nothing, and it was still the active interface in the sound preferences.  Also, when I tried to reboot, a bios setting got switched and my computer was having that issue where it restarts on shutdown (allow lan access or something).

Fortunately, I had a fresh clone from earlier today, so I just restored, but do any of you guys have any clue to why those three programs would give me such a hard time?  I did restore my kexts and bios settings from my backup, but that didn't fix it until I did a full clone back.

Primary uses will be work (excel, powerpoint, programming) and multimedia, but I would also like to be able to do some gaming. I've built PCs before, but have no experience building my own mac.  

Some questions:  
1) Noise; I am planning to use watercooling for both the CPU and GPU to reduce this. The piece I am looking at seems to have good reviews, does anyone have experience with it? Just a bit skeezed that it's only on eBay.  
2) I'd like to use a VESA monitor mount setup, and potentially scale up to three or four monitors in the future. Is the best way to do this via SLI (add a second card later), or should I look at a card with more outputs? If so, any suggestions?  
3) Are the two SSDs necessary / useful for the separate OSs?  
4) Will I see a notable performance boost between the i7 and i5, worth the $100?  
5) Gigabyte seems to be everyone's choice for mobo; is this a good one? Is the GA-Z77X-UP5 worth the extra $60 (Thunderbolt)?  
6) Will I be able to easily setup the non-SSD HDDs so they can be accessed from both OSs?

* Coding.
* Video editing -- nothing too intensive right now, short films mainly
* Streaming videos (netflix and the like)
* Some Windows gaming, but not much

The biggest concern I have is the graphics card.  I've got the 650 listed above, however I am considering the 660 Ti as well.  I'm just not sure I can justify the extra $175 to step up a level in the card.  I can also upgrade later.

I haven't tried sound, yet, but I think I know the right driver for that. I'm only using wireless for internet. My graphics are working fine now, but I'm not sure what optimizations I can do there to make sure that I'm getting the most out of my card. Also, my new wireless keyboard, mouse, and trackpad will be in from amazon in a couple of days, so that will probably make things a little bit easier to navigate (the mouse I am using now is junk).

If my concerns at this point are three things:
1) Sound
2) Graphics
3) Booting directly into Mountain Lion as fast as possible (skip chameleon, etc)

How should I set up multi beast?

I'm pretty happy with all of this, but I have a bit of a concern about the performance of the graphics card. I plan to dual boot in to Windows to do some minor gaming (nothing too intense). I also have a 30"" monitor that it will need to power. I have some extra room in my budget to upgrade - can anyone suggest a graphics card perhaps in the $125-$140 range that would give me a better experience?

Also, is there any considerable performance increase with the Ivy Bridge i7? ",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_161kzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/161kzb/best_midrange_graphics_card_for_new_build/,
1357062084.0,5,self.hackintosh,15s0b2,Protip:  Don't have more than one EFI partition in your Hackintosh if you expect to be able to boot Windows.  ,8,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/15s0b2/protip_dont_have_more_than_one_efi_partition_in/,"A little while back, I migrated my OS X install to a new SSD, and I decided to dual boot off of the same disk.  The entire ordeal has been a weird little misadventure, with pitfalls and problems around every corner.  I felt the need to share the tale with you fine folks so that you can avoid my pain.  This is a little bit of a story of my adventures in Hackintoshing.  

I started out my build with a slightly modified TonyMacX86 build, which regardless if you're building your first Hackintosh, or if you want to have a stable build, is a great idea.  The first install went just peachly with me using separate 74 GB Raptors to boot off of, as that's what I had laying around in my office.  I then, however, got a laptop with an SSD at work, and the performance increase was do dramatic that I had to get one for my home rig.  One far too easy Amazon Prime purchase, and I was the proud owner of a Mushkin Chronos Deluxe 256 GB. 

Because I couldn't handle having just one OS on my dual boot system having super fast drive access, I decided I was going to dual boot off of the single SSD.  I'm sure most of you are aware that in order to do this, you must have a GPT partitioned drive.  After flashing my motherboard to UEFI, formatting and installing Windows on the SSD with all of the creative partitioning required to make that happen, I then proceed to pull out my trusty external boot drive and get ready to Carbon Copy Cloner over my old OS partition - that is, until I KP because I have a DSDT when running on UEFI.

Unfortunately, I didn't have another boot disk to remove the DSDT from either of my drives, so I go about my business on my SSD with my Windows partition.  Later, thanks to someone at this subreddit,  I would be introduced to the Chameleon/Chimera flag ""DSDT=No"" which allowed me to resurrect my OS X partition and boot drive.  Hooray!  I slap the old Raptor back into the computer and go to town CCC'ing the disk to the SSD. After doing so, making sure not to clone the DSDT file, I was back in business in my OS X partition.  I choose not to boot into Windows again for a while because, dammit, I got my OS X partition back!  

Until yesterday.  The girlfriend and I decide to buy The Secret World.  I could have tried to make it run under WINE, but when I have a perfectly serviceable Windows partition, why not use it?  So I go to try to boot Windows - 0xc000000e.  All the Googles tell me that it's having trouble hitting the EFI partition where all my boot stuff is.  Sure, I say.  So I try chkdisking my Windows and EFI partition. Negative.  Try rebuilding the Windows BCD? Nope.  Windows reports that it found multiple devices that could be associated with the boot loader, and couldn't fix itself.  This should have been a red flag, but I'd never encountered anything like this before, so it didn't click.  Eventually, I say screw it, and torch my Windows install and associated partitions.  I get ready to reinstall, and I get an error - Windows can't write to the EFI partition.  

So I shut down the machine, pull out the 74 GB Raptor and as I do that realize that this is probably why the Windows Boot Loader couldn't successfully complete - it was higher in the drive chain than my SSD, therefore, the UEFI system on the motherboard chose it vs. the SSD's EFI partition.  I never needed to reinstall Windows - just pull out the old drive with the EFI partition.

This is the build I'm planning on ordering within the next few days.  I currently own a MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum Unibody) and was looking to upgrade to play games and such.  Originally I was just going to build a regular old Windows PC, but when I found out that most of the parts I had already chosen were Hackintosh compatible I figured I might as well build a computer that could run Mountain Lion and Windows 8.  

I had a couple of kind of stupid questions about compatibility. I did a quick google but didn't find anything relevant.

1.  Does it matter what RAM you use for a Hackintosh?  I wanted to use this RAM shown above but I wasn't sure if the RAM suggested on tonymacx86 was there for a reason.

2.  Does it matter if I use this 670?  This may be a stupid question but none of the suggested 670s on tonymacx86 were 4GB versions so I was wondering if there was a known issue.  I could easily just get the 2GB if it was a problem.

Other than that, does everything look good?  I appreciate you taking a look!",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_15ercw,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/15ercw/building_my_first_hackintosh_i_have_a_few/,

I want to dual boot Mac OS and Windows 7. From the reading I've done, it seems the best way to do this is to do a clean install of Snow Leopard, upgrade it to Mountain Lion, partition the drive for Windows, use Multibeast to switch between them at boot. Right?

I've got a Snow Leopard DVD to boot from. I've tried booting directly from the DVD and using iBoot, following the links on the sidebar. When I boot up, I get a kernel panic... voodoo rtclock_init panic.

I can get a Core 2 Duo and memory for free from work, so I just need a Mini-ITX board (and a PSU), and some dremel work.  So far researching on tonymacx86 I found:

* Intel DQ45EK (around $50 on ebay, etc)
* Intel DG41MJ (same)
* ZOTAC GF9300-x-x (can't really find much on these)

Would love to keep the price as low as possible!  If I can use a PicoPSU ($25 for a 120W), Hopefully can find the motherboard for less than $50.  Used is not an problem.

It says that it is Mac compatible and it is. It seemed to be the best option for 5.1 (or 7.1) audio. But when i hooked it up, the device never showed up in my system prefs or in my Audio MIDI Setup. Just the built-in input and outputs. I think all that i need is an appleHDA kext but i'm a bit of a noob and i don't know where to find one that supports USB audio devices. My mobo sound codec is ALC889 and i have been using the multibeast driver for that. But for 5.1 i'm assuming i'm going to have to download an HDA kext.

Hey guys, I finally got all my parts last night. It was mainly based on the updated NoFilmSchool tutorial. 

I'm running into a problem where, when my EVGA GTS570HD is installed onto my H77-DS3H, the mobo won't even go into the bios (black screen/monitor receives no signal). When unplugging the connections for the video card, I am able to boot into the bios.

Is it a problem with my config? I have both 8-pin power cables (from the EVGA box)going into the back. I have tried using one of my PSU's PCI-E powercords with no luck as well.

I haven't built a computer in many years so it could be a stupid thing I'm overlooking. 

Any help? Thanks!

I have a MacBook Pro from about 06 that is just about on its last leg. Damn thing can barely run Lion with the current specs, and at this point I have no intentions of updating any of the components.

I do have a question though. If I am understanding this correctly the most critical parts of these builds are:

* Motherboard
* CPU
* Graphics Card
* Network Card

Those aforementioned pieces of hardware have to be certain types in order for it to work, correct? They need to be supported by either the OS natively, or by Unibeast when installing all the drivers. So what about

* RAM
* HDD/SSD

I followed TonyMac's Ivy Bridge guide and applied the exact settings in Multibeast as in his included screenshot. The only difference is that I did NOT install the NVIDIA graphics.

A few things:
1. No audio. No output device found. I installed the .kext but didn't do any HDEF edits (I don't even know what that means)
2. RAM is reading as 1333 MHz.
3. Boot screen is low-res. A minor beef, but annoying.
4. Hard drives (both of them) appear as External.
5. Wi-Fi seems oddly flakey. It forgets my network when waking from sleep (but sleep works!) and seems slow or nonfunctional on select web pages, oddly.
6. Odd ghosting of text. For example, I can see an opaque second curser just to the right of the real one. Also text on selected menu items seems blocky, wither over- or under-antialiased. If I hook the display up via HDMI (with an adapter on the card) I get a bunch of weird pink video noise. As it is I am connected via VGA with an adapter on the card.
7. When I boot the system, I do NOT get a Chimera screen. It simply goes straight to the low-res Apple logo. When booting the logo with spinning wheel appears, then the screen goes black, and then after a few seconds my desktop is there and ready. There's no fade-in type transition.
8. The system profiler says I'm using a Mac Pro from 2008.

Gigabyte GA-H61N-USB3 (rev 1) Mini ITX Motherboard (heard this is one of the more compatible ITX boards for OSX so it was a no brainer)
Intel Core i3 (have yet to buy)
4-8GB DDR3 (have yet to buy)
60GB SSD (have yet to buy)
2TB Seagate Barracuda (plan to purchase more soon)

So I've purchased this motherboard with all good intentions, only to realise (my fault for not checking) that it only has 2 SATA ports!

As this will be a HTPC/File Server, it will be running more than 2 drives. In fact I plan to run up to 4x 2TB HDD's and an SSD for boot. Which means I'll need at least 3 more SATA ports.

Is anyone else in my situation, and found the best solution?

It's really down to buying a PCIe SATA controller with 4 internal SATA ports. This is all well and good, but I'm concerned about hardware compatibility with OSX 10.7. 

I plan to run a RAID array for possibly 2 drives (mirrored for redundancy), but RAID 5 would be nice for all 4 drives. There are Highpoint cards that claim to be Mac compatible, but I'm not too sure, and I'm not keen on shelling out $150 for one to find it doesn't work.

I'm happy to run the RAID array through the OS (Disk Utility), providing a SATA controller card works this way without issues.

Hopefully I'm not the only one in a similar situation (seeing as it's a popular board for Hackintosh systems, surely there are more people trying to run more than 2 SATA devices)

I'm really interested in making a hackintosh with my gaming comp. I have a separate external hard drive that I can use to install it on. These are my components:

* ASRock Extreme3 Gen3
* Samsung / WD Black Caviar 1 TB

Well, I completed it days ago but my xfx card turned out to be a dud. Could not boot into Lion for it's dear life. No matter what flags. So I got fed up and returned the XFX 6850 and got me a [Gigabyte GV-R687OC-1GD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125357&amp;Tpk=gigabyte%206870). While I was waiting for the card, I proceeded to install Lion with the integrated graphics in my 2500k. Install went swell but had to boot with GE=No. Card came today, popped it in and let it boot. Now Lion boots up fine with the flags that were in the chameleon boot file. QE/CI enabled, OCed to 4.5GHz. 

I was a little weary about my webcam. It actually wasn't a problem at all when I finally plugged it in it worked out of the box. My webcam is [Microsoft Lifecam Cinema](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema-720p-Webcam/dp/B002MCZJ78). I also have a [D-Link DBT-120](http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DBT-120-Wireless-Bluetooth-Adapter/dp/B00006B7DB/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334119023&amp;sr=1-1) BT adapter that also worked out of the box. 

Not a bad experience second time around for my hackintosh (first one was an acer laptop).

If not, is there a way I can install a Hackintosh OSX Lion build on the second hard drive without formatting it or losing the existing data on it?

  What I do mainly consists of Photoshop CS5.5, Premiere Pro CS5.5, and Paint Tool Sai.  I also play a handful of games, but they arent really graphics intensive (Left 4 Dead 2, Sims 3, Portal 2, Bioshock, etc.).

  I plan to get something along the lines of a Radeon 6850 or 6870 for the extent of my graphic needs; I chose Radeon because I know nothing about Nvidia cards.

  So, kind redditors, what do I need in a motherboard that works will with an SSD and what should I know before buying a GFX card?  If you have an exact model that works on a Hackintosh for sure, please feel free to mention it!

The first method I tried was iboot+multibeast. I followed the directions, and actually got through the osx installation, but I got kernel panics at every step of the process. I got them during install, and once I got through the install, I got them after running osx for a few minutes everytime I started up. And then I would get a kernel panic during the reboot. I should have kept better track of my crash pages, but I didn't. 

Then I tried the iAtkos method- I made a boot DVD, but when I try to boot from it, I get the gray screen with the apple in the middle, but with a tiny ""no"" icon over the apple.

I also tried [this method](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=256729), but when I tried to boot from it, it just showed a bunch of text of it loading files, then rebooted back into windows.

I don't even know which one I should pursue. All of a sudden I'm in over my head, and I'm not really sure where to go from here.

FInal thing- after trying the iboot method and getting all the kernel panics, I installed windows 7 just to see if everything was actually working on the computer. I have two hard drives, so do I need to wipe windows off of it before trying any of these methods?

Issues

* When I first boot into osx my mouse and keyboard doesn't seem to work. Power is going to them and I can even move the pointer around, but none of the buttons work for a few minutes. After the few minutes it just decides to work. Happens after every boot so far.

* Does not boot well into dual monitors. When I have two monitors connected (1 dvi and 1 vga with a PNY Geforce 210) the monitors just show a empty blue screen, or a faded desktop. I'm forced to restart at this point, because I can't do anything. A single monitor works alright when the second monitor is unplugged and the system restarted.

* Some of the ports on the motherboard don't work. 2 of the usb ports give power for a second to my mouse and keyboard, and after that just stops working. The on board DVI, VGA, and Displayport all don't function when in the operating system. The DVI and VGA work fine when booting up and to the loading apple screen, then nothing.

Pretty much all builds make use of Gigabyte mainboards (why does everybody love them?). Gigabyte does not support UEFI. I want UEFI because the upcoming Windows 8 will make use of UEFI to shorten the pre-boot time, hence I want to future-proof my build and have an UEFI BIOS (real EFI, not the emulated kind from Gigabyte).

Now all other mainboards I found have some kind of sleep problem (not waking up and the like).

But seeing this machine as a desktop which runs all day and gets switched off whenever I'm asleep at the helm or leave for more than a few hours, I'm currently fine with that. 



I'm running Windows 7 and Lion 10.7.1, each on their own Crucial M4 SSD. The Samsung Spinpoint 1TB drive acts as a media hub and data storage. I'm using an Hitachi 2,5"" 250GB drive from an old Macbook Pro to backup my SSDs once a week. Data and Media are backed up to Dropbox and another external 500GB WD HD, respectively. Windows is for gaming – Lion for work and everything else. I use two benq XL2410T displays, which work perfect in both operating systems. Coming from a 2010 27"" iMac, I'm totally in love with this setup. It's so fast and elegant.

I haven't built this system yet, but it is going to be the template I use when ordering very soon.

I spent the weekend getting OS X Lion running on my older HP Pavilion m9200t (E8400 Core2Duo processor and 512MB 8800GT). I figured it would be a good practice run to fail miserably on, but after a couple of days tinkering I have everything working flawlessly!

I first installed Snow Leopard with iBoot and a retail 10.6.0 disc and ran the 10.6.7 combo update. I then upgraded to 10.7 and used MultiBeast / Easybeast. After that I upgraded to Lion in the App Store. I had to use MultiBeast again to get my sound and ethernet working.

I ran Cinebench on my 8800GT before and after the Snow Leopard to Lion update... went from 22fps to 29fps in the OpenGL test! Not bad for an old card... I can run WoW in Ultra settings and a Wine port of Guild Wars at max settings.

I'm also upgrading my CS4 suite to CS5.5 to coincide with this system upgrade. Planning to switch from FCP to Premiere and make use of the CUDA drivers... Should be interesting... The Mercury Playback Engine looks awesome!

Anyway, just thought I'd throw this link out here for anyone looking to build a Hackintosh, whether for video editing or not. My version of this build skips the DVD and SSD drives, and upgrades video card to a 560 ti... comes out to around $850.

I work mainly in GUI development for iPhone apps at home, so at any given time, I have CS5, Xcode, Illustrator, Firefox, iTunes, etc open. I have all this running through my 1920x1200 24"" panel.

So, I had no reason to build a PC running windows because I *need* to have a mac around for work. It dawned on me that I could just make a hackintosh! I also found that the parts I was playing around earlier seem to be somewhat compatible for modern builds, but I wanted to run things by this subreddit to see if there is anything I should look out for. I have found various people that have gotten things working on the gigabyte Z68 chipset, but I haven't found much when it comes to compatibility with the UD4 model. I know I don't have a SSD to maximize the full potential of the Z68, but the price difference is negligible and it helps to future-proof a bit.

Also, I do want to dual boot this (using a different drive for windows/linux) so it will be a gaming machine in the other OS-verses.

I've reformatted my drive. I've also downloaded a new copy of the Windows 8 ISO and created a new USB boot drive. My Windows 8 ISO is legal, downloaded from Microsoft Dreamspark, which is associated with my university. 

I don't know if this helps, but when I plug in my USB flash drive into my hackintosh in OS X, they don't show up. They don't even show up in disk utility. My external hard drive works fine, but my the lights on my flash drive don't even light up.

Ignore the pricing as I already have all the parts and the build is up and running with W8 installed.

From what I've read so far, the video card, CPU and Motherboard are compatible with Mavericks, is that correct? Once I get DP1 on, can I upgrade through to the most recent (DP5) easily or will I have to repeat the process over and over?

For a while now, I've had great success with my DSDT-less Hackintosh rig, but the one serious gripe I have with it deals with my use of an Apple Keyboard under Windows.  

In the past, I've used keyboard remapping tools to swap my Option and Command Keys (Windows and Alt under Windows) in order to have a ""proper"" keyboard layout under Windows with my Apple wired keyboard.  However, after upgrading to Windows 8, I wasn't able to get that reliably across the entire OS.  

I'm a sysadmin, so when I'm under Windows, I'm logging into my testbed domain.  The only reason this detail is important is that I have to press Control+Alt+Delete to get to my login screen.  When I've used keyboard remappers under Windows 8, this gets fubar'd up, and I have to hit Control+Alt+Delete tens, sometimes hundreds of times to make this work.  I've remove the requirement for the keyboard combo to work around this temporarily, but I'd like to make this work all the time. 

Anyone have any good methods of swapping these keys?  I've tried keyboard remappers, using the Apple keyboard drivers, and anything that Google can produce with poor success.

I've recently decided to start developing iOS apps.

At this moment, I have one PC and do not have the money to buy a Mac. All I have is an iPhone 4s, which I doubt helps in any way but testing apps? :)

My first idea was of course - could I run OSX on a partition on my current PC, so that I can develop said apps? Then I stumbled onto ""hackintosh"", which I guess would basically be exactly that.

Now, my question is, can I run a ""Hackintosh"" on the following hardware and would I be able to develop iOS apps normally on it (or would I have complications which make that option not viable)?

**CPU:** Intel Core2Duo E8400 @ 3.00Ghz, Wolfdale

**MOBO:** Gigabyte EP43-DS3L

**GPU:** AMD Radeon HD 6870, XFX

**RAM:** 2 x 2GB Dual Channel OCZ Gold

**HDD:** Seagate Barracuda 500 GB, 7200 RPM 16MB Cache, SATA 3.0Gb/s (st3500410as)

I guess the rest of the hardware does not matter too much.

Thanks for reading! :)

And of course, any other general tips from informed people regarding developing iOS apps in this way would be much appreciated too!

My dream would to find a netbook I can boot using my Mac HD with OS X 10.4.8, but I don't know if this is an option so the ability to access the files stored on this HD are top priority. 

I'd like to buy from an online retailer that will let me return it after a few weeks of gentle use or to spend so little that it will have been a smart move regardless. I know nothing about non-Mac laptops and am eager to hear your tips about brand, model, specs, OS, retailer, software, and any other pertinent details.

**Here are my immediate needs for work:**

- Word processing (MS Word and Celtx if possible)
- Wi-fi access
- Managing the contents of my iPhone 5 (iTunes would be ideal, but I'll use whatever software lets me add/remove files)
- Basic photo management (Preview or Picasa are fine for now, GIMP would be fantastic)
- Downloading and playing audio files
- A processor that's fast enough to not drive me crazy

**Some capabilities that would be lovely but aren't necessary:**

- Streaming Netflix and playing downloaded video files
- Ability to sync calendar and notepad with my iPhone
- Downloading torrents
- Use of video and audio transcoders like HandBrake and XLD.
- Audio recording/mixing software along the lines of Garageband

What *cheap* netbooks are best suited to my needs? What are some minimum specs that I should keep in mind (processor speed, RAM, graphics card, etc)?

Because of the gigabytes of photos in iPhoto and my parents that are used to Mac OS X my first guess was the Apple website, but I quickly left it disappointed by the hardware compared to the prices. (750 euro in Holland for the i5 dual core Mac mini with 8GB ram...)

That was when my interest in a hackintosh started. I know how to build my own PC (I'm already using a Windows 7/8 desktop and an VMWware ESXi server).

My main question is how hard (or how easy) it is to actually setup and to keep it working. Can I just get the hardware from the 'Basic Compatibility Guide' and a Mac OS X 10.8 DVD and it will directly work? Also will all features be supported and can I still dual boot it with windows (8)?

Thank you for your time

The build looks good and I'm ready for my critique. My only concerns at this point are the Motherboard and Audio card; I keep coming up light on PCI slots so I went with a lower end board. It has a great rep for Hackintoshing but I'm not unwilling to upgrade it.

As for audio I'm completely open to suggestions; this box will be doubling as a game machine so the best sound would be preferable.

I'm using a Unibeast USB to boot and I'm wondering if anyone on here has ran the tool while keeping their graphics card installed and had any success/is the HDMI or DVI plugged into the board or the card?

Like I mentioned in the title, I will be dual booting this machine. I'm installing OS X first with the second hard drive disconnected (I've read this is safer for some reason?) but once this is installed I don't know where to go from there to install Win8. Do I disconnect the OS X hard drive and then throw in the install disk for Win8? Does the BIOS have to be adjusted to accommodate the second hard drive with a different OS? 

I also noticed everyone who is dual booting like I am is using an SSD for the OS and a regular hard drive for storage? Is this something I forgot to purchase? 

I think the last thing I'm a little lost on is whether or not I need to download any supplemental tools for Mountain Lion in order for everything to start working.

Most of the stuff as you can tell will be purchased at the local Microcenter. I hate that the monitors are insanely expensive, and will most likely buy them over time, but 1440p is just awesome! I also have a couple questions:

1.Will the 4GB version of the gpu be any different when it comes to compatability and/or setup?
2. I've seen a lot of builds where sleep doesn't work, will it work with these components?

-----
So this weekend I've finally decided to give this thing a go. I've had my computer for about 5 months now, and I've been using Windows 7 as my operating system but I'm longing to get back to OSX. Originally I planned to stick with Windows because it worked better for me with Adobe products. However times have changed, and now I see the benefit of using OSX (AMD OpenCL GPGPU acceleration in Premiere Pro CS6!).

Now I've been lurking for a long time on here, and to my understanding:

* We can now get the 7XXX series AMD cards to work, but it takes a little work. I'm still a little confused here, but I'm sure I can figure it out once I get OSX up and running.

* There are some sound issues with my motherboard, I can live with that though, I'll probably just pick up a cheap PCI card once I get this all running.

* I may run into issues booting without my AMD card for the first time, and using a 2560x1440 monitor since integrated graphics won't be able to run the monitor, I should however be able to use a different, smaller monitor for setup.

Now with that being said, here is what I currently have in my computer, could someone please help walk me through all this, I've read all over TonyMacX86 and this sub-reddit, but I can't seem to grasp what exactly I have to do!

The MBP I'm using has had issues almost from the beginning and now the logic board is going a bit wrong with regards the battery.  So I have decided to build my own hackintosh.

I know NOTHING about building a computer, but I'm willing to change that and undergo the frustrations of trying to get something to work, this is going to be part of the fun (hopefully).

If anyone has a good reason to stop me, then now's a great time to mention it.

If not, the first question I have is...where to get a really solid build.  I want to keep as much native OS functionality as I can.  I'm looking to build a computer that will be very fast at regular stuff (browsing and word processing, no video-editing) and can do some gaming.  Dual booting sounds good to me too.

Price range ~$1500.

So of all the builds out there, what's the golden one I want (tonymacx86?  Kakewalk? Etc.?)

Hi reddit. Just wondering if you guys could look over this build? If there's any way to make it cheaper, that'd be great, but mainly I just want to be aware of any 1st time builder mistakes.

1. I need a case, the one on tonymacs build is too much for me. Looking for a cheap $30-$80 case.

2. Do I need a CPU cooler...?
 
3. Is there a good cheaper wireless network adapter?

4. Is the power supply enough watts?

5. Do I need an optical drive for anything?

I'll be using it for mostly work (dont need a strong computer for work) and gaming (minor games that my 4 year old iMac can play). I am looking to save money if possible.

Okay so I'm having problems with dual booting into Windows 8. I'm very new to all of this so I'll do my best at explaining my problem. 

The OSX install went smoothly, but I've been trying all night to get Windows working. When I went to install it I was getting an error that said:

 ""*Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks.*""

So I unplugged every other drive and just left the 1TB drive I wanted to install Windows on, and the installer USB. That worked fine and I was able to install windows. 
Now when I plug all the other drives back in and I try to boot into windows with the bootloader, I just get this: http://imgur.com/iPqP65Q

So originally I had Chimera, and I did the iMessage fix which involves installing a bootloader (chameleon.) Awhile back I decided to switch back to Chimera, and it installed fine so I rebooted. Now it stops at a black screen that has 2 lines of text then stops. Something about reading Kernal? (I'll take a picture later).

TL;DR went from chimera --&gt; chameleon --&gt; chimera. Does not boot any further than 2 lines of text.

Is there anything I can do to fix this without losing anything or am I SOL?",,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,True,t3_1brh5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1brh5e/idiotic_mistake_installed_chimera_on_chameleon/,
