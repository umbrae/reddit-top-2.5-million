What's yours?,115,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1c8ywa/my_thoughts_on_the_best_hour_of_television_whats/,"That right there was beyond words. I've never shed tears over a show before or ever enjoyed a show/movie as I did tonight. Ima do my best to put why this was perfect to me. Maybe a little long but this is well deserving.

•The Battle - Was perfect. With all hope lost and sorely out numbered I feared that this above all would be interesting but mostly a massacre. Yet Steven Deknight showed us wrong. Spartacus' Mind of war shone through and one moment to the next was a rush and even had me believing they may win until the inevitable falls.

 •Everyone of our favorite characters were giving justice. Whether by their deaths or slipping away, I got much more than I could've imagined out of this finish.

 • Lugo went out in Flames, killing Romans and Spilling German.

 • Saxa went out like the bad chick she is. She also found herself in Gannicus arms for the last time.

 • Nevia who I liked personally, fought to the death with pride and got a glorious death at the hands of Cesar.

 • Gannicus getting crucified broke me. But the way they portrayed his death was glorious, he died a better man than he ever was and the leader he never thought hed be. And through his eyes the arena was his final sight regardless of his true place. He died as he stood A God of the Arena.

 •Everything they did with Spartacus and the flashbacks and Moments of season 1 and Sura was amazing. I had chills when I saw Agrons shield. We all wondered how Spartacus body was never found and we found out, again props to SDK for imagination writing that. And Liam was amazing and his end was BreathTaking. When the rains came it gave me chills, Im still reeling from that masterpiece. I never thought knowing how it all ends could be so amazing to watch as it played through. Epic/Legendary are not good enough words.

 • I Loved how they didn't really stray from history, really Pompey catches slaves escaping to the north, Crassus gets glory stolen, We see a glimpse of the first Triumvirate forming, Spartacus body never found, who's to say that this may not have been what really happened? That a small band of rebels took a different route and wasn't never found out?..

 • in conclusion. My favorite show past four years or so Gave me more than I could ask for, and ending that I couldn't think of if I wanted to. Aside from the deaths of our beloved rebels, that amazing Battle scene Blew my mind. All in all, finally a episode out did ""kill them all"" in my opinion.. The credits paid Tribute to all the cast..

• I Am Spartacus from Andy Whitfield at the very end was the cherry on top of the best hour of television I've witnessed. RIP Andy

 •RIP Spartacus

This show started out very silly and obnoxious, like something my friends and I would have written in eighth grade, the week after we saw 300 in theaters. But after about two episodes, I started to see that this was going to be something special. 
As the story progressed, it went from simple gratuitous ""slow-mo killing"", and evolved into a very human story of love, loss, betrayal, exile, and revenge. 

We're shown a key piece of Roman history through the ""Assassin's Creed lens"". The great slave rebellion, the battle of Mount Vesuvius, and all the political maneuverings made in-between by the senators, as the threat of a people's revolution becomes more and more real.
And while a lot of us history buffs might already know how the story of Spartacus ultimately ""ends"", it's still very inspiring to see.

One man, taken captive and sold into slavery to die, who rises high above all his contemporaries in the history books, to become a legend immortalized and remembered for thousands of years. 

One man, a peasant from Thrace... who in one glorious moment, shook the entire Roman Empire with the force of one universal idea. Freedom.

Please comment with any cool facts about the show you know! Also if any of these are incorrect please let me know and I'll fix them.

Spartacus Trivia:

* The races of some characters have been altered for the sake of the show. Oenomaus was historically a Gaul (Numidian on the show), and Castus was a Roman (Numidian on the show). 

* Of the confirmed homosexual fighter characters, Agron is the only one who does not use a polearm. Barca, Auctus, Nasir, and Castus fight with spears. Gneus fights with a Trident. 

* All of the gladiators from the House of Batiatus keep their standard equipment for most battles, except for Crixus. Spartacus and Gannicus mostly use two swords, Agron keeps a sword and shield. Crixus, however, often wields only a single sword with no shield.

* Crixus' title of ""The Undefeated Gaul"" is a play on words regarding the famous sculpture *The Dying Gaul*

* Crixus and Naevia are the longest lasting characters on the show, being active for its entire run so far. If either character lives until the final episode of ""War of the Damned"", they will have been present for the entire series. 

* Due to an actress change for the character Naevia, Manu Bennet as Crixus is the longest lasting actor on the show. 

* Peter Mensa (Oenomaus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) have the exact same lifespan in the show. Both were present for all of ""Gods of the Arena"", all of ""Blood and Sand"", and die at the end of the final episode of Vengeance. 

* Spartacus and Crixus both lose a child in a situation involving Lucretia. 

* Despite killing the most characters on the show, Spartacus has never killed a female. He did, however, make two attempts to kill Illythia and considered killing Laeta.

* Historically Crixus was stated to have curly blonde hair, similar to Varro in appearance. 

* Actor Andy Whitfield (Spartacus in Blood and Sand) had a tattoo on his forearm in the exact spot of his slave brand. 

* Multiple characters on the show have had ""stays of execution"", prolonging their lifespan because the cast got along with the actor or loved the character so much. Confirmed ones are Varro, Lucretia, Lugo, and Donar.

* Despite being labeled a failure, Glaber actually defeats Spartacus in multiple engagements and follows sound military strategy. He is defeated by a ploy nobody would have expected.

* All of Spartacus' depicted victories over Praetor's in the show are a result of a bold, and often ridiculous strategy. Whenever Spartacus attempts to hold to sound military strategy (Keeping the high ground against Glaber, refusing any engagement with Crassus from inside Sinuesa) he is/would be defeated.

* Despite attempting to wait the rebels out on top of Vesuvius being labeled a ""foolish move"" by Glaber, Spartacus himself attempts the same tactic against Crassus. Both are met with swift defeat.

* Varinius only engages Spartacus once, and is swiftly defeated and killed. This leads to a larger battle involving Glaber. Historically this is reversed.

* Crixus, Varro, and Agron all have sea-animals on their shields while serving as gladiators in the House of Batiatus. They have an octopus, eel, and crab, respectively. 

* Gannicus and Theokoles are the only gladiators with tattoos. 

* Siaosi Fonua (Hamilcar in ""Blood and Sand"") is killed in season 1 by a Roman guard. He appears again in ""War of the Damned"" as a Cilician pirate who is quickly dispatched by Gannicus.

* Caesar is one of the few Romans in the show to hold to some idea of justice. While all the main antagonists have attempted something immoral (Batiatus uses murder and blackmail, Glaber murders innocents, Varinius attempts to take Glaber's wife, Crassus sells Laeta to the Cilicians as a slave), Caesar is shown to be greatly enraged by acts of cruelty towards his people. He weeps at the site of Fabia asking him to take her life. He is incredibly kind towards Laeta and is visibly furious as Crassus sells her later in the episode. He also seems to show a level of respect for slaves who have proven themselves (although not as much admiration as Crassus holds for Spartacus), as he compliments Donar after their battle.

* Spartacus and Gneus are the only gladiators who have been seen switching styles. Spartacus changed from a Thraex to a Dimachaeri, and Gneus changes from a Murmillo to a Retiarius. Varro is occasionally seen practicing as a Hoplomachus, but all of his arena battles have him fighting as a Murmillo. 

* The most highly skilled gladiators on the show are often depicted as Dimachaeri-class, or at least dual-wield weapons, in at least one scene. Spartacus, Gannicus, Oenomaus, Theokoles, and the Egyptian all do this.

* Gannicus is likely the most skilled warrior in unarmed combat. In fact, he wins every battle that involves him fighting without a weapon. 

* Theokoles is an albino. This accounting for his pale skin, red eyes, and sensitivity to light.

* The only gladiators to ever stand against Theokoles and survive all come from the House of Batiatus, Spartacus, Oenomaus, and Crixus. 

* Josef Brown (Auctus) is a professional dancer as well as actor, which leads to Auctus having exceptional grace and agility in the arena.

* Marcus Crassus is mentioned multiple times in the series before his appearance. He is mentioned more than once in Blood and Sand as cousin to Licinia, as well as offering a large reward to any who have information of her after her disappearance. He is mentioned again in Season 2 when Varinius makes a joke about him at a party.

* Caesar has intense distaste towards the Cilicians on the show. While this could be attributed to him being a proud Roman citizen who hates pirates, this is likely a reference towards his historical capture at the hands of Cilician pirates. After escaping, Caesar amassed ships and troops and crucifies all of the pirates who captured him. 

* Caesar attacks Spartacus with a knife to the back during a surprise attack by his allies. This mirrors Caesar's death during the famous ""Ides of March""

* Nemetes' line ""The die has been cast"", spoken to Caesar before he is killed, is a reference to Caesar's own words before he began the battle with Pompey to assume leadership of Rome. 

* Though sometimes it is hard to tell, every scene was filmed indoors despite the majority of them taking place outside. Historically these events would have taken place outdoors. 

* In ""Vengeance"", the skill of the gladiator army seemed to greatly eclipse that of a Roman soldier. In ""War of the Damned"" that has changed to have the standard gladiator be roughly equivalent to a Roman, while the major character gladiators are significantly stronger than even groups of Roman soldiers. Even Caesar, arguably the most talented Roman in combat, was bested by Gannicus with little difficulty (twice) and would have been bested by Donar if not for the latter's wounds. 

* Despite being depicted as a military genius on the show, historically the battle against Spartacus is Crassus' only major military victory. 

* Spartacus has a habit of adopting strategies his opponents have used on him. He attempts to starve Crassus out by forcing his soldiers to endure harsh conditions, as Glaber did to him. He also released the Roman prisoners to purposely deliver a manipulating message to Crassus, something Crassus himself did to Spartacus earlier. 

* Marcus Crassus never had a son named Tiberius, his two children were named Marcus and Publius. Considering that one of his two sons on the show is named Publius, it is likely that Tiberius represents Marcus and was renamed to avoid confusion.

* Heraclio refers to Spartacus as ""King Spartacus"", and although unrelated this is likely a nod to the audience in regards to how he received his name from Batiatus. ""Legend tells of a Thracian king of old, Spartacus he was called...""

* Although Senator Albinius blames Glaber for bringing Spartacus to Roman soil, Albinius is the one who granted Spartacus life during his execution. 

* The kiss between Saxa (Ellen Hollman) and Mira (Katrina Law) after their organized match during Spartacus' team building exercises was not scripted. Hollman felt it was something her character would do, and they kept it in the final cut, making the look of surprise on Mira's face genuine.

Instead he was going to give Spartacus an honorable death and end his life. He knew Spartacus got the best of him and did not taunt him like Ceasar did Gannicus after being embarrassed so many times.

I would like to throw one more thing out there this week. What do you guys think of trying to get the attention of Starz to recognize this subreddit? I feel its safe to say this is the main subreddit for the Starz rendition of Spartacus, and I know we don't have a *ton* of viewers now, but we have steadily been climbing and I feel we are very active. If anything, just having Starz, or a member of the cast, post a link the this subreddit we could see our subscribers soar. So really, this is me asking you all to spread this subreddit. If anyone has connections to any of the cast or crew it would be greatly appreciated, but that is definitely a long shot. Anyways, just me rambling again. I just love to see the community grow. I joined when there was under 100 people I believe and as I write this now we have 802. A good climb.

*  Oenomaus finally let go od the House of Batiatus (Entirely at least by what he said to Crixus)
*  The relationship between Agron and the body slave (his name escapes me) is shown.
*  The Arena at Capua is burnt to the ground

It festered, reeling at the thought of Spartacus, the man, the depiction, the show, and its abundant glories. I could not have predicted my experiences with Spartacus beginning the journey (without provocation or recommendation, mind you) 4 years back, but on too many levels to count, the voyage has been revelatory. *I shall hereby, attempt to articulate the many values that Starz’ Spartacus has revealed to me, and may reveal to others.*

---

&gt;**A Grueling Beginning**

Any viewer will likely agree in the distastefulness, clumsiness, and missteps of the premier entry to the series. Episode 1, the Red Serpent, is the much-needed de-virginizing to Spartacus’ beginning, yet shown with tactlessness and paired with an ear of corn. It’s straight cheddar, and it *knows* it. The effects, the dialogue, the acting, and the motivations are wafer-thin for a series. What the audience has to cherish is camp, and it arrives in spades. We also see the potential of its core values that are further expanded upon.

 
We see the show is willing to accept criticism of vulgar content, and relishes in it. We see ample nudity unbefitting for even an R-rating, we see not-even-remotely realistic blood and gore effects, and wade through lines of painful dialogue delivered through gritted teeth. Only the label of *guilty pleasure* can stand here, *with the label of “class” unraveling upon entering the house of Batiatus*. 


If one is not deterred from the first episode, know that the second proves more enticing, yet still with many faults. The dialogue begins to form shape, crafting its own linguistic style that is both ingenious in its vulgarity as in its quotability and appeal to metaphor. The SFX do not improve until much later, but the themes of combat, brotherhood, and noble ideals begin to appear. A viewer here is still unsure of the show’s prowess. 


By Episode 4, a spectator should know the nature of the show, with its uncompromising vision to Rome, immersion, and the life of a Lanister. The first season’s story arc takes time to blossum, but that time is well rewarded. *Spartacus himself is a naïve, foolish, and stubborn man before episode 7. Every action twists arm of viewer and forces anger to bud. Without hesitation, Spartacus is quite possibly the most bull-headed protagonist in any show up until around episode 8 or so. 

**This of course, is one of the most rewarding aspects of the entire arc of the show. Spartacus yet manages to remove head from ass and listens to the words of Jupiter himself. When he finally accepts the name of Spartacus, as Andy so vehemently portrays in the Arena, the audience does as well**.


The show, quite literally, gets better in every aspect during its tenure. SFX, nudity, content, violence, plot, character manipulation, motivation of action, dialogue, props, set pieces, cinematography, envelope-pushing… all the way through the bitter end, the show matures before our eyes. If a fan pays tribute and honors the show, the show returns glory ten-fold. 

---

&gt;**Immersion, understanding Rome, history, and an uncompromising vision**


History books, while flawed in their own ways, are exceptional *semantic* representations of our world. We can understand, and know the course of events as if blessed by the Gods themselves. Yet no matter how many times we can *read* about the horrors of war, the atrocities of slavery, or the true representation of objectifying people, nothing compares to the *visual splendor and realism of Spartacus.* It is both highly stylized and yet *real*ized. It fills in gaps in understanding the way no history book can do. While it takes some liberties with historical accounts, it’s also accurate in its depiction of major events, leaving skilled writers to fill the gaps with creativity and fiction – all grounded in believability as the show progresses. 


**No other show, or medium for that matter, showcases slavery in such a way**. The caste system of Rome has never before breathed in such a way, with 40+ hours of an immersive, fully-fledged world created for us, the fans/audience. The moment you see Batiatus engaging in complex conversation with Lucretius, his wife, whilst being pleasured by a slave in a manner too casual to understand, while topless slaves stand idly by as props, *not people*, is the moment you begin to sense and acknowledge the social shackles of servitude within Rome. 


*Everyone in the show answers to someone of a higher status*, and everyone is an object of another’s will. The dialogue is centered around these ideals, as are the actions, and the motivations. The show pulls no punches in its depictions of such things, and in fact revels in the vulgarity of it. Protagonists bare full-frontals, main characters are torn apart before our eyes, and the words “Jupiter’s Cock” bellow from many a mouth. **What we’re left with is a sense of awe and directness, refreshing in its portrayal, and ever pleasing to the primal senses.** 



Not only are we capable of teleporting to ancient Rome to view such atrocities, our head is held fixed upon the sights. Our minds forced upon considerations of tolerance, oppression, status, and the world we live in presently; the show is for all intents and purposes *uncompromising and authentic*.  What at first rings of “guilty pleasure” in its nudity, vulgarity, and violence becomes a staple of authenticity. The character we grow to love and cherish become fully realized and personal in acts of intimate love, or acts of intimate death.  

---

&gt;**Interlacing the motif; succeeding as a series**


From my own personal philosophy, I contest movies can rarely compare in emotional investment and trauma to that of a show. 40 hours of living with a character clearly trumps the minute, fragmented investment of a feature length film.  In Spartacus, every character, every villain, every action is seeping with tense, well-crafted end goals. 


*Each demise of hero a true scar upon psyche, and each destruction of villain a victory felt within heart;* I cannot recall a singular episode where I failed to feel a catharsis, often experiencing the intimate pleasures on screen vicariously more viscerally than any other medium yet held dear. *From the heart-pounding glory of the arena came actual cheers and clenched fists, to the tear-stricken eyes of a lost friend felt as if true Brother had fallen, to the relishing of conniving ploy used to gain political advantage, this show is a textbook when it comes to infusing emotion in a viewer*. To be blunt, the writing and dialogue are *excellent beyond comprehension* - a notion unbelieved when juxtaposed to the clunkiness of the first 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1 (there are 3.5 seasons, .5 belonging to a well-received prequel showcasing Gannicus, *my personal favorite character anywhere*).

One of the most impressive and as-of-yet unconventional depictions of homosexuality is also present throughout. In the presence of large hulking men, the machismo never waivers and is simultaneously juxtaposed with impassioned scenes of men loving one another. They are not abundant, with usually one or two couples per season, but I've not laid eyes upon a show that depicts a homosexual relationship as something so casual yet non-stereotypically masculine and in line with the nature of the times. It never elevates or segregates these relationships, but showcases equal footing. Such elements are worthy of respect. 


We see true character and developmental arcs in this series in a way that is incomparable to other envisionings. From the Ludas of Batiatus in its downfall, to its prequel-granted rising, to the fleeing from the republic, to the battles on the fields of the damned, the protagonists, antagonists, and side-plots develop the story and immersion in magnificent spectacle. With every minor victory, the filming places catharsis on a pedestal, and pretty much makes the viewer raise arm to the heavens in pure ecstasy (or at least was mine and friends’ reaction, on a weekly scale).

&gt;**Overcoming difficulties; the Loss of a Star**


Perhaps this is one causal reason why Fans of the show are so honored by it: the protagonist of Season 1, Andy Whitfield, does not come back for Season 2. His bout with cancer unfortunately took his life before continuing with the filming of another season. Such delay and drama would destroy most shows, yet somehow, his replacement, Liam, managed not only to stay afloat atop such lofty expectations, but exceled in soaring above them. 



To be honest, I suspected the show was destined for failure when Andy died. Not only was it a blow fictionally to the character, but to life itself and my unrecognized love of the actor. It led me to watching behind the scenes footage, loving the show in a whole new light. For a show that highlights the glory of final decision, in death, the passing of Andy intertwined the show with his glory. 
It’s quite difficult to watch a show and sequester personal beliefs in hopes of positioning oneself into the structure of intolerance. To fulfill role and imagine oneself in the shoes of Batiatus, Glabur, Ashur, or Crassus, is a feat of philosophical difficulty. To look upon the people on screen as objects, to view the *human beings* as nothing more than tools is a complete necessity in understanding the motivations of all involved. What appears on a surface level as softcore porn and gratuitous violence is the most immersive lesson on the subjects of Brotherhood, slavery, justifying action, and status no history book could really teach. 



*To add to its luster by being highly polished, complex, and cinematographic only stands to elevate Spartacus’ position in the annuls of film and media.*  



**TL;DR**


*Spartacus is a triumph on various levels. A surface level joy with ample nudity and savage violence, it satisfy primal needs for lust and blood and never waivers in showcasing joyful pleasures on screen, while the ears rejoice in complex dialogue begging to be repeated. Visuals and audio satiate while the mind finds comfort and challenge in delving deeper into analytical thought of the ideologies, maxims, and motivations of developing characters, based on such an anarchistic time-period. Devotees are rewarded with ever-improving direction and narrative, as the body and heart itself of every viewer is elevated ferociously in the regaling of such a tale. To endure full-lengths’ journey is to endure voluptuous ranges of emotion, horrible and glorious alike. I implore anyone with mature mind and desire to see spirits soar partake in magnificent media: For Spartacus!*

The self post simply iterates rules and etiquette, see here: [r/thewalkingdead discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/qhuur/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s02e11_judge/). My question to you, and as well to the mods of this subreddit is, would you like to see this instead of me spilling my thoughts as well? Reserve the opening post for rules and allow discussion to follow in the comments? Well, debate it this week. For now I will do a short rant, I can't help myself.
_________________________________________________________

So, on to business! This week, ""Sacramentum"" was a good episode, for rebels and Romans alike. The only downside was the capture of Ilithyia. I do not see either side benefiting from this as I feel at this point Glaber does not care for her health, only his heir's and Spartacus would rip her to shreds, which I do not see Gannicus or Oenomaus allowing anytime soon. Do you think Gannicus will bring her to the rebels? I can assume now he will join the rebels, he has to, but do you think he will bring Ilithyia to Spartacus? No good can come of that, only chaos, for both sides. 

The only other major point I wish to bring up is Glaber laying with Seppia. What do you make of this? I for one hate the bitch. Forgive my bluntness but she connives just as much as Lucretia and Iliythia yet she is half their age. I do not like this new man Glaber has become. He was a man of honor only seeking out defectors and rebellious slaves (not saying slavery is right only justifying current actions!).  He truly has become corrupt, but then again, maybe that is expected of a Praetor? Hmm. 

Anyways, to end my thoughts, I just want to bring up the mess with Agron and the slaves he brought back. Do you think he tried to circumvent Spartacus's ruling or was it just an honest mistake absent thought and just wanting to avoid more Gauls?

Here's my $0.02 on how it's gonna go down.  Post yours!

NOT GOING ANYWHERE

Spartacus: protected by history

Crixus: protected by history

Naevia: killing her off after spending half the season looking for her is too nihilistic even for DeKnight.  Looks like she's an archer in battle even with all that sword training, so less likely she's in harm's way.

Lucretia: if the Blood &amp; Sand finale couldn't kill her not much can

Illythia: hard to see who would have motive if Sparty wouldn't do it.  Was Lucretia in on killing Seppia?  It seemed like she actually wanted Glaber killed...

Saxa: she seems to be getting built up to be a semi-major character, unlikely she'd die having gotten so little development

Nagron:  I think they're safe given their status as the show's Official Gay Couple Who Does Not Have Sex On Camera Or Show Their Penises.  Agron's also too indispensable given his role with the Germans.

COULD BE IN TROUBLE

Mira: On the one hand, the breakup with Sparty seems opportunely timed for her to die and Sparty to get all emo about not having loved her while he had the chance.  On the other, she's basically the top female warrior and archer, and might be too indispensable to the group.  I certainly would hate to see her go.

Gannicus:  Doesn't seem likely given the show's depiction that nobody can even touch this guy when it comes to fighting, but I could see something happening where he sacrifices himself for the good of the group (maybe to kill the Egyptian) and redeem himself in Oenomaus' eyes.  I would NOT be in favor of this, show.  Give us a little more time of all the main good guys being united and alive.

Oenomaus:  On the one hand, he's taken a shitload of abuse and should be dead twice over by now.  On the other hand, wounds seem to heal pretty well in the Spartacus universe, and if they were going to have him die I think they'd have done it in the fight with the Egyptian.  I don't see how he could still be fighting physically  in Ep.10, so I guess if he died he'd have to die of his wounds.  Bottom line, I think he's safe, because if they gave us the detail of him losing an eye but being more or less able to walk away, they are going to have to give us at least a few episodes of Oenomaus alive and well but with a badass eye patch.

Ashur:  I could see him living to ensure some continuity with the villains, since Glaber will likely be gone.  But then, he needs killing so badly, and Lucretia is due for a coup of some sort...  I'd like to see him weasel away from the battlefield only to come home and get pwned by ""loving wife...""

SAY YOUR GOODBYES

Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber: I think we all know this is coming

Donar: they seemed to show him fighting a lot in Ep 9, and he doesn't have too many deep plot ties to other characters...  we should expect at least one named gladiator has to die, and he's a strong candidate

Salvus: Glaber's tribune who gets his ass kicked by Ashur

The Egyptian: the question is who does the job, and does he kill any of our favorite gladiators before he goes down?

Nemetes:  We should expect at least one named German to die in the fighting, and given that Saxa is likely sticking around and Lugo looks like he was in the Egyptian's graduating class at the Theokoles School Of Being Built Like a Fucking Dump Truck, Nemetes looks like the dead man out.  Nemetes is also kind of a whiny bitch while Lugo is hilarious.

I think we saw some huge movements for the plot tonight. It was odd, there wasn't nearly as much sex in this episode. Do you think they held back slightly seeing as Lucretia got raped? They could have thought it a touchy thing to have her raped and then show some harlot bent over immediately after. Regardless, very enjoyable.

So, on to matters. Most important detail in this episode? I would give that to Ashur's new role. Absolutely. Commanding a mercenary force now? That is huge! I was looking around at pictures on the Facebook page for Spartacus and a picture was shown of the Egyptian fighting as we saw at the end in Sepius's villa. It was thrown out over there that people thought this to be Castus. For those of you who don't know, Castus, historically, was a general in Spartacus's army. What a twist that would be. A slave recruited by Ashur becoming a major general for Spartacus? I hope this comes to fruition. What do you all think? 

Another high point in this episode was in the same scene: Sepius's demise. How do you all feel of this? I for one am so glad to see his life forever taken. He was a little shit. Always speaking absent thought. Holding Virinious's cock in mouth. He deserved his fate, but I did not expect Glaber to go to such extremes. I feel it betrays his character. The only killing before this that he contributed in that was of Roman blood was his father-in-law and that was more of the moment than planned vengeance. I feel that moment, killing his father-in-law, was a defining moment for him. I think Glaber changed. I do not believe we will see him so timid ever again. Ilithyia has finally pushed him over the edge. He has been set on path. Thoughts forward on to darker days. Blood soaked days. I for one love it! But again, I feel he has largely changed since the beginning, do you agree?

This episode had many defining moments, and I wish to discuss them all but I don't want this to be a paper for you all to read. I only wish to spur thought. To open forum. On that note, I leave you with one more thought, Naevia and Crixus, oh she fucked in the head all right. To deny Crixus his touch? Ouch.

Sorry, sorry, one more thing. Mira. Suddenly becoming a master bowman to rival Diana herself? This is too much for me. No way someone could pick that up so quick with such proficiency. That is the only gripe I had this week.

He knows what he is doing without a doubt, and he was fighting long before any other main character. After Gannicus, I would say Spartacus and Crixus are pretty evenly matched skill wise. Crixus has more experience in the arena, as he was the champion before Spartacus was even captured. But as the show progressed, Spartacus definitely showed very great potential. I would say they are evenly skilled. 

Further down the skill tree, Agron is definitely the weakest link of the ""leader-type characters."" Agron was only brought to the Ludus a short time before the slaves took over and began their uprising. He got training, but based on the amount of time, he did not get nearly enough arena time, and almost every time he did, he was at a disadvantage. He just cannot compete with Spartacus, Crixus, and Gannicus in skill, nor could he ever hope to. 

Furthermore, I find it bullshit that Naevia magically is a master swordsman, capable of killing hundreds of soldiers all of a sudden. She should not stand a chance to even the lowliest of soldiers. That really irritates me to no end.

Lastly, I don't care how it goes down in the show, or how it appears, Caesar would never be able to defeat Spartacus, Crixus, or Gannicus. They are hardened gladiators who have laid waste to countless men. If Caesar kills any of those 3, I'm calling complete bullshit.

Just so no one gets angry, **I DO EXPECT SPOILERS TO SURFACE HERE**. I hope to do this after every episode more to keep this subreddit alive than anything, but also to sate my need for everything Spartacus.


So, let the words part from lips. I loved it! I feel this is the *true* first episode of this season. What do I mean by that? Well, I believe the first (in this case the first two) episodes of the first season and the prequel were chalked full of gratuitous sex and violence to pull people in. After this initial phase is when you began to see the true intrigue with the betrayal and story progression. The biggest reason I believe this episode to be the case was because of the reveal of Ashur's role in Lucretia's survival alongside the appearance of Naevia (and subsequent capture of Crixus?!). Going right along with that I am curious as to hear what you all think will happen to/with Crixus? Its obvious from the preview of next week's episode that he has been captured and not killed (yet?), but what role do you think he will play in Glaber's game? 

One more question to end my rant and I believe this question won't be answered until the end of the season, but... do you believe that Lucretia will come to kill Ilithyia? I have come to think that Lucretia's original *crazy* behavior when discovered by Ilithyia and Glaber was a ploy. Don't get me wrong, I am sure she was slightly gone, but I believe she is playing Ilithyia to try and win favor again to help aid in her coming vengeance, hence the season's name! Do not think that the term vengeance only applies to Spartacus and Crixus. I believe we will see multiple people get their vengeance (or better - revenge) this season. Think, Gannicus v. Oenomaus, Lucretia v. Ilithyia, Ashur v. Everybody(I am thinking this will be Crixus specifically), and of course Spartacus v. Glaber. As well, I believe that a rivalry will form between Agron and the Syrian Tiberius. I believe this is not his real name and I cannot remember if this is still what he goes by. I just remember for sure it was his name as a slave, but I remember a scene where he told Spartacus (or was it Crixus?) what his brother called him.

Any ways, sorry for the rant, just trying to spur discussion that doesn't center around the song ""My cock rages on!""

EDIT: One more thing, how do you guys spell Nivea? I have seen it spelled numerous ways, but on Imdb it is spelled Naveia. Naevia is how it spelled on Starz website though.

One of the most complicated characters we've seen:

1. He forgives Kore and Caesar immediately when he realizes what a dick Tiberius was. He's not so arrogant to deny his faults when he sees them. 

2. His Talk with Spartacus at the Mountaintop was one of the best this show's ever seen. By this time, he's a deeply wounded man, not in this for glory or reputation; all he wants is to END this war in Victory, doesn't even care about personally killing Spartacus or getting revenge. 

3. He knows he's been beaten in the final battle, but ultimately it doesn't matter to him; his men fatally wounded spartacus and his nightmare (this entire rebellion is over).

4. Finally, what shocked me was how he crucified Kore (I didn't think Kore would get off scott-free, but CRUCIFIXION?) with no qualms whatsoever. You can see it in his eyes; she's forever a reminder of this traumatic period, and he's willing to part ways if it means putting the past behind him. 

5. FInally, him deferring to Pompey as an investment for future power (beginning the 1st Triumvirate). That's probably the only thing he had left after all this, and he simply brushes it off, knowing that being humiliated in the Senate (for ""failing"" to kill Spartacus), is just a temporary setback to true power.


Any thoughts from you all?

Honestly, the guy is one who knows his priorities. I think all he desires is to elevate the Name of Crassus and gain power. He has his tough moments, but the way he seamlessly severs ties and makes incredibly tough decisions that serve a greater purpose. I forever love spartacus, but I forever respect this man.

I begin to love the show, but when I first start respecting it as a piece of valuable television drama, is when they depict their first real Homosexual romance. Up to that point, I think about how the show is well acted and eggreciously entertaining, but it's still somewhat exploitational. It never backs down from being extreme, but that extremeness is part of the day-in-day-out lifestyles of what slaves endured.

We are shown sex scenes of both types as much as regular heterosexual sex scenes....and I love it.

No need to black out details here. Its a discussion, its expected.

I don't have near as much to say about this episode compared to the last, but I guess the biggest thing is the situation with Ilithyia. I am disgusted by her maneuvering to sway Verinious (spelling?), and when I found that Lucretia laid with her father to help sway his position on the dissolution of her marriage, again, disgusted! It is hard to predict though what Lucretia's actions are actually driven towards though. I have found it very difficult to read her this season thus far. I believe that she has a huge underlying respect for Glaber and, of course, absolutely hates Ilithyia. With this I am thinking she will help sway the dissolution of their marriage to only later give support to Glaber for revenge possibly? What do you think?

My other major question is your thoughts on the rescue of Naevia. Do you think it was worth it? I know not the numbers they went with to the mines, but it was damn well higher than four, the number  they had when they met back up with Agron. Do you believe the trip for Naevia was worth it? Do you think they will go back to the mines, if not in this season, in a future one, to recruit, and free, the slaves there?

In the last fight I expected Spartacus and Crixus to destroy Ashur's minions, but they were barely able to take out a few of them (even with ranged support!).

1. Theokeles - No one was able to beat him 1v1.  Even Oenomaus couldn't take him down.  Won a 100v1 battle.

2. Oenomaus - Been a gladiator since he was a kid.  Trained and beat Spartacus and Crixus 1v2.  Held out against Gannicus with a dull sword, while wearing handcuffs.

3.  Spartacus - Bringer of Rain.  Killed Theokoles (with help).  Beat 7 Roman soldiers with a wooden sword.  Can jump 30 feet off of a shield.  Frequently wins fights with multiple opponents.  

4.  Gannicus - Only slave to be granted freedom in the arena.  Though he doesn't take anything seriously, he is always 100% when it comes time to fight.  Possibly can beat Spartacus 1v1, we shall find out in episode 6.

5.  Crixus - The undefeated Gaul.  Champion of Capua for many years.   Though injured by Thekoles, he assisted in Sparty's victory.  Killed Auctus in his first gladiator match, though not even a true gladiator.  Recovered from near death to square off against Spartacus once again.  Fought soldiers unarmed in the mines.

6. Barca:  The beast of Carthage.  Killed his own father in the arena.  Personal bodyguard to Batiatus.  Experienced in arena combat as well as unarmed brawling.  Will kill a kid, but maybe feel bad about it.

7. Dagan - The big, one-eyed Syrian.  Slaughters opponents and saves his buddy, who later betrays his ass AND eye.  Fights with one eye, still manages to do well, until betrayed one final time.

8. Gnaeus - The crazed goat.  Master of the Retarius style of net and trident.  Actually manages to make this look badass in GOTA.  Easily enraged.

9.  Varro - Didn't have a lot of time to learn the ropes, but won some matches.  Gave Spartacus a decent fight before horrible things happened.

10.  Ashur - By far the worst fighter in the house of Batiatus.  A snake, he betrays and murders those closest to him.  He did manage to kill a couple guys in the finale of GOTA before getting Crixused.

We see from episode 1 that Crassus had meant to use Caeser for this very purpose as he told him not to shave. 

What confuses me is how could Crassus have planned for infiltrating Sinuessa before Spartacus even captured it? Furthermore how could he have planned to pay off the pirates with Caeser before he found out about the pirates' deal with Spartacus? 

You could say that Caeser was always going to infiltrate the rebels and that he was able to get to the pirates was a bonus. But I think this is weak and unlikely. Caeser could do nothing really damaging in the city except attempt to murder Spartacus or something and then die himself which is very unlikely. You could say he was sent to try to create dissent which he did do, but even this is unlikely; they had no idea there was a fued between Spartacus and Crixus prior to the infiltration.

Thus the original reason must be that he was just sent to spy on Spartacus and that paying off the pirates was not the original plan.",,False,,t5_2srqd,False,,,True,t3_1bfc96,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1bfc96/a_question_about_caeser/,

Has anyone else felt disappointed in the seeming marginalization of Crixus' role and ability?  I'm hoping he will shed much Roman blood in this upcoming season!

So at the end of ""Blood and Sand,"" Spartacus says something like, ""You can take your own path, or join with us to see Rome crumble!""

Where did that come from?

I felt like Spartacus got his vengeance with Batiatus, Crixus with Lucretia, and everyone else with the Roman guards, plus getting their freedom.  

Did I miss this grander plot to eventually take down the Romans?  When did they talk about this?

Or are they fighting slavery/gladiator...ing?  gladiating? 

At the end of ""Gods of the Arena,"" they play his victory speech again.  In the speech, he talks about seeing too many people dying at the whims of those in power, then talks about bringing Rome down... So it could be slavery.  But I feel like they didn't even really make reference to this.  Sure Varo died, and everyone was sad, but no one really said anything about how people should be free.  It seemed like the focus was just on what Batiatus was doing.

Will this be made apparent to me as I start the next season?  Or did I miss something major?  ",,False,,t5_2srqd,False,,,True,t3_1cxbjh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1cxbjh/so_i_just_finished_gods_of_the_arena_did_i_miss/,

If you haven't been aware its been rumored that a Caesar spin-off is highly likely simply given the easy marketability of the figure that is Caesar as well as the success of Spartacus. As the final episode ended we saw that Pompey came into Crassus' camp. What many would have expected, as did I, was that Crassus would argue with Pompey regarding the laurels and who truly deserves credit of finally ending the slave rebellion(of course its Crassus that deserves it), but he didn't. What came after was interesting:

&gt;CRASSUS: (to Pompey) I but honor Rome, and those of like mind that would see it flourish.

and then, after Caesar complains of Pompeii:

&gt;CRASSUS: (to Caesar) Supporting claim he will be made ally. We shall stand fearsome triumvirate. With means to bend the course of history. 

While some may say this was included to simply complete story lines and synch up with history, it still seems odd. As the audience this scene with Crassus, Caesar, and Pompey (the triumvirate mind you!!!) just seems out of place for a series finale. Again, I would have liked to see something resolved with Pompey, but instead the writers make us think of a future between these three characters before ending an entire series. While Spartacus may be done, maybe we are seeing the start of Caesar? That last scene just seems too coincidental, too easy, for the writers to end the series on. There has to be a sequel/lead-in to Caesar. Preferably with the same actors/writers/team.

What are your thoughts?
____________________________________________________

Afterthought, not sure where to interject, but also, after that line I quoted above, that Crassus said to Caesar, Caesar complains to Crassus that he always talks of the future. After this, Crassus never really answers Caesar but speaks of his own loss, his own thoughts on past, present, future. Again, why is there no resolution here? Again, my thought, they are expecting this story line to continue.

* Crixus

* Gannicus

* Oenomaus

* Donar (easily recognized by his battleaxe)

* Duro (killed by roman soldiers during the takeover at the ludus

* Rhaskos (executed in the arena after being captured)

* Liscus ( killed by Ashur while fleeing the mines)

* Mannus (killed by Ashur in the mines)

* Hamilcar (killed by Roman guards at the ludus)

* Fortis (killed by roman soldiers while fleeing the mines, his body was hung from a tree)

* Acer (tortured by guests after captured at the mines. He was killed by Ilithyia)

Of the dead gladiators, most died during the initial takeover of the ludus or in the mines while rescuing Naevia.

Why?!

I started re-watching from Episode 1 again as soon as ""For Crixus!"" rang throughout the arena in S03E09, so I am very present towards that footage. 

Season 1 was extraordinarily about the vulgarities of Rome and never shied away from them, so why now, risk compromise, in the very finale?

As demonstrated in the past, subreddits are always more about the people involved as opposed to a specific name.

What we need to do is get content going in one subreddit and work with the folks over at r/television in promoting the hell out of it, so that there is a community somewhere that will show up in the results. Plus, we may be able to get the link permanently featured in the r/television list that features all shows and names. We can also use various users connections and ideas so that it in the end there will be one subreddit that fans of the show can congregate knowing there are like minded individuals.

So we have [The Ludus](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLudus/) which I think is an awesome name and [Spartacus TV](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/) that have been generated as potential subreddits for the show.

In many shows the bad guys are just bad, and all that we see of them just deepens our hatred towards them. A bit maybe like Joffery in GoT. (though in GoT this is not very typical)


I do hope that Starz or HBO will make more series like this. A lot of cool series could be made with basis in history, myths, or even other fantasy book series.

These 3 men were seen last week. Pollux and Rabanus fought in the ""Games"" to kill Tiberius and his men. All 3 were seen at Crixus's ""funeral"" and yet in the finale they were all insulted by Spartacus. 

In the scene where the weak and the strong are to separate Spartacus means to have his last conversation with Agron only to find out that Agron and Nasir have found a way to fight. 

Spartacus gives in after seeing the brand of Batiatus and says ""I bore witness to the fall of many who have called brother. You are the last yet living. Stood with me when Batiatus's ludus was laid to ruin. You honor me by standing by my side in final conflict.""

The unknown Gladiator was even seen in the scene when Spartacus dies. While the other 2 I don't even know if they were in the episode. All 3 had the same brand and escaped from the same ludus, yet both the writers and Spartacus insult the 3 of them by not considering them ""Brother.""

Yet later on in the series there is much talk of his military and strategic experience (implying he had considerable experience even before fighting for the Romans). I'm just wondering how old people reckon he is: presumably young enough for all the insane physical feats but old enough to have amassed the experience enabling him to rise so quickly through the Ludus.

Furthermore, is Gannicus older? Where does Crixus fit in? Is Oenomaus like 50 or something?!

I think that, due to history, spartacus will be killed..there's no way of getting around that in my opinion, not sure how, by who or when but I think it'll happen. To sweeten this bitter ending, I think one of two things (or both) will happen: gannicus will escape Rome and live with the quiet slave who is in love with him (forget her name, not Saxa)..they will live out there days peacefully. Gannicus in many ways is the 'Spartacus' of the previous generation - they were both champion, they both fight with dual swords, the woman they loved were killed at the hands of a roman etc...it's these parallels that make me think they'll pick gannicus as a survivor (not to mention he is awesome).

The other is Leita will get pregnant with spartacus' child, and his legacy will live on - again, a happy/sad ending.

Looking at tonights episode and next weeks season finale [](/s ""Praetor Virinius' army was defeated. With next week being about Glabur's assault on Vesuvius and his defeat. So we can expect the finale ending with Spartacus killing Glaber"")

Looking forward into Season 3, what do you hope to see? Do you think S3 will be the end of the series, or will there be a 4th season? 

Also, the show isn't accurately portraying the mass size of the rebel and Roman armies (for understandable reasons). Spartacus' rebel army were actually in the ranks of tens of thousands, with the Roman army much larger. The TV series really ranks Spartacus' army maybe around 100 men or so. I really hope in Season 3 the armies really expand in numbers.

Since Season 2 (Vengeance) focused on Mount Vesuvius, my guess is Season 3 will be about the war with the Consular armies with Season 4 being about Crassus, and the end of the series.

Laeta told Crassus about Spartacus working with the Pirates, which I'm pretty sure happened after the pirates left on their ships.  

From there it seems he made contact with the pirates and bribed them.  But then somehow Caesar knew all about it and was ready on the docks.  Which seems impossible since he was stuck in the city and couldn't have heard anything.

The show makes it seem like Caesar was the one who bribed the pirates but how could he have known to do that?

Now, according to the history, Marcus Crassus will be the one to deliver the fatal blow to Spartacus' insurrection, so we will expect him to show up in the third season. Going back to the first season, recall Licinia, cousin (or wife?) of Crassus, being killed by Illythia. With that in mind, might we expect this unresolved murder to come to a head in the third season, with Illythia and/or Lucretia living through the finale just to be punished next season by a more powerful foe?

The whole meeting with Spartacus and Glaber was so weak.  Just so I have things straight:

Glaber and Asher slaughter that entire whore house… for what reason?  Gannicus who is never in Capua was seen there once? So everyone who is there must be in cahoots with him?

Spartacus's plan is to have Glaber come to a fort/town (of Spartacus’s choosing) with a cart of armor and only bring three men.  Spartacus then trusts him because he has his wife and decides to be honorable and only bring three men himself.  Not sure why Spartacus is Mr. Honorable now, but we’ll get to that later.  No one thinks to even check the cart? Maybe ask one of them to open it?  Crazy surprise! Glaber tries to pull a quick one.  Crixis gets owned like he does in every episode now.  Spartacus decides to wait 2 minutes before he calls his whore for backup.  (Was the chick too stupid to hear screaming and sword fighting to know it was a trap?) Glaber somehow has 100 soldiers just waiting 1 minute away (Sparty picked a great location!)  Then they have to show asher evading death 2-3 times (seems like he does that every episode now).  The old guy stays back because… oh wait, there was no reason, just to show a cool death.  

I wish Spartacus would have at least tried to kill Glaber, and maybe Glaber countered his attack or something.  Not Spartacus setting up a trap for himself.  
 
3 Episodes ago, Spartacus slaughtered an entire arena of people to get to Glaber, and now he won’t take 10 guys instead of 3 to capture glaber.  I know this show is crazy, but this last episode was awful.

Though I'm sure the scale of the war will grow much larger by the end of the season (especially if it is to be historically accurate), this division will no doubt contribute to Spartacus' eventual loss of this war (assuming historical accuracy). However, Julius Caesar was betrayed and assassinated by his close friends. Perhaps the loss of this war will cause Spartacus to have to fake his death and go into hiding, where he bides his time and slowly plots to overthrow the tyranny in a different way. What if he influences Brutus and the others, causing them to betray and murder Julius Caesar at the very end of this season?

UK fan here, just watched episode 7 and had a few questions to ask.

* **This post contains spoilers**
* **I haven't seen episode 8 yet, so don't spoil it for me!** :D

So, I just finished watching episode 7, and I'm confused about the whole situation.

At the end of episode 6 we see Spartacus and Gannicus looking at the massive ditch/wall built by Crassus. We know from episode 7 that there were Roman soldiers on the other side (small numbers) but they were there. What I don't understand is; were there Roman soldiers on both sides?

Reading that myself doesn't quite make sense! lol

During episode 7 Spartacus and a few rebels engage some of the Roman, obviously not the ones over the ditch/wall as they hadn't gone over that yet, so were there Roman soldiers over Spartacus' side of the wall? Like, were there Roman soldiers in front of the Rebels? **If so, why didn't Crassus just attack from both ends, trapping the rebels inside?** Or, **why didn't Crassus engage them from the front at night?**

We see Spartacus and the Rebels breach the wall, and then Crassus arrives looking at them standing on top of it, so I'm assuming he was on that side when the Rebels were.

Sorry if that doesn't quite make sense, I kind of understand the whole situation, but I'm unsure exactly where the Romans soldiers were located.",,False,,t5_2srqd,False,,,True,t3_1ba4ef,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1ba4ef/episode_7_questions_spoilers/,

You know how some people say ""Oh, older movies are so much better than anything new""... Well, sometimes they're right. But this is the exception. This movie was horrible. 

The acting was as dry and plastic as it could be. Kirk Douglas, who played Spartacus, was just awful. There was no emotion in him at all. The times he was supposed to be enraged or angry, he was just quiet. When he was supposed to be happy, he just had a little grin on his face. It was like watching a high school play where the actors are all untrained and immature kids. 

The dialogue and writing was too relaxed and modern. You could have taken any line from that movie and plugged it into any drama or sitcom from the 60s. There was no historical language at all. At one point a Roman soldier actually said ""Let's go get 'em boys!"" That kind of phrasing just doesn't fit in a period piece and that was just one of many examples. 

I can forgive the bad special effects and fight scenes. They didn't have much to build with back then and there were no such things as computers. 

But framing the movie as a ""Bible epic"" I can not forgive. Literally, the first few words of the film are about Christianity. In every way, they tried to paint Spartacus as a Moses or Jesus character. Him leading old people and children through the desert (I wasn't aware ancient Italy was a desert - I thought it was a fairly lush valley like it has been for hundreds of years.) Main characters from both the Roman and Slave camps are constantly brushing off the Roman gods, telling each other they don't exist. Like the film makers were saying ""Hey, we know this is set in ancient Rome and they believed in many gods, but we know they really only believed in our god, wink-wink""

Anyway, I know the new Spartacus tv series gets criticized for being to bloody, too vulgar, and too extreme; but I think it paints a more accurate picture of life back then. People died, often brutally, a lot. People had sex, sometimes out in the open, a lot. People were crude and vulgar. Just because we may have evolved beyond that, doesn't mean we shouldn't portray it like that. And we certainly shouldn't try to sugarcoat it and make it a 3 hour epic happy-time Judeo-Christian love fest like that shit movie did. 

Do yourself a favor, don't bother with the movie. There may be better remakes out there; but the one that is often held as the standard should have delivered more than that. 

Oh, I almost forgot the worst part... who decided to cast 40 year old Tony Curtis to play a 26 year old ""singer of songs"" that doesn't have him sing the whole damn movie? Further, who was honestly convinced this 40 year old dude with wrinkles and a husky voice actually looked like a house slave in his early 20s?

It is a combination of so many things that were wrong. I still find the show enjoyable, but I am not in love with it like before.

Andy was so great in the role. You could see the pain in his eyes. The driving force behind Spartacus was his lost wife, and I feel that the new actor does show this pain. He seems to be all about killing Romans. He also lacks the vulnerability of Andy. I feel like the character is just different now. The original Spartacus was man who did amazing things because he was driven from an inner pain - like a super hero. The new Spartacus just seems to be some all powerful warrior.

Quintess and Lucritia were crucial to the show. The show before was not just about Gladiators, but all sorts of socioeconomic groups fighting for power. It was this struggle that made the show great. The show had so many anti-hero's.

Ashur was amazing. Killing him was a mistake. He was the most cunning bastard and the perfect supervillan. He was the lex luthor of the show(Brains vs Brawn). I hated and loved him at the same time. He should have killed Naevia and been allowed to walk away. That would have been epic. Not the predictable crap they gave us.

The first show was very good for season 3, but we really need some great characters to make this show stick now that they have killed all the old one's off.

BUT Has anyone else noticed the changes in the second season?
How some female characters (actress's) have been either killed off or replaced with news ones that are clearly taking on the role of killers.

I personally don't see this as being good for the series at all. Part of what made this such a great and ""fresh"" show was the fact that they didn't fall into the same old tired plot / character types of the aggressive gun/sword toting woman standing on par with some guy.   Frankly I'm tired of watching female characters playing macho roles. 

What Spartacus had was devious and manipulative females (roman women) and a more noble slave girl.  It was the working and abused slave women that stood tall in this series... not the spoiled romans..  both had their devices and abilities.
But the males were mostly limited to sword play it was the women that worked at being puppet masters.

Now we're in a rearrangement of the story were Spartacus is a general and in command of thousands against the formal armies of Rome.  The problem is where does that leave the female characters? 

With the death of Mira (what a weak ending of her character) the rising of naevia (new bad actress of the series) along with the new blond dagger chick we're going to be having supposed ""bad ass"" women on the battlefield?

*""Why not ram thy cock further into my ass?""*

The women of this series were certainly dangerous enough on their own - as vipers not bulldogs. 

Whoever got into the screenwriters head and told them that they needed to give their women swords so that they could fight along the men was pushing bullshit.
I think it's a serious bad move.   Yeah they managed to have sex scenes in the tribunes tents... why not the former slaves?

It's a seriously bad move to get rid of the loyal Mira and replace her with ""?"" 
Damnit, don't let it be Naevia.  So freaking what she got raped and cut up.
BIG DEAL, do you think that any of the sex slave girls weren't raped into the business on that show? From the very start Quintus  Batiatus was taking without asking some slave while his wife watched.

Lets not make Naevia a hero in the series.. I don't want that rammed down my throat.

Naevia didn't kill Asher fairly... he was already wounded. 
He could have killed her several times but he didn't because he was betting that if he showed her mercy they might let him go.  So he kept on trading blows with her trying to get her to break and stop the attack. 
She just got lucky because he let his guard down....  

I don't want to see her praised or have people walking away think she kicked his ass (you know some are thinking that). NOTHING could be further from the truth.
and frankly it's insulting that they've framed her with in this towering heroic show as it takes her 3 times to finally cut off Ashers head. ",,False,,t5_2srqd,False,,,True,t3_rrz3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/rrz3o/the_role_of_women_in_spartacus/,
