I was ready to tell the following joke from the book, which most of you have probably heard already:


*A statistic professor plans to travel to a conference by plane. When he passes the security check, they discover a bomb in his carry-on-baggage. Of course, he is hauled off immediately for interrogation.*

*""I don't understand it!"" the interrogating officer exclaims. ""You're an accomplished professional, a caring family man, a pillar of your parish - and now you want to destroy that all by blowing up an airplane!""*

*""Sorry"", the professor interrupts him. ""I had never intended to blow up the plane.""*

*""So, for what reason else did you try to bring a bomb on board?!""*

*""Let me explain. Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an airplane is 1/1000. That's quite high if you think about it - so high that I wouldn't have any peace of mind on a flight.""*

*""And what does this have to do with you bringing a bomb on board of a plane?""*

*""You see, since the probability of one bomb being on my plane is 1/1000, the chance that there are two bombs is 1/1000000. If I already bring one, the chance of another bomb being around is actually 1/1000000, and I am much safer...""*


Unfortunately, the day I have planned to tell this joke was also the day of the Boston Marathon incident, so it would have been in poor taste to tell the joke. Even now I don't feel comfortable telling it. So if you guys have any suggestions of another joke for me to tell during class, please post it here!

1342385339.0,50,self.statistics,wlw1h,Is there interest in a group project where we take a data set and analyze it together?,55,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/wlw1h/is_there_interest_in_a_group_project_where_we/,"There are quite a bit of online data repositories (many listed on the sidebar) that contain interesting real data. I was hoping that maybe we could choose a data set each month (week?) and collectively analyze it.

The analyses may include:

1. Defining simple hypotheses and testing them.

2. Estimating various parameters.

3. Carrying out diagnostic procedures to test our model assumptions.

4. Some cool ways of visualizing the data.

I feel that this would be beneficial for statisticians regardless of skill level. If you are an expert then this may help you practice what you know and flex your statistical muscle. Beginners can also learn how the process works and pick up on tips and 'tricks' of the trade.

If this is successful then maybe we can have our own repository of methods and how to use them. Maybe start with data sets that address commonly asked questions. For example, how to compare means, contingency tables, simple ANOVA and regression, etc. Also, participants may want to provide their code so others can use it and build upon it.

I would love to get your feedback on this. Comments, suggestions, criticisms and volunteers are all welcome. Thanks.

Edit: Nice to see there's some interest in this. The next step: I have been browsing some data sets from public repositories. I will pick one and get the ball rolling by providing code for data input and basic statistical functions. Perhaps suggest some hypotheses to investigate.

**If you have a data set in mind please PM me.**

Edit2: So glad that many of you like the idea. So to start off I will pick a simple enough data set with some interesting properties that we can exploit for the first exercise. Don't like the data or have something better in mind? That's fine, just make a suggestion or volunteer to start another thread. It could be anything really -- either some famous data or something you worked on in the past -- just tell us how to get it and offer whatever necessary details that could help.

As for the format, I will provide the data set, sample code on how to read the data (in R for now; feel free to use SAS, SPSS, or whatever you're comfortable with) and code for basic analyses. Also, just to start things off, I will suggest some hypothesis and do a step by step on how to test it. Then we see where it goes from there.

**Thank you all for your suggestions, comments and enthusiasm. I hope this becomes a success.**",,False,,t5_2qhfi,1342413635.0,,,True,t3_wlw1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/wlw1h/is_there_interest_in_a_group_project_where_we/,

I have a pretty good background in mathematics, I have an undergrad degree in physics and a masters in mathematics (computational fluid dynamics). So I'm pretty knowledgeable in mathematics and do not have much difficulty learning new concepts/topics.

Only problem right now is that I haven't touched statistics since my second year of university. I never had the need to. I'm in the process of applying for jobs and it seems a lot of places require knowledge of statistics. Now I have no problem learning it again. But I would like to make a request from the /r/statistics community.

If I would like a ""working knowledge of statistics"" what are the 10 (or fewer) most important topics that I should make myself familiar with?

I figure if I have a nice list of topics. I can quickly look them up and make myself familiar with them again. I have used some stats before, but very little, so I know about mean/median/mode, SD, variation, probability distributions (due to learning quantum mechanics).

I've managed to gather a few ""facts,"" but I don't really know what they mean.

* Stan does Bayesian inference of some kind. 
* Stan uses a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sample (HMC), which is some kind of variant on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC). (If anyone wants to go into some depth on MCMC, HMC, and how they are used in bayesian inference, that would be cool. I'm new to this)
* BUGS is one of the standard tools for Bayesian inference. There are certain problems that are intractable in BUGS that Stan is capable of resolving.

I guess my question is pretty big. In short: what kinds of things would I want to use Stan to model? What are some things that Stan can do that BUGS can't? What are some things that BUGS does well? What is the need that Stan is filling? Why is everyone so excited?

I have two basic problems: I don't know much about other possible careers, and I don't know what to do to get ready for those careers.

I hear phrases like ""data-scientists"" and other phrases used like ""use a lot of stats""... and I'm intrigued. I'm open to many possible jobs, I'm just not sure where to find out what working those kinds of jobs MEANS. 

Here's my situation

* Graduated undergrad 2005; math/physics/philosophy triple major; magna cum laude; honors in physics.
* PhD in physics 2011.
* Computer programming (my biggest weakness): took one class in programming C in 2005 but use computers and program in python daily for the past 6 years. Not a programmer's programmer, but I know my way around Linux/python. I've taught myself some OOP and continue to learn.
* Dual citizen US/UK -- willing/able to work in US or UK.

I have two years to get myself ""into shape"" for a stats-based career. I'm willing to realistically spend a solid 5 hours/week to learning and practicing what needs to be done. I'm not afraid of learning/studying, and I actually really enjoy it. Also I'm not a slouch at math and have no fear of learning more. The parts of my current research that I like: analyzing different models of data, fitting models to data, and creating statistical testing of the results.

My question is in two parts:

A) Do you have specific recommendations of job-types that I should spend time researching? That is, do I sound like the kind of person that has or gets particular jobs?

B) What should I be working on for the next two years in order for me to have the best shot at getting these jobs? Anything from math to learn, computer programs to learn, to... really anything you think I'd need (or that people who hire would want to see) to be successful at this kind of career.

Things I'm currently working on: taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.

As a program, is so full of inconsitencies and unintuitive issues, I am ready to break my computer. I have complained to no end, but I always hear the same excuse: ""It's a *validated* piece of software."" I disagree! What arbitrary criteria make software ""validated""? You can't read or understand source code and the documentation never mentions the routines or methods for fitting models, unlike R. 

*The SAS license is crushingly expensive* but that doesn't necessarily mean it's any better or worse than R. In fact, the core development team for R has some of this generation's best statisticians collaborating on its development: Duncan Murdoch, Robert Gentleman, Frank Harrell Jr., etc. I can download the source code for R, compile the binaries myself, and read help files which tell me exactly how models were fit. For instance, all GLMs are fit using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. That sounds like validated software to me!

Lastly, *SAS hinders the understanding of statistics*. If you call proc glm and supply a binary adjustment variable, the glm procedure inherits an ANOVA procedure and prints the usual ANOVA output, sum of squares stuff. Why not a t-test? It completely masks the estimate of interest: a mean difference comparing the Yes group to Nos. SAS additionally gives pages and pages of worthless output. So when there's one thing you want, it's buried in a haystack. This wastes paper! Worse still, the eager statistician has more output in front of him or her to overinterpret. Sometimes, you just fit a linear model and report a coefficient and a confidence interval and you're done. I don't need ANOVA or likelihood information (if I did, I'd be willing to do extra work to extract them).

*SAS syntax and layout is terrible*! There is no equivalence equality distinction. You write code like:

    if time = 1 then time = 0;

The assignment operator is *reversed* for ODS output. Who ever had this terrible idea? I'd rate it with the system lag Windows does every time there's a minor security issue: worst ideas in programming, ever! Their bizarre data / proc this and that causes programs to become hideously bloated every time a simple sort or parse is called. SAS documentation doesn't have examples! Their syntax is so goddamn confusing and weird, this is inexcusible! Online help resources, except for UCLA, are all extremely deprecated! The SAS community is a private, unhelpful bunch. And SAS's GUI looks like Win 3.1, am I right?

*R is free as in beer and speech* and incorporation could greatly improve the regulatory research field. User questions are very well documented and it's easy to just Google solutions for simple problems.  It is by far MORE capable than SAS and I just don't believe the rumor that SAS is better with large datasets. I have worked with millions of rows of data with hundreds of variables and both are equally slow. As for ""validated"" software: Validation is a matter of documentation and independent reproduction of results using a blinded 3rd party agent without conflict of interest. Validation is not guaranteed by a single statistical software. I can generate the wrong results in either program!

I don't frequently bump into R's warts--when I do it usually involves memory or the need to do something a bit more general purpose.

A while back, I read about [Incanter, an R-inspired system](http://incanter.org/), built on [clojure](http://clojure.org/) that purports to have all the goodness that Ihaka and Lang call for. Perhaps like others, I've been intrigued by Incanter, but have never actually used it beyond punching in an example or two. My reasons thus far for not using it:

* I don't know it
* I strongly suspect that it's missing the breadth of packages that R has
* RStudio (yeah, yeah, I should be using ESS--I'm learning!)

An idea I've been kicking around of late is to pick a CRAN package that I use and that doesn't exist in Incanter, and re-implement it in Clojure / Incanter. I mostly view this as a way of learning something new, and expanding my understanding of something old.

Not it's value, but the statistic itself (the estimator, not the estimate). 

As I discussed in my comment in that thread, there are serious issues with that method, as well as the alternative proposed in the parent comment to mine. What I'm thinking of is an estimator for the **probability that a first marriage today will end in divorce**, based on current trends. 

I'm not sure if it's practical to isolate first marriages (and divorces of first marriages) from publicly available data, but assuming it is, how would you go about constructing such an estimator? I'm just looking for back-of-the-envelope ideas, but if you feel like turning this into a thing, knock yourself out. Also, if anyone wants to link to any datasets that would help with this, that would be really cool. And if anyone who actually works with this kind of data wants to chime in on the hows and whys, that would be extra super cool.

Silver has been getting a ton of publicity because of it, and I'm sure many of the statisticians that read /r/statistics and hadn't heard of him before the election have become aware of him in the past week.

I'm working on a BA in Statistics and just started reading it.  Silver explains very well, in laymen's terms, the issues with collecting meaningful data in a sea of useless or misleading information.

How do people with a lot more experience in Statistics feel about Silver in general and his work?  One common criticism I've heard is that his climate change chapter is problematic for some.

I'm also wondering whether or not there's a mistake on Silver's chart on Page 28.

Behind this provocative title hides a legit question about confidence intervals. I am a teacher assistant and will teach stats to undergrads, and I don't want them to make the classical mistake that a ""95% confidence interval means that there is a probability of 95% that the true value of the parameter lies in the constructed interval"" which is the definition of a Bayesian Credible Interval. But on the other hand, the real definition of confidence intervals makes them feel contrived, at least to me.

So, realistically, are CIs useful?

I'm currently an economic undergrad student, and I've started working with statistical programming software.  They say work with what you know, so I'm getting my feet wet with R by doing some deck-building analysis.

A few days ago, I came up with a question regarding optimal deck construction within rigid constraints and set out to solve it using R.  It was a lot of fun, and I'm very proud of what I whipped together.  

I wrote everything out in mathy language in order to present my 'findings' to my friends, who are avid magic players themselves.  Unfortunately, this means what I wrote is geared more towards magic players than statisticians.

I can assure you all the conclusions I've made regarding the rules of the game are spot-on, it's the probability calculations I'm less confident with.  If anyone stumbles across an error, I'd absolutely love to hear about it.

* 1) R  
* 2) SAS
* 3) Python 
* 4) C++
* 5) [Hadoop](https://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hadoop#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=hadoop&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=hadoop&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=0l0l0l3846l0l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=7f4a23307f26fc94&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949)  

Further it seems that [Hadoop](https://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hadoop#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=hadoop&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=hadoop&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=0l0l0l3846l0l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=7f4a23307f26fc94&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949), a tool for distributed computing, seems to differentiate the statistics / ML jobs into those that are business as usual (same 'ole theory) and those offered at start-ups (new advanced ML techniques). 

 I know R and SAS well, and over the next year plan to improve my C++ and learn to use it within R, and learn Python and Hadoop.  

Right now I'm focusing on Hadoop.  I just bought the [O'Reilly reference for Hadoop](http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Definitive-Guide-Tom-White/dp/1449389732/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322850703&amp;sr=8-1), do y'all have any other good references or suggestions on learning Hadoop?  I've seen warnings that it's best to know Java first, which I know none of -- do you have thoughts on this?

I do have experience running ML routines in R (for [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com)) that take a while for my laptop i7 to complete.  I have a laptop with an Intel Core 2 Duo that I was thinking about ""Hadooping"" along with my i7 for these ML problems.  Thoughts?  Would this be a good experiment to learn Hadoop?

I was told the salary would be attractive, which... well, it's *okay* (I'm certainly able to finance all my habits, which is a plus, but I don't feel comfortable and I'm not really doing what makes me happy). Every day I struggle with this and return to a few points:

1. It's not exciting as it was in grad school.

2. This shit is so boring.

3. I have 0 leverage as a monkey on the major decisions revolving around my work. ""run the crosstabs again, maybe we'll see something different this time"".

4. I get nothing done because I'm unmotivated.

Private Sector... I think I'm breaking up with you, but...

1. I struggle with the feeling I burned bridges with past connections (academic, research)

2. My advisors are MIA and I feel insanely awkward asking them to help get me back on track again.

3. I feel way, way dumber than I ever was.

Private Sector, I think we're in an emotionally abusive relationship and I've been cheating on you. Academia, can we make it work? I loved you all along! I want to go all the way! I wanna be in you!

How does your humble statistics mod ask its community for guidance? What would *you* expect to do or see either in my position or from the point of view of your admission community. My grad school GPA was modest, not great (3.5) I have 0 pubs, I have many, many ideas floating around and I'm just looking for an avenue to do much, to see much but I feel totally lost and disadvantaged.

Is this a pipe dream or tangible reality? What would I do to buffer my opportunities? Whom do I talk to? What do I do?

Alternately, is it me? Am I the one who's unfaithful? Should I be biting the bullet and learning that my (nominal) work life is going to be 40% reading email 40% going through rows of data 18% meetings, and 2% statistics? (need to standardize that to reddit time, of course). I need to break through the depressing lull I'm in.

I think what I *really* need is a vacation. I haven't had 2 weeks off in 5 years. I tried to plead my case, but it's near hopeless since they need ""statisticians on hand"". Is it just legitimate burn out that I'm dealing with? 

I can say that, were I admitted to a program, I would take a few *months* off so I could coincidentally kill 2 birds with one stone.

Anyway... I know this isn't livejournal but buried in there ARE a couple of real questions from a breathing, barely surviving statistician.

Also, for your reference, I know in the Detroit office major boons to your application will be demonstrated knowledge or experience with *R*, *Minitab*, *SQL*, financial stats, and the mortgage business. There are some other really sought after skill-sets (particularly data mining and database stuff), but they are for people who are higher up in the food chain than me and I'm not familiar with them.

Anyway, that's not to say you should feel discouraged if you don't have any particular facility with those skill sets. It'll just be helpful if you do have them to emphasis those on resumes!

The company and its sister companies are growing like crazy.

I am a junior in a pretty good ranked statistics program. I am currently looking at possible phd programs, and trying to nail down what will make me the most competitive. I think that coming from a statistics undergrad program is a great start, as most people come from math/engineering. Also, I have already done all of my calculus and linear algebra; I am in my second semester of calc-based probability theory, I have taken an ANOVA class, and an applied methods course. I also will be taking Real Analysis and time series in the fall. 

My interests have been falling somewhere around applied statistical methods for epidemiology, so Biostatistics or Public Health is definitely in the mix.

unlike Unix). If you need to find out what your system drives are, go to Network Drives in Windows explorer, and look at already mapped letters which will 
show the cross-platform compatible name of that drive.

2. Absolute versus relative path references: I have recently overhauled *all* of my code to get rid of relative path references entirely. I now have a ctl.r 
file that I source that points to all locations for a project, including directories: man, doc, rpt, src, dat, tab, fig, and so on. This allows me to swap 
and copy and completely gut out project directory structures so I only have to change one file to know where to find all the relevant materials for that 
project. This is an issue because your scheduler may run batch R from some completely arbitrary directory, '//HOME/schedulers/ctlcharts/' and if you say to 
export a './fig/myGraphic.pdf' then your system will look in '//HOME/schedulers/ctlcharts/fig' regardless of whether it exists or not. This can run into 
write permission problems and cause your program to break.

3. The `setwd()` command should be deprecated. This is only convenient when you've launched interactive R in Windows from a directory that doesn't make sense 
to you. You can't use that command from its interactive shell in Unix.

**System commands**:

1. Windows shell is a sad thing. I use it for ping but whenever I need to do more than that I get frustrated and use Cygwin instead. Nonetheless, with 
Cygwin, under the hood is a Windows shell and its only translating Unix commands to Windows syntax where applicable. So if your R script uses `system(""mv 
oldFile newFile""`), Unix is happy as a clam whereas Windows says, ""WAIT, MV? WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?!"". The kosher way to manipulate files in the 
system directory is with R's host of `file.*` commands. `file.remove` to delete, `file.copy` to... well you get it.

2. When all else fails, throw an ifelse switch for the right syntax
You can use R to determine what system you're using with `Sys.info()[1]`. Then use your Windows syntax if it's Windows and your Unix syntax if it's Unix.

*Por exemplo*

    if (Sys.info()[1] == 'Windows') {
      system('copy //Home/myfig.pdf //Groups/myproject/fig/myfig.pdf')
    } else {
      system('cp //Home/myfig.pdf //Groups/myproject/fig/myfig.pdf')

Basic inputs to the model: QB ratings, rush yards/attempt, pass yards/attempt, some defense stats, and I'll add in some more complicated ones eventually (3rd down efficiency, Red zone stats). My dependent variable is the final score differential (home score - away score)

My question:
Is there a 'right' way to choose inputs to my model?:
a) Individual team stats, Home QB Rating, Away QB Rating

b) Differences, Home QB Rating - Away QB Rating (since my dependent variable is a difference in scores)

Also, I'm happy to read books (textbooks even), just keep in mind I'm at the baby-steps stage of this. :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning! I'm a perpetual undergraduate at this point (starting year 6 this Fall and looking at least at another 2-3 years before I'll apply to a graduate school - I'd graduated previously, worked in industry for 3 years, had an opportunity to return to school and seized it). Having taken two introductory statistics courses, one as a general statistics course and the other as an applied statistics to the social sciences (Less theory, more application, wider variety of tests and understanding), I've realized the actual introductory applications using algorithms with light algebra are great, but simple (Mathematically).

Halfway through my second course, I began wondering if Statistics required any heavy-lifting math at all, or would I just be playing with algebra my entire Stats career? And then I tried to make some connections between what I'd learned in class and other math classes I've taken like Calc. The stats book had about two lines explaining that on a normal curve, the first standard deviation is located at the area in the curve where the slope changes from exponentially negative to converging on zero. Except the book didn't even use any mathematical terms like that, it literally said where the line stops dropping so steeply and begins to even out. 

And then I realized that's a point of inflection in the curve (Second derivative = 0). And it was the first time I actually saw any relevance to Calculus or math at a higher level than algebra. Of course, at that point, a handful more questions and observations clicked; the curve itself has a fantastic equation, the area under the curve that we talk about for SD +-1 being 68%, SD +- 2 being 95%, etc is literally the area under the curve which I can calculate with calculus, etc.

And then I felt bad. Neither of my courses actually connected any of this to Calculus or any other class outside of ""Hey, welcome to stats, here is the basic theory, and here's a bunch of equations and tests and what they mean! You can now do surveys, polls, and find significant results!"".

So, obviously, there's a lot of Math behind Stats and I haven't really researched much of it because I have absolutely no idea where to begin. What's essential to actually understanding the theory behind where statistics was derived? Where the equations come from, where the significance of it all comes from? What should I be reading, studying, and exposing myself to? My biggest problem with learning Calculus was that the only application they gave us was ""Use it to find the volume of this tin can!"", or other similar applications which were great for demonstration but felt meaningless in the real world.

I'm thinking you are the proper folks to pose this question to, since I'm not getting help from meeting people face-to-face else where. Please, redirect me if I'm way off. Here it goes.

I'm comparing proportions of two groups (i.e., comparing percent occurrence of an organism in one group to percent occurence in the other group). My groups are ""natural"" and ""man-made"", which represents the type of habitat that was sampled. Both groups include 26 sample sites (is it proper to say n=26 for both groups?), so 52 sample sites overall.

Of the ""natural"" group, it is split into ""stream"" and ""pond"", of which there are 14 and 12 sample sites, respectively.

I want to test if the proportion of organisms occurring in ""man-made"" is different than ""natural"", and then if the ""stream"" is different than ""pond"". However, I'm not sure if a chi-square or a t-test is more appropriate. Though I've taken some stats classes, it has been a while and it seems I'm not too good at re-teaching it to myself. Would somebody mind explaing which test is more appropriate and why?

I came across an article (the world is round p &lt; .05, by Cohen, 1994) and I've learned that my understanding of p-values is not correct.


Since, I've read a dozen or so articles on p values, and I'm not fully getting it.  

I get why it's not what most people think it is, but I'm having a hard time figuring out why it's semi-useless.

Like let's say I do a test, I want to know if my Drug is better than a placebo.

I find Drug has a mortality rate of 3%
Placebo = 10%
p = .01.

Now I know that this means that that: if it is true that there is no
difference in mortality outcomes between a placebo and my drug, then
there is a 1% chance that I observed this difference (or a greater
difference).

However, my question is, why isn't that good evidence that there is a
difference? in other words, I know that it doesn't mean ""there is only
a 1% chance that there is no difference"" but doesn't it say something? and if so what does it say? 

Thanks!

**Edit** If you could dumb it down / provide examples that would be very helpful; the whole comparing it to Bayesian statistics is going over my head

Anyways, what are the pros and cons of both? Furthermore, should I master both programs or just focus on one?

Does it follow that one can't make inferences about a parameter using anything other than its prior distribution and the likelihood function? [Dennis 1996](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~brian/reprints/Dennis_Ecological_Applications_1996.pdf) puts it like this:

&gt; In the Bayesian approach, all conclusions about the value of the parameter are embodied in the posterior pdf. The data enter the conclusions only through the likelihood function… In particular, no sample-space probabilities, other than the actual realized value of the likelihood function, are admitted into the conclusions (Lindley 1982, 1990). Sample-space probabilities, such as the probability that a test statistic might exceed a critical value, involve ""data that didn't happen"", are are excluded from the analysis. The principle of including only the actual data in the analysis excluding consideration of all other sample-space possibilities is known as the ""likelihood principle"".

The fallout includes, for instance, [Example 11.10 in Wasserman](http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/2834/wassermanexample.png), where you're trying to estimate *c* given that *f*(*x*) = *c**g*(*x*) for some unknown PDF *f* and a known function *g* (imagining that *g* is too ugly or *x* is too high-dimensional to just compute *c* as the reciprocal of the integral of *g*) but from a Bayesian perspective, a sample from *f*(*x*) provides no information about *c*.

From a philosophical perspective, this makes no sense to me. Shouldn't my conclusions about a thing depend not only on my prior beliefs (including preexisting *knowledge*) about the thing itself but also about other things that may have implications for said thing? Is the problem with the particular method used to compute posterior distributions rather than the more general idea of Bayesian inference?

Among other things, I wound up taking on a project that was essentially statistical analysis of a somewhat large dataset in SPSS. Now, I don't own SPSS, so I've been using the trial version up to this point. It's nothing I haven't done before, and the pay's been good.

The project may involve future work; however, like I said, I'm dealing with the trial version of SPSS, and the full version isn't the cheapest thing.

What I'm wondering is, might it be just as straightforward to do any future work with R instead? I have a copy, and the data's been into SPSS up to this point - I'd just need to transfer the SPSS dataset to an R dataset, which I imagine would be doable. (I've worked with R in the past, so there shouldn't be any problems there.) But might there be some things SPSS can do with that data that R cannot? Thus far, I've done correlations and some regression (including a logistic regression), along with some recoding of variables.

I guess what I'm getting at is, could I use R for future work? Or would I absolutely positively need SPSS (in which case I think the full version's $100/1 year, if I have that right)?",,False,,t5_2qhfi,1344532370.0,,,True,t3_xx0fz,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/xx0fz/r_vs_spss/,

The thought of returning to school to pursue a master's degree in statistics has become very appealing recently.  In the 8th grade I took my first calculus course a local community college.  In high school I took the IB calc series freshman/sophomore year and then went to a local university junior/senior year to take courses in multivar. calc, linear algebra, and complex analysis.  I liked everything math back then!  Once I got to college I decided upon engineering and had the chance to take ODE, PDE, numerical methods, intro to stats, and the mathematical ""modeling"" classes inherent to an engineering degree.  I considered a second major in math but was completely turned off after trying my hand at abstract algebra because I couldn't stand the rigor of proofs inherent in pure mathematics.  I am much more of a practical, hands-on type of math lover.  I'm pretty curious by nature, love numbers, data, visualizations, and prefer to self-teach in most topics.  Statistics seems like a nice field for me to utilize my skills and love for math without all of the axiomatic, rigorous mumbo jumbo!

Before I take any plunge into applying to graduate programs, I want to have a better sense of the skills and interests a statistician possesses.  

What sort of questions should I be asking myself to determine if statistics will appeal to me?  What resources or websites are out there that would give me a sense of what day-to-day life is like for a statistician?

Sorry to be so vague, I am happy to clarify on any points if a more refined line of questioning is required.  Really would appreciate any input from y'all!  ",,False,,t5_2qhfi,False,,,True,t3_1j6xmf,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1j6xmf/is_a_career_in_statistics_right_for_me_what/,

I'm an undergrad in ""Information Science"" and as such I have several basic and intermediate stats classes under my belt. I've been pretty successful in my program, and have been asked to be a TA in the past.  My program teaches R alongside its intro to statistics class as a way to get students ready for ""large datasets"" from the get-go. This semester, I'm going to be a lab leader for one of these classes. When I took the class (about a year ago), the lectures and tests focused on traditional statistics 101 stuff, whereas the labs and homeworks focused on a practical application using large, real world data with R. When I took it, we used RStudio, and for the most part we used it like a glorified calculator (we don't delve into using classes or loops or any of the more advanced parts of the language until later classes)

I've learned a couple programming languages in my college career, and while I've found that while R is a powerful and useful tool, it's not exactly the most beginner-friendly language, especially since some of the students in this class have never been exposed to programming at all. I remember being really confused and annoyed when I was first learning about pbinom(), dbinom(), and qbinom() for example.

So now that I'm going to be one of the lab leaders, it's essentially my job to teach total novices the basics of R, and for at least half of them it's going to be their first exposure to any programming language. **I'm wondering what advice you statistical, R-using geniuses might have for me.** Also, one of the things I've done in the past is to [make youtube videos of course content](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL973E2637D4E51E9C) so that students can review without needing to come to my office hours. This is actually done a lot for me in terms of getting me noticed by faculty, and I intend to keep doing it, so I'll probably be making screencasts of R stuff as well. **So, if anyone in here has ever taught R to total newbies, I'd really appreciate any advice you could offer.**

I'm an undergraduate right now. I have a passion for data science. I was first turned on to this track when I discovered an old Facebook app called Nexus. It was a little bit of Friend Wheel with a lotta bit of graph theory. I'm at a well-regarded school for computer science, with a double major in statistics. You can find it quickly enough if you search through my post history.

Here's my problem: my year (and the job world in general) is riddled with tons of postings for software positions. Some places have backend database positions, some places have front end websites or apps postions. Could I do one of these? Maybe. I'd be awful at it, though. My programming experience so far has been in distributed systems, parallel and functional programming, and language processing (both speech and natural written). But that's not even what I really want to do. I've also taken classes in statistical computing, probability inference, and data visualization. Statistical graphics was probably my favorite class that I have ever taken so far.

I'm not a biotic god, but I'm pretty good at R. And a wealth of other languages. Python, C, Java, even OCaml.

Most people (the friends, the faculty, the recruiters) seem to think I've got a good head and that I know what I want to do. Give me an industry, a problem, and a data set. I want to make something happen. My problem isn't getting my foot in the door. It's finding the right door.

The jobs that I've been looking into? Most of them require either last year of BS, or pursuing an MS or PhD. Kind of a disconnect. What should I be doing right now? Where should I be looking? LinkedIn and my school's internal jobs database are coming up short (call it a failure of the website to let me search for the job title ""data science""). Not a ton of alumni have taken the path that I've blazed for myself (the statistics department here is hideously tiny, maybe 30 students max, and most of them are economics/stat double majors), but that doesn't exclude the possibility that alumni are doing what I'm interested in.

My classmates and I are trying to convince our department head to invest in our own server.  My department is very small and a good portion of the students are theorists, so only about 10-15 students would be actively submitting jobs. 

I'm trying to put together a proposal to bring to the committee with purchasing power, but my knowledge on servers is rather limited and my numerous web searches have not proven fruitful.

What are the kind of specs I should look for in a server and where are some good places to get price quotes from (I assume I can get some sort of educational discount)?  I want something comparable to the current cluster, which has 8 nodes and 64gb of RAM.  We also have a scarcity of computer access for graduate students, so we'd like to order several thin-clients (or possible use older computers as dummy terminals).    

We would also like the server to be self-administered (i.e. graduate students have administrator privileges), because we have had so many issues in the past with system administrators outright refusing to install updates.  Are there any good web resources for setting up and maintaining such a server?  Is it reasonable that graduate students with no experience in system administration, but a decent knowledge of linux could maintain a server.

Especially with respect to model misspecification. But, of course, I'm not a Harvard professor, so maybe I should shut up.

I'm a recent college graduate who just received a BA in psychology a few weeks ago, and I am now preparing to enter that mysterious alternate universe known as ""the real world.""  The problem is that I am now uncertain if I want to pursue psychology any further (for grad school or professionally).  Within the past year, I have seen a number of cases in which prominent psychologists have misused, abused or misrepresented the results of statistical tests for their own gain (e.g., Bem, Stapel*) and I just don't feel confident that psychology as a field can actually produce valid conclusions unless it re-vamps its methods significantly.  I've been following efforts to introduce Bayesian statistics into behavioral science, but it doesn't seem like they are anywhere near being fully adopted.

To get more to the point, I find that I am now much more interested in the logic underlying the tests used in psychology than psychology itself.  It's just that psychology, although producing some particularly compelling studies, also seems to contradict itself too often to be as useful as it could be.  Relatedly, I often get the impression that psychology overgeneralizes too much, producing a portrait of human behavior that is far from universal.  I want to note that I am not trying to disparage psychology in saying this (much of my present perspective is derived from my coursework in cultural psychology and neuro), but I do believe that its present modus operandi needs to be critiqued and improved.  It is my conviction that a great deal of this criticism must come from the world of statistics, and I would like to look more towards the statistical worldview.

I was thus wondering how possible it would be to re-orient myself toward stats from psych, and if any statisticians in this subreddit started out as psychologists or in similar non-stats fields.  I know how to perform basic tests (chi-squares, t-tests, ANOVAs, regression, etc) in SPSS from my coursework in methodology, so I'm not a complete novice to the field, but I don't know the maths necessary for a deeper understanding of these tests (i.e., I haven't taken Linear Algebra, and I haven't touched Calc since high school).  Is it practical for me to teach myself what I don't know and pursue graduate school?  Are there any jobs I could do in the meantime that might help me improve my skill set and give me a deeper understanding of tests? Are there any perilous traps that should be avoided?  Many thanks, internet world!

*Yes, I know- I can only think of two oddballs out of the entire population of psychologists, so maybe my impression is a bit too skewed.

edit:  Thank you very much again for your input, everybody!  I actually somehow managed to never hear about quantitative psych as an undergrad (or at least I didn't grasp that it was a pursuable field of study; I think I may have stumbled upon r/mathpsych once or twice here on reddit, but it didn't sink in that this was something I could get in to separate from the other psych domains).

Say I have 3 boxes, each with two drawers, each of which may or may not contain a coin.

Box I: both drawers contain a coin.
Box II: one drawer contains a coin.
Box III: neither drawer contains a coin.

Say I pick a box at random and open a drawer and it contains a coin. What are the odds that the second drawer will also contain a coin? 

**Logic**: Well, since I've found a coin, and there are two boxes with coins, then there's a 50/50 chance that I've chosen the box with two coins. P = 0.5.

**Baye's Rule**, which states: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)

where 

A = choosing box I (1/3) = .333.
B = finding a coin in a drawer (3/6) = .5.
A|B = having chosen box I given that I've found a coin.
B|A = finding a coin given that I've chosen box I (2/2) = 1.0.

P(A|B)  
= (1.0)*(.333)/(.5)
= 0.667

so...why are these probabilities different? Am I misunderstanding Baye's rule or is my logic flawed?

In intro stats courses, you learn about normal distributions, and how they show up all the time in everyday life (i.e. if you measure the heights of a lot of people, they will be approximately normally distributed).  

But what's the history of this function?  I can think of three possibilities: 

* Scientists and/or mathematicians had a lot of data (of normally distributed variables like height) and noticed that when you plotted the frequencies, they tended to converge to a specific function.  
* Instead, they noticed patterns in the data (2/3 of the data fall within one sd of the mean, almost all fall within three sd of the mean, etc...) and wrote a mathematical equation that fit those parameters.  
* They already had this equation for some reason, then noticed that real-word data tended to follow it.

In the first two scenarios, the equation was designed to fit data, and in the third, the data was found to fit the equation.

In high school, I asked my stats teacher, and she didn't really give me an answer.

Some we have tagged as being affiliated to specific marketing campaigns.  Some of these campaigns have very little data associated with them (few registrations or conversions).

What I would like at the end of the day is a best guess at Lifetime Value and Conversion Rate so we can make breakeven decisions about these marketing campaigns early on.  Both LTV and Conversion Rate take some time to ""stabilize"".  I can come up with a number for our population in general pretty easily.  In plain English: we expect X% of accounts to convert and to pay $Y over the course of their tenure.

But I don't want to assume that each affiliate is the same as the general population.  But I also don't want to judge future accounts of that affiliate based on very small numbers of past accounts for some of them.  It seems like Bayesian inference is the way to go.

I remember the basic math being not that difficult.  Conversion Rate would be a proportion, LTV more continuous.  I can get Standard Deviation for LTV as well.  I would prefer to break the population into cohorts based on the month they registered.

Q1: Am I way off-base here?

Total employees I know that received some type of bonus: 35;
Out of the 35:
31 got less than the stated bonus $x;
4 got the stated bonus $x; 
0 got more than the stated bonus $x;

Please tell me what is the likelihood that the sample data could be true given the overall data.  I don't know the lingo please tell me the confidence level or whatever else seems relevant for what I am after here! Please show/explain your work so I can see it! Most specifically I would also like to know, based on my sample data, what is the likelihood 56% of the 214 employees got $x or higher as their bonus as my employer claims.  Thanks!!

EDIT: For purposes of this problem, lets say the likelihood of talking about bonus is equal for everyone, and not add any other unstated variables (i.e. maybe everyone I know sucks at their job etc.)

ANSWER: The chi-square test measures the likelihood that a given frequency distribution (your sample of employees' bonuses) was drawn from a theoretical probability distribution (your employer's statements).
The p-value is the probability of observing your sample if it came from the alleged distribution. The p-value here is 5.6 x 10-7 or 0.0000005608 or 1/1,783,167.

I'm torn between the track of being a statistics professor and the track to become an actuary. I was really unhappy as a mathematics major for quite a few semesters, so my GPA tanked to around 2.8 and now that I'm a stats major, I'm pretty I sure I could pull it up to a 3.0 before I'm done but that's about it. I go to UCF and my school has a graduate statistics program desperate for students, so I'm sure I could at least get into the program here, but with a 3.0 I'm not sure I'd be able to get into many schools. Without a school with name recognition, how hard is it to get into Ph.D programs? Also, I think I want to get more into college level teaching than researching, is that common for statistics doctorates? 

On the other hand, I passed Exam P on my first go and feel like I have the ability to pass FM on my first go if I took it in August like I was originally planning. I know it would again be a bit of a challenge getting into the field with such a low GPA, but if I did I'd have it in for the rest of my career. I just feel like I wouldn't be as fulfilled as I would be going to grad school and eventually becoming a professor. I don't know.

Occasionally, I go to a bar or a restaurant which is plush enough to have individual, lockable bathrooms. They seemingly always have ""Men"" and ""Women"" written on the door. I guess I can understand that some men may not want to use the same public restroom that a woman used and *vice versa*. The trade-off is that there may be, randomly, many men lined-up to use a men's room while the women's room(s) are completely free. And lines during peak hours can be atrocious. 

The thought is: how much could we gain by allowing men and women to use the same bathrooms if they can overcome their reservations in doing so? By removing the labels, any available bathroom can be occupied, so if there is randomly a large number of men in line, they can use bathrooms which otherwise would have been for women.

Here are just the ""special case"" details / assumptions:

* 20 men and 20 women in the restaurant
* 2 bathrooms (in one scenario unlabeled, in another open)
* each person uses the bathroom at a rate of once every hour
* each bathroom user spends 5 minutes in the loo
* the inter-arrival times between bathroom visitors are independent, and exponentially distributed.

The procedure that generates the 95% CI will return an interval that contains mu 95% of the time, but the probability that the particular interval we calculated here, [1 3], contains mu is either 1 or 0 (depending on whether this fixed interval does in fact contain the fixed value of mu).

Here is my question. Is there not still a valid sense in which we could say that there is a 95% probability that the interval [1 3] contains mu? Perhaps the objective probability is either 0 or 1, but we don't have access to this information. What we do know is that in a sense, we have picked a CI at random from a hat in which 95% of the CIs contain mu. In this sense we could say there's a 95% probability we've picked one of the CIs that contains mu.

The idea may be clearer with another example. Draw a card at random from a deck of cards, without looking at it. What is the probability that the card you have drawn is a spade? There is a sense in which, once you have selected the card, the probability that it is a spade is either 1 or 0. Either it is or isn't a spade. But there is also a sense in which it makes sense for you to say, ""there is a 25% chance that this is a spade."" Here we are characterizing the uncertainty of your knowledge rather than the uncertainty in the actual outcome.

I've been promoted twice, from ""statistician"" to ""senior statistician"" to ""principal statistician"" which I think is pretty atypical for someone coming from the background I did. Anyway, I like the kind of work that I do (mostly mixed/multilevel modeling and some seriously cool Bayesian machine learning stuff!) but I'd like to get exposed to a wider variety of problems. That, and I LOVE meeting and talking to people about their data and helping them figure out what they want to get out of it. Consulting, as a career, seems like the way to go about doing that, but I have no idea where I'd even start or how I'd find clients. And I'm not sure if it's even possible to be taken seriously as a consultant without at least a master's. 

I've considered doing data science, as I'm getting hit up a lot by recruiters from places like FB/LinkedIn/Google, etc., but I'm not sure yet if that kind of role's a good fit for me. At this point, I feel like I have two options, really, if I want to stay in this field. First, I could get a data science job -- it'd be slightly more $$, there'd be a lot more stuff going on (which would be a big plus for me), and I think there'd be more opportunities to advance. Maybe it's because I live in the SF tech bubble, but it doesn't feel like there are a whole lot of opportunities around here for statisticians with a BS, beyond doing data science, that is.

Second, I could go to grad school and work my way into consulting; this assumes that a grad degree is necessary for consulting. What's discouraging me from doing #2 is that I didn't have that great of a GPA (~3.3-3.4) from undergrad at a pretty tough school, and whenever I read stats grad school advice threads, GPA seems so, so important. That could be because so much of the advice is geared to undergrads, and I've been out of school and working for a while now. So I guess I don't have a good idea of how much, if at all, my experience would make up for my GPA, and that's something I need to figure out. And if it does, I don't know what schools I'd have a good chance of getting into. I have a pretty good idea of the kind of work I'd like to do: very applied, maybe even biostats, but with a Bayesian flavor.

Thanks guys!

I have found references which indicate that First Order limit theory for resampling was known to laplace by 1810, this would most likely be the development of the Central Limit Theorem. Which states that given a strongly non normal sample size the distribution of means will be approximately normal for sample sizes over 30

The Second Order properties were discovered by Chebyshev in the late 19th century, I believe this is the Chebyshev inequality.  This states that in any probability distribution nearly all values will be close to the mean.  This inequality can be used to prove the Weak Law of Large Numbers.

The way I understand it, each of these two theories can be used to find estimates for finite variances the same way the Strong Law of Large Numbers can be used to find them for infinite variances.

This all points to the ""law of averages"" that over time the sample proportion will get closer to the true proportion.  This would seem to imply that resampling methods such as jackknife and bootstrap capitalize on these facts to provide more variances than are actually contained in the dataset by either systematically or randomly reusing and redistributing the variances.(depending on the method used)

I am not asking for a mathematic treatise here...just if I am on the right track.  I would like to be able to explain this in as simple terms as possible.

I received my bachelors in marketing a couple years ago. It's a big change, but I've decided to pursue a PhD in stats.

The problem is that my college math load was light. I have credit for calc 3 and an intro to statistics class. My plan going forward is to do some 'self guided' online math classes through a university for linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and intro to probability. Then night classes at some local universities for real analysis, PDEs, and whatever other stats classes I can take.

I've browsed the CS and math advice for grad schools, and I seem to be way, way behind even with classes. I can't do any relevant internships, and letters of references will have a hard time judging my advanced math abilities. My small advantage is that I can code fairly well. I would like to put together a website with examples of statistic and programming work as a portfolio. 

Do I stand a chance at a top grad school phd program? or should I opt to pay for a masters first? Advice?

edit: thanks all for the opinions.  

I think i need to explore my options more. I'm attracted to the post-bac so i have a more complete understanding of the field, but the time and cost involved is pretty steep. Interestingly enough, there is a private university near me that offers a masters in applied stats and only looks for basic calc and intro to stats as prereqs to the program. I'm unsure if something so lax is worthwhile, but I am checking it out. It kind of sucks wanting a good program while being so underqualified.

I'm collecting data on Diablo 3. If you're not familiar with it, the game involves building a character with various skills and abilities and killing monsters to get better gear to kill more, tougher monsters.

The armor and gear you wear can have various properties.  Wearing items with ""magic find"" increases the chances of finding better items. I'm specifically looking at two things: 1) how ""magic find"" affects the quality of items you find while killing monsters and 2) how quickly I can find special items depending on which part of the game I play.

For the first question, I'm trying to decide if the amount of magic find gear worn only affects the category of the item (plain, magic, rare, legendary) or if it also affects the number of magical properties on an item (4, 5, or 6 magical properties specifically). I'm tabulating the properties of the items I find while playing with two different amounts of magic find on my character.

For instance, for gear set #1 I may find that of the items I find 40% have 4 properties, 35% have 5, and 25% have 6. With gear set #2 I may find that 40% have 4 properties, 30% have 5, and 30% have 6. I'd like to compare these two sets of proportions/percentages to know if they are statistically different. I don't know if they should be compared as a set to each other or if I should compare the proportion of 4s to each other, 5s to each other, and 6s to each other.

For the second question, I'm tabulating how many ""rare"" type of items I find per minute depending on which area I'm playing in the game. I'd like to compare finding 1.5 items/minute in one area to 1.3 items/minute in another area and know if they are statistically different or not.

In particular, what if I have an autoregressive model: Zt = f(Zt-1, Zt-2...) + e, how can i get a non-parametric forecast for Zt+1 out of this, given that I estimated f(Zt-1, Zt-2...) using Kernel methods?

Please go easy on me if I've got this totally wrong.  My math/stats background isn't strong, but I'm finding certain aspects of statistics really fascinating, and I really want to learn more.

Let's suppose that:

25% of all internet users have acted like a troll at least once.
20% of people who've acted like trolls have reddit accounts.
40% of people who have reddit accounts have never trolled.

What's the likelihood that someone with a reddit account has also trolled at least once?

Okay, let's assume we have 100 people total.  So 25 of them have trolled, and 75 haven't.  5 of those who have trolled (20% of the 25) also have reddit accounts.  Of the people who haven't trolled, 30 have reddit accounts (40% of 75).

So, the total number of people with reddit accounts is 35 (5 redditors who have trolled + 30 redditors who haven't).  Of those 35, 5 have trolled -- which means that there's approximately a 14% chance (5/35) that any given redditor has trolled at least once.

I run this model on each condition of my between-subject experiment *separately*, and then pipe the results for each one of my many subjects into a (wait for it) independent samples t-test, where the groups are defined by conditions in my experiment.

Unfortunately, it seems that these t-statistics are biased upwards (e.g., relative to running a separate Bayesian model on every subject), because the hierarchical model in effect shrinks the variance observed in each group. This is, of course, one of the desirable features of a hierarchical model - I assume because this shrinkage is accounting for assumed errors in measurement, errors in variables, etc, as opposed to merely imposing an arbitrary shrinkage on your variance.

My question: is this bias in my t-stats (due to decreased variance via shrinkage in the hierarchical model) something I want to avoid, or is it the case that the decreased variance in the point estimates achieved by using a hierarchical model actually does something more like ""correcting for regression to the mean"", in which case the reduced variance is actually desirable?

I've posted to rstats but it's not getting any attention.  I'm reading about the plyr package, but the problem I keep bumping into is that I've got a variable length string.
So, for example, 

I have a field that has comma separated values like:

    Subj     choices                            status
    Sub1    ""John"",""Marty"",""bill"",""sally""        FT

    Subj     choices    status

    Sub3    ”Betty""     PT
    Sub3    ”Trish""     PT  

I can use strsplit to make a list breaking these up but I get stuck there.  strsplit() makes lists within lists, and I don't want to lose the information from the rest of the dataframe.

Is this going to be where I create an index, bust each variable into it's own data.frame, and then merge them back together?

I graduated from undergrad with a bs in pure math and minor in computer science about four years ago. Good GPA (3.9), decent program.

Since then, I have been teaching high school math (geometry, algebra, stat, programming, and calc) because I was not ready to try graduate school and enjoyed tutoring, so I got a job in teaching and I do enjoy it but have wanted to expand my options.

Well, in the past year I've decided I am ready for graduate school. I have deliberated a long time and decided I'd like to go for a masters in statistics rather than math or CS. I am not necessarily aiming for super high ranked programs. I'll probably try at least one, but would mainly aim for mid range programs that offer funding.

I would love any and all advice and opinion on this decision. Some specific questions are:

- How will my time away from college impact my application? I am certain I can get at least two solid letters of rec from college/REU, but am worried that being away from school will hurt my app.

- Should I go for the math GRE? It's not required by anywhere I'm looking at, but I felt doing well on it might help my application. 

- I don't have much coursework in statistics. My decision to study it is based on parts of some courses (scientific programming, numerical analysis, and discrete math) that I particularly liked along with the fact that I have strong interests in research in psychology, biology, and education but feel I could best get into those fields with the stat background rather than the field-specific background. Will my lack of coursework in stat make it really hard to get in?

Any and all advice is much appreciated! Thank you.

The problem is, when I solved P(x&gt;72) using a mean of 70.2 (3.9 times 18), it evaluated to a *greater* probability than what was in the textbook. I would have thought the Law of Large Numbers would imply a smaller probability.

1341340720.0,11,self.statistics,vzoss,"How to interpret a confidence interval, *after* one has seen the data and calculated the interval?",14,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/vzoss/how_to_interpret_a_confidence_interval_after_one/,"I feel a bit queasy when I hear talk of ""frequentist interpretations"" of statistical tests such as the [Confidence Interval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval). Let's me lay out a few non-controversial statements before building up to my specific question.

First, a simple medical example involving a blood test.  If the patient is sick(S), the test result will be positive(+) 95% of the time.  If the patient is healthy(H), the test result will be negative(-) 95% of the time.

    P(+|S) = 0.95
    P(-|H) = 0.95

Everybody is either Healthy or Sick, therefore the test is accurate 95% of the time, no matter whether you are healthy or sick.  This sounds fantastic.

Now, here's the tricky bit: Of all the people that get a positive test result, what proportion of those are sick?  It's tempting to think 95%, because we have a test that is accurate 95% of the time.  But that logic doesn't hold.  Given a positive test result, the conditional probability of being sick could be as little as zero.  Imagine if almost the entire population is healthy - in this case almost all of the positive test results are simply false positives and therefore very few of them are sick.  You would need to have some idea what proportion of your patients are sick (call this a 'prior') in order to calculate probabilities that condition on the data.

So, to summarize, we have a strong statement of accuracy (""accurate 95% of the time"") which is true for all values of the parameter (H or S).  But, when we condition on the data, the statement might not be true at all.  We lose all optimism as soon as we see the data.  We need to make further statements (priors) if we wish to have a basis to calculate conditional probabilities such as P(S|+).

We can replace Healthy and Sick with two conventional hypotheses, such as ""Electrons and positrons have the same mass"" and ""they have different mass"".   A frequentist wouldn't be happy putting a probability on such things, arguing that such things are either true or false and there is nothing random about it. Therefore it becomes more difficult to say, given a particular observed dataset, how reasonable the hypotheses are.  Does *this* data tell us that one hypothesis now looks better than it did?  I find it difficult to get a frequentist to make any such statement from a confidence interval.

We can change the setup further, so that we have a continuous parameter space rather than just a simple discrete space.  But the logic still holds. *Before* we look at the data, we can say ""the probability is at least 95% that the true value of the parameter will be within the interval that we compute.""

The parameter isn't a random variable, in the confidence interval framework, but the experimental data is a random variable.  The distribution of the data, and of the resulting interval, is a random variable whose distribution depends on the parameter.  It is meaningful to make statements, in advance of the experiments, about the probability that the interval will contain the true value of the parameter.

But we can make no such statements *after* we have looked at the data.  Once the data is seen and the confidence interval is calculated, you cannot say that the probability that it is still correct is 95%.  This is like the medical test; we were 95% confident; but now we can't say anything conditioning on the data, unless we are prepared to use priors.

Or can you? Clearly, if you're willing to specify a prior and use a [Credible Interval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval), then you can still make strong statements after conditioning on the data.  But I'm curious about the prior-free frequentist Confidence Interval.  When I hear talk of a ""frequentist interpretation"" I think it just means:  ""I was optimistic before I saw the data, but I am unwilling to make any statement that is based on this data.""

As far as I can see, there is *no* frequentist interpretation of the confidence interval after the data and the interval are gathered and calculated.  They are willing and able to make statements about future experiments, *statements which even the most rabid Bayesian would agree with*, but they simply have ""no comment"" on the just-observed data.

I'm not really too interesting in *justifying* the frequentist interpretation.  We could argue all day about the validity or otherwise of writing down priors on hypotheses and treating hypotheses as random variables.

So, my question is: am I correct in saying that frequentists have no comment to make on the just-observed data and the interval associated with it? And that their statements are strictly related to future/alternative experiments?  That there is no ""frequentist interpretation"" associated with the just-observed data, the frequentist has no comment to make of any kind on that data? After you have calculated the interval, have you learned anything about the parameter that you didn't know before the experiment?  If not, why did you do the experiment?  If so, tell me what you have learned.

Contrast this with the use of p-values.  Given a low p-value, people will say ""either a rare event occured, or the null hypothesis is false."" Such wording is clearly intended to make the reader have 'more doubt' about the null hypothesis than they did before the experiment.  But with confidence intervals, I find it difficult to get anybody to say that they now feel that they have a better idea what the value of the parameter is, specifically that it is within the interval.  As far as I can see, p-values skirt close to being Bayesian - see [this pdf on the opposing and contradictory philosophies between Fisherian p-values and Neyman-Pearson error rates](http://www.uv.es/sestio/TechRep/tr14-03.pdf).

I'm already using a lot of optimization tricks and write critical code in C instead of in R.  Still, R is much too slow for many thing I'm doing.  Recently I became aware of Revolution R which supports multicore and cluster computing.  I might have access to a cluster soon, but I'm mainly interested in multicore support using the foreach package.  My questions:

1. Can I use Revolution R as a drop in replacement for standard R? 

2. Are there any drawbacks or problems?

3. If not, why isn't everybody using it?

4. And in general: what's your experience with Revolution R?

Many thanks!

**Edit:**

I just tried the community version of Revolution R (from official Ubuntu repositories).
Parallelizing my code was trivial using the foreach package.  Now my
script uses both cores of my machine!  As far as I understand, I can run this
code also on a cluster if Revolution R Enterprise is installed there.

Converting the code comes down to replacing for-loops and lapplys by
the foreach construct:

    foreach (i=1:100) %dopar% {
      heavy.lifting(i)
    }

In order to make this parallel you have to register the parallel
computing backend for foreach:

    library(multicore)
    library(doMC)
    library(foreach)

    registerDoMC(2)

The last line initializes to worker processes.  The iterations of a
foreach call are distributed to these workers.  The nice
thing: if you want to run your code in a standard R, you just load the
foreach package without registering a backend.  The iterations of the
loop are then executed sequentially.

I am working at the moment on my master thesis. I am analyzing my data at the moment and I have a lot of trouble to get through it.

I have been told in [that thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/13xlq5/need_help_to_analyse_data_behavioral_biology/) that I should use multinomial logistic regression.

I will just explain here what I have as data (each bullet is a column in my text file):

* date
* time
* ActivityX
* ActivityY
* Temperature
* Behavior
* Valley
* Age
* Month
* Year
* kid
* individual

Where date and time are the value for the day and time when the activity (on x and y axis) were registered. The temperature is the temperature when the activity was registered.

I have made a recursive partitioning to find out for each activity to what behavior it correspond (based on field data I gathered).

The valley is where the individual lived (2 different valleys)

The age corresponds to how old the individual is.

The month is in what month the data was registered. Same for the year.

Kid is a Yes or No variable (if the individual has a kid or not). And the Individual is the number associated to him (the tag on his ear).

By individual I mean alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). All the data (except from the one I gathered on the field) is GPS data.

My goal is to check for correlation between the Behavior (4 different possible: [R]esting, [F]eeding, [M]oving, [R]uning) and the temperature, month, year, age, valley (and maybe later if it has a kid or not), also I want to account for the individual (since they might not all behave the same way all the time).

Now my big problem is that I can't do that on R, I do not have the knowledge and despite my tries I can't get to what I want (plots of correlation and p-value associated).

I hope someone here can help me with that, If it is requested, I can pay (unfortunately not very much since I am still a student). If it is the case PM me so we can talk about it.

(Oh please let there be something simpler)

Basically I have several data sets each with multiple axes and various indices that I neet to plot onto various matrices to visualize to demonstrate similarities.

The last time I took math was in grade 10 and I have never studied stats per se. Please be gentle.

EDIT: Thanks for all your engaging questions, bear with me as I think and figure out how to respond in language that makes sense!

EDIT2:

I have written up [a short description](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1lfGuYl6U_GRnNESXVtYXUwUjA) (ok- it's about 1700 words) of how the theory I'm describing specifically works, I've put key elements in bold. Thanks for your help and patience. 

My vague idea is that there are three axis: subject, power and knowledge. On each matrix, specific relations can be plotted and then by creating several graphs, the transformations and links between relations will become clear at a glance

edit3: looks like there are 4 variables: knowledge, subject, power, time), which I'm not sure if that means 2 graphs or what but either six sets of correlational data or 1 graph with all 4 dimensions/axis/variables super imposed. 

EDIT 4

To the critics of this idea: I just discovered a book considered heretical in my field [*Graphs Maps Trees* by Franco Moretti](http://books.google.ca/books?id=YL2kvMIF8hEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). It was written in 2005 and plots/graphs/visualizes literary history by way of statistical data sets scraped from literature, in the same way I am trying to reverse engineer and visualize Foucault's analytic framework. 

Yes, this is an unorthodox approach for scholarship in the humanaties, but it can be done. I will report back with any successes or failures as this project unfolds- the perspectives offered here have been inspirational, thanks.

EDIT 5:

I'm afraid that something is being lost in translation here. I'm not refusing to share the sources (see below)- the problem is that I don't think reading them will help you help me. 

Foucault's writing is esoteric and dense and requires a considerable amount of background reading to penetrate. Not only that, he develops his framework analysis as he deploys it, and the result is that it isn't presented in his writing in a linear or obviously structured fashion. He deploys and establishes the various mechanisms of relations in practice (by doing actual historical research and analyzing actual primary source texts, like the Bible), while actively conceptualizing and refining and redefining his theory of how to proceed next, as he goes. His framework isn't a like a guide book or a walkthrough, it is developed over the course of his 20+ years of thinking, criticizing the world around him and looking for historical roots and origins of contemporary problems, finding those inaugural notions and then tracing their existence (characterizing  or plotting their relations I believe) in various periods of time, in various cultures, in various societies and in various discourses. 

The end result being a robust framework which reveals powerful, new meanings about our world, that had been previously obscured (intentionally or not) by history, which is itself trapped from public consumption by virtue of it's hidden, confusing and exclusionary (and typically Foucaultian) representation. I want to fix that, I want to help people 'get' what Foucault does and 'get' why its so important and useful, at a glance. 

Now I've done all the background reading and I have written up an analysis of how his analysis works. What I don't have, is an understanding of how to even begin to interpret his framework and translate his ideas into terms that a programming language capable of rendering a visualization of his structural framework would recognize.

&gt; communication in this thread has been a bit problematic, but I think this is mostly due to a clash of vocabularies between different scientific fields, and as such, I have found it quite illuminating.

I had the idea to make this post on a hunch, a wild/onorthodox hunch and what I've realized in all the discussions of this thread is that I was diving into the deep end- and have had to backtrack significantly before I can even begin to ask stats-mined people for advice.

The problem at the most basic level is that of quantity v. quality of data. I need to determine what stats is good at doing, rather than assuming it is useful for my abstract purposes.

I'm wondering this both for fun and, if you guys agree that it's a flawed enough assumption, I might approach the professor. 

Here's what I think is wrong:
The professor assumes that the takers of each unique test have similar average talents. The class has just 37 students, so if the three smartest students took the same test, the average would be skewed and would not represent the difficulty of that test.

Hi all, 

This is my first post to r/statistics. Coming from a EE background, we always hear about this signal being independent of this signal. Algorithms abound that say ""We can do this because signal x1 and signal x2 are independent"".

I have researched this topic but keep getting hit over the head with it. Everything I have read about independence gives me the text book definition but no way of really utilizing it. 

I know that for two random variables to be independent, the product of their marginal PDFs should equal the joint PDF. p(x,y) = p(x)*p(y). I see this everywhere I go, in every wiki, book, and link I have seen. Thats great. Thats fantastic. But frankly I dont see how it helps me 'on the ground'.

So, my questions are as follows: 

1) I have two data vectors. a[n] and b[n]. Each is length N. Lets say N = 1000. Lets say that a[n] measured temperature every day. And lets say that b[n] measured, oh, I dont know, the number of newborns born at some hospital for each day. I know intuitively those two are independent... I have those two vectors... _what do I type into my MATLAB to show they are independent?_ My fingers are on the keyboard with ML open ready to go. 


2) Again I have two data vectors, a[n] and b[n]. But lets say that this time, the two vectors are heavily dependent. Perhaps a[n] measures the temperature everyday, and b[n] (help me out here) might be umm, the temperature squared? I hesitate to use humidity because I want b[n] to be uncorrelated to a[n] but still dependent. If you can think of a better example by all means use it, but the over arching question is, again, given those two vectors, _what do I do to the data here on my computer in code, to show their degree of dependence_.

Thanks in advance everyone, and sorry for my frustration, I am trying to really grasp this idea. Thanks. ",,False,,t5_2qhfi,False,,,True,t3_q16ii,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/q16ii/frustrated_how_can_i_concretely_test_if_two_or/,

I'm studying a statistics and economics double major in Canada (uoft). Just finishing the first semester of my 4th year and my GPA is ass. I'm at a 2.5 right now and it's just going to get worse after this semester for sure. I don't have much of an excuse. My GPA really plummeted because of my 3rd year, I only got 2 A's and the rest were C's and D's. However I will say that I have decent marks in the statistics courses I have taken (alongside the econometrics). My math courses are killing my GPA, alongside the computer science courses which I took (mandatory and hated every bit of it). 

Anyway, this year is looking even worse, and that 2.5 might turn into a 2.3 or worse...

I really want to break into finance, (risk management) particularly, and  after my shoddy undergrad performance, no half decent grad school will even take me for a masters in stats or financial engineering or whatever. I only held one job that is somewhat relevant, doing research for a small firm last summer. 

I am really lost and don't know what to do with my life after I graduate...my GPA is the thing I'm most worried about right now. Sure many people say that job hunting isn't solely GPA dependent, but progressing in life might be. I know that several senior level positions might require a masters of some kind (like an MBA or a masters in math/stats etc. if in risk management). 

It sucks, I only just realized how important a fucking number is in determining your entire life. I wish I could take it all back, but i can't.

TL;DR:

My GPA is shit, not much work experience, have a higher chance of learning how to fly than going to grad school. What in the fuck can I do (if anything)?

I'm a Junior in college, majoring in Biology at my university. I started off with the plan to go into medicine, but after research and shadowing, I'm reconsidering... I've always been fascinated by statistics and have always enjoyed the classes. I took biostatistics a year ago and got a 98% in the class, highest grade overall. I loved that class and it was really easy for me. Because of that I declared a minor in statistics, and so far I've taken a few classes other than biostat, one was a ""computer applications of statistics class"" and the other was the second ""statistical methods"" class. I've used excel, minitab, and SAS. I plan to finish my degree in Biology, but will have taken calcII and linear algebra before I graduate. I'm considering on going to grad school in Statistics or Biostat.

My questions:

- what are the work hours like for the already established statisticians here?
- do you guys still like your jobs? Any regrets about the statistics path you took?
- What types of companies are in most demand for statisticians right now? (like pharmaceuticals, etc.)
- How's the pay after roughly 10 years in the field?
- what else can I do to prepare myself for grad school in stat.
- any other advice you'd like to offer?

It's also obvious that the expected value for the number of rolls of each face is a sixth of the total number of rolls.

Would the most appropriate test be to treat each the number of rolls possible value (i.e. 1 through 6) as separate binomial distributions and check that they're close enough to the expected value, where ""close enough"" is determined by your desired confidence level?

I've enjoyed reading the different educational links and discussions we've had on this subreddit. Our group is certainly diverse, with readers who are working in chemistry, business, and other academic / non-academic contexts. 

A few times, people have come here and tried to ask questions on analysis approaches or graphical representations or other things. These can be frustrating for us because they are full of jargon, shorthands, acronyms and have no clear, defined scientific question.

To start a point of reference, it might be good to outline a general structure for getting a representative quorum of our Reddit trained statisticians (or statistically trained Reddittors :) )

* Make a short, suggestive title. Phrase it in the infinitive so that filler words don't lead to ambiguous language. For instance instead of ""How do you get the difference in survival rates between control group and treatment group assigned tamoxifen"" just say ""Calculating difference in survival between two groups"". The rest can be explained in the body of the submission.

* Give a good solid paragraph of scientific background so that we can understand the problem. Define jargon. Use your Standard Academic Approach to Acronyms [SAAA], SAAA can help keep entries short and clear and teach us something too.

* Ask a clear well defined question. If it's not quantitative, we might bounce a few ideas off of you to get things rolling. If there are several things you want to compare, that's fine, but don't entangle them into a single question because it's just confusing. Different sentences for different ideas.

* Mention any approaches you are trying and why there might be a problem (e.g. the reviewer says they want a non-parametric test).

* Be open to different philosophies. Different people have had different training and backgrounds and will potentially recommend wildly different strategies for each problem.

* Try to use the correct language for your problem. We might have to retool your thinking because a conventional word can mean something completely different in statistics. Frequently, researchers ask how to test if two variables are correlated. By ""correlated"" they often mean something different from statistical correlation, the ratio of covariance to standard deviation of both variables, but want to know if any change in one variable effects a change in another variable.

* If there's a serious statistical precedent in your field, we need to know about it. For instance, in psychology, some scores for certain disorders are almost always analyzed using linear regression. If we didn't know that, we might suggest a proportional odds model or another cumulative link if the number of categories are small. We're obviously not gonna poke around 12-13 articles in the Journal of Psychiatric Research to find this out.

That's all I can think about for now. Sorry if it sounds pompous or absolutist. I'm willing to edit things down based on our consensus here.",,False,,t5_2qhfi,True,,,True,t3_cw8qi,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/cw8qi/suggestion_for_question_submission_guideline_on/,

I’m just now completing my first course in Bayesian statistics, and have really enjoyed it. The Bayesian way of quantifying prior knowledge and uncertainty, and how this plays out over a hierarchical model structure is, to me, pretty intuitive (not to mention interesting and useful). I can’t decide how I feel about the likelihood principle, however. 

Obviously, intuition is a poor way to choose statistical methodologies, but I feel the need to reconcile my otherwise frequentist education (especially what I’ve learned about experimental design), which seems to violate the likelihood principle fairly regularly, with more intuitive Bayesian Statistics. Wikipedia has been very helpful, but hasn’t satisfied me. 

My questions are as follows:

1. How do statisticians that regard frequentist and Bayesian methods both as useful tools think about the Likelihood Principle?


2. Is the Likelihood Principle strongly supported or rejected by any reddisticians?

3. In terms of stopping rules, are there any good simulation studies to examine the existence of bias introduced as a result (particularly in clinical trials work)?

Any insight you all have would really be appreciated.

If it helps, I'm from Europe. A year ago I graduated with a ba in psychology. GPA was 3.7, which could have been a little higher but I screwed up a bit during my last year. 


Not knowing what to do, I took a year off and ended up in a dead end retail job where I declined a promotion and pan on quitting within a few weeks. 


Originally, I planned on going on to study either neuroscience or cognitive psych but I'm somewhat glad I did not. I would prefer industry work over academics.


I did apply to some schools and got an offer for a MSc in Statistics. I was excited at first but my tendency to over think things is hindering my ability to make a decision. 


My main problem is that I'm not fully sure what I may be getting myself into. The people I know in real life barely know anything about the field and most equate it to accounting (because you deal with numbers, I guess?)


During my undergraduate education I only took 3 statistics courses: research statistics (intro to stats), methods of social research and  methods of psychological assessment. I also had to do some self learning for my thesis. All of which, while challenging, I thoroughly enjoyed. Survey design might have been the least enjoyable - researching, analyzing results and presenting on what, how and why I did not mind, I actually enjoyed it, but administering the surveys... oh god, never again.


During the year off I've been dabbling with programming on my free time.  Learned some C, currently learning python on Coursera  and finished Andrew Ng's machine learning course the last time it was offered. I also just started reading up on some math again (not my strongest side, I failed my high school exam, but surprisingly self learning it is enjoyable and not at all frustrating, albeit slower than in a formal setting)


What I'm trying to say is that I'm not sure what it is like studying statistics. I'm sure it's unlike  any intro to stats I've taken. I don't feel like I've been exposed enough to the field to have a burning desire to jump right in, yet strangely I find it appealing. If it helps, I'd like to steer away from social sciences and preferably work within the tech industry.


This turned out longer that I expected. Apologies if I rambled too much. Do ask questions if needed and any advice/insight will be appreciated.


tl;dr: ba in psychology, gap year in a retail job, got an offer for msc in statistics, unsure what to do.

Some time ago I followed a statistics course and one thing has been nagging me... I hope some of you can help me understand.

Consider the following setup: you take measurements from two devices D1 and D2 that are of the same make and type (e.g. thermometers that are very close together).

Suppose we want to check is both thermometers are behaving the same. One could be an expensive calibrated device, and the other could be a cheap alternative, for example.

If I understand correctly, the standard way of handling this is to set a null hypothesis that the measurement sample distributions are identical, and then proceed to process the actual samples from both devices and obtain some statistical measure from it; and then see if the value thus obtained is particularly improbable (is below a previously decided threshold), given the null hypothesis of the devices having the same distribution. If it is below the threshold, the null hypothesis will be rejected.

Now here's my beef with this: it is a priori completely obvious that there will be *some* difference in the two devices, since they are physically different artifacts. The magnitude of the difference may be exceedingly small, but it will in reality *never* be zero, and by taking enough measurements we will in principle have to reject the null *always*, at *any* level of significance. The only reason why we would not do that is because we haven't collected enough samples.

So my question is this: Is the setup above a statistically valid method of approaching the question posed? If so, I feel that is very strange, since assuming a thing that you know *a priori* to be false appears quite unhelpful. From an assumption of untruth, anything follows.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Basically, there are two groups (G1 and G2) with outcome Y:

 * G1 generally has a higher intercept, but lower growth rates
 * G2 generally has lower intercept, but higher growth rates
 * Growth and intercept are negatively correlated across the entire dataset (lower intercepts have higher growth rates)

So, I run a regression of group's effect on slope and intercept. G2 has a negative effect on intercept, but a positive effect on slope (not surprising). My question is about the positive effect on slope - does this take into account the correlation between intercept and slope? Specifically, if I had two hypothetical individuals, one from each group, with the same initial value, would I expect the one in G2 to grow faster?

If the model does not take this into account, is there anyway to model baseline/slope interactions? I could calculate the intercept seprately for each individual, and include it as a term in the regression. I'm using nlme in R, so this would mean going from:

    lme(Q~Time*G2, data=data, random= ~Time | ID, na.action=""na.omit"")

(G2 is a dummy, with 0= G1, 1,=G2) to

I'm working on modelling residential segregation by income using spatial error models, from the spatial econometrics field.  I have a vector of covariates -- 29 in total -- and a vector of variables that are of interest to my research question (11 in total).  I'm facing a considerable amount of model uncertainty with respect to which covariates to include from among the many, many candidate models, and with respect to the choice of [spatial weight matrices](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese502/lab-content/extra_materials/SPATIAL%20WEIGHT%20MATRICES.pdf). 

I've read about Bayesian Model Averaging as a solution to this kind of model uncertainty, but I'm afraid that I'm a bit in over my head in regards to how to implement it, and what each piece of the mechanics of it means.

Could anyone explain it to me like I'm ... 20? You know, reasonably intelligent, numerate, literate, etc. ... but not a 'hard-core stats person', not a statistician per se, and not someone who could off the top of his head rattle off a detailed explanation of the difference between Bayesianism and Frequentism?

There are packages available for BMA in R - ""bma"" and ""bms"" at least -- but these are apparently for bayesian model averaging of linear models, glm, logit, probit, etc., and I don't think they would apply to the study of a set of spatial error candidate models.

A few papers describe the application of BMA to spatial econometric models, but they, too, go over my head to one extent or another -- 
""Bayesian Model Averaging for Spatial Econometric Models"" (2007), by LeSage and Parent, and
[""Methodology for Bayesian Model Averaging: An Update"" by Hoeting](http://www.stat.colostate.edu/~nsu/starmap/jah.ibcbma.pdf)

So I decided to switch majors from Molecular Biology to Statistics last semester, which was the second semester of my freshman year.  The Statistics major at my university is only 50 credits though (out of 120 needed to graduate), and I figure it would be good to have a minor that would work well with it.

Currently debating between math and computer science.  I figure with math, it gives me more leverage for grad school and understanding how various inference methods work.  Additionally, linear algebra is a requirement for the statistics major and can be fulfilled with either an applied or a theoretical course so for the 15-credit minor, I'd be making up a class for my major and two classes for the minor (linear algebra and theoretical math).

On the other hand, computer science and programming knowledge are pretty much necessary to do any kind of professional work with statistics and happens to be much more practical.  It's a 16-credit minor and nothing crosses over.

I also did the math, and I have 24 credits completed already (in addition to a bunch of AP credits and another 4 from Calc 2 at the end of the semester), putting me at another 96 credits to go before I can graduate.  Calc 1, 2, and 3 are necessary for my major, so I will have 12 (other four from my Intro Stat class) from my major already completed by the fall (38 major credits left).

Since I have some leeway, I have a few options.  I can minor in math or CS, minor in both, or add CS as a second major (40 credits) because some of the math classes cross over.  I'd love to have a versatile skillset.

Any advice r/statistics?

I know the total number of marbles in the urn, but do not know how many black or white's are in it. I assume that there are n or more black marbles in the urn. What I want to do is randomly and repeatedly take one marble out of the urn, determine it's color (which is a costly operation), and then determine how probable it is that my assumption could still be correct. So I take out one marble (and don't put it back), look at it's color, and each time I do this I calculate how probable it is that there were n or more black marbles in the urn.

I am confused about how to correctly characterize a physical system. Let's say we have request entities and service entities arriving at two arrival rates: request arrival rate \lambda_r and a service arrival rate \lambda_s. Let's say both enter into their own separate queues. Request entities are serviced only when there are both request entities and service entities in their queues. So service rate would refer to the rate at which request entities are serviced by service entities.  

For example, consider a queue of particles and a queue of anti-particles. So long as there are both particles and anti-particles in the queue, they will join together one by one and annihilate. The service rate would refer to the rate at which particles and anti-particles collide and annihilate. Both arrive at different arrival rates, so at any time there may be a build-up or particles or a build-up of anti-particles. So the service rate at a particular time depends on both arrival rates and on the initial conditions (size of the queues).  

How can I characterize such a system? Which queueing model should I use? Moreover, consider that the arrival rates might be changing with time; or alternatively, that the rates are constant but that arbitrary initial conditions can be specified.

I am trying to simulate, based on historical transactions, what the optimal position size should be. As statistics novice (or less) I am finding this difficult, so please advise further and correct my statements where necessary.

Monte carlo simulation (MCS) goes through different samples within the population of data with different sizes in many iterations to essentially randomise the data and give the likelihood of the balance of my account (in this case).

So, for example, if I have 10 historical trades. MCS picks randomly any number of trades in random order to see the effect on my balance. To go through one trial, it picks 3 out of 10 trades in random order and using the pre-specified position size parameter MCS will say using those 3 trades as a guide your account is up 1 %. And it goes through many iterations to see the impact on my account when the bets are placed where I determine the fixed bet size.

This is obviously more fairer than just calculating what happens to account balance when all 10 historical trades are made sequentially with fixed position size because MCS doesn't assume the order of historical transactions to repeat exactly as the data in the future.

What I am trying to do is simplify this process by using just set of key information from the historical transactions detail. If I have 10 trades, say, 7 are wins and 3 are losses while the size of wins and losses will vary. But I can figure out the average of wins and losses and their standard deviations.  (obviously this becomes more efficient to system and also less time consuming if I have 10000 historical trades)

So rather than letting the MCS run different iterations with actual data I can simply use random function to specify how many within the sequence should be picked and determine whether each trade is a win or a loss based on the win probability already known and randomly determine the win or loss size based on the standard deviation around the mean. 

And if i specified.. 2% risk per trade it will go through the simulation to see what happens to my account balance. After, say, 1000 simulations, will it simply find the average of all results ?

Thanks for reading this much.

I am desperately trying to learn.. so please help clarify my understanding.

Thanks.

Maybe you guys can help?",12,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/op3ym/im_not_statistical_but_i_have_been_wondering_on_a/,"Let's set up a thought experiment.  Say I have a bag of ping-pong balls, 999 are white and 1 is black.  Let's say I draw a ball from the bag at random, note it's color, and put it back.  I understand that the probability of pulling a black ball is 1 in 1000, and is that same probability for each pull because the ball goes back in.

Let's say a person were to pull balls from the bag (always returning the ball after each pull) until they pulled a black ball, and they noted how many pulls it took. Let's say they did this 100,000 times and noted how many times each number of pulls was needed to pull the black ball. (For instance, the black ball appeared on the 43rd pull 100 times out of the 100,000 tests.)

If one were to graph these results, with the number of pulls required to  find the black ball on the X axis and the number of tests out of 100,000 where it took that many pulls on the Y axis, what would the shape of the graph be?

To my mind, it would be a parabola, with a maximum somewhere between 1 and infinity.  I think this because I would imagine that the probability of pulling the black ball after only a few pulls would be fairly low, but increasing with the number of balls pulled.  I would imagine that the probability of pulling 3000 times without finding the black ball would also be fairly low, so I don't imagine that the function would be linearly increasing, either.

I once wrote a program (I'm working on a masters in computer science) to brute-force this problem (not using statistical methods, but counting random-number generation), and the graph that I got had it's highest point at x=1 and y=probability of pulling the black ball on first pull.  Then the graph dropped toward zero exponentially.  I don't really understand this result, but I'm fairly sure that my program accurately modeled the ball-pulling problem.

Is there is a way to make an unbiased decision that does not assume that a coin is fair? Lets say P(H) = p and P(T) = q , p+q = 1 and p,q need not be 0.5. The objective is to pick a winner between team A and team B with equal probability.

One solution I came up with was to toss the coins twice. The possible out comes and their probabilities would be  
HH = pp  
HT = pq  
TH = qp  
TT = qq  

Now if we define a process where two coins are tossed and if the first is head and second is tail team A wins (HT) and if the first is tail and second is head team B wins (TH). If the head or tail repeats (HH or TT) we discard the toss and toss again. This will of course be very inefficient since we will be on average doing 4 tosses to make 1 decision (this depends on p,q), but the decision is then independent of the distribution from which the toss comes. 

To take it further you can draw a random sample from any distribution and use any arbitrary cutoff to define head or tail and still be able to use this approach to make a fair decision.

What do you guys think of this, you think we should use this to decide which team should bat first or computer simulations which are very sensitive to biases. Is there a more efficient way to do this?

I have a categorical dependent variable and a categorical independent variable. I have experience with conducting a Chi-Squared test and checking to see if there is a significant non-independence result. I also have experience with checking if the absolute value of the standardised residual is greater than 2 for any individual value (which would show that it is driving the non-independence result). However, I have found something that I would like to do, and that is NOT one of the above. 

I would like to compare two different proportions within the Chi Squared analysis (or if anyone can think of another test, that is fine!). For example, in my basic analysis I have a table with 'region' (Scotland, England etc) along the side and 'stream type' (either 1,2 or 3) along the top. In this table I have the proportions calculated along the rows (so 1,2 and 3 add up to 100 percent). I would like to compare (Scotland,2) to (England,2). These proportions differ, 38% to 29% respectively and I would like to know if the difference is significant.

I don't need help solving it, I just can't wrap my head around the result... So it goes like this:

There's a 0.005 probability that someone has cancer of a given type.

There's a test for it and, given the event ""+"" for positive test and the event ""C"" for someone having cancer:

P(+|C) = 0.99 and P(not+|notC) = 0.95. I'm supposed to calculate P(C|+) (which is 0.0905. Solution:)

    P(C|+) = P(C and +)/P(+) = P(+|C)P(C)/P(+)
    P(+) = P(+|C)P(C) + P(P|notC)P(notC) = 0.0547
    =&gt; P(C|+) = 0.0905

    The result given in the solutions of the exercise is the same as the one I get.

Which means that even though the test has a 99% chance of finding cancer if there is cancer to be found, and only 5% chance of ""finding"" cancer where there is none, there is only ~9% chance of your having cancer if the test is positive.
