1357861841.0,150,self.INTP,16cgdi,A 10-rule guide for interacting with INTP's that I wrote a few years ago,166,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/16cgdi/a_10rule_guide_for_interacting_with_intps_that_i/,"This was on a blog that I stopped writing a long time ago, but I thought you guys might like to read it. Also, I'm quite interested in your opinions about what I wrote. Reading it now, after a few years, I think I would approach a few subjects differently but I posted it as it was originally. 

1. Just because they didn't hear you doesn't mean they aren't interested. We daydream a lot, and may be a bit sluggish to return to reality in time to catch what you said.
2. Don't force them to share their feelings. For introverts, personal thoughts and feelings are our property until we decide otherwise. This doesn't mean that we don't have feelings, just that they are a privilege for the hand-selected. Violating this is often deeply troubling. On the other hand, feel flattered if they decide to share with you.
3. Don't say they are over-analyzing or ""thinking too much"". We are not over-analyzing. You are under-analyzing. We are by nature very analytical and critical. This is how we understand the world, and the opinion that our conclusions are strange or wrong because we've put too much thought into them is often quite frustrating.
4. Do back up your rules with logic. While INTP's can have problems with authority, it is usually unsubstantiated authority that really gets under our skin. If we see a logical or practical need for a rule, we'll almost always abide by it. It is when we must obey authority for authority's sake that we so often go rogue. Without evidence that a rule is necessary we are much more likely to disregard it. Parents, this may mean taking the time to explain your rationale in detail. Our weak point is logic. Back up your rules with evidence and explanations instead of ""Because I said so"" if you want them respected.
5. Don't expect them to do anything the conventional way. We will almost always test the rules and boundaries of the method, whether it is how to bake a cake, how to write a paper or how to dress in the morning. I know my parents grew tired of this even when I was a small child. I was always hearing ""Why do you always have to try things your own way?"" and (mostly in exasperation) ""You always have to try to think of something better!"". While it is prudent to correct us if we're about to hurt something, sometimes it's better to just let us go (you never know, we might actually find a better way).
6. Don't push them too far. While we are generally amiable, flexible and easy-going we are prone to ""snap"" if we are pushed too far or one of our core values is violated. This often blindsides those who do the offending. We hate it too because we are uncomfortable when our actions are guided by feelings alone. If you do end up on the wrong side of the line, a simple unadorned apology will often go a long way.
7. Don't get offended by debate. We love to debate and discuss, but hate to argue. Debating is about idea swapping, testing and generation. Argument involves hurt feelings or personal disagreements. We generally have no trouble separating the two, but often offend those who are more sensitive. We really don't mean to! In fact by debating or playing devil's advocate to your ideas we are often testing their soundness because we are impressed by (or at least curious about) them. If we thought they were crap we probably wouldn't bother. If you feel somewhat assaulted, but they are still acting hunky-dorey, chances are they didn't mean anything by it.
8. Don't expect them to blend in. We are often unconventional, have a tendency towards social rebellion and often place a low priority on popularity or normalcy. This is not a hard and fast rule, but if your INTP stands out from the crowd, you should know that they probably don't care. Remember Einstein's crazy hair?
9. Do give them something complicated to do. We thrive on complexity, theory and possibility. Repetitive work is torturous, but get us started on something with a little more depth and we'll often work obsessively until we are satisfied with the end result. Employers might keep this in mind for that new project that may require some innovation. Parents, keep in mind that while your lil possibly INTP may have average grades in school, they may very well be exceptionally gifted when given the opportunity to work ""outside the box"" on something they are interested in.
10. Don't mistake fair for cold-hearted. If you ever find yourself under the authority of an INTP, don't expect to make much headway with an emotional plea. It isn't that we don't have sympathy, it is that we want to be fair to everyone else. We will often ignore an emotional argument if the outcome will affect the overall justice of the system. The exception to this is if we are supposed to be upholding a rule we don't find necessary (see above). If you really want to get something by an INTP tell them a few good, solid reasons why you need or deserve it rather than try to make them feel sympathy, empathy or guilt.

I liked my small circle of friends, but we were all introverted outcasts of one kind or another.  I never had any clue how to get attention from the opposite sex.  I did well in school, but that only seemed to make my other problems worse.

Bit by bit I learned to find my way through the life situations that many of my peers seemed to know instinctively how to navigate.  It was mostly just a matter of using my auxiliary extraverted intuition to pay attention.  The cues and instructions had always been all around me, but I had thought it was beneath me to play the games I saw others playing.  I finally realized that I was never going to get the things I wanted out of life (companionship, success) unless I at least learned the rules.

The other thing I started doing was using my inferior extraverted feeling function to express myself, but just enough to stand out a little.  In my case, I grew my hair out long.  That was enough to serve as a signal to other people that I was not afraid to be different, but in socially acceptable ways.

I don't know if I can say for sure that it was because of things like that, but by the time I was in my mid-twenties I had a good job, a steady girlfriend (to whom I've now been married 7 years), and I was (and continue to be) much happier than I ever was while in school.

I recognize that it is interesting that we've a lot in common and understandable to want to investigate our similarities further, but it's problematic to think of yourself primarily in terms of your INTP-dom.  Taking an aspect of your personality and projecting it onto your personality ""type"" is doing just that.  

You're scared of the dark?  Don't ask if ""we"" are afraid of the dark -- I'm quite sure you are.  Instead, think about the origins of that fear.  Question it.  Maybe you had a particularly scary childhood, or perhaps you come to the conclusion that it's the unknown you fear; there's always a possibility, too, that its inception is too complicated to analyze.  In any case, casting a net into the INTP community in a delusional quest for confirmation won't tell you much.  If a lot of people share your fear, this similarity might be related to the others.  Nothing more.

1. Social Phase - Basically I want to be around people, have someone to talk to, and a few friends around that I can joke with and play music, video games or board games with. Lasts 2-3 weeks. *Can be caused by an extended Structured Phase.*

2. Go-with-the-flow Phase - Exactly how it sounds. Not really looking for anything in particular, but willing to go along with most plans, as long as they don't irritate me too much. Different from the Social Phase in that I'm not actively seeking social activities. Lasts a week or two. *Can be triggered by an extended Private Phase.*

3. Private Phase - The complete opposite of the Social Phase. I don't want to see anyone, be seen by anyone, or talk to anyone. I'd be perfectly happy locked in a room with food, water, and my computer (with Internet connection). Lasts 2-3 weeks, rarely any longer. *Can be triggered by intense emotional turmoil. (when caused by emotional turmoil, it can last up to a month) Can also be caused by extended Social Phase*

4. Structured Phase - The opposite of the Go-with-the-flow Phase. Everything is planned out, scheduled, and completed like a checklist. Some things are missed (because INTP), but for the most part, I am pretty productive during this time.  Lasts up to a week. *Can be caused by an extended Go-with-the-flow Phase.*

I guess I'm interested in knowing whether anyone else here follows a similar pattern of behaviour. It's something I've only recently put more than idle thought into.

It's not even that you're mildly interested - you seem intensely fascinated with how things work that you make the person you're talking to feel amazing, like a professor imparting crucial knowledge. You make the people around you feel like their interests are justified, and not only justified but deeply valued.

Our intent is to keep the subreddit clean and vanilla.  No clutter.  Any recommendations regarding how we can better /r/INTP are welcome both in this post's comments, or by messaging the moderators at any point in the future.

Every single post that has been caught by the spam filter has not been spam.  If after a few minutes your post fails to appear in *new*, message the moderators to have it approved.

* I have now added to the subreddit flair corresponding with each type.  Additionally, users can choose to create their own custom flair (i.e., ""INTP's Wife"").

* I have also added a rather stoic snoo as our header logo.

* My next project is to put together a good sidebar description with INTP descriptions, commentary, and MBTI/JCF resources, giving new readers an all-encompassing introduction to the the INTP type and Jungian Cognitive Functions.

If you've already found friends you fit in really close with and that understand your quirkiness, you're very lucky people and I hope you cherish them with your life.

To the rest of us, sometimes we'll feel totally alone. We feel like we stick out like a sore thumb. What I do in those times is rather than pointing a finger of blame ""Oh it's because they're different"", ""I'm too smart for them"", ""Meh I wouldn't enjoy their company anyway"", in those situations we should admit to ourselves we're upset, humble ourselves, and I promise you'll be happier for it. In other words. I know some times its easy to reach for the nearest negative thought but **please stay positive**.

Life is uneven. For us INTPs we struggle more than most of the other personality types to get past that barrier of entry. A struggle which isn't very visible to others. Being excitable is something we're generally not, fake it if you have to but **please smile** whenever you can. 

I know some times we all feel like we're off in La-La Land with our ambivalent thoughts, and often we'll face a sense of cognitive dissonance when we admit to ourselves we want to spend time with the people shutting us out but our negativity tells us another. The next tip, **please try not to dwell**. Give yourself a small time out maybe once a week, or even one day a week if you need it to get all the negativity out alone, and then remember all the good things in your life, and if you can't, look harder.

There are many more things I would like to say but that's the main brunt of things. Life isn't easy, and you don't necessarily have to be as social as other people expect but life is much easier with a flexible network of friends, I should know, I've spent more than enough time without one.

I know it's hard but:

- Please smile

The other day I used someones name, directly, talking to them.  I realized that I absolutely hate it.  Using peoples names when speaking to them, or even when they are nearby feels so weird.

I almost exclusively use pronouns or titles and these are fine.  Using their name feels too personal or something.  I feel like it's always very obvious that I am speaking to a person so using their name seems redundant as well.

As I reflect on this, I realize it very well may be the case that this is simply a personal quirk.  However, I thought I would check in with everyone here and see if others have a similar situation.

Thank you all for your time!

EDIT:  What we have learned:  Most everyone hates using names.  It seems that it is somehow too personal.  Those who love to use peoples names, cite the same reason for using them in that names are personal things and can bring people closer together or to simply make someone feel good.

It's still up in the air if this is an Introverted thing or even applicable to MBTI.  I will try to make a similar thread on the broader AskReddit later on today if someone else hasn't done so already.  I suspect most people feel this way.

I also think it's coming down to your stance on this, or where you come from when you use a name.  We all agree it's a personal and important thing.  Is it so personal that you don't like to use it or is it so personal that you have to use it?  That's the question I think.  And it's going to come down to your own feelings on it...which might bring in MBTI.

I consider myself a success in this area, and I thought that sharing might help.

I’m happily married with a child, but more than that, I have a relationship that people have often commented positively about.  Outsiders see my wife and I as deeply in love, deeply committed, and deeply happy.      

I met my wife when we were nine years old, but I didn't get to know her until later in highschool.  Dating, for me, was always about finding a partner for my life.  I'd broken up with my previous girlfriend the moment I decided that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with her.  Logically, I didn't see the point in continuing a relationship for the sake of physical gratification, when it meant giving up further opportunities to find a good match. When my wife and I started dating, it was very different.  

First things first, my wife is a very intelligent woman - we had always competed for top grades with each other and she usually won.  While I liked the the mental stimulation she provided, I had never been physically attracted to her until, for a school dress up day, she wore a tight dress.  I then saw that she had and has a incredible body, but had hid it out of modesty.  Until that moment I had seen her as a mousey, geeky kind of person, and this brings me to life lessons number one, two, and three in rapid succession:  

1)  Looks matter, but only to the extent that an initial physical attraction can be created.  As an INTP I liked to think that looks didn't matter, but we are biological, and I think it's silly to attempt to fight that.  

2) Dress for success, as trite as that may  sound.  My wife's attire had hidden her beauty for years, and I, as a human with all our quirky brain wiring, had missed it because of this.  While, I later learned, my own fashion sense (I was a alt-rock dandy at the time) had caught her attention some time before I noticed her.  I've read that INTP's can either be nearly obsessive about their appearance, or completely disregard it as immaterial.  I vacillate between the two, but I strongly suggest the former for work / dating encounters - research the halo effect if you doubt its value.  

3) Smart women get better looking with age, and when seeking a life partner to age with, this is important.  I make this statement confidently based on personal experience, observation, and cultural stereotypes.  Personal experience?  We've been together for nearly fifteen years, and I think it would flatter her to know that she's hotter now than at 17.  I've seen this effect with other women of my cohort, as well as in other aspects of my life.  Many of the hot ditzes from highschool have since put on a lot of weight, or are still trying to cling to youth in a unseemly way.  Cultural stereotypes are often drawn on real patterns, so ask yourself who is more attractive as a stereotype: the bronzed 50-something gold digger type, or the sophisticated 50-something foreign ambassador type?  I’ve developed a theory about why this is.  I find that, as I age, staying fit is more of an intellectual exercise than physical one - there is a huge amount of bad fitness advice out there which a person must sift through.  Also, taste shows in your grooming and fashion choices, and taste is a function of intellect.  (Disclaimer for the female readers, I don't know if this is true for both genders, but I believe it is.  Compare the stereotypes of buff 20-something construction worker vs. 50-something construction worker with a beer belly and a cigar, to a geeky 20-something bio-student with tape on his glasses to 50-something doctor or professor.)

When our relationship began, the love hormones created a strong bond between us and I encouraged this within myself.  I don't see a point in fighting the urge to “rush in” once you've decided this person is a good match.  Our modern caution about emotional connections in romantic relationships is dangerous in this way, as these chemicals are useful in creating the foundation of a strong relationship.  I proposed marriage very quickly, though because of our age, we waited to announce it.  When we went to university we lived together as man and wife for a year (a sensible tradition called hand-fasting) and then married.  

Now for some relationship advice drawn strictly from personal experience.  

1) Combine all your finances, then never think about it again.  Throughout our relationship, I have supported her financially at times, and likewise she has supported me.  There isn’t, nor has there ever been, any my money vs. her money.  Spending decisions are made together and it is never a battle between us.  This allows me to bring logic to the decisions before the fact rather than having to bring it to the fight after.  

2) Your partner will not properly hear you.  As an INTP I pick my words very carefully and strive to say only what I mean and exactly what I mean.  My wife’s emotions sometimes seem directly connected to her ears and create a massive distortion field around what I say.  Don’t take this personally, just calmly clarify and remind your partner how careful you are about what you say, and that all people, including yourself can mis-hear a statement.  Explain how the misunderstanding made you feel - this is hard for me, but it’s better than arguing about who said what.  

3) Do nice things for your partner, and make it clear this is how you’re showing them your love - by thinking about them.  Feelings are tough for us, but I find they really help.  As a extra tip, buy emergency gifts.  I always have one or two items hidden away, not for when I’m in trouble - never try to buy your way out of a conflict - but for those moments when I want to do something nice, but I can’t or don’t want to go out.  As long as these items are purchased or made from genuine affection, I don’t think it’s disingenuous to hold them in reserve.  

4) Sex, for me anyway, is not driven as much by intellectual emotions, but by base physical desires.  Everyone has these desires, and it’s much more satisfying to have them serviced by someone else.  More emotional people, I think, build sex up into something more than this - which isn’t a problem.  Be there for your partner and don’t treat it as a mercenary act.  Have fun, make it fun.  Logically, it needs to be done, so why not make it as enjoyable as possible.  

5)  Find an emotional release.  We like to think we don’t have emotions, but we do - we’re just not practiced at dealing with them, and this means they can display themselves in negative ways when they finally do surface.  I try to ensure that my releases are time limited - like with exercise - as I’ve found that these releases can easily become escapes if they are allowed to go on too long - as with gaming.  

6) Communicate.  Communicate a lot.  You’ll often be able to guess what your partner is thinking, but don’t assume you’re right.  Ask politely, then deal with any issue.  Many conversations go something like this:  Me:  “Honey, is something bothering you?”  Her:  “Maybe, I don’t know.”  Me:  “Were you hurt by what your mother said?”  Then she gives me a look that asks: How do I always know?  This also shows how much you care to have noticed.

Finally, how to make a relationship last?  People grow and change.  Make sure you grow and change together.  Take an interest in their interests, you don’t have to join them, but learn a bit of the jargon so you can talk about it - I find that once I’ve done this, I start to become really interested.  There is literally nothing in this world that I can’t find interesting when approached in the right way - and voila! we’ve grown together.  This quickly becomes reciprocal as they develop interests in your interests.

My wife, having checked this before I post, is insisting that I justify the post by saying “when you’re happy in love, you want others to be happy in love too.”

I guess I should give you some backstory.  I've never been a great student.  I think in my younger years because of social and familial pressure I was heavily involved in sports and my sense of identity and self esteem became heavily attached to being an athlete.  But I think this hindered me more than anything.  I am naturally an introverted and cerebral person but I was able to blend in among jocks and stoners etc. in high school.  I was always able to pull off straights B's without ever doing homework just by paying attention in class and being a good test-taker.  

This carried over into university where I studied political science and avoided taking courses with major essays etc.  I had A's in 1st year then each semester after I became increasingly bored with my studies and began to almost skirt disaster by seeing how well I could do while completing as minimal work as possible.  Being forced to take courses with major essay components resulted in massive stress and anxiety for me and i started failing because the procrastination became debilitating and I became depressed about  how poorly I was doing and the money I was wasting. 

I realize how incredibly immature my procrastination and attitude towards school was.  I guess it was a holdover from my earlier school experiences where homework was just some arbritrary task forced on me by some authority that only served the purpose of occupying my mind when I would rather be exploring more interesting and stimulating intellectual pursuits.  

Eventually I dropped out of university and worked several dead-end jobs for a couple years. But in those years  I read like a fiend and delved into all sorts of subjects I wanted to know more about.  I took classes in creative writing to get over my fear of writing.  Ideas and art stimulate me.  I want to succeed and have a respectable career.  But not having a university degree has felt like this unfinished burden on my back and is preventing me from any kind of job that involves some of my intellectual interests(psychology, cognitive science, writing). 

So now I find myself at 30, in a new city, attending a community college, trying to take some courses to improve my gpa so I can transfer to a university, and finally finish my degree.  I'm really in a bind financially in terms of whether I can even get a loan for the next couple years.  

Before I enrolled at the college I was super motivated and excited to be studying something I'm interested in and be on a path to finishing my education.  However, I find myself now falling into old traps of anxiety and procrastination.  I know how silly it is, but the uphill battle of being a mature student and the financial strain are  mounting and I'm starting to question my motives again.   A part of me thinks I should just get some kind of mindless trade or skill so I can make money and live the middle-class lifestyle.  But another part of me knows that will be unfulfilling eventually and I'll be back where I started.

Sorry for the depressing and long sob-story but I feel like I'm in a rut and painted myself into a corner in life.  I can't really relate my story to friends and family.  Life seems so much simpler to other people.  Any advice from fellow INTPs would be extremely helpful.

The youngest are in their teens (we have classes for future students) and the oldest are well into their 70s. I am shocked at how fundamentally different we are at different ages. The teen INTPs are to be honest awkward and socially not well adapted. It seems like many of them go through a transformation in their 20s and become a lot more social and cool. 

The most amazing ones are the very old INTPs. Some of them have very well developed Fe and often they seem like super logical ENFJs. From my observation INTPs seem to get very warm with age. 

I am also struck by how late many of the INTPs are. Many of us seem to be years behind their peers when it comes to social development but seem to catch sometime in their 20s. For example many INTPs regularly go to parties but they only started doing so many years after their peers started to go to parties. Another example is dating. Many of the INTPs I meet have a relationship and are able to date attractive mates but many seem to have lost their virginity when they where older than their peers and also where older than others when they started dating.

It seems like INTPs develop just as much socially as everyone else but do it at a greatly reduced speed Also INTPs change more than other types. It seems like the difference between a 18 year old INTP and a 30 year old INTP is greater than it would be for many other personality types.

I used to be into Lucid dreaming and meditation back when my schedule wasn´t so filled with deadlines and homework.  I enjoyed exploring my dreams and thinking about what actually happens while I dream.  Also I play music, and have always found the experience of creative flow to be rather mystical, feeling connected with the moment and such.

So, I was wondering if you guys experience this also or have any advice on how to deal with this:

I've always been an introvert. When I was 16, (now a 22/F)  I got a job at a large coffee chain and worked register. I was AMAZINGLY good at building rapport with people and I really loved the job. From then on, I started to realize that in situations where the conversation is ""controlled"" aka we both have a purpose in talking to each other apart from just... talking, I excelled. This has proven true in other aspects of my life: in classes during college, in other jobs, etc...

However, I get EXTREME social anxiety about going to bars/parties or other situations where conversations are open. I have no idea what to talk to people about!! The only thing that helped was alcohol, but I've completely cut that out for medical reasons. Now, going to a bar sober is my personal HELL. 

This also plays out in other daily situations. For example, when I have to talk to coworkers about something, I am very very good. However, when they come by my cube to chat, I have no idea what to say and it feels awkward.

Oftentimes, when I am trying to talk/debate/make pithy comment/whatever, I can envisage the various associations that comes with that particular concept, and I know exactly what I want to say, but cannot **verbalize** it. At least, not without time and thought, by which time the tides of conversation has probably more or less moved on. 

It's incredibly frustrating. 

I have a feeling it may be a result of the way I think; with images, concepts, emotions ~~yes yes harrharr this INTP has emotion~~ rather than having an internal monologue. Perhaps this blocks whatever cortex it is that controls instantaneous verbal remembrance and recollection. Or maybe I'm just really fucking slow and possibly dimwitted.

After getting our results she hands out a sheet discribing all the differant types.  As she does this she is asking ""How many people got XXXX?"" and was talking about what each meant.  

I was fully absorbed in reading my description, it was so acurate! I hear the prof ask for any INTPs and without looking up, my hand shoots into the air.  I start to raise my head and as my eyes scan the room I notice that everyone is looking at me.  I am the only one in the room of about 30-40 kids with my hand up.  All of a sudden i felt extrememly selfconcious.  What had I just admitted to being?  Why was I the only one, that just doesn't make sense.  I was immobilized with questions/doubts/thoughts, i hadn't even put my hand down yet.

The teacher just let out a little chuckle and slyly says, ""I kinda figured that.  That's my favorite type, my husband is INTP."" 

I was still in a state of semi-shock that i was the only one, but her words made me feel special for a moment.  I dont think i'll ever forget the experience of being so excited about something and then the feelings that came with being singled out like that. And looking back on it, I think it may have made me look cool from the other people in the class' perspective. 

I hadn't cared much about the topic for a while, then I found Reddit... and a few months later i found this sub.  Since then I have been reading a lot about all the types and trying to identify which group friends and family belong.  It's been a very interesting experience and it's almost turned into a game at this point.

Had it not been for that experience, i dont believe i would have remembered INTP or anything about MBTI.  

Anyone else ever have a moment like this (doesn't even have to be about MBTI) where you are singled out in such a fashion?  How did you handle it?

I bought this book shortly after [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/168w2r) threat was posted. It is a $4.99 digital download if anyone is interested in purchasing it. I will hit on all the highlights of the book and anything else seemingly of interest through my own wording and quotes from the author, and I will provide background information and basic type information primarily through links.
""Are you ready to absorb raw information?""

The author opens the book by explaining that while she did research all the information that she could on INTPs, she is not a licensed professional and that the MBTI system itself is hardly a proven concept. That aside there are citations to a number of peer-reviewed studies and links to several of them as well as many other relevent sources are given throughout the book. The book does not cover type dynamics, but does give a quick overview of the MBTI system and it's faults. I skipped the majority of this.

""INTPs are curious about many things—not least of which are themselves."" Being an INTP herself the author shows through understanding that while should doesn't have a $850 license she does comprehend what it means to be INTP and the implications of such a diagnosis. She gets to the, what is the expression, meat and potatoes? of the subject by explaining the [general characteristics](http://www.typelogic.com/intp.html) of our happy little family. She notes our position as the ""most abstract of the Rationals"" and theory rather than application being our domain. In fact, we can be so content with our own thoughts and ideas it is entirely appropriate to say we ""...are often content to observe without participating."" Something I notice about myself far too often. It's not all sunshine and rainbows though: ""INTPs are one of the most absentminded types, rivalled perhaps only by the INFP."" She follows through making a reference to the comedic ""grey-haired 
professor with his head in the clouds and his nose in a book."" A comparison as justified as any comparison could hope to be.

After the general descriptions are completed the next matter in place is that of our ""sick"" sense of humor, often requiring the listener to ""have eight years of math and speak fluent Latin."" It does give me joy, personally, to know I am one of a relatively small number of people on Earth who could appreciate some of the jokes I make. She also makes a point I remember seeing made on this subreddit at some point: ""...some INTPs report that they keep all the hilarity contained in their heads; outsiders see nothing but a vaguely bemused expression or perhaps a smirk, if anything at all."" It is something I wonder every time I see someone grin and chuckle to themselves in the corner of an otherwise silent classroom. Could this one be as far in his head as I am? “...few men possessed so rich a flow of language, [or] so great
a fund of amusing anecdotes, which were made the more interesting from their being well-timed &amp; 
well-told.” &lt;- I am unsure who stated this, though it was used in the book and seems quite fitting.

Ah, one my favorite subjects: Debates, everyone loves a good argument right? We usually end being sole defenders of our views, simply because they are not the norm. This leads to a ""gag reflex"" for the opposing individual, so they view our point as absurd. The author uses quite an effective example to explain our use of the Socratic method. Sadly, it is too large to fit in the post so I will post it in a comment as ""Note #1.""

And this is where I break.  
**Part 2**  

Moss does not fail to mention the INTPs search for absolute or ""pure"" truth, whether or not it is in his or hers best interest, no matter the damage done to ones argument. Witnessing an INTP debate a subject in which they have a particular interest or a deep understanding ""is like a chessmaster who is one mental step ahead of
their opponent."" Once the trap is set the INTP only needs to wait for their opponent to agree with them before clamming and locking the door behind them. See Notes #2A and #2B. Another point that comes to mind (that was mentioned in the book, and briefly in quoted text here) is that of the misrepresentation or oversimplification of an INTPs point by the opposing party, usually forcing the Thinker to say “No, you’re the one who said that. All I said was that...” a situation I have actually found myself in several times today. Unlike the majority of the human race (even, and maybe even especially, here in the United States) INTPs are very precise in the word choice and diction, carefully choosing the proper weight and meaning of every word they use and insuring it is absolutely appropriate for the given situation. INTPs have it both ways when it come to composing thought into language. INTPs can have a hard time of thinking of how to word a statement at all, at it can take quite some time to organize the purely abstract concept into language. But we are also gifted with spectacular diction and ability to form complex language. As a matter of fact, many arguments would be avoided altogether if the terms of the discussion would have been agreed and defined correctly beforehand. See Note #3. And like most serious matters, INTPs dislike the addition of emotion in debates. We are in the business of logic and truth, right and wrong, not competitions and baseless fights. Such ""arguments"" are rarely productive for either side.  
**Part 3**

The end of page 21 (of 247, yes) begins the section on INTPs and politics. For this section I believe it simplest if I list all the findings of the various studies mentioned in the book.  
Intuitives are more engaged in politics than Sensors.  
Intuition is linked with a liberal stance, where Sensors are generally conservative, making INTPs liberal.  
TJ is associated with the American Republican Party, whereas F is linked to the Democratic Party. INTPs tend to be Independent.  
Democrats are associated with FP.  
""Political Alienation"" (discontent or disconnection) is connected with Introversion.  
Thinkers oppose Feelers on the death penalty, I'll humor myself by seeing if anyone guesses it, I think you will.  

Here comes the sections dedicated to Religion and Church. While INTPs have the highest rates of both Agnostics and Atheists, 16.2% and 11.1% respectively, the majority of INTPs are religious (72.2%). INTPs tend to prefer the more ""introverted"" elements of religion. Prayer, meditation, study, and reading, with attractions to remote hermitages and monasteries with a rule of silence. Continuing the pattern of logical consistency INTPs seem to be drawn to theology and proper doctrine. ""INTPs, however, were the type least likely (20.2%) to use 'rely on religious beliefs' as a coping method for stress. Considering that most INTPs believe in a higher spiritual power, it would seem that religion does not tend to create dependency in this type.""  
**Part 4**  

Most religious organizations are led by extraverts, feelers and judgers, not a friendly place for the timid INTP. ""For example, is an INTP likely to be enthusiastic when the EFJ pastor says cheerfully, “Okay, 
everybody! Stand up and give your neighbor a hug!”?"" I'll let you answer that, INTPs.  
After the sections regarding Church and Church Culture there is one on Cults and how they reform their member's personality types. [Here](http://www.pureheartvision.org/resources/docs/yeakley/The%20Discipling%20Dilemma.pdf) is an included (as a link anyway) PDF file that goes into much greater depth than the book.  
Introducing, the generalization: The Lazy Rational. The is due to our emphasis on our own internal world and our Perceiving tendencies. Our sense of achievement comes from completion and understanding in our internal world, not carrying out our ideas or making something of our theories or proofs. Even though we are quick to come to the conclusion of our own laziness, it take considerable mental power to do the processing and form the thoughts that we are known for. Who is to say that work of the mind is less important or less exerting that work of the hand? After all, without your brain your hand hasn't much to do. Through all this effort others may never give a sign of doing anything at all, unless an observer catches a glance of ""...a bead of saliva gliding down the corner of the INTP’s mouth, provided that the INTP can be seen behind the cover of their book."" See Note #4.  
**Part 5**

INTPs (and to a lesser extent ISTPs) have been found to be the most active casual inventors, or someone who spends ~36 hours a week developing inventions. ""There were 5.88 times as many INTPs as would be expected (9 total out of the 32 participants) in comparison to the general population. The nearest runner ups were the ISTPs; there were 2.55 times as many ISTPs as would be expected."" While a single study cannot be trusted as infallible, it does show that INTPs can and do create prototypes of their inventions.

The next section deals in our favorite subject, faking social skills. ""Unliked [shame n her!] most people, INTPs do not come preprogrammed with acceptable social behavior patterns. Rather, they learn to fit in through conscious observation and deliberate mimicry.  While other people talk, the INTP watches and wonders, “Am I nodding too often?  Should I speak up, or remain silent? Should I fold my arms, put my hands in my pockets, or try to gesture?  Should I touch this person in a friendly, casual way?  Where?  How much are they smiling?  Am I smiling too much?  How long 
should I laugh?  How close should I stand?” Through necessity we play roles much like an actor on a stage in order to be accepted. Not for the sake of acceptance, but because we don't have any other way to effectively get along with people outside our mind. INTPs are social chameleons, and like chameleons INTPs ""...s don’t have to think about changing their skin color to match leaves and branches--it just happens.""  Moss brings up an interesting point, would taking acting classes make INTPs better at their game of mimicry? I actually have a rather insignificant amount of trainer as an actor and I can confidently say that every little bit helps and is surprisingly noticeable. Just something to think about. I will let the author handle the section covering small talk:  
""Since INTPs are not terribly interested in the everyday details of other people’s lives, they tend to have 
a poor recall for names, faces, and personal information.  It doesn’t help that they tend to “space out” 
when people begin to discuss the boring stuff, either.  
With practice, INTPs become skilled at nodding and making responsive noises at appropriate times, 
while internally wondering whether dolphins have language or thinking about how Star Wars breaks 
the laws of physics.  They do not intercept half the personal information poured upon them, and they 
easily forget what they do hear because they find it rather uninteresting.  
A popular ice breaking activity has each person in a group share their name and a personal detail about 
themselves.  (INTPs don’t like sharing personal details about themselves, but if compelled...)  Will this 
exercise help the INTP get to know the rest of the group? No. Shortly after the exercise is over, they 
will wipe every name and personal detail from their brain.""  
**Part 6**

Now for something I am known for, the 1,000 yard stare, or ""Death Glare."" ""This facial expression is actually not a glare, but the INT’s neutral face. The mistaken effect of a glare is produced by unbroken direct eye contact, prolonged silence, and an utterly impassive face. The Death Glare may also be mistaken for depression."" People tend to assume the negative when someones face is utterly unfeatured, comprised of no emotion. Not only do they assume negatively about the INTPs emotional state, but also their thoughts, they generally believe the INTP is picking out everything he or she finds wrong with anyone caught in the gaze. The reason I am unsure, possibly because they feel as though no emotion is as bad as negative emotion, or is a cover for negative emotions?

I was somewhat horrified to learn that I was in the only one in the class. Not so much because of what it says about INTPs, but the scarcity of people like me (1%).

I have all the classic traits. I jump from interest to interest, attaining a good understanding quickly, but quickly lose interest as soon as I feel that I have a comfortable level of understanding. Particularly if I understand what I would need to do to excel, but realise I lack the drive to execute on it.

For example, I took up photography on a whim. I spent months reading books and experimenting on how my camera worked. I then decided to start a wedding photography business, so I researched business structures and strategies. Then I taught myself HTML and flash so I could set up my website. After three years of being moderately successful (~30k a year as a side business to my 9 to 5 job), I suddenly shut it down, realising that I would never have the time to become the top in my field.

The ability to self learn and put in all the work to set up the business in such a short time buoys me, but my lack of drive to take it any further is disappointing.

I've done the same with sports. I became my school's top hockey goalie only after six months of taking up the game. I was a single figure golfer at 16, but have hovered at the same handicap ever since.

The one word that irks me is ""potential"". It has been used so often in my life to describe me. It has such good connotations at the start, but wears thin after a few years.

I'm not sure where I was going when I started writing this. I just felt that this subreddit offered the potential to vent about what I like and dislike about my personality in a safe environment. I only have one friend who is likely an INTP, and can otherwise talk to about this.

- Firstly I'm not an unpopular person and would say I have quite a number of close friends, however even after spending large amounts of time with people I feel as though I can easily cut them out of my life. If I do not see a close friend for a while (e.g away at/from University) it does not bother me at all, even people I'm very close with, their absence does not bother me, even after I am told they are upset with my lack of contact/avoiding the'r attempts of contact.

- This often leads me to the feeling (something that makes me feel uncomfortable within myself) that I'm ""using"" people, that I don't really have that much of a connection to them but I get something out of knowing them. This sounds horrible I think and I don't think I'm a bad person but I can't seem to help it.

-I tend to flit between girls very often, (I'm not a player, I do not sleep with them) I'm starting to think thats not my goal. I like to talk to them up until the point where I think they like me and then I'm bored of the interaction, I think this to be fair is quite common in people who ""like the chase"". Sometimes I feel almost as though the interactions are a game that I need to ""win"" by getting them to like me, its very odd, I feel as though I need to just understand the person. 

-When I have become very close to people and I understand them well, I find it very easy to twist and manipulate their arguments in a beneficial way for me. I would like to point out I hate arguing and avoid it at all costs and am a very very relaxed person however in these particular situation one cannot be avoided. But when I am in them I was told that, ""I could never be wrong, am extremely stubborn and would always make them feel stupid for feeling what they feel"" I really didn't mean this.

-I also find when chatting to someone where I have a long time to think non real-time conversations e.g texting, online messaging. I find I create elaborate strings of conversation that can seem completely unconnected to reach an end goal that is desirable for me.

Right this is almost certainly a complete B.S post for everyone else to read you're awesome if you can be arsed to read it all. I don't hope for much interest as it is also completely self-indulgent post I feel, it would just be really cool if someone else was similar to me so I could know that I'm not completely loopy.

Last night while sitting and observing people for half an hour I had an epiphany. Other people do not have meaningful conversations with most people they meet in a bar.

I've read from several sources that INTPs tend to have addictions.  A culmination of the texts I've read and my own personal insights seem to suggest that it's a way to escape the ""INTP-ness"" of our brains.

I read *somewhere* that INTPs are prone to cigarette smoking.  Personally, I've battled this addiction for decades and have quit in excess of 30 times - always to fall off the wagon and start up again.  I go at the quit all gung-ho, stay clean for a couple of months only to start up again.  I've tried to break down the addiction into the ""why"" to figure out how to stop smoking forever and it seems to boil down to that it provides a comfort when my brain becomes overloaded with thinking and/or stresses in life that are exacerbated by my thinking.

I've tried to replace this addiction with exercise, meditation/yoga, hobbies, critical thinking about exactly what I'm doing to myself, etc. and while it helps a little, it does not discourage my eventual use.  Even using nicotine gum, lozenge, patch or snus does not placate my addiction.

Research suggests that persons with mental illness are more prone to addiction and smoking cigarettes, in particular.  I do have ""mental issues"" but they seem to come from the way I think - my ""INTP-ness"".  I wonder if the INTP mind mimics that of mental illness?  Or, if thinking like an INTP causes mental illness?

I have also found in recent years that ingesting cannabis daily makes me feel more...""together"" - I guess, for lack of a better word at this moment.  It's fairly difficult to describe succinctly - it doesn't make me happy nor shut the thoughts off in my brain but it makes things tolerable, interesting and makes me a more outwardly emotional person.  It seems to break the shackles of my brain temporarily.  But, it has come to the point where taking a tolerance break turns me into someone I do not want to be - sober me cannot make the connection to finding those things that cannabis brings out in me.  So, I guess, that's ""addiction"".

Years of therapy and every medication under the sun has done very little for sober me.  Substance abuse counseling does nothing.  Critically thinking does nothing.  CBT does nothing.  Retreats do nothing.  The only answer I have for my addictions is that I cannot mentally handle being ""me"".  The INTP brain I possess is either the root of my problems or exacerbates them.  

I have to learn to deal with having INTP personality traits and I don't have the wisdom, skills or insight enough to reach this without substances.     

If you have an addiction - be it a classic vice or hell, even an addiction to exercise, the internet, porn - why do you think you do it?  Is it because it is the only way you have found to deal with being yourself?  Do you think it's a genetic predisposition?  Do you just like it and couldn't give any fucks as to why you do it?

The people who identify most with my romantic relationship struggles are the straight dudes in my life. But what they have going for them (and what is working against me) is the social stereotype that straight women will generally have ""more feelings"" and be ""more senstitive"" than their straight boyfriends. So they begin from there, with an unspoken understanding of a likely emotional predisposition clash. I attempt to explain this to the ladies I date. Saying, ""I'm more like a stereotypical boyfriend, no matter what I look like, please keep that in mind"" is never taken seriously due to the way I look (I've been told I have a ""doll face"" and it is totally not a joke).

Not only does being a lesbian give me a tiny dating pool (about 10% of a typical straight dating pool size, if that even), but lesbians for some awful reason tend to be STRONG F. ""Lesbian processing*"" is not a myth. It is a relationship expectation for most lesbians, and a living nightmare for this INTP.

*Lesbian processing: Talking intangible feelings to death, then into reincarnation, then more death, then reincarnation as unrecognizable morphs of original statements [infinite loop]. Just a giant mess, basically, not rooted in any certain tangible situation or clear context. They can't even believe that another lesbian couldn't understand what they're feeling before they give any context to their words. Horrifying!

I must know if there are any other INTP lesbians out there. I can't be the only one... ANYBODY?

I'm still young, and I recently got my first job. After one month of being in it, (it's a part-time, drink-making work), I got called over by my managers for a review of my performance. General stuff aside such as speed and work-learning, they told me that I seemed ""uncomfortable"" and ""stressed"" around people (I'm not, really, I'm just doing my job and I don't pick fights), and that I appeared to be lost sometimes (when I'm really just thinking about my novels while washing dishes or something). But what really hit home was that they said I seemed too protective of myself, and to be honest, I never really knew I was like that.

I've always had trouble making the ""close friends"" that I still dream of, ever since Middle School, and while I was never mean, rude, or bashful to anyone, I never seemed to be able to take a step further to building a proper social interaction.

I feel like I always try too hard, to smile, to be polite, to ask questions (which usually end up getting unanswered or ignored and I feel dumb for doing so), but I'm always, *always* feeling like the odd one out, whether it be at a club at school, and now, work. I don't find much joy out of socializing (it's so tiring, and I don't like people too much sometimes), but it's a necessary thing in this life and I do find myself jealous of those who have those best friends who always seem to be by their side.

I thought I could do the subreddit a service by adding some clarity to everyone's understanding so that we may all think clearer and more rigorously in our getting-to-the-bottom-of-things.

About me: I have a masters in math and teach pre-cal/calc at a community college. I hesitate to call myself even an amateur mathematician.

TL;DR: The incompleteness theorem shows that in a formal axiomatic system of sufficient richness, there are true statements that cannot be shown to be true by permuting the axioms.

**Some Context** 

Most of the misuse of the Incompleteness Theorem (IT) stems from a misunderstanding of what mathematicians do. Most people only encounter math in their science and math classrooms and get the impression that math is all about describing natural gas laws and finding the derivative of f(x) at x = 2 and such. This is to what mathematicians do as learning to drive is to what automotive engineers do (or, perhaps, quality control engineers at auto companies).

Mathematicians are in the business of proving things. The tools you use in the classroom are taught and used with confindence because they have been proven to work. I don't mean proved in the way that you might prove to a kid on the playground that you can spit ten feet, I mean proved in the sense that there is no conceivable universe in which a particular statement could be false. What mathematicians do is more akin to those proofs you did in geometry and trig identities you did in pre-cal than any calculation.

Mathematicians operate under a couple fundamental assumptions:

*everything in math happens for a reason*

*every well-formed mathematical statement is either true or false*

Under these assumptions, if there is a true mathematical statement there must a story to tell about why that statement *must* be true. This story is what a proof is. Whithout a proof of its truth or falsity, the status of any given statement is unknown.

You may be wondering how such a story is written. How far back do you go? In any mathematical context, you are operating under a set of *axioms*, unproven and sometimes implicit statements that are assumed to be true. There is no getting around this. Any mathematical truth, implicitly, has the addendum ""assuming some particular set of axioms."" [Euclid's Elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements) is *the* classic about how axiomatic systems give rise to complex truths.

In a sense, math is then the study of axiomatic systems. A proof in an axiomatic system, in principle, is a combination and rearrangement of axioms until you get the desired statement.

**Some History**

In the early 20th century, a group of mathematicians and philosophers got serious about math as an axiomatic system and tried to lay out explicitly a set of fundamental axioms that underly all of mathematics.

Their goal was to formalize all of mathematics into a symbolic system so that the truth of any mathematical statement could in principle be determined by checking if it was a permutation of the fundamental axioms. Such a formal system would end mathematician's jobs in theory, as the proof of any statement could be determined mechanically.

Such a system was desired to have 2 properties:

1) It must be *consistent*. A consistent system contains no statements such that both the statement and its negation are provable by extension of its axioms; in other words the axioms don't contradict themselves. A system that is inconsistent is useless.

2) It should be *complete*. In a complete system, all true statements can be shown to be true through some permutation of the axioms. A system that is complete reduces proof finding in principle to a mechanical process.

[Principia Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) was the most serious effort to produce a consistent formal axiomatic system to capture all mathematics in a *complete* manner. The structure of Principia was designed to avoid paradoxes as well, statements that were neither true or false.

If this effort were successful, then the two fundamental assumptions of mathematicians (all statements are either true or false, and either was provable) would come to its culmination.

**The Incompleteness Theorem**

What Godel did was very cleverly construct a statement within the Principia framework that had to be true but could not be proven by the axioms of Principia. Thus he showed that Principia could not be *complete* and thus the ""Incompleteness Theorem.""

The way he did this was constructive in that the method could be applied to any formal axiomatic system that can capture the behavior of whole numbers.

A brief outline of his method:

Godel used a coding system whereby the symbols of a formal axiomatic system could be encoded into integers as exponents on the prime numbers.

For example:

2^3* 3^7* 5^2 could be translated as ""the 3rd symbol in the system followed by the 7th symbol in the translation followed by the 2nd symbol in the translation."" The first prime (2) gives which symbol comes first, the second prime (3) gives the second symbol, and so forth.

2^3* 3^7* 5^2 can also be interpretted directly as 437300.

Thus he could encode statements about whole numbers into whole numbers.

By doing this he was able to construct a statement equivalent to ""This statement cannot be proved.""

Then there are 2 things that can happen:

1) The statement can be proved, thus a false statement has been proved and the system in inconsistent.

2) The statement cannot be proved and the system is incomplete.

Thus any formal axiomatic system rich enough to describe the integers must be incomplete.

**Conclusions**

First of all: The incompleteness theorem is a statement *about axiomatic systems*. If you are not talking about axiomatic systems, it probably is not appropriate to cite the incompleteness theorem.

More broadly: The quest to find a fundamental set of axioms for mathematics was proven to be a wasted effort. (Sorry, Bertrand)

Since the incompleteness theorem, some less-trivial results have been shown to also be true but unprovable as result of axioms (See Gentzen or the Paris-Harrington Theorem).

To ponder:

What the ""territory"" is exactly when dealing with mathematics if axiomatic systems are the ""maps"" we use?

What is the relationship between formal reasoning and bursts of creative mathematical intuition that have guided math's development?

Hello Brothers and Sisters,

My name is Justin. I wanted to write a little bit here for the struggling INTP's out there: you know, like all of us.

First, I have a feeling that many of you absolutely *despise* being an INTP. We rarely speak to strangers, abhor small talk and choose solitude over social events nine times out of ten. While this all seems normal to us, the majority of the population thinks the opposite and we are constantly regarded as weird, aloof, eccentric etc. I could go on and on about this but I know you INTP's have felt like the alien before. We are extremely misunderstood by our peers.

So what is an INTP to do? **Embrace your strengths!** Although life is difficult for us, I am a strong believer that today's technology (I live in California so I am generalizing/biased) allows the INTP to pursue a life of meaning. Find something that you love doing -- something you are good at -- and figure out a way to make a living from it.

INTP's are logical, analytical, objective, curious and big-picture oriented. None of these qualities are valued at a job that doesn't require a PhD. In fact, our dominant qualities are often looked at in contempt by companies, as many are simply looking for sheep to keep the wheels turning. 

So here is what happens to an INTP. We find a job -- it's like most jobs, where an incompetent manager tells you what to do and you obey him/her blindly or you are punished. While many would be happy that they ""barely have to think"" on the job, we INTP's are dying a little bit inside every day we have to work in that shit hole. We get depressed about it, people around us sense it and -- even more than usual -- distance themselves from us. Rinse and repeat for the majority of the INTP's life, and it's not hard to see why we can be such downers.


**BUT FUCK THAT!** Fuck all that nonsense INTP brethren -- we kick ass and take names, and you (if you don't already) need to realize it. Not only realize, but REMEMBER:

We are capable of absolutely brilliant insight. 

We can process ridiculous amounts of information at an incredible speed. 

We have a pervading sense of social justice. 

We are objective and therefore accepting 

We are kind, gentle and legitimately concerned for the well being of mankind, despite how the majority of them treat us.


Don't settle for society's bullshit INTP's. Yeah our room is messy, and yeah we lose stuff all the time, but that's because our minds are CONSTANTLY at work. Your mind is -- i'm gonna say it -- *the most capable* of intellectual genius, and you should never give up trying to find what makes you happy. When you do find your spot in the universe, you will produce works of brilliance, absolute brilliance. Yes it's an uphill battle, but the view from the top is beautiful. 




**EDIT**: Looks like my pseudo-confidence made some people mad. Get over it, sheesh. I'm just trying to help INTP's realize their capabilities, is the hostility really necessary? Methinks we have some INTJ's in here. 



**EDIT**: Ok I guess I have to spell it out for a few of you. Being at the top DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS WORTHLESS. There couldn't BE a top if there weren't others laying the foundation. Every personality type is extremely important to the stability of the human race. Some of you are drawing some erroneous conclusions -- stop thinking so black and white. 


**EDIT**: Deleted the sentence that got a few of you upset. Obviously it was not interpreted how I wanted it to be, sooo it's gone. I should have known better making an absolute statement of that magnitude around INTPs.",,False,,t5_2qhvl,1344021500.0,,,True,t3_xlxdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/xlxdi/find_your_purpose/,

Alternately, what quotes or ideas do you strongly identify with?",46,6,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1goaa1/what_is_an_inspirational_deep_or_profound_quote/,"A few i hate:

""If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all""

Life isn't about being ""nice"" and sometimes criticism must be harsh


""If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.""

Or, you know, life is full of assholes. Liking everyone is not synonymous with being a good person.


""Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.""

While this may have been personally true for Hemingway, i believe it to be a huge fallacy to believe that intelligence cannot bring with it happiness. Cynicism often comes with intelligence, but they are not one and the same.


""Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less""

Actually, it is neither. Self analysis is how we develop. Clever wordplay does not equal depth of meaning

A few quotes i love:

""Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't."" - Bill Nye

""If I am, death is not. If death is, I am not. Why fear that which cannot exist when I do?"" ~Epicurus

“We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior.”

""The best time to plant a tree is twenty-five years ago. The second best time is today.""

“If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.” Albert Einstein

I strongly recommend spending some time and reading through the 5 articles -- You may learn a lot about who you are.

A quote from this most recent article simply describes ways in which many of us probably think:

1.       I feel reasonably intelligent, and I learn quickly, yet I can't seem to do well in school. The kind of ""knowledge"" they want in school doesn't seem like real knowledge. It's a game I can't seem to figure out. Each time I try harder to adjust, I do even worse.
2.      I try to approach people and socialize, but I can't seem to connect. People don't really care to hear what I want to say. I don't really want to talk about what they do either. So I study people even more diligently to connect better. I apply the results of my theories and observations, but I end up feeling even more removed from them.
3.      I don't think I'm happy. Why am I not happy? I can think of several reasons why I should be happy. Or at least not sad. What is wrong with me? I make adjustments that should ensure my happiness. The result--still not happy.

Here's the current draft of the goals planned for my lifetime in no particular order.

___

I have only accomplished one, arguably 2, of these goals so far and currently working on an important third. It's worth noting this tentative list is a floor, not a ceiling [ie- it's conceivable I will want to learn more but never less]. Obviously I will not be able to accomplish even 30% of this list in one 80-year life time, especially using standard routes of university education. I am confident these are solvable problems given enough time and effort.

/r/INTP *please* ignore the ridiculous magnitude of my list while sharing your own, but **don't hold back!** I'm intensely curious of my fellow mindmates' aspirations and dreams.

Fighting off the feeling of that creeping depression with hundreds of dollars worth of nights out having an artificially-induced ""good time"". Who am I kidding? Casual sex seems ideal but it'll never cut it. 

Constantly seeing and reading about people that argue, fight, love, and experience happiness, sadness, and anger. Dealing with problems together. Having more than just sex. Having security in the thought that they have each other if anything.

My purpose in life has become nothing other than finding the one who both understand and accepts me for the complicated being that I am. To find someone who cannot help but be in love with me for that, and vice versa. And I feel like everything in life pales in comparison to that culminating moment. Something of that immensity, that *gravity*... I've yet to experience it but I know that's the only thing I'd ever fully commit my entire physical, emotional, and spiritual self into.

A great deal of overanalysis inside!,43,5,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/18ire0/does_this_intp_guy_like_me_help_an_intp_girl_out/,"I'm terrible at interpreting these sorts of signals because I am oblivious and generally overanalyze the hell out what little I am able to pick up on, so I need your help. Since we're both INTPs, neither of us is probably going to want to initiate things, and so since I'm female and a little older (I'm 29, he's 25), I feel like the burden will probably fall to me to say something - but I want to be prepared. I have the additional difficulty that I have a lot of trouble differentiating ""best-friend"" feelings from romantic feelings - my best friends are all INTPs with whom I've had at least some sort of romantic relationship, and I'm honestly not sure that it's even possible for me to differentiate between those feelings at all. I think it might be different for INTP guys though? I don't know.

Anyway, /r/INTP, does this guy like me?

Anecdata that might help:

- We have frequent, long, freewheeling conversations wherein we genuinely seem to agree about just about everything important (but not in a boring way). Our values are almost perfectly aligned, but not quite enough to be boring. We lose track of time talking to each other every time we're able to get into a serious conversation (we work together). We've taken a couple of afternoons off just to talk to each other, and our conversations are almost always serious and important-feeling.

- I see him looking at me out of the corner of his eye fairly frequently, but he seems to avoid eye contact a lot more with me than he does with other people. When we do lock eyes, I definitely feel a big spark, but that's just me and it's impossible to tell what other people are feeling so that isn't a very valuable data point. 

- He seems to cycle between hot/cold with me - some days we act like we've been best friends forever, other days he seems distant and cold and almost seems to try to avoid me. I try not to take it personally because he has a lot on his plate right now, and if anything it just makes me fall harder for him.

- He isn't super into the whole INTP thing, but one night a couple of weeks after we'd met, we'd had a few drinks together and I asked him if he'd ever taken a personality test. I told him he seemed like an INTP to me - he seemed really taken aback that I had observed him like that and it seemed to build a lot of easy intimacy between us. I was able to predict a lot of things about him and he was a little speechless. I get the sense he isn't used to being understood  by anybody, much less women. 

- We're both super smart and he always acts really bashful when I compliment him or say ""brilliant!"" to a good idea he has or anything like that. This seems pretty normal but he seems to do it to a greater extent when I say anything than when anybody else says something.

- He's super-serious with me - he jokes around with most of the other people in our team, but always seems much more earnest and serious with me. This could just be that he's less comfortable with me - we've only known each other well for about a month or so (though in that time I've managed to become hopelessly smitten with him). 

- We teach each other stuff all the time. He's an ornithologist and I'm a landscape ecologist, and we have all sorts of fascinating information to share with each other. I swear to god, I don't think I've ever felt such a sense of romance as I do hearing him talk about birds. Since INTPs tend to build intimacy by exchanging information, sharing all of this super-interesting stuff with each other just makes me feel unbelievably romantic towards him (though I'm not sure if he feels the same way). 

Anyway, I know that you can't answer this question for me, really, and that I'm certainly presenting things in a super-biased way because I'm half in love with him already, but I would love to hear your thoughts regardless. Cheers, fellow INTPs!



**UPDATED**:
(moved my update up here from a late-breaking comment):

Okay, finally an update. I got tipsy Friday night and told him I was crazy about him, and he turned me down. He said he wasn't really looking for anything right now, that he was really super focused on work and thought it would be best if he didn't focus on anything else (he's in the middle of his masters field season for the project we're working on right now, and he has about a million other things to do too so he's not just making it up). I pressed him a little on whether it was really JUST work or if he really wasn't interested, and he said ""a little of both"" - so I assume he just wanted to let me down easy and simply isn't interested. It's been fairly awkward between us since then but things should go back to normal soon - hell, we're both INTPs, right? Christ knows we can always talk about work if need be.

On some level, I actually kind of wish I had just tried to kiss him because I still have a couple of lingering doubts about to what extent he's just talking himself out of this (we had just finished a long, fantastic, freewheeling conversation about what masculinity and gender roles mean, his cultural baggage with respect to New Englander emotional avoidance &amp; repression, etc etc). But I'm sure this is for the best, and it's actually a tremendous relief to get to stop thinking about it. I sure was wasting a lot of brain cycles trying to figure him out, interpret his seriously mixed signals, etc.

This has helped me more than anything else in terms of self-reflection and understanding myself, notably, my greatest weakness: Fe. So, Ti is our #1 trait, and Fe #4, however, they are two sides of the same coin. *Understanding this concept is of upmost importance.* Fe and Ti are the **same**, but opposite. The key word here, is **same.**

Once Ti become fully developed in our teens, Fe comes into the picture. And it's usually terribly expressed in us. But as an organism, developing Fe is our attractor, our goal in life. So everything we do revolves around our Fe, which happens to be our worst trait. Every single personality type works the same way, [read this](http://personalityjunkie.com/the-inferior-function/) for clarity. In other words, we have a desire to connect with others, and we're bad at it ;P This is why we love this subreddit. We love to post and share our ideas with the world. As we develop and mature as an individual, we become better at this. The trippy thing is, because Ti and Fe are two sides of the same coin, Fe is just as natural to us as Ti, but it's *unconscious*. Consciously developing our awareness of Fe, instead of pushing it to the side, in other words, conquering our demon, facing our fears, is the correct way to proceed. If you do not do this, you will not mature as an individual.

Because Fe is our attractor, and it's our worst trait, it's very common to express itself as a desire to become a famous world-changer, like a scientist or philosopher or prophet that changes humanity forever. This is also our 'Buddha nature', because Guatama was an INTP, and it's this selfless desire to connect with others that drives us. We are, as Plato calls, the philosopher - lovers of wisdom. In Plato's Republic, INTPs run the show, and they don't get paid for it. As soon as you mix money and politics, shit hits the fan, and you get some silly SJ's running the show. But anyways, our grandiose ideations are our downfall, both in relationships and job choices. Many an INTP will choose a career with grand ideas of making a huge impact, will become depressed and disappointed once they realize the hard truth of how much shittier society is than we could have ever imagined, at least in terms of corporate/government hierarchal structures. 

Our Fe is our demon, and our beauty. Master Fe, don't let Fe master you. I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. Much love, my buddha brothas. ",,False,,t5_2qhvl,False,,,True,t3_1c5tot,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1c5tot/how_to_overcome_fe_which_is_our_weakness_and/,

A life problem that I'm having is described in the title.  Since I don't seem to want anything in particular, it's making it very hard for me to live life well.  For example, career-wise, I'd like to follow my dreams, but I don't have any.  The best dream that I can muster is that I'd like to be a very knowledgeable person in all sciences including psychology, philosophy, and I also care about music and its history, and indeed to know whatever other knowledge of worth comes my way.  I also want to be a social person at a basic level, and I'd also like to be a loving person.  

My current field is physics/programming, and I'm trying to get into a medical physics M.Sc. program, and after that degree's done I'll most certainly have to work again, and hopefully the work in that field turns my crank enough (and also that I can get it).  Note that the dream above involves very little in the way of providing for others concretely, it really is just about my own knowledge.  Medical physics sounds like a way cool career but it's still hard for me to drive myself.  I've found that I have to surrender a fair bit of my dream in order to fit into society.  I also have to work pretty hard to accomplish this dream.  Also keep in mind how fleeting it is, that picture of myself only came to me on one day, and ever since I've just latched onto it in an effort to know what I want in life so I can have some purpose towards something.

I've actually made a lot of progress with this problem but I'd still like to hear your tips and thoughts, especially if you relate and have discovered anything.  I think this is pretty much what existentialism is.  I found that purpose can come from the self, in that what I should do with myself is to develop, grow, and really let the identity I choose/find in myself drive my actions and effect on the world.  (I found that reading The Outsider by Colin Wilson.)  But even with that knowledge, I find that I'm really slow at doing anything because my want for it to be done is so little, even if it's a completely selfish thing that furthers my strongest desires.  

By the way, another tip that I've found for myself is that I believe I need to get out of my head, and live with my body, active in some way.  I do interact with people but it needs to be in a more core kind of way.  I also find that so far in life I've relied on external pressures to keep me going, and I sort of burnt out on that, mostly because I'm old enough for society to stop doing that to me.

I know this borders on nihilism and I'm really trying to claw myself out.  Maybe it'll be a lot easier when I actually enter an environment of what I want.  I manage enough self control to actually work on my life for most of the day every day, but my efficiency is just the pits, and any real progress is taking weeks and weeks.  Ultimately, this is all so I can be a more effective person, which is driven out of the pursuit of happiness.  I'd really like to find more drive and passion.

I agree that there is no area in which I can claim an expert knowledge - keeping with the aquatic metaphor, I have no Marinas Trench of knowledge so deep and intense that only a few would ever go there.  People working in the hard sciences who have reduced their field of study to an incredibly narrow corner of knowledge might be said to have such a trench, while a true generalist, might, like Lake Chad, be vast but shallow.  I consider myself neither of these extremes.  For those un-familiar, Manitoba is a Canadian Province home to over 110,000 lakes - some of which are broad and shallow, others of which are quiet deep.  And that’s how I view my knowledge of the world - pits of varying depth, mixed with large tracts where there’s no knowledge at all - Manitoba.  The terrestrial areas represent huge swaths of pop culture, motor-sports, and ballet - while the various lakes represent things like astronomy - a small but deep lake - where I know a great deal of theory, but couldn’t spot a constellation to save my life, or 19th century literature, a broad lake where deep pockets mix with sandbars, or theatre - an average sort of lake, fairly deep, and fairly broad.

Since reaching adulthood, I have noticed something. I don't know to what extent this is attributable to my experiences as a youth, my environment at home, or genetics, but there is a pattern: I am only really friends with people who think that I am better than them and still like me anyway, and I only enjoy activities where I am clearly better than others who are participating in the activities and they like and respect me anyway.

I guess I just don't believe that I am introverted.

Logic/maths:

**Godel Esher Bach** Systems and logic thinking. Talks about mathematics, music and the rules of systems. Big thick book and quite dense. Has nice sketches with Achilles and the tortoise where they explore concepts in a dialogue. Very good book!

**Mathemagics** Guide to mental math. Learn to square 3 digit numbers mentally. Written by this guy: www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4vqr3_ROIk&amp;t=65 and shows that the system taught in schools is inferior.

**Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance** Story following a man on a journey across america on a bike whilst sharing Chataquas. Argues that quality is the bridging link between art, religion and logic. Because quality defines logic it cannot be defined because its circular reasoning. Story has elusive figure Phaedrus. Huge plot twist with the identity of this guy. The man was not insane, only those around him. Goes into the history of scientific method and why it is flawed. The author wields a fanatically sharp analytic knife of logic cutting through concepts and catagorising information beautifully throughout. Introduced me to the word gumption. Apparently a true story....

**A beginners guide to deconstruction the Universe** The geometrical origin of numbers. Looks at fractals and has fun workshops where you get out a pen and paper and construct shapes. 

Self development

**Predictable Irrational** Could be logic but best used here. Looks at why we do our irrational choices in detail. 

**Moonwalking with einstein** Book on memory and how to improve it. Written by a jounalist who covered the US memory championships knowing nothing about it. Comes back a year later and wins it! Uses imagining a journey or place to place memories. You retake your journey and remember the interactions which are associated with information. Google will provide a better explanation.

**The Brain that changes itself** Neuroplasticity. Your mind is based in your brain, the structure and connections in it defines how you think. A girl was having eplileptic seizures originating in her left frontal lobes (The frontal lobes are the part of the brain animals don't have. Responsible for the important thinking). The doctors removed the entire left frontal. She lost her ability to do abstractual conceptualization overnight. She could not translate a clocks hands into the actual time. Through practice and dedication she relearnt and her brain changed. Other neural circuits took over these tasks.

If a girl with half of the highest part of the brain removed can relearn to be a normal person so you would not notice anything if you spoke to her then what can you do with a (hopefully?) intact brain?

**The wisdom of insecurity** Buddhist concepts on awareness of the now put through a brutal logicalization.  This book will bitchslap your world view into a happier one. Don't let the taint of religion put you off. There is no way you can pull the sum total of his reasoning apart. Should be read by everyone

**Mindfulness in plain english** Works with the above book well. Plain english explanation on how to meditate. The author narrows in on a certain style of meditation but you can apply his concepts to all things. Google will let you know how beneficial meditation is.

**59 seconds** 59 second tips and tricks on how to do things, how to keep yourself doing things (still working on that one... hah!), how to be happy, creative and all sorts. The author Dr Richard Wiseman must spend his time reading every sociology and psychology study he can find and making connections between things that cut straight through the bs. Very clever man with a very clearsighted view on the world.

**Awareness through movement** The original book the the feldenkrais method. Endorsed by the brain books author normon diodge. Re-structures your body image to be closer to what it is rather than a distorted perception. Improved sensory clarity, health and more efficient movements. Practiced slow movements allow you to learn the art of fine motor skills. I still knock things over....

**The einstein factor** Based around a study that apparently proves a certain technique called image streaming boosts your IQ dramatically. Certainly increases your visualization skills but the study has yet to be published and the book was written years back. Nethertheless it has a good description of the feedback process. The most effective way we learn...

**48 laws of power** The laws that if followed make you socially invincable. Sociopaths wet dream. I can't say I instinctively use most of the techniques, I prefer to batter peoples words to pieces with logic when required. Still a good read for learning about social power dynamics and if you can learn to use your favourites better then its a step up the social hierachy.



**Books with descriptive titles**

* How to win friends and influence people.  (What it says on the tin)

* The rule book for arguements. (My stepdad would be pissed off at this book if he knew its contributions)

*Drawing on the right side of the brain (Learn to draw as you see!)


***Honorary mention***

The house of leaves. This is the only book I recommend with a **warning**. This book has the capacity to send someone insane. Fiction (I HOPE!) and I am part way through it.

I feel sometimes, often in a classroom, that often people are just on a different set of tracks than me. I will be saying things that i feel are obvious and casual when people say that i am being ""smart"". 

Do any other INTPs have a similar feeling of superiority when among peers or cohorts? Do you also try and shirk away from it? 

This could be just me, thanks for reading.

Eg. A very good friend complains about having a bad back and being unable to sleep, i also feel they have mood swings. they don't exercise or eat very well and sleeps on their stomach.

Evidence would suggest that their posture could be fixed by sleeping on their back and loosing some weight and their sleep problems are likely a result of bad diet and lack of exercise. Mood swings are also (in my experience) caused by bad diet and lack of exercise.

There is evidence also that exercise and good diet can reduce stress, increase energy, better confidence, better memory and cognitive ability, longer life expectancy, ect...

But telling someone they should change their diet, loose some weight and start working out is almost always a big no no. It wouldn't even be a big change, eat more fruit, drink more water, take a 20 min walk every day or two, you wouldn't even need to physically exert yourself.

And he has taught me stuff - he is good at sex and then attacks me with cuddles  :/ 

I highly recommend interacting with people in this manor if they are much different from yourself.  It makes you grow as a person.  I really like when I can observe people almost like research subjects and then learn from them.  Here is what my ESTP fuck buddy has actually said to me (paraphrased) and  taught me about life:

 
EDIT: the autoformat messed up the number sequence and I dont  knw how to fix it. :(  sorry.  

1. ""look, dont worry about 'overwhelming' yourself with too much activities in life.  That feeling that you're supper busy with all your friends, hobbies, and endeavors?  That's not stress.  It's the feeling of being alive.  Get up off of your ass and just DO something. I love your brain but you think too much.""



2.""You're mistake is that you are trying to think during sex.  Don't think during sex.  Just feel and be aware of your body.  It's way better that way.  It's the same as indulging in amazing food.  Try to live in the present moment - this is one of the keys to life.  IF you have trouble with this, meditate and also practice by having lots of sex.   And during sex, be straight forward, communicate etc.  Ask for what you want.  Ask what your partner wants.  Have fun.  I'm gonna fuck you like an animal later and then give you a big hug after.  Sorry, the cuddles are mandatory.   Put down that instructional book about sex. You dont need it.  Fuck the rules anyway.""  

3.  It's hard to explain but he takes weird risks but not dumb ones.  It has encouraged me to be a teensy bit more impulsive (in a good way) but I can't quite understand his attitude about certain things.  For example he said that when he was in university, he would purposely study hard but make sure he was slightly under prepared because he found he performed better that way and he liked the adrenaline rush.  Weird.   We are terrible going out for some type of outing together.  I am indecisive, he is impulsive.  we will stand in line for ice cream and them one of us will change our minds and feel like sushi instead.  Repeat about 3 times before we finally settle on McDonald because we are starving because it took too long to decide.  Or he will get distracted by a friends text and the plans will change completely.  :/


4.  ""Its cool that you dont intend to have any kids ever.  Most women want kids.  It's better without them.  Kids are so much fun.  But you can't have an epic adventurous life with kids around.  You're doing ok so far with your adventurous life -not too bad.  You're a bit of a late bloomer though.  It's ok, I wont let you get lost in all your books, I'll rescue you from your pit of books!   I like seeing people not be conventional.  You have the potential to live an unconventional life.  You're so smart.  You can read a bit less, no?  I mean I didnt' mean that smart women aren't awesome, because they are.  You know what I mean.""   (eh I listen to his babbling about 'fucking the system' and he tries to listen to my babbles about history, politics,  and philosophy) 


5.  ""Hey, want to ride on my motorcycle?""  ""no""  "" why not? it feels like you're flying!""  ""no.  It's scary.  You'll crash and we will die""  ""No I wont'  I'm to handsome to die.  Besides, fear is fun"".  ""no."" '""fine.""




It has been interesting and I have learned a lot so far.  I like when I can observe and learn a lot of things about life from my friends.  I love having lots of different friends who all have different types of personalities, opinions, perspectives etc.  ESTP guy and I are good as friends and sexual partners.  But we would be disastrous in a romantic relationship.  We don't have a deep enough connection or enough in common and we piss eachother off all the time.

So basically the first time this ever happened to me was with a girl I met she really shouldn't have been anything extraordinary but for some reason she became that and so so much more to me I think without even realizing (She may have I am really obvious with situations like this). The best way I can describe it is like my brain attached to her in the most emotional illogical way I have ever felt, It was like I needed her in my life if I was ever going to be happy it was like she was the greatest revelation in human history. This confused and scared the hell out of me this actually led me to my first serious anxiety attack in my life (Only ever had 2) When I realized there was no reason behind this and no way I could possibly ""keep"" her around me I proceeded to freak out even more I would describe the whole situation as a clusterfuck of emotions, eventually I didn't see her for a long long time and managed to get over her and move but every now and then I think back and wonder ""Seriously what in the fuck was going on there brain?"" It was like I had a volcanic eruption of my suppressed feeling side that completely took control. 

The whole reason I'm posting this is the beginning of this cycle feels like it's starting again and I'm scared as hell because the person these feeling are being directed at is again a girl but she's been a good friend for years and the situation is complicated to say the least, I'm currently in a very happy relationship but yet I still manage to have these uncontrollable feelings towards someone I know I really should stay away from in that sort of way.

There is only room for six, and one of them is typically someone I 'use' a la an 'HM bitch' in the Pokemon games.

Everyone else resides in ~~Bill's PC~~ the back of the mind and is only 'taken out' when appropriate.

I was always the quiet kid, the one who never raised his hand in class. Never unfriendly, just reserved, slow to give an opinion but full of them all the time. I loved to look at things logically and figure out how they worked, or how the things worked behind the things, or the things behind those things. I always found I was bad at expressing myself in speech, because my mind wandered so rapidly, making connections to things quickly. These connections in my mind made sense to me, but seemed foreign to others. Because of this I gained a fear of public speaking, and missed many days of school pretending to be sick. On the other hand, I excelled at writing short stories and prose. I could convey ideas easily through words, and the time it took me to write let me order my thoughts appropriately. Words on paper just made sense to me. Talking never did.

Then we get to the scary word. Silence. Not scary you say? Of course not why would it be. Silence is the resting point between words. The time to order your thoughts. It's calming, its soothing, it's sanctuary.  Free in your own thoughts. Needless to say (again), I didn't talk much. What was the point? There was too much chatter going on when all I wanted substance. But get me on to a point I'm interested in? Be ready for an earful because I've done extensive research and I'm ready to argue my point with facts and reason. For a long time though, I didn't have anyone to talk to about these things. And for a long time, that was ok. 

So it went like this, until grade 11 of highschool. I met my future best friend. We had the same ideas, same likes, same thoughts even sometimes. We grew and grew closer as friends until finaly, finaly, I had someone to talk to. Someone that was interested in what I had to say. Someone that I really respected, and trusted. This was hard for me. It wasn't a quick process but it seemed so worth it. The more he grew to know me however, the more frustrated he would get with my debates. I believe he only saw it as arguing, and he would get angry at me. This in turn, would make me angry and frustrated. Couldn't he see that I just want to understand what he's trying to explain? Why can't he explain it more logically, or more in line with my thinking? I didn't understand. 

Then I found this subreddit. Specifically, I stumbled across this link: http://www.carlkingdom.com/10-myths-about-introverts

I couldn't believe it, I had always heard of introverts, but this wasn't what I had been told. Only ever the stigma, the awkwardness, the shyness, the anxiety. This wasn't what I had learned. How had I come this far, without ever finding this out? 

I sat here, for hours, going over every reddit post, article, meme, anything I could find about introversion. My jaw dropped as people described me perfectly. Things that I could have never put into words, because I didn't know other people had this problem. I was broken, I had to be! How could I have grown up not know any of this?! How could there be other people like this that I could have talked to?! All of this worrying for nothing?! I had been mad at the world for so long, and I didn't know why! 

It starts to sink in. It starts to make sense. I put my emotions aside for a second and do what I do best, look at it logically. Finaly, I can put a word to this thing! Finaly, I'm not crazy! I'm not broken! I don't need to be fixed! 

I was overjoyed. I wanted to tell people! I sent the link to all the important people in my life. The last message going to my Mom. It was short, as heartfelt as I could be over text, and then added the link. As I hit send, the last straw finaly fell in to place. I broke down there and then. I cried the hardest I have in a long time. The emotional weight of thinking I needed to be fixed, suddenly lifted! It was too much for me to handle. 

The floodgates opened and released the final vestiges of my misunderstanding. I didn't need to change. I didn't need to be fixed.

No sudden trauma to justify my increased obsession with existentialism. In 3rd grade, I went to bed one night and felt something was wrong.

I loved the therapeutic effects of prayer in spite of my intuitive knowledge to its futility in all cases.

I stayed up all night thinking about death and what atheism meant.  That when you die, you enter oblivion, and the person you just were ceases to exist. That all of my accomplishments and ambitions are inherently meaningless because it only carries a brief and finite impact.

This led to a very unhappy childhood with decreased social interaction and night terror and theorizing about the transition from life to death.

Let me preface this by saying I am widely known in my family and friends as a successful, mature person who is older than his age, and seems to have everything together. I had a long heart to heart with my family a couple days ago and they all described how they wish they had my confidence.

If only they knew..

I'm 23 years old, I live with my brother in our apartment. I have a dog, I have a car, I have a monster PC, a killer home theater, all kinds of nice things and a job that promises to pay six figures in another two years. And all I can think of is how to get away from it.

As I mentioned, I had a long talk with my mother today about my future, and I mentioned how much I loathe my very ""normal"" life right now. She was surprised. She talked about how lucky I am to have such an awesome opportunity to make so much money, and have a nice job with serious stability. I agreed that I am very lucky, and that it would almost be a slap in the face to less fortunate people for me to squander the opportunity.. but, I'm just not happy.

For the past 3 or 4 years, I have been in a daily identity crisis. Every day I am asking myself how to make myself happy, and I just can't get an answer. 

Most recently, it was the idea of dropping my life and taking a job on a cruise ship as a paramedic. I'm drawn by the idea of meeting people from all over the world and being in a unique and foreign environment. My mother grounded me a little bit when I mentioned this. She knows me well enough to know that I will get bored with it and just as frustrated as I am now.

Her advice was to just stick it out, keep my IT job and use the money I earn to pay for cool experiences like travelling. I see the merit of that advice, but I'm just very scared of losing more time of my life. I feel like I've already lost 4 years of my life to the phony business world, and I've fallen into the traps of consumerism (buying crap I never needed).. and I'm scared I'll become another fat, stressed, unhappy American who has lost all grasp on what is important in life. Sure I could make six figures and buy a house, and go on 4 weeks of vacation a year.. but that doesn't interest me..

I imagine many of you have gone, or are going through this kind of thing? I feel like the only way I'll be happy is to keep changing and putting myself in new environments.

It gives us the light we need to see in the darkness of the cave, but it's the light that attracts the demons that hide within it. How do we understand ourselves in this world of harsh contrast, where calmness resides next to the chaos of our minds? 

Perpetually aware of everything that is going on, but pretending that it is not. How do we cross this bridge as individuals, and how do we go about understanding the world in which we reside? The world of the INTP is full of questions, we are in a constant need of understanding. It is our breath, it gives us purpose to life. Experiences, events, travel, they are all ways of diving into this rich depth of knowledge before us. We understand the necessity of absorbing everything, allowing ourselves to be sponges to the ocean of life. 

But what is this costing us as individuals? Where do we suffer as a consequence of this hunger for knowledge? It seems our personal relationships take a large hit, and we wonder why such a thing happens. We are clueless of it. We pride ourselves on knowing, yet this is something where we have no basis of understanding. We are lost, our map of knowledge is barren, and the desert sucks the very water out of our bodies. 

So how do we find this oasis in our minds? How are we able to connect, and make meaningful deep relationships with others that will truly make us happy, and make them happy as well? This has been my pursuit for some time, and yet it seems so far out of reach.  My heart is slowly being destroyed by my mind. We love our minds, but it is such a burden on our hearts. It takes so much out of us, and in its place puts so much pain. 

So we react to this pain, we try to understand it. We try to rationalize why it is there, but it hurts us so. You begin to understand why something like this arises, and that it will eventually fade. You use your mind, your knowledge, in order to understand it. But then it comes again, and it hurts to your very core. You feel it, and you fight it. And it comes again, but there it is. And your mind thinks of ways of understanding it, but you become lost in this turmoil of your mind. So I ask, how can we live with our understanding of our mind and our emotions? 

They seem so incompatible, with such calm and chaos, how are we to survive ourselves? How are we to understand and live with the world at peace?

The times during my day in which my brain is not seriously focused on anything in particular (e.g. - driving, walking to class, reddit, biking, sitting alone in my room, a lot of the day) I am usually thinking about philosophical ideas or trying to wrap my head around a new reality I've learned about the universe (quantum physics and things of that nature). And I love it. I often start philosophical discussions with my friends, and its a nightly conversation with my roommate.

After a while (a couple months) of this, I'll realize I'm philosophizing too much and I remind myself that despite our insignificance/meaninglessness in the universe I can still have the most happy/fun times I can and appreciate the part of the universe I know. That's what I try to live like every day, but sometimes its just not at the forefront of my mind (I still consider my self happy almost every day, because we are so meaningless, just not as happy/appreciative as I` could be).

This quickly leads me to being what I called ""clear headed."" My that I mean I live in a state where I'm not philosophizing between class or any other time of day in any significant amount. I feel like I'm just appreciating the moment.

This lasts for a couple weeks and then I'll be back to 'normal.' But its not just normal, I feel as if I've had time to refresh and rest before seeing what else mine and others' brains can think up.


Sorry for rambling.

Edit: I've come to decide (and the tests agree with it) that although I'm definitely an INTP, I have a fairly even S to N ratio.

**Edit 2:** *(very interesting)*

 &gt;The Ne-Ti axis also leads to a curious duality in the thinking of the INTP. The dominant Ti core tends to assume the role of a controller and organizer of his life, while the Ne behaves like a free spirit, almost childlike in its enthusiasm. The INTP tends to experience these two forces as an almost continuous tug-of-war, with neither ever quite gaining the upper hand. He is not disturbed by this duality and can view it with wistful humour. If he has been free-spiriting for any length of time, he soon feels duty bound to analyze his behaviour and systematize it. While if he has been in an analytical mode for a while, he will soon decide that he can do what he wants freely after all. It is a yo-yo situation. Generally, INTPs have a very strong requirement to keep their external, social world as simple and as uncluttered as they can so that they can focus as much energy as possible on their internal world of system analysis and theorizing. Hence, they tend to be amongst the least demanding and least complicated of all types when interacting with others. They prefer to let the world flow by: to observe the waves being made by others, but to make none themselves. When socializing, the Ne mode dominates, unless a discussion starts up involving the INTP in which case the Ti largely takes over. In their private world it is of course the Ti that dominates.

Bear with me, it's a long one.",35,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/19kpa9/diarrhea_of_the_mouth_im_just_going_to_dump_this/,"I was thinking about my childhood, and wondering how old I was when my creativity and all my thoughts became locked inside me, seemingly never escaping without dragging something awkward and personal and completely out of context along with it.  It’s a big reason for my social anxiety.  What will I let slip that “normal” people will find frightening, disturbing, or downright strange?  When did I decide that my own head was the only safe place in the world?

I never did well in school, socially.  My grades were awesome, at least until high school.  There were a few boys that I chased around on the playground in those early years of elementary school.  I told them that they were insects and I was a spider, and that I would eat their insides if I caught them.  My favorite boy to chase was my favorite because he retorted that he was a dirt-dauber wasp that ate spiders.  But he ran from me anyway because I was a girl.

The other little girls played together with their cute little dresses and…well, whatever it is that little girls do together.  I wouldn’t know- I was never invited.  In fact, I wasn’t allowed to wear either of my dresses at all, unless I noticed the upcoming picture day and told my mother about it.  Besides having the female plumbing, I may as well not have been a girl at all.

Other than entertaining little boys by pretending to be a tiny blonde predator, I spent my time largely alone.  I tamed feral kittens, caught bugs and dug elaborate miniature caves in my backyard.  I climbed trees and played in the mud.  And I was thinking, always thinking.  I wondered what happened after you died.  I wondered about God and Santa Claus and whether or not they existed.  I wondered if plants were aware of things around them like animals were.  When a cicada shed its horrific skin and left it on a tree trunk, did the tree know it was there?  I thought about the buildings I could build, if only I had thousands of Legos.  I didn’t, so I drew floor plans.  I invented useful things in my head as I fell asleep at night, only to discover later with great disappointment that someone else had already thought of it.

I did a lot of writing, just for myself.  I wish I had saved these early compositions, but I always destroyed them soon after I had written them.  The thought of my parents finding them absolutely terrified me.  They were not to know me.  They could not hope to know my mind, and for them to catch a glimpse of it was to have them inside my head, the one place where I could deny them access.  By the time I was old enough to write, I had already learned that my thoughts were my own, and to share them would result in name-calling from children and bizarre looks from adults, coupled with commands to sit quietly and not disturb others.

My love of knowledge always seemed to backfire on me.  It’s difficult for me to remember specifics because a lot of memories that I blocked out when I was young have not yet returned, but I clearly remember one instance in particular.

I was playing with a kitten in my front yard one summer afternoon, about seven years old, barefoot and free and intensely interested in the world.  A pair of boys came walking through the yard.  A few years older than me, a couple of Native boys from down the street- scrawny kids in baggy tank tops and flip-flops and hair shaved off but for the tiny braids on the backs of their heads.  Startled at the newcomers, the kitten started to struggle, and I clutched it to my chest and tried to soothe it.

“You’re molesting it!” one boy yelled.  “Cat molester!” agreed the other, as they walked past me and through the tree line, into the empty adjacent lot.  I stared after them in confusion, as the kitten squirmed free and disappeared under the tool shed.

“Mom, what does the word ‘molest’ mean?”  Reclined on the couch, my mother closed her book with her thumb in the pages to keep her place, and I saw a strange look on her face from where I stood in the doorway.

“Where did you hear that word?” she asked.

“I heard one of the neighbor boys say it.”

She looked thoughtful for a moment, almost torn.  “Molest means….to attack someone.”

“Okay.”

“Go back outside.  Your feet are filthy.”  She reopened her book, and that was the end of that.  Or so she thought.

A few days later, it was a rare occasion on which my parents joined us outside.  My mother was perched in a lawn chair with her book, and my father was manning the grill.  My older brother tackled me to the ground and sat on me. I struggled.  I was running out of breath.

“Mo-om!  Mom, help!” My cries went ignored.  “Mom, help, he’s molesting me!”  That caught their attention.  My parents’ initial shock turned instantly to fury.  

“What the fuck would you say that for?!?” screamed my father.

“You can’t talk like that!” my mother added.

“But…why not?  But it means attack!”

“I ever hear shit like that come out of your mouth again, I’ll wash your god-damn mouth out with soap!” my father roared.

I didn’t find out why I couldn’t use that word until I was eleven.

And that glimpse was just the surface life.  The public life.  The really awful things happened inside the house, away from prying neighborhood eyes.  And those are the things that I have had locked inside for years upon years, until my father left my mother when I was 15.  And then they turned into the things which started coming out in teary, hiccuping gasps to my closest friends, who I discovered were not really that close of friends at all, and I realized that I shouldn’t have trusted them so, nor let my grades slip just to spend time with them.  

After a few months, I had my emotions back under control, but I realized that I really was not capable of talking to anyone- about anything, really- without some unpleasant detail of my past slipping out without my realizing it.  I can’t seem to quite get the knack of compartmentalizing myself in such a way as to only let out the socially acceptable bits without locking things away utterly and completely.  

My mind had a dark box of secrets for so long that, once my father left, I felt I had no choice but to empty its contents back into my head and make them a part of me, accept them so that I could move on with my life without that dark cloud of shame and fear hanging over me.  

That was great and all that jazz.  It really took a load off of my shoulders, but it meant that I emotionally detached myself from the memories.  Now, the memory of cringing away from the two-by-four while my father threatened to keep one with a nail in it for discipline instead is exactly as emotionally distressing to me as losing the television remote.  If I have enough time to think about it, I’ll realize that I can’t talk about that kind of thing in polite conversation, but it’s hard for me because I don’t think I ever totally figured out what qualifies as socially acceptable conversation in the first place.  I’m learning from my mistakes, but every time I make a mistake, it causes the people I’m trying to communicate with to shrink away from me.  It has made me hesitant to talk to anyone except in text format, where I have time to carefully craft my responses.

Is this why the only one I ever truly wanted to spend the rest of my life with is a schizophrenic man, to whom nothing I say could be unacceptable?

If anyone has dealt with a lot of shit, developed diarrhea of the mouth and managed to figure out how to stop it, I’d appreciate your input.

But more than that, I would very much like to hear your stories, INTPs.  Tell me about your childhoods.  Did you grow up in a “conventional” home?  Did your parents listen to you when you talked?  Did adults tell you to sit down and shut up and do your homework like a good little drone, or did you win science fairs and math Olympiads and sell Girl Scout Cookies like a pro?  What were your favorite things to do as a kid?  How did the other kids treat you?  Do you have a box in the back of your mind that contains secrets that you are never going to tell anyone?  I’m genuinely interested in all of you, in how your childhoods shaped who you are today, and how you’re dealing with interactions in this grand, wide world.

2. To analyze a complex situation and develop a conceptual model to most easily understand, predict, and respond to it.
3. (optional strong preference) To not be managed or be responsible for managing others.

I would have to bet that many of you fellow INTPs feel you are doing the world a favor to teach some one something new, or correct their assumptions. How ever I feel like I come off as an arrogant ass at times. For Example; I attend(ed) Purdue University, and was up there meeting up with some old friends. One of my friends has a new girlfriend. We are drunkenly talking about nothing important. She says a phrase involving taking a noun and adding ""ed"" to the end of it to make it a verb. Everyone calls her out on it. Then she exclaims ""I am a Linguistics major! You can make up new words as long as you follow the set rules"" or something to that effect. I come back with ""And when you create a new word, that is called a...?"". She gives me a dirty look 5 seconds later when I tell her the word is ""neologism"". (ok maybe now is a good time to say I have a pretty good vocab) But still, if you are a linguistics major, I expect you to know that term. Anyways, her boyfriend (which is also my good friend) comes up to me and chews me out for giving her such a hard time. He felt I was just rubbing it in her face, when really I was just trying to teach her something new   So I feel bad and I want to try to avoid doing things like this to people.  
Another example; hanging out at a bar with this attractive girl my age, shes a smart girl for sure. Vet tech, knows her stuff. She says she has a headache, I tell her I have some NSAIDs in my car if she wants them. (They are just basic painkillers for those who dont know). She looks at me and says ""Do you even know what NSAID stands for?"" like I am some chump. I tell her the full definition and include examples, then storm off to find more beer. I was insulted that my knowledge was questioned. INTPs, you know that feeling. 

Oh man, I think I just realized that this girl did to me what I did to the linguistics major... It does not feel good... Not sure if I like the idea of hanging out with INTP girls....

Well this post has taken an interesting turn, sometimes it is refreshing to tell some like-minded strangers some details about my life. 

TLDR; was going around beating people at their own game of trivial knowledge. Then get called out for it. Then some girl tries to play me and I still win. Now I understand how it feels... not good.

I feel like my relationship with every single person is fake. If someone tells me something sad or what's upsetting them, I'll empathize with them and try and give them some wise advice, maybe a joke, but I usually just want the interaction to end and when it does it's gone from my mind. It makes me feel sick.

Let me give an example or two. Once when I was 12 or 13ish I was with my best friend of 12 years (friends since we were babies), he's more like a brother. And I was at his house, and his grandma died. We didn't see it but there was paramedics there in the next room, where she was dying. Everyone was crying and I gave him a hug and whatnot, but inside I didn't really care about was happening and just wanted to get the fuck out of there. And another time I was with a friend, alone with him in his bedroom, and he just caved in and started crying. Like really gut wrenching sobs. He was telling me he was going to kill himself and started cutting himself, right there. And I tried telling him it was going to be alright and don't kill yourself, etc. But honestly, I didn't care what he did, I just wanted to get out of there. 

And this happens for everything. I have emotional thoughts and feelings, almost constantly. But I never share them or express them. When a situation arises where most people would truly empathize or share their feelings, I just act sarcastic and mildly concerned and try and get them to laugh to ease the tension. The few amount of girlfriends I've had usually don't even break up with me, they just stop talking to me because I show so little emotions. One girl though, I really do care about and (think I) am in love with. But I didn't show it at all, I can't. I feel no one really knows me, not even my parents. I hide my feelings, my self, from anyone else but me. (fantasy world; see schizotypical)  

Sometimes I snap from it, usually when thinking about the formerly mentioned girl and how I ruined that, or what the hell I'm doing with my life, and just rage and punch a wall or something. But it's very rare.
I also have extremely bad paranoia, sometimes believing everyone I know is plotting something awful agaisnt me. I don't trust anyone that much, not even my parents.

I think I most likely am [Schizotypal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder) or [Schizoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder), but is anyone else like this, being INTP's? Or am I just crazy?

**tl;dr**: I'm unhumanly apathetic, paranoid, have low self esteem, uncaring/cold, solitary, etc, and am wondering if any other INTP's are like this. I read somewhere INTP's have the highest rate of the diseases I mentioned above.

Thanks, sorry for long bitchy rant.

No, but seriously, has anyone given thought to idea that we can ascend beyond our functional stacks and use all aspects of potential personality?

A little bit of background: I am an INTP and begrudgingly so (I wish I was more J, they get stuff done). I often question the validity of MBTI and social sciences in general, but I can't help be fascinated by the idea that people's behaviors are classifiable and predictable. Jungian cognitive function theory is a useful metric to shorthand people, but it has its limits.

So instead of using these ""limits"" to describe people, why not use the theory to go beyond the boundaries of our personality and become a sort of super ego, kind of like Maslow's self-actualization, where a person can become the ultimate most productive version of him/herself. I've been obsessed with this concept for a while now, but I think the idea crystallized after watching Limitless.

Basically, if you're an I and you're in an E situation (parties/gatherings), you could tap into E-mode and become the life of the party (I do this through inebriation). If you're perceiving and have some deadlines just use some judgment to reduce the unnecessary and concentrate on the task at hand.

My gf is an ESFJ and oftens tells me about obvious stuff I missed while talking with people. To me other people are weird, random and unpredictable. I find it difficult to read between lines and figure out what their intentions are.


Moreover, I'm almost never focused on other people - be it having lunch in restaurant, walking on the street or even hanging out with friends. It's like 80% of my mind is busy working on whatever is it is at the moment.


My mind does not like interruptions. I often answer people's questions without being aware of the question nor my own answer. Also, I have difficulties understanding quick inquries. This leads to frequent awkward situations.


Here's an example: I am buying a train ticket and tell the woman at the reception desk where I'm going. The conversation follows like this:

She: All right. Student?

Me: What? (I am very confused and can't come up with anything else)

She: Student?

Me: I don't understand.

She: Student?

Me: What?

After that she's visibly annoyed, cuts the crappy conversation and just proceeds. I felt like shit that day. And a retard.
It's obvious what the question means, but I can't explain why I couldn't grasp it.


While talking to people and sharing thoughts, sometimes I come up with weird stupid conclusions that seem to be logical only in my mind. Sometimes I just zone out or whatever and simply look retarded among my friends. It's quite embarassing.

All over Reddit and other boards, I see people reading something about the shooting and crying.  Or watching the news and crying.  Or...just crying all over the place for reasons I just don't understand.  People are almost literally flooding their keyboards with tears, it seems.  Most of these people have no personal involvement with what happened.

Now, I know most of these reactions are made up.  Or, at least I hope they only say they are crying because they don't know any other way to sympathize but logically, I cannot fathom why a person would cry for something that doesn't affect them.  

I do not remember these types of emotions being prevalent pre-cable/internet.  I can only surmise that now that we share an almost global consciousness, everything that happens that is news-worthy to the Western population is front and center to an almost nauseating level.

Personally, I do feel kind of bad about yesterday's events.  Yeah, the shooting sucks.  Yeah, it's horrible kids were killed.  Yeah, it's awful people are devastated.  Yeah, I'm glad it didn't happen to me.  But, that's as far as I go.  The thought of crying and being emotional over this event being far removed it seems...mentally ill.  I get it if an event happens and it causes you to think, or evaluate your life, moves you to action - but crying all over yourself?

Logically, why are these same people not crying for all the other atrocities in the world?  Is it because the media is not bombarding them with constant coverage?  There is far worse shit going down in this world than a guy that went on a rampage in a small town in Connecticut and killed 20 kids.  Far, far worse.

I tend to say absolutely nothing about about emotional issues because generally, people think my logical thinking and lack of outward emotion makes me an asshole, callous, uncaring.  I can just nod in agreement in a conversation and say, ""Yeah, it is horrible"", ""Sorry for your loss"", etc. and hope it's good enough.

(As persons whose personalities are usually heavy on logic, I figured it would better to post this here than in a more general /r .)  

**If you're personally involved with either the town or victims (or any other tragedy in this world), I truly am sorry for your loss and mean no disrespect with my post.  It must feel awful and I hope I never have to go through something so horrifying.**
  
EDIT:  So I just ran out to the store and there's people on the corner with candles and signs.  The signs mainly looked to be about getting rid of guns, peace and remember the children.  This seems to be a bit overboard - especially for a place that doesn't normally have people on a vigil or protesting about anything.

I've been to a few weddings in my life, but I forgot how alienating they can be, until last night. The bride and groom were friends, in the sense that we hang out with the same people and run into each other at parties often. They really are great people, but we've never hung out one-on-one, and I felt the same about most of the people I knew there. The reception was also dry, which didn't help things. There was a post-reception, for people who wanted to drink, but by that point I was too socially exhausted and ended up drinking a bottle of wine by myself at home instead.

While I was there, I realized how truly out of the loop I am, in some respects. To begin with, I don't understand marriage at all. In most cases I see, when people get married, they've already been together for years and are probably sharing an apartment at least, so nothing really changes. There is some financial risk, should the marriage fall apart, but there are also tax and insurance benefits, while they're together, so I suppose it's a wash. I'm assuming people don't generally marry for financial reasons though, or they would probably just elope, instead of spending thousands (at least) on a ceremony and reception.

What's even stranger still, to me, is people who get emotional at weddings; friends and family members who can't get through a speech without crying. Again, nothing's really changed. What makes this ceremony so important? I guess if you're especially into the bride or groom, you might be upset that (s)he's now off the market, but I doubt that's usually the case. I've seen two of my sisters and a handful of friends get married, and while I'm always happy that they found someone, that happened long before the wedding. I really just don't understand it, and the experience has a way of making me feel incredibly alone -- not so because I don't have a partner (and sometimes I do have a date for the wedding), but because everyone else becomes so invested in something I don't understand.

I'm completely clean and reliable, I keep myself to myself, everything is contained and then one day: wow.

Last night I freaked out at a friend because I completely didn't understand where I was with her, and hadn't for two years. We started out as good friends/drinking buddies, but she'd go months without answering calls, make plans and flake, turn up late.

I invited her round for dinner, but I got gradually more depressed and I tried to confront her on this but just fell apart and instead dumped all my worries onto her. She was in tears because she considers me one of her closest friends and had no conception she'd upset me or why. She was just busy.

So I apologised for everything and I asked if we could be friends and just hurt her more because apparently we were excellent friends already.

So it was horrible.

This has happened a few times in my life but always at the stage where I should be getting closer to someone. There always seems to be a step where I explain to someone why I haven't gotten close to them earlier and what held me back. I'm completely brutal.

Not many people get to the other side.

Often I feel like my way of getting clean with someone is to say, ""Hey, there are no longer taboo topics with me. These are the previous taboos. We can be honest. Let's not pretend.""

But there are so many situations when I let go of my emotions and then suddenly I go to some ultimate dick state from my previous super trustworthy reliable state. And often I'm just profoundly, deeply, wrong about everything about someone and one day it explodes.

Do other people experience this? How do you stay stable?

Also, I'm great at arguing, so I can convince people of my warped view on someone.

I am an INTP that has tons of friends, in fact I would say I'm quite popular in college, I am good with girls, I am smart - go to an amazing school and my family is somewhat financially secure (upper middle class). I enjoy my life and I am almost always genuinely happy. I have found that happiness seems to be a state of mind, and not fleeting as many say. I am genuinely always happy, whether by myself or around friends (and though I do sometimes get sad/angry,  this happiness does not leave).

The problem is that I know I may not be mentally stable. Outsiders would never guess this, but I have attributed it to the way I think. If something negative happens to me - or if my outlook on life for some reason changes, I feel as if I would over-think negative thoughts - leading to depression or mental instability. 

I thought about the way I think, and assuming other INTP's think in a similar way to me, I think it would be somewhat common, or perhaps more common than other types, for us to be depressed or have some mental disorder. 

What do you guys think? How many of you are depressed or feel they have some sort of mental deficiency? How mentally stable are you?

Note: I am not saying depression is a mental deficiency; notice I classed them separately every time I mentioned them.

I just turned 23 and I'm a male. Both male and females feel free to weigh in on this.

  This is what I would define as a classic INTP experience. I was at a pool hall with one of my few trustworthy friends upon arrival we are checked in and our ID's are checked. Anyone below 21 gets one ""X"" drawn on each hand and anyone over 21 gets a ""thumbs up"" stamp on each hand. When the female behind the counter or check-in desk(whatever you'd call it) stamped my first hand she grabbed my hand, as if holding it, for proper support when stamping(or else the stamping mechanism wouldn't do it's thing). Now, INTP mode activated. What happened next is a few things combined. One is that I wanted to make her job easier, two was because I had a special moment in my mind where I thought I could make the process more efficient, and three was because I wanted to avoid the awkward contact of this attractive girl I didn't know holding my hand. I would say it was equal parts of all of the above. What I did was slickly place my hand in a slight fist form on the desk/counter so she could quickly and easily stamp the top of my hand on a solid surface other than her hand... but what happened is she still went to hold my hand then stamp, which resulted in a half counter top, half her hand stamp. Which is fine. It went smoothly and was no big deal. Afterwards I thought to myself I wonder if she wanted to hold my hand or if she didn't realize what I was doing, or both. It was most likely she didn't know what I was doing. After reading INTP things all morning I thought this would be a funny little story. Any of you other INTP's have similar stories/thought processes.

From other threads and my own personal experience I've seen a few others mention being in or having been in long term relationships.

Myself, I see any relationship as testing the waters before you determine that spending the rest of your time with a person on this planet is the right thing to do.  Taking this perspective it only seems right to give any relationship as much chance as possible before deciding it could never work.

1370726315.0,26,self.INTP,1fy2lx,Distinguishing Feeling from Thinking and Emotion,29,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1fy2lx/distinguishing_feeling_from_thinking_and_emotion/,"I figured it might be helpful to make a post to help differentiate what these terms mean (in the Jungian sense) since sociolinguistic conventions can lead us to think of them in certain ways.

Jung, when he described the Feeling function, used the word feeling in an arbitrary way and was meant to be distinguished from emotions - which is what we usually think of when we think of feelings.

But emotions and feelings are different. Emotions are caused by, and show, physical responses - what we now know to be sympathetic responses like skin conductance, pupil dilation, rising of blood pressure, and so forth. Emotions, in other words, are those shows of aggressiveness, anger, sadness, etc., in physical ways. Crying and yelling are emotions (when genuine) because they cause physical reactions. 

Feeling in the Jungian sense, however, is simply a way to assign value to something. When I view an apple I can feel good about it, or I can feel bad about it. If I don't like apples I will feel bad towards them - ""I hate apples"" - yet this is not an emotional response. Jung himself uses the example that you can tell someone, calmly, ""I hate you"" without emotion - it is simply assigning that person a negative value - and in other words you are simply expressing how you feel about that person. Yet if you tell someone ""I hate you"" as you break down crying, that is both a judgement and an emotion.

It is important to remember, then, that the Feeling function is rational. Emotions are what we think of ""irrational"" so to speak. But because the feeling function is meant to assign value to an object it can become intermingled with subjective biases, and it is for this reason that it is contradictory to thinking - since thinking requires a certain amount of objectivity. If you want to think about the molecular structure about an atom you must address every individual aspect of that structure equally, and not get caught up in (feeling) thinking that only one aspect of it is important, or more important than the rest.

And it is because of this tension that primary thinkers, or as Jung calls them, Intellectuals, have archaic - or very primitive, blunt, and basic - feeling functions. Because they are used to viewing the world in a more objective way by having more control of their thoughts they become anxious by feelings. And what plagues Intellectuals are recurring value judgements, or feelings, that hold them captive. When this becomes extreme they are said to be 'invaded' as they lose control of their conscious mind. But this is another topic. 

What plagues Feelers, however, are recurring thoughts. On the extreme of this a feeler's value judgements will become plagued by these thoughts - a bad thing since they are not meant to go about by thoughts, but value judgements. This isn't to say one is better than the other, but only that when their archaic function begins to dominate they can lose their mental balance. It is why we have preferences for one over the other, and it is why we cannot be ""half T and half F,"" etc. 

But this isn't to say that because we are thinkers we should completely ignore our feelings, that would be an absurd thing - to get rid of our value judgements would be disastrous - since we all have them and we all need them. It is simply suggesting that when we are thinking about an intellectual topic fervently we will (if we are well developed) suspend our feeling functions to meet our current purposes (objective thinking) - to an extent. Putting our feeling function on hold for too long can cause us to lose grips and our control over them, and since value judgements tend to give rise to passionate emotions we can, as a result, also lose control of our emotions. And vice versa with feelers. 

Let me leave you with a bit of advice, then, and recommend that you introspect and learn to identify your value judgements from your thoughts - though this may be an extremely difficult thing to do - so that you don't find yourself with an overly archaic function and find yourself losing mental balance.

&gt;""But [intellectuals] are right to be afraid [of their feeling function] because their undoing will be in their feeling. Nobody can attack them in their intellect. There they are strong and can stand alone, but in their feelings they can be influenced, they can be caught, they can be cheated, and they know it. Therefore never force a man into his feelings when he is an intellectual. He controls [his feelings] with an iron fist because it is very dangerous.""

My SO is an ESTJ. An unlikely match to many MBTI-fans I suppose, but it works surprisingly well. We both appreciate our mutual sense of logic and we seem to value similar things in life. He helps me stay in the moment and takes me on adventures and I slow him down when he is wearing himself out with work. 

Him being a bonified planner has its both good and bad sides (I find it fascinating how he at one point booked us tickets for a theme night at a restaurant just casually walking down the street as soon as he thought of it). It has almost become a private joke between us after he set a ""cuddle timer"" when we were in a rush and I didn't want to leave until the last minute. 
Being with him has actually made me see the benefits of not leaving everything hanging in the air until a gun is pointed at your head, and I find that very rewarding. I've also taught him that last minute-planning can work just as well as planning months ahead (even though I'm confident that he still prefers his own method lol).

As far as emotions we are both a bit retarded, but my Fe against his Fi usually works well once we get the ball rolling. Although I prefer to avoid confrontation unless 100 % necessary, I'd like to think I am fairly good at letting things out once the flood gates are open.

""No, no, no!"" says the INTJ. ""Only some Scottish sheep are black."" The INTP rolls his eyes at his companions' muddled thinking and says, ""In Scotland, there is at least one sheep, at least one side of which looks black.""

I have no idea if this is the right place for these kinds of posts, but this one seemed the most appropriate, since it deals with ways of thinking. 
It might turn out as a long post, but I would really appreciate it if some of you took the time to read this :)

I'm a 19 year old guy from Amsterdam. Went to grammar school, just finished a year at a Dutch art school and I'm starting with Physics and Astronomy in a few weeks at a Dutch university. 

Since a few months now, my sense of reality started changing. My perception and consciousness somehow changed. I miss the convenience of how they used to be, but simultaneously, I feel like what I'm experiencing now is more pure. 

The everyday reality I'm experiencing gets a dream-like quality, like it isn't all that relevant or ultimate and it starts to fail to hold my attention. I used to enjoy these occasional 'mindgasms' but now it's like living in one constantly. It feels like I succeeded in my ultimate goal: understanding, or at least objectively percieving the universe, but I feel extremely confused at the same time.  I know this understanding-everything-feeling is bullshit, I've had this before and I lost that feeling soon enough at the time. 

As an INTP, I developed a sort of auto-pilot for social interactions which always worked surprisingly well, and right now it feels like the only thing keeping me functioning in the everyday world. It does a great job at covering up the fact that I'm feeling increasingly less empathy and motivation. 

It feels like it's a by-product of growing (scientific) knowledge and the consequences that brings for concepts like individuality, the universe, logic and the nature of reality, but this could be incorrect since it's presence seems disproportional to my gaining of these realisations. 

The biggest problem seems that I seem to be alone in this, and the fact that no one seems to acknowledge the absurdity of reality makes it all the more absurd. 
It's like I'm the only one who is blown away by the fact that there is something rather than nothing. 

It might be due to the fact that I think too much or that forcing myself into new ways of seeing things escalated into this. I smoked weed a few times, but only experienced positive, interesting and helpful thoughts. The last time was a few months ago, so I don't think it's related. 

I talked about it with my father once, and with my grandmother this morning, which helped a bit, but I'm still really hoping that someone recognizes anything like symptoms of a known mental condition or if this is just a boring, complaining, coming of age existential crisis. 

Thanks for reading, I know it might come off as whining, but it's severely bothering me. Any thoughts, advice, links or knowledge concerning this or how to enjoy everyday reality would be extremely welcome :)

I'm an ISTP, and somewhat of an INTP. I stumbled upon [/r/ISTP](/r/ISTP) only to find it for all intents and purposes dead. Then I hop over here and find r/INTP alive and well with over 1k readers. That got me curious. Here are some stats for the 8 Introversion subreddits:

Type | Age (yrs.) | Readers | Posts | [Estimated prevalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator#Type_dynamics_and_development)
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
[ISTP](/r/ISTP) | 2 | 17 | 2 | 4-6%
[INTP](/r/INTP) | 3 | 1484 | 24 (past 2 months) | 3-5%
[ISTJ](/r/ISTJ) | 2 | 28 | 1 | 11-14%

[INFJ](/r/INFJ) | 2 | 78 | 15 (past 2 months) | 1-3%

Now assuming the Introversion types are as proportionally represented on Reddit as they are in the general population, I see two trends:

* Without exception, the Intuition subreddits are vastly more popular than their Sensing counterparts, despite the numbers not being in their favor (especially for the Judgment ones)

* The Thinking subreddits are generally more popular than the Feeling ones

I don't have any background in MBTI, but the second trend sort of makes sense to me (the T's are more likely to think about their type). For the first trend, my hunch is that N's are better able to intuit the existence of a subreddit for their type in the first place. I first tested my MBTI years ago, and I've thought about it sporadically since then, but, perhaps with me being an S, I didn't find out about these subreddits until one was mentioned in a cross-posted link. How did you N's find out about your subreddit?

1372548055.0,26,self.INTP,1hc3ks,"INTP girl feeling lost and financially broke due to INTP issues, in need of advice from experience.",38,12,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1hc3ks/intp_girl_feeling_lost_and_financially_broke_due/,"I guess the purpose of this post is to understand how other INTPs deal, because I just feel too overwhelmed and sometimes underwhelmed with my life right now. So here's my situation:

I am 20 years old living in Chicago with a boyfriend of 2 years. I don't really have a real job, which puts a lot of stress on us money wise. I mean I am able to cover my portion of the rent, care for my cats (3!), and cover my basic needs, but that's about it. He is always wanting to go out, which results in spending money, which I simply have no interest in or have anyways. I know he is starting to resent me for this lack of money on my end, but I just cant seem to find the words to explain why I absolutely HATE working with other people, and going ""out."" 

I have had steady jobs before, as far as teenage jobs go (mainly food industry or serving, UGH) and have always done well at them, usually being promoted to shift leader or training positions shortly after hire. Even though for some reason my employers always LOVED me, I was simply miserable. I hated the work even though it was easy, and I hated socializing with the (to me simple minded, although I'm aware that's a harsh judgement) co-workers and superiors. It seems so ungrateful, knowing how many people would kill for a job, but I just could not bring myself to continue with any of these employers for an extended period of time. So as of now, I just make ends meet by photography, selling my paintings, tutoring an autistic boy, donating plasma, and other random odd end jobs and gigs. When I'm not ""working,"" I usually just stay home, play with the cats, read and research various things, and watch movies. I also workout at home.

I'm fully aware I will never have any substantial income living like this. It doesn't really bother me, but it worries my boyfriend, family, and ""friends."" They all think I'm unmotivated, which I suppose is true. 

I went to art school for a year but dropped out. I definitely don't see me going back to school. The only type of serious career I can see myself in would be in the fields of art or writing. I have so many abstract thoughts I wish I could share. I have started so many projects (visual, mixed media, written word, etc) but can never seem to finish any. It's a real problem (I'm sure you all know how that goes!), which makes me think any type of creative career will never be realized. Our apartment is littered with unfinished works. To me it's beautiful, almost like the apartment itself is a type of statement/self portrait, but in reality it's just clutter that nobody understands.

As far as my personal relationships go, I feel very much alone. I love my boyfriend and I know he loves me. We care deeply for each other. I just feel like we are on separate tracks that run along side each other. I don't think he fully understands my reasons for anything or my thinking process. Family relations are not good, as they never were. Friends are few and ungenuine. The internet, books, and animals are my saving grace. I am super passionate about animal rights, and am vegan. Spreading awareness about animals rights is what I'm most passionate about (I make posters and flyers and spam Chicago).

In short, though not particularly bursting my seams with joy, for now I'm content. I feel I live a morally sound life, but nobody seems to think that is important. Should I change my life, or continue this gypsyish life style, free of any major responsibilities, commitments, and limited interactions? Is it healthy? Am I drifting away from reality? Just fooling myself?

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this post. This may have just been a pointless venting session.. I am brand spankin' new to reedit, so sorry if this is not appropriate content. I guess any type of advice would work. Has anybody else had these kinds of problems and were you able to get over it? Snap out of the funk? How do you fellow INTPs deal? I would especially love to hear if any of you isolated yourselves from society for an extended period of time and were able to push yourselves back into the ""real"" world. Because frankly, I'm scared.

I don't feel like I'm something extraordinary, yet I'm apparently doing all these things that people are impressed with and I don't get it.

And even on the opposite side. One time I had someone say to me, ""Pyromine, I don't understand, if I had to deal with half the shit you do, I'd go home and cry every day.""

I try to look for people who are fairly straightforward, or at least respond well to that. I tend to find the courtship dance to be pretty wrote and unnecessary. Think John Nash's comments in the picnic scene from *A Beautiful Mind*, though not necessarily relating to sex as he was.

I also like to find people who are unpredictable without being batshit insane. People who are entirely transparant can be fairly boring; it's nice to have a surprise now and then. I tend to be more attractive to artsy-types, probably because it's a form of expression that I'm not super in-tune with myself.

I avoid insecurity at all costs, though I find myself inexorably drawn to it. Or it to me. I don't know. I feel a compulsion to try to ""fix"" it, which is impossible 99% of the time, and essentially means that the other person will constantly sabotage themselves while I watch helplessly. That is a profoundly frustrating experience.

I've had two long relationships. One with a girl who was pretty laid-back and otherwise fine, though I knew I had no future with her, and felt irresponsible with regards to her letting it go on any longer. The other was with a girl who was cripplingly insecure, along with other issues. I probably stayed too long in an attempt to ""fix"" or ameliorate it in some way; she had a lot of potential that never actualized itself.

Note that unintelligent is a very broad term, and open to interpretation; I just needed a placeholder. I'm aware of the lack of sciences behind these personality type classifications, but it seems that a properly diagnosed INTP (where properly diagnosed may refer to a person who closely matches the descriptions of an INTP, or someone who took several different tests and answered objectively, I'm not sure honestly) will always be at least as bright as, if not brighter than the average population. After all, the main assets of an INTP are their ability to critically analyse and deconstruct an idea or a concept from as a detached observer, and process several different threads of thought simultaneously to infer an uncommon insight into something. 

Thoughts? I hope I didn't sound arrogant, because that definitely wasn't what I intended.

I'm curious as to how other INTPs see the world now that you have been through combat in a third world environment. What are your thoughts on PTSD?  How many of you decided to stay in the military after being in combat?  Would you do it over again if you had the choice?

I dislike the fact that my most relevant title is ""veteran"" (as opposed to Dr., teacher, computer geek, etc) and I have a hard time expressing what being a veteran actually means to me.  I never shared the mentality of most of my brothers-in-arms and since separating I don't feel like i would really fit in with established veteran groups the same way I didn't fit in with the Army and would love to hear a like minded assessment.

My quick answers to my questions (I'll expand in comments if asked):  

I think the ""third world"" aspect had a much more dramatic impact than the ""combat"" aspect.  After being in Iraq and living with next to nothing and seeing Iraqis living on even less then coming back to the states was a true shock.  Up until that point I never really considered how much we have and how much we complain about it.

I was diagnosed with PTSD after 33 months in country (over three deployments) and i try my hardest to ""out think"" my impulses and emotions.  For me, PTSD is noticable only when my emotions take control of rational thought.  It's easier than before combat to make me emotional, and my highs and lows are much more pronounced.  

I got out after my third tour to Iraq and we were already getting ready for the next deployment.  I enjoyed the easiness of military life, and I would have loved to have a full retirement at 39 but I felt like A) I had pushed my luck far enough and B) My mind wouldn't be able to take another tour without completely turning in on itself

I would absolutely do it again.  Without seeing what I saw, i doubt I would have much interest in many of the things I enjoy learning about now (geopolitics, socioeconomic issues, corruption in government and a number of other ""WTF are we doing"" type concerns) and i feel i would still be just another one of the sheeple too distracted by televised sports and video games.

I dont feel like this post is quite what I intended it to be, but it's close enough and don't feel like rewriting it... feel free to ask for clarification or to add whatever you feel is relevant.

There have been many times, even in the last year, where I've initiated some sort of hang out with a new person (trying to be more social, looking to make connections, blah blah), only to be barraged by incredibly heavy details about their personal lives. 

The latest example of this is someone I started exercising with. He ended up telling me about his painful history of sexual abuse and family instability, but it was only second time we'd hung out! We'd worked out and decided to have a beer afterwards, and somehow the conversation landed on all this fucked up stuff that happened when he was a teenager. I did my best to be attentive and supportive, but at the same time I felt very uncomfortable by the conversation because I really don't know him well at all. What happened to him is tragic, and I completely understand the need for support with something as life-altering as sexual abuse, but I also find it alienating to dump such weighty material on someone you don't know very well right from the get-go.

I talked about this with one of my good friends, how I've often run into people who braintoilet me (I got the term from Better Off Ted, which is a great show btw) very soon after getting to know them. She said she's always thought that I'm a really good listener, which I've heard is a relatively common attribute of INTPs, and that I seem like a safe person to talk to, but shit! It always seems to throw a wrench in the works in regards to developing new friendships, because the balance of personal disclosure is thrown off so early. I truly don't feel comfortable sharing personal stuff like that until well into a relationship (romantic or platonic), and the ease with which these people seem to dish it out is really unnerving. It's like they're somehow challenging me to a ""whose life sucks more"" pissing contest. Perhaps it's coincidence, but the number of times it has happened suggests otherwise. Before this latest incident, a girl I met at a party a little while back talked with me for a half hour about how her ex-boyfriend had raped her. Maybe I just have ""bummer filter"" written all over me, but that was the worst party I'd ever been to.

Has anyone else had this type of thing happen to them? I hate to do a DAE-style question, but I started thinking last night about whether or not other INTPs have experienced this so I thought I'd ask.

That being said, I had delayed speech as a child.  My first words were when I was 5-6 years old, my parents don't remember my exact age but I remember the moment as a movie in my head, I remember it better than yesterday.

I was at the zoo with my parents and sister and we were standing around after lunch talking about what to do next, my parents tried to include me in the discussion and asked me what I wanted to see.  My sister always spoke for me and answered to them that I wanted to see the giraffe.  I didn't want to see the giraffe, they told her, ""Now Sister, we asked Younger Sister what she wanted to see.""  They all looked at me and I glanced around and saw a sign with arrows and names, I read the sign and said,""I want to see the Hippopotamus.""  My parents were surprised but my dad took me to see the hippo while my mom took my sister to see the giraffe.  My dad asked me why I didn't start talking until now, because at this point I couldn't shut up about the fucking Hippo.  I answered to him,""Because I didn't have anything to say.""

I told someone this story once and they laughed and said that Einstein had a similar story, he took a long time to talk and when he did it was to say something about the food being too hot (or something, I can't find where I read it and I am unsure what it was exactly).  When asked why he didn't start talking he replied,""Because up until now everything was fine.""

I understand now that I didn't talk because I would escape into my head all the time, I never came out as a child because there was no need for me to control or participate in my environment.

I understand that there is a theory about The Einstein Syndrome and no, I am not saying that I am gifted or that I had the syndrome, or that I put great faith in the theory.  Only that I believe my INTP personality might have a lot to do with why I personally took so long to start talking.

Ive seen this stuff before but never thought twice about it.  This time, however, I decided to click the comments and I saw someone mention /r/alternativeart.  After browsing the sub a bit, I didnt hesitate to subscribe and went about my day.

**Today:** So after waking up today and entering my Morning Random Thought Shower trance, the genre of alternative art popped in.  I started thinking about all the pieces I really liked and what an interesting genre i thought it was.  But just enjoying it for what it is, is clearly not enough, I must wonder *why* I like these paintings.  So after a few moments a came up with ""patterns"" being the culprit.  The only thing I like more than discovering a pattern/connection is finding new information that breaks the pattern.  So seeing these characters in a completely different setting, perspective, and context was exciting to me as it breaks my preconceived notions (aka pattern) about them. 

Problem solved, right? Nah *lets go deeper*. Now I must think about patterns themselves.  I acknowledge my own personal pattern which consists of being interested in things that break a pattern, mainly because there is a potential new pattern to be made.  But would it be paradoxical to not enjoy a broken pattern while simultaneously breaking my own personal pattern and enjoying that experience?  Is it really a paradox?....

Lol, I chuckled at how completely asinine this was becoming and stopped myself there because one could easily become lost in that thought process and take a 3 hour shower.

They smile and use a ""nice"" tone while simultaneously trying to exert their will on to you to get their way.

This bothers me so much because I detest social norms to begin with but I also don't enjoy being an asshole to people simply because I will feel like shit about it later.

In everyday life I typically avoid and/or ignore these types of people. Ill go along with it for a minute then just do what I intended to do to begin with.

But work...really any environment where you can't just completely ignore someone or just tell them exactly what you think...is different. With managers, what can you really do? As long as they don't cross a certain boundary I just swallow my pride and just take it. Occasionally I blow up on them though. Not strictly as an emotional outburst, but mostly with a razor sharp tongue.

With co-workers I tend to just be dismissive and use ""active assertion"" by bluntly stating what I think without sugar-coating social niceties into my response. Obviously this comes off as arrogant, which brings me back to my dilemma. I have certainly isolated myself at work but not because I think I'm better than everyone, it's just that I don't want to come off as anything ""asshole-like"" but at the same time: leave me the fuck alone asshole.

For as long as I can remember I've been vaguely dissatisfied by life. But in the last maybe 10-15 years I have noticed a hopelessness creeping in and it seems like my moods are getting worse. Nothing severe and I know that there are people out there with far worse problems than mine, but I have to think that life could be better if I was able to hit on the right solution.

So basically I am bored with almost everything. When I was younger there were lots of interesting things to learn about and experience and I did them all and liked them....until they became boring. The normal INTP experience in other words. Now I'm 40 and I've basically grown bored with every subject and activity that even sounds remotely interesting, because I've already done them all before. Dozens of subjects and dozens of activites are no longer exciting. Anything you might suggest will cause me to either say I've done it, not interested, or even if it sounds interesting (unlikely) it won't be in a month when I've exhausted it like I have everything else. Why even try? The only things left that sound interesting require large amounts of money, or extensive social interaction which is taxing and unfun to the point of nullifying the positive aspects. So I sit around on the weekend and spend my time trying to figure out what to do and coming up with nothing. Just going through the motions with my family.

Tried tons of antidepressants and nothing has worked. I test borderline for ADD-inattentive but haven't tried any medication for that. Doctors think I am just mildly depressed. What do you think? How can I gain enjoyment with life and get some desire and motivation to get out and do things?

I was a student that was great at all the subjects except math and could never turn in a homework assignment. So I skimmed by on C's and D's. 

After 8th I was thrown into a public highschool with a very different set of skills  than the regular kids and at a different learning level, on top of that I am/was pretty ADHD. I failed out of most of my classes and a couple months into 10th I dropped out.

Since then I've been enrolled in an independent study program doing a few hours of school work and turning it in once a week, reading any books I can get my hands on, kept a small group of 3 or 4 friends from high school and spent countless hours on the internet, but still all I want is to get out of public schooling and can hardly get myself to do the school work and I soon could be facing truancy because of the lack of work I turn in. 

I'm just not sure if I'm alone in this or if it's standard INTP life. If it is average what am I supposed to do? My life just feels like a loop of dread ending and starting with me turning in a little bit of work to tide my teacher over.

Before I start, I think I'm more of an INTJ but I usually score very very borderline. I think this issue I want to ask about is much more prominent among INTPs, so I figured it would be a good place to post here.

Anyway, I have very high standards for my work. Extremely high. I suffer from the belief that if there is a certain level of ""good"" that I can achieve, there's no reason that I shouldn't work to achieve it. I should note, by the way, that I mean this only within things I'm passionate about. In high school, for instance, I was well aware that I could get much better grades by actually studying every once in a while, but I just didn't give a shit and I knew the grades I was getting were ""good enough"" without the effort. So I didn't put in any effort, because I could survive without it.

But now, at this point, I think I became a person with standards that are inconsistent with how much work I'm capable of putting in. My exact example is that I want to draw comics, mostly stuff inspired by manga and I'm very passionate about this, and extremely serious. So I want to work towards this goal. I really do. I want to say, fuck everything else, I'll just draw all fucking day and I'll be good enough.
I'm a pretty big believer in hard work regardless, I don't think there's much you can't achieve with hard work. (Assuming you're from a relatively privileged background, of course. If you live in a third world country and want to draw manga, your mileage may vary.)

Yet even though I believe so strongly in hard work, and I'm really passionate about the idea of dedication and giving it everything I've got, I just can't do it. I don't know why. It never works. I just sit down, start drawing, and then get distracted.
My dad is a hardcore ISTJ that is capable of working for weeks straight with no breaks aside from meals and sleep. So I asked him about it, and he said that I need to cut out distractions or have some sort of schedule. Like, wake up early, work this much, and then I can do other stuff.
I tried that. It never works.

I know it sounds pathetic, but I can't bring myself to do it. I don't have the willpower. It's horrible procrastination even though in terms of my values, I am really against this behavior. I keep distracting myself and hate myself for doing it, but I keep doing it.

I guess I should point out that I'm not *that* bad, I do get like at least an hour a day of sheer practice. But I'm 18, I finished school, I live in Israel right now so enlisting in the army is next and there's no university until after that. My enlistment is in December, so that means I have three months of free time to work at it as much as I want. Why can't I bring myself to treating it like a job, and working 8 hours a day? I want to make products I can be proud of. I want to start actually drawing comics, not just doodling. I started a lot. I wrote out a script, but I'm only four pages into storyboarding it (like doodling the exact comic, but without the effort, so all the panels and dialogue and shit are planned out) but I get lazy and I can't bring myself to do it. The work's too boring, I think.

That's the thing, I'm really passionate about my ideas and what I hope to achieve as the end result, and I'm passionate about working as much as I need to get there, but I get bored upon realizing that this work I'm so passionate about is 90% thoughtless moving pencil on paper. So I try to challenge myself and come up with new projects, but again, it never works.

I remember a lot of MBTI tests ask whether you're more excited about starting projects or finishing them. I can never answer that, because I'm very excited about both. They're both extremely pleasing to me.
What I'm not excited about is the middle.

There's the idea for a new project -- you start it, you work at it and you're so happy because oh my god it's going to be so cool and creating stuff is so much fun.
And then you get bored. You start seeing how far your abilities are from making this project the best it could be, and you get discouraged. Realizing how far away the finished product is kills me. More than that, realizing that the finished product is not going to be what I want it to be kills me. I no longer feel the enthusiasm because the charm of the achievable greatness isn't there, I'm just working my ass off to make an 'okay' product. Another thing that disappoints me is that I'm not that good. I get embarrassed. I start realizing that even though hard work for the next five years could make me a god at whatever I'm doing, I'm still going to spend the majority of those five years being shit. 

This is how crazy it gets: I want to show my drawings here so that you can see and judge for yourselves and see where I'm coming from. Like, I'm this good, (link to my drawings,) and I really really want to be this good, (link to proper manga stuff.) But I can't even do that. Why? Because I'm fucking embarrassed. I've been working at this for the majority of my life, at least an hour a day, and my standards are too high to be happy with anything, even though almost everyone responds positively to my work, I cannot convince myself it's good enough. That's why I want to make something amazing and prove to myself that I am capable and I can do it, but I can't even do that, so I just excuse myself by coming up with an idea I convince myself is better, and then going for that project instead. After I realize I'd suck at that one, too, I just start over.

I'll give you an example when it comes to painting, which I should also theoretically be decent at since I've been doing visual art for so long. With paintings, the thing I'm worst for is the fact that the excitement of starting a new project is frequently a lot more engaging than continuing the current one, so when I paint I end up having ~15 canvases of half completed paintings, and ~5 canvases of completed ones. I don't even have any idea how I managed to complete the few I did, to be honest.

I think I sound like I feel large entitlement to stuff I don't deserve because I didn't work hard enough, right? And I don't know, maybe I do. But even if I do, I just want to make something I could be proud of, I feel like it's worth nothing and it's really frustrating. I apologize if this comes off as attention seeking, I just genuinely want help.

This really diverged from my main question, so:

**tl;dr: I feel very passionately about my goals and I want to do everything to achieve them, but this never works in practice. I try to sit down and do it, but the main thing I'm bothered about is that my work doesn't meet the standards I set out. I get discouraged, work even less, and by extension my skills develop at a slower rate and the cycle repeats itself.

*NTs often have a curious amorality related to the generally accepted standards of sexual behaviors.  The rules of society have little pressure for NTs, but their own idiosyncratic standards of conduct do.  These usually have been carefully considered, and are followed with or without society’s approval.  The sexual ethics of an NT are generally his own; they may or may not conform to the general morals of sexual behavior current in any given time.
Female NTs, in particular, are apt to have their sexuality overlaid with intellectualism.  Their preference for the logical can obscure expressions of their feelings, which may or may not be well developed.  If not, the NT female may have difficulty with orgasmic responses unless her partner takes the time, makes the effort, and understands the necessity of making a sexual approach through mutual exploration of intellectual concepts.  It is unlikely that an NT female will be sexually stimulated by a partner who is not her intellectual equal.  Male NTs have a somewhat different expectation concerning intellectual equality.  The preference here is for equality at most and some – but not too much – inferiority at best.  Obviously, this places the intellectually gifted female in a position of limited appropriate NT choices.*

I've been single for the better part of my life (ok, ok, I'm only 25 but still) but I mostly blame my desire for an intellectual counterpart and my refusal to settle for anything less. However, after reading this, I feel like my relationship future doesn't bode well!

As far as parenting goes i would have to agree with the INTP description on parenting, I encourage her to be an individual even at three and I teach her about the Universe and talk politics to her but I am sort of concerned about being a little too distracted and difficult to bring out of my head.  I also have the constant fear that I am making a big mistake but can't figure out what it is but I read that questioning yourself is an INTP trait.  
  The parenting thing just seems to be a lot easier than most people make it out to be, so far.  I was warned about childbirth and it was NOT a big deal, not nearly as painful as women make it out to be.  I was warned about raising a baby and again, not a big deal.

It seems like most people are skeptical to the idea that they may have adhd, I know I was, but I really feel that a lot of the struggles that people on this subreddit face seem to really mirror the kinds of problems that the great people over at /r/adhd  face. I think I finally understand why.  

I'd like to preface this by saying that there's a good chance that this doesn't apply to you, however, I'd like you to all objectively, rationally consider it. If only for a second.  

I went online and found a meyers briggs test, and only answered the questions that an adhd diagnoses would predispose someone to answer one way or another. Since adhd can bend pretty heavily between extroversion/introversion (In the way that the hyperactive type turns outward into the world for stimulation while the inattentive type tends to turn inwards for stimulation.) I answered all introversion/extroversion answers as an introvert would. [This is the result.](http://imgur.com/a/0rkIN) I feel confident that I can defend any and all of those answers.

So, I think that I'm onto something because the myers-briggs asks many questions that can be used to determine whether or not someone has adhd. Answers that someone with adhd would most likely give tend to spit out an INTP personality type. Therefore, someone with adhd is more likely than the average person to identify as INTP.

They will often force certain meaning on the text of the Bible to come to a conclusion that is positive and edifies them. As long as their Bible interpretation and worldview agrees with tradition and common Christianity, they are fine with it.

I am just interested in what is true, and I happen to have come to the conclusion that they Bible, understood correctly, is trustworthy. I would rather understand what the Bible is communicating than force some meaning on the text just to make some positive impact. I also have no respect for the authority of tradition and common Christian agreement. I also see in the Bible no promise for happiness in this life.

I'm rambling now, but I could talk forever about my differences with the average Christian.

As far as me reading is a huge thing for me, if I want to change I read about whatever it is I want to change.

I suck socially, so I read these books on body language to help me with that:

Basically I'm finding the whole college experience to be pretty disappointing. Freshman year was awful, sophomore year slightly better, and now midway through junior year I feel like I'm just holding my breath and waiting for it to all be over so I can get on with my life. I'm hoping that some of you who might have had similar experiences can give me some advice so that the next &lt;2 years won't end up feeling like a total waste of time.

First off, I go to a really big, densely populated school. My rational for accepting this at the time was that, even though I do better in peaceful, scheduled places, that's not how the world is. I figured I should put myself in an environment where I have to learn to be comfortable in groups of people because I won't (probably) have the opportunity to coddle myself once I'm in the professional world. Being at a big school is not entirely negative of course, there are a lot more interesting activities to pursue and I'm glad that I have access to those, but it is very stressful and energy-consuming for me to be around other people almost all the time.

Academically and socially I've gotten a little lost as well. I had a small but strong group of friends in high school, but I've had trouble establishing anything like that in college. It's gotten better, with persistence and practice I can generally make a couple new friends every semester, but whether I'm able to hold onto them for an extended period of time is another story. Again, it's something that I'm working on. I make a conscious effort now to think of fun things to do that I can invite people to join me in, but doing that kind of thing doesn't come naturally to me at all. I think part of the problem is that the people I am most attracted to as friends tend to be somewhat like me--at least a little on the introverted side, take school very seriously, and not the best at making plans. But, to be honest, I think the bigger problem is that I come across as pretty boring to new people. I don't consider myself a boring person, and people who I know well certainly don't see me that way, but it takes me a while (several months to years in some cases) to really open myself up to new people and let them see all the facets of my personality. This wasn't such a big problem before college because I had years to gradually build relationships with people; I feel like things move too fast in college to have an opportunity to do that. Sometimes it seems to me that the first impression is all you get, and I make somewhat lackluster first impressions. I've also noticed that it's very hard for me to make myself open and accessible to people when I have something else on my mind. When I'm stressed or my mind is preoccupied by something else, socializing pretty much falls to the wayside, and I pretty much always feel stressed or preoccupied. What especially frustrates me about this is that I genuinely like meeting new people and doing things with others--I just wish I could skip the whole 'meeting' part. 

It's my academic performance, however, that has 'hurt' me the most. I got good grades in high school, but I'm beginning to see now that that was mainly due to force of will. I'm gradually coming to appreciate the fact that I study hard...but not particularly well. I've always been a pretty ambitious student, and my goal when studying has always been to learn EVERYTHING. I'm very detail-oriented and have always been better at being thorough than being efficient. In high school this wasn't too much of a problem because the courses moved at a slower place, but now all the material I am learning is so dense and coming at me so quickly that I often feel overwhelmed. I long for a dose of INTJ-style pragmatism in these situations because I feel like I too often stick with the most 'thorough' studying methods, even if they aren't the most effective. I also have very diverse (I am pretty much continually thinking about changing my major) and ambitious academic interests and hold myself to very high standards, which only compounds these problems. And like others, I hate admitting that I don't understand something or can't solve my problems on my own, so I often only go to office hours or ask others for help as a last resort--again, not a very pragmatic solution.

I don't mean to make it out like my experience has been entirely negative. I like to think that with every semester I am learning more about myself and becoming better adapted to the world around me. But this whole experience has just been so much harder than I thought it would be. Not to say that I thought it would be easy, I just didn't expect that there was so much about myself I would have to overcome to be successful.

Well, after picking up and dropping sketching, poetry, songwriting, guitar, piano, cooking, and other skills along the way, I stumbled into electronic music production/recording a couple of years ago and it now commands the vast majority of my spare hours.  I'm often at my studio 8 hours at a time or more when I get the chance.  

This seems very un-INTP-like and I'm occasionally terrified that I will suddenly become bored with it (but so it goes!).  However, I'm extremely happy - which is an odd feeling - with the act of experimentation and creation, and intend to persevere.  It also occurs to me that the nature of electronic production (solo work, no real rules, lateral thinking is good thinking, computer stores all my WTF attempts for later use, etc) is particularly conducive to INTP workflow; perhaps this helps...

If you're anything like me, you may be absolutely OBSESSED with the idea of maximizing your usefulness to the world in life. As we all are aware, we INTPs generally live in our heads, and have constructed an immense universe, for which we create and manage the rules, etc. In my head, there has been a five year long epic war between two rivaling ideas:

1. Utilize my rare capacity to solve complex problems, and commit to making the world a better place, knowing that it may come at great personal cost, and may involve great sacrifice.

2. Throw my hands up in frustration at my species, become a cynic and give up all hope, and live out my life doing what makes ME happy.

This war has been an absolute stalemate for years. I have told myself that these two ""rivals"" are not mutually exclusive, but in so many ways they seem to be. Each would lead me down a much separate path in my life, and I have no answer.

Do any of you struggle with this? Are any of you like me, in that you play out every career scenario, every life decision, and your number one concern is how useful it will be?

My morals mean a lot to me. A LOT. I am very firm in my core values. I imagine most of you are similar. I do not make confrontation, and I do not put myself in the spotlight often, but when my morals are being questioned, or otherwise need defending, a dragon awakens and I mercilessly beat my questioner's argument into a pulp. I can go from 0-100 in a flat second, detailing all the fallacies of your argument, all your personal flaws, all your inadequacies as a human being, all the ways your position as an intellect is comparable to a 3 year old, and I can end friendships in a flash.

My morals and values, I revere. Anything else, I'm willing to be open minded, but on the things I consider my core truths, I am an immovable object. 

Are you guys like this? 

-----

As a bit of a sidenote, I have been a vegan for almost four years. One of my most sacred core values is to minimize the amount of suffering I cause during my life. Once that became one of my core values, I could no longer eat animal products. I knew I had no option but to become a vegan.

In the past, I have talked to other INTPs, and surprisingly I was not alone in becoming a vegan. Many INTPs, like me, found it was the most logical way to live, for many reasons.

Are any of you vegan? If you aren't, why not?

I have the constant sensation that I do not get my point across perfectly; even though I talk a huge deal when explaining complex ideas, I still feel that the human language (mostly spoken, but it also happens written) is very limited. 

We can only express ideas linearly, one thought after the other. My brain does not work like that: when I'm explaining something, I visualize a complex structure that represents the idea I want to get across and my ""spoken transcription"" is like an algorithm verbalizing the abstract concepts, and I must say I feel it doesn't work very well.

Sometimes I wish we could have a ""peer to peer cable"" for brains, where the ideas would be comunicated with all their branches and ramifications. 

Also, I usually feel the urge of modifying details after I have transmitted my ideas. I imagine other people would find weird having said to them ""hey, do you remember that time when we talked about cats? I would like to change what I said after..."".

The new shop has a floor to ceiling lift with giant arms and the compressor had a solid I beam welded on top of the tank, under the motor.  While everyone else was running around trying to pile up wood and cinderblocks on top of a floor jack to ease this beast to the ground, I just pointed out that the arms of the new left could easily grab the I-beam of the air compressor.  Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked dumbfounded for a moment, and then the giant compressor was unloaded a couple minutes after my suggestion.

I love being a human. I feel it is a supreme privilege to have the capacity to recognize beauty in the universe, and I feel obligated to push this vehicle of mind and body as far as it will go (creatively and intellectually). (I suppose this aspiration is more or less in line with Nietzsche's idea of the ""Ubermensch"") Anyway...

As i grow older, i find that i am more and more interested in observing the natural world (ie. thinking about mind, physics, music &amp; art, other ideas, etc.) and am gradually having less and less in common with the people i hold conversations with. I am starting to feel that the thoughts/conversations i hold which deal with popular culture are an insult to the potential of the human mind. In the title i mentioned 'shedding culture'. By this i mean that i wish to be free from extrapolations of the behaviors and base desires handed down to us from our primate ancestors, (the behaviors which developed to ensure survival and procreation) which contribute to jealousy, fighting, the need to impress and dominate others, etc. (The imprint of the ego on large scale human interaction, essentially)

I want to know what the universe is. I am painfully aware that even if there is such 'overarching truth' pertaining to what the universe actually is (or what it is doing) there is no reason to presume that humans (in their present state) have the capacity to understand it or that english can ever hope to encapsulate its essence. That being said, I think it is beautiful to aspire toward this understanding, and i feel that it is not something i can ever abandon.

I don't want sex. I masturbate a little to keep my general desires in check but apart from that I'm not a very sexual person at all.

I keep myself busy with gaming and building arcade machines. When I'm not doing that I'm working or sleeping. I don't feel like I could fit a relationship in my schedule.

My floor consists of 28 single rooms - 1 resident per room. So I have 28 residents total on my floor. The dorm I live in is made up of only single rooms and is known as the most anti social dorm (not really true, just all introverted students). After all, these people all chose to live by themselves for a reason. I would say 90% are introverted. It's an extremely quiet and peaceful residence hall. I love it.

But I have no idea how to get these people out of their rooms. And I have to, because it's like, pretty much the main part of my job - to create a ""community"" on my floor. I failed at it last year and don't want to again, I'll be fired.

Imagine you are one of the residents on my floor. You probably have everything you could possibly need with you in your room, and are content to be there with your things: computer, books, games, whatever. What would get you out of your room?

So I didnt start dating till university because I wasn't interested in any of the boys at my high school.  They seemed trite, immature, boring, and they lacked basic hygiene skills. 

Lost my virginity to an ESTP.  Everyone should date an ESTP in their lifetime - he was fun.  Probably one of the nicest, happiest guys I have ever met.  He was charismatic and outgoing, and a total adrenaline junky, loved to be a performer or the  centre of attention.  We're still friends, he was fun.  We dated for a year and a half untill our romance just sort of evolved into a friendship instead. 

 He is still his old self - is a popular gym teacher who has won awards for it in his local community, is a volunteer firefighter, does pyrotechnics for a hobby, sky dives, scuba dives, plays for a cover band on the weekends etc, etc, etc.  We both worked at a children's museum in the summer when we met.  He asked me out by making me a thing of cotton candy the size of three basketballs using the museums cotton candy maker.  ""this is for you.  wanna go out for icecream this weekend?""  He was fun but we lost our spark.  


Boyfriend number 2:ENTJ.  Studied Law (and his since graduated).  Was very smart and witty and outgoing.  Could charm his way out of a paper bag.  was one of those people who you are secretly jealous of because he is so busy all the time but gets so many things done anyway, somehow and always seems to have time leftover.  Was disciplined, had really nice abs.  

He was nice, but was a bit cold and it felt like something was missing for some reason.  was also a bit bossy and controlling at times.  He didn't understand why I didn;t want to be a workaholic like him.  He was addicted to achievement. 

ESFP:  was basically a monogamous fuck buddy relationship.  It was fun for about a year.  We had no connection beyond the physical.  Loved to party, was a little immature, but very kind hearted.  was a graphic designer.  

WORST date everr (lasted 3 dates only and it was only because I am open minded and like to give ppl a chance:  I think he was an ESFJ.  Holy crap, he needed a smack upside the head.

Just because you're an INTP now it doesn't mean you will always be an INTP, nor does it mean that you should continue to define yourself as one. Knowing your current personality type can be very helpful in your journey for self improvement, but it should not keep you tied to each problem or insecurity you already have. 
It's all too easy for us to band together as people who have trouble in social situations or feel drawn to certain things/activities. This distracts us from the entire point of the personality type classification. Identify your own strengths and weaknesses, take advantage of your strengths, overcome your weakness. 

Basically if you identify yourself as an INTP, you can easily fall into thinking you will always be an INTP. You leave no room for change or development. We are all better than that.

A few days ago I cried for several hours after having a fight with a close friend; I haven't cried at all in two years, and that was during a movie. I haven't cried due to events of my life in four years. I have a deeper appreciation for music and art-y things. I don't like math nearly as much as I used to, but I've only been sampling over a week, so I might've just hit a boring problemset?

Thoughts? (This is an obvious throwaway).

What makes you yourself today?

I'll go first.

I used to be a very religious person. This is greatly influenced by my mother's side of family. We pray before every meal and go to church every Sunday. My grandfather even established a charity and built a church in mainland China to improve the corrupted land. He is a tough guy, I miss him.

Anyway, as a result, as I've said, I became very religious. I never care about my appearance, always nice to people, offer a hand to the helpless. I'm not particularly a social butterfly though, all my friends are the ""needy"". I remember a scenario very well: my two friends once fought each other (literally grabbing each of my arms) shouting ""She's mine!"". Similar situations happen quite often. When that happens, I usually just run off, and if they ask where I'd been I'd say I went to piss. These were all in primary school.

Fast forward to fourth grade, a major incident happened and it changed my life forever. Basically, I had a quarrel with another classmate and did some stupid things and pissed off the whole class and became a loner eversince. It's not that I don't want to talk about it, but somehow I just can't recall the details now as if my brain has delete them to avoid me remembering those painful memories.

Never realized the damage done until now. In sixth grade I finally collapsed and tried to kill myself. However, unable to think straight, I ended up wandering in the streets while my parents went nuts searching for me. I came home 4 hours later, exhausted. I became an atheist eversince. (I'm now agnostic. You can never be sure, can you?)

Then I found the internet! It became a daily boost for me to go on. I eventually got into video games and made some friends (r/l) who are also gamers/INTPs. Recently I just left my homeland (HK) and study abroad here in UK. I had to say I hardly miss HK, except my parents. To me that place just reminds me of the stress and miserable memories.

I actually thought about what kind of person I want to be before coming here. Sometimes I became really tired of being a loner. You know that feeling. It's like I know how to make that step, the problem is do I really want to take it. I ended up being a loner here, as expected (since I'm such a dumbass), like I've always been. But you see, being a loner gives me more space to think. It's just that when you are a loner for all your life you sort of don't give a crap anymore and tbh I kinda like it.

Another reason why I stay in my comfort zone is because I fear. I fear that I make that step I'll just make myself a complete idiot and do something ridiculous, like I did in fourth grade. I fear that perhaps I'm not that ""smart"" afterall, the mysterious feeling I appear to people by keeping everything to myself is the only thing that is making me ""smart"". If I break the silence I fear everything I own will be lost.

I don't know if any of you watch House M.D., but if you do you know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, I'm such a big fan of the TV show that sometimes I suspect I'm deeply influenced by it without knowing. I even want to become a doctor when I grow up.

(i'll try to be succinct, but it will still be lengthy to explain)

My last relationship was with this girl who was an opposite type of personality. She's emotionally minded, enjoys music and dancing, has a strong personality (fiery redhead sort of thing). She initially didn't think she would stay in contact with me after the convention that we met at, but we ended up dating. Conflicts were pretty normal with us through the relationship, usually because communication broke down between the logical and emotional sides of us. Usually over messiness, romantic gestures falling short of what she wanted, me not being able to appreciate music in the same way as her. Sort of INTP normal problems from what I gather. 

**I ended up cheating on her almost the entire relationship, she found out, that was it. Here's the chain of logic that led me down this shitty path. ** 

About 2 or 3 months into the relationship, she was unsure of whether she wanted to date me or not, and she would voice this on an almost weekly basis. This totally screwed with my emotional state (that I at the time was content leaving in a little box and ignoring), and made me hurt, angry, frustrated. My ex was visiting me one weekend and things started to get a little weird. I knew I should get up and get some air, and make sure nothing would happen. But then I reasoned, I was pretty sure the relationship between me and the current girl wasn't going to work out, she was being terrible to me emotionally, if something happens maybe it was for the better. I had previously used this same logic before and it worked out for the better I reasoned, so maybe this wasn't a bad thing. 

We ended up sleeping together, and I was like, ok, well this is validation I need to break things off with my girlfriend. Except I never could quite bring myself to do it, always putting it off for the next day. A month later I realized that my feelings for this girl was winning out, and I really didn't want to break things off with her. Which put me in a problem spot for what to do. 

I did the next instinctual thing and researched the problem on Google and reddit. The results that came back was that the truth on cheating always comes out eventually, even if it's years down the line. My ex also hated the girl I was with and had her number, so it was really easy to see her drunk and lonely one night and just feel like texting my girlfriend something. 

**I should just tell her then, and hope she could forgive me, I reasoned.** After probing the whole cheating issue with my girlfriend in hypotheticals, her answer was always the same. I would instantly break up with that person and never ever be with them again. That was a terrible answer for me to swallow. I really liked the girl, maybe even loved her, and I didn't feel anything for my ex at all. It was a stupid mistake, but she wouldn't see it that way. 

I tried to put it all behind me and forget about it, but the fear and anxiety was terrible. I never knew whether the next week, next day, next hour she would walk up with a text message from my ex and it would all be over. I would no longer be able to be with this girl I loved ever again. But what other choice did I have?

That question lingered in my mind for another week until I came up with something. I could continue to be friends with my ex, be a really good friend in her life, and tell her how I felt about the situation and implore her to not ever speak of it out of respect for me. That might work, I reasoned.

I went to see the ex (lives in a nearby city) to hang out with her. She wanted me to act more like a boyfriend than a friend, I kept it platonic. (She was still in love with me, I broke off the relationship with her...). At the end of the night she was in tears, because she wanted more from me, and couldn't be around me if I couldn't give that to her. 

Time froze in my head. I could go home, try to be friends with her over the internet which probably wouldn't work, and be stuck in self generated fear about when she would inevitably tell my girlfriend. I could tell my girlfriend now (2 months later), but there wasn't much chance to begin with that we'd still be together because of her views on cheating, and that 2 months had passed made it that much worse. Or I could pretend to be what my ex wanted me to be. I reasoned the first two options I had already been considering for the last two months and I already knew what I had already decided. I apologized to my ex, we ended up sleeping together again. 

Over the next few weeks I tried to figure something out, meanwhile texts from ex kept coming in. Eventually I decided to tell my ex that I still had feelings for her, but the feelings for my current girlfriend were stronger and that I wanted to see where the relationship was going. Keep her close but don't lead her on that i'm going to break up with my girlfriend. We might break up next week anyways, I reasoned, she was totally frustrated with my absolute ineptitude of emotional displays and messiness, the situation might resolve itself. 

Months passed. I really truly was completely in love with my girlfriend. Us breaking up seemed like less and less of a probability. The ex would get angry if I didn't come visit her (and act like her boyfriend and sleep with her) every 2 months, so that was still going on. This couldn't continue, I needed another way out. I went back to thinking. 

My ex valued long term commitment more than anything else. If I could go to her and tell her with absolute resolution that this girl would be in my life for a long time, that I loved her and that this thing needed to stop, she might respect it enough. Respect it enough that years down the road if she was hurt and upset and drunk she wouldn't send a message to clear her own conscience. It was a way out that I could maybe live with. I needed another few months to be that resolute, I chose to wait. 

But something interesting happened. I was already there, I just didn't realize it at the time. I proceeded to continually cancel and reschedule hanging out with my ex, because frankly, I *really didn't want to see her*. She eventually got mad and texted my ex that I cheated on her. I went with playing it off like my ex was jealous and in love with me (true) and that she made it all up (what else was I supposed to do, the truth should have come out months before if I was going to tell her). She eventually bought it, we were back together, I thanked whatever invisible gods there were out there because I could finally be free of this mess. 

...I called my ex to ask why she did told her. She said it was a conscience thing and she wanted to be free of the secret. **At least I didn't give her hard evidence, I still have text messages I could send her.** My heart sunk. I was still trapped in this nightmare of my own creation. 

Eventually I went on a vacation and she was at my apartment. My computer screen was on and she happened to read a message, which led her to scroll up and see all the lies I told my ex to keep her around. She was crushed, I cancelled the vacation and came back immediately. Came completely clean with her, but it didn't matter, she had insight into what she thought was the truth (my facebook messages) which was really lies to my ex. 
-------------------------------------
**Aftermath:** I've spent a lot of time analyzing everything that happened. I was too immature to have good enough morality or wisdom to not have cheated on her in the first place. My logic compounded the problem exponentially. Normally this would have been caught by my friends, but I never told them, because I couldn't. Without someone elses viewpoints to take into consideration, I couldn't see that it was unfair to her as a person to not tell her. I never wanted to hurt her. I was completely and utterly in love with her. I still am, more or less. If I was more connected to my feelings I would have chosen differently as well. I would have been effectively much wiser with the whole situation. I see that now, I didn't then. 

**I've come now to view my personality as an INTP to be one of the greatest gift and one of the worst curse you could ever possibly have. The lack of emotional development is something you can develop, so it's not hopeless, but logic by itself is a trap. You might (and probably will) be very successful with material objects and hedonism, but it never will answer the question of what makes you happy or align your actions with your desires. I wanted to marry that girl and be happy with her. I ended up hurting her in the worst way possible, because in a view of the world with just logic, your logic might run over your feelings in the process. **",,False,,t5_2qhvl,False,,,True,t3_1dcupy,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1dcupy/my_last_relationship_and_how_logic_can_totally/,

If so, how have they affected you?",22,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1blo4c/is_anyone_else_here_on_antianxietydepression_meds/,"For about 4 months I've been taking the SSRI Citalopram (20mg), and it has changed a few things in my life for the better. Before taking the drug, I have to say my life wasn't at rock bottom. I was never suicidally depressed, I functioned at a mediocre standard and if there was something I had to do it would always get done. I was your typical melancholy guy, following life's path convinced everything was okay because I had no apparent problems.

But that was the problem. None of my problems were apparent. I had always convinced myself that there was nothing wrong, when in reality there was just enough wrong with me for me to be hovering below that metaphorical boundary. What plagued me was my cluttered mind, that would always drift off into unnecessary thoughts. It fuelled my lack of motivation and anxiety, which would lead to periods of depression. Even though I knew the thoughts I had were pointless/unwarranted no matter what direction I drew my mind towards, I just couldn't get out of that desert highway to no mans land. Occasionally I would have a good day and I would remark upon how I should feel like that everyday, an exercise in futility which was always more hopeful than practical. I would say about 70-80% of my life for a few years was spent below that metaphorical line. Life was acceptable and complaining about it was sacrilege to me, but none of the good emotions were there. No joy, no wonder, no spark. It felt like I'd hit a dead end at life and that was it. That was how things were. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't suddenly arrive at drugs as the solution, the idea had been loathe to me for many, many years. I always assumed only people with the highest of mental problems took them. No, with varying degrees of success and failure I tried; exercise, being more social, talking profusely about my problems (with different people who I trusted), changing my lifestyle, learning something new. Etc, etc. The one which had the most effect was the exercise, but it's hard to go to the gym frequently when your brains telling you to stay in bed. The one which backfired horribly was of course, being more social. You can't be more social with other people if you don't love yourself, and if you don't give a shit about the conversation at hand. Talking with other people was liberating... for about a week, until you realise that nothing's changed. Lifestyle change did fuck all, although having short hair compared to long is much more practical. I finally decided to try the drugs after doing some much needed research on them and realising that I had been unhappy for the past 3 years.

From my perspective what the SSRI has done is uncluttered my mind. My mind will still follow tangents occasionally, but I am able to change the thought process now almost at will. You know how our minds work best linking abstract concepts together? Well that's improved by a hefty margin. It feels as if my mind is now more organised and running smoothly. For example, I was able to write this goddamn piece of text with minimal editing (for better or worse), and I managed not to drift off trying to make hundreds of relevant points. Something which would have seemed an impossible task 4 months ago. Another improvement that has come about is social situations. The anxiety is much lessened, and I no longer feel as if I'm one step behind or three steps ahead of the conversation, I can have a conversation that has flow to it. Plus I actually care about what the other person has to say (sometimes). Most importantly, my apathy is gone, I am excitable again. I have thoughts which make me smile and laugh, it's glorious!

There is another thing I'd like to mention, my personality has not changed in the slightest since taking them, it just feels like i'm functioning better than I was before.

Now this post is not intended as a glorification of the drug. Far from it. For some people these drugs don't help, either they can't handle them, adverse effects take their toll, or they don't sense any meaningful impact from them. However, very rarely do these drugs actually worsen peoples lives. The main reason for my post here is because everyone here seems to share very similar cognitive processes, and hopefully someone can relate to this and/or be helped by this.

",22,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1awy44/spd_loneliness_love_friends_the_future_and_the/,"I haven't put any thought into [Schizoid Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) in years, since the days of my deepest loneliness in elementary school and early high school. Less than a day ago I was [reminded](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1auljq/do_you_folks_end_up_reflecting_too_much_and_if_so/c912191?context=3) of this possibility, and have spent much of my morning pondering it. 

It didn't take long to decide that I am pretty Schizoid, intermediate-high if online tests are a believable collaboration. It fits only too well, despite longing for a companion to love, and my attachment to my few friends, I disdain social interactions/relationships. I keep to myself in every sense of the term, I am secretive, enigmatic, cold and oversensitive all at once, apathetic, I find pleasure and enjoyment in few things, I live my life inside of my mind, and I find myself with little sexual desire. *I am an observer more often than I am a participant.* It fits just as well, if not better, than the INTP type description. It certainly explains many recent happenings in my life. 

* Loneliness is a constant struggle, but at the same time it comes and goes.   
* Depersonalization/derealization have become serious impediments into my life and the little enjoyment I find in it. It seems everytime I find something to be ""happy"" about some extra-dimensional realizations come about and destroys it.  
* I feel out of touch when I'm not around my close friends, which is very infrequently lately, but recently I can think of nothing but how we're growing apart and our differences when I am around them. The worst part is that I get ABSOLUTELY no feedback on myself leading me to form a self image that is.. empty and in constant flux. 
* Very recently I made an attempt at a romantic relationship, which was cut short due to (which I honestly believe to be partially to be my doing) her sorting out differences with her last (and constant) interest. What my SPD contemplation brought to my attention in this regard was my desire to please, to do everything in my power to aid and advance HER goals, needs and wants. Ideally, my physical and emotional self would be hers, I only need my mind to continue my quest for whatever it is higher understanding may be. Generally, it is an exploitative relationship, in this case it would have been entirely voluntary.  

At the moment, well, somewhat during but mostly after this post I am contemplating how to best fit my lifestlye and the way I go about accomplishing my goals to this additional description of myself. At first glance I believe it would involve more (believe it or not) social interaction than I had previously assumed. It's now pretty clear than I need some form of relational ""anchor,"" something I cannot have without socializing with someone close to me.

In conclusion, I have made many changes to my beliefs of love, friends, and my future. I can no longer believe that I can operate solely alone for such extended periods, this also confirms my recent observation that I do desire some form of personal love. This only makes worse the facts that my first attempt at love has, so far, been a dismal failiure, and that I am forced to spend more time alone as my friends leave.

I came back INTP.  I didn't think much of it as I am still skeptical of MBTI tests even now.  

Later on, I mentioned to my prof that I really have trouble with long term projects that require a lot of planning and organization.  I am much better with brainstorming and short bursts of creativity.   

My thoughts are also the same way - I dont have trains of thoughts, I have random thoughts that seemingly have little connection or order - I dont think in an organized fashion, I think more abstractly.

My prof told me to not try and change this.  If I try to be super organized I will loose one of my best and most valuable talents, which is to think and be creative.  This is an important skill if you work in a field that values creativity, innovation, out of the box thinking etc. 

I dont want to loose my creativity but I want to become more organized because it is causing me to have trouble getting things done.  For example when faced with a big, long term project, I get overwhelmed and I stall because i dont even know where to start.  I need to break it up into small tasks or do something to organize things but I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.  But if I somehow learn how, will I loose my creative mind?

As a kid, if I would watch a film or read a book, I tended to identify intensely with a character. I read Sherlock Holmes, for example, and became obsessed with developing comparable observational skills, or I watched Rounders and became obsessed with Hold 'Em, etc. It's not entirely dissociative, because I knew I was not that character, but I would try to reproduce qualities and skills they possessed, to a borderline self-destructive extent, especially when I watched heist films.

I have Oversized adenoids, which causes sleep-apnea, again making me sluggish and irritable. As well as not being able to breathe through my nose 80% of the time. No motivation at all. Just sad on the inside, followed by a period of euphoria and excitement and back down again. Constant sexual thoughts, followed by soul crushing guilt.

I fantasize about writing suicide notes. Etc etc etc.
Basically, I'm in rough shape... Yet still people always talk about how nice I am, how I'm chill and relaxed. Nobody has seen me get mad, but I've been known to freak the fuck out and punch walls. (only girlfriends have seen me do this)
I act in social situations. Apparently I'm a really good actor because I haven't once reflected the image of my true self to anyone. 

I'm not sure who I am, as I've never felt like the person who I portray.

I have to force myself to write down to-do lists, keep schedules/calendars/reminders of things I need to do every day. I'll forget to brush my teeth if I don't remind myself a few times. Deadlines, meetings, shifts at my college's dining hall, I'd forget them all without a lot of mental effort. I hate being that person who got too caught up with things to give any of her friends Christmas gifts this year. :/

I can almost never fall asleep right away, unless I'm dreadfully sick. My mind never turns off, and at night it seems to run even faster than usual, even if I'm exhausted. Making myself get up in the morning is sometimes even harder.

I've had an extremely tough time academically. I'm always embarrassed to be in the same world as people who so obviously work diligently on their assignments and achieve A's in all their advanced classes - the ones I passionately enjoy, but can't get myself through. I know I'm smart, but I feel like some sort of imposter in higher level chem and math classes with people who appear to be geniuses. Here I am, pretending to be ""normal,"" but I actually haven't read the chapter, or done the work. They'll be doctors someday - I'll be....? No idea really. I don't even know what I want to be doing. 

I just always feel like existing and thriving in my environment is taking up all the effort I've got.

We spend a lot of time in our heads and imagination. The physical world gets neglected and time passes so differently that we can easily make it to the end of the day without realizing we missed gym time. I've even seen discussions here where a lot of us can forget to eat at regular times (I'm guilty of this). 

However, I'm enthusiastic to see what discoveries other INTPs have made by applying objective analysis to their own gym habits. I'll kick it off with what I've observed. Let me know if it lines up with what you guys have found or if it completely contradicts.

In no particular order:

* I did Muay Thai at a legitimate training gym for a while and this worked really well as I didn't have to think for an hour and just followed directions. The changeup from day-to-day satisfied my need for variety and the peer pressure helped me exert way more effort and not try to cut corners with some new efficiency technique I thought up. Realized that executing physical actions wasn't a talent and was really interesting to see how practice became habit as I started out as awkward and rigid as possible due to overthinking how to do physical movements.

* While organized training worked well once I got there, the biggest challenge was making sure I got there. It was easy to plan on it all day and then get involved in some distraction 20 minutes before I needed to leave for class. I had some success circumventing this by forcing myself to go early to stretch (which tended to turn into getting there just on time).

* As for general gym, I've realized a successful workout needs to start in my head a good 20+ minutes before I get there. Good playlists made a huge difference here. I usually like indie stuff, which is underwhelming for a workout. I got invited to a mashup party that had great music that totally changed my workouts. I don't usually like pop, but the mashups were intellectually intriguing enough to get me into the music. They were designed around keeping a crowd amped and that carries over great to cardio rhythm. I find that I'm way better if I start this tempo of music on my way to the gym. If anyone's interested, my favorite mashups are free on the BootieSF website. They range from poppy (Katy Perry vs. The Dougie) to more badass (Iron Maiden vs. Bollywood). UPDATE: Here's the link to the mashups I really like: http://bootiemashup.com/bestof/. They definitely fall into the crowd-pleaser end of the spectrum.

* Short term use of pre-workout mix worked great for getting in the habit of the gym. Kinda like a super energy drink, these aren't recommended for more than a week or two at a time. However, these helped me get amped and feel really great during my workout while my body was getting hooked on natural endorphines from working out. After a couple weeks, I think my body just associated working out with feeling great and I didn't have to deal with the physical resistance to going. Totally worth the investment if getting back on the horse or developing a new habit.

* Always keeping my clothes ready and packed is huge. Before I exercised regularly, I would rely on a short supply of good shorts and socks. This lead to a stupid amount of friction in going to the gym since I could reason myself out of it if I needed to do laundry. My rule is to always pack my bag before I go to bed each night. That way, I can't leave the house without my clothes if I'm running late and I don't have to worry about the trip home to retrieve them being the place where I give up and get stuck. Also, keeping backup deodorant and backup hair product in my bag as standard cuts down on stupid excuse friction if I have a social event after the time I plan to hit the gym.

Edited for formatting.

Are you making your refuge in logic, becoming extremely analytical when you feel threatened on an emotional level?

So, how do we deal with it?

In my part, I think our third function, Si3 (introverted sensing) must be used in conjunction with the Fe4 (extraverted feeling) in order to get that feeling of catharsis, when a deep yearning is being soothed.

Practically - being in love and expressing my love (feeling) with touch (sensing) is the best.

Next, doing yoga, as yoga has a sensing part but also a feeling part, when I get it right.

Next is listening to music, also combining sensing with feeling.

One in particular has been working very well for me recently, so I thought I'd share it.

Right before going to bed, write a to-do list for the next day that you leave on your bedside table. The trick here is to only write the 3 most important things that must be completed the following day, that way you have a short clear list to focus on without getting overwhelmed or distracted due to too many individual goals. A variation of this is to write the top 10 most important things for the next day, and then cross out the last 7.

Then, the next morning, after looking again at the 3 things you are to get done that day, flip the page over and write a To-Don't list of all the stuff you're not allowed to do until you get your 3 things done. With this list, be as detailed and exhaustive as possible, covering all of the things you would otherwise be procrastinating with.

I got good grades, and was a smart kid, but I just didn't seem to care. ( now that I'm getting into this it might be a few questions). I don't know why this is, maybe I feel like I'm better or smarter than what I was spending my time doing? Ihated school, even though I found it easy. Skipped more than half my senior year. I couldn't stand it. Now I'm working at a job and I feel the same way! I feel as if its a waste of time and I could be doing so many more things. When I'm home however I like to engage in things that make me think, very strategic video games, clever movie plots, scenarios. Often times I just think about everything. Society, life, what makes people do what they do. I hate associating with current adolescence. I can't stand our current media, filled with want and advertisement. Terrible processed music that tell kids to act like assholes and get drunk and high at age 12. Disrespectfulness of people...especially those kids In Greece recently harassing the school bus monitor..Fucking.sick. these thoughts drive through my head all the time. Driving me crazy the only time I can relax is ..when I'm immersed in some movie or game or something. So my questions are...does anyone else find their job or school like its a complete waste of time? Or boring? Does anyone else feel the same way about society as I do?  Also, I know I'm a negative person.... I think of all the bads in everything and often bring conversations between me and people, family.mostly, to a negative turn. I don't like it but its just my mood all the time, I'm not happy. Do any of you feel this way? A negativity ? I feel like its because I lookso far into things and overthink everything.

INTP's tend to become the stationary reference point in context to those around them. We perceive people coming in ""waves"" into our world, and they come and go like the tides of the ocean. 

From my own perspective, time moves much slower in the context of social life. One week away from a friend would be no problem for me, as I find that time has little semblance to my personal connection to that person. However, that person might perceive a week away as something that weakens a relationship. Therefore we see our social clocks as something abnormal in the context of others, and find that socially our clock is running much slower than that of the extroverted world. 

Our perception of time and human interaction seems to be entirely different, and this has a profound effect on our interaction and relationships with others.

**The Way of What is to Come**

If I speak in the spirit of this time, I must say: no one and nothing can justify what I proclaim to you. Justification is superfluous to me, since I have no choice, but I must. (I skip around)

The supreme meaning is the beginning and the end. It is the bridge of going across and fulfillment

*The image of God throws a shadow that is as great as itself*

It is no teaching and no instruction that I give you. On what basis should I presume to teach you? I give you news of the way of this man, but not of your own way. My path is not your path, therefore I cannot teach you. The way is within us, but not in Gods, nor in teachings, nor in laws. Within us is the way, the truth, and the life.

There is only one way and that is your way

*The one eye of the Godhead is blind, the one ear of the godhead is deaf, the order of its being is crossed by chaos. So be patient with the crippledness of the world and do not overvalue its consummate beauty*

This is just a small taste of the work written by a man, who during the height of this insanity documented by ""The Red Book"", wrote another book entited ""Psychological Types"". Here is some bonus content from random sections later on:

The events that happen are always the same. But the creative depths of man are not always the same. Events signify nothing, they signify only in us. We create the meaning of events. The meaning is and always was artificial. We make it. Because of this we seek in ourselves the meaning of events, so that the way of what is to come becomes apparent and our life can flow again

If the God grows old, he becomes shadow, nonsense, and he goes down. The greatest truth becomes the greatest lie, the brightest day becomes the darkest night. As day requires night and night requires day, so meaning requires absurdity and absurdity requires meaning. Day does not exist through itself, night does not exist through itself. The reality that exists through itself is day and night. So reality is meaning and absurdity.*So meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to absurdity, and absurdity only a moment and a transition from meaning to meaning*

My deep interior is a volcano, that pushes out the fiery molten mass of the unformed and the undifferentiated... He who enters the crater also becomes chaotic matter, he melts... Because I have fallen into the source of chaos, into the primordial beginning, I myself become smelted anew in the connection with the primordial beginning, which at the same time is what has been and what is becoming. At first I come to the primordial beginning in myself. But because I am a part of the matter and formation of the world, I also come into the primordial beginning of the world in the first place.

I can't sleep.  This is chronic.  Last night I couldn't sleep and was dead tired all day long at a job, I might add, that theoretically involves a high level of customer service, a job that is completely wrong for me other than I have experience in the field.  And that is why I hate resumes.  People want to pigeonhole you to do something you've done before, but I've never really done anything completely appropriate, just a lot of random jobs.

I have no one to talk to.  This is profoundly disturbing and terrible.  I have a lot of ideas, to put it very mildly, and no one to whom I might express them and expect them to be understood.  It also means I have no critical feedback, nor any idea how to proceed realizing even a single one of my ideas. I can sit here and make/devise/ plan things all day, but if I can't do anything with it, it is pointless and meaningless.

I have untreated depression, and no social support network.  And all of my very minimal socially available ""energy"" is sapped by my job and just surviving.  I have one roommate/friend, who is an ISTJ.  He'll blather on endless pointless details about one of his hobbies (such as the history of the Marvel Universe) and then not let me finish two succinct sentences about something of import to me.  On occasions where I am allowed to speak in his presence, he sits in stony silence and does not respond.  He claims to be listening, but what he means by that is that he is able to recite back to me what I just said.  In other ways, he is a good friend, and in other ways a terrible drain on my time and energy, but in this way, the only way that really counts for me, he is essentially not there.

I've tried to talk to the internet to meet people, exchange ideas and so forth, but any exchange of a useful amount of depth would require an extended relationship, which doesn't really come from the mass of anonymous discussion.  The few times an actual conversation has ensued, it usually turns into someone trying to cheer me up, which is of course a futile tactic, or else the conversation abruptly ends.

It seems like I had more to say when I sat down here, but I've probably rambled long enough.  Thanks if you read this far.

I really don't know what to do.

**Edit:**  On top of that, I had my car broken into a few days ago, which was traumatic enough, but I didn't think they stole anything.  I just realize they stole my satchel, which had some replaceable items in it, but most importantly it had one of my design sketch books, and one of my idea notebooks.  I can't even describe how I feel about that now, and I can't emote/express it or otherwise do anything about it.

Is there a Relationship between it and INTP?,20,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/vxc05/looking_at_dr_david_weeks_research_in_to/,"A profile emerged with fifteen characteristics that applied to most eccentrics, ranging from the obvious to the trivial. We found that an eccentric may be described in the following ways, more or less in descending order of frequency. (Quoting from research by Dr. David Weeks)

**I was wondering how they apply to the INTP type in general, so how do these apply to you and INTP's you know?** 

The first five are in most people regarded as eccentric

* Nonconforming attitude
* Creative
* Strongly motivated by curiosity
* Idealistic: wants to make the world a better place and people happier
* Happy obsession with a hobby or hobbies

And Less importantly.

* Aware from early childhood that he is different
* Intelligent
* Opinionated and outspoken, convinced that he is right and that the rest of the world is out of step
* Noncompetitive, not in need of reassurance or reinforcement from society
* Unusual in his eating habits and living arrangements
* Not particularly interested in the opinions or company of other people, except in order to persuade them to his – the correct – point of view
* Possessed of a mischievous sense of humour
* Single
* Usually the eldest or an only child
* Bad speller


These seem traits to correlate well with the INTP type. These bare a striking to me, (All but 2 or 3 traits).

Einstein generally is regarded as both Eccentric and an INTP.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_behavior#cite_note-0


http://resistancetraining.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/are-you-an-eccentric/

&gt; The individual's eccentric behavior is perceived to be the outward expression of their unique intelligence or creative impulse. In this vein, the eccentric's habits are incomprehensible not because they are illogical or the result of madness, but because they stem from a mind so original that it cannot be conformed to societal norms.  - Wikipedia

Maybe I should explain the problem.  For my entire life I was made to believe that there was something wrong with me so tremendous amounts of effort had been put into trying to change my personality.  For example, people thought I day dreamed too much and payed attention not closely enough.  I didn't have much desire to obey authority -- I wasn't a bad kid, I just preferred to do my own thing than do what I was told.

People always seemed to think they knew best about what I should be doing and how I should be living, so I feel like I've been pushed and pulled in all different directions and not allowed the freedom to really discover myself.  Everyone seemed to want to transform me into a reflection of themselves and they often considered my interests and activities to be wastes of time.

Of course, all this came from people who were, by no means, successful in their own lives.  Out of everyone in my family, my sister is the only one of us who attended college (and that's also counting my aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) -- and she got flak for it and was told to ""drop out and get a real job"" several times.  My father mows lawns for a living and seems to think that any activity that does not immediately earn you money is not worth doing.  Most of my family members are also deeply religious and believe that any activity that takes time away from worshiping god is, likewise, not worth doing.

All of this had a pretty disastrous impact on my life and I think being denied the freedom to embrace my INTP personality probably had the biggest impact.  There was a lot of stress and anxiety caused by the conflict between what I wanted internally and the external pressures put upon me.  If I were free to simply life my life as I saw fit, I would have no doubt become far happier and much more successful.

If I had complete and total freedom, I'd pack up and move far away where nobody knew me nor wanted anything from me.  I'd just set out on a journey of self-discovery and not worry about whether or not my time is being wasted.  I just want to more freely be myself.

So, the starting point would be to discover more about how I can reconnect with who I naturally am.  When do you feel most in tune with your personality?  What can I do to gain greater acceptance of who I am -- both from others and myself?

So after reading many threads here I have noticed something. When some of you talk about your friends, SO's and other people in your lives you are somehow aware of the MBTI type of these people. 

I'm wondering is it just by observation or are these people that have done the test also. I know that it is rising in popularity in the US but here in Europe (and I'm speaking for about 4 countries when I say this) I have never met a single person who has even known about it. Not saying these people don't exist but it seems a lot less common.

Do any of you have any sort of advice on making a fairly accurate observation of a persons personality type?

*Aragorn: What do you fear, my lady?*
*Eowyn: A cage.*

I have two problems with commitment : 

* There is no 'undo' button in life. I feel like I have the ""Puer aeternus"" complex (aka ""the eternal child"", one who refuses to grow up).

&gt;The puer typically leads a provisional life, due to the fear of being caught in a situation from which it might not be possible to escape. His lot is seldom what he really wants and one day he will do something about it-but not just yet. Plans for the future slip away in fantasies of what will be, what could be, while no decisive action is taken to change. He covets independence and freedom, chafes at boundaries and limits, and tends to find any restriction intolerable.

(There might be more aspects to a puer but I only care about fear of commitment.)

* Abundance of options but lack of any good one.

Two main choices in life are career and marriage/relationship. 

Most jobs are pathetially routine and dull and require long hours. I could choose one, but which one. Because the positive aspect of any job is little (if any) and completely fades in comparison to what else is out there, I see myself looking for the ""least worst"" option, which just indicates I will be running around in jobs and will daydream about quitting.

And marriage is worse, how do I take not only the responsibility of another person but bring new lives into this world. And pay for their livelihoods and schooling (which I don't believe in) using money doing job(s) I loathed. And what do I tell them about life when I haven't seen any point to it myself !

The only way I see out is to ""change"" myself - to start doing all the boring work and take part in compensatory activities like movies, expensive clothes and cars that justify working hard. But to live a life defined by others and to start enjoying whatever others' idea of fun is, is a task I don't see going well. Either it won't work at all or it will leave me just more cynical and fatalistic.

How does one find goals, and make sure they have enough importance to the person so that you will do whatever it takes to get there?

::edit::

To expand on my dilemma, i have curiosity on a lot of things, but i have never gotten to the level that i deem adequate (perhaps due to my thought that if you don't make something breakthrough, it's not worth it).

eg. I would like to become extremely competent in maths. To a degree that i am able to prove various problems with the ability to explain everything that i want to mathematically. This, however, is not possible 1) i am not doing a mathematics degree so tutoring etc, will be non-existent 2) That would take years, and as much as i would like to do so, there would only ever be one person who would see how capable i am(ie. me).

I'm 21, white, male, 5'10"", happy, healthy and able bodied with both a pilots license and a helicopter license.  I absolutely love *good* music, I love motorcycles including dirt bikes, and my favorite activity is reading until I pass out.

But I'm disgusted with the direction of our society.  Just absolutely tired of it in more ways than one.  I don't claim to have higher intelligence than others, I don't think I'm better than people because of how lucky I am to be born healthy and in a free country, I just do not want to participate. At all. I feel like I've experienced all it has to offer me, and done it all enough that it has all become a DVD intro left on repeat when you fall asleep on the couch.  I've felt this way initially when I was 16, but only felt strongly about it when I turned 18. - I've been lucky enough to travel a ton since I was a child, it's definitely helped shape my world view to where it is now. One time I was riding a horse in a very poor part of Brazil when I was 8, and like it was yesterday, I can remember the looks and the reactions I received from the poor villagers and children who could not stop staring and touching my Nikes, like I was Jesus incarnate. You want to talk about a first time for checking your privilege, mother of fuck that was the very definition of it right there. Thanks for that experience, dad. My Fe may be inferior to my intuition, but I've never trusted this feeling of sacrificing my youth and myself to live freely to do the things I want more than ever. More on that below.

I currently have nothing holding me down. I flunked out of college on my own dime, and after three months am okay with it.  I was two years into an engineering degree, and looking back on it, it almost seems like a blessing in disguise.  It just wasn't for me and I probably would have quit before I graduated. Yes I was in it for the money, much like 80% of the rest of the students. Before (and now) I have a job cleaning nuclear turbines that is dirty and hard work, very physical manual labor, 12 hour shifts for sometimes three weeks straight, then usually a month off.  I usually net about upwards of $2,000 for a two week job if I keep my per diem - the great part is I get to travel to all these exciting locations like the Dominican Republic, Anchorage Alaska, Saudi Arabia, Madrid, Los Alamos, Dubai and even Navy shipyards.  Some of the stuff I've seen has been incredible, depressing, eye opening, and thought provoking.  A million adjectives still wouldn't do it justice.

I'm extremely introverted, but I like to use the word independent. I've had best friends tell me I am way too greedy with my free time, and I wouldn't argue against that at all. I am, and I don't feel bad for admitting it. I enjoy camping alone, I did LSD for my first time alone, I do all my shop work alone; I can be a team player, but only because I don't have time to cause a disturbance by being too good to be one.  I feel I can be whatever someone wants me to be in their company, but alone, I am truly my self.

The greatest pleasure for me in my life has been riding my motorcycle and doing manual labor work.  My dad has instilled the importance of working with your hands and doing hard work into me from a very young age from bailing hay to picking up every rock on the four mile dirt road.  I don't mind it, I find ways to make it enjoyable, and it always feels good when I do well.  There is something about producing actual work with your hands and seeing the final product.  Extremely gratifying. 

Over time though, I've realized I don't want anything to do with society because the idea of being a wage slave, having a wife and kids, attending social gatherings, being up to date on the latest trends, NONE of it appeals to me. I can't watch TV for more than 5 minutes, it's disgusting. It pisses me off how saturated, commercialized, and bloated everything has become.  I'm not eternally bitter, definitely not depressed, it is all just such a facade to me, and it irritates me. I can't stand it.  

I've realized I only grow as an individual the more I push myself to experience things outside my comfort zone, and I want to continue doing that. I'm only 21 now, but I feel I have much more growing to do.

Right now in Alberta CA the oil and gas industry is booming.  Paying for a place to live is expensive, but almost anyone with a high school degree and a good work ethic can find an oil rig job and start at $30-$40 an hour..  Yes the 12 hour shifts are long, the work is dirty and very dangerous, but the pay is ridiculously lucrative, and it seems to fit my skill set. There are guys who start out as total greenhorns making $40K per job.  It's insane.

I can't come up for a reason to NOT go up and work for as long as I can last, possibly a year or two living frugally while working and building capital.  I won't lie /r/INTP, I want to be filthy rich. Not for material possessions, rather so I can travel at my own leisure and experience the most possible 'experiences' I can.  

If I could save up 450,000 K (which would not take too long) I could start living the way I want to live.  Independent.  Alone.  Off the grid. Low maintenance, low stress living with absolute freedom.  Just thinking about the prospect of having money to build a small self sustaining farm near a body of water in complete silence gets my stomach tingling in excitement.  A chance at true freedom.

At one point I will run out of money, but I can always return to the manual labor jobs I love. My goal is to eventually have enough money by the time I am 30 along with an MBA to start a business on the side to keep my lifestyle going. What business, I have no clue. My best friend is finance guru already on his way to the top and has already pledged to have my back in anything financial related. 

There seem to be so many puzzle pieces and sometimes I think I have the whole ""box"" called life figured out, but I know in the back of my mind it would be foolish to think that.  There are always setbacks, financial troubles, and of course the curve ball called life. 

Here is my question to you all at /r/intp;

* How unrealistic would you say this plan is ?
* What do you personally think of it ?
* What is your personal 'plan' if you don't mind sharing?
* How are you doing? :)

Please be honest, I have thick skin and can take criticism as long as it's not derogatory. 

If you read it all, thanks.

**TL;DR** I don't want to participate in society, want to work on oil rig making bank for awhile so I don't have to live a regular life, allowing me to do the things I want when I want.  Want to travel a lot and eventually start a business with a childhood friend who I would take a bullet for. 

I just want to know what y'all think.  Because that is what we do all day when were day dreaming correct? thinking? It's great, isn't it? :)

I figured I'd ask here, since your experiences might help me better understand how it might be for me.

Perhaps I should provide a little background first.  I'm a currently unemployed 28 year old male living with my mother and older brother in an undeveloped back-woods area.  The only jobs I've had was as a janitor and the highest income I've ever had was around $7000.  There really aren't many options or opportunities here.

For most of my life I've had an interest in computer programming and I have taught myself a few different languages.  Most of my projects were video game related, but I've never really completed anything.  Also taught myself 3D graphics and animation.  The last few years I've been so down-trodden and depressed about my situation that I haven't been able to do much lately.

These are some of the reasons I am hesitant to attend college:

* A demanding schedule might leave me too tired to think.
* Too little time to freely pursue interests.
* No desire to get into debt -- that would only make my situation worse.
* Uncertain if I'd be able to cover basic living expenses.
* Not learning anything I'd be incapable of learning on my own.
* Uncertain if it would have any real effect on my ability to start a career.
* Graduating worse off than if I hadn't gone at all.
* If I'm going to put a lot of time and effort into something, maybe it would be better to make something I could sell.
* My family wouldn't approve of me going, since I was born into a religion that strongly discourages higher education.

Some of the reasons why I should go to college:

* My life is going nowhere with no foreseeable way of it getting better.
* I'm stuck in an area where the only successful business is the grocery store, and the only reason it's doing so well is because half the town is on food stamps.
* I'm surrounded by hill-billies and hicks.
* I rarely leave my room.
* It would be nice being around people who are motivated and enthusiastic about potentially interesting things.
* Maybe it could eventually help me get a jobs as a computer programmer, game developer, etc.
* It could provide a framework that could allow me to be more focused and productive.

Honestly, I would much rather have a job that pays enough to eek out a meager living -- even if it's just as a janitor again.  I can't imagine being able to earn enough to be able to survive on my own, though.

So, I'm asking here because every time I think about it, my mind goes round and round unable to come up with a good solution to my problems.  It's like I'm trapped in a no win situation and I don't know what to do.

When I conform I get this feeling of phoniness. I don't really like conformity in the first place. I often look back to conversations I've had in the past contemplating what other people thought of me. I wonder how people view me in general way too much.

For some reason I'm still paranoid people think I'm extremely eccentric even though I know that's the truth. I realize fully that I'm odd.

People seem to ask if I'm okay a lot. I just say, yes. A blatant lie. It reminds me when you say 'yes you saw that movie that you haven't actually seen before but you say yes anyways'  situation or a lot more commonly 'the hi, how are you' scenario or most social norms.

I think you are what you perceive. You are what you think. Even sexuality, you are what you think. Unfortunately I do not like my conscience. It's a mess. There's too much emphasis on the past and the future, hardly any focus on the present.

The author's main point here is that having the multitude of choices we have in modern Western society is making us depressed. Buyer's remorse, self-doubt, indecision - these are feelings we have when presented with choices. Modern technology has enabled all these choices and now we are simultaneously enjoying and suffering from this freedom.

Many would say that the quarter-life crisis and the mid-life crisis are first-world problems. We are simply presented with too many choices. Modern transportation and communication technologies have enabled us to live anywhere we want in the world. Just a few hundred years ago, most of people lived near their place of birth and spent the majority of their lives there. As modern day humans in first world countries, we have the choice of where to live, how to make a living, what hobbies to pursue, who to marry, etc. Eventually, in the darkest times in our lives, we will question our choices, fully knowing that the present and the future could have been quite different had we chosen differently, leading to an existential crisis.

As INTPs, we probably have it worse since we ""live in a world of possibilities."" We are open to new things yet we are indecisive, procrastinating perfectionists. Making decisions ain't easy.

Although I do not agree with everything that is stated in his work, Kaczynski's ""Industrial Society and Its Future"" has some valid points about modern technology making us not as happy as our pre-industrial ancestors. I am too lazy to cite, but I have read studies saying that people who experience nature are happier than city-dwellers disconnected from nature. 

I am not a luddite. I use technologies from smart phones to social networks to supercomputers and electron microscopes. Technology makes me happy in the way that a drug would.

TL;DR (I highly doubt that anyone will read through my poorly written article...): Modern society presents us with too many choices and as a result, we are unhappy.

TL;DR of the TL;DR: Free will == unhappiness

Does anyone here feel something similar? How do you deal with choices and indecision as an INTP?

XSXJ: Builders should extend interfaces, see this other bit of code that we're basing this builder on.

Me: Yeah, but in that case there was reason for us to use different builders in different situations. In this case it's just a bunch of getters and setters so we won't be swapping out builders. It doesn't really matter but it's just more places where a typo can screw things up.

Me: The builder itself creates the same contract...

I am his first girlfriend but he has had many online relationships with girls(not sure how to word it but they shared a deep connection but never had anything official). We are both recent grads living together in his mom's apartment, both of us are unemployed as of now...

Anyway, from my perspective I can see that there are A LOT of things going on in his life that are piling up on him and overwhelming him and it's totally understandable for him to be upset under these circumstances. I don't know how appropriate it is to go into depth here so I'll list some general issues he's up against here:  

* his father passed away a few years ago(before we started going out) and his mother(an ENFJ) is part of cult she's kind of delusional and very irresponsible which really bothers my bf

* he is facing a lot of health problems

* he is worn out after his graduation was  forcibly dragged out  another year by his professor, not to mention I don't think he is entirely happy with his major in the first place (he has a Masters in Mechanical Engineering)

* he is having trouble getting a job and even finding motivation to apply to them. I can't blame him for this. He has had past experience in the ""working world"" already and he thinks it's generally terrible and I agree.

* he feels guilty about being a shut in/doing nothing all day and not being being ""responsible"" by job hunting etc

* he is being annoyed by a friend (ESTJ) he doesn't care much about. the friend constantly calls him b/c he's going through a break up and always asks to play games him my bf

Anyway, with all this burdening him I try to be as helpful as possible. I try to take care of the everyday needs as much as possible like grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning etc. I never judge/nag/criticize him, I try to keep him company as much as I can. Play games together, watch shows together etc, accompany him on walks/adventures whenever he gets the urge even if it's 3 am etc. 

I think he's generally happy with me ? but I know deep down he's unhappy in some places because he thinks our relationship is sub-optimal, not necessarily bad but sub-optimal nonetheless and for an intp that may as well be  bad... You could call MBTI one of his hobbies/interests so he is always trying to analyze why things work or don't work from a MBTI perspective. Anyway late last night we had a conversation where he told me how he is unhappy at my inability to help him, at least not in a meaningful way ? and he said he knows for certain there is a direct correlation between his depression and going out with me... (T____T)  Anyhow I kind of brought up the other girls he had connections with in the past because he always hints at it and because I wanted to understand how they were able to help him so I could do the same. They were all ESFP girls and after me bringing them up he  ended up longing for them (basically saying he misses his Esfp relationships) and feeling guilty about it cause he feels like he is betraying me by thinking and longing after it. I told him it's natural to yearn for the good past experiences he used to have etc. and he shouldn't feel bad about it and that it's okay and I love him etc. Anyhow, this sort of conversation has happened several times before and he has told me he tried to be more entp ish for me but it's not natural for him and that he has also thought of me becoming more esfp to help him but things just don't really work that way ? He also concluded that he thinks I'm not an isfp, (he actually can't type me at all) because he has had an isfp girl help him out a lot before too so in theory if I'm an isfp I could help him too.

Honestly I think a lot of my issues of not being able to help him is because I basically had zero friends, zero human connections of this sort growing up. Zero social/emotional skills. No one ever helped me with my problems and I never had the opportunity to help someone else. It's also possible that my general emo/sad/lonely kitten-ness in the past has rubbed off on him. I'm much happier now though but I'm certainly no bouncy bubble of positivity and energy, at least not yet ? I am actively working on developing my social skills and trying to grow as a person as I know I have a lot to learn. Anyhow can you guys give me any tips/honest feedback/perspective on this situation ? 

**Edit :**Okay thanks for all the responses everyone. It's given me a better perspective on things. I think we can all see he is not in a healthy mental state right now. Given everyone's input I think my bf withdrew initially after his father died and kind of gave up after that as everything around him seemingly went into disarray and he got overwhelmed with problems. I probably didn't emphasize it enough but my bf is typically always in discomfort due to teeth and stomach problems so I'm going to help him meet with doctors etc. I'm also trying to discourage his general pessimism and help him understand himself better because I don't really think he understands how to make his own intp brain happy. I'm also gonna try to get him to not put so much value into this mbti stuff as it really just ends up making things worse in general for him. If we end up breaking up ( which I don't think will happen unless he really refuses to face his problems ) that's fine by me. Anyway, thank you all again! I think intp's are some of the most interesting people around :3

I can't wait to do it again and find it one of the best ways to spend a holiday/vacation as an INTP. One often rides alone and when paired with others there is still plenty of time to enjoy your thoughts. It's almost as if the rider pedals stationary, playing in their own mind's creativity/universe while the world's landscapes rolls past you at a steady pace. 

The exercise and physical effort one is forced to exert is like strong nootropic drugs for the mind. Your thoughts shine as you sweat and feel the sun and weather around you.

Your limited baggage allows for extremely low [Opportunity-Costs](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1d1wb3/the_paradox_of_choice_and_modern_technology/) day to day. Your mind isn't tethered about repetitive indecisiveness caused by the Perceiving part of our character. Also, the choices one makes have much greater satisfaction to them. So life is both easy and more satisfying.  Living in a world where capital usually drives us, a life this easy begins to feel almost like cheating. 

You never have to rush anywhere or be someplace at a certain time. All one is required is to do is find food and pedal across land day to day. 

Although pedaling a loaded bicycle is tough and moves relatively slow, the rider may find their meta-physical world beginning to expand as the cost of moving is raised(compared to just pressing the gas pedal in a car) and their speed is governed by physical strength. The rider notices every breeze hill, bump, tree, neighborhood  etc. Less is more. I still have vivid memories of the topography and surroundings of the path I took. Interpersonal souvenirs of a great vacation. Perhaps walking or running may make this even more pronounced by I think effort to speed/weight is just perfect while bike touring.

Maybe touring isn't for everyone, but I think many INTP'so ut there have wondered so I am here to validate your thoughts and let you know that your instincts were correct, it is worth trying at least once in your life time.

&gt;I cannot definitively answer that. But I can say that you, and someone exactly the same as you, are, for all intents and purposes, the same person. Sure, you'd be separated from that person mentally and physically, but there would be no reason to determine a difference between you, there aren't any. You would be specimen 1 and specimen 2 of the same individual, there would be no reason for you to share any form of ""connection.""

&gt;Consider this, you age from 10 to 25 years, 15 years of growth. Are you the same person? No, your neural configuration would be entirely different, you would make an entirely different decision at age 10 than you would age 25 when faced with the same stimuli. Now, consider free will. We certainly have the illusion of free will, we certainly pick our own choices, but do we have a CHOICE in making that choice? Reason says no. Certain things about you are determined by your DNA makeup, your genome, really everything about your starting state is. Your brain is then shaped by those genes and further molded constantly from the moment of first life to your death by all stimuli you encounter. Despite being a TERRIBLY complex system your brain does work in a set way, two brains with an identical make-up will always react the same answer when faced with a stimuli. Everything you think, decide, feel or believe is decided by your genome which is then supplemented by your neurological system which evolves through stimuli. 

&gt;Now, consciousness, none of this is proof, but it is a reasoning of sorts that convinces me. ""Self"" is a concept, a meaning, not a reality. You are only you as much as you say you are. In my mind consciousness is merely a side effect of having such an advanced and complex brain. It only makes sense, think about it for a moment. All of your senses culminate in your brain, it makes sense of the information your sensory organs pick up. Naturally, the set of sensory organs that ""belong"" to you would be seen as part of your whole, and anything that doesn't make you function does not belong to you. Is the infrared camera scientists wired to a mouse part of it? It senses through it no differently than you do with your eyes (other than picking up different wavelengths of light), despite being created at a different time and place it is as much a part of that mouse as any other organ, the only ""meaningful"" difference would be that the camera was not created from the mouse's own genetic code.",,False,,t5_2qhvl,False,,,True,t3_19o4cz,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/19o4cz/an_involved_comment_i_wrote_on_facebook_i_thought/,

The illusion of self is likely known to a lot of you. And good drug experience will make it blatantly obvious that when your attention is tuned to the present moment (instead of just in a sea of thought) it doesn't feel like ""I"". And then contemplative meditation just makes it vividly clear without the rush of a drug in your system. 

[Sam Harris on the concept of death, present moment and meditation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTxTCz4Ums)

The illusion of free will is something that isn't as fun to learn about (I really struggled with it for a while) but ultimately I think I am a better more enriched person for it. It's also harder to describe and sum up. This matter is slightly more open to debate but even the strongest scientific claims for the existence of free will are radically different than how most people view their actions. 

[Sam Harris on free will](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g)

* Note * Apparently this video has had incredibly adverse effects on people as you literally re-evaluate everything. I am of the belief that the truth is always the best option but this might be the strongest case against that position. I'd certainly say that if you are oblivious to the illusion of self that this is going to be a very uncomfortable listen. 


Sorry for the length of this. The two videos (well more his books) have had a radical impact on how I view the world (especially coupled with meditation). Also sorry for the Sam Harris jerk off but he is so incredibly good at clearly getting a point across and I guess it's in my personality to really latch onto the ideas of those that I look up to (Orwell, Thomas Paine, Jefferson).

These past two years I've spent at an educational facility called a 'college' here in the UK, which would be the last two years of high school for those in the US. During these two years, I have been quiet, keeping to myself, in my own little world, etc.

People around me have been nice but, due to my coldness, I had not been able to establish proper social connections with them. Which leaves me as the 'odd one out' of the group. Trouble is, this course I'm taking is a particularly group-orientated course. So, every time there's been a group assignment, I've been the 'odd one out' there too.

By the time I wanted to be friends with everyone, it was too late and I was typecast. As I said, they still remain amicable but it's not like friendships or even acquaintanceships - soon as college is over for the day, I'm out the door on my own. This snafu has been all my doing and it should be up to me to get myself out of it and connect with the people at long last, but even so, this is my last year.

I just don't want them to remember me on a sour note, however.

Now I'll be straight with you, I didn't take the job seriously.  I did not like being an inside sales member ( cold caller ), and I got the job from a family friend.  It made me miserable to be in that office.  Drove 70 miles to work there and back every day.  700 miles a week.  400$ a month in gas.

I feel bad for the people I let down because I did not give the job my all, I know I can truthfully say that.  I feel bad that when I tell my girlfriend that she'll be disappointed with me, I feel bad for my family that I let them down ( this was my first real job out of college ).

I think this may be an opportunity to try to attempt some of those inner dream jobs that I really want.

Some reference points:

Fave all-time games:  FFVI, Earthbound, Starcraft, Diablo series, Monday Night Combat, Icewind Dale, Ogre Battle

Currently playing: Diablo 3 (and trying to finish ME3 before I get too detached and forget everything)

360: BF3, Deadly Premonition, Dark Souls, Mass Effect series, Borderlands, Fallout 3, Bioshock, Bayonetta, Bastion, Dragon Age

Mobile:  Neuroshima Hex, Words with Friends, Game Dev Story, Pew Pew 2, Plants vs Zombies, Tilt to Live, Advance Wars, Tactics Ogre

As you can see, I'm into all kinds of different games, but I tend to favor those with some sort of deeper tactical nuance.  I also have a very strong nose for gameplay/competition balance, and absolutely detest games that are severely imbalanced for some reason.  Challenge is a must, but I'm not a hardcore type that tries to beat games with an under-levelled and gimped character.

It's this weird combination of panicking and feeling like nothing is wrong. That's how my depression is... depression for my is this weird thing... because on one hand I don't feel depressed, but I know that I am ( I don't know how to explain it). I just can't seem to get grounded and get my head out of the clouds and face my problems and start doing stuff. I'm falling behind miserably at college because I'm not enjoying the work at the moment, and I could fail this semester if I don't start getting my shit together. Like i've said before, I feel disconnected from reality and I can't seem to put my life into perspective. I have a shit load of work to do and if I don't do it there are some terrible consequences, but I don't feel anything... All I can think of is that I'm a human on a planet spinning around in space... and my greatest worry is writing an essay... I start looking at the topic for my essay and then I find myself staring at the stars for hours thinking about life and the absurdity of it all. Then I feel guilty because I think of my hardworking parents, working to pay for my college tuition and here I am looking at the fucking stars. 


**TL;DR**: This has turned into a long rant... I'm sorry. 
I guess I'm wondering if you consider yourself a ""dreamer"" ? Even when I'm not stressed out or bored I've been known to drift off. Would you consider yourself an escapist? How are you when you're extremely stressed out? I go from two extremes: completely isolate myself or make sure that I'm constantly going out and seeing friends. Do you ever feel increasingly disconnected from reality for long periods of time? Do you tend to just switch off from reality?


Are these basic human characteristics? Is it normal for people to just disconnect from reality when you feel like your whole life is kind of just falling apart? Feeling kind of lost right now and confused... and you guys are  like my favourite people on the internet so, any adivce, thoughts whatever etc you have would very much be appreciated.

I wanted to say it's something very beautiful that you should look forward to, even though the process is rough emotionally, at least for me it has been.

I have had the support of some wonderful INTPs and ENTPs on this journey. I work with an INTP and having to let go to accommodate his style has been part of that journey. I only did it because I respected him so much that I knew any loss of self this might entail would be worth the final result. And it was. I'm almost INTP myself now and I leave things to the last minute! It's fun. No more to-do lists, no more forward planning. This shift has also helped my Fi. I cry very easily, and I have started admitting to watching sappy movies and talking about my feelings. The ENTPs have watched over me and fed me with new ideas whenever I start hitting the dead depression zone, they are optimism and life-love machines that I really couldn't live without. 
So this is isn't a DAE, it's just a thank you note. At some point I noticed I was getting a lot more positive vibes on this sub than on the INTJ one, and now I understand why!

I usually make it up to the point where I am in an internship position and realize that I hate the trade and drop out. I don't really do this on purpose at all, but all my motivation and energy fades away as soon as I realize how mundane that type of work really is. At that point I can't even force myself back into finishing.

But I grew up in a very conventional, white/middle class, somewhat conservative Canadian town.  I was always into drawing and music as a kid but a lot of pressure was put on me to do well in sports since that was highly valued in my family and school settings.  I actually excelled at football and was mvp for a few years. But being socially awkward and cerebral, I never really fit in with any one social group.

Now I find myself at 30, still somewhat alienated by the conventional values of bourgeois middle-class life I was sold growing up. I realize I should be working on things like having a career, marriage, mortgage, kids. But instead of being interested in those things I feel this constant impetus to create some kind of important work of art.  I perpetually second-guess myself about this and often wonder whether I'm just having delusions of grandeur and I should just get with the program and join the 9-5 work-a-day world.

I think I would like to write a novel one day but so far it's just a thought because I find it so hard to settle on one idea and flesh it out. It's constantly on my mind to write something good but I just don't even know where to begin.  There's so many details to consider that I end up getting stuck thinking and contemplating instead of actually *doing*. 

But the one thing I'm sure of is that it is insane how we're lead to believe that success in life is all about accumulating material goods to impress others; becoming automata subservient to the corporate hive interests.  

Isn't the most fundamentally beautiful thing a human can do with their time is create and share something utterly novel, and unique to their individuality?  

Do any INTPs out there feel this way about creativity and art?  How do you actually follow through and put in the hours of work instead of just thinking  and analysing?

1369013022.0,16,self.INTP,1eo02z,INTP Shadow Functions: merging with the shadow?,20,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1eo02z/intp_shadow_functions_merging_with_the_shadow/,"I think I may have discovered some novel relationships between the normal and shadow functions. I'm only intermediately versed in typology, so it wouldn't surprise me if somebody else has already figured this out, but I have yet to read anything about this. 

**Here's what my hypothesis does:**

1) It accounts for the polarization of i/e functions in myers-brigg typology while maintaining 'separation' between the i/e planes (only shadows can cross between the planes). 

2) It demonstrates that there is a much larger diversity between the personality types than what was previously accounted for in the traditional theories. 

**Here it goes:**

Every function within the myers-brigg cognitive stack is coupled with a shadow which determines how that function is expressed. ~~For example, an introverted function (Ti) would be 'unconsciously' expressed by an extroverted shadow (Se), while an extroverted function (Ne) would focus attention on an introverted shadow (Fi).~~ An introverted function (Ti) would be 'unconsciously' energized by an extroverted shadow (Se), while an extroverted function (Ne) would be internally energized by an introverted shadow (Fi). All thoughts must pass a certain energy 'threshold' to go from unconscious to conscious.

So let's assume that all of the functions exist on a spectrum, with the introverted (i) functions in one plane, and the extroverted (e) on another plane. Furthermore, T is polarized with F, and S is polarized with N. Theoretically, all of your thoughts lie somewhere in this spectrum, and all functions, shadow or normal, are constantly expressed at all times (to a certain degree). This really isn't that far-fetched of a statement, because you can trace very basic properties of waking consciousness to every single function. 

When we are doing something introverted, like thinking (Ti), our focus is on the 'introverted plane', thus the 'extroverted plane' is unconscious (shadow). In our stack, Se and Te are shadow functions, so if an extroverted shadow is expressed in conjunction with Ti, it would have to be one of those. It took me a long time to figure it out in a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1emhw5/modification_of_intp_functional_stack/) that makes little sense how the shadows correspond to the functions. I based my logic on the esoteric meanings of these functions. I know that sounds silly, but how do you think Jung came up with these ideas??? Just assume for arguments sake that my calculations are correct, Ti's shadow is Se. I'm not exactly sure what this means, but Se either energizes Ti and/or Ti is expressed through Se.

So as I began to mix/match various shadow/normal functions together, a very peculiar pattern emerged. The shadow functions appear to be coupled such that there is some sort of reverse coupling between neighboring functions as you proceed down the stack - 1,2,3,4. So, the shadow function in 1 would not be expressed in 2, the shadow in 3 not in 4, 4 not in 1, etc. (it loops around). Apparently this pattern has something to do with the process of [Individuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation). You must confront your shadow in order to progress to the next function. The consequence of this behavior is that the function within the stack immediately proceeding the function you 'conquered' will not express the conquered shadow. So there are technically 2 shadows associated with each function, one shadow over-expressed, the other under-expressed.

Here is my tentative **INTP Functions Chart**

**Primary:** Introverted Thinking (Ti)

Expressed Shadow - (Se) Repressed shadow - (Ni)

**Secondary**  Extroverted Intution (Ne)

Expressed Shadow - (Fi) Repressed shadow (Se)

**Tertiary** Introverted Sensation (Si)

Expressed Shadow (Te) Repressed shadow (Fi)

**Inferior** Extroverted Feeling (Fe)

Expressed Shadow (Ni) Repressed shadow (Te)


Here are some consequences of this pattern for INTPs:

1) While Ti is functioning, Ni is repressed, thus 'feelings' are repressed as well (because Fe is coupled with Ni). Without Ni, Fe won't have enough 'potential energy' to express itself. So as a consequence of Ti shadow coupling, Fe is indirectly suppressed. Ni is our darkest shadow and is the last shadow 'conquered' in our stack.

2) Both Ne and Fe are strongly polarized towards their respective ends (N and F), while Ti and Si are polarized somewhere in the T/S spectrum. No other personality type will have this exact function spectrum/distribution. 

3) The Fi shadow of Ne may disrupt Ti's ability to be expressed by Ne. I'm not sure how this would manifest, because primary functions like Ti should be able to dominant the shadows, but this could mean that Ne is internalized somewhere in between Fi and Ti, AKA the MIDDLE OF THE SPECTRUM. This allows Ne to be expressed in an immensely diverse way, but this could also lead to contradictory or unproductive information, especially since Ne is polarized very far away from the Se side of the spectrum (more in your head, less out there). This is an INTP's Ne, which is not the same as an ENTP's Ne.

4) Using Beebe's archetype analysis, the Hero is coupled with the Trickster and avoids the Witch, the Good parent is coupled with the Demon and ovoids the Trickster, the Anima is coupled with the Witch etc etc. This actually fits in amazingly well with Jungian psychology so heavily dominated by myth. 'The hero must battle the trickster in order to move on the the next level' (individuation).

5) As we continue to mature and develop our functional stack, we should focus on our shadow functions (and their relationship to the normal functions we want to develop). So for Si, using Te while suppressing Fi would give us 'stronger' Si. I'm aware that most descriptions of INTPs talk about us having a very Fi-based Si. But what if those descriptions are based on a tendency of the majority?

**Why is this theory useful?**

1) It accounts for the polarization of i/e functions in myers-brigg typology while maintaining 'separation' between the i/e planes (only shadows can cross between the planes). 

2) It demonstrates that there is a much larger diversity between the personality types than what was previously accounted for in the traditional theories. For example, Ne for an INTP is not the same Ne as for an ENTP which is not the same as an INFP. Technically, they all have a distinct Ne^123, which means that 3 separate descriptions are required to adequately explain what 'Ne' really means. Furthermore, this allows for wiggle room within the types based on how well each person has 'conquered their shadow'.

1361159789.0,15,self.INTP,18qbiu,Practicing,15,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/18qbiu/practicing/,"According to a lot of INTP profiles, we hate practicing.

For example, [this profile](http://intp.info/profile/):
&gt;Competency is a key driving factor in the INTP. When studying something, his goal is to learn enough to basic errors and perform well enough to not be embarrassed by it. Refining skill beyond that would require too much practice, something that is not attractive to the INTP. Once one has been learned, he moves on to the next skill.""

Or [this](http://www.intp.org/intprofile.html):
&gt;While proficiency may not be a central goal, competence always is. The difference here may be subtle, but it is important. If an INTP decides to learn a skill, then it is very important for him that he reaches a sufficient level so that basic errors can be avoided. Errors made by others are to be expected and can be criticized. But errors made by oneself attack the very root of the person, which is ultimately about rationality, logic and truth. INTPs hate to think of themselves being in any way inadequate, at least in areas that are important to them. So, as soon as he puts himself behind some task, then he must achieve competency. But that is as far as it goes. Refined competency requires too much effort and has little attraction. It would require practice and that usually bores an INTP. Hence, it is common to see INTPs dabbling at many things, achieving competency, just enough to prove to themselves that they could become more proficient if they wished, but rarely actually bothering to refine their skills further.

As I pondered these statements when I first ran across them years ago, they resonated, and made me want to overcome what I perceived to be a weakness in my nature. I've kept thinking about this aspect of my personality. For example, I am a musician, and play sports, and both require a lot of practice. I've been doing both activities for a large number of years, so I am beyond competent, but not truly *great* at both. And I want to achieve that in some areas of my life beyond my day job, where I naturally ""practice"" it every day.

Further, research has shown that practice trumps talent in the world, based on how our brains work. If you have an interest in these topics, I highly suggest reading the fascinating books [The Talent Code: Unlocking The Secret of Skill](http://thetalentcode.com/), and the book [Mindset:The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-Psychology-Success-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361124606&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mindset), which emphasizes hard work and practice at the heart of success.

The thing is, I **hate** practicing. It's boring. And when I do it, I keep wondering if I'm practicing correctly, and so just reinforcing bad habits. I love doing it with a trainer, or a coach, and I have both. But that doesn't replace that hundreds of hours you should be spending just improving your skills on your own.

If you want to perform like a pro, you need to practice like a pro.

My question to the group is: are any of you good at practicing? How do you do it?

Specific questions that I'd like to answer about practicing:

1. How do you enforce self-discipline to practice regularly? This is the kind of self-discipline that I don't think we INTPs are inclined to be good at.

2. How do you make sure that you are practicing what you should, rather than just reinforcing bad habits?

3. How do you adjust your practice to gain new talents, and broaden your skills?

4. On the flipside of 3, what types of things do you need to do to continue to hone fundamentals even while working on new things?

5. How do you keep this engaging? Month after month of this becomes boring, and there must be some way to make this interesting enough to stick with it.

Anyone achieve a measure of success with practicing in spite of our natures? Are there any books people would recommend that explain how to do this?

so here's the story: (I am 20 btw) I met this guy on the busstop and I was all like ""ok, cool. making friends. getting out of my comfort zone a little. because it's healthy to be out of ones comfort zone now and again""

well, anyway, it turned out he fancied me which was quite flattering, since no ones' ever admitted something like that to me, but I never really intended for that to happen so I told him it's never gonna happen and he seemed cool with it. The thing is, before I realized that he liked me he texted me everyday for a month long, and after I gave him the rejection he stopped.(which gave me the impression that he obviously only spoke to me to get in my pants or some metaphor like that)

BUT he still wants to be my friend (or so he makes me think, for all I know he just doesn't want to seem like a douche) , because he occasionally texts me again, like once a month or something. Needless to say, it's annoying, and he's boring, and I don't want to be his friend, but I am a nice polite person so I am just nice to him and try to keep the conversations short even though he won't let me.

I don't know whether it's because I know he fancied me and the fact that he did put me a little off and made him a little annoying to me or because we have absolutely nothing in common and I don't really talk to people that I don't have things in common with, or more so if it's because conversations with him are either quite superficial or always end up with him being all ""you should come visit my church"", now if I knew if he was one of those religious people who can't stop talking about their church then I would've never befriended him in the first place (i have nothing against it, I just don't want to be stuck in a conversation like that) . Though i should've known when his first question to me was what church I go to that he'd be like that . 

I feel like such a bad person. o.O What makes things worse is that he lives in my neighbourhood, so it would be quite awkward to just cut him off. And he just makes it impossible to be a fader, he just takes nothing personally.

Let me know if this crosses a line or something.

As an INTP, I am very much defined by my intellectual curiosity; there is a constant hunger to learn more, process more, and create more. That said, I find it difficult to completely step out of the mental labyrinth when appropriate... like when it's time to get physical. Though I have a relatively low sex drive compared to the average person, I enjoy sex a lot and have a really fantastic and creative (and hot as hell) partner. Satisfaction, attraction, and intellectual connection aren't issues for us. My issue is that my mental wanderlust is not something I can easily let go of in favor of my physical sexy-lust taking control. I'm kinky and open-minded so I'd like to figure out how to let go more often and enjoy *all* of that, whenever I want, without the massive over-analyzing and theorizing that comes with my INTP-ness.

Normally I do a quick 16 bars loop, perfect it and listen to it on repeat for an hour. I can't get around to finishing a song actually, for me the whole build up, climax and all that structural stoff is much more of a chore rather than expressing my feelings. When I get around to finish a song this is rather obvious as my structures are very rigid and non playful. 

So fellow musicians, how do you actually get over not finishing a song ? I think it's a waste of talent really because music is pretty much my only way to convey emotions to other people and I'm willing to share it with other people, but the thought of having to make WHOLE songs just isn't my thing.

I've always been rather interested in the optimisation of food. Though, I've come to realise that perfection is incredibly subjective and each person will have their own idea of what perfection is.

So I'm trying to take a few incredibly basic foods and optimise them based on recent census data, bioscientific research, psychological studies on perception and sense linked memories, conservation data on food sources and whatnot.

My relationships generally tend to begin and end in the following steps: **(1)** Initial attraction, **(2)** Attraction grows to an intense sense of attachment in a matter of weeks, **(3)** In a matter of weeks, I begin to plan out a future with said person in my head, and become vocal about these plans which gets the other person's hopes up and causes them to start to fall head-over-heels with me, **(4)** After a period of 4-8 months, I lose all sexual attraction, sexual activity ceases almost completely, and I begin to resent this person's personality (due to different views/values, irrational emotion from their side, or their lack of intelligence), **(5)** I make the decision that I no longer wish to be with said person, but due to fear of disturbing the harmony, I avoid talking about my problems and tend to just ignore the problem and said person for quite a long time, **(6)** Partner gets restless, begins to catch on to my sudden lack of emotional and sexual interest, and usually ends up breaking the relationship off themselves because of the distance that I've suddenly created. 

I think that my relationships fail because I choose people with the ""wrong"" personalities. I tend to go for ""feelers"" rather than ""thinkers"", and a lot of my partners have been extraverted. I jump into relationships and become attached too quickly to realise that I absolutely despise this person's personality, and my ""love"" for them really interferes with my analytical skills.

What are your experiences with relationships, and do they begin and end in a similar set of steps to mine?

How do you feel about looks? Being aware of how deep can be people's interior lifes, and intimidated equally by the mere act of being in front of any stranger, one may be almost unable to see any individual externally unattractive. Only when one watches their behaviour and hear them express their real, interior self, they start to seem different to each other.

Further, average looks may even be the most desired, as it's easier to feel at ease and not let appareances be a barrier to communicate with the person behind.

Via /r/NZtrees subscribers, a letter to MPs campaign started and we're beginning to get some responses... The letter specifically asks the MP's:

**""Can you please outline your position on this? And also why you believe this government has ignored recommendations from the NZ Medical board, Ministry of Social Development, NZ Drug Foundation, top ranking Police Officers and the NZ Law Commission""** (the letter and [related evidence is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NZTrees/comments/rtvi7/proposal_blanket_our_mps_on_20th_april_420_with_a/)).

There's been a boiler plate reply (which started this whole thing off...) from the the ministry of health (as it comes under their portfolio oddly enough, i.e. criminalising users for 'health' reasons?!) - the evidence they supply as justification is resoundingly debunked in the letter linked above - and I'm waiting on a new reply currently. 

Then there was also [this from a coalition partner party](http://i.imgur.com/QnvhX.jpg) - who's leader is a cabinet minister. Not sure they could have ignored the specific questions any more successfully...

As an INTP and with the incontrovertible evidence supplied in the letter, how am I meant to approach the next stage - if there is one? Evidence is being ignored because ""the politics of the issue have some way to go"" - so while they're politicking, people get criminal records, travel restrictions or jail? 

To my mind, it has NOTHING to do with politics or politicians...

I had one such encounter the other day. Long story short, yesterday a girl that I've been attracted to for some time comes over to my house, one thing leads to another, and we end up in a *sexy situation.* This *sexy situation* rapidly turns into a comedy of errors. 

The make-out portion of the scene was excellent, but when things escalated I proceeded to repeatedly botch the whole condom process (breaking several of them) and otherwise have the off-day of off-days.

I have an odd sense of humor. It happens to the best of us, I suppose.

The unique thing is this: *regardless, I think we both had a fairly decent time.* I actually had fun, despite the fact that the sex part was mismanaged. She was clearly flustered to say the least at several junctures, though any *normal* person would have probably either gotten angry, overemotional, and/or left. 

Instead, we had some pretty pleasant naked conversations, which are objectively better than normal conversations. She was surprisingly candid; I usually have great difficulty wheedling out what people actually think. Apparently my odd sense of humor is shared. We concluded that the universe was trying to prove some rude point, given that we were trying to screw on Kierkegaard's birthday. All things considered, I had good fun in a scenario what would have certainly turned out atrociously with someone else. I think it helped immensely that we both think in a similar fashion.

Is the official 9/11 story true?  Absolutely not in my opinion.  Etc.

I have wondered for a long time why I am able to go from being completely pro fluoridation, having never considered it, to doing 20 minutes of research on the internet and completely changing my mind, while other people who have seen the same evidence as I have can't get over the fact that the American Dental Association supports it and it must therefore be all happiness and butterflies.

I don't want this to turn into a debate about fluoride or 9/11 or aliens or anything, but it has started to seem to me that an iNtuition preference combined with Thinking allows one to approach any particular topic with an open mind, or more open of a mind than an SF in particular who being an S has already 'evaluated all the evidence' and therefore doesn't need to reevaluate their position.

As I'm sure maybe a few of you are aware, there is a Minecraft Server for INTPs (/r/INTPcraft[1] ). It has been going on for about 2.5 months and has been fairly active. /u/nostalgicBadger26m [+1][2] , the creator, is starting a new server based on the full spectrum of myer-briggs aptly named MBTIcraft.

This server isn't a typical Minecraft server ('vanilla'), as there have been a few modifications made to it. The biggest and most important change is the addition of groups. That's right, you can play with all your xNTP buddies! Keeping this in mind, /u/C4Redalert [3] and I have spent roughly a week designing a Central City to accommodate the different 'factions'. The use of this city is completely optional (go off and make your own city... with blackjack! and hookers!), but the coolest thing about this city is that each faction has its own district within the city walls and only that faction can build there. I'm looking forward to seeing how each town differs, but that's just me.

If you're not too keen on sharing a world with everyone, you can travel to a private world where only your faction can build. People might stop by to take a gander, but you don't have to worry about them touching your stuff. Chase them away with a stick or something! We will also be featuring a currency system as well as shop/lodging rentals. They are features that we hope will help encourage an economy and immersive sense of together-ness, but your experience will not be hindered if you choose not to use them; your experience is what you make of it.

We're not open just yet, but we will be in a week (Friday, 10th@8PM EST) . We do have a subreddit open, /r/mbticraft[4] , and /u/nostalgicBadger26m [+1][5] has a full-fledged website in the works so that we might be able to get our personalitycafe brethren on-board. Please do subscribe, equip some flair, and get ready to rep your type.

I'm not sure what to think of personality typing of any sort, but I've been an INTP since middle school, I've taken the test at least ten times, and the results have never changed.  I've come to terms with the fact that I am a neurotic fucknut with compulsive tendencies, vicious amounts of unnecessary guilt, and a deadly capacity to overthink everything.

I've recently realized that I've got some strengths.  I'm not uninteresting myself, if you're into creative weirdos with never-ending lists of hobbies and penchants for aimless adventures.  My ability to locate and befriend the most vivacious, interesting, driven people in the world is unparalleled.  Retaining these friendships in the long term...well, that's a different story for a different time.  

What I'm here to prod around about today is the more irksome sort of relationship.  I was in one, once - I was nineteen and awkward as fuck and I fell into it on accident and stayed there for four and a half years.  We were friends first, sort of, so I hadn't ever dealt with legitimate dating (although I'd be hard pressed to call anything at nineteen legitimate).

I think it was a fluke.  

It's not that I'm bad at dating, especially via the internet - I'm able to distill the most intriguing bits of my personality down to something weirdly potent and throw it at people that meet my stringent aesthetic and intellectual requirements.  Typically, they respond: I'm half pretty and learning that I can fake charming for long enough.  I've not yet met anyone, in a dating capacity, that doesn't want to see me again.  

Trouble is, I just can't bring myself to do it anymore.  I'm emotionally exhausted after meeting, I can't ever get the rapport going that I hope to, and I eviscerate each and every person I go on a date with in my head to the point where I can't ever see them again.  They're never right, or at least not right enough to warrant a second excruciating effort.  

Is it all just a matter of practicing, of getting to the point where I don't need to drink half a bottle of wine before meeting someone?  I didn't even think about dating for a year and threw myself into things I was passionate about, wandered around on one of those weird life-changing spirit quest monstrosities, and learned some stuff.  I figured I'd try again because, well, I'm a little lonely.  

Anyway, words of advice?  I'm not a romantic, I'm not looking for perfection that isn't out there.  I'm just looking for someone that doesn't have me on edge for hours at a time.

So over the next two weeks, our organization's management has all converged on my office for our annual management team meeting. It's basically a nightmare because:

1. They are all big fat ""E""s so there is sooooo much talking and wanting to make dinner and drink plans and shared accommodation plans so we will basically all be together 100% of the time for the next week.  I want so badly to go away by myself for a little time each day, or to skip out on some of the events but I don't want to look bad to my boss or boss's boss, and worse yet, miss out on some critical conversation that will affect my job. 

2. There will be a lot of decision making, since it is a management meeting and the only time each year when we are all in one place. But obviously as a ""P"" vs a ""J"" I tend to defer on making decisions while seeking new info, so I don't think I'll be comfortable with making quick decisions. Especially since we have gotten little to no agenda for this meeting - if we had I would have prepped and been more comfortable about making decisions. 

Sigh, I don't know what to do. As I type, I am working outside to escape my office, which usually seats 4 and now has about 8 people clamoring and shouting. All of these people are great on a one-to-one basis, but aaaaaaagh, it is TOO MUCH right now.

**HELP. How would you cope?**

_____

**EDIT**: Thanks guys for all your valuable help. Things I read and implemented from your comments:

1. Taking lots of short breaks and errands and working outside for short periods of time to have a breather. Yesterday I left the office early and went for a lovely hour-long pedicure and thus was able to face the evening meetings and drinks that went on till almost midnight. 
2. Preparing points and areas of contribution so that I am not overwhelmed by the E's. I did well on two ""pre-retreat"" meetings today because I'd prepared before hand. 
3. Catching up in smaller groups. Turns out in a group of two or three or four I am witty and conversational. So I've engineered smaller groups and this has really helped face the full group of 16, where otherwise I would have been completely overwhelmed.",,False,,t5_2qhvl,1358369780.0,,,True,t3_16oa00,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/16oa00/currently_facing_an_intp_nightmare/,

I'm guessing some of you may find this to be a strange question to ask a bunch of introverted logical thinkers that pride themselves in being able to keep their emotions detached from most decisions they make in life, and whom strangers and acquaintances probably often even describe as being aloof and oblivious. But the key thing to note is that that's only the majority of the times. However, like all types, we must understand their functional stack to understand them, and Fe (extroverted feeling) is in the functional stack of an INTP. I can't say for all of you (which is why I'm asking the question to begin with), but I for one have on occasions, been at the mercy to the powerful all-or-nothing effects of my inferior Fe function.

During the summer of my senior year in high school, I end up working at a fast food place, because I was too lazy to find a job earlier (go figure). Of course, this was a deeply unsatisfying job, and long story short my boss was a huge douchebag that was always on my ass the entire time, so one day I kind of just snapped, and so I just took off my work shirt, threw it at his face and said ""you know what, fuck you, I quit!"" (verbatim), and walked out; this happened right in front of my other coworkers and the customers. I think the fact that I already grabbed my pay check that day, and also it was nearing the end of summer, so I was going away to college soon, may have subconsciously increased the likelihood of such an unrestrained outburst. But there it is. 

Another time, I was being absent minded while driving, and long story short again, I ended up rear-ending the car right in front of me; what made it worse was that at the time, I was driving without insurance (it was my mom's car, and I didn't usually drive, so the family never bothered to get me insurance); so when it happened, and the driver that I hit stepped out of the car and walking towards me, I just panicked completely, all rational thoughts went out the window, and I just reversed, went around the car, and drove off, the driver got back into the car and tried to follow me, but I ran the red light and got away.

There are other incidents, but I don't feel like going on. I'm not trying to glorify these acts, but merely asking out of curiosity. What I did were stupid and immature, and before I always thought that this was just one of the many quirks to my personality, believing them to be isolated incidents and probably would not happen again. But now I know them to be the result of my underdeveloped Fe function, and that for me to stop pulling these reckless shits, the best thing is for me to develop my Fe function and bring balance to my functional stack. On the bright side though, I think merely knowing the cause of these actions, the underdeveloped Fe function, has already helped me to better control it. Just today, I had an emotional outburst against my mother, who provoked me (even though she believed she was acting in my best interest), so I said something very hurtful to her; immediately after I said it, I realized it to be another outcry from my Fe and immediately apologized to her profusely, telling her I didn't mean it, and it was purely an irrational emotional response, and she soon calmed down. That was basically what lead me to connect the dots on all of my past immature actions and create this thread.

I'd love to hear what your guys' personal experiences and stories are. If you don't got any or don't feel like sharing, then... meh aight cool whatever lol.

1374707081.0,12,self.INTP,1izn70,Anybody here served on a Jury?,14,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1izn70/anybody_here_served_on_a_jury/,"I have been in two and wondered how my experience compared to others.  To me, being questioned in front of the lawyers was not the worst part.  It is being locked up in a small room with 11 other people you barely got to know and have to decide on somebody else’s fate.

**tl;dr**:  The following is just my experience, and asking how it compares to everyone else.  Edit:  I guess a possible AMAA too.

My first trial was only a 15 minute deliberation.  The defendant was accused of animal cruelty when he shot a pitbull… which was attacking his Doberman with his wife nearby.  It literally went like this:

Young adult woman:  “So who should be the foreman?”

Mid-aged man:  “You”

YAW:  “Ooookayyy.  So who thinks he is guilty?”

[No one raise his or her hand]

This was followed by 10 minutes of reviewing the evidence and 4 minutes going, “Jesh, this trial was a waste of all of our time, but are we really done here?”

The other was more proper.  Two brothers were living with an elder who need oxygen.  The two were drunk, got into a fight, the younger went to sleep on a cot, and the older picked up an oxygen tank and just let gravity take over.  His entire face was smashed.     The prosecution wanted murder in the first, the defense self-defense.  The judge did tell us we may rule in favor for 2nd degree and manslaughter.

Now I am very uncomfortable discussing what happened in there for two reasons.  First, we all thought he was guilty, but most of the four hour deliberation was just over the definition of 2nd degree murder, is it applicable, and how it was written in front of us.  Neither side wanted 2nd degree or manslaughter, but they just said, “It is not 2nd degree” without saying why.  We ended up going for 1st degree.  The second reason?  Ends up our foreman happen to know the defendant.  His attorney is challenging the ruling because of it.

In both cases, I had a general idea how I would rule when it started, did voice my opinion when asked, but otherwise spent most of my time either reviewing the evidence and just listening (and observing) the other 11.  It is kinda disappointing that the best part of the trial happens behind closed doors but, as one who’s been there and done that, if what happens in there gets out, I may or may not be good about it.  Deliberating someone else’s fate is nerve wracking to some.  Others who are social control freaks should never get in such of a room.  (Anyone here saw 12 Angry Men?)

The one change I would like is more control over what we can ask.  In trial, we are expected to be seen and not heard.  Meanwhile the lawyers seem to be asking all the wrong questions.  Now granted, this might be pre-trial rulings.  For example, the prosecution cannot bring up the defendant’s criminal past.  In my first trial, the neighbors testified for the prosecution and one juror commented during deliberations, “I suspect those two families hate each other”.  (They were in a car and the daughter was instructed to take photographs of the dogs attacking each other and the pitbull getting shot, while the daughter was in the back seat)  For my second trial, there was one phrase in the 2nd degree murder definition that ANNOYED US COMPLETELY.  Wondering if we did the right thing, I looked up the definition online and never saw this phrase (which I won’t mention here… hey, I have the right to remain silent you know!).  All we got from the judge, with both lawyers beside him, was a non-answer.  Not that it matters.  Regardless, this old man would probably die in jail either way, 1st or 2nd degree.  He ended up with 20 years and will be in his 90s if he lives long enough to get out.

With the recent Zimmerman trial, the juror who almost got a book deal should never, ever be a juror again.  While I have my personal opinion on the trial, what happened behind that closed door is their business only.  I don’t mind if some of the information is leaked, but how and why a decision was made should be guarded unless all 6 are willing to share.  No matter how they ruled, if one disagreed and gets angry about it, I would like to point out to that person you were not there.  More often than not such of a person never was a juror or this social control freak I dread.

So, if you are still reading this, any INTPs went through this?  How was it like?  Do you have different opinions?

Yous?,22,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1hzyce/i_am_not_detached_but_formidably_particular_as_to/,"Time and again it is seen that INTPs identify as detached. Yet - from personal experience (and I can bullshit with the best of them) - a fair portion of the times when others inform me of their perception of such, it's moreso that I am assembling an alchemical articulation for the optimal transmogrification of the whole situation, rather than that I'm cold and dead inside, having nothing to say. 

The thing is... I often see friends' preconceptions stepping in miles before I've chosen any word, and must then deliberate tactically how to pierce most accurately into their respective truth-receptors. Sometimes the ducks line straight up, and a barrage of concise laser-beam light shoots out.. and other times, it's slow and trudging ""here's one sentence,"" take a breath, feel some then formulate more. Though many are not so patient with this, and get frustrated that I'm not ""willing"" to share more - especially when most others are ever so open. 

""Here's a thread,"" I say.
""Ah yes, part of a ball of yarn!"" they exclaim, *knowing* exactly what I'm talking about... but not really. 
""Actually, but one thread of this tapestry - and it's definitely not all this color -- and it might not all be yarn, even."" So they say: ""Dude, why do you have to be so nit-picky?"" And out come their sighs and exclamations. 

My emotions *can be* like the oceans, but with my being a devotee of Truth, if I know you'll hear my words and think/feel other than I intend, and not afford me the necessary opportunities for clarification I'll just keep to the small-talk and spare you from cutting me off a few minutes into your boredom.  

Oh, and none of this even got into *when* to respond, what if there are underlying emotional disturbances that gum up the mind, etc. 

TL;DR - what, you want me to put this into 120 characters maximum?

p.s. hope this all made sense, not used to typing til the birds come up. So... how detached are all y'alls? Is it detachment, or rather you wish for the full reception of your word-fu, and thus the full and proper conveyance of emotions, of your innards?
