2 Days ago on Monday I visited 4Rivers and posted a review which gathered a little over 90 comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/18rwts/4rivers_of_disappointment/
Yesterday, I was contacted through reddit as a private message by a manager that works at 4Rivers asking me to visit them again because they would like to make things better. The manager was very courteous and apologized for my experience. 

Today, I went to the same location on West Colonial, and after I introduced myself I was greeted by the general manager Mike Hernandez, who treated me as if I owned the place. Literally. Mike was very excited about me trying pretty much everything they had on the menu, seriously. This guy should be a politician, seriously you should go there and ask to see him he'll make you want to vote for him somehow. He said he will personally put together a plate for me and that he would like this to be on the house. After nearly 10 minutes of debating with him my refusal to this offer(because that's not what I came back here for) and that I would REALLY like to pay for my food, he accepted and charged me 9$ for this: http://imgur.com/fZnqula

Which was their brisket, handpicked ribs (seriously he turned around and told the guy in the kitchen to give me the juiciest cuts.) and every single side they had. That's 8 sides. 

Redemption. At its best. The brisket........ Aw man. The food, this time, was what I came here the first time for. You hold the rib perpendicular to the tray, you take a fork and you run it down the bone and all the meat falls off. You don't even need a knife for the brisket either because of its tenderness. Everybody agrees including myself from the first time I went there, that the sides are very good, and they were great this time as well. After I could barely finish my tray(s) and find a way to get up and walk, I went over to thank Mike and he introduced me to the Kitchen manager and another manager. I told Mike the only problem this restaurant still has is the fact that I live in Kissimmee.

But this post isn't only about the food. It's about 4Rivers as a restaurant. Here I am, a random guy on reddit, who wrote a post about their restaurant.. And here they are contacting me the next day wanting to make it better, inviting me to their restaurant for an epic meal on them, to gain 1 customer. One. Because they could have easily ignored the post, since I'm like that one guy that yells in Walmart: ""I'm never coming here anymore!"" Well nobody cares, you're just 1. If that's not BRILLIANT customer service, I don't know what is. 4Rivers have definitely   won themselves a customer. But, no more sliders for me...",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_18xtfh,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/18xtfh/4rivers_revisited/,

On Sunday I had made a desperate post on both Reddit and Facebook-Reddit for hands to help me move. I received a lot of initial offers but as the hour approached I began to get less and less confirmations. Thankfully, right around 8am the day of, two guys showed (/u/nelson1805me and /u/aliensheep). We quickly introduced ourselves (one being from Wisconsin and the other being a New York Native) and began the moving process. I believe everyone hit it off perfectly. I am not the biggest fan of moving (it makes me a bit annoyed due to all the competing ideas as to what is the best way to move things; laziness) but working with these guys was easy, to say the least. Everyone moved with speed and was not reluctant to grab the heaviest of things. I felt like I had known these guys for years within minutes.

We finished the first house and made it to the new apartment. There were only two guys that showed up, and that was the perfect amount I thought. On the way to the new apartment I get a message from /u/yoggsoth52 saying that he was on the way (after working a night shift). Three extra hands! YES! By the time we finished all the paperwork /u/yoggsoth52 had made it there full of energy. We began moving the furniture to the third story and, what I assume was the Power of Reddit working a bit too hard, we received help from our neighbors below us! Five extra hands at the exact moment we needed it the most. Those four flights of stairs were brutal, but it never felt like work with the good energy everyone was exuding.

We finished within an hour and everyone was dripping sweat but in great spirits. A quick water/beer break and we were on to my house. The loading was quick, and just as quickly as we arrived at the house, we left the house. We went back to the new apartment and made easy work of getting my cherry-wood dresser up those stairs.

What started at 8am was competed by 12:45 (this includes a trip from Winter Park to UCF; UCF to Golfway and Alafaya (G and A); G and A back to UCF) and what better way to celebrate than with Lazy Moon and a few sandwiches. Over lunch we told stories about our past, weirded out the one Non-Redditor there with our random jokes about Chaucer. The day couldn’t have been any better.

I just wanted to let /r/Orlando know about my personal experience with the Power of Reddit and to acknowledge a few of the awesome people that encompass this city. To everyone can showed up, you saved my life and provided me with great memories and I cannot thank you enough for both of those things. 


Alright, let’s play a game. Each of the the facts listed describes one person in the picture. Can you guess which goes where (answers should be for the person going from left to right. So the girl, then the black guy, then Big Bird...)? 

- One of is the only person dating someone
- One of us has been in Orlando for over 10 years
- The Non-redditor
- One of us use to do Musical Theatre
- One of us spent time in Argentina working with Infectious Diseases

I was told there was an interest in me doing an AMA interview on here. My campaign assistant and I will be on all day fielding your questions about me, the Sheriff race and anything else you can think of.

A quick about me, I'm a 20 year veteran of the NYPD. I recently retired and moved here to Orange county. During my time in New York I served as a hostage negotiator, protected many High Value Targets and patrolled the streets for many years. With me I bring new ideas for crime fighting in the Orange County area. Big city crime needs big city crime fighting techniques to handle them, and I don't think enough has been done by the current Sheriff in that regard. I have been campaigning constantly (you may have seen my billboard up: http://i.imgur.com/Y8QZS.jpg) and hope that your questions and my answers today serve to help in your decisions on voting.

I have made a personal pledge to resign if I am not able to reduce crime by a significant percentage (20%) within my first year as Sheriff. I have also pledged to donate half of my salary to local charities. It is my belief that a Sheriff should be all about serving the community he swears to protect and that this donated money can help that community more than I need it. I also want people to see I am VERY serious about my belief that new strategies can be quickly implemented and be extremely effective in combating crime here.

So please, go ahead and ask me anything!

EDIT: Wow, this really took off more than I expected. I'm going to have to put answering everything on hold until tomorrow. I am on the road a lot today. I apologize, but I think waiting until tomorrow to answer the rest of your questions is for the best. I want to give everyone my fullest attention when I am answering their questions and not leave anyone thinking I am just giving canned answers to try and get them out of the way. I will be back on tomorrow to answer whatever I had to leave from today and any new ones you think of and put up by tomorrow.

Thank you to everyone again for all of their questions. I like seeing there are still many who get involved in local politics.

-Mike Greene

Second Edit: Thank you for all the great questions Reddit. There were a lot more of you than I expected. I hope everyone who asked me questions got what they think is a straight answer from me. Like I said in a few answers, I am not a politician. I am running to be the chief law enforcement officer of your county, and I hope that my experience and promises allow you all to make the right choice. I really liked the broad range of topics you all brought up. The alien attack one got me laughing, thank you for that. Remember to vote! If you don't, your voice cannot be heard.

Amendment 8

Religious Freedom

Synopsis: Amendment 8 revives long-standing 
debates over the separation of church and state. It 
would repeal a 126-year-old provision in the state 
Constitution that prohibits taxpayer funding of 
religious institutions. The provision – commonly 
known as the “no aid” provision – states more 
unequivocally than the U.S. Constitution that state 
funds not be spent “directly or indirectly” in support 
of any entity that promotes religion. If passed, 
the amendment would remove that prohibition. 
An important aspect of Amendment 8 concerns 
its impact on future school voucher programs. 
Past programs that included religiously affiliated 
schools have been deemed unconstitutional partly 
due to the “no aid” provision. Amendment 8 would 
remove that obstacle to restarting these programs, 
which allow parents to remove students from 
failing public schools and send them to private 
schools at taxpayers’ expense. Supporters say the 
“no aid” provision discriminates against religious 
organizations. They argue this proposal offers 
support to groups with religious affiliations that 
provide valuable community services, like prison 
ministries or church-run after-school programs. 
Opponents say Amendment 8 will divert money from 
public schools and other public funding recipients 
and that it blurs the separation of church and state. 
Opponents point out that many religious groups, 
such as Catholic Charities, can receive public 
funding under the current law provided they do not 
promote their religion.

**A vote YES on Amendment 8 would:**

• Repeal the “no aid” provision in the Florida
Constitution and allow public money to go to private 
religious institutions

• Allow the expansion of Florida’s school voucher
program to religious institutions and could result in 
money being directed to private religious schools at 
the expense of public schools

• Allow for a greater number of religious programs to be supported by taxpayer funding

**A vote NO on Amendment 8 would:**

• Maintain the “no aid” provision in the state 
Constitution that prohibits the government from 
funding religious institutions and groups that promote 
religion

• Maintain the constitutional provision the courts have 
cited when rejecting school voucher programs that 
fund religiously affiliated schools

• Maintain the separation of church and state as 
provided by the state Constitution since 1885

I don't know about you guys, but I certainly don't want any of my tax payer dollars to go to any religious institution, program, or organization. On election day please vote no on Amendment 8.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_10mvvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/10mvvn/vote_no_on_amendment_8/,

1367180762.0,75,self.orlando,1dahhq,"I am a doorman/bouncer. Let's talk, bar-goers of Orlando. (bit of a long read)",119,44,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1dahhq/i_am_a_doormanbouncer_lets_talk_bargoers_of/,"My job isn't that hard.  Or, it shouldn't be.  I have what should be one of the easiest jobs in the world.  You walk up, I look at you, I look at your ID, make sure you're over 21, and send you on your merry way.   But maybe it's the alcohol, maybe you think you're a hotshot, I don't know...people seem to want to make this simple, pleasant interaction a challenge.  I've heard from a lot of people that Orlando bouncers have a reputation for being assholes.  I don't wanna be an asshole; I'm like one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  But there are two sides to this coin.  So here's a handy guide on how to make your bouncer at your favorite local watering hole NOT be an asshole:

When I ask you for your ID, please just hand me your ID.  Don't just show it to me, hand it to me.  You are at a bar; this is what people do at bars.  I am not asking anything huge of you.  It's standard practice.   If I ask you to take it out of your wallet, please do so without grumbling or acting like it's a huge imposition.   I don't care how old you think you look, or how young it makes you feel, or how many times you've been here and I should know you by now.  Just be polite and give me your ID.  A lot of bars have a policy where even if you're 80 years old, you have to have your ID to get into the bar. It's an insurance thing.  I may recognize you, or know that you're of age, but I still have to see that yes indeed, you are carrying your ID on your person.  

Please don't be grabby with your ID; some people like to hand it to me, then try to grab it back after two seconds. I see a lot of fakes.  Underagers try to get in all the damn time.  My job is to scrutinize your ID and make sure it is legitimate.  Sometimes you may not look exactly like your ID picture.  Maybe it's an old picture?  Maybe you've changed hairstyles or lost weight?  Regardless, it may take me a few seconds to peruse it.  Don't try to yank it back from me before I'm done, or act impatient because I'm holding you up.  I am doing my job.

""Don't you know me by now?""  Probably not.  I see hundreds of different faces every single night.  I know that you want to feel special, like you're walking into Cheers and everybody knows your name, but so does everyone else.  It's nothing personal, I promise. If my bar is in a crowded area like downtown or just a popular spot? I might see literally *thousands* of faces every single night. My interaction with you is saying hello, checking your ID, and letting you walk into the bar.  It's not like we hang out at the bar and talk, or you tip me, or I remember your drinks.  I see you for, on average, 5-10 seconds.   I will remember you only when I remember you. Unless you MAKE me remember you by being a jackass. Then I'll remember you for being a jackass, and might not let you in.

For the love of fuck, don't make that stupid ""HAHA it's fake!!!"" to anyone's ID.  Yours, your girlfriend's, your buddy's...just don't say it. I've heard that same exact joke probably 50 times in the past *hour*. Everyone says it.  It's not funny, you're not original, you're not making me laugh.  Stop.  

Don't drop names or say ""I know the owner/manager/bartender"" if there's a reason I'm not letting you in. It doesn't work.  Half the people that walk through that door say they know the owner. They may know him, but most do not. I really don't give a shit. It's not getting you anywhere unless the owner himself comes to me and says ""I know these guys, let them in"". If you really DO know the owner? Don't tell me that. Call or text the owner and say ""I'm at the door, please come have your doorguy let me in"".  Don't tell me to call him or text him.  I'll either say no, or I'll fake it, and say ""He said he doesn't know who you are, and he's too busy to come down.""  I hear the same line all the time.  

If I tell you we're full, you cannot change that. Your hot girls that you're hanging with? They won't make there be any less people in the bar. You have friends inside? Awesome, they still take up space, so the bar is still full. And just because people step outside doesn't necessarily mean you can go in. They might have tabs open and plan to come back (going for a smoke, out to their car, making a phonecall, etc). You can go in when I TELL you that you can go in. This is not me going on a power trip or being a dick to you. This is because, surprise surprise, the bar is at capacity.

Lastly, if it's a small bar, please don't show up unannounced at 11:30pm on a friday or saturday with your special party of fifteen to twenty people. Chances are, we're either full or very close to it. Congratulations on your event/birthday/wedding/bachelorette party, and would *love* to accommodate your huge party, but you are coming at the peak of our night, we are likely slammed, and we just CAN'T.  However, if you call ahead that evening, say around 6-8pm? We would be more than happy to hold a place for you. If you're not paying to reserve room, you'd better be on time, though. If you say ""My party is going to be there by 9pm"", be there by 9pm. Otherwise you are costing us money.

Orlando is an awesome city, with some amazing bars.  There's a lot of bouncers/security/doormen out there that really aren't nearly the assholes you think they are.  I'm sure a few of them are absolute dicks, but most of us just want to come in to work, have a good time, and do our jobs.  If you make that easier on us?   You will have a much more pleasant time out at the bar as well, I guarantee it.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_1dahhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1dahhq/i_am_a_doormanbouncer_lets_talk_bargoers_of/,

Edit: 

There's a sign posted at the front of the neighborhood, and a bowl of water set out for them.

Edit 2 8:54pm: The dogs are still there. They almost certainly came from the Park Manor neighborhood. If you live near there, put up a Facebook post or something. If you're willing to try catching them, and foster until the owners come forward, then please PM me.

Edit Saturday: The dogs stayed put overnight, were caught this morning, and are now staying in the home of a kind couple. More signs are up the area. I appreciate all the Upvotes, and hope the owners are found soon.

At about 12:55 am, I was driving south on Hiawassee, right hand lane, going 40 (You know, the speed limit). Just before the 414, I suddenly get slammed forward, feeling very much like one of those crash dummies. By the time I regain my awareness I see a dark SUV (the only other car around) going about 60 past me, and the road curving in front of me. I focus on the latter and didn't get his license plate number.

So I don't really have much of anything to go off of, except that part of the grill was stuck in the rear of my hatchback. Police say I'm SOL without as much as a tag number. I checked the scene for wreckage and all I could find was part of my brake light, so most of his car is probably intact.

So anyway, this is a long shot but if someone sees an SUV matching this could you maybe get its license plate number and PM me? I feel I should return the souvenir they left for me, as that gift was unwanted. Also, so the police can get involved, because that probably drunk-ass motherfucker needs to own up for what he did.

I moonlight a few nights a week at reddit's least favorite joint, Papa Johns. I don't care about the owner or his political snafu but we have a secret coupon for 50%. It has to be used for online orders only. 

FM269 is the coupon code. 

There's some sort of contest where win a prize or something, I don't really know. The coupon code is tied to our store and can be used to order from any store online. I guess it's a test to see how well we can advertise ourselves as employees. 

Maybe the prize will be free health care to all employees... 
Anyway, it's the best deal going on right now and could hopefully put a little more cash in my fellow drivers' pockets as well. 

[I've already tested it to see if it works.](http://i.imgur.com/eiGNCYn.png) 
edit: this is not the store I work at. 
edit2: the coupon doesn't stack with other deals. but still gives the best financial value. 
edit3: use at many times as you want. 27th is the last day.

note: it doesn't take 50% off the delivery charge unfortunately.  
  
Edit4: I apologize if its not working for some people. This is all the info I got. You can try calling the online support line for additional help.  
If that doesn't work you can try calling up the store in your area and ask for their unique only code. The guys at my store offer over the phone almost every call.  
**edit5**: for those you said they couldn't get it, the next time I go into my night shift I'll look up a coupon code in the system and PM you guys. it'll probably be something like 1 1-topping pizza for $7.99. it'll be a call in coupon only and you'll have to read them the coupon number over the phone.  
  
**edit6**: it appears it may only work for corporate owned stores. sorry, i'm not sure which ones those are. you can try ordering on the phone and using this coupon code LG1799. it's a large 1 topping for 7.99. but I have no control of franchise stores since they're individually owned...",,False,,t5_2qh7s,1368840672.0,,,True,t3_1egex4,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1egex4/i_moonlight_delivering_pizza_in_orlando_a_few/,

Though it says it's non-partisan, as with everything on the internet, assume there may be a little bias in the description of these amendments.**

**Amendment 1**

**Health Care Services**

 **Synopsis:** Amendment 1 is more of a political referendum than a meaningful change to our Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has upheld the federal government’s right to impose the individual mandate, the legal standing of Amendment 1 is precarious. The passage or defeat of Amendment 1 may have no practical implications other than to send a message that a majority of Florida’s voters are either for or against the individual mandate.

**A vote YES on Amendment 1 would:**

• Represent an attempt to opt Florida out of federal health care reform requirements

• Add language to the Florida Constitution that could be found unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution if determined by the courts to be in conflict with federal law

• Prevent the Florida Legislature from passing health care coverage mandates independent of federal law

**A vote NO on Amendment 1 would:**

• Mean that Florida should comply with federal health care reform requirements

• Ensure that the Florida Constitution does not conflict with the U.S. Constitution with regard 
to health care coverage

• Not prohibit Florida lawmakers from passing state laws requiring health care coverage

**Amendment 2**

**Veterans Disabled Due to Combat Injury; Homestead Property Tax Discount**

 **Synopsis:** Amendment 2 relaxes the eligibility requirements for an existing property tax discount offered to disabled veterans. Currently, disabled veterans who meet the following four requirements are eligible for a property tax discount commensurate with the degree of their disability: 1) current Florida resident; 2) 65 or older; 3) disabled in combat; 4) Florida resident when they entered the military. If passed, Amendment 2 would eliminate that fourth eligibility requirement. As an example of how it works, a veteran eligible for the discount with a 50 percent disability can claim 50 percent off the assessed value of his 
home. Roughly 1,200 veterans received that discount in 2010, allowing them to subtract, on average, $24,000 from their home’s value before property taxes were calculated. This proposed amendment would give that same tax break to veterans, age 65 and older, who were disabled in combat but living in another state when they entered the military so long as they now claim Florida residency. The state estimates that if Amendment 2 passes, school districts and local governments would lose a total of $15 million over the first three years.

**A vote YES on Amendment 2 would:**

• Give the existing homestead tax exemption to disabled veterans who were not Florida residents at the time they entered military service

• Reduce property tax revenue for schools and local government services by an estimated total of $15 million over the first three years

• Expand the property tax exemption for some disabled veterans who are not currently eligible for a similar property tax exemption

**A vote NO on Amendment 2 would:**

• Not expand the property tax exemption to disabled veterans who were not Florida residents at the time they entered military service

• Not reduce property tax revenue for schools and local government services by an estimated $15 million over three years

• Not place a limitation on state revenue in the Florida Constitution where it would be difficult to modify or remove

**Amendment 3**

**State Government Revenue Limitation**

 **Synopsis:** Since 1995, Florida has set a cap for the amount of revenue it can spend every year from taxes and fees imposed on everything from gasoline and tobacco sales to business licenses and auto titles. Any excess revenue above the cap is to be deposited in the state’s rainy day fund or returned to taxpayers rather than be spent by the government. The cap is considered by its backers to be a self-imposed restraint on government growth. The current cap is set using a formula based on changes in Florida personal income (a cumulative total of all personal earnings such as wages, dividends, rent or interest income received in a given year by Florida residents). To date, state revenue collections have never exceeded the cap (largely due to rising personal income and falling tax rates). If passed, Amendment 3 would impose a stricter formula for calculating the revenue limit and, as a result, increase the likelihood it would affect government spending. The new formula would be based on annual population growth and inflation, instead of personal income. Those indicators are considered less volatile than personal income growth and more likely to constrain growth in state revenues. Critics fear the strict revenue limits would affect spending on necessary services like schools and public safety. According to one opposition group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the proposed amendment would result in allowable revenues 26 percent below pre-recession levels (2006-07) by 2025, potentially resulting in major cuts to all government services. Supporters say the cap is needed to limit government spending.

**A vote YES on Amendment 3 would:**

• Replace the existing state revenue limitation based on personal income growth with a new, more restrictive limitation based on changes in population and inflation

• Restrict government revenue (taxes, licenses, fees, fines or charges for services) in good and poor economic times

• Limit the Legislature’s ability to increase revenue beyond what the formula allows

**A vote NO on Amendment 3 would:**

• Maintain the existing state revenue limitation based on personal income 
growth

Yes I have filed a police report and I have renters insurance I also have some of the serial numbers written down. I know that most likely the preps will go unpunished and I will not recover my items. But I was hoping that if you were in the market for some of the stuff that was stolen you could give me a heads up to anything suspicious.

* Nikon D7000 with Lens
* Kindle Fire in a pink case
* Sony PS3, Fat, Backwards
* PSP White (Star Wars Edition)
* XBOX 360 Elite with Kinect
* 47"" LCD TV Vizio 1080p
* Nintendo DS Lite, Coral(Light Pink)
* Samsung Camcorder
* About 43 games (Full Collection of Sims, PS3 and 4 Xbox Games)
* Lots of liqour

For the past year or so, I have pestered you all once per semester, trying to find patients for dental hygiene school at Valencia's West campus.  Well, this is my last round.  I am finally graduating!

I have met so many amazing people through this subreddit, and you guys have been amazing patients for me.  Once school is finished, I may be able to *gasp* socialize!  Until then, I still need patients.

Message me for more details, but here are the basics:
I am in clinic Tuesdays and Thursdays.  It is on West Campus, off Kirkman Road in the MetroWest area.  It is an amazing facility, with awesome equipment, and the cleanings are much more thorough than your average dental office, because we are being graded.

The cleaning, exam, etc. is $20, but we are not able to take insurance.  If you need x-rays, that is an additional $20 (if you want them), but everything else is included, such as Fluoride treatment, local antibiotics if you need them, stain removal, etc., etc.  

Also, I have last minute openings for tomorrow at 8:30am and Thursday at 8:30am.  If you can make either of those and get back to me tonight, I will pay for your appointment.  If you have a child or teen who will come in for a cleaning, I will also pay for them, and that is for anytime before May.  (first come, first served on those!) If you can bring me a child or teen patient tomorrow at 8:30, I'll pay for them *and* give you a kick-ass high five.  Cause that would rock my whole life right now.

Thank you! You make Orlando a better place to live in.

I heard the collision and saw the trees rustle sitting at the light on Hall waiting to cross over to Howell Branch. I couldn't get over safely but I saw at least 3 trucks pull into the gas station and rush to help. Several others pulled onto the sidewalk. As I passed I saw the car had made it most of the way up the tree and people were there to help. 

I hope the driver is ok and I hope nobody was on the bike trail when it happened. I was trying to figure out how to get to him but so many people were there I knew I would just be in the way at that point.

Anyway, thanks for helping someone in need without a second thought. You make Orlando awesome.

I live off Alafaya and Colonial in Orlando, Florida. Something horrible happened to me Saturday afternoon. My apartment was robbed of almost everything..I came home from the pool with my friend (only left the house for an hour) and quickly we noticed everything in her purse had been dumped on the floor. We searched the house like crazy for a good 5 minutes. I ended up in the living room trying to catch my breath. I looked down at my entertainment center for a moment. I saw a square indentation on my floor. I widened my eyes and screamed like I've never screamed before. My roommate and friend rushed in. I yelled ""WHERE'S MY FUCKING XBOX?!!?!??"" Immediatly I ran into my room. I found my purse (that had 600$ cash in it because I was paying bills in person at amscot that day), watch that my grandmother bought me, AND my iPad2 had been stolen.. It really sucks and I am very scared and vulnerable. I dont know how they got in because all the doors were locked. I did see my window screen had been cut and the frame was bent. I'm sure they jimmy rigged it and got in. I am really suffering right now because that 600 dollars was all for rent/bills/car insurance/ and now I am going to be in big trouble with all my accounts. I'm so frustrated. I feel really lost without my stuff, especially my wallet and Xbox..I've had it for 4 years...they took all of my games that included- 
MW2
Black ops
Gears2
fallout new vegas
portal2
orange box
lego batman
+
a bunch of star wars original xbox games

at least they were nice enough to not take my N64. =/

I don't know what this post will do, really, I just want to see if anyone has seen a bundle of stuff like this being sold at a pawn shop or a gamestop..I'm really hurt and scared like I said. Any information helps. Even if you don't know how to help- words of people that have been robbed will do amazing things for my fear. I just feel so lost.
 
THANK YOU REDDIT. &lt;3


TL;DR
My apt was robbed yesterday. I live off Alafaya and Colonial.
They took My
Xbox 360(black)- controller, headset, a bunch of games.
16gb iPad2- brand new
My purse that had my wallet with 600$ in it.
and my roomies laptop- Toshiba.

Thanks so much for all the advice!! I really appreciate this.

""If you have or know a person with a white dirty suburban that went to the convention center and were towed behind Walgreens... We have pictures of the tow truck damaging your car and taking off. We called the police but they said there was nothing we could do. That the victim wasn't there and they can't notify them. Here's me notifying you. I have pictures of the plate numbers etc. for you. I will get the name of the company asap.""

Please let me know if you are, or know, this person so I can put you in contact with the individual who has the photos!

EDIT: I've contacted my friend asking for the photos of the damaged part of the suburban. Unfortunately, my friend and I both feel, for obvious reasons, that posting a photo of the victim's tag online is a terrible idea. I did mention to her that there may be ways to find the owner online through having the tag ID though, so I'm sure she will be trying that avenue to contact them as well.

We were a small group compared to other meet ups I've read about, but we had a great time and were able to catch up with several other /r/orlando members who work at the parks throughout the day.

As much as we enjoyed the Butter Beer and roller coasters, the highlight of the day was a private meet and greet with several of the superheroes over in Marvel Island. I've been asked not to disclose the identity of the AMAZING person who made this happen for us (because, you know, SUPERHEROES), but I want to share this photo with you all :-)

Should you happen to agree with me, your upvotes on that post would be appreciated. 

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to seeing lots of you at our [Global Reddit Meet Up Day event] (http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1e1gat/official_rorlando_global_reddit_meetup_day/) on June 15th and at the next UO/IOA meet up (date TBD).

- Lake Eola
- [Food truck pods](http://www.thedailycity.com/p/orlando-food-trucks.html)

1344355432.0,43,self.orlando,xttxa,Are you looking for a volunteer opportunity?,47,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/xttxa/are_you_looking_for_a_volunteer_opportunity/,"Hi, I'm Heather :)  I run the Volunteer Advocates for Children program as part of the Guardian ad Litem program of Orange County.

That's a lot of words that don't mean anything to most people.

Basically, we help kids who have been victims of abuse or neglect and are now in the dependency system.  

A Guardian ad Litem is a legal advocate for the child in his or her case.  The GAL serves the ""best interest"" of the child, so they're the ones who advocate for services in every area of their life so they can succeed: education, psychological, psychiatric, etc.  The GAL is like their champion.

In Orange County, all of our GALs are licensed attorneys.  We're different from all the other counties in Florida that way, and we did it that way because who can better advocate for a child in court than a lawyer?

But because our lawyers also have private practices to attend to, sometimes they can't do the ""leg work"" involved with their case.  The leg work in this situation is to go and visit the child and find out what's going on in their life.  How are they doing in school?  How are they doing where they're living?  Are they having any trouble whatsoever?  What are their goals, and how can we help them achieve those goals?

This is where the VAC (Volunteer Advocate) comes in.  As a VAC, you act as a friend, confidante, mentor, reporter, and advocate for a child who needs it.

It is an excellent opportunity for students who may have service learning requirements for college, or for law, social work, or mental health undergrads/graduate students.  HOWEVER, anyone can be a VAC!  I have bankers, PR, realtors, etc., you name it.  All you have to be is willing! 

It is only a one-hour commitment per month!  If this sounds interesting to any of you, please email me at hbrangwin@legalaidocba.org.  I'd love to hear from you all!

&gt; [Audobon Park Community Market](http://apmarket.wordpress.com/)
_(Winter Park/Audobon Park)_

_When:_ Monday 6:00PM - 10:00PM

_Where:_ Stardust Coffee ([map](http://g.co/maps/xxfw5)).

Awesome selection of fresh local food, crafts, soaps, jewelry, etc. As a bonus, [Big Wheel](http://bigwheeltruck.com/) is usually out there serving food. I usually get eggs, milk, sea food (every other week from Wild Ocean), and occasionally some dessert from Bee's Knees there. 


&gt; [College Park Farmer's Market](https://www.facebook.com/pages/College-Park-Farmers-Market/330587853090) _(College Park)_

_When:_ Thursday 5:00PM - 9:00PM

_Where:_ Infusion Tea ([map](http://g.co/maps/vtamm)).

Very similar to the Audobon Park market though not quite as packed. Infusion Tea is pretty cool, too.


&gt; [Sand Lake Farmer's Market](http://www.sandlakefarmersmarket.com/) _(Dr. Phillips/Sand Lake)_ 

_When:_ Saturday 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Dr. Phillips and Sand Lake Road([map](http://g.co/maps/zqpgk)).

I haven't been to this one but it looks pretty good.



&gt; [Winter Park Farmer's Market](http://www.cityofwinterpark.org/Pages/Visitors/Shopping_Dining_and_More/Saturday_Farmers_Market.aspx) _(Winter Park)_

_When:_ Saturday 7:00AM - 1:00PM

_Where:_ 200 West New England Ave, Winter Park, FL ([map](http://g.co/maps/e95y9)). 

Tons of stuff at this one: milk, eggs, meat, cotton candy, vegetables (watch out, not all organic), honey, fruit, vanilla, candy corn, plants, coffee, etc. There are a bunch of spots to get freshly made drinks like lemonade and orange juice. [Winter Park Dairy](http://www.winterparkdairy.com/) is usually out there, too, and their cheese is amazing. Make sure to check out the always entertaining local honey guy.

&gt; [Orlando Farmers Market](http://www.orlandofarmersmarket.com/index.html) _(Downtown)_

_When:_ Every Sunday except holidays from 10am to 4pm

_Where:_ Lake Eola, just outside Stardust lounge ([map](http://g.co/maps/7exve)).

This is a larger market. You will find fresh produce and vegetables, lots of prepared food to eat, snacks, beverages, etc. This is more of an event to go to. Lots of great food but not as much fresh food as the Audobon/College Park/Winter Park markets. It's more ""shoppy"" then the other markets.

&gt; [Central Park Farmer's Market](http://www.lakemaryfarmersmarket.com/) _(Lake Mary)_

_When:_ Saturday's from 9:00AM - 1:30PM

_Where:_ Lake Mary City Hall ([map](http://g.co/maps/4zc8s)). 

I've passed by this one a couple of times when I used to go to the little organic market that was open there. Looks like a good family spot with some snacks, plents, coffee, crafts, and a little bit of food. 

&gt; [Sanford Farmers Market](http://www.sanfordfarmersmarket.com/Sanford_Farmers_Market/Welcome.html)

_When:_ Saturday from 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ East 1st St &amp; Magnolia Ave, Sanford ([map](http://g.co/maps/zxdxm))

I haven't been to this one but it looks like there's a lot of food, cheese, some plants, soaps, honey, etc.


&gt; [Maitland Farmers Market](http://www.itsmymaitland.com/community-events.aspx?a=viewPost&amp;PostID=13022) _(Maitland/Lake Lilly)_

_When:_ Sunday from 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Lake Lilly Park ([map](http://g.co/maps/v5cbe))

There is one at Lake Lily in Maitland. It was a decent size (smaller than at Eola) with neat finds like homemade dog treats. Haven't been in a couple years so here's more recent info: http://www.yelp.com/biz/maitland-farmers-market-maitland. - Thanks wanderingwanton in the comments!

&gt; [Kissimmee Main Street Farmers Market](http://www.localharvest.org/kissimmee-main-street-farmers-market-M3490) _(Kissimmee)_

_When:_ Year round, Thursdays, 7:00AM - 1:00PM

_Where:_ Darlington and Pleasant Street, Kissimme, FL ([map](http://g.co/maps/k6yz8))

Not a lot of info on this one on the web but check it out if you're local.

&gt; [Clermont Farmers Market](http://clermontdowntownpartnership.com/farmers-market)
_When:_ Every Sunday 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Montrose Street, Downtown Clermont ([map](http://g.co/maps/sjx6g))

Fresh produce, breads and bakery items, honey, seafood, Amish jams and jellies, pasta, fresh baked scones, Italian olive salad and baked veggie chips. You will also find hanging baskets and assorted outdoor plants, hand rolled cigars, a select assortment of artwork, craft and jewelry items and much more. The Market always has festive foods like kettle corn, BBQ and hot dogs to munch on while you shop. - Thanks Varion!

&gt; [Waterford Lakes Farmers Market](http://www.waterfordlakesfarmersmarket.com/)

_When:_ Saturdays 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Waterford Lakes Town Center ([map](http://g.co/maps/xej2v))

Mostly live music, arts &amp; crafts, pet supplies, plants, some food and produce.

I feel like I'm missing some here. I had thought that there was one or two on the east side near UCF/Waterford but the only info I could find said the UCF one is closed. I'm not sure if the Waterford market still goes on. Anyone know?

**It's always a good idea to check the web site or facebook page of the market before heading out there just in case it gets cancelled or something.**

Note: I may turn this in to a blog post on my friend's Orlando food blog at some point.

This means whichever restaurant has the most franchises wins. **End of story**. Employees go online and click vote, 1 2 3... 5 or 6 times. They tell every single person who goes in to their store to vote as well. They print out little signs. Even if only 1 in 1000 actually DOES, it's still more than the mom and pop could ever hope to get with their one measly store. 


Last year I was chatting with the owner of That Deli! in Lake Mary, and he was saying how hard it was for a single restaurant to compete with TooJays in the *Orlando Weekly* listing (deli category) because of the number of outlets they have.


This doesn't prove Orlandoids are stupid, have poor taste, etc. This just proves the Sentinel are literally **pants on head retarded**. I'm serious. Walk into their offices, you will see at least one person with their pants on their head, maybe from retarded, maybe stress from watching their industry implode. 

It would actually be difficult to find a WORSE way to gauge the best stores and eateries in Orlando. Possible, I'm sure, but very difficult.

Nearly 10K out of pocket over the last decade and I am no closer to locating my brother than when I started looking. He was 3 when I was born. I was placed with the state, he remained with my birthfamily. I doubt he knows I exist. I've hired private detectives, placed months-long ads in the Sentinel, scoured ancestry registries and message boards and picked through old birth announcements. Nothng. (I am also stuck in Texas, which makes remote searching very difficult) I have registered with the Florida Soundex (for people involved with adoption) and have been for years. The adoption was closed up tight and I have very little information to go from. 

All I want to do is find my older brother (I would gladly meet any member of my biological family, though). I was born at ORMC in late January of 1982 to a married woman who was 20. My brother was three at the time and not placed for adoption. My father was early 20's. Any help anyone at all can provide would be so appreciated. I was placed through Children's Home Society. I have no names and only an amended birth certificate.  I am so ready to get past this, 10+ years of looking has been exhausting and heartbreaking.

We have a fair supply of Alcohol (in case you don't want to bring your own) We will cook! (I will be grilling all sorts of things and sister will likely be baking ambrosia, but again we would appreciate people bringing their own food too!), You will be welcome to stay the night (New years drivers are to be avoided and also alcohol is fun!), And we're located near the UCF campus, so if you want to avoid crowds and just have new years with other Redditors and miscellaneous awkward nerds Send me a message here or send me an Email at Whatsimplethings@gmail.com, and I'll shoot you over the address. 

(I will also provide tobacco upon request, I smoke a pipe and Cigars for parties) 


EDIT: People can show up about as early as they want to, lets just say 8-9 o clock for no real reason what so ever.  So really whenever anyone wants to come.

EDIT EDIT: A lot of people (seriously like a lot of you) have asked me if this is ent friendly, honestly I don't care what you do, but the apartment itself is smoke free, but there is a good place to partake right outside!

EDIT EDIT EDIT: THINGS I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED TO EVERYONE: 


1: My name is Jonathan. Hello.

2: The Apartment is D

3: I have no idea how to throw a party so I'm just getting a lot of food and alcohol and throwing it at you and hoping it works out.

4: Bring whatever party music is. I have no idea what party music is.

5: I hate my neighbors. This is not a warning but rather an encouragement.

6: I hope you guys actually show up and this isn't some elaborate prank by the popular kids. Those damned popular kids.

- Furniture
- Large area rugs
- Glasses
- Bone china (cups and tea pots)
- Silver teapots
- Art
- Guitars
- Row machine
- DVD's, Blu-ray's, CD's and XBOX games
- Books
- and much, much more

For creepy internet reasons, we won't be adding our direct address on here. However, I'll give some easy-peasy directions. We live in College Park, on Guernsey Street, directly off of Edgewater Drive. Look for Infusion Tea (next to the Dollar Tree) that is on the corner of Edgewater and Guernsey. Turn down Guernsey and you won't miss us (trust me). We will also have signs up on Edgewater in cute little planting pots. 

PS: We collect empty wine bottles. Please please please please (please) bring us your empty wine bottles; or full ones, that's cool with us too ;). If you do, we will take 50 cents off your total per bottle. We make cool things with them, and are currently making a wine bottle garden border.

- A dresser or something to put all these clothes in!  
- Size 12 shoes / flip flops

THANK YOU to everyone who has offered to help. I'm blown away by the response. The survivor can't believe so many people want to help him, he told me to stop because he will have too much! Much love to all of you for the incredible support and welcoming him to Orlando. This is like a dream come true! :)

Hi /r/Orlando, I hope it's ok I post here. I started /r/troubledteens to save kids from being [tortured and abused by the 'troubled teen' industry](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/l7r94/welcome_rfirstworldproblems_if_you_are_like_most). 

A survivor of torture has recently relocated to the Orlando area, a local advocate is helping him to get established. [His story is heartbreaking](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/ho9hn/repost_for_our_new_readers_for_3_years_teen_was/), as a teen he was held in complete isolation for up to 8 months at a time, he made up friends to talk to in order to survive the ordeal. He had committed no crime, he had not been sentenced there by a judge.

Amazingly enough, he has turned out to be a wonderful person, he now advocates online to make sure no kid ever goes through what he did. He is one of the hardest working advocates I know, he has helped many people.

He has a place to live but almost no belongings. He has one pair of shorts, a few pairs of pants, and some flip-flops that are being held together with safety pins. He is currently sleeping on the carpet. He has a little money, enough to get him through the month, but he's lacking in some basic creature comforts. 

If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated. He lives near the main airport but the local advocate can help with rides. 

Here are his sizes:

Shorts: Large

Pants: 34 waist

Shirts: L or XL

Shoes: 12

An outreach agency may be able to help him with furniture next week, but until then he has nothing to sleep on. Even a loan of an air mattress would help. I'm also concerned with possible bedbugs if they give him a mattress, I trust reddit more. If anyone has an extra mattress or bedroom furniture they are getting rid of anyways, that would be great, but plan B is in place if not.

Additionally, he has a donated bike, but the chain is rusted and there are no brakes. If anyone can help with minor bike repair, that would be huge.

Also, read up on what a hackerspace is!: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace

We got a brand new space that is OVER 4000!...sq/ft that is.  We want to show it off.  We want to show YOU what we have in store.

The new space allows a lot more opportunity for us to teach classes we've wanted to teach for a long time.  You've seen me, or abyssknight post here telling you about our Arduino or Soldering classes, but we're going to be doing cooler stuff soon too!

Here's a quick rundown of some ideas we've had for classes:    

* Screen Printing
* Welding
* Laser Cutting (We own a laser cutter!)
* HAM Radio
* Analog circuitry
* Photography
* Python/Ruby classes
* NodeJS classes
* Metalworking classes (Lathe, CNC mill, Manual Mill)
* Pottery? (We've got a kiln!)

And some of our ideas for projects in the new space:

* Retro Game Night! (Original NES, SNES, Playstation, N64, Sega)
* Green Screen for video processing
* Wheatley-style service rail with camera accessible from the internet.
* Quadcopter battles
* Solar/Wind power
* DJ Booth
* Maybe let an artist come in and paint the interior?

The NEW address for FamiLAB is **1355 Bennett Drive #129, Longwood FL 32750** -- we're not at the dinky old 400 sq/ft place anymore!  We'll be holding our open house **December 6th at 8:00pm**.  There *will be cookies!*

Come and check out the new place!  We're super excited about it, but even if you don't plan on making it out, post here on any ideas or thoughts you might have, or what kind of classes you might be interested in!  We're all about learning new things, teaching, and providing access to tools most people normally don't have access to.

Also, this is for most ages!  Bring your middle/high school kids too!  We (and by we I mean one of our board members) also run a YoungMakers program which is geared toward teaching the younger generation how to make things!  It's fun for everyone!

We're on IRC as well.  Freenode, #familab -- it's where the most devious of our members hang out. :)

I decided I'd throw together a quick post from my experiences with living in Orlando &amp; dealing with a city consistently ranked in the Top 25 Cities with the Most Speed Traps.

**General Tips for Driving:**

* If you're driving on any highway, try to tail a ""rabbit"" car approximately 250 yards back. A ""rabbit"" car means a car that is driving over the speed limit, faster than you &amp; preferably in the left most lane.

* Think like a cop. Scout a ways ahead of you on the roadway for sudden brake lights. This is usually a good indication of drivers coming across a police unit. Be wary of any ""hills"" in the road way, overpasses or turns that would conceal a police vehicle.

* If you see a police vehicle on the side of the road with it's lights on, move over a lane. They regularly run stings to make sure you're moving over for emergency vehicles.

* Take note of where speed traps are normally setup. Nine out of ten times police will have a routine trap area that they work on &amp; off over the course of a month.

**What to do if you're caught:**

* Immediately Pull Over. 
* Roll down your windows (this will sometimes circumvent an additional tint ticket.) 
* Turn off your radio &amp; move your key to the off position. 
* If pulled over at night also turn on your inside dome light. It helps the officer see into the vehicle from your rear window, especially if you have decent tint. It takes a lot of apprehension out of their duty. (Thanks /u/EvolLanA!)
* Sit still until the officer approaches your vehicle. 
* Be polite &amp; use yes sir/mam &amp; no sir/mam. 
* Do not admit to anything! Do not state why you were speeding. Do not state your speed. Why? Have you ever noticed that a cop will remain on the side of the road after the other vehicle has left? They jot down notes of their conversation with you in case they need to appear in court. You want to make this write-up go smoothly so they will barely remember the experience.

**Red Light Tickets:**

If you are at an intersection with a red light camera that gets you, there are a couple of notices that you get. The first notice asks for money and isn't a ""real"" ticket. It's basically a warning saying that this isn't a ticket but if you ignore it then it will become one and will be twice the amount of money to pay. If you don't feel like taking this one to a lawyer then this is a good time to pay. If you do take it to a lawyer, you need to wait until the second, ""real"" ticket comes in. (Thanks /u/drjrock!)



**Ticketed, Now What Are My Options?**

1.) Pay Ticket, receive points.

2.) Take Traffic School, pay ticket, no points.

3.) Hire a Traffic Attorney.

4.) Appear in Court.

Personally I'd recommend number three. Usually prices for civil infraction tickets cost $89-$109. For that price, you will never have to appear in court as a lawyer will do so for you. If you have a clean record &amp; the speed you were caught at wasn't extravagant, then that's usually all you'll pay. Rarely will you have to pay court fees (usually ~$140) or be ordered to attend traffic school. **The way a lawyer is able to ""circumvent"" the system is due to the fact that the legal system is flawed. The local prosecutors would rather dismiss a case where an individual has legal representation &amp; move on to a quick open/shut case where an individual is willing to freely admit guilt &amp; pay.**

If you decide to attend Traffic School, realize that you not only have to pay for the class but you'll also have to pay the full price of the ticket. The upside is that the points are waived.

Here are the notes on Traffic School from the FDOT's [page](http://dotstrafficschool.com/eligibility.htm):

&gt; After receiving a Florida Traffic ticket, you need to contact the Clerk of the Court in the county where you received the ticket to find out the reduced amount you need to pay when attending Traffic School or this amount might be with the information the officer gave you when you were stopped. Once you have identified the amount of the payment, send it in along with the ticket and a school election form (Affidavit) to the appropriate address. Again see the Clerks of Court link if you need the payment address or a school election form.

&gt;1. You are eligible to attend traffic school once every 12 months as an election.

&gt;2. You may be able to attend more frequently than once every 12 months, but it must be Judge ordered.

&gt;3. You may be able to attend the 8 hour program if you have already completed the 4 hour program within the past 12 months. Unlike the 4 hour program which has statewide approval, eligibility for the 8 hour program varies depending on the county where the ticket was issued. Please contact the clerk of court in the county in which you received the ticket to see if you are able to complete the 8 hour program.

&gt;4. You may only attend traffic school 10 times in your lifetime.

&gt;5. You may attend our on-line traffic school or take the video at home course instead of an actual in-class traffic school. It counts just the same!

I walk in and see a great selection of synthetic wigs.... but they were ALL priced in the hundreds. I estimated one wig for $45.00 being sold at $275! I felt sick. I wouldn't pay more than $70 dollars for even the best synthetic wig she had. She was marking up prices past 100%!

I kept browsing and pretended that I was a naive customer. I asked her if this was a good price. She went on telling me how I was getting a great deal. All I could think of was how disturbing it was to take advantage of people in such a vulnerable insecure time of their lives. 

She charged a fee of $10.00 to try on two wigs. I politely declined and left. What a scam. Please if you know someone who is into hair pass this info along.

I still very much consider it my home, and I truly love Central Florida.  My mother was a native Floridian from Orlando, and most of my mother's side of the family have always lived there.

Growing up was filled with days and actions that could only be described as pure Central Florida: swimming at Wekiva Springs, seeing the manatees at Blue Springs, canoeing and snorkeling in Crystal River, fishing Lake Harney/Jessup/Monroe (Jesus, any Central Florida river/lake/creek/retention pond), day trips to St. Augustine, hiking in the woods, swimming and boogie boarding at New Smyrna, etc.  Trips to Disney were supplemented with Florida attractions like Gatorland, Mystery Fun House, and Weeki Wachi Springs.  All the while, my mother or father would drive telling me ""This all used to be orange groves.""

It was a perfect place for my childhood, and though I know Orlando (and Florida in general) has some issues and problems...well, so does just about every place.

I've noticed that, as an ex-Floridian from Orlando, I've found myself defending it non-stop since moving (first to NYC, then to Austin).  Common statements I hear:

""Oh my God, I could never live there.""

""Disney's so gross.""

""I went there on vacation and can't believe people actually live there.""

""Florida...that's where all the trashiest/weirdest/craziest news stories come from.""

Hell, even 30 Rock used Florida as the butt of a number of jokes.  

I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had to deal with this while living outside of Orlando or Central Florida, and how you respond?  Because I'm constantly saying, ""It's not all Disney,"" ""It's not as conservative as, say, 95% of Texas or New York,"" etc. 

Maybe I'm weird because I love Central Florida (flaws and all), but I can't be the only one...


TL;DR   Does anyone else feel like you constantly have to defend the city you're from?  I love Florida, but in conversations about hometowns I'm always on the defensive.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_1hn9d5,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1hn9d5/as_an_exorlando_resident/,

I used to do a few meet ups around this time last year and during the summer, and going downtown over the last couple of days has made me miss social interaction. So let's meet!

This is in continuation to the other thread that deathbysnusnu is starting. For those that can't make it for Friday, I'd like to propose we meet up in Saturday evening, downtown maybe? Or something else! While I do know that there may be underage redditors, keep that in mind when you suggest a place to hang out.

We can meet up downtown and bar hop, go canoeing at Wekiva Springs or bowl at Firkin &amp; Keglers, whatever. Just drop some ideas and whatever gets the most votes, wins.

Thoughts?

**EDIT #1:** So it looks like an overwhelming Wekiva Island/Springs vote. Wayyy cool! Here are some details that we should probably throw down first then:

- **Let's meet up at 11am.** People can still get some sleep from the night before but it's not too late to do anything. I'm going to research a bit more today on a possible meeting area/pavilion that we can congregate at. I'll update you all. I know there are some that may be there a bit later. If so, PM me directly and I will give you my cell # to contact me at.

- **Wekiva Island or Springs?:** Wekiva Island is located in Longwood and Wekiva Springs is located in Apopka. Weird, isn't it? Wekiva Springs you do not have to pay as much but there are less amenities. Wekiva Island is like having a full bar on the river with a nicer view of things and yes there is also canoeing and non-alcoholic drinks. Here is the website for both and I'll let you all decide. Personally I wanna try Wekiva Island but I want to hear what you all have to say:

http://wekivaisland.com/ - Wekiva Island
http://www.floridastateparks.org/wekiwasprings/aboutthepark.cfm - Wekiva Springs

- **BYON (Bring Your Own Noms):** I'm going to try and get a space where we can also BBQ at, and just chill out at. In the mean time, bring your typical picnic-y food items (hamburgers, hot dogs, starches, beer, etc) so that way we're not all starved by the end of the day or paying when we just don't need to.

**EDIT #2** The biggest edit of all: cost. 

~~Wekiva Springs costs $79.88 to hold a pavilion and that is only the cost of the pavilion.~~ We don't actually need a pavilion to BBQ but I will update you guys with where exactly our picnic table will be. Entrance fees are $6 per vehicle with 8 people a vehicle.

Wekiva Island is $100 to hold a cabana/pavilion but I do not see an entrance fee. 

Keep these prices in mind when you make a decision :)

**EDIT #3** All right so, apparently I'm getting downvoted every which way everywhere in r/Orlando except this post. Deathbysnusnu and I did not plan this and meh, I guess we could have done it better. But here's the thing, if you've PMed deathbysnusnu being upset about another meet-up popping out of no where, why? We are two groups of people doing, what it seems, are two totally different things. Some are going to Oblivion and some are going to the park. If it overlaps another meet-up, that bites, but at least this gives you variety for things to do this weekend. Most subreddits don't even have a meet up and you guys now have two of them to choose from (and more if you want to do it yourself). 

**EDIT #4** So here are the final details. We will be headed to Wekiwa Springs located in Apopka, please try to be there at 11am. I will be making signs to try and guide you guys where to go, but for the most part head for the picnic area near the Springs, NOT near Sand Lake. If you're going to be late, shoot me a PM, but as an fyi, I may be canoeing with some of the group. The picnic area should be around the Spring itself sooo, this accommodates us in two different ways: 1, we have a central location to essentially meet at and chit chat for a little bit, and two, for those of us who may not want to canoe and just want to relax at the park itself, you have the Spring near you if you want to take a dip in the water. 

I'm not sure how much this will help you guys, but here is a map for your viewing pleasure:
http://www.floridastateparks.org/lib/img/park/parkmap/wks-map.jpg

You can bring animals as long as they're leashed and not in the water, fyi. And no matter what we do, stay hydrated! It won't be blistering hot, but being busy and such, you'll get warm. Don't forget to bring yourself some noms! :) Any questions just PM me. I'll be updating this tomorrow morning if there is anything you guys will need to know. If you get lost, I will be reachable via PM. 

**edit** aaaaand were here. So come down. :)

**I will be editing this post throughout the course of today and tomorrow. Let me know your thoughts and concerns.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Downtown Orlando Residents and Merchants,

A group called Occupy Orlando has announced plans to peacefully assemble on Saturday, October 15th beginning at approximately 8:00 am in front of the Orlando Chamber of Commerce with plans to march through downtown, and ultimately occupy a downtown park or other public space.

The specific route for the march/walk appears at this time to be to the Orlando Chamber of commerce, then proceeding down Orange Avenue to the Bank of America building and finally ending at City Hall Plaza. Once there it is unknown how long the group intends to stay in the plaza.

While the City of Orlando is not associated with this event in any way, the Orlando Police Department will be present to ensure the safety of all protesters as well as those who live and work in downtown Orlando. The City of Orlando has communicated with the leaders of this loosely organized group in order to take steps to minimize traffic disruptions related to this event.

The Occupy Wall Street movement started in New York City and ""Occupy"" events like these have happened in dozens of cities across the country in recent weeks, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vast majority of these events have been conducted peacefully.

We support the right of Orlando's residents to protest and exercise free speech rights, and encourage all who participate to do so peacefully and with respect to the rights of others.

Sincerely,

Buddy Dyer
Mayor

We get points off if we miss even one spot of stain or deposit, so many patients have told me these cleanings are better than at their dentist's office. And yes! We do deep cleanings, and I have yet to see a case we couldn't handle. (The only thing we cannot do are restorations, which we would refer you to a dentist or dental school for.)

If you or anyone you know needs dental care, please feel free to contact me for further details, or to schedule an appointment. Also, if you know anyone with teenage children/nieces/nephews/cousins/etc., please let them know about us! We have requirements for a certain number of kids and teens, and are always hard pressed to find them.

Thanks so much for your past interest, r/Orlando, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the clinic!

* [Eden Bar at the Enzian](http://www.enzian.org/food/eden_bar/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=eden+bar&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.616066,-81.364242&amp;spn=0.020683,0.045619&amp;sll=28.608352,-81.410697&amp;sspn=0.020684,0.045619&amp;t=w&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=eden+bar&amp;z=15)) $$

 The Eden bar is actually attached to the Enzian theater, so after your meal (or even during--you can bring your food inside) you can always catch a neat cult/arthouse film. The food offerings are mostly American faire, but I want to give a special mention to their burgers. The eden burger is made from 100% locally-raised grassfed wagyu beef, aged cheddar, spiced mayo, and your standard burger veggie fixings. Order this rare (no need to worry about contamination issues since it's locally sourced, not factory processed)--the flavor and juicyness of this beef is simply unparalleled. The cocktail menu rotates regularly, but you can always have drinks made to order. I highly recommend the gin mojito--just remember to tip nicely since those things are a pain in the ass to make.

* [Thai Cuisine Restaurant](http://www.thaicuisineorlando.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=thai+cuisine+orlando&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.608352,-81.410697&amp;spn=0.020684,0.045619&amp;safe=off&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=thai+cuisine&amp;hnear=0x88e773d8fecdbc77:0xac3b2063ca5bf9e,Orlando,+FL&amp;cid=0,0,13709207733539008960&amp;t=w&amp;z=15)) $$

 Hands down *the* best Thai restaurant in Orlando. I've lived here for a long time (probably going on six years now) and have tried *many* different thai restaurants, and have been mostly underwhelmed until I found this place. It's not in the best neighborhood, but the food is 100% worth your time. The flavors are all spot on, the ingredients are all on (they use actual chinese broccoli, which seems to be a rarity around here), and the spice levels are actually meaningful (though they can somewhat vary by whoever's in the kitchen that day, ""thai hot"" is almost always *proper* hot). Their massaman and green curries are among the best I've tasted, and I've only had comparable pad thai at one other restaurant (if you ever find yourself in Miami, go check out Tani Thai in Pinecrest). Brilliantly prepared food combined with a surprisingly low price point make me a constant diner here.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_q1lun,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1lun/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/,

Thank you so much, everyone. I'm so happy that we were able to resolve this situation without any harm coming to the kitties. My uncle would probably haunt us forever if we allowed something bad to happen to his babies.  

~~So my uncle died a week ago, leaving behind two cats. I've been bugging my family about giving me photos and info about them, so I can try my best to rehome them. They finally just gave me photos, also telling me that I have just today to rehome them before they drop them off at a (kill) shelter.~~

~~Here are the photos they sent me:~~

~~[Sugar](http://i.imgur.com/w7TF2KE.jpg)~~

~~[Scratch](http://i.imgur.com/7TJMbBv.jpg)~~

~~**Edit**: I finally managed to get some information about them:~~

~~* They're both spayed females.~~

~~* They each received their vaccinations when they were spayed. They have not been vaccinated since then.~~

~~* The first cat, Sugar, is almost 4. The second cat, Scratch, is a little older, but her exact age is unknown. They believe she could be anywhere from 5-7.~~

~~* They are indoor cats, and they have never spent any time outside.~~

~~* They are both litter trained, and they don't claw the furniture.~~

~~I really don't want the cats to die, but I understand that the odds of me finding a new home for them in such a short amount of time are very slim. I'm not sure where else to turn besides here and craigslist, so if you have any information about no-kill shelters that actually have room for new cats at this time, please let me know!~~

~~If anyone is interested in adopting them, I'll do my best to bug my family for more information about them. I know that they're well-behaved kitties.

I'm so sorry about the confusion with the other post, there wasn't a conversation had and I'm sure we're just trying to accommodate both parties.  Underage redditors can attend, and you can PM me if you need my number or directions.**

**Edit Three: If I get enough requests for a meetup on Friday, I would LOVE to also have something smaller tomorrow night.  I don't want to exclude ANYONE.  Just please let me know what your thoughts are, and I'll be there, even if it's Oblivion for two nights in a row.** 

Hey dudes and ladydudes.  The last meetup a week and a half ago was a resounding success, even on short notice.  Everyone requested we plan something again quite soon.  So here I am, ready to take your suggestions.

HOWEVER! 

A few things: most of us are legally able to drink and really prefer bars with food.  Oblivion was the choice last time and it went very well.  The music was a bit loud for talking, so we might want to consider another location, having a house 'party' was another popular option, as drinking at a bar can be quite expensive.  Especially if people walk out on their tab.  No, we haven't forgotten, and you know who you are.

ALSO: I am more than willing to host smaller nights for the underage redditors at my apartment.  Or wherever.  Playing Cards Against Humanity was a suggestion a few of us made.

So here it is:  based off the number of posted votes I will be adding edits until we can all agree on a date, time, and place.

I think a Friday, around 7-8pm at Oblivion Tap Room in a week or two would be a good choice, and then the underagers can be there as well.

The roomie, a few friends, and I were leaving Tilted Kilt when one of the members of our group rushed off and sped out of the parking lot. Room mate and I joked as to why he was in such a hurry to leave, laughing as we got into our cars.

As we're pulling out onto Alafaya, how we could have possibly missed what he had seen is beyond me. There's smoke and pieces of car all over the street. Across the street there is a car smashed and flipped over, our friend parked behind him. 

For some reason, roomie is convinced friends of ours (who had left shortly before we did) are involved in the crash so we pull up near to them. She immediately jumps out of the car and rushes over to them, while I stick with the car 'cause I just have this image of an ambulance plowing past it if it's in the way. And it's like... what good would we have been? No good at all. The friend that had pulled up behind the crashed car is a former firefighter so I guess he has some knowledge of how to maybe comfort the guy and what not... Apparently half of his face is just... scraped off. Lots of blood on the sidewalk, and screaming. 

I've never encountered such an accident so closely before. I mean, you drive past these accidents all the time but I've never been there before the ambulance, feeling so helpless and stupid like ""What can I possibly do other than get the fuck out of the way?"" Finally managed to apprehend the room mate however and leave. So surreal. Really, really hope that kid is alright.

 This is one of two Mellow Mushroom locations in Orlando (the other being in Winter Park). They offer *uncannily* good and uniquely constructed pizzas. You can select base sauces ranging from red to pesto to garlic and olive oil, and toppings can be anything from steak to bacon to artichoke hearts and, of course, beyond. You'll be spending a little more cash here than at something like Dominoes, but you truly get what you pay for (the crust in particular is legendary). Eating in or out is an option, and if you dine in you can take advantage of their reasonable selection of beers on tap.

 Right on the intersection of University and Alafaya, its a great date place. While I have had better constructed sushi, I have not had better tasting sushi. Their curry is outstanding. (I can only fully vouch for the red curry, though.) They have an amazing happy hour special for their food (call them and ask for the time, it seems to be changing around as of late). My boyfriend and I can both go there and gorge for ~$40. They will always make sushi rolls special for you if you ask.

 They are located in Waterford on the side opposite from Best Buy, near the Buffalo Wild Wings I think.
I have gone there a few times and have not been disappointed with any of their items. Great quality, great portions, reasonable prices (not dirt cheap but it's worth the extra $ compared to something like Denny's). Fantastic omelettes. Their pancakes (with pecans ftw) are great and their waffles aren't bad either.

 Their Raspberry Stuffed French Toast Combo is to die for. They range from $/$$, depending on how much you order. They try to get you price-wise when adding things to combos, but they make up for it in overall healthiness and quality. They only use really good ingredients and most of the staff has a full understanding of what type of what is in you food. (Ie brand and type of cheese, or what kind of raspberry puree they use in the french toast that day, etc.) --[aleatoric](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1pbz/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_ucf/c3u6bg6)  &amp; [ThePhylli](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1pbz/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_ucf/c3u7qs8)

 This is one of three Bubbalou's Bodacious BBQ locations in Florida. Offering amazing southern style BBQ at a fair price. Bubbalou's also features an array of sauces to spice things up and offers true southern sweet tea to cool your taste buds. You will spend more here than you would at other BBQ joints such as Sonny's BBQ but for the price, their BBQ makes it well worth it. The atmosphere is very rustic with various older advertisements and memorabilia covering the walls. The Alafaya Trail location offers an attached sports bar which caters to football fans. Bubbalou's offers dine-in, take-out, and catering. --[slyphox](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1pbz/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_ucf/c3u86lp)",,False,,t5_2qh7s,True,,,True,t3_q1pbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1pbz/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_ucf/,

When you find a kitten, especially a VERY young one, leave it alone! Most times, mom is not very far! Of course, this depends on circumstance (dangerous place, sick, skinny, etc.) but if a healthy newborn kitten is in a bush, momma left it there for a reason.    
Momma cats can get pregnant DAYS after giving birth! That adds up to a lot of kittens over time. The best thing you can do for Orlando's kitten population is to spay and neuter your cats, ferals, and strays!    
    
[Spay the Strays, Inc.](http://spaythestrays.rescuegroups.org/info/display?PageID=2578) is a great place to call if you have a kitten or cat that needs a home or that needs help.    
[The Orange County website](http://www.orangecountyfl.net/AnimalsPets/FeralCats.aspx) has information about ferals and about the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program.

",30,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1adxoq/alright_orlando_who_wants_100_to_be_my_state/,"Greetings again, Orlando subreddit!  Many of you have availed yourselves of my dental cleaning prowess over the past few semesters, and overall I've gotten excellent responses.  Well, it's go time now.  I'm graduating and will be taking National and State Board exams for licensure as a Dental Hygienist.

The catch is that I need a patient for the exam.

So, basically, here's the deal:
I will give you $100, provide transportation, and pay for a hotel room.  You will ride to UF with me for a partial dental cleaning for my exam.  I will also pay to have your cleaning completed at Valencia when we get back ($20 value). 
You will get assessments and x-rays as well.

What I need is a patient with NO DECAY! (that is, no large, obvious cavities.  If you think you may have a small one somewhere, let me worry about that.  Or, if you have one isolated cavity on one part of your mouth, I may be able to work around that, too.)  Preferably, I would love to have someone whose wisdom teeth are not showing (So, two molars instead of three.)  Not too many missing teeth, either.

You should have had quite a while since your last cleaning, as I need a patient with fairly heavy calculus (tartar) buildup.  
If you think this sounds like you or someone you know, please drop me a line and I will give you details about coming to Valencia West Campus to be screened as a board patient.

Free trip to Gainesville plus $120 worth of compensation, just to get your teeth cleaned?  Nice.
If you have questions, feel free to ask, obviously.
Looking forward to finding a great board patient from this amazing community.

To those of you who have been my patients already, thank you so much.  You have been the most amazing people, and I've been so grateful to have you as my patients.

**EDIT for clarity and additional details:  

-The test is in May, and I will be screening this month and part of next month.

-It is best if you haven't been to a dentist in at least 2 years (for a cleaning), and don't floss... ever.  Not that I recommend that for a regimen, but for this purpose, it helps.

-I may ask you to send a picture of the back (tongue side) of your very front bottom teeth (the lingual surfaces of your anterior mandibular dentition, if you wanna get all technical).

Let me explain:

I have a 9 year old black mouth cur. He's a sweet dog. To adults. He's not great with other dogs (but gets along with some), and he's not good with small children. I don't have any other dogs but I do have a two year old. It's gotten to the point where I cannot risk my child's disfigurement or worse with keeping this 70lb bag of energized muscle in my house any longer. 

Bud doesn't have a mean bone in his body until a little person is around him. Before my son was born, he was rambunctious, sure, but since then there has been this growing sense of hostility toward my son. I simply can't risk it anymore. 

I spoke with my vet about it today in great detail and she agreed that, as sad and heartbreaking as it is, our dog is just not a safe fit in our home any longer.  He gets exercise. I've tried as much as I can stand and afford to keep my dog but I am at the point where he needs to go in one way or another, for the safety of my child. 

I can't send him to a shelter -- the odds of someone rescuing a 9 year old dog who does not do well with kids from a shelter is next to nothing.  I don't want him to sit in a cage for years.  I'm at the end of my rope. 

So, if someone is able to adopt a dog and doesn't plan on having kids any time in the next few years, please help.  

Before you respond with saying that it's a behavior and training issue, let me say that I have tried what has been suggested to me an that it has not bettered our situation. Any further training will take more time than I am willing to risk with a toddler around, and keeping them separated is not any better than Bud sitting in a kennel somewhere. 

This is a last ditch effort to find a home for this very sweet (to adults) dog before I feel that I need to put him down.  I'm very hesitant to put an ad on Craigslist because I'm concerned about dog fighting and him becoming a bait dog. I'd sooner have him euthanized. 

Help if you can. Thanks.

 Lam's Garden offers two menus: one is traditional and somewhat underwhelming americanized chinese fare, but the other one is the Serious Business Cantonese food (and, if you aren't of Asian descent and don't speak Cantonese, must usually be specifically requested). Here you can get everything from shark fin soup to jellyfish. Seafood is dominant, but there's quite a bit of excellent terrestrial fare as well. The Peking duck is excellent, and not at all a bad meal for three or four diners (ringing in at around $35). There's usually a complementary after-dinner course of taro tapioca soup and some orange; delicious! They also offer dim sum on the weekends but, while it's good, it's not as good as the nearby Ming's Bistro. *[DISCUSSION](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1joc/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_mills/c3u6m5z): there are some issues with health code violations at this restaurant. Caveat emptor.

 Ming Bistro is *the* place to go in orlando if you want some Serious Business dim sum. Prices are cheap, food is delicious, and nobody speaks English. You won't find a better venue for this sort of thing in Orlando and, as an added bonus, they have it every day of the week!

* [King Cajun Crawfish](http://www.kingcajuncrawfish.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=king+cajun+crawfish&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.556139,-81.352825&amp;spn=0.082777,0.182476&amp;safe=off&amp;hq=king+cajun+crawfish&amp;hnear=Orlando,+Florida+32804&amp;t=w&amp;z=13)) $

 My mom used to live in coastal Mississippi, and I would go visit in the summers. I have very fond memories of real-assed crawfish boils, proper gumbo, fried catfish, and plentiful (and cheap) po-boys. As a result, I've become something of a Cajun food snob. The fact that most cajun food you can find in Orlando *isn't* didn't help matters. Then, one day, I found King Cajun Crawfish (I was actually dining at funky monkey and the bartender was telling me how they wanted to buy the nextdoor property--KCC--to expand, amusingly enough). This place brings in actual factual live crawfish for their boils. They also have flash-frozen mudbugs but, honestly, it's only like a dollar less. Go with the live option. The seasonings are delightfully spicy, and are pretty bang-on with what I remember of those hot Mississippi summers. Everything on the menu is pretty compelling, save for the Jambalaya. Can't win 'em all I suppose, but the quality of what works more than makes up for that one misstep. Surprised at the authenticity of the place I spoke with the owners on one of my earlier visits; they're actually Vietnamese immigrants who moved to Mississippi, picked up on the culinary style, then brought it with them to Orlando. The food is spot on, and you won't find better (or cheaper) actual factual cajun food anywhere in town. Highly recommended.

 Pho 88 is one of the more celebrated Pho restaurants in Orlando, and for good reason. Portions are generous, the noodles are well done, and the seasoning is right. They also have a *fascinating* variety of smoothies, with everything from durian fruit to avocado options (the avocado smoothies are perplexing and delicious, by the way). 

* [Shin Jung](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/26/303337/restaurant/Colonial/Shin-Jung-Orlando) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=shin+jung+orlando&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.55394,-81.360703&amp;spn=0.04139,0.091238&amp;safe=off&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=shin+jung&amp;hnear=0x88e773d8fecdbc77:0xac3b2063ca5bf9e,Orlando,+FL&amp;cid=0,0,17955189670094838025&amp;t=w&amp;z=14)) $$

 This is basically your only option for Korean BBQ in Orlando (not that there aren't any better options, there just aren't any other options). Fortunately it's pretty good! The prices are a little steep, but the food is done right. Just be sure to get a table with a grill!

 Mein Gott im Himmel, Beefy King. The best place for roast beef sandwiches in Orlando. They've been routinely featured in the Sentinel's Foodie awards, as the winners of Best Sandwich. Freshly steamed when you order, their roast beef is accompanied by Beefy Spuds (tater tots deep-fried in the good stuff, the likes of which I've found nowhere else). You can get a sammich, beefy spuds, and a soda for $6. If you're not keen on roast beef, they also serve ham, pastrami, turkey, barbecue, and what I've heard is a fantastic Reuben (though I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut), among others.

 They're open for lunch Monday through Friday from 10-3 (with the drive-thru open 'til 5), and on Saturday from 11-3. --[korbaton](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1joc/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_mills/c3u1r79)

 Pretty great, relatively authentic mainland Chinese food. This is not New York style take out Chinese food, and some of the favors are off the wall.

 I got three tacos; the tofu curry (thought I didn't like tofu; I was wrong.), the fish one, and the chicken oriental one. All were amazing. (The fish one was my favourite though.) Its a very laid-back, hipster-esque place. A friend of mine took me there that works there, so I can't tell you how service is when you don't work there. They don't have any cheap beverages besides the free water, but they put cucumbers/lemons in the water so its really tasty and adds to the meal. Definitely a great place to fill up and not feel like you just gorged! --[ThePhylli](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1joc/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_mills/c3ua1pm)

 Me and one of my roommates love this place. Its a bit far for us, but totally worth the drive. They have great crab ragoons and pork satay. They also have the best Pad Thai I've had in town (though I haven't tried a lot of places yet). My boyfriend gets the basil duck every time. Every. Time. That's how good it is. Its a good place to try switching up what you want to try, because they are pretty good at nearly everything they do.

$, and wealthy people are not the problem, apathy is.

All protesting must be non-violent.  We need facts, with verifiable references, and a strong social media network to fight the real battles.

For those that wish to participate, here is the list of color codes for each service.  You are to wear a shirt, or tag with the color if you are going to be a volunteer.

Violet= transportation, helping protesters get from place to place.
Blue= protest leaders, making chants, slogans, and guiding protesters according to traffic laws.
Green= materials keepers (watch possessions, handles blankets, etc)
Yellow= legal team
Orange= updating team, handle gawkers, news updates
Red= first aid
Black= fact keepers, media orangizers, heckler control
White= peace keepers
Brown = food squad

There will be legal teams standing by to prevent, record, and defend against civil rights violations.

At this point a spanish speaker came up and delivered a speech in spanish.  My husband, a spanish speaker, said that the man gave a different message that was more about ending the Afghan war.  Very interesting.

The next speaker was a bombastic, crowd riling business man with a background in economics.  He didn't use an amplifier, preferring to shout angrily into the crowd.  His message:

The current economic crisis is due to intentional manipulation of the price of labor.  The American people were sold on the terms: ""globalization"" and ""free trade"".  

The migration of rural Chinese into cities resulted in a glutted labor market, where already poor people were willing to work for slave wages.  Western businesses moved into China, and other developing nations, in order to cut costs (buzzword ""outsourcing""). Money that corporations make has been repatriated and circulates around the world, avoiding income taxes.  So the jobs left the US, the money left the US, and nothing is coming back in but cheap imports that are barely taxed. 

The solution proposed is to balance cheap labor costs with higher taxes, forcing corporations to bring manufacturing jobs back into the US.  Japan and most other industrialized nations do this already.

The 1% pit American's against each other with topics like immigration (it's Mexico's fault!!1!1!), abortion, and religion.  Both political parties are compromised.  

The meeting closed with speakers from the crowd listing grievances, and one young man had a good point to make.  He said that we have plenty of grievances, but what is really needed are demands.  Balancing import taxes and labor cost, end corporate personhood, and terminate special interest group involvement with government.

I've only been in Orlando since August, so maybe this is a common occurrence and I'm just being ignorant, but it seems like there is a sudden influx of traffic patrol.

We went early last week, and now at least two of our 5 dogs have a parasite called flukes. It is not prevented or treated by traditional flea/tick/heartworm meds. This potentially deadly parasite attacks the liver, and must be treated early.

The parasite comes from snails. If your dog eats snails, or drinks water that has a large snail population, it is possible that they have it.

I am 90% certain that Fleet Peoples park is the culprit. Our remaining 3 dogs are being tested today. Good luck, and take care of your dogs, Orlando.

Update:

Only 1 of the 5 dogs have flukes. My pitbull has explosive diarrhea, but his fecal came back clean. The afflicted dog is on an oral paste medication for two weeks and should be fine.

1328720948.0,25,self.orlando,pgfyg,Do not use Damage Control Emergency Services and do not hire Contractor Andrew Napoli.,31,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/pgfyg/do_not_use_damage_control_emergency_services_and/,"We recently had a pipe break, flooding our house. After dealing with a plumber and our insurance company, we hired [Damage Control](http://www.damagecontrol911.com/) to help fix our house. The first crew they sent to our house was there to dry the floors, cabinets and walls out. They were nice, professional and did a good job. Then Damage Control sent us a contractor to do the work on replacing a damaged wall and our entire kitchen. The contractor that showed up was Andrew Napoli, and his crew which seemed to be his brothers and other family members. 

Andrew and his crew showed up and gave us a fair quote, to get the work done that we needed. They even agreed to finish patching some holes made when the plumber re-piped our house. Things seemed to be going good, then day 3 came and no one showed up at the time they said they would show up. We called them and Andrew said that another job came up and they would be there the next day. This same thing happened for the next 4 days. Then they finally showed up and did some more work, and then did not show again for another few days  even after saying they would be back the next day. When they finally came back Andrew said that the job took a little more money then they first quoted, I agreed that as long as it was just a little more then it was not a huge deal as long as the job got done right.

After another issue of them not showing up when they said they would, Andrew gave us the new price, it was more then double the quote they gave us before starting the job. I told him he was crazy, and that it was double the original quote, and that they haven't even done half the work they promised to do when they gave me the quote.   
After a long argument with Andrew on the phone about the crappy work that was done so far and the attempt to charge us double the quoted price for half the work, He then had the guts to tell me the job was being done under the table and to not tell anyone at Damage Control about it. I told Andrew that I did not want to see him or any of his crew near my house again.

I then called Damage Control and complained to them about Andrew, and told them about him saying the job was under the table and not to tell them about it. They said they would handle the situation and let me know how things turned out. I never heard from Damage Control again.

The next day I noticed the chainsaw I had in my garage was missing, the only people besides myself that were in the garage was Andrew  and his crew, so I can only assume that someone in Andrew's crew if not Andrew himself stole my chainsaw. It was not a very expensive chainsaw and I had no solid proof that they stole other then they were the only ones with access to the garage besides me and my family.

I later decided I was going to do some research on Andrew Napoli and Damage Control and post a site informing others of my experience, so they do not have a similar problem with Andrew or Damage Control. Turns out Andrew has been [arrested 3 times](http://florida.arrests.org/search.php?fname=Andrew&amp;lname=Napoli&amp;fpartial=True). I also found out through yelp.com that someone has had a [very similar experience](http://www.yelp.com/filtered_reviews/5lY-9mxzC6ZnzlPpAJs7vw?fsid=365byYTSzUZytOXWU4kiGUGpA) with Damage Control.

So I just want to get the word out that if anyone is in a similar situation and is looking for a company to help with some damage caused by a flood or fire Damage Control is probably not your best choice, and Andrew Napoli is definitely not a good choice if your are looking to hire a contractor. 

Damage Control has recently contacted me asking me to take down a Facebook page I made warning friends not to hire this company or Andrew. Damage Control stated in the letter that my issue was with Andrew and not Damage Control and I need to remove all mention of Damage Control from my page. 

Thing is I was under the impression I had hired a trusted employee of Damage Control to do the work on my house. It was not until things blew up that I was told that Andrew in fact was working under the table and that I apparently did not hire Damage Control, even though I was lead to believe I did. That and the fact that after complaining to Damage Control about Andrew, I never heard back from Damage Control at all. There was no attempt by Damage Control to make things right for them sending me a shady contractor and no contact from then to explain how something like this could have happened or what they did to resolve the issue with Andrew. For all I know Andrew and his crew still work for Damage Control and are still out there trying to take advantage of people.

I will update with photos of the crappy work Andrew and his crew did and a link to the archive of the site I had to take down as well as the letter from Damage Control asking me to take the site down.

**TL;DR** Informing people of a shady company and contractor that they shouldn't do business with.

Do you wish to use your OOP powers for good? Are you a pretty cool guy/girl who doesn't afraid of anything?

If you answered 'Yes' to all of the above, then you seem like the kind of programming intern we're looking for. We've posted on Reddit a few times in the past, and it's always turned out great. 

**The Basics**

We need someone who is willing to work a set schedule of 10 to 20 hours a week in Winter Park. We understand that people have other obligations, so we are able to work around school schedules. 

The initial position is for 90 days for $10/hr. If those 90 days go well, there is definitely room for the intern to come on full-time (we have had this happen a few times already, myself included). 

The majority of the work will be done in Python. If you've never used Python before, we won't count that against you at all. We are looking to hire as soon as possible.

**Experience**

Since this *is* an internship, we are willing to spend a good portion of the time teaching and working with the intern. That said, we do require a decent grasp of object oriented concepts. You need to know what classes are, how inheritance works, etc. That is really the only technical requirement for the position. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The Project**

We work for a non-profit that helps people with disabilities locally. The Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the company use. The software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems. We pride ourselves on being able to adapt the software to the developing needs of these branches in the day-to-day.

**Applying** 

Send resumes and questions to mcalvo@cilorlando.org. Please make sure your resume is no longer than one page. Do not try to contact via Reddit PM.

----

Basically, any time the Orlando Magic scores over 110 points in a game (and wins), Papa Johns will do the deal the next day where they take 50% off of the total of your order. For the past few weeks, the Magic have been playing extremely well and have scored over 110 in five of the last eight games. So that means 5 times in the last two weeks have been 50% for those who are in the know.

So I know not everyone is in to basketball or the Magic and I want to make sure my fellow Orlando'rs are getting a good deal when they can! I suggest you take advantage of this soon, we don't know if the Magic can keep this up (or if Papa Johns is gonna keep the special going; I imagine this is losing them money).

So if you want the deal, just order online and use coupon code MAGICWIN and it will take 50% off. 

They have some decent specials you can use it with to get a great deal overall. I have been getting the 'Any Large for 10$ (including specialties)' deals times 2, then using the coupon so its like 2 large specialties for 10$. That is a serious deal for papa johns.

----

Also so I don't spam /r/Orlando with this every time the deal happens, I will come back to this post if I happen to see the Magic score over 110 in the coming weeks so that you can check and see if there is a deal on the night you want pizza.

It will be held on March 30th, 9:00AM at the Lake Nona YMCA.

Just a little info about it. It is a 5K...WITH A TWIST! At the halfway point of the course, you will have the option to try and eat delicious DONUTS. How many you ask? You get to choose when you sign up from 5 different divisions: CASUAL (0), TURKEY BACON (1), PIGLET (3), PIG (6) or the ever impossible and hilarious HOG (12).

This is just a FUN run! We encourage anyone to come out, from the elite runners to walkers. We have a DJ, face painters, an MC that will be roasting the people as they attempt to eat their donuts, and a FREE ""Lil' Oinker Fun Run"" for the kids and they get munchkins as a reward for finishing. We also have some ridiculous raffle items for you to win! 

Each person that registers gets 1 free raffle ticket, the donuts, and a sweet dri-fit shirt.

My wife and I came up with the idea for this race 2 years ago. The first year we had 60 people, last year we had 280, and this year we are expecting close to 400...hopefully more with your help!!

Every dollar that we raise goes to a charity called ""Hailey's Hopes and Hugs"" which is a foundation that helps local families that have children with cancer cover their medical costs. 

We would love it if you joined us for a day of fun. There will be an after-party later that day at the brand new ""Nona Blue"" restaurant that is opening in a couple of weeks in Lake Nona.

As a thank you for being a fellow Redditor, when you sign up for the race it will ask you who referred you. Put in Reddit and I will give you 5 raffle tickets instead of 1. Go to the website and you will see some of the prizes you can win!

Price increases next Friday! It's only $25 right now.

Thank you all for your support! We are the #1 ""most popular"" running event in Orlando on Active.com right now!

Here's my story.,29,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/zpopv/i_hired_the_ticket_clinic_to_fight_a_recent/,"I was stopped going south on Maguire at the Colonial intersection. I was going to make a right, but there's no right on red. So, I am sitting at the light, watching the traffic. I see traffic turning left off of Colonial onto Maguire. I see the right turn arrow turn yellow (I think, crap I missed the green), and quickly go while the arrow is still yellow. I mostly felt bad for the people behind me, thinking I was holding them up because I missed the right on red green arrow.

I look in my rearview mirror, and see a cop shoot out. He gets right on my ass, puts on his lights, and I pull over. He asks me if I know why he pulled me over. I told him ""no"". He said the right turn from Maguire has no turn on red, that whole intersection is like that. I said, yes officer, I know that, but the light was still yellow. He said **if the light was still yellow, I wouldn't be able to pull you over now would I?** (note, I pulled a Costanza and days later thought, *well, if the light was red, I wouldn't have been able to go now would I*).

I stopped the next morning on my way to work and wanted to get a video to show that when the traffic is coming left off of Colonial and onto Maguire, the signal turns green to allow you to turn right. Well, while recording, the traffic coming off of Colonial starts to turn left, but the green arrow to turn right never comes on. I thought I was screwed, and that it really was my fault. Then, the yellow arrow came on, so I knew that the green arrow was out. I figured the cop probably just missed the yellow arrow and assumed I ran the red.

I explained all this to the Ticket Clinic attorney. He told me my video of the faulty light doesn't matter at all. Unless I had video of the incident, they would ignore it, stating that anything can happen in 24hrs.

The cop ended up not showing up to court, so the ticket was dropped.

While the Ticket Clinic didn't really do much, it was nice having the expertise and peace of mind having them there for $90.

My goal here is to create a comprehensive and detailed list that can be linked to (from the sidebar, even) as a standard response. Because reddit has a 10k character limit for a single post, I will be splitting this up by neighborhood.

If you're all into this idea, please respond with your recommendations below; I'll edit this post to include contributions from others. Please include: 

* a link to the restaurant's website, if one is available. If not, I would suggest linking to an appropriate review aggregator like UrbanSpoon.

* a link to a google map with the restaurant's location. If it's a food truck, link to their twitter feed.

* a brief review of the restaurant and what makes it notable

* a quick price estimate for a full meal, including at least one appropriate drink ($ = &lt; 10$/person, $$ is up to 20$/person, $$$ up to 50$/person, $$$$ &gt; 50$/person)

I think we should try to avoid larger chains since the goal here is to showcase what Orlando has to offer, but we can make some exceptions if we get significant consensus or if the chain is primarily local (for example, I think Ceviche, Mellow Mushroom, and probably Tijuana Flats deserve a spot on the list, but I would be hesitant to include something like Melting Pot). If somebody posts a recommendation for a restaurant but there's significant controversy/dissenting opinion, I'll add a note in the review and permalink to the discussion thread. Feel free to use personal opinion in the reviews--it should be clear that this is all local opinion, and not objective scientific FOOD FACT. I'll include a link to the user who submits the review at the end of each entry.

What I've got here isn't intended to be comprehensive, but I wanted it to serve as a launching point for further input. Let's review some restaurants!

I've messaged the mods and if this idea takes off, the posts will be linked to in the sidebars. Once these posts have been up for a while, I will remove this preamble from all of them.

**DOWNTOWN**

* [The Rusty Spoon](http://www.therustyspoon.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55+west+church+street+orlando&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.53967,-81.38122&amp;spn=0.041395,0.091238&amp;hnear=55+W+Church+St,+Orlando,+Florida+32801&amp;gl=us&amp;view=map&amp;t=w&amp;z=14)) $$$

 The Rusty Spoon is Orlando's downtown gastropub offering, situated on the ground floor of the 55 West building in Church Street Station. Almost all (if not all) of the food is locally sourced, and the menu rotates accordingly. Being a gastropub the food is traditionally inspired with modern stylings, and has, in my experience, always been spot on. The mixed drinks are good, but not the most impressive I've had (Eden Bar and Ravenous Pig probably tie in that category). With every meal you'll recieve a complementary ""shot"" from the chef--something tasty, refreshing, and pureed (non-alcoholic). This changes every day, and is always a nice way to start the meal.

* [Ceviche Tapas Bar and Restaurant](http://www.ceviche.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=ceviche+tapas+bar+and+restaurant,+orlando+fl&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.540518,-81.384316&amp;spn=0.041395,0.091238&amp;sll=28.543138,-81.38122&amp;sspn=0.041394,0.091238&amp;t=w&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=ceviche+tapas+bar+and+restaurant,&amp;hnear=Orlando,+Orange,+Florida&amp;z=14)) $$/$$$

 Ceviche is one of the better tapas bars in town, conveniently situated in the middle of Church Street Station. Ceviche offers an incredibly wide variety of tapas, from the namesake ceviches to braized oxtail to even several vegetarian offerings. Expect to order 3-4 plates per person, and be sure to share with your group! Wait times for tables can be a bit long if you don't call in a reservation on the weekends, but bar seating is usually quickly available.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_q1ii3,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1ii3/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/,

Aren't there special services for women/children?,26,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1cuj24/homeless_woman_and_her_little_girl_sleeping/,"I work downtown and usually can't walk two blocks without being hit up for cash by homeless people and grifters.  I'm used to seeing homeless people sleep outside my building, and am starting to recognize some of ""the regulars"".

Tonight there was a young woman and her little girl curled up in the entry way to my building trying to stay out of the rain.  The girl was asleep with her head on her mother's lap.  This is unusual because a) I never see homeless women downtown, b) especially not with kids, and c) they both looked pretty clean and well kept.  I'm used to seeing homeless men downtown, but these two caught me off guard.  The little girl was 5-7 years old, cute and blonde, and completely out cold on her mother's lap.   Got me right in the feels.

Anyways the mother had a pretty pissed off look on her face as I walked by, so I turned my head and minded my own business.  I came back out 30-40m later, on my way to a property we use up the street.  I tried to open the door quietly to avoid waking the girl.  The mother asked me if I wanted them to move.  I told her ""no"", they should be fine there and offered to bring them some fruit and water from work.  (We keep some in a cafe-type deal at the other site)  She accepted and I did.  She asked me if I'd brought it from a 7-eleven, and I said ""no"".  She asked me where one was and I told her.

Now my father was a cop and I make a point not to give money to homeless people.  Food, water, etc. fine.  But the truth is most of the people pan-handling out there don't want these things.  Ever eat lunch downtown?  See all those people asking for money?  Try carrying a banana and an orange around with you.  They will leave you the fuck alone.

So other than food, which I've already given them, I'm curious what services are out there and if I can help them find some shelter.  Couple questions:

*  Are there women's or children's shelters I can refer them to?
*  Any services downtown that can help?
*  Assuming this is a new circumstance for them, what all could/should they be doing to get back on their feet?",,False,,t5_2qh7s,False,,,True,t3_1cuj24,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1cuj24/homeless_woman_and_her_little_girl_sleeping/,

I've been in Orlando for 6 years, and have heard about 4Rivers since. ""The best BBQ you will ever eat""  ""The best pulled pork on earth"" ""the best in central florida"" etc......

No. Not even close. But that's my opinion I'm sure most of you will disagree. But maybe I got the wrong thing?
I walked up to the ordering station with my girlfriend and asked the person there: ""What can I get that is a sampler of the best things you do?"" He said get the sliders they have pulled pork, brisket and burnt ends. All the reviews said this was the best items they did, along with ribs but we weren't in the mood for ribs. So we ordered that. and here's what we got: http://imgur.com/PXaF9tx. 
I don't care much about looks, it's BBQ in the end. Plus I think this looks pretty damn good. But the taste.... All three of the meats were cold. not room temperature, but Cold. 

The pulled pork (extreme left) was borderline tasteless with a faint taste of sweet vinegar. The Brisket (middle) tasted 100% like cheap beef jerky with almost the same consistency and dryness. The burnt ends (extreme right) were burnt ends. You either like them or you don't, out of the three I didn't mind this one as much as the others, but still that taste of tangy vinegar was there. I know some people use vinegar to marinate or to base as it smokes and cooks. But it's never been this present. And now for the famous BBQ sauce they offer. The ingredients were probably Vinegar, Brown Sugar, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Brown Sugar and Vinegar. You get the point. 
Damn good macaroni and cheese though! Amazing coleslaw, perfect sweetness and bite, Baked bbq beans were sweet and flavorful. 

 Overall, in my opinion, it was below average. Was it my expectations? Did I order the wrong thing? Should I give it another shot at another location?(I went to the one on West 50).

**COLLEGE PARK**

 Adriatico is a very nice mid-range italian restaurant in the heart of College Park. The offerings are mostly traditional Italian fair, and are consistently executed perfectly. The chef (an Italian expat) and his wife run the restaurant, and are quite engaging with the diners. Wine portions are also pleasingly substantial.

* [Jade Bistro](http://www.jadebistro.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=jade+bistro&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.573583,-81.389178&amp;spn=0.010345,0.02281&amp;sll=28.573734,-81.389328&amp;sspn=0.010345,0.02281&amp;t=w&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=jade+bistro&amp;z=16)) $$

 Jade Bistro has an excellent atmosphere, and feels/looks much more expensive than it actually is. They offer incredibly well-executed Americanized Chinese fare as well as some quality (albeit non-traditional) sushi. There's usually a sushi of the day offered--a roll that the chef dreams up--though it can sometimes miss the mark.

 On the border of what you may consider College Park you will find a little plaza with the Mediterranean Deli. The first time you walk in to this place the owner, Walid will make you feel like you go there every day. Extremely nice and helpful he is always there. Grab a cheap Gyro that is easily the best in the area. He loads it up. I watched him make a hummus platter for a customer that was the size of my coffee table and ended up charging $5. It’s a little hole in the wall with limited seating but clean and plenty big enough to sit and enjoy a bite or simply get it to go! Grape leaves, hummus, tabbouli, falafel…all the norm for a place like this but it’s Walid that will keep you coming back. --[deadparts](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1j4o/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/c3u68yf)

 My favorite pizza in College Park. A great place for a family dinner to shove the kids faces with cheese and dough or to keep an eye on the game while having a nice meal with the lady. Subs, salads, pasta, pizza it’s all pretty good. You might as well get a few garlic knots as they are cheap, fresh and dripping in garlicky goodness…and what goes better with pizza that more bread. I’ve had some iffy experiences with their pasta dishes but overall it is great place with solid service. The bar next door (the Local) has the same owners and I believe are the same people who owned the previous pizza place, Alfonzo’s. If you liked Alfonzo’s you’ll like Ragazzi’s. --[deadparts](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1j4o/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/c3u6dqw)

I'm an engineer living in downtown Orlando, and have little experience/knowledge with politics, local or otherwise. I was wondering if anyone could provide some advice on how to petition the city to change a locally enforced law/regulation. 

It might sound a little frivolous, but the reason I want to learn more about this is that I recently learned that it's illegal to skateboard (and by general similarity, longboard as well) in Orlando. Apparently in the 1980's a bunch of kids vandalized businesses and city property, I assume by doing tricks (grinding rails, etc.) and probably generally just being assholes to local establishments and police. In a desperate bid to put an end to it, it looks like instead of enforcing existing vandalism laws, the city just banned the boards instead. 

The ban from the 1980's probably made the work of police a lot easier by being able to pick out the kids without much effort, but this unfortunately also crushed a pretty efficient and otherwise legitimate form of personal transportation. Today, I see people (usually on longboards) skating around Orlando on a nice day, but I unfortunately also hear stories of police warnings, actual tickets, and sometimes even reports of impounded boards. Commuting with a longboard is great because you can easily pick it up and take it with you. Once Sunrail opens, the effectiveness of something like a longboard really begins to shine as you can quickly cover that ""last mile"" to and from the station, but also be able to easily take the board on and off the train (compared to something like a bike). 

I can understand the motivations for the original 1980's ban, but in 2013 this has to end. There has to be a way to allow longboarders and skateboarders to simply get from point A to point B while also preventing damage to property. Times have changed, and longboards have improved with ""commuter"" designs that are every bit as effective (and much more fun) as a bike for getting around. There are even boards in the works that are self-propelled via electric motors that will be hitting the market soon, designed to be an even more effective form of ""last mile"" transportation: (TED talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19OlWvdUSg). Commuters on longboards will only become a more common sight in cities in the future, and I'd like to do my part to help make sure that Orlando will be one of them. 

Any advice/thoughts anyone can offer?

Basically, she was a breeding dog, I suspect she was abused, and she bit a child after it started roughhousing with her puppies. I don't blame her.
So her owners (supposedly the breeders/abusers) took her to the vet to be put down.

My friend who is a vet tech guilt tripped me into ""rescuing"" her.
I'm a college student. My mom works full time, as do I. It's not like we took on a dog thinking we could, we got this dog forced onto us with ""if you don't take her she's going to DIE and anything you can give her is better than that"". Which is true, and we have.

But we don't want this dog. She's great with adults (haven't seen her around kids but she's sweet enough to assume she won't bite one again without major provocation) but BAD with other dogs.

She plays fetch really well and it's pretty much what she lives for. It's cute how she hops like a bunny when you have a ball in your hand.

Anyway, last night she bit my cat. My cat will be okay, but the dog has to go. I want you guys to take her, if you can. You can't have any other animals because she gets jealous/aggressive/territorial. I think she's about 5 or 6. 

Good for people, very bad for dogs/cats.

Someone take her. I don't want to have to take her to the SPCA but after biting my cat I don't know anyone who will take her.
Message me if you're interested. I can see about getting you a kennel and bag of dog food as well.

I feel terrible, but honestly it was pushed onto me and I am not ready or able to have an animal.

Work for $9.00/hour (to start), programming in Python (don't worry if you've never heard of Python). No degree or professional experience required. Applicants will join a team of two other experienced Python developers. Must be able to work a consistent 10-20 hours a week schedule. The actual schedule is fairly flexible, and will be worked out between the applicant and supervisor. We can work around your school schedule. The internship lasts for 90 days, with a strong possibility of being hired on afterwards.

**Experience**: You will need to have a strong grasp of object oriented programming. You should know at least one OO language. We can teach you Python, but you need that OO foundation. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JQuery, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The project**: Work for a non-profit who helps people with disabilities locally. Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the non-profit use. Our software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems.

**Other thoughts**: The applicants need to be sensitive to people with disabilities, as he/she will often interact with people of varying degrees of disability. The most important qualities in applicants will be enthusiasm about programming. You don't need professional experience or a portfolio.

**What is Arduino?**  It's an open-sourced hardware microcontroller platform that allows you to make or automate pretty much anything you can think of.  For some examples, see here:
http://hacknmod.com/hack/top-40-arduino-projects-of-the-web/

**What is FamiLAB?**  Central Florida’s provider of space, tools, and community for creative technical learning and projects. FamiLAB welcomes makers, artists, thinkers, hackers, crafters, and everyone else – come wield your imagination in any (legal and ethical) way you see fit.  For more info, see here:  http://familab.org/blog/about/

In this ""all ages"" beginner’s class, you will learn the basics of the Arduino hardware, and how to install and use the Arduino software. You will build simple circuits that can be controlled with the Arduino and explore “shields” that are available to expand the Arduino. Bring your own Arduino and components, or pre-order an Arduino Starter Kit which includes an Arduino Uno, a USB cable, a solderless breadboard, jumper wires, and an assortment of switches, potentiometers, LEDs and resistors.

**Saturday, October 15th, 10:00AM - 12:00 PM**

**Members of FamiLAB - FREE** (does not include hardware)
**Non-Members - $20** (does not include hardware) 
**Optional Arduino Starter Kit - $45** (from adafruit industries)

I have, however, had lots of experience ""hunkering down"" *just in case*, so here's what I have for you.  This is assuming you're going to lose power/water for a while.  Please feel free to add to the list!

**Things to have on hand:**

- WATER

- flashlights/batteries

- battery operated radio

- candles/lighters

- canned foods (I prefer Chef Boyardee and canned veggies)

- peanut butter and jelly/crackers (protein and fruit [kinda])

- nuts/raisins/trail mix

- comfort food (chips, snack bars, something you actually ""like"" but still, non perishable)

- first aid kit

- tarp

- battery operated fans

- batteries, batteries, batteries :)

**If you have a grill and plan on using it:**

- you can warm up canned foods and things like that, but I wouldn't recommend buying anything you *have* to warm up, because that grill could be gone if the hurricane is bad enough.

- propane/charcoal/lighter fluid

- paper plates/utensils

- consider putting your grill in the garage, if you have one, but don't put it inside your house

**Make sure you:**

- have a car with a tank full of gas

- pre-charge your phone, computer, etc.

- have a car charger for those things, if it's important you be able to use them

- have cash handy in case you can't get to an ATM and need money

- allow any friends/family members to stay with you if you have a sturdy home and they are in danger, ie. live in a mobile home

- retreat to the bathroom if the hurricane gets really bad- hold on to the pipes if need be

- STAY AWAY from windows

- if you're lucky enough to have a generator, DON'T OPERATE IT INSIDE YOUR HOME.  You have no idea how many people die when the power goes out from this.  Darwin Award nominations, all of them.

- mattresses make good barriers for hallways

- remove everything from your front and back porch/lawn that could become a projectile in high winds

- fill your bathtubs with water (for washing up)

**To avoid from going crazy out of boredom in the aftermath:**

- have a good book handy to read

- if you live with people, board games/cards/booze, etc. are good to take your mind off the unbearable heat

- if you live with a girlfriend/boyfriend/SO, please use protection!  sex is a great way to pass the time, but birth rates normally spike 9 months after severe hurricanes.

I have plenty [x-post /r/UCF],27,9,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/id8px/anybody_want_google_invites_i_have_plenty_xpost/,"Figured I would give out invites to my local community that way we all have a better chance at getting to know each other for future meet ups instead of a bunch of people spread across the US.

How to get an invite:

1. PM me your email, don't post it in the main topic so we don't have anyone get compromised.
2. Post in the topic you PM'd me
3. I will send the invite, once you receive the email, click on ""Learn More""
4. I will reply to the post in the thread that way others will know you have an account as well in case I run out of invites.

Rules:

1. If I invite you please invite others on reddit so we can get everyone in the UCF/Orland reddit an invite that wants one

**Please Read This Edit**

EDIT 3:

Found another workaround, check the invite I sent to you but check it on your mobile phone, then select ""View Comment"" it should allow you to join.

EDIT 2:

It appears as of 1050 30JUN11 either Google has patched the invite loophole, or I may have just run out of G+ invites, if the latter is the case and you **DID NOT** get a working invite and cannot access G+ please PM me and I will try to find someone who can invite you in case I just ran out. If it was patched I will invite you as soon as Google re-opens the invite system legitly.

EDIT: 

1. I am currently sending invites using a loophole as Google disabled invites last night, I do not know when this loophole will be patched so if you did not receive one I am very sorry, but as of 1024 30JUN11 I still can.

2. The invite system does not automatically add me to your friends list or anyone else here, once you join you will not have any listed friends unless someone in your contacts has Google+, if you want me or anyone as a friend here PM them or myself respectively.

I seem to be a bit of a closet reddit user as I spend the majority of my day being a lazy procrastinator reading posts and never posting instead of doing any real work haha. 

Anyways I am a graphic designer that lives downtown Orlando (moved to the area about a year ago) and am looking for some cool people to hangout with. I am a guy in my early 20s and live with my girlfriend. Just curious if anyone here on reddit have similar interests?! 

My interests:
Sports (NBA and NFL mostly)
Gaming
Design
Craft beers
Huge stand up comedy nerd ( Atell , CK, Carlin, Cross, Stanhope, Rogan, Pryor etc)
NORML

It might be me but I found the feel of downtown depressing. The streets felt pretty empty and there seemd to be either crazy and homless people everywhere. For example I saw three seperate people talking to themselves, one guy dropped and started doing pushups on the sidewalk while we were eating. And there were large groups of homeless people hanging outside the library.

Don't get me wrong, I actually think there should be lots more money spent on helping the homeless and mentally unwell. However a city center should feel alot friendlier, perhaps it was just the lack of normal activity, perhaps I am just older and more aware of how vaunerable I am, but I didn't feel comfortable walking around downtown and just wanted to leave.

Anyway, maybe I have spent to long sheltered in Suburbia, maybe i'm just over sensitive, maybe Downtown Orlando is going through a transforamtion. Anybody want to weigh in?

So, today I went to the Publix by Lake Eola on Central Blvd. I drive a RV so I have to park on the street. As I'm getting out of my RV, this big, middle aged, Latino guy comes over telling me that I might get ticketed because I'm too far into the other space and helps me correct it.

I get to talking to him and find out his name is Noel. He's homeless. But he works part time doing housing work for a real estate guy who lets him rent a room above his garage right on Lake Ave. He also helps park cars across the street.

He had one felony record on him from 15 years ago when he apparently got in a fight over his daughter. He's a certified chef but lost his job when they ran a background check. No one will hire him because of this one bad mark. He's also capable of doing handy work and apparently fixing cars. His mother passed away recently and left the house to him and his sister. But his sister keeps the house and won't talk to him because he testified against her ex-husband as being violent.

Oh yeah, since he basically lives on Lake Ave so he watches out for expired parking meters and puts quarters in when he can. 

All in all, he's a really spirited, happy, and good guy. He's a hustler (in the good sense of the word) down on his luck but I'm hoping he does well. 

I told him I was going grocery shopping. When I came out, he offered to help carry my bags. I kept waiting for his ""play"", to try and sucker money from me. But he NEVER once asked me for anything except to use my phone to call about a job. He did suggest that he could help me wash my RV and re-caulk the seams which are noticeably bad but wasn't pushy about it at all, and I could actually use the help. I brought him a $10 Publix Gift card and only gave it to him as I was leaving. He's clearly not a drug addict or anything.

So, if you see this guy on Lake Ave, don't worry, he's cheerful and just trying to get out of a rut.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,True,,,True,t3_kxqmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/kxqmj/lake_eolas_homeless_saint_against_parking_tickets/,

(Graffiti Junktion-Hambuger Mary's-Pine 22-Five Guys) If you haven't had any of the above you are committing a heinous crime, like my girlfriend.(I took her to graffiti junktion previously)

 So in order to educate her, I ran and ordered a Barbara-Q Bacon Cheeseburger from Hamburger Mary's and ran back and got The Burginator from Pine 22(without the fried egg on top because damn guys, damn.) And I thought I'll jot down my opinion on both burgers and their components and the fries for both places and share it here.

Here are the burgers(sorry no side view we were starving): http://imgur.com/AYKlE5m

 Left: Hamburger Mary's-----Right: Pine 22.

Allow me to start with a cliché statement: Both were absolutely amazing. I mean Amazing. 

Starting with Hamburger Mary's, My girlfriend's favorite out of the two: The bun was a regular sesame bun, not toasted,the beef patty oh so excellent and succulent and juicy with the right amount of Jack/Cheddar covering it. To top it off was a perfectly cooked onion ring and some BBQ sauce. The burger was amazing, but the fries were damn perfect. Each fry was a perfectly seasoned crispy shell filled with silky mashed potatoes. Not one fry was flaccid, soggy or stale. 

On to Pine Twenty 2, my favorite burger of the two. Perfect bun, buttered and toasted. The grass-fed half pound beef patty in my opinion tasted much ""beefier"" than Mary's, which is why I liked it better. The char on the burger gave the patty an amazing kick and the juice rendering from it didn't do any harm either. The cooked onions and the melted gruyère cheese lifted the burger to another level of perfection. The matchstick or allumette fries on the other hand... were ok. I don't mind thin cut fries, but I do mind soggy limp flaccid fries, and unfortunately the fries were exactly that at pine twenty 2.

So here was my little adventure in downtown orlando today, where we went and checked out the food and wine festival later on. I suggest you try what I did!

Ive read a few threads on here and are hoping to clarify a few things. Ill be staying the last week of January.

I got a really good rate at the Parc Soleil so we will be staying there for the whole trip. It seems to be pretty much 15-20 minutes from the places we would like to go (disney, universal, Mall at Millenia &amp; the premium outlets). The hotel said there are $9 shuttle services to the theme parks per person and its rougly a $20 dollar cab ride to the Mall and Outlets. Would be the best way to go about transport?

Is there anything that I should really be aware of. From what I can tell the weather seems to be similar to Sydney some days hot sometimes cold and rainy. Would it be reasonable to assume ill be able to get some pool time or is it still mostly miserable around the end of January?

Also in regards to the theme park tickets. Is the best place just to book on the website?

Thanks alot if I think of anymore ill edit this post :)

Edit: Looks like I'm getting some slightly discounted tix through the expedia stand at my hotel just called them up. Stupid text file didn't save but from memory it was $240 for 2 people, 2 days islands of adventure and universal studios plus a water park for free. Disney i don't remember exactly but it was about 20-40 dollars cheaper so im guessing thats the best way to go.

In case you want to geek out and see the best versions you'll have two options.  AMC Altamonte Mall to see it in IMAX 3D w/HFR or AMC Downtown Disney to see it in Dolby Atmos w/HFR. All this means is do you wana see it with a bigger screen or better sound.

The moment I stepped outside MCO, I knew this was the place I wanted to eventually move to. Beautiful palm trees, sunny skies, lizards everywhere, friendly brown squirrels, amazing attractions, etc... The list is too large.


Now I didn't get to visit much outside of the general USRO area, and I reserve complete judgement until I re-visit in a couple of months. However, I just wanted to share my thoughts and let those who may work for one of the places we've visited the following: Thank you for a wonderful time. Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios and Seaworld were phenomenal experiences. We liked the atmosphere so much, that we just walked to CityWalk when our shuttles weren't operating.

We are organizing a holiday dinner at Cattleman's Steakhouse on International Drive for 500 homeless students and their families on December 21st. 
We are working with local schools and the Stewart B. McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Coordinators at each school to identify and invite families in need.

Reddit! I need your with this event. We already have the food and venue for this event but we still need help reaching some of our goals. We really want to send some of the families home with some gift cards to Publix or other goodie bags. So if you have a little extra, you can donate it [here](https://www.undly.com/sworlandocommunitydinner). 
Every bit helps and 100% of it is going to the families that are invited.

Also, we are setting up for some live music and entertainment for the event but we do not have a band yet. So if you have a band or know of a band that would be willing to donate their time, please let us know!

Here is the [facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/116293685153589/) for you guys to check out. 
If anything please just help us spread the word about our event. And if  you have any comments of advice to help us out that would be great as well.

I want to turn this into an epic tasting so i'm hoping to find some other beer geeks. This will be happening on May 3rd 6:00PM at the world of beer on university blvd. 

Here's the line up i'm brining to the tasting so far. All of these bottles are in addition to the 250$ bar tab. 

Brooklyn-2010 Black Ops 
Cigar City-Hunaphu 11 
Cigar City-Caspricho Obscura #4 
Cigar City- 110K+OT
DogFish- Bitches Brew 
DogFish-2007 Raison D'extra 
Founders-3 Year Vertical KBS 09-11 also 2010 regular BS 
Founders- 2009 Nemesis 
Lost Abbey-Angels Share

If you are interested in coming I'm asking everyone to bring at least one harder to find bottle that is not already on the list. 

Edit: 110k+OT is cigar city not dogfish. If everyone posts what they are brining I will update the list as this grows. 

Edit 2: Cigar City/Bruery colab Marron Acidifie- very nice addition to the list!

Edit 3: Not to be a dick about it, but some of these bottles and the ones people are brining are very rare, it would be rude of me to share them with everyone. We will separate the beers into two categories based on availability and price and have two different tasting groups based on the quality of the beer you bring. 

Edit 4: A couple bottles of award winning home brewed mead have been added to the list. Pumped about that.

She is fiercely ""organic"" i.e. worthless and refuses to use anything ""unnatural"" i.e effective. She has instead decided that a more effective means of flea control is to throw two loving cats out into the woods to make friends with the coyotes. One of these cats has been with the family his whole life and is now very old and has a terrible limp. The other was a bandaid she and her baby-daddy tried to ""adopt"" while they learned how to prepare for their baby. Unsurprisingly, that relationship fell apart. She refuses to get a job to pay for vet bills and instead mooches off the her parents, of whom the father works excessive hours to pay for all this and the mother is also a giant turd. 

PLEASE HELP ME. I have a strict two pet policy that is monitored and I already have two dogs. I need help rehoming these cats.

**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

**Money:** It's about 500 dollars a month which includes water and trash. Electricity is usually about 130 but we could definitely get it lower. There would be no move in fee and the security deposit is already covered.


**Furry Friends**
I have one cat but we're keeping her under the radar because of pet rent. IT's like 100 dolllars down and then 10 dollars on the rent each month. If you have a cat or small dog you'd like to bring they are more welcome but then I think we should tell the apartment and start paying pet rent :)


**Personal Things**
I am a pretty laid back person. The person moving in would have to be 420 friendly. The only place in the apartment I really care that is clean is the kitchen because of roaches. I am an art and psychology major with interests in history and astronomy, so anyone with those common interests would be awesome. I'm always up for a lively debate!

It has long since been my time to leave, but I have returned to do some work with a business partner and I am downtown and the homeless here is heartbeaking.

I went on a walk to get cigerattes (told you I was a fullsailer) in the wee hours of the morning and this nervous, korean woman of about 50 years of age started to talk to me thinking that I was a security guard at the building I walked out of. I had a hunch that she was in a strange place and under poor circumstances but she did NOT look the part. I was surprised.

She just lost her home and has reached what appears to be the deepest valley of her life, a slow decline it sounded like, as her belongings have all been taken from her in one sad story after another.

My surprise in all of this is that she does not appear or sound homeless, her english is native and she had been adopted by very religious parents. No drugs, no cigerattes, Here I am talking to a woman who by all accounts is 'better' than me and this is how harsh the world has been for her.

We talked, well, I mostly just listened and tried to offer whatever advice I could, really to no avail because I cant imagine being in her position yet I try to offer whatever I can to her.

Long story short, I'm trying to help her 'learn to fish' rather than giving her fish, although I have been trickling $20s to her.

Where are the job opportunities, can anyone give her a chance ?

She had her License taken away from her by a cop and needs to go to the DMV to get at least a photo ID. She has her social security card and recently got kicked out of lake eola by the police, showed the social security card to the cop and was terrified he would take it. The issue here with her paperwork (id and social security card) is that her original birth certificate is from Korea (being adopted) and should she loose this social security card she will have even more of a challenge to get the korean birth certificate and then the adoption papers.

Can anyone help to get this woman back on her feet ? What is the best course of action when she goes to the DMV to get an ID ?

I'm doing all of this because I would personally hire her. She does not come off like she is in the situation she is in, she has a chance. I felt she would be the most likely to get help and perform positively with this help.

Are there any shelters or churches she can go to ? 

She has no phone, I'm making an email account for her so she can go to the library and I can hopefully shepard her to brighter days. I told her to look for secretary or janitorial jobs at any tech company as they seem to be the only industry that is unilaterally doing well right now.

If anyone can offer any help, it is greatly appreciated. Like, beyond words appreciated. She is genuine and sincere and I have a video interview I shot of her as good measure but I kind of fucked up the shoot (cut her head off in the frame) so we might try again or I might edit it to be a better to view.

If anyone can help ME to help HER or even better if anyone can help HER directly, that would just be lovely. 

Please orlando you've been so good to me, lets be good to Jeannie.

Thanks,
Ryan

I was told that he didn't care if I was homeless with no gas or money, he wants me out. All I've done is try to make him proud and happy but all attempts have failed. I'm not looking for handouts, I'm willing to pay my way, but I don't receive my first paycheck until next Wednesday. I cant just live in my car as I'm a line cook and good personal hygiene is a must.

I spoke with the manager at a sports bar I play trivia at regularly in Altamonte Springs (just north of Orlando) about having a barcraft. They've got a couple dozen HDTVs and 4 projectors with 6 foot screens. 

He was very interested in the idea and would love to try it. When I asked about putting it on a couple of tvs, the manager suggested putting it on at least one of the projectors. He's also willing to pipe in audio as well. I'm going to do a test sometime in January, probably on a slow week night, to make sure the connection can handle a stream. Then the first official one would be for IPL4 (which IGN's site claims will be ""late February"").

So, I'm trying to gauge interest so I can let him know how many people to expect. Who'd want to come?

Check this out.,17,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/ngqus/rorlando_if_you_oppose_sopa_ive_got_a_plan_to_do/,"As some of you may know, an Orlando House representative, Sandy Adams, is on the House Judiciary committee.  This means her vote is very  important when they reconvene on the 21st to vote on SOPA.  They are going to try and push this bill through when no one is looking.  Rather than sit back and let that happen, I say we take charge and let her know that her district is going to be pissed if you votes yea in committee.  At this point we need to take some serious action.  Here are some things that we can do:

*I've put together a simple flyer, I'm going to make 500 copies and I'm going to hit the streets, knock on doors and ask people in her district to call her and let her know they oppose this bill.  

*Do sign wave events over the next few days and post footage on youtube.


I'm open for additional ideas as well.  I think the door to door method will be the most effective.  

TL;DR - Sandy Adams can help stop SOPA.  Let's take action.

Who's with me?  We can organize a meet up this weekend or Monday to get started.

Most of them are extremely cheap to get into (maybe $6 per car at the most) and a lot of fun. I grew up going to Wekiwa Springs and it is one of my favorites. You can rent a canoe, bring a kayak or just swim in the springs. There is a HUGE hole in the Springs if you like diving.  It's amazing.

Also there is Blue Spring State Park and it is absolutely beautiful. The water is so blue is almost glows. You can rent tubes here, canoes and kayaks or just go swimming. Also there are MANATEES here, but your best chance to see them is during the cooler months. 

Rock Springs is also a nice park. You usually rent intertubes (inner tubes? idk) and float down a natural lazy river. It is gorgeous. Bring goggles!! When I went there when I was a kid I used to find sharks teeth at the bottom, it was awesome. 

Another park I really like is Tosahatchee State Park off of 50. This one doesn't have water but it's a really nice place to hike and bird watch. I LOVE camping here, but it's a lot better to camp in the cooler months.  You can also drive around on the dirt roads to hiking spots. There are wild bulls and cows roaming, so it's pretty awesome! Also I've seen a few peregrine falcons (awesome) and once a bald eagle. 

Lastly, Little Big Econ which, I think, is also called the State Forest? It's in Oveido. It's also a dry one but it's good if you like to bike on dirt trails and appreciate nature. It's fun to bike because there are a lot of little obstacles to figure your way through! There are also equestrian and hiking trails here. 

**tl;dr If you're looking for some inexpensive fun, visit one of the local Florida state parks! Wekiwa Springs, Rock Springs and Blue Springs (manatees) for river fun, and Tosahatchee and Little Big Econ for hiking and biking! **

Edit: I forgot to add that you can bring your own stuff to these parks and it will be even cheaper! Tubes/kayaks/canoes, if you've got 'em, bring 'em! If not plan to add like 15-20$ on to your expenses. Except for the dry ones...those are free! 

Edit2: I would try to avoid these places on the weekends, they tend to get packed. Especially if you're there just to swim. If you canoe/kayak you'll be fine. And at the dry parks there will probably be very few people as well.

We’ll explore the different facets of solid-organ transplant and identify scientific breakthroughs that have helped us improve the quality of life among patients, and we’ll shed light onto the potential future of the field. Additionally, we will examine the fundamental principles of transplant and how they have resulted in medical and surgical innovation.

Giridhar Vedula MD is a multi-organ transplant surgeon at Florida Hospital, and focuses his practice primarily on liver, kidney and pancreas transplants. He trained at Columbia University in transplant surgery.

We are currently looking for a roommate to share our 4 bedroom/3 bath townhouse located on the corner of Rte 535 and Reams Rd, a mile down the road from Magic Kingdom cast member parking. 

Some stats: 

9.5' x 10' bedroom FULLY FURNISHED - single bed with nightstand, dresser, bookshelf, tv stand w/ tv 

Shared bathroom - you'd be sharing with one awesome roommate - and this is actually negotiable - we also have a downstairs bedroom (it's our office right now) with a full bath across the mini hallway, but that bathroom is also the ""common"" bathroom for guests or if you have to pee so bad you don't want to go upstairs. Your choice, we'll be happy to move our office upstairs if you don't want to regularly share your bathroom.

Utilities are INCLUDED!

Washer/Dryer, dishwasher, pool access - all the amenities ;)

We've got a [CAT!](http://i.imgur.com/KpCWJ.jpg?2) Try to contain your excitement...


We have a little attic if you need to store some stuff above our garage, and since we're already housing 3 cars, there's plenty of street parking out front ;)


My husband and I own our home, but we're struggling a bit at covering the mortgage, so we're saying the more the merrier! We're flexible about ""lease terms,"" but would prefer something longer than 7 months.


You'd be living with a delightful married couple (25 and 27) and their hilarious male roommate (31). We're all in the film industry in various aspects, and our home is 420 friendly :) 

We love movies, video games, and all things nerdy. We're looking for a roommate in a similar age range with similar interests who loves (or at least doesn't mind) action figures, because we have a ton of them adorning our house.


The neighborhood is super safe - a lot of families and Disney cast members. We're a pretty low-key bunch.

Thank you everyone for your kind words and concern, it's fantastic to know you all had his back (and mine). I'm deeply touched by all the response and upvotes.  :)

***

As I looked out on my back patio in horror at two dead, half-eaten kittens, I heard a screeching from behind an aloe plant. I found this [speck of a kitten](http://imgur.com/a/vhUQK#0), shivering and scared. 

He amazingly escaped death, he was a few feet from his siblings who were not so lucky. I think he saved his own life, once I got him inside I learned that he can't walk but he can scoot and climb like a champ, even though he still had his umbilical cord and his eyes are shut. He's a total bad-ass and a cuddle monster at the same time. I've temporarily named him Gorilla because of his long, black hair and because he loves to climb on me like a tree.

I wish I could keep him, but my roommate and I are both allergic and there's just no way. I'm his main caretaker (and I love it) but I'm sneezing all the time and my lungs itch. Plus, I'm not sure how I'm going to feed myself, let alone another tiny, toothless mouth.

• Would anybody like an adorable kitten with a huge personality? I know he's going to make an awesome friend for somebody. He seems to be in remarkably good health and I've taken excellent care of him for two days.

• Or, does anyone know of a momma cat with a small litter of kittens that he could maybe nurse with until we can find him a suitable home? I read that he really needs mother's milk for the antibodies. I would take him back when it's time for sure, no problem.

• Or, even, does anyone happen to have any extra kitten formula? I can put up with being a sneezy flem machine if I can figure out a way to get more food for his belly.

I'm a long-time redditor, 4 years, I don't want my acct tied to my location but I can PM you to verify. Thanks for any help or advice you can give.

Ive never even remotely thought of ever doing this, until today...
My story, and yes, its 100% true and I'm willing to prove it, if needed...
I am a 28yr old Us Army Vet with 2 tours in Iraq, with slight PTSD, anger issues, and emotional detachment problems I am working on with the VA. I am currently unemployed, broke, using food stamp cards to eat. My GF, Ashley, works at Chili's to supply us with enough cash for Power and internet
.
I live at home in my mother's foreclosing house in Clermont, FL while she lives with her boyfriend who she cant stand.My mother is attending Truck Driver school, because she cant get a job elsewhere. My father took our 401k, and life saving money, and ran off to Taiwan to never be heard from again, yes the divorce is in the process, but the property settlement is delayed because my mothers lawyer died in a car crash, no joke. Our family credit is ruined because the job market in FL is atrocious, I cant even get a job at Mc'Donalds.

I atteneded Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL until my student loans ran out, Guess who was my co signer, my father, with him gone and my credit ruined I couldnt get a 2nd loan. So my funds ran out. Some of you Vets / Miltary folk will ask why not use the GI Bill... I was using the Pre 9-11 GI BIll to pay for bills when I was in school. Full Sail is a accelerated school, its a BA in 2 years, each class is only 1 month instead of 2. You goto school for 8 hrs a day every day, plus homework and projects, you really dont have ANY time to work. So I paid for bills using the GI money, and Loans for school. I am currently in the process of getting back into school, but I owe them 20 grand for the Previous Balance of Tuition, so my acct is on hold until that gets Waived of they figure out what to do... Until then I am stuck in limbo. I will be using the Post 9 -11 GI Bill to cover school and get paid BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) in the future.

Now here's the shit that REALLY Sucks. My house is a GAS house. We cant Afford the gas so we let them come take the propane tank. That means we have no hot water, we have no stove, and to top it all off, my home AC unit compressor just broke. So for the last year, we have been taking cold ass showers, and using a Toaster Oven to cook dinner on, along with a microwave. Our choices of food style are limited.... Just recently the AC Broke. It is now 90 + Degrees in my house with windows open and fans in the windows.

I dunno what to do, or how to even get by anymore... I'm sitting here typing this out as sweat pours down me. I've gotten about 4 hrs of intermittent sleep in the last 3 - 4 days, because it is so hot in this house, you just wake up in sweat. My GF cant even get good sleep and yet she has to wake up and go to work every day or so. As a Man I feel worthless because I cant provide for her, and as a person, my living conditions are only upgraded from a homeless person which, unless I get back into school soon, I will be.

I dont know what to do, or who to turn to. So I turn to the masses that are Reddit. Advice, money, a favor called in from some one that knows of an AC Repair guy. A way to get a small loan for some one with bad credit. ANYTHING.... I have an Electric hot water heater, an Electric stove to trade or sell, (we cant afford to get the house wired for Electric Appliances)... If any one knows of some one that can get me a Job... Anything...

When:  Tuesday, 9 July 2013 - 6:00pm - 7:30pm

Orlando Public Library

101 E Central Blvd

Orlando, Florida 32801

Why do we see colors? Why don’t our eyes detect all wavelengths of light? Why is the sky blue and why are sunsets so colorful? Together with planetary scientists Dr. Addie Dove and Tracy Becker, we will address these questions, talk about the electromagnetic spectrum, and look at examples of how to change the way we see objects everyday. We will also learn how astronomers use telescopes that observe at different wavelengths of light to better understand our universe.

Tracy Becker is a graduate student in the physics department at the University of Central Florida on the Planetary Sciences track. She studies Saturn’s rings using data from the Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around Saturn. By looking at the way the tiny particles in the rings diffract starlight, she measures the sizes of some of the smallest dust particles in the rings. She runs the public outreach program at the Robinson Observatory at UCF and helped host the 2013 Southeast Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics.

Addie Dove, Ph.D., is a planetary scientist who currently holds a position as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Central Florida, and as the Laboratory Manager for the Center for Microgravity Research and Education (CMRE) there. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in May, 2012. Her thesis work was focused on the lunar plasma and dust environment, and her research expertise also includes lunar dust adhesion. At the CMRE, she leads laboratory-based studies of the behavior of planetary regolith in reduced gravity and normal gravity environments making use of parabolic airplane flights, suborbital rockets, the International Space Station, and a 0.8-second drop tower. She is a Co-Investigator of an experiment that will fly on the International Space Station to study low-velocity collisional behavior of small particles. She is also involved in a variety of outreach projects, and Co-Creator of the Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon).

**About Cafe Scientifique**

Every month, we drag a scientist out of the lab and down to the pub to talk about cool ideas. We sip drinks and ask questions. Café Scientifique, or just Science Cafe, is a monthly gathering of scientific experts and interested lay community in a pub or other nonacademic setting. We explore the latest ideas in science and technology, using plain language. Admission is free, and you need no reservation—just come ready to listen and contribute. Please join us!

This is your guide to the global meet-up on Saturday, June 15th, 1:00pm at Bill Frederick Park at Turkey Lake.

PETS ARE WELCOME.  SO ARE CHILDREN.  Just getting that out of the way.

Here is the original post: http://redd.it/1e1gat

We have created a facebook group for this event.  My friend /u/bootybyhershey will primarily be at the helm, with me running the business end in the background - getting us spaces reserved, etc.

At this point, the plan is for a barbecue (BYOB), and bars afterwards, so we hit all ages and demographics.  Over 120 people have joined the meet-up group, so we are expecting a large turnout, but probably not more than 50.  There has been a lot of discussion about adverse weather, which, examining the forecast, will be a likelihood, the seven day forecast does predict rain.  30% last I checked.

That being said, we need a backup plan with cover.  People typically do not like being in large groups of people without nice weather, or alcohol, so being realistic, if the weather sucks, our backup plan will probably be a restaurant that also serves alcohol, or someone can volunteer their house and we can have an inside barbecue with board/card/video games and movies.  I would volunteer my house if it weren't so far north of Orlando.

What that restaurant will be is what now needs to be discussed.  I will leave the floor open to those with good ideas, and will be updating the facebook group page so everyone who's interested stays informed.  If you have ANY concerns, you can PM me, and I will send you my number for texting/calling purposes, or communicate privately that way.

Please let us know if you are attending via a PM, or through the Facebook page.  We would like to get a realistic headcount, and then will make a summary update the day before so we have a game plan, and no one is left confused or wondering what's going on.  That way I can also contact you directly if something changes or falls through, or if we need to arrange rides.

Looking forward to a great meet-up - and seeing familiar faces and new ones as well.

* Earl K. Wood is dead: but his name lives on. Scott Randolph, local Democrat head, is running in his place.
* Partisan races, act as you're inclined.
* State amendments: if you're Republican/Tea Party, you're probably voting yes on some or all. If not, then probably no on all (Orange Dems are backing yes on 12; I'm personally opposed).
* County amendments: haven't seen any problems with whats proposed. County would get to fill elected vacancies; Pine Hills, UCF, and the area north of Hunter's Creek could create local villages; some standardization of local gambling laws.
* Circuit Judge 9, Group 7: Marques vs Wilson. As far as I can tell, its a Cuban Republican with years in law, vs a divorce lawyer that was an army vet. I believe both ran in a larger primary back in the Summer.
* County Commission #3: Clarke vs Damiani. ~~Both are Republicans~~; the former has some healthcare background; the latter was appointed for a year after that mess with the commissioner doing jail time.

I'm vacationing to Orlando in a week with a group of friends for the second time. We all came here in 2010 after turning 21 and had a blast and are now looking for some more suggestions to make this trip different from last.   

What we did last time: downtown Disney (House of Blues on Industrial Night), Fire and Ice lounge, CityWalk, Magic Kingdom, and spent most days at the pool except one rainy day we ended up going to some outdoor mall that was near our hotel.  

All we have planned so far this time is to go to Islands of Adventure/Universal for a day or two. Otherwise we'll be at our pool during sunny days and looking for bars/clubs at night.  So I guess I what I'm asking for is some ideas for nightclubs/bars for night and also some emergency rainy-weather type things we can do during the day just in case we can't spend our entire vacation at the pool. Also we will have one male friend with us and would like to bring him to a gay bar :)  So any suggestions for that would be helpful as well! Thanks!

I'm in a punk band, and the house we practice in just got broken into (it's in the Lake Ecconlockhatchee area). The thieves stole a brand-new bass amp, a flatscreen TV, a PS3 and a bunch of games, some money, and my Marshall MG 100hdfx head and Marshall MG 412 cabinet. 

We're all students and too poor to buy new equipment and we can't play until this has been recovered, so if you have any information on this, I would really appreciate it. If you see anything on Craigslist or in any pawn shops, please, please let me know.

Thank you so much.

We had a grand whopping total of 33 redditors show up last night to Oblivion, most of whom stayed the whole night.  Darts were played, the beer and food was delicious.  

The 'after party' at Sports Town was also a lot of fun, and we stayed until last call, playing drunken Ping Pong and also enjoying their draft selection.  It was nice to see so many lovely ladies and handsome fellows there, make new friends and see familiar faces.

I would really love if someone could post about how the Wekiva Springs meet up went.  

Now, because this was a hot topic last night -

Regarding drama: To the few people that started it, I hope you understand that the majority of us have zero intention of picking sides, and will support each other, because we're friends.  End of story. 

Future Meet Ups: Some friendly requests have been made for other days and locations.  I think we need to give more notice, to accommodate everyone.  Tasty Tuesdays seem to be a popular choice, let's definitely go somewhere other than Oblivion, as we live in one of the biggest cities in the US and should explore those options.

I am a big fan of attorney [Jon Gutmacher's book on Florida firearms laws](http://www.floridafirearmslaw.com/p/Florida-Firearms-Law-Use-Ownership-Book-7th.html). Whenever I meet someone who just got their CWP or is in the middle of the process of getting it, I will hand over my most recent copy of the book. 


I figured, I would extend that to r/orlando.


While I support everyone to carry a gun legally, I also want everyone to be educated about the laws in Florida. 
I can't stop criminals or stupidity but I think I can help out with the education part of legal gun owners, as our statutes are difficult to read. 
I think I can do that by providing an easy to read translation of the legalese that is in our state's law books.


I obviously don't have unlimited funds and this is not some promotion funded by the author. I am buying the book at full retail price and giving it away. Simply for the purpose that we have one more educated law abiding gun owner, giving criminals pause to think twice before committing a crime. All the while ensuring that legal gun owners don't end up losing their rights because they didn't know the laws.

I don't need this to turn into a contest but depending on the number of replies, an upvote worthy reply will help you get a book. ;)

After shipping and taxes, they run little over $38 dollars.

I have not determined the number of books I can afford, nor do I have any idea of the expected response.
I will commit to at least two books right now, regardless.

I am reaching out to some fellow florida gun owners, if they want to help support my tiny cause. So that number may go up. 

I am not going to spam other subreddits to gather upvotes, donations, some funding or anything. 

This is just me, running into you at the pizza joint, striking up a conversation, ending up handing you the book.

This is just me wanting to give a little thing to someone in orlando. 


Thanks, MrTorben

I am a student at Valencia College, working toward a degree in dental hygiene.

That's right.  Free dental cleaning for your kid/neice/nephew/friend's kid/etc.!

If at all possible, I need someone who can come this Tuesday, the 5th of June, at about 1:45pm.  However, if you can't make that appointment, still send me a message and I'll see about shifting my schedule around to fit you in.  Also, if the child is under age 12, please still contact me if you are interested; I will have to move my schedule to make room for a longer appointment, but I just need one more pediatric patient by June 12th.

My goal here is to create a comprehensive and detailed list that can be linked to (from the sidebar, even) as a standard response. Because reddit has a 10k character limit for a single post, I will be splitting this up by neighborhood.

If you're all into this idea, please respond with your recommendations below; I'll edit this post to include contributions from others. Please include: 

* a link to the restaurant's website, if one is available. If not, I would suggest linking to an appropriate review aggregator like UrbanSpoon.

* a link to a google map with the restaurant's location. If it's a food truck, link to their twitter feed.

* a brief review of the restaurant and what makes it notable

* a quick price estimate for a full meal, including at least one appropriate drink ($ = &lt; 10$/person, $$ is up to 20$/person, $$$ up to 50$/person, $$$$ &gt; 50$/person)

I think we should try to avoid larger chains since the goal here is to showcase what Orlando has to offer, but we can make some exceptions if we get significant consensus or if the chain is primarily local (for example, I think Ceviche, Mellow Mushroom, and probably Tijuana Flats deserve a spot on the list, but I would be hesitant to include something like Melting Pot). If somebody posts a recommendation for a restaurant but there's significant controversy/dissenting opinion, I'll add a note in the review and permalink to the discussion thread. Feel free to use personal opinion in the reviews--it should be clear that this is all local opinion, and not objective scientific FOOD FACT. I'll include a link to the user who submits the review at the end of each entry.

What I've got here isn't intended to be comprehensive, but I wanted it to serve as a launching point for further input. Let's review some restaurants!

I've messaged the mods and if this idea takes off, the posts will be linked to in the sidebars. Once these posts have been up for a while, I will remove this preamble from all of them.

* [Chez Vincent](http://chezvincent.com/)/Hannibal's On the Square
([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=chez+vincent+in+orlando&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.596011,-81.356352&amp;spn=0.07732,0.182476&amp;sll=44.799163,-0.567095&amp;sspn=7.99797,23.356934&amp;t=w&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=chez+vincent&amp;hnear=Orlando,+Orange,+Florida&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A))
$$$

 Another French offering, Chez Vincent easily fits in the ""top French
cuisine class of Orlando restaruants, though I'm not familiar with any
claims of local sourcing of ingredients here. Daily specials are
available and will feature seasonale fare. The strongest offering Chez
Vincent offers is their (award-winning!) souffle. It's easily the best
I've ever had, and is worth a visit on its own.

* [The Ravenous Pig](http://theravenouspig.com/)
([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=ravenous+pig&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=ravenous+pig&amp;hnear=Orlando,+Florida+32804&amp;t=w&amp;z=14))
$$$

 The Ravenous Pig bills itself as an ""American Style Gastropub""--the
concept being upscale style pub food and drink fare. Frequently touted
as one of the best restaruants in Orlando, you're unlikely to find
yourself disappointed. It is HIGHLY recommended that you call in for a
reservation if you want to dine on a weekend (assuming you want a
table as opposed to bar seating), and it's still not a bad idea even
if you're going during the week. The dishes served are usually quite
creative, and manage to very effectively class up traditional pub
concepts. Ingredients are locally sourced, so the menu will vary
seasonally. Be sure you don't neglect their cocktails (also frequently
rotating), especially their trademark ""Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned""
(bacon-infused Buffalo Trace bourbon with vanilla maple syrup and
bitters--the only offering on the cocktail menu that's always available).

* [Cocina 214 ](http://www.cocina214.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Cocina+214,+East+Welbourne+Avenue,+Winter+Park,+FL&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=28.596741,-81.350125&amp;sspn=0.00162,0.00273&amp;oq=cocina+winter+park,+fl&amp;t=w&amp;hq=Cocina+214,&amp;hnear=E+Welbourne+Ave,+Winter+Park,+Orange,+Florida+32789&amp;z=17))  $$$$

 My one experience with Cocina 214 was lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in the summer.  They have an outdoor area (we had a small dog) under heavy shade and it was not hot at all (a little steamy but that's FLA for ya).  I went straight for the Margarita menu.  Definitely going to pay &gt;$10 for a very very good margarita.  Fresh ingredients, no high fructose corn syrup ""sweet and sour mix"", just some agave syrup, lime juice and tequila.  

 We started off with an appetizer special (not on the main menu, they had a nice ""daily"" specials menu) of lightly dusted and sauteed rock shrimp with some kind of aioli mixed with chiles.  The rest of the meal was excellent but since it was last summer (and multiple margaritas) I don't really remember what I had but I remember being impressed with just about everything (I'm the kind of person to try a sample of your food to get an idea of the rest of the menu of a new place).  

 We had two young children with us so afternoons were kid and dog friendly. --[EntityDamage](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1om0/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/c3u7nuz)

 Great selection of gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches, great selection of craft beers on tap, also great vegetarian options. IMHO the best pizza around Central Florida. Great atmosphere, great service. I recommend you try ""The Magical Mistery Tour"", ""Kosmic Karma"", ohh and the Spinach dip! --[whywhy1](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1om0/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/c3u9cfu)",,False,,t5_2qh7s,True,,,True,t3_q1om0,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1om0/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/,

There was a lot of interest last week and at the meetup for a Grub Crawl. The date will most likely be Saturday, August 6th, starting in the late afternoon and going as late as folks want to stay. 

What we need is suggestions for places to go. The first spot will be Hawker's Asian Street Fare for appetizers but we still need:
- a place for main dish (I was thinking one of the Vietnamese places for pho and bahn mi)
- a sushi place
- someplace for dessert/coffee
- a bar for drinking after

All the places need to:
- be able to fit 20-25 people and serve us fairly quickly
- be affordable
- fit our Asian theme
- be withing walking distance or a very short drive of each other.

So let me know where you'd like to go and I'll make some phone calls and ask about seating and such. Also keep an eye on the facebook group because I'll be making an event there tonight.

They've become territorial, destructive, and nothing we've done in the past 8 1/2 months to curb this behavior has worked. It's obvious that no one is happy in the current situation-- myself, my husband, or the cats. It absolutely breaks my heart to have to seek out new homes for them, especially because they were absolute angels prior to my pregnancy. But as the house fills up with baby gear, it's becoming more and more apparent that something's got to give.

So we're looking for child-free homes for both of them. They do not need to go together, as they never really got super attached to each other. Both are males, neutered, and completely up to date on shots and vet visits.

[Cheeseburger](http://imgur.com/BH9ditr)
Cheeseburger is approximately 8 years old and is front-declawed. He recently had a ton of dental work done which involved the extraction of a few of his teeth, so his tongue sticks out about 85% of the time. There's a cap on the amount of attention he likes to receive. He'll hang around and let you pet him for about 10 minutes, and then he'll get bored and go nap in a corner. No joke, this cat sleeps for the vast majority of the day. He'd be perfect for a bachelor who may not have a TON of time to devote to a pet, as he requires very little maintenance. 

[The Small, Shitty One](http://imgur.com/M9czhBr)
Don't let the name fool you, he's the most snuggly little jerk on the face of the earth. He is small, however-- only about 7 pounds at 2 years old. He has a lot of feral behaviors so he'd be great for someone who has a porch or LOTS of big windows. He's a strictly indoor cat but loves to watch birds. A childless couple would probably be the best match for him, as he really does see himself as a baby.

Look, I hate doing this. I hate being THOSE people who had to get rid of their first 'children' in order to make way for their human child. It's absolutely breaking my heart. But I can't watch the space my cats are permitted to dwell in keep shrinking because their tiny cat-brains can't accept the changes that are happening. Please let me know if you're interested in one or both and we'll be contacting people this week to try and find the best fits for them.

Also, if you know of any rescues that currently have openings, please let us know so we can start to figure out back-up plans. I absolutely cannot and will not have these cats go to a shelter.

I know there's been a lot of ticket posts lately, but I'm wondering if there's someone here who's had a similar situation to mine.  I recently received a notice that my license is going to be suspended due to failure to pay three tickets, all for toll violations (two in Orange county, one in Lake county).  There are a few problems with this, though:

1.  I never received any tickets or notices or warnings whatsoever prior to the one notice I got that warned of the upcoming suspension for failure to pay.
2.  I have an E-Pass account with a transponder (one of the newer ones), and the E-Pass account currently has money in it, so if I ever owed any amount in tolls due to my balance being too low, it's long since been paid and settled with E-Pass.  How can they ticket me if I've paid the toll?

In addition, I'm worried that, no matter which course of action I take, they'll suspend my license anyway.  A friend of mine had that happen to him--he got a ticket, paid the fine, then a month later had his license suspended for failure to pay the ticket that he'd already paid.  (I've seen the paperwork and account history from the county for his ticket.  Said friend never received any notices, no tickets or even a notice of suspension, and only found out that his license was suspended when he was later pulled over for speeding.  The officer who pulled him over that time was just as confused as he was as to why his license was suspended.  He wound up having to pay over a thousand dollars to have it reinstated, too, because they kept stalling on giving him his court date...)

Aside from hiring a traffic attorney, is there anything I can do?  I'm reluctant to pay a ticket that I feel I shouldn't have gotten, due to my having an E-Pass account.

We've done this a few times in the past, and it has always turned out great. We need someone who is willing to work a set schedule of 10 to 20 hours a week in Winter Park. We work around school schedules. The initial position is for 90 days and pays $10.00/hour. If those 90 days go well, there is definitely room for the intern to come on full-time (we have had this happen a few times already). The majority of the work will be done in Python. If you've never used Python before, we won't count that against you at all. We are looking to hire as soon as possible.

**Experience**: This is an internship, and we are willing to spend a good portion of the time teaching and working with the intern. That said, you will need to have a decent grasp of object oriented concepts. You need to know what classes are, how inheritance works, etc. That is really the only technical requirement for the position. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The project**: Work for a non-profit that helps people with disabilities locally. Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the company use. The software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems.

**Applying**: Send resumes and questions to ameng@cilorlando.org. Please make sure your resume is no longer than one page. Do not try to contact via Reddit PM.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,1344953523.0,,,True,t3_y7ane,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/y7ane/looking_to_hire_a_programming_intern_in_winter/,
