1331130912.0,1765,self.DAE,qlqzd,"Am I the only one who is suspicious about Invisible Children, the organisation behind Kony 2012?",5324,3559,986,http://www.reddit.com/r/DAE/comments/qlqzd/am_i_the_only_one_who_is_suspicious_about/,"Lets try this in a better sub reddit... 

I've done a fair bit of looking into it, and everything doesn't add up. Heres my findings and I have included sources. Will probably get down voted to hell but I hope to give at least one of you a better understanding of whats going on.

Theres ALWAYS two sides to every story. This viral film has caught the attention of heaps of young folk but you are all far too late. Watching that Kony video is essentially watching old news. They started filming in 2003, and northern Uganda has been free of LRA violence and war for over five years. In fact, the LRA have signed a peace accord! They are rebuilding and are restoring the peace.

Yes the leader is still out there however the recruitment of children has decreased 80%. This isn't due to the Invisible Children organisation, its because Ugandan military and the ICC have intercepted.
The Invisible Children group are trying to pass a bill that allows America to militarise the region... They are providing misinformation to woo idealistic followers. The group have combined multiple regional conflicts to make it appear that this is one rapidly increasing issue. When confronted about their dodgy tactics, the head spokesperson stated;

“I agree with you that leading people to believe that the war is still happening in Uganda is not ethically right. It's something we've been addressing internally, focusing on getting all staff and supporters on the same page (of communication).""

If you read the news, or even had an ounce of interest in the on-going unrest in Africa you would already know this and not be fooled. Yes, awful things happen to people in 3rd world countries but this has been occurring for centuries, it isn't a recent occurrence.

I think its only fair if I am to make such comments I provide sources (unlike the people over at Invisible Children...)

SOURCES:
Michael Kirkpatrick, a long-time Independent Global Citizen, he has resided in Uganda and other regions of Africa. He has no political, religious or financial agenda. He wrote this article and gave an in-depth insight to whats really going on. He also questioned important members of Invisible Children about their motives. http://www.blackstarnews.com/news/122/ARTICLE/6586/2010-06-02.html

Charity Navigator is a website that breaks down the proceeds and donations given to Invisible Children and subsequently shows what percentile of that is REALLY going towards these impoverished kids. A measly slither of what is going into the founders pockets. http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=12429

I've read an interesting passage from Northern Ugandan man however it is not 100% verified - he has advised the Northern Ugandan parliament have listed IC as their main priority on their ""fraudulent activity"" list. (See 2nd comment, username Livingstone). http://www.topix.com/forum/city/stuart-fl/TQJSGHMES035Q6OI0

THIS article asking Invisible Children why they were pressuring poor AND illegal piece of legislation has since been removed and deleted. http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2010/03/oklaholdout-update-letter-from-lisa-dougan/

ADDITIONALLY - There were members of Invisible Children were saying what their ""allowance"" could purchase them, it was on a forum on the official website, and this has also been REMOVED. http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/?p=5901

I am freaky patriotic. My most prized possession is a vintage 48-star flag (I'm from Arizona, 48th state) and my favorite holidays are Independence Day and Valentine's Day (because AZ became a state on February 14th, 1912!).

But it just makes me embarrassed for everyone, especially the soldier/vet, when someone gushes like that. Often the ""hero"" tends to just look down out of pure discomfort and mutter a humble *thank you*.

You don't know ANYTHING about this person other than they were in the army once and now they're not.

Maybe he's a shitbag who beats his gf. Maybe she mowed down a school full of Afghanis for perverted enjoyment. Maybe he's a bigot who wants to hang every last dark-skinned human on the planet. Maybe she's a whore who cheated nonstop on her last deployment. Maybe he's just a totally lazy idiot who couldn't hack it as a civilian and freaked out when his first kid was born out of wedlock and he hadn't even turned 20 yet.

Or...yeah, maybe she's a heroic human being who lives with strength, grace and dignity and does the armed forces, our country and the human race proud. But there's no way you could fucking know that in 13 1/2 seconds of conversation. So chill out with your Ameriboner and just talk to people like people.

Am I alone on this one?

I know we can tell when someone is ""color blind"" when they can't distinguish between certain colors, but that's not what I am talking about here.

I'm not great at communicating ideas, but let me try to elaborate: we all (except the colorblind) can distinguish at least 7 colors (ROYGBIV). But, for example, I only know that green is green, because I saw some grass and my mother told me it was ""green"" colored. That doesn't prove to me that we are seeing the same color, only that the grass is a color that we both call green. 

What if her eyes see ""green"" as the color that I learned to be red and vice versa? If I visited her brain, I would see the grass as what I would call red, but my mom just calls it green because that is the color that she knows to be green. Woah. Back to my brain and it looks normal green again.

There is probably some science about how the human eye works that proves we all see the same colors, but out of curiosity, I've always wanted to be inside someone else's brain, just to see precisely how they perceive the world.

Anyone else?

...get really good at drawing

Of course, when I do get some free time, nothing is nearly as appealing as it seems when I'm busy.   That may be due to the fact that even if I take a week off from work, or my wife and kids are out of town, I know that my free time is only temporary, so it seems pointless to start up some longterm project.

So I've even imagined winning the lottery and never having to work again.  And even being single as well, with no responsibilities at all.  Even then, I feel that I would probably just sit around staring at the walls (or just reading reddit!) all day.

I don't have much student debt and I really don't have any close friends anymore. I really wouldn't be missing anything!

So I live in buffalo and I want to move somewhere. I am pretty tech savvy but have only been going to school for comp sci for 1.5 years of a 4 year degree. Not much to do on that though I love the subject I hate school. I feel like it moves too slow for me and I am bored with driving 40 minutes to school every day to learn what I could have in an hour at home from the textbook. I think I could find a job and teach myself the rest of what I need to know and I don't think that is too ignorant. I have worked some pretty rough jobs to get by before anyways (as a mover which is tough on the body for 10$/hr and obviously other unqualified labor).

I think I have a time frame now where if I really don't have the mentality to finish school I should just leave so I am not being pressured into the same old crap, not to mention I feel the will to both move on and start anew. 

I mean, I wouldn't be doing this in like a day or two so I would think about this a lot, I.e., where to go, having a place to stay, and maybe even have a job lined up.

I had an old friend that did just this and stayed with relatives, she seems happy about it though I havn't spoken to her in over a year now.

I get along with people well...but only on my terms, where' I'm leading the show. I'm not like a diva either...just don't like participating in what feels like lemming-like activities.

I think people who like reality TV and religiously watch singing competition shows are of lesser intelligence.

My friend of a decade, let's call him R (I don't care if he finds this, he's already informed me that he knows my reddit name) I really like him because he's intelligent and creative but when we get together... we say the most vile things to each other, and pretty much always have. Pretty much imagine it and we've said worse. Almost every conversation usually ends with ""i hope you die"" Of course we are both kidding (i hope). I then have this other friend, we'll call him E. We haven't known each other as long, and we've never even met. We've talked on the phone, skyped, stuff like that. He lives in ny, and i'm in nj so we plan on meeting soon. Again, he's very intelligent and creative but our relationship is 100% different. We're always talking about how we value each other's intellect and insight, and talking about serious tihngs and life issues. R and I are the same age (24) and E is 3 years younger, dunno if that matters. So really what it boils down to.. Do you have REALLY good friends who you often treat like they are your most hated enemy but deep down you know you'll almost certainly always be friends because let's face it, nobody else would put up with either of us, and because they are totally awesome people?

People that are afraid to go to the hospital because of the bills they will get. People literally *dying* because of it.

I read about politicians lying through their teeth, making fake promises and also abusing *their* power. Insider trading, tax cuts, accepting money from lobbyists, letting corporations walk all over our individual rights as the people *we elect to protect them* stand by accepting the money the business give to make it happen without a second thought.

That's an overstatement, but I guess what I'm really getting at is that I have no type.  It's actually sort of baffling to me that people do have types and more or less stick to them when dating.  None of my ex-girlfriends or women that I've dated really look like each other.  There's no real common thread in physical attributes like height, weight, race, body type, etc., and their personalities have been pretty diverse as well.

I'm not quite sure if it's a pro or a con, but it's greatly expanded my dating pool.  On the one hand, I can hit the town and pretty much be guaranteed to find multiple women I find attractive, however that opens up the possibility the person I talk to will be undesirable in some other way.

One definite con is that it often it's created a certain degree of insecurity with my girlfriends.  A lot of times my girlfriends doubt whether I really find them attractive because they feel like the pool of what I find attractive is so wide that they just fall in there by default.  I don't find EVERY woman attractive, but for some reason I get that reputation.

When I try to have a type or be more focused, I end up having these weird, fleeting fetishes.  I'm an ass man at the core, but right now boobs are the thing, and I want to date a woman with huge boobs.  Or I'll get into redheads, or really tall women, or women with freckles, or whatever may come into my head.

""...nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, color, sex, religion, etc.... Theyre all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything.""

This quote was plastered all over the place and really annoyed me. It's a nice sentiment (don't hurt people, don't discriminate, life's fleeting, love people). That said, IMO this was just some vapid sound bite that people grabbed onto, without it really making sense when you think about it:

-Not sure why the haves would hurt the have-nots. People generally hurt people for want of things they don't have (money, power, food, sex, etc.)

-I can think of a few things one might have that are worth hurting others to protect, if said ""things"" were in danger and in need of defending: one's children, freedom, personal safety...

-Not sure why the quote shifts from being about giving up all desire for things to not discriminating for dumb shit--but we'll let it slide.

-Kind of betrays the previous point to follow up the bit about not discriminating with the overall reduction that they're all just people...aren't they so much more than just some generalization (not just color, sex, race and other generalized bs.)

-You could probably lose a lot by trying to love people--which doesn't mean one shouldn't try to--but makes me think this quote is baloney. Love is about risk, and the potential to lose, but taking that risk despite it. 

For example, trying to feel the love of a seemingly heart-touching AMA from a supposedly terminally-ill person might end up costing your trust and faith in this lovefest we call Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fzhvr/i_believe_lucidending_was_fiction_ama_sorry/

Regardless of whether LucidEnding is legit or not, can we stop parading around this stupid quote. It makes Redditors no better than Christian fundamentalists who want to post John 3:16 and other select Bible soundbites all over the place...

tl;dr: LucidEnding's quote makes no sense--please stop treating it like some kind of life scripture.
