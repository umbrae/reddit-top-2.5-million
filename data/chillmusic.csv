1373031986.0,140,self.chillmusic,1hout5,Guide to Nujabes,157,17,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/chillmusic/comments/1hout5/guide_to_nujabes/,"(Posted this in /r/music, didn't get much attention. Figured you guys would appreciate it much more.)

Seba Jun, a legend in the music industry, although his name is unknown to many. Nujabes produces a very magical kind of music, and has garnered quite the cult following because of it. Adult Swim often used to play Nujabes beats during the little ""bumps"" between shows, so you might recognize some of his work from there. His music is a real experience, thought-provoking and relaxing, and nearly all of his fan's would tell you the same. Nujabes released 3 studio albums, 4 singles, and worked extensively producing the Samurai Champloo soundtrack, along with Fat Jon, Minmi, and Force of Nature. His career tragically ended on February 26th, 2010, after a car accident in Shibuya, Tokyo, we'll get more in-depth about that later. But enough intro, let's get to the core of Nujabes, what you all came for.

**Metaphorical Music (2003)**

Metaphorical Music was Nujabes' first solo album, under the Hydeout Productions label. He achieved most of his recognition through this album, although he did have a small following beforehand, for his work in Hydeout's first compilation album. This album features many rappers/producers from the label, including Substantial, Pase Rock, and  Five Deez, among others. Metaphorical Music is a very good showcase of what Nujabes can do, as each track has it's own flavor, something that makes it unique. As with all of his music, the production is perfect, and the composition is master-class.

&gt;Album Highlights:

* [Lady Brown (Feat. Cise Starr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5powxvY5YfE) - Probably places top 5 in my favorite tracks from Seba, a very romantic, warm track, and the vocals blend so perfectly with the smooth beats. 

* [Counting Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O0kuoiAm2A) - Showcases his amazing ability to sample, while making it fluid enough to fit in with the beat that has already been established early in the song.

* [Horn in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ciTMOIjnj0) - Complete with a John Coltrane interview playing in the background, this track shows how much old jazz/blues influenced Nujabes' music.

**Modal Soul (2005)**

Arguably the best album that Nujabes released, this album contains so many real classics that people associate with his legacy. Modal Soul really helped shoot him into the public-eye (among the instrumental hip-hop scene, at least), along with his aforementioned work on the Samurai Champloo soundtrack in 2004.  This album introduces and perfects the sound that Seba Jun is most well-known for, laid-back beats, catchy samples, and instruments of all varieties. Again, he brings along some vocalists/rappers from the Hydeout Productions label for the ride.

&gt;Album Highlights

* [Reflection Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qU2MXeAz1E) - One of his most catchy songs, the basic drum beat, beautiful piano, and optimistic vocal samples all add up to song you'll often find yourself tapping your pen along to during your workday.

* [Feather (Feat. Cise Starr &amp; Akin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2wg2T16Xg) - The kind of track that you wish were longer, I could honestly listen to this song for hours on end.

* [Luv(Sic) Part 3. (Feat. Shing02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyoYf7rZVGI) - A small piece of one of Nujabes' greatest works, which I'll talk about more later, all of his work with Shing02 is golden.

**Spiritual State (2011)**

I know what you're thinking; ""2011? /u/Old_Book, I thought you said he died in 2010!"", and you're correct, he did. Nujabes was in the process of completing this album upon his death. Spiritual State was finished posthumously by those close to him, using instrumentals Nujabes had already produced. This album has a generally more heavy feeling to it, a lot of the songs use deep, lush pads, and have a lower-than-average BPM. Many Nujabes fans agree that this was an immaculate send-off for his shortlived presence as a producer.

&gt;Album Highlights:

* [Spiritual State (feat. Uyama Hiroto)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0AvO0oBmUA) - A very relaxing track, it really takes you to another world. The piano is delightfully well played, and the backing percussion is mesmerizing.

* [City Lights (feat. Pase Rock &amp; Substantial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lkcHrHdI-M) - The vocals and beat in this song remind me of something like a John Legend song, one of my favorites on the album.

* [Color of Autumn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uZQtXNOESs) - I'm sure most people wouldn't place this as a real ""highlight"" of the album, but I think it deserves a spot on here, as it's a real throwback to the Jazz music that his music is so heavily influenced by.

[**Luv(Sic) feat. Shing02 (2002-2013)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfguhnvECc)

As I said mentioned earlier, Nujabes and Shing02 were a real match-made-in-heaven so to speak. The entire Luv(Sic) series is a beautiful showcase of Nujabes' work throughout his life. From parts 1-6, Shing02 rhymes about all the different ordeals and pleasures that come along with love. Parts 1-5 were recorded during Nujabes' lifetime, and part 6 was completed by Shing02 and some of his other close friends after allegedly finding the instrumental he had produced for it on his cell phone just weeks after his death. Luv(Sic) isn't just music, it's a 
journey, and my absolute favorite piece of music in the world.

**Conclusion:**

So that's my quick introduction to Nujabes, for you. I hope I've helped you learn more about him, and hopefully led some of you to continue listening to all the rest of his music. If you enjoy this style of music, I highly recommend that you go buy/listen to the compilation album ""Mellow Beats, Friends &amp; Lovers"", which includes Nujabes among quite a few other really great artists. Sorry this isn't nearly as good as most of the other ""guides"", but I feel that a lot of his music speaks for itself, a story packed into every song.
