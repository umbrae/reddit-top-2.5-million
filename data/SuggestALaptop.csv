**What is Clevo?**

Clevo is an original design manufacturer (ODM) who creates shells of laptops (the chassis and the specifications). Clevo then sells these shells to other companies who then fill in these shells with components and sells them to us. Many companies such as Sager, a whole host of Clevo sellers, Origin, Falcon Northwest and pre-Dell Alienware use Clevo shells for their offerings. It may not be a name someone off the street would know, but many computer forums recommend their products for their power and their price efficiency. Here is a good but slightly outdated document that explains what Clevo is: http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/592609-clevo-guide-v3-0-faq-reseller-info-read-before-posting.html  .

**General Notes about Clevo Laptops**

* Clevo laptops are very value-oriented. To receive the same level of performance that one can find in Clevo models with another company you can expect to pay a significant amount more. This does not mean that the laptops are cheaply built. Many people have had their Clevo laptops for 3+ years.

* When people hear of the Clevo models that have replaceable CPUs/GPUs, they automatically assume that they will be able to buy the new chip 3 years down the line, put it in the laptop and essentially have a new laptop. This is NOT the case. While that is theoretically possible, newer CPUs and GPUs have different sockets. GPUs are currently MXM 3.0b, which hasn't changed for a while, but different Intel processors always need a new motherboard since the socket changes. If you only want to buy a Clevo because it can upgrade to a Haswell processor (Intel's next step after Ivy Bridge), don't do it.

* All Clevo models have Optimus technology for Nvidia GPUs or the AMD equivalent for AMD GPUs.

* The optical drive in Clevo models can be swapped out for another hard drive. This is how many people get 2 drives in their laptops. A external CD drive can be used with the laptop.

* Make sure that the machine you are ordering has Windows selected if you want it. Not everyone offers it in the base model.

* Expect most Clevo models to be around a size up from what their screen size suggests. What I mean by this is that my 15” P150EM will barely fit in a 15” case, I had to obtain a 17” case for it.

* The power bricks that are included with these laptops are really large. If you are reluctant to buy a laptop with a large power brick do not buy a Clevo model.

* I would not say that Clevo laptops have a level of construction similar to a Macbook Pro or some Thinkpads. Mine at least has minimal flex, but I still wouldn't put it on the same level.

**Clevo Laptops**

*Clevo W150ER*

This is the point where in my opinion you should start looking at Clevo offerings. This is a 15” laptop with 2 hard drive bays and an optical drive, but remember that this laptop is closer in size to a 17” model from another manufacturer. It isn't too heavy with a weight of 6.17lb (2.8 kg). The GPU on this model is again 650m, which is sufficient to run most games at medium to high settings at native resolution (1080p). This model has a single fan, is made with plastic, the GPU is not removable (it's soldered to the motherboard) and it has 2 RAM slots.

*Clevo W170ER*

This is a bigger version of the W150ER. It is essentially the same model as the 150ER but with a 17”screen size, 2 hard drive bays and an optical drive. It has a weight of 7.05lb (3.2kg).

*Clevo W110ER*

This is a small form factor laptop (11”) with the capability to hold only 1 hard drive, but it packs a significant punch and is the best small gaming laptop out right now (especially since the M11x series is MIA). It weighs 3.97lb (1.8kg). It has a single fan, a soldered Nvidia GT 650m and 2 RAM slots. It also has the ability to upgrade to quad-core CPUs, which is not something any other 11” laptop can do at the moment. It is made using plastic.

*Clevo P151EM*

This is a strong gaming laptop. It has a 15” screen but only 1 hard drive bay and an optical drive, as opposed to the 2 hard drive bays and an optical drive on the W150ER. It has a weight of 6.83lb (3.1kg). The GPU on this model is a 670m, which can run some games on ultra and most on high-ultra settings at 1080p. It has dual fans (one for the CPU and one for the GPU), as well as the ability to replace both the CPU and the GPU down the line, and is made using plastic.

*Clevo P150EM*

It is similar to the P151EM, but has the ability to upgrade to the GTX 675m/AMD 7970m graphics cards because of a larger power brick (180W vs 120W on the P151EM). It also has a backlit keyboard, which the P151EM does not have, and it has a rubberized finish as opposed to a plastic finish.

*Clevo P170EM*

This is similar to the P150EM, but it has a 17” screen, 2 hard drive bays and an optical drive, as well as some aluminum on the palmrest and an even bigger power supply (220W). It weighs 8.6lb (3.9kg).

*Clevo P270WM*

This is an upcoming model. It will contain a high end desktop processor, dual video card support, 3 hard drive bays and an optical drive, and an earth-shattering 30 minutes of battery life. It is not portable weighing in at around 12lb (5.4kg). This is quite literally a moveable desktop.

**How to upgrade a Clevo laptop (and the ideas apply to most other laptops)**

To do this I shall be going through the options available while configuring a P170EM on mythlogic (Mythlogic Pollux 1712) and factoring in a few differences from other laptops.

**Screen**

All of the Clevo models that I have laid out above (with the exception of the W110ER) come with 1080p screens. This is good.

One of the decisions that has to be made is whether to choose a glossy or a matte screen. Matte screens are sunlight-readable and non-reflective, while glossy screens have more vibrant colours but can act like mirrors and are not sunlight-readable. Consider your intended usage when choosing.

Another choice to make is the colour gamut of the screen that you are choosing. The colour gamut is expressed as a percentage of the NTSC colour gamut (which is a colour spectrum involving all the colours the eye can see). The higher the percentage the more colours the screen can show. To see all the colours in the Adobe spectrum, you require 72% NTSC.

It is worth noting that some people will see the differences and some can't. My mother can point out “look at that shade of blue” while I cannot see the difference when comparing it to another screen. Don't expect everything to be amazing. I will say that my 95% screen has a very nice colour saturation though.

Here is a nice [post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/553185-visual-differences-between-different-screen-options-photos.html#post7132014) by mythlogic that shows the differences between the screens.

**Colour Calibration**

If you take colour calibration, the company you purchase from will use an external colour calibration device to calibrate your screen properly. I would not recommend that many people take this as a simple eye calibration is more than sufficient for most people, and people who need colour accuracy should ideally purchase their own calibration device since colour accuracy changes with room lighting etc...

**CPU**

Many people go for the largest number with CPUs. Don't.

A CPU performs millions of calculations per second and is the brain of your computer. Anyone doing large amounts of number crunching/calculations or people who are doing photo/video editing heavily should look for a powerful CPU, but games/everyday uses do not use the CPU heavily and most CPUs are sufficient for those purposes.

Ivy Bridge is the latest line of processors released by Intel. Ivy Bridge processors can be identified by the designation iY-3XXX(Q)M.

* The Y represents the lineup and can be either 3, 5 or 7. i7s are the premier CPUs, i5 the mainstream CPUs and i3 the budget CPUs.

* The “3” represents that a CPU is Ivy Bridge. If you see a “2”, it is an older Sandy Bridge processor that is running on older architecture (not the 22nm process in use right now).

* If the model number ends with only M (mobile), the CPU is a dual core model. If the model number ends in a QM (quad-core mobile), the CPU is a quad-core model. Quad-core models are much better for mutlitasking because you can have more threads running at once. All Intel iY models have hyperthreading, which means that each core can support 2 threads. This leaves the thread count on the i3s, i5s and i7 dual cores at 4 and the i7 quad cores at 8.

* [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/uoad8/i3_i5_i7_oh_my/c4x3mts) is a great explanation by LordAlfredo about the differences between the Intel CPU lineups.

I would recommend that most people buying Clevo models opt for the i7-3610QM. It is sufficiently powerful for gaming/heavy multitasking and a large upgrade over the i5s on offer. An i5 model will not however limit your gaming/everyday capabilities, but it may be slower for power users. A 3610QM will also have good futureproofing capabilities.

For power users (people looking to do calculations or photo/video editing) I would go with a i7-3720QM. It is the best CPU in terms of price efficiency. Any higher would be a waste of money.

**Thermal Compound**

Upgrading the thermal compound to the IC Diamond can lower the temperatures of your laptop by up to 5 degrees. The upgrade is however rather expensive at most vendors.

If you feel comfortable enough to open your laptop and do the pasting yourself, go for it! It'll be much cheaper than having the store do it for you. If not, well, then consider the upgrade.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1339108335.0,,,True,t3_up66m,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/up66m/clevo_guide_v20/,

I always see a lot of people looking for a durable, lightweight laptop to take to college or work with them with no intention of using it for gaming. Since it's a Thinkpad, you can probably assume that it'll be incredibly tough and reliable. 14"" 1920x1080 IPS display, 180 degree viewing angles. Touch is an option you can pick. Also comes with a ""power bridge battery"" that lets you swap batteries out without the laptop shutting down. From what I can tell, there's no price estimate out yet. One guy said the laptop will be selling around early-mid August, I believe. Could be sooner than that, though.

The [U430 Touch](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u430-touch/) (and the smaller version, the [U330 Touch](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u330-touch/)) would be great for someone that wants a lightweight laptop for school and light gaming. This is the laptop I'm personally excited for. I wanted a laptop that was under 5 lbs that had a long battery life, good screen, and lower range dedicated gpu for light gaming. The U430 Touch fulfills all of my requirements with it's 10 hour battery life, 1080p screen with touch, 4.17 lb weight (under 1 inch thick), and 2GB GT 730M. Looks like pricing starts at $899 for the U430 Touch and $799 for the U330 Touch. Release date is sometime this summer, before the end of August.

Be prepared to spend in the range of 1100-1400 for a gaming laptop. If you want a PC for around 700 dollars that will max out BF3, look at [r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc) . They can help you build your own desktop.

3.) LOOK AT OTHER POSTS. They often ask the same exact question. 

4.) Sorry for my rant, but it is frustrating. I really do want to help people who have special needs that aren't covered by the side bar. 

Personal suggestion: Spend a little extra on a laptop or you will be dissapointed. Also be 100% sure of your purchase. Most places will not return them unless they have a defect.

Mine got delivered earlier today and I thought I would give you guys some information. I think I'll do a Q and A next week after I have a chance to test out some of my games.

The model that I bought is the one listed on newegg.com. It shipped in 3 business days and I didn't have to go through the hassles of lenovo shipping. I used the code PCREFRESH13 and got it for $1050.

-The one on newegg is listed as having an 8GB caching ssd. This is incorrect, it actually has a 24GB ssd like the models listed on lenovo.com

-It does have dual 750m graphics cards in SLI

-The OS is not installed on the ssd.

-Even with almost no files installed on the ssd, the system is very responsive. The boot time is less than 20 seconds and it does not feel limited  by the 5400rpm 1TB hdd.

-I currently have 840GB free out of an 884GB usable. There are only 25GB in the folders visable when I open the C:// drive. The OS takes up 19GB and I suspect that there is also a hidden recovery partition. I have installed a few programs like steam and java, but I haven't started uninstalling the bloatware (there's quite a lot of it).

-Windows 8 feels very fast and I actually like it quite a lot. I have installed Start8 though, which is very nice.

-The track pad is *ok*. You can left click anywhere on its surface by either lightly tapping or pushing it down until it physically clicks. You right click by physcially pressing the bottom right area. It is definitely functional but I prefer to use my wireless mouse. There is a large deck area to the right of the track pad which is great for using a mouse if you don not have a desk. Cursor movement on the trackpad works well when I'm pulling my finger across it. It is difficult and there is lots of friction when pushing my finger, if you understand what I mean.

-When just web browsing the laptop temperatures are very cool and the fans are silent. It does get slightly warm, but it is not uncomfortable or unpleasent. I am using it on my lap right now with nothing between the laptop and my pants and I can barely feel the heat.

-the only game that I've had a chance to try so far is minecraft. When I start that, the fans get a bit loud but its easily drowned out by any audio. I don't know how warm it gets after more than half an hour of intensive use.

-The keyboard is fantastic. The backlight is not too bright. The right shift and backspace keys are a bit smaller than I'm used to, but I'm sure it will be easy to adjust to. The key sound is just right and the tactile feel/force required is also good. 

-The screen is very good. It is 1080x1920 and matte. The blacks are black and the colors are vibrant. The screen is also very bright. When used in front of the sun it does it hard to see, but not reflective. Text is crisp, but many webpages don't take up the entire screen and I have upped the zoom on some. Text is not to small to read.

-The laptop is much lighter than I expected. It's definitely portable and I can stand up, hold it with one hand underneath and type/move the mouse with the other hand very easily. As I said before, the area to the right of the trackpad is perfect for using a mouse on. The power brick, on the other hand, is huge. It weighs almost as much as the laptop does.

-Battery life is ok. It's almost out as I type this and I've been using it for the last two and a half hours on full brightness. Battery life while gaming is probably closer to an hour and a half but that is a guess.

I'll try to answer any other questions you guys might have but I can't say much as for performance yet.

Update: I tried out skyrim last night. SLI started up and both sides started blowing warm air, but it wasn't that hot. I was able to play on ultra high settings with very high framerates and loading screens of less than 20 seconds. I did not experience/notice any microstuttering. I'm going to see how it handles running hd textures. 

I think I might upgrade the msata 24GB ssd to a 256GB one and make that my boot drive, but know that this isn't a requirement and the laptop is extremely responsive anyway.

I bought it from Newegg and the first one came with a whacky keyboard that missed a lot of keystrokes. I sent back to Newegg and they sent me a new one. The new one immediately began to crack open. It sits on my desk so I barely ever open and close it, but the few times I did it began to crack at the hinges. This crack went completely up the screen, so I sent it back for repair. They had it for over a month and sent it back. Shortly after I started getting blue screens which increased with time until it was unusable. This lead to me sending it back again in which they kept it for over a month again and sent it back replacing the faulty memory. Turned it back on, got another blue screen. Sent it back and at that point realizing MSI had no customer support and Newegg washed their hands of it after the first return, I tried to file a claim with my credit card (at the time I had only had the computer in my possession for half the time I had owned it and it was 6 months down the road. The credit card (Discover) bitched out on me and even though I provided all emails, phone calls, pictures etc, they decided since it was after 30 days they could not do anything. So I waited, eventually got it back and today the screen is starting to come apart again, the dvd rom doesn't open (broken by the last ""repair"", and when I can get it open and a disc in it, it doesn't read it).

There is the [NP9130](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np9130-clevo-p151em1-p-4340.html) or the [NP9150](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np9150-clevo-p150em-p-4341.html) if you prefer a rubberized finish and a backlit keyboard with the option to upgrade to the ~30% faster 675M for another 100 bucks.

* i5 processor (able to bump this up to an i7)
* new GTX 670M GPU
* 8 gigs of DDR3
* wireless and bluetooth
* these are the only things that i care about so im not listing anymore

I was slightly on a budget, so I opted for the NP9130 (The 670M is more than enough for what I need it for, which is Diablo 3 for the rest of my life). But even so, the GPU is user upgradeable so if it starts dragging me down in the future I'll just replace it.

Total damage was something like $1134, no tax, free shipping from XoticPC. If you're a member of notebookreview or a student or military there's discounts for you. I am none of these things, so no discounts for me.

Customer service was nice.

Production took about a week. Shipping took 3 days. Once recieved I slapped my Solid 3 SSD in the caddy and left the stock 500gb inside and jammed Windows 7 on there via flash drive. I had to copy all the drivers from the DVD that came with the laptop to another flash drive to install them as Windows 7 didn't pick anything up automagically like it normally does.

Anyways with the system updated and drivers installed, here's my Windows index scores for your comparing pleasure:

Edit - Swapped my drives as the caddy is sata II. Primary Hard Disk jumped up to 7.6 from 7.4. Thanks guys, rookie mistake.

* Processor 7.6
* RAM 7.5
* Graphics 7.2
* Gaming Graphics 7.2
* Primary Hard Disk 7.6

Impressions:

This thing is the most nondescript laptop I have ever seen in my life. I chose the ""Remove all branding"" option, and seriously, there isn't a word on the thing. It's a decent sized ~6lb, completely matte black nondescript laptop. It looks like a movie prop. I like it.

Optimus switching seems to be nice, since I was dicking around on it for about 2 hours with wireless and bluetooth enabled updating and installing drivers, and seeing if my little Motorola bluetooth headset would pair up and work with Skype for voice communication for impending Diablo 3 (note: it does. Sweet.) and I only took it it down to 70%.

The screen is a very nice matte 1960x1080. I likes it. Alot. Having that resolution at 15.6 inches makes things look good. Even the character models in Diablo III (I kid, I kid)

Fans aren't loud. You can hear them but it doesn't sound like a jet is taking off like some laptops I have used. Haven't noticed it heating up terribly but I haven't really stressed it yet.

And in case you were wondering, Diablo III beta plays flawlessly at max settings. I know it's a pretty big deal.

Waiting for Ivy Bridge? Meh. Slightly increased processing power and lower power usage. Less overclock friendly. Probably good for laptops. Will I be doing anything in the next 3 years that I will rue the day I didn't wait for Ivy? No.

So there you go. For whoever cares. Like people who are constantly asking for a sweet gaming laptop around $1000 dollars.

Here are my thoughts.,32,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1alu95/just_bought_a_windows_8_laptop_its_seriously_not/,"This post is for those of you who are shopping for a new computer but are **unsure about Windows 8**, if you're in the market for a Windows PC. I'd like to share some quick thoughts on my new laptop purchase.

After doing some intense research on a few laptop brands (ASUS, Acer, Lenovo) and their respective models, I took the plunge and purchased the [ASUS VivoBook S400CA] (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230770&amp;Tpk=vivobook%20s400ca&amp;IsVirtualParent=1). Stories about how Windows 8 is just a step backwards in Microsoft's vision for its operating system needlessly narrowed my selection of laptops to choose from, since I basically looked at Win7 laptops only.



The only experience with Win8 that I had was at stores when I was playing around with touchscreen laptops. Only after a few minutes, the confusion with learning the new Metro interface turned into a smooth realization of the OS's intuitive, touch-oriented design. Despite my unease about learning a new OS, I was willing to give Win8 a try, even before I tested out the laptops. I even thought about downgrading to Win7, like others have done.

I found that to be unnecessary.

Windows 8's learning curve wasn't steep for me. Seriously, if you'd had experience with any tablet or touch-enabled mobile phone, the learning curve drops immediately. If you're testing it at a store and still frustrated with it, there are many options to [bring back or simulate that familiar Start button.](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/3-ways-to-tweak-windows-8-to-look-more-like-windows-7/)

One last thought: I want to preface this by saying that I don't work for Microsoft. I purchased the laptop at the Microsoft Store. I thought about buying it from Amazon or Newegg but noticed on the MS Store website that they have this service called Microsoft Signature, where they essentially provide computers without the bloatware that the manufacturers include. This is pretty convenient and saves the headache of being bombarded by needless junk.

Anyway, I hope this helps with your purchasing decisions. Thanks for reading!",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1alu95,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1alu95/just_bought_a_windows_8_laptop_its_seriously_not/,

Adding Valkyr comment:

We'll see the Clevo W230ST in a few weeks from XoticPC. Keep an eye on this page for updates, it'll be called some kind of Sager. I'm going to guess it'll be starting at ~$1400.

The Gigabyte P34G, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for if you're in the US. Gigabyte's previous laptops have been very scarce when it comes to US distribution, so even though they say August, it's unlikely we'll get it in the US then. Same goes for the Gigabyte P35K.

The Acer V7-482PG-9884-U will be an Acer.com exclusive, and should be available on this page, I'd guess, within a few weeks for $1299.

There's also the MSI GS70, for those looking for a larger screen, but thinner/lighter than most 17"" laptops. It's claimed to be 5.85 pounds, and 0.86"" thick.

1359872371.0,24,self.SuggestALaptop,17socl,"For those of you who are on the fence about getting a Lenovo Y580, do it.",27,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/17socl/for_those_of_you_who_are_on_the_fence_about/,"So I just got my Lenovo Y580 in the mail a couple days ago and wow, I am thoroughly impressed with this laptop. I bought a HP Envy 14 about 2 and a half years ago for college, but it started dying on me last year (random dead pixels, dead hard drive, dead ram, bad battery life, etc) It was about time that I got a new laptop.

From my research and the help of /r/SuggestALaptop, the Y580 was about the best laptop that I could get for what I needed. I wanted a laptop that was powerful enough to handle Solidworks and also be able to get good battery life and had decent build quality. I was thinking about getting a macbook pro, but I just couldn't get used to iOS, and the thought of being able to buy two laptops for a macbook just seemed silly to me.

The shipping only took about two weeks, which was pretty impressive for Lenovo. When I got it in the mail, the casing was much better than what I saw on youtube. It's not the blue tinted metal, but it's more of a black brushed aluminum casing on the outside. While the advertisement says that the keyboard area is plastic, it feels like it's made of metal, and it's a comfortable area for your palm to rest on.

The keyboard is absolutely wonderful. Having been typing on my old Envy 14 for the last two years, this keyboard has much more of a tactile feel to it, and has a very good response. There's a satisfactory ""click"" when you press down on the buttons, and the extended area on the bottom of the keys really helps your accuracy. The only thing that I would have liked to change is to have a larger backspace and shift key.

The sound quality is amazing as well. HP advertises their laptops with the ""beats"" brand, but their speakers are absolute garbage compared to the Y580. They're louder, sound better, and have a better range of sound. But the best part is when you plug in a good pair of headphones. I have a pair of Audio Technica M50s, and I have never heard music better than on this laptop. The soundstage, the accuracy of the sound is so much better than my old HP.

I also ordered this laptop with a 1080p display, and while it's not the best display on the market, it's still very good, especially for the price that you're paying. 

The battery life on this laptop is surprisingly good. I get on average of about 5 hours with my brightness set to a reasonable level.

The cooling system is also amazing. While the laptop is quite thick at 1.5 inches, it's because it has a huge copper heatsink and heatpipe. When I'm running intense programs, I never hear the fan whine. 

Now, there are some things that I am not too keen on. While it is a powerhouse of a laptop, it's still a little bit heavy to lug around in my backpack, especially with the charger. It also doesn't feel as sturdy as other laptops. There's visible flex around the palm rest area, and the keyboard has quite a lot of flex all over it. The plastic insert where the keyboard is also is not flush to the system either.

A lot of people have been complaining about the touchpad, but I really don't think it's that bad. I've been using it for about a week, and I haven't had any real problems with it.

When I ordered this laptop, I wanted to take out the hard drive and install my own SSD into it and install windows 7. The problem with this is that you have to change some of the security options in the BIOS due to windows 8 having been installed in the computer beforehand. Once you change these settings, however, you have to manually install the drivers for windows 7. This can be kind of annoying, especially since there is a specific order for installation, and some of the drivers provided on Lenovo's website don't work.

So in conclusion, there are some faults to the y580, but for the price, performance, and overall design, I would definitely buy it again. Hope this helped a little bit.

I've been browsing this subreddit a great deal and you've pointed me in the direction of so many laptops that I know whichever one I pick, my choices are now much more informed. Additionally, now I think I'm ready to fully explain what I want. The dog metaphor is seriously a great TL;DR for what I want out of my laptop.

I'm a doctoral student in experimental psychology. I need this laptop to do work comfortably. The main programs it will be using are Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, R statisics program, and the Matlab statistics program. I need to be able to type easily and run analyses easily. If possible, I'd like it to be able to handle running Matlab analyses and still have enough memory available to go read an article or type on MS word.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**
 
* Country of purchase: United States
 
* Budget range: 1000-1500 at the most.
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Ultraportable. I don't have a car so I walk to work. In addition, my office is in one building but I teach classes elsewhere so I need the laptop to fit in my briefcase comfortably and not be too heavy. 
 
* Screen size preference: 12-14 inches. Smaller is inconvenient and larger would start getting too bulky.
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Very very minimal. All I want is a laptop to watch netflix on and maybe do some casual gaming like Plants vs. Zombies.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): None to my knowledge.
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): College IT guy who works for the department.
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): None really other than a preference for windows. Other than that, I just want the laptop that works. 
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): The only style I care a great deal about relates to pragmatics. I want the laptop to work well. I want the keys to be well spaced out and easy to type. I know a number of Lenovo's laptops do this very well with their concaved buttons. I also want the laptop to be sturdy and reliably resilient. One thing that is keeping me from the Sony Vaio pro 13 is that it flexes, which could cause damage over time. Also, the fan sounds like it has a difficult time keeping it from overheating. So keep those stylistic preferences in mind.
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Balanced.
 
* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality all the way.
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced
 
**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

For these, I will give you guys a 0-100 rating. 
0 = Don't care about this at all. 
50 = Don't want to skimp out on it, but I will definitely not be paying premium for this. 
100 = Shut up and take my money because this is very important to me. 

* High resolution screen: 50
 
* A great keyboard: 90

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) I'd like at least one USB 3.0 and an HDMI out port. 

Final note, I am incredibly open to suggestions.

1361412923.0,19,self.SuggestALaptop,18xedl,New Samsung Series 7 Chronos has started trickling out in the US,20,1,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18xedl/new_samsung_series_7_chronos_has_started/,"This just in...one of the models of the new Samsung Series 7 Chronos started arriving at Best Buy stores on February 17th. This one has the Radeon 8770 GPU instead of the much touted Radeon 8870 GPU, so performance will be similar to an nVidia GT650M.  It looks like a pretty decent unit, though I haven't had a chance to pick one up yet.

It has a quad core i7 3635QM CPU, 8 GB of RAM (4GB soldered in, from what I hear, allowing a max of 12GB), a 1920x1080 touch screen, the 8770 GPU with 1GB of video memory, and a 1TB 5400 RPM hard disk with no ""Expresscache""/SSD caching.  Battery life is being reported by the few who have picked them up to be a little over 6 hours.

The Samsung model number is NP780Z5E-S01UB, and the UB indicates a US model that is BestBuy exclusive.  Right now they have it at $1199 in certain stores, but I have yet to be able to find it on their web site at all.  Nonetheless, people are buying them in stores and I've seen a couple of unboxing videos and pics already.  The BestBuy SKU is supposed to be BB13706062, so in theory you could call around and see who has them in stock.  There should be an NP780Z5E-S01US which may well be identical in most (or all) ways, and I'd expect to see it showing up shortly at other retailers.

There is also supposed to be an NP780Z5E-S02 (US or UB?  Both?) model that will be coming in the future with 16GB of RAM and the AMD Radeon 8870 2GB GPU that was shown at CES.  It is rumored to cost $1699.  The 8870 GPU in this one is claimed (by AMD) to be about 70% faster than the nVidia GT650M.  I've heard others say more like 40% faster, but either way that is pretty impressive.  Other differences is that the S02 model is stated to have 11 hours of battery, the S01 at around 8.  Take those numbers with a grain of salt, but I'd call either of them quite good for the amount of power they're packing.

These S02 models haven't been seen in the wild yet, and unfortunately the rumor mills don't have a release date.  What I have heard from the rumor mill is that it would be released in April in Canada, and also in Belarus.  I have no reason to think that the US release would be any later than that, if not possibly a little sooner.  Still, I'm guessing you've got over a month to go.

FWIW, the model available now can be opened and have the 1TB drive replaces with an SSD.  I'm told that a 9mm drive will fit.  If you figure $220 or less for a 256GB Samsung 840 SSD and and 8GB memory module, you'll be at around $1400 for a device that will be competitive with the ""cheapest"" $1900 Asus UX51vz, with arguably better build quality.

TBH, I'm torn on whether to jump on this one, wait for the non-BestBuy exclusive model, or wait for the S02 model altogether, but it looks like there's another great option out there today.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_18xedl,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18xedl/new_samsung_series_7_chronos_has_started/,

Thanks in advance!

I've been researching laptops for a while, and boy is there a lot of stuff out there! Does anyone know of a good touchscreen laptop that could run most modern games? I don't need a powerhouse that'll run Crysis 2 at top settings or anything, I'm mostly interested in playing stuff like modded Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, maybe Starcraft 2. 

I'm interested in the touchscreen because I rather enjoy windows 8 and want to use it the way it's meant to be used, and a hear RTS' are pretty fun to play with one. 

I was originally hoping for something around $600, but I'm starting to realize that a semi-decent gaming laptop with a touchscreen at that price might be a little unrealistic. So I am willing to save a bit more if that price area in impossible, but something near that would be great. 


Other info: A screen size between 13-15"" would be cool, willing to go a bit smaller. I'm okay with most brands, though I prefer Toshiba and ASUS. Battery life isn't a huge concern, but something that'll last me a day of classes at school (4-5 hours?) would be awesome. 

Thanks a bunch in advance!

Hey, guys.  I'm here for you to help me if you can!  So far, I've customized a PowerPro R 11:36-675 with an i7 3630QM (2.4GHz), a GTX 675MX, 16GB 1600Hz DDR3, IC Diamond thermal paste, a 750GB 7200rpm HDD, DVDRW/CDRW drive, Bigfoot 1202 wireless card, no OS (free windows through my school), and a 3 year warranty for $1493 and plan to add a Samsung 840 250GB SSD after I get some more money for $180.  Or, also through PowerNotebook, a Sager NP9150 with a 95% color gamut matte screen, an AMD HD 7970M, same processor, IC Diamond thermal paste, 16GB 1600MHz DDR3 again, same type of HDD and a HDD bay instead of an optical drive (Anyone know if I can get a SATA III up in this bitch?), same Wireless card (or an integrated Intel card for $50 less; I'm not sure the performance advantage since my internet isn't pushing Wireless-N boundaries), no OS, and a 1-year warranty for $1614.08.  Please keep in mind both of those prices are just the regular-degular price, menos a 3% cash discount.  I've heard you can get a discount through them if you use NotebookReviews forum, but don't know anything past that ""you can.""  The same laptop (Or, well, the P150EM) through Mythlogic with 8GB 1866MHz DDR3, a free Cooler Master NotePal Notebook Cooling Stand, a glossy Pollux Display (no 95% color gamut), and another 3 year warranty is $1703.72 with 3% cash discount.  Again, no idea how to get their NBR forum discount.  I like the idea of the Phoenix plan and would like to know more, but it's hard to decide if it's worth a $200 price jump and a glossy screen.  More on my thoughts of Mythlogic later.

Also, keep in mind that I'm a student and, if they have stackable student discounts, I would love to use that in conjunction with the cash discount.  Another point to consider is that it may be a while before I buy this laptop, so if you have any suggestions that come out soon-ish (I could even wait until September if it means a great deal), then just let me know!

I like both the GTX 675MX and the 7970M, so if you'd like to look into a laptop for me (thank you!), then remember that as well!  :)

* Country of purchase: USA
 
* Budget range: $1250-$1750 (I’d really prefer to keep it around $1500 if I can)
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming/Desktop replacement
 
* Screen size preference: 15.6”
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): BF3, Torchlight 2, Path of Exile, etc.  I’d like high FPS, and the higher the settings the better (though I don’t mind turning down things that hit it hard, like AA, for smooth gameplay).  I’m planning on starting to record games with FRAPS more often, so the FPS is probably going to take a hit anyways.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): A little bit of video/audio editing, but I don’t do much with effects and everything because the video isn’t live action for the most part.  But, 1080p video editing would be nice.  I’m doing 720p right now and using Intel HD 3000 graphics on this laptop.
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): self-support for most things, but if I got really desperate and Google was barren, I would only hate myself a little for contacting the manufacturer/reseller
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): I like ASUS, but it seems like Sager and PowerPro are going to be my best options for laptops considering the price premium with ASUS.
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I really like the brushed aluminum look and the keyboards with customizable lighting, but I’m honestly not really into flashy stuff enough to pay extra for it.  The laptops I’ve been looking at/customizing have been the PowerPro R 11:36-675 and the Sager P150/P150EM (customized through PowerNotebooks and Mythlogic, though I have only been looking at Mythlogic because it seems like there’s bitchin’ quality-control and customer support with the Phoenix program really appealing to me).
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Balanced.  I’m pretty indifferent about this one since I know I’m not going to get it in a high-end gaming laptop and, if I do, it’s going to be what I’m paying for instead of performance.
 
* Build quality -vs- Low price: Balanced.  I don’t want my laptop to shit out for a good 3 years or more, but I would like to keep the price low without sacrificing quality too much.
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced.  Man, I bet you guys like seeing that for all three.  I’m willing to pay extra to put the better thermal paste on (I’m not comfortable putting it on myself, though adding a SATA III SSD is on my to-do list after I get it.  Speaking of which, what is your guys’ recommended SSD?  I’ve been looking at the Samsung 840 series 250GB.), but I don’t want to sacrifice a high-end card for a 660m just to keep it cool.  A cooling pad is also on my to-buy list.  If I am on-the-go and can’t bring the pad, I’ll just turn down settings.
 
**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
 
* High resolution screen: Within reason.  I’m all about dat 1080p lyfe
 
* A great keyboard: Not particularly.
 
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Nope, nope, nope.  I use an external mouse 90% of the time.
 
* Great audio: Not super important since I usually have TurtleBeach X12s hooked up (not great, but I got ‘em for $35 and that was a pretty good price for what they are), so if it has it, great, if not, oh well.  I have been looking at USB DACs/Amps lately, though, and suggestions on that would be appreciated as well.
 
**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

1080p is a must, matte screen is very much preferred (though I don’t want to spend $100 over my budget to get it, either.  How is a glossy screen for indoors use?), I’d like USB 3.0, and slots for a 2.5” HDD (preferably a 750gb 7200rpm one, though 500gb wouldn’t be unbearable since I have a large external ;) ) and a SATA III SSD is important.

This isn't a laptop for gaming or stuff like 3d modeling, but if you need a solid ultrabook for work/school I think that the X1C has to be on your list of contenders. 

Pros: 

* Under 3 lbs
* Very sturdy with great build quality.
* Very quiet like a ninja.
* Looks really smooth. Solid black all over. The official Batman laptop.
* Unbelievably comfortable keyboard. Could type all day on it.
* Extremely slick and responsive trackpad
* Also has the mouse nub if you're into those
* Charges faster than anything I've ever seen before
* Matte screen (pro for fiancee, maybe some don't like it though) with good brightness at max level.
* Backlit keyboard
* 1600x900 resolution
* Lenovo is an unbelievable company. Contacted and got a personal response from one of their executives due to problems with order. Also their warranty support for the Thinkpad line is US based and gives you the rockstar treatment if you ever need service.
* If you look around you can get a great deal on them. Mine has better specs and a better warranty than a MBA *AND* it was cheaper.

Cons:

* Gets quite warm on the bottom if you're doing anything other than word processing/web browsing
* Ports are a little skimpy. Only 2 USB; Ethernet takes up 1 of the 2. Mini display port only. It does have a sd card slot and a sim card slot though.
* Speakers/webcam are both just average.
* Picks up fingerprints
* Only 5 hour battery life, even less if running something like a full screen streaming video. This isn't the hugest deal though since it charges incredibly quickly.
* Don't even think about playing most games made within the last 5 years other than on ultra low settings. 
* Doesn't do dishes or dispense $100 bills


**Edit**: I actually think MBAs are great laptops in spite of my title in jest. They're definitely a serious contender in this ultrabook category as well.

What should I get?,19,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/xg5vy/college_student_2500_to_spend_via_scholarship/,"EDIT: I just saw this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/wfcrk/us_larger_budget_2500_college_student_nongamer/) and it seems like they recommended the ThinkPad W530. Thoughts?

-----------

Well as the title says my university is allowing me to get a laptop + printer upto $2500 - whatever's left after buying this is gone.. In this case what should I get? I'm guessing $200 would be enough for an ok printer, so I guess I actually have $2300...

I value portability (i.e. weighs less) as much as usability. I've been eyeing the Samsung Series 9 but am open to options! I guess I'm looking for a fully decked out ultrabook in a sense...

I originally posted this on r/applehelp as I was considering macbooks (the air), but with the software I may need in the future only running on windows it might just be better to go for a PC... I heard running windows on a macbook kills the battery life. Thoughts?

(This is a throwaway as I'm a bit concerned that this info can give away my privacy)

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: Up to 2500 (but not strictly) - see above though

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): surfing, portable, multi-tasking (i.e. writing essays), some light gaming, data-analysis/programming software

* Screen size preference: larger than a typical netbook

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): no Linux, Windows preferred, but Mac is ok

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): enough so that I can watch HD videos without stutter

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): there's an apple store nearby, student techs on campus

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): none - just eyeing the MBP/MBA since a lot of students seem to use these and are happy with them (even if they are ""overpriced"" considering my situation where anything less of $2500 is just wasted, I don't think this matters much)

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): the MBA

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: low weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price: build quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: high performance that will last long (which I guess means low heat as well..)

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen:

* A great keyboard: yes

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: yes

* Great audio:

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1343745226.0,,,True,t3_xg5vy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/xg5vy/college_student_2500_to_spend_via_scholarship/,
1337873169.0,19,self.SuggestALaptop,u2v06,My experiences so far with my Sager 9130 and XoticPC,19,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/u2v06/my_experiences_so_far_with_my_sager_9130_and/,"I got my laptop about 2 weeks ago, the design is beautiful, all branding removed (except, for whatever reason, the ""Onkyo Speakers"" brand).  The screen is amazing, I got the 1920x1080 95% gamut matte screen, and it's better than I thought it would be.  

Most programs run well like Dota 2, Portal 2, etc.  Diablo 3 has trouble, but I'm under the impression that it's an  Nvidia problem or something with D3 Specifically, the specs should be more than enough for it. 

One design flaw that drives me insane is with the function keys.  The F5 and F6 keys are the function+volume up/down keys.  Now, for whatever reason, some jackass decided it would be a good idea to put the function+mute key on F3 and the function+sleep key on F4.  I have no idea how anyone would decide this was a good idea but it causes some unwanted sleep modes and drives me insane. Sometimes when the computer wakes up from sleep/hibernation, the fan runs at 100% and will not stop until I reboot it.

I've also had a problem with the right speaker buzzing with the volume around 70% or higher, sometimes lower, depending on what I'm doing.  It sounds like something is loose within the machine so I need to RMA it, which brings me to my next point.

I ordered the device from XoticPC.  Their customer service for purchasing the product was fantastic.  Fast responses, very helpful advice, answered all of my questions.  However, I have been trying to get an RMA set up for 11 days now and am lucky to get 1 response a day from the service/support team from XoticPC.  I realize that they have to relay information to Sager, but an RMA for a defective laptop should not take 11 days to simply get a shipping label for an RMA.  Overall, this experience has me on the verge of returning it entirely and purchasing from another company/manufacturer.

1374270882.0,15,self.SuggestALaptop,1inrg1,(Warning: Length) [Recommendation/User Review/AMA] Samsung Series 7 Chronos NP780Z5E/ATIV Book 8 [$1000-$1300US],19,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1inrg1/warning_length_recommendationuser_reviewama/,"I've owned the last model of this laptop that was still called a Series 7 Chronos for 3 weeks, and it is almost identical to the re-branded ATIV Book 8. I scoped it out extensively before buying and thought it looked perfect for my needs, and I still haven't found much bad to say about it. It has the form factor and battery life of an ultrabook and the power of a decent gaming rig. It had some particularly annoying out-of-the-box setup issues compared to your usual bloatware, but I've spent a lot of time with it and have finally got everything setup the way I like it, so I can give it a complete review. I was lucky enough to find it for exactly $1000US on ebay, but even if you have to spend a bit more to install an SSD, it is still a good deal.


**Hardware and Performance**


- i7-3635QM, 8770M, 8GB 1600 MHz, 1 TB 5400 RPM HDD


- WEI:
   - Processor: 7.8
   - RAM: 7.8
   - Graphics: 6.7
   - Gaming Graphics: 6.7
   - Primary hard disk: 5.9


I don't play a lot of really demanding games, but these three were done with AMD 13.6 Beta 2 drivers. Stock drivers were generally 5-10 frames lower.

- Guild Wars 2:
   - [Settings](http://i.imgur.com/1Z6cFl8.jpg) - 30-35fps
- Arkham City:
   - [Settings](http://i.imgur.com/1eEJVST.png) - 30-35fps
- Battlefield 3 singleplayer:
   - 1080p, high settings (averaged), no ambient occlusion, low AA/AF - 30-45fps


The slow 1 TB drive is probably the biggest deal-breaker people would have with this laptop, and it is a little slow as you would think. However, there are some things that make it seem worse than it actually is (see tweaks below). Here are the boot times I measured earlier:

- Cold boot to login screen: 12 sec
- Restart from login screen to login screen: 42 sec
- Wake from sleep: 2 sec
- Login screen to desktop: 10 sec

I'm not too bothered by boot times, but the most significant issue was the initialization delay *after* getting to the desktop. You can do away with a lot of it with some tweaks, but even then your desktop won't be very responsive for 10-15 seconds after first getting there, as Windows eats 100% of your HDD for a few seconds. Using sleep mode instead of shut down as often as possible is strongly suggested anyway, but it's mostly going to be frustrating when you're setting up your laptop for the first time and configuring lots of software and updates. I hardly notice it now that I'm all done with that.


I've also heard the HDD bay is smaller than usual, and won't fit all HDD/SSD models. I will open up my case and take a look at it soon.


**Heat Management**


- Idles around 45-47C in lousy air-conditioning
- Peaks at 78-80C in most games without a cooling pad
- Maximum so far has been 82-84C (BF3) after long use
- Cools down from peak to idle temps in just a couple of minutes


The internal design directs heat to the strip between the keyboard and the screen, so there's no temp changes on the palm rests or the keyboard. The bottom does get somewhat warm if you're using it on your lap, but isn't so uncomfortable that I won't put it there. But then I'm coming from an HP Pavilion that topped out at 107C and would have given me serious leg burns had I used it that way.


**Chassis, Design, and Build Quality**


The bottom is a single plastic cover, everything else is brushed aluminum. It's very fingerprint-resistant, and it's hard to notice and very easy to clean the ones you do get. The chassis has almost no flex, but the screen has a fair bit. The hinge runs along the entire back side, and is very sturdy for typical use compared to the 2-small-hinge design I had last, but does have a little wobble when using the touch screen.


Some people say the bottom is hard to remove - but all that's really different is a few clips on the inside edges that you have to pop open after the screws. The entire bottom plate comes off, so you have access to everything. There's also a RAM cover that you can take off separately to upgrade 1 of the 2 memory slots.


The laptop is very portable at 0.9"" thick, 5.5 lbs - my HP was 8 lbs :(. The ports are placed sensibly towards the back and mostly on the left, so stuff isn't in the way when you use a right-handed mouse, but would be a little less convenient for southpaws.


**Display**


The 1080p sreen is often reported as a TN panel, but actually seems to be an MVA panel made by AUO, sort of a cross between TN and IPS (or could just be a very high end TN, nothing like the last TN I used whatsoever). The reported downsides of an MVA are that it can be grainier and prone to ghosting. I can see the grainy quality a little bit on a white background, but not really anywhere else, and it's no different from the TN panel I had last - but I've never had an IPS screen laptop to compare. I also haven't experienced any ghosting on this unit, so it might only appear on a bad unit or after an unrealistically long time. The glass touchscreen cover is very easy to wipe clean with any sort of fabric.


Some reviews have said it doesn't live up to the promised 300 nits brightness, but it is either very close, or has some variation between units. It is also advertised as anti-glare in some places, but mine is either fully glossy or semi-glossy, because there is still a fair amount of reflection on low brightness. However, the screen gets bright enough that I don't notice it indoors and can still use it comfortably in direct sunlight.


The viewing angles are terrific - there is no color inversion or distortion of any kind at any angle, horizontally or vertically. It also has great blacks, contrast, and color spectrum coverage - reviews have it put right next to the rMBP. There are also several color mode presets from Samsung.


**Keyboard and Touchpad**

There is no separate back-plate behind the keyboard for internal access, so the keys are set right into the metal chassis - meaning the keyboard is very sturdy and has absolutely no flex. The keys are very quiet and soft feeling compared to others. I guess other people like clicky keys with more resistance when you type, but I definitely prefer it this way. It also has 4 levels of backlight brightness, and the labels on the keys are transparent, so the light is not just around the edges. There are no obnoxiously sized keys, though the numpad keys are smaller than the letter keys.


The touchpad is huge, very accurate, and has tons of gestures compared to my last laptop, with up to 4 finger support. The touchpad never spazzes out or does any unintended gestures. There are no dedicated buttons - the entire pad is a clickpad. Clicking the bottom right corner is supposed to right-click, which works fine in the OS, but doesn't work too well in certain applications. Thankfully the touchpad software lets you assign right-click to a different behavior, so it isn't a problem and is actually easier. Besides the normal stuff, here's what you can do:

- Right click with 2 finger tap or click
- Middle mouse click with 2 finger tap
- Forward/backward 3 finger side-swipes
- Open up Computer/File explorer with 3 finger up-swipe
- Alt+tab with 3 finger down-swipe
- Return to/toggle Desktop with 4 finger up-swipe

You can also pick from 3 different settings on how to drag&amp;drop - release on finger lift, release after delay, or release on click.


**Battery and Power**


The battery is 91Wh and cannot be removed. This is really unfortunate for people who list it as a deal-breaker, but shouldn't be a problem for most people, as the battery life is fantastic. Samsung is one of the few who offer a battery-saving feature that stops charging after a certain %, which can be toggled on and off. The power adapter is 90W, so it's nice and small for carrying around, and the power draw has never exceeded 90W and throttled the system under heavy use.


On low brightness while browsing, reading/writing documents, and other misc light tasks, I get about 10-12 hours. Doing similar things but on medium brightness, I still get 8-10 hours. On low brightness with browsing and running analysis code in MATLAB for long periods of time, I get about 4-6 hours. I haven't tried anything with wi-fi turned off, but one review marked it at almost 16 hours.


**Audio**


The JBL speaker systems are great and were the most surprising thing about this laptop for me. My previous HP had Beats audio with a subwoofer, and JBL makes Beats have 0 bass by comparison - you can really feel music if you play it in your lap. Samsung's software has 12 music/environment audio presets and advanced settings in addition to the standard Realtek software, which are surprisingly effective. Its own speakers don't get incredibly loud without headphones, but I also didn't notice any distortion at max volume.


**Wireless**


The network card is a dual channel, a/b/g/n + Bluetooth 4.0 Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235, which has some pretty nice features; however, connection settings were a bit shaky on defaults. Most of these have been cleared up (see tweaks below) for home use, but I haven't had any chance to test it out in a crowded place.


**Software, System Tweaks**


If you decide to get one, this is a list of most of the quirks and changes I've made or have heard about that you should do straight away to save yourself some time.


- Before all else, get rid of IntelliMemory. It's some attempt at RAM disk functionality that comes pre-installed, but it's a pile of crap. It's constantly configuring itself, and incurs 100% disk usage and high cpu usage for long periods of time. It will make your computer completely unusable after boots for several minutes, and will frequently bog you down after that, regardless of how long you leave the OS running. If you find a really bad review of this Samsung's performance, chances are it was some poor soul who didn't know to get rid of this bloatware.


- Do not uninstall Samsung's Settings.exe. It is critical for controlling some of the display, keyboard, audio, and power features, and you can only get some control back without it afaik.


- If you want to uninstall SWUpdate, keep its installation files offline somewhere. You'll need it if you do any sort of recovery/drive wiping, as Samsung's pre-installed drivers and settings are a bit different than most manufacturers.


- Install the BIOS update through SWUpdate, but (apparently) do not install the update to the Elan touchpad drivers. I've read they remove some of the functionality of the touchpad, and I haven't had any issues with the earlier version anyway.


- To improve wireless connectivity, download the update through SWUpdate, and disable Bluetooth and/or N-mode if you won't be using one and/or the other. Bluetooth was the bigger culprit for me, and it's easily toggled in the Settings if you want to use it periodically. I've also seen it recommended that you get a link to install Intel's wireless drivers without the software component, but I didn't need to try it.


- Some (particularly older models) Samsung laptops have been bricked by trying to install a Linux distro, due to a bug in the UEFI implementation. The main bug seems to be gone according to [this post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/713184-2013-series-7-chronos-ativ-book-8-15-owners-lounge-np770z5e-np780z5e-np870z5e-np880z5e-7.html#post9140204) in the newer models, but make sure you proceed with caution - there's a lot of good info in that post, [this post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/706510-samsung-laptops-bricked-using-uefi.html), and [this post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/702308-introducing-2013-series-7-chronos-amd-hd8870m.html), but I haven't tried it yet. You'll at least have to disable Fast BIOS, SecureBoot, and set the sub option to CSM+UEFI to be able to boot from a USB.


- The stock AMD drivers are something like version 9.3. They are upgradable, but don't try to do it the normal way by uninstalling the old ones first - just install 13.6 Mobility or whatever is current right on top of the stock drivers. UnifL switchable drivers work but aren't necessary, and they kill your brightness control and Sleep mode. Brightness control is recoverable, Sleep mode isn't.


- Disable automatic adjustment of the keyboard backlight and screen (""Enable adaptive brightness"" in the display section of advanced power profile settings). It works fairly well, but some conditions will make it go back and forth between brightness levels if you move your head slightly - and more importantly, it limits the maximum brightness setting if you want to adjust it yourself temporarily. Turning this off doesn't stop if from dimming due to non-use.


- I've had AMD switchable graphics before, but the version of it on the Samsung is completely different. The transition is seamless (no black screen/flickering while it changes cards) and is application-dependent. CCC does a pretty good job of detecting what applications should use the AMD card, but you might have to set a few obscure things manually. It allows you to set always AMD, always Intel, or battery-dependent for any .exe, and it seems to work great.

What's even better is this new version of the BIOS comes the key ability to overclock the vBIOS as well.

(xpost /r/chromeos)",17,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1hp7li/samsung_series_3_chromebook_the_first_12_hours_or/,"Hi, I noticed a lot of people looking for cheap, simple laptops that get the basics done.  /r/SuggestALaptop has helped me in the past, so I wanted to give back a little.  I just picked up a Series 3 Chromebook, and I wanted to share my thoughts with yall. 

-----

So my Samsung Series 3 Chromebook arrived today, and I've had a chance to use it all day now.  After a week of poring over reviews, making the impulse buy, and the long wait for delivery overseas, it's finally in my hands.  


Opening up the box, it was... Well, it is what it is--a small and light Samsung notebook, of which there are many here in Korea.  The weight and dimensions are nice.  It weighs only a little more than my iPad 4 with a Belkin keyboard cover, but of course with a much more generous keyboard with a trackpad. The little Chrome logo is a delight, however.  And I appreciate the small and light PSU. 

Upon booting up, I was **delighted by the quality of the screen**.  It was always harped on--any review I read, screen quality was always in the 'con' column.  But here's the thing: I bet none of them ever used a Thinkpad T420 with a 1600x900 AUO panel.  HANDS DOWN WORST DISPLAY EVER.  So to have a small and sharp, acceptably bright matte display with viewing angles that are actually in the obtuse range?  Heaven.  Having such low expectations for what a 'bad display' is, I was pleasantly surprised that the SS3's panel was more than acceptable. 

After the first few boots and updates, I started downloading apps and signing into all of my sites.  And I started browsing and browsing.  Youtube videos, some Netflix streaming, Spotify, fell down a few Wikipedia rabbit holes.  And it was all... Fine. **It was as it should be.** A little stuttery while scrolling certain sites (like The Verge), certain streaming video sites are a little rough.  But my whole thing was: if this Chromebook performed worse than a tablet as a browser, it was getting sent back.  And it's a keeper. It's not going anywhere. 

I'm a tabber--I can have up to 50 tabs open at any given time--and while I don't expect the SS3 to be able to keep up with that (my i5 laptop and my gaming desktop sometimes struggle to keep up), it puts up a good fight with 10-20 tabs open. Sunspider and other browser tests will often benchmark this against tablets--usually with scores twice as high--and I can confidently say that as a browsing machine, it completely destroys the best tablets on the market.  Nothing is more infuriating than to return to a tab, only to have it need to reload again. 

The keyboard is pretty good.  It's on par with my Asus N56, which is to say that it's in the upper echelon of Windows laptop keyboards.  The best laptop keyboards I've ever used were on Thinkpads and mid-to-late G4 Powerbooks. This isn't up there with them, but it's infinitely better than most other Samsung budget keyboards, and is more than acceptable. It's a solid above average, a B+ in a category that usually strives for mediocre. 

Battery life seems to be pretty damned decent so far.  I've been running it on battery power from 100% for 2.5 hours, with two hours of suspension and one reboot.  Brightness has been at about 60-80%.  I've watched a couple of episodes of QI on YouTube and put together a few playlists on Spotify.  I've had no less than 10 tabs open at any given time, and I have had a VPN running for about 30 minutes.  With all that, I'm at 56%, with a stated remaining runtime of 3h52.  Pretty happy with that. If I can get a solid 5 hours of 10+ tabs, video and music streaming, with decent standby time... Well, can't ask for more than that! My old Asus 1015PEM wouldn't go more than 3 hours, and that's if I was being judicious about my energy usage.  With the Chromebook, I don't feel any anxiety in having to monitor my battery levels.

**Edit: I let the battery run down to 8%. I ended up getting battery life (screen on) just shy of five hours with the conditions above, including a little remote desktop video streaming, and torrent downloading.**

-------
My few complaints with the hardware include:
 
-Trackpad.  Very decent, especially compared to a lot of budget Windows laptops.  ~~But I miss the ability to tap and drag.~~ **(THANK YOU /u/meatwaddancin)**  Also, three button tap is more miss than hit.  Not a failure by any means but as ChromeOS matures, I hope the trackpad abilities follow suit.

-There's a creaky bit right under my right palm.  It's a bit annoying, since it's actually kind of loud.  It sounds like someone popping their knuckles.  **EDIT: I tightened the screw under the right palmrest, and it's helped a lot! It's still a little squeaky, but it doesn't make the loud clicking noise it used to.**

-VPN support.  For some reason, using L2TP over IPsec with PSK is nearly unusable.  I might have to fiddle with my settings a bit more, but using the same VPN on my iPhone or Gnex is a better experience. 

-Speakers. Eh, I've got nice headphones. 

-----

A couple of nice surprises:

-Love, love, love the giant ctrl and alt keys. Brilliant. 

-Dedicated function keys.  No more having to hit Fn. 

------

I'm a bit of a gadget hoarder, and completely OS agnostic.  I have a Gnex, iPhone 5, and Lumia 920, and Motorola Defy, all of which have their uses in my life. My main rig at home is a mid-range gaming desktop.  I have an Asus N56 at work, and use a 2006 Macbook as my browsing machine. iPad 4 and Galaxy Note 10.1.  Oh, and an old rooted Nook Color that I use as a desk clock. 

I'm looking to simplify my digital life.  This Chromebook does a great job where so many other devices were ridden with compromise.  My other choice was the Asus Transformer Infinity TF700t--beautiful screen, but subpar typing and trackpad experience, and mobile OS browsers simply can't keep up. Could I have gone for an 11"" Macbook Air or Vaio Pro?  Not really. A lot of my job is in the field, so I don't want something I have to babysit.  The seconds I save by being able to slam the lid shut, throw it in my bag and be on my way, the happier I am.  *I love this Chromebook because it feels less like a possession and more like a tool.*  $250 isn't pocket change, but if I have to buy another one for some reason, I won't have trouble making rent next month. 

I can safely say that the SS3 replaces the Macbook, Galaxy Note 10.1, and the iPad 4 in terms of my mobile work and couch potato needs.  They're all going on Craigslist or being gifted this week. Having multiple jobs (I work as a chef, television and radio host) I'm often on the road all day, having to write and edit scripts, menus, and email on the fly.  I can't wait to throw a SIM in here to see what it's like to be out in the field and being able to do research. 

**ETA: /u/meatwaddancin pointed out that tap and drag is available under accessibility settings**

**TL;DR - IF you're looking for something solely for web browsing and note taking, AND you have a secondary full-featured laptop or desktop, forgo expensive tablets and go for the Samsung Series 3 Chromebook. It's a great choice if you keep in mind that it is a tool, not a toolbox.**",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1373081027.0,,,True,t3_1hp7li,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1hp7li/samsung_series_3_chromebook_the_first_12_hours_or/,

Recovering Mac User.",17,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/12n1c6/looking_for_two_laptops_one_for_absolute/,"When I went off to college 5 years ago I had just scrapped a cumbersome hp laptop for a macbook. I did some light gaming, and my theory was that apple's disabilities in the game-running department would keep me studious (and it sort of worked). Also, I liked apple aesthetically (I previously ran Linux on my old machine after becoming fedup with windows clutter to get that minimalist feel.).

Now the old laptop is dying and I find that I've tried to do some gaming on it, though could never get the games I wanted for obvious reasons (it being too weak to dualboot well).

I want to completely separate my life into two machines to keep myself productive but not to severely limit myself (I work well when I have work-only spaces).

Laptop 1: Work:
Needs to be extraordinarily cheap and have a minimalist feel to it. My work and future schooling only requires text editing. I travel while I work, so something small, sleek, and with a long battery life would be ideal.
I was thinking of getting a chromebook for this. The cheapest samsung one (the 250$). Does the starting level one do google docs offline effectively? (or do you need the new 550?) I read something about not being able to start new documents offline.... Anyone have any experience?

Computer 2: Luxury:
I'm going to want to have fun on the computer and I prefer segmenting it off into a different place. This can afford to be clunkier. I would like it able to play something like Skyrim well, but nothing amazing. Also for storing music, dubiously obtained files, other software, and all that jazz. Something I could come back home to while I travel.

I'll try one of those forms for it:

I've used it for various things, but mostly music, browsing, and gaming. Overall, I'd say I'm quite happy with the laptop itself. For my needs, I think the machine may have a bit more power than I actually need. I probably could have gone with a machine that was around $800-$900 but I had heard some negative things about the wireless card, the screen, and graphics card in the Lenovo Y410p, which is the other machine I was considering. In the end, this pushed me over the edge to go with the MSI. I felt the extra $300 would be worth it in the long end. Plus, the 760m in the MSI is considered much better than the 750m. My only other qualm is the size of the laptop, it's not huge by any means, but I bought this mainly for portable gaming for weekends that I blow out of Manhattan to spend at my parents' house on Long Island.

I've played a fair amount of DOTA2 on this machine. It runs it very well as DOTA isn't a demanding game. The rumors about the machine heating up when playing games are true. It does get quite hot. But, I'm not sure how much of an issue that is as this is a gaming laptop. It's not meant to sit on your lap while you play. I am not as sophisticated as other users here so I can't tell you what temperatures it was running at. It tends to get loud while playing as well. Both of these issues (heat and noise) aren't bothersome though. Especially with headphones on when playing. I think as gamers, we just get a bit worried that we are going to fry our cards. I've done my research though, and from what I understand, the heat shouldn't damage the machine itself unless you are gaming for 6-8+ hours without giving it a break. I am 26 and don't have that type of time. So it's not an issue for me. But, if some of you 16 year olds out there are looking at this MSI, that may be an issue for you. It's a personal thing.

Overall, I'd say I'm quite happy with this laptop. It's a gaming laptop but looks very professional. Even with the dragon eyes on the lid, which aren't even noticable. For a 14"" gaming laptop, I'm not sure what other options out there can hang with the MSI GE40. It's very light as well, which is a nice plus. It's less than an inch thick as well.

Let me know if this brief review helps anyone out. Also, feel free to ask me anything! Cheers!",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1hqxv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1hqxv8/msi_ge40_user_review_ask_me_anything/,

1. First thing i did is go to windows update(under control panel) and install the updates.
2. Opened ""Lenovo Companion"" (it was one of the tiles) and updated the drivers. 
3. Downloaded GeForce Experience (just google it) and updated the drivers (latest drivers were already installed in step 2).
4. Uninstalled the crap ware which i didn't find useful (Cyber.. software and few others)
5. Played FIFA 13, Tomb raider (2013)  and Batman: Arkham City (2011). 


FIFA 13: worked like a low requirement game even with all settings as high. No heat generated.

Tomb raider (2013): played with default settings (all settings were at normal, resolution @1080). Graphic card on the left became warm after some time. I came to know about msi after burner today. Will update the post with temperatures once i go home (@ work now).

Batman: SLI kicks in for this game. Both the graphic cards got warm.

I have never used a full HD screen and was blown away by the real estate I had.

Will update with more details!!!!

/*/*

EDIT:

1. Played Hitman Absolution. SLI kicked in. Both the cards went to a maximum temperatures of 80 and 88. The game stopped working, probably due to over heating. I was able to play for half hour. The graphics were amazing (default settings). A cooling fan will solve it?
Ordered wireless keyboard and mouse. Will order cooling pad next week.
&lt;&lt; Wireless keyboard and mouse have arrived! &gt;&gt;

2. Played Batman for 1 hour. Temperatures were: GPU 1 67 and GPU 2 65

3. Tombraider had similar temperatures after 1 hour. SLI was switched on by the time i was quitting. Probably it switched on sometime in the middle.

4. Does any one know if cooler master x3 is a good cooling pad?

the [sager NP6165](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np6165-clevo-w150er-p-4344.html?wconfigure=yes) (~$1017 with IB upgrade, GT 650M 1GB GPU, and OS)

the [sager NP9130](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np9130-clevo-p151em1-p-4340.html?wconfigure=yes) (~$1211 with IB upgrade, GTX 670M 1.5GB GPU, and OS)


and the [sager NP9150](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np9150-clevo-p150em-p-4341.html) (~$1357 with GTX 670M 1.5GB GPU and OS)


I guess I should start by saying that my current laptop is my primary/only computer, is 5 years old, and has only integrated graphics; so I'm aware that any of these will blow me away with the improvement. With that said, I would like to get the most bang for my buck, and while I don't do anything thats going to require the absolute best specs possible, I would like this to be relatively future-proof. It would be awesome if I could get another 5 years out of my next laptop.

Obviously there are performance differences as well as a price point differences between the three. I've been leaning towards the 6165 (with processor upgraded to IB), but cant decide whether its worth the extra money to switch to the 9130 (also upgraded to IB) or even go to the 9150.

some questions:  

* it seems that only the 9150 has a GPU that is user upgradeable, is that correct? is this something I should even care about, since it already comes with the best GPU of the three?

* I was thinking I would keep the optical drive as a DVD drive (or maybe even upgrade to a blu-ray drive) as I do not have currently a TV or dvd player, and my computer is my primary way of watching DVDs.  
With that in mind, I see that the 6165 has 2 internal hard drive options, so I could do an SSD drive for the OS, and have a HDD for regular storage. Would you recommend doing this before upgrading to either of the other models?

* Along the same lines, the 9130 and 9150 both mention a ""mSATA SSD Drive"" option. What exactly is this, and is it worth the extra money? I would guess its a boot drive for the OS, but didnt want to make any assumptions. Since it comes in 40 or 80 GB, would I need to go the full 80 for it to work properly as a boot drive?

Other general questions:  

* Will I notice any difference between the GPU's if I upgrade? I plan on buying Diablo 3, but other than that, I don't do much graphics-intensive gaming. Will there be a noticeable difference there?

* Is it worth the $70/$95 to upgrade the screen to the 95% gamut option?

* I have seen others suggest doing the harddrive caddy for the optical drive, buying the SSD myself and swapping it out to save a little money, but I've never done anything like that before and its a bit intimidating. In similar fashion though, would it be possible to go with the 6165 (with HDD) and select no hard drive for the second internal drive; then buy a 120 SSD and swap it myself that way instead? (the advantage being that I could keep my optical drive as a DVD/blu-ray player)

Any insight is welcome, as well as other computer suggestions if you feel a different one will suit me better. As I said, biggest priorities for me are bang for my buck, able to run diablo 3 comfortably, and relatively ""future-proof""

* edit: one more question, if I were to go all out for the 9150, is it worth the $100 to upgrade to the GTX 675M 2GB GPU?

1319842786.0,15,self.SuggestALaptop,lsprg,"My official review of the Sager 5165. [bought for college, Compsci major / gaming]",17,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/lsprg/my_official_review_of_the_sager_5165_bought_for/,"Hey everyone. I recently purchased the Sager 5165 at the request of this subreddit. While I was doing research, I noticed that there was a lack of reviews given to this machine, so I thought i'd do everyone a favor and submit one of my own!

I am a computer science major who is a fairly competitive starcraft 2 player (high masters level) with a $800-1000 price range. I was looking for a laptop that could handle a medium to heavy amount of gaming (and word processing / internet browsing / coding). I'm stating this because i'v noticed many of you on this subreddit are looking to do similar things.

The cost of this laptop in it's stock form was $849.00. As with some other custom laptops, this does not include the price of the OS ($70 i think), which I bought from xoticpc so they would install it. Note: I'm not exactly sure if you could get microsoft's ""student discount""($30) for windows 7 this way, but it would be worth investigating. The stock specs for this laptop are [here](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np5165-clevo-w150hr-p-3063.html). If you plan on investing in this machine, I would advise upgrading to 6Gig of ram for an extra $25 (worth it), and upgrade to the 500Gig hard drive for only $15(also worth it).

Aesthetically, it is a very sturdy, solid machine. I've spent hours gaming on it, with very little heat problems (I imagine this would be totally nulled with a laptop pad). The screen is excellent, and displays well in all lighting. They keyboard is great and even comes with a num pad and fingerprint reader (biometrics ftw!). Some cons about the aesthetics: I'm not a huge fan of the touch pad that this comp comes with, because the surface is slightly rough, and with use has smoothed out. When closed this laptop gathers fingerprints easily.

Sound: If you want a computer with great sound, this is NOT for you. The sound quality out of the built in speakers is quite disappointing. Luckily I generally use this with headphones or speakers so it hasn't really bothered me at all.

Speed: This computer is fucking fast. It boots up in like 5 seconds, and can handle Starcraft II on med-ultra settings *while* live streaming over the internet using xSplit, with win amp, skype and many browser tabs open. It gets a little warm while doing all this, but it's expected. While not streaming, pure ultra settings is easily playable. I anticipate being able to play Skyrim on mostly high settings without much difficulty. The video card is utterly sick for a laptop.

Battery / components: I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of battery life this delivered for such an expensive laptop. It will last 3-5 hours with the display dimmed doing an average amount of browsing the internet. I've been able to watch an entire movie (2 and a half hours) with full display and sound before it shut off (like 15% remaining) so that's pretty good I suppose. I'm not exactly a hardware expert, so I can't speak for the overall ""quality"" of the battery, but for my purposes it seemed really good. I've gotten minimal use out of the camera, but all my experience with it has been great. The laptop also came with a disk of drivers. It comes with plenty of USB ports and other ports. I should also mention that I do a lot of gaming with a keyboard / mouse / monitor setup that works incredibly well. I'm aware that you could manage a dual monitor setup this way, but I haven't needed to figure out how to set that up yet. I mentioned being able to play SC2 online while live-broadcasting, but I didn't mention that I'm able to do this with the built-in wireless internet. Not sure if that is groundbreaking or not, but I thought for sure I would have to plug in ethernet to do it.

Overall impressions: Very satisfied with the product. I have had no glaring issues with it (other than the sound, which is fairly pathetic as I mentioned) and would absolutely recommend it to anyone in my situation. This will perform all your day-to-day computing needs as well as deliver in a big way if you want to do a decent amount of gaming. I can't imagine there are many other notebooks out there that will give you this type of gaming power for under $1000. There are obviously high end gaming laptops that will go nuts, but the fact that this comes with a great processor 6gb ram and a 500 hard drive as well as a video card with 2gvram... great deal.

Final thoughts: Great laptop, dec price, looks sick.

Good luck in your comp search!

Im a pretty computer literate person. My model is the one from newegg with SLI 750m and 12GB of ram. It cost $1150 but i got it for $1050 with the June $100 ecoupon. I received it almost exactly 2 months ago. I have not done any kind of overclocking or hardware modification. My power charger is plugged into a surge protector. My laptop started to fail about one hour ago and is now not functional. 

I had been playing Hitman: Absolution for about 20 minutes. My laptop was sitting on my desk, not a pillow or blanket, where it always is when I'm playing games, so airflow was in no way restricted. I have played this game on this laptop for extended periods before and had no problems.

Suddenly, my frame rates fell to (guessing) 5-10fps and the fans on both sides of the laptop began to spin very loudly at full strength, blowing out hotter air than usual. This lasted for about 30 seconds before the laptop crashes and turned off. At this point my room was, and still is, filled with a faint but noticeable acrid smell. 

When I tried I turn on he laptop, it booted normally. It did not display the screen that laptops do when they're powered on after hibernating. The first thing that I noticed was that my screen was flickering. When I unplugged it, the screen flickered brightness would start to change randomly. Frame rates in games were also about 1/3 of what they usually are. 

When I removed the 2nd GPU and booted up, it would only run on Integrated graphics. The primary 750m was not recognized, not even from the device manager. When I tried to run a game, I got the expected frame rates from the IGPU. The fans were running much louder than usual. When I shut down and reinserted the 2nd GPU and started again, both GPUs were recognized. Doing all of this lasted about 30 minutes from when it first crashed. While I was googling my symptoms the computer crashed again. It will not turn on. When I press the power button, the Lenovo logo appears as normal, but after a few seconds it shuts off. I am able to access the BIOS but it still shuts off almost instantly. I have tried with it plugged in, with it on battery, and with it plugged in without he battery. 

Nothing works. Now I'm here writing this post on my iPod touch. 

Obviously I will have to retun this to newegg. There is no reason that they wouldn't accept it. I'm not sure if I want them to replace it or if I should go with a different laptop. I'm strongly considering giving up on a high performance laptop and building a desktop. Would newegg refund the money I spent on the y510p to spend elsewhere? Or would they give me credit with them? Or would they demand that I get another y510p? I've never dealt with returning something that I bought online. I still have most of the packaging.

Update: afte sitting offline for the night, it booted up again. Sort of. Everything opens and works correctly, but at the performance of a potato. The last computer that I've used that ran this slow was from 2003. When it turns on the ozone smell also comes back. I think that it's only booting up because the computer is ice cold and it crashes after just a few minutes. Luckily this means that my HDD is fine and I haven't lost any data. Computer is still toast rthough. ",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1376227547.0,,,True,t3_1k4iq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1k4iq0/psa_my_y510p_just_broke/,

Sager NP 8230 is a 15.6 inch laptop that in my opinion is pretty amazing

When you first see it its a little bit of a behemoth especially since i was previously using a 13-inch Macbook. Its kind of blocky design , but not anywhere near as ugly as a Lenovo. But just to be clear is it a little big and if you're not used to it it'll have a little heft to it. I don't think it'll be a huge burden for a student moving often but you'll definitely know whether or not you remembered to put it in your bag or not each morning. Other thing to note, I haven't experienced this but a friend with the exact same laptop had this to say, it doesn't fit in a 15.6 laptop case I think primarily because its a little thicker than most so he had to go ahead and get a random carrying case. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that yet but I would guess just buy a specific Sager made 15.6 carrying case to solve that. I've been playing a multitude of games on it so far just trying things out, starting with Saint Row 3 to Bioshock Infinite, and mount and blade and for an old  school Dawn of War. Each game ran exceptionally with not issues with lagging or anything messing up at all game wise. Everything ran smoothly even when I was contantly downloading different things and left everything open as I was playing the games. Only thing was Infinite had a glitching line from left to right about 3/4 of the way up the screen but I minimized the game and then minimized some other windows and it fixed it, I pretty confident it wasn't the computer it was just some conflicting things fighting for dominance. 
First impressions once again are first its size and weight which I'm already used to after a day. and just how quickly it starts up and how it responds. The keyboard's keys are a little bigger than normal I think which is perfect because you quickly learn where each is but they're not to big to get in the way. The trackpad is a little odd however it feels like a fine grit of sandpaper and feels kinda weird at first and I prefer using a mouse but again thats also because I've been gaming so I haven't had the chance to get used to the trackpad. Okay this is a little funny the finger recognition isn't terrible, you can actually use it to login and its worth the 2 minutes or so to setup which is kinda cool. Besides that terribly written paragraph or so Its black with purty lights and when you first get it its kinda fun because you have to hunt for the power button because it hides in the black (it is in a totally good place though no worries)

I'm sure I forgot some stuff so feel free to ask and I'll get to it as soon as I can. Overall I love this thing. ",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1h4ouc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1h4ouc/short_review_of_sager_np8230/,
1372029555.0,13,self.SuggestALaptop,1gxnr9,[User Review] Ideapad Y500,15,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1gxnr9/user_review_ideapad_y500/,"I recently purchased an [Ideapad Y500](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/y-series/y500) after getting some advice from this subreddit. I'd like to give a hands-on initial review of it.

So, first off, some details about what I got: I went a little overboard and got the most powerful version they were offering. 16 Gigs of RAM, SLI, the works. This thing is a monster.

**PROS:**

* The keyboard feels great to type on. I know this is a little thing, but it's just such a good keyboard that I feel it gets special mention.

* All the usual Windows 8 commands are in the function keys (Fn+whatever). You can turn off the mousepad, open up accessories, search, Wifi on/off. I really like this.

* Numpad! (Dell Studio lacks a numpad. I didn't even know how much I missed one).

* Battery life is good. They advertise 3 hours, and I'm getting somewhere around that.

* This thing handles graphics-intensive games like a CHAMP. I'm maxing out games and still having Spotify and Facebook in the background.

* The way this thing handles heat. It pushes the hot air out the left side, as opposed to down/back. This means you can use it on a bed. I've played Warthunder right before falling asleep. It's wonderful.

* It's build like a tank. Very solid construction.

**CONS:**

* This may be software, but sometimes Youtube/Chrome locks up on me. All it takes is Alt-Tabbing away for a second, and it's back in order.

* It's a little heavy. Not brick heavy, but it's definitely got some heft to it.

* Price-wise, if you want to go for the most powerful one, you'll be out a considerable sum.

* The trackpad is pretty mediocre. It's the kind with the built-in mouse buttons, so there's no ""click both to simulate middle-clicking"" option. Although anyone who gets this laptop will undoubtedly be gaming, so a mouse is a given.

As you can see, I love this thing. The cons aren't even really issues, except for the price.

If I were to give this a rating, it'd be **5/5**. Sincerely one of the best laptops I've ever seen or used.

EDIT: Added another Con.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1372038524.0,,,True,t3_1gxnr9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1gxnr9/user_review_ideapad_y500/,
1370371601.0,14,self.SuggestALaptop,1fo242,Do not purchase a Y500 SLI. It is a terrible laptop.,33,19,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1fo242/do_not_purchase_a_y500_sli_it_is_a_terrible_laptop/,"Just putting my two cents in since people seem to think that this laptop is the best bang for your buck. I purchased the Y500 750m SLI version and it is one of the worst laptops I have ever owned. 

First, the trackpad is one of the worst trackpads I have ever seen on a laptop. It is not accurate, and everytime you press the buttons, it feels like its going to fall through the case. Most trackpads that I've seen are part of the case, but not this one. Do not eat near the trackpad because you will get crumbs stuck between the crack of the pad and case.

Second, this computer has a serious issue when it comes to MICROSTUTTERS. I cannot play a game without it stuttering every ten seconds. I already reformatted twice and installed the latest drivers from NVIDIA and I think this is just an issue with this graphics card. I know it is an SLI issue because when I turn it off, the stuttering goes away. For me, this is the deal breaker.

Third, Lenovo has terrible customer service. I have complained about these issues but they will not take back the laptop because I am 3 days over the return period. I understand that techinically, they do not have to take the laptop back, but I have dealt with companies that were willing to go above and beyond to satisfy their customers. Lenovo is not one of those companies.

This is just a vent because I am so pissed off about my experience, but if I can sway even one person from buying this piece of shit laptop, then I will sleep happier tonight. The Y500 SLI might have been a good choice 6 months ago, but you can find better laptops for the same price. If you want a similar laptop, you are better off buying [this.](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np8230-clevo-p151sm1-p-5840.html) 

Anyway, thanks reddit for listening to my rant.

TL:DR - Lenovo Y500 SLI has a terrible trackpad, microstutters in games, and has terrible customer service.

I'm thinking it's perfect but just had a few thoughts about it. How good is the i5-4200U processor? It sounds/seems pretty weak. I know I do not need an i7 but will I be ok with this ULV? Can this processor handle HD streaming and light gaming well or will it struggle at all?

This laptop comes with GT 750m which I believe is a very solid graphics card correct?

I don't know if anyone is familiar with this model since it hasn't been talked about much, but I am a bit weary of the battery life. It is estimated at 8 but I'm sure that's very generous. With a 4 cell battery and the specs info posted, is it more like it's only in the 4 hour range? If so, that's a bit unfortunate as I would hope for 6 hours. My main uses with this laptop will be daily work, HD video, and occasional gaming. 

I need a laptop to last me the next 4 years of college. Does it look like this would be a good candidate? And with laptops that have their batteries sealed in, how long do they usually last or how long are they good for?

Big thanks to evanstueve (http://www.reddit.com/user/evanstueve) for the suggestions / info. You should get commission from Apple for this. 

I confirmed w/ a rep that I can return it to a retail Apple store within 14 days of purchase, if needed. Also comes with a full 1-year warranty, although I'm not too worried, I've read that refurbished Apple products are more strictly screened than brand new ones. 

I'll install Windows 7 or 8 via boot-camp; hopefully I can still get 6-7 hours battery life. 

I also went for the Apple Financing, 3 months no interest, to help out w/ the Vegas trip's expenses; whole sign up process was effortless. 

With taxes it came just shy of $2200; I think, for the price, the specs beat the Razor Blade, the only other contender.

Thanks all. 






ORIGINAL POST: 



Price:

- I'm prepared to drop ~$2,000; I want it to last at least 5 years (build quality must be premium)



Hardware requirements (FIRM):

- 4th gen Intel i7 quad core (probably narrows everything right down)

- Ability to drive a second monitor at 2560x1440 (I have one of those QHD monitors from Korea via eBay; I assume this means the laptop needs a display port)

- At least 8 GB of RAM (I often have many resource-hungry windows open at once; also see next point)

- Ability to leave laptop running on standby all the time, so that I can just open her up, do stuff, and close it, without having to power-up/restart

- Solid state hard drive, 256 GB would be sufficient (I have a 4TB home media server)

- Solid battery that will give me 6-8 hours runtime (I want to sit out on the balcony to play StarCraft or remote-login to work; I assume more cells is better)

- At least a 15"" screen, and a resolution of at least 1920x1080



Hardware requirements (LOOSE):

- Touch screen would be nice, but is not a requirement

- Ultrabook-like dimensions and build would be preferred (I'd rather not lug around a giant gaming laptop, like those monster ASUS or MSI ones)

- Windows 8 or 7, don't matter

- The Mac-book-style magnetic power cable plug, so when my ladyfriend inevitably trips over the cord she doesn't cause damage (I assume Apple has this patented)



Software I most commonly use (mediocre given my hardware wants):

- StarCraft II / Portal 2

- Microsoft Office Suite

- Visual Studio 

- Remote-desktop-login to work

- Chrome

- Media Monkey / iTunes

- Photoshop / Paint Shop Pro / Paint.NET



Models I've considered:

- 17"" Razorbook (gorgeous; neato little touch-screen track pad; but it's pricey, and I've read about heat issues)

- Asus Zenbook Infinity (but she's still a mystery, wrapped in an enigma)

- Dell XPS 12 (if only it had a larger screen)



Questions:

0) Any experience with the Razorbook? Is it the cat's ass? 

1) Is there a website out there where I can just put in all the key characteristics, and it will spit back those laptops that fit the bill? Or is that essentially what this subreddit is? 

2) Also worth mentioning: I'm in Canada; I'm travelling to Las Vegas for a week in about two weeks. I'm not oppose to buying said laptop in the US during my visit. Is FRY's a good bet to buy from? I've never been. Only other US retailer I can think of would be Best Buy or Costco. (At least with Costco I believe I can buy from a US store and still return at a Canadian store.) 

3) Would a dedicated 2 or 3 GB NVidia graphics card be better than the latest Intel HD on-board graphics with shared memory with 8 or 12 GB of RAM? Primarily for StarCraft, but also games like Portal 2 and potentially Titan, whatever it is, whenever it comes out. 

4) Should I wait until Christmas, when the Haswells have settled and there are more options / sales?

1362091145.0,14,self.SuggestALaptop,19fajg,$2000-2500 Gaming Desktop Replacement,14,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/19fajg/20002500_gaming_desktop_replacement/,"**TL;DR** (Questionaire and other info and questions below): My current gaming laptop (a 4-year-old Toshiba Qosmio) has started overheating when I play games (initially it only happened with Borderlands 2, more recently it's happened with Left 4 Dead 2 and occasionally even when not playing any games at all), so I've decided it's time to replace it.

I'm looking for a desktop replacement in the $2000-2500 range (overall, I'm more concerned with performance, longevity, and getting my money's worth than budget).  I'd like this computer to last at least 4-5 years, and don't want to encounter a game I can't run during that time, although I'm okay if I have to turn down the settings towards the end of its lifespan.  I'm very wary about overheating, since I've had a number of computers, including my current one, that I had to replace due to heating problems before performance became a huge issue (most recent one was already repaired once for overheating after 2.5 years before it started overheating again more recently).  

I'm currently mainly looking at the high-end Sager and MSI laptops, since most people recommend them for high-end gaming laptops if you just care about performance and don't want to pay a premium for a flash Alienware-style case, but I'm unsure which specific computer would be best to get overall and which customization options are or aren't worth paying extra for.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: ~$1500-2500, could go a bit higher.

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming, desktop replacement.

* Screen size preference: 15-17"".  Not a strong preference.  I may end up hooking it up to a keyboard and monitor and using it like a desktop most of the time anyway.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows 7.  It's possible I'll install a Linux Dual Boot on it at some point, but its main use is going to be as a Windows gaming machine.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Only game I specifically have in mind right now is Borderlands 2 (which causes my current gaming computer to overheat), but in general I'd like to be able to run any current game on high/ultra settings with good FPS and, more importantly, I'd like to be able to run any game that comes out in the next 4-5 years without a problem (I'm okay if I can't play graphics-intense games on ultra settings 4 years from now, but I want to at least be able to play them on native resolution if I turn down the settings a bit).

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Might do some coding, but I usually use a different computer for that.  This computer will mostly be for gaming.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Probably self-support or taking it to a nearby repair shop.  I'm at a school but I don't know if they'd support this computer.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): No preference.  Whatever works best.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): No strong preference.  Not particularly into the flashy Alienware-style cases, something plainer is just fine, if not preferable (I currently have a Toshiba Qosmio with a flame pattern on that back because that's the only design it came in, but it's a bit much in my opinion).

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Probably low weight, but neither matters to much since it will usually just be sitting on my desk.

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality, for the most part.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Mostly high performance, but I've had a number of problems with computers, especially laptops, overheating in the past, and high performance does no good if the computer crashes due to overheating (my current gaming laptop can still maintain a framerate I'm okay with when playing games, it just crashes due to overheating after an hour or two, and it's already been to the shop once due to overheating problems a year and a half ago).  So ideally I'd like some mix of low heat and high performance.  Noise is not an important factor (I'd gladly take noisy fans if they reduced the risk of overheating problems).

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: I'd like 1080p, which seems pretty standard for high-end gaming laptops.

* A great keyboard: Not too picky about this, but I wouldn't mind paying a little extra if it resulted in a massive keyboard improvement (I may end up using an external keyboard but I'm not sure yet).

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Don't care at all.  I don't expect to ever use the touchpad.

* Great audio: Will usually use headphones, so don't care too much about speakers.  Might pay a little bit extra for better audio if it'll be noticeable with headphones, but not too much (I'm nowhere close to being an audiophile).

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.): Can't think of anything.

**Some things I'm currently considering**:

Most people point to MSI or Sager for someone looking for a high-end gaming laptop who doesn't care about getting a flashy case, so those are the main things I've looked at.  Top contenders right now are something like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834152362) for MSI or one of the high end sager gaming laptops on xoticpc (the NP9370, 9150, or 9570).  I'm also looking at the [Malibal Nine Series](http://www.malibal.com/notebooks/nine-x570se/), which I hadn't heard about until recently so I know very little about it, but it seems to offer similar specs to Sager and MSI for similar prices.

I'm particularly intrigued by the Sager NP9150 since it's much smaller and lighter than most comparable laptops (true, I'm mostly looking for a desktop replacement, but portability can still be a nice bonus), but worried that the smaller case might result in more heating problems than a larger laptop.  Is this a legitimate concern?

**Some specific questions:** 

In general, when choosing the exact features on a site like xotic PC, which features are general worth spending more on, and which aren't worth it?  

For example:

* Is it worth spending the money to get a better CPU than the 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 3630QM that most high-end gaming laptops have by default, or is that plenty?  

* How much RAM is it worth getting?  

* Are the more expensive wireless LAN cards worth it (I will usually be using wireless, not wired, so I'm definitely willing to pay more for faster/more reliable wireless).

* Is it worth getting a solid state drive?  How large?

* SLI'd graphics cards?  I've had problems with these in the past, and it seems like they could increase the risk of heating problems, as well as being much more expensive, but they do seem to be touted as a big feature for gaming performance.  Are they potentially worth it, or am I better off going with a single graphics card to save money and reduce heat?",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_19fajg,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/19fajg/20002500_gaming_desktop_replacement/,

1376163886.0,14,self.SuggestALaptop,1k3rl4,Solutions for the y510p trackpad [x-post from r/Lenovo],16,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1k3rl4/solutions_for_the_y510p_trackpad_xpost_from/,"When I was debating getting the y510p, a lot of the negative comments about the trackpad here had me worried.  They were all true, but I've been able to do something about it.  Here's what I posted to r/Lenovo:

I just got the y510p and I love nearly everything about it.  Like many others, I haven't been happy with the trackpad.  

The left and right buttons are integrated with the touchpad itself, which makes clicking a nightmare for me.  The pointer almost always wobbles as you make clicks, unless you keep your finger perfectly still.  Turning down the sensitivity helps when clicking, but then moving the pointer across the screen takes an equally annoying amount of effort.

My second problem is the fact that there's no edge scrolling, and with the factory drivers, you are forced to scroll with two fingers.  Call me lazy for wanting one-finger scrolling, but my I had it on my last laptop for 6 years and became very accustomed to it.

  
Anyway, here's how I managed to get the y510p clickpad to:

A) **behave as if it has two distinct mouse buttons** (dead zone for touch, only when clicking!!)

B) **have one-finger vertical scrolling**

  
Solution:

1.)  Go to Programs and Features and uninstall your current Synaptics Pointing Device drivers.  Restart.

2.)  Reinstall the driver package from the Synaptics site (not Lenovo) here:  http://www.synaptics.com/resources/drivers  and then Restart.

3.)  In Control Panel, open the Mouse settings, then go to the Device Settings tab and click Settings

4.)  Highlight ""Scrolling"" and make sure it is checked.  Click the gear icon and then go activate vertical scrolling.  Configure other options according to your preferences.

5.)  To get a ""dead zone"" where the buttons should be, go to the ""SmartSense"" settings.  Make your settings match [this image.](http://i.imgur.com/Q32nAn8.png)  That is, make the green selection rectangle cover everything but the mouse button area.  Click both 'Restrict pointing' and 'Restrict tapping.'  It is also very important that you set filter time to 0 seconds.  Otherwise, the dead zone will take awhile to activate after you lift your finger.  I prefer it to be immediate.

6.)  Explore the other settings and find what you like.  There are many more options that you don't get with the default Lenovo driver package.

2. build quality: haven't test it all, but it's pretty sturdy. The screen's outer lid, as in many other laptops, is not as firm as I would want it to be. Also, the case part where the DVDRW is under is a bit flexible. Nothing to worry about.

Is the performance boost and the extra battery life that Haswell offers worth $300? The advertised battery life is already over 8 hours and with rapid charge, a half hour at an outlet gets you to 80% charged. I'll be using the laptop for college in the fall (majoring in comp sci).

* 15.6” FHD 16:9 LED Backlit Wide screen (1920x1080) Super Clear Glare Type Screen
* Sager - 3rd Generation Intel® Ivy Bridge Core™ i7-3610QM (2.3GHz - 3.3GHz, 6MB Intel® Smart Cache, 45W Max TDP)

* 500gb (w/ 4GB SSD Memory) Seagate XT 7200RPM NCQ Hybrid (Serial-ATA II 300 - 32MB Cache)

IdeaPad Y580:

* 15.6"" FHD LED Glare Wedge 1920x1080
* 3rd generation Intel Core i7-3610QM Processor( 2.30GHz 6MB)

* 500GB 7200 rpm
* Windows 7 Home Premium 64
* $939


**TL;DR**

Similar laptops.  

Lenovo has a better graphics card and comes with OS but may be prone to overheating.

Sager (Clevo) has a worse graphics card, slightly better hard drive and no OS.  

I could probably get an OS image at school though.  

Anyone know laptops with similar specs for the same price?  
Required:

* 1920x1080
* 4GB ram or better (these have 8)
* nVidia GTX 650M DDR5 or better
* Intel Core i7-3610QM or higher

Ended up buying the Y580

Three bus. days after ordering, they called to confirm my order and said the build should take 7-10 business days. It shipped from Sager 6 or 7 business days later (depending on how you count it) and was in my hands June 11.

It came with a drivers dvd, a media software dvd (haven't looked at it), a carrying bag (that is ripped through in the corner) and a manual. I had ordered Windows 7, but when I booted up, the HDD was blank and there was no OS disk or key in the box. A phone call, an email, and a day and a half later I had an email with my product key. Two days after that I had the OS disk. Fortunately, I had a win7 disk from building my dad a desktop (/r/buildapc FTW) and you can install windows without a key for 30 days.

[Here she is](http://imgur.com/AL2vT), though there are loads of pictures just like these, so google for more. [Here](http://imgur.com/aHdoz) is the brick next to an aftermarket adapter I have for my hp g71-POS. 

I also bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056EW4A4/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00) hard drive caddy on Amazon for the hdd that came with it. I put a [Plextor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820249014) SSD in ($30 rebate) the main bay. [Here](http://imgur.com/yrQSQ) is the caddy installed, not quite flush. It doesn't have a place for the anchor screw, of course, but it stays pretty well. (After having it in my bag on cross country flight, I had to push it in a little for the comp to find the hdd.) With the SSD (and Sean's optimization guide, see /r/buildapc sidebar), the Windows loading animation just about finishes when booting up.

As for the machine itself, it's built solidly. The left side of the keyboard is a bit more clicky than the right side, I suspect from the ""gaming"" WASD keys. It runs extremely quietly. Not silent, but quiet. It also runs hot. As of right now, with this one Chrome tab open, and near zero load, the cores are ~47,45,45,45. Later I'll install Matlab and see how that goes. The most resource intensive game I have is Civ5, and it played like a dream. The fans did get a bit louder in game, but it was still respectable. The speakers are nice and loud, though not as quality as the Onkyo label led me to believe. Still okay for onboard laptop speakers.

Feel free to ask questions. Thanks (again) /r/SuggestaLaptop, for saving me from another crappy HP.

TL;DR: Xotic service was good, with caveats. Sager build quick, but not perfect. Computer is sexy and awesome.

In addition, I do want to maintain some kind of stylistic look that the Y510p has so **the Sager is not for me**. I know that's a popular suggestion especially considering it's performance relative to its price. 

Anyways, is there a laptop out there for me? I'm looking to spend anywhere between 900 to 1200 dollars on it.

* Country of purchase: Singapore
 
* Budget range: 1000USD or 1500SGD
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Ultraportable or ultrabook. To be used in University for an Econ major. I want a small, light-ish laptop for typing essays. 
 
* Screen size preference: 11.6' to 13'
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Low. Might be playing Company of Heroes 2 (low) or Crusader Kings 2 (whatever the highest I can get out of it). I already own a desktop for my gaming fix. The above mentioned games are more processor and ram intensive than gpu intensive.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Word. Excel. 1080p screen not required, though I would like a screen for easy reading. NON touchscreen.
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self support
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): None. 
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): [This](https://www.aftershockpc.com/AFTERSHOCK%20X11/) is a local laptop customisation company. I want a small, lightweight laptop. Discrete graphics are nice, but I'd rather have integrated graphics unless the laptop supports some sort of GPU power management option like that Nvidia Optimus tech.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

I built my own desktop gaming PC for my intensive gaming.) I basically need a laptop to lug around my university during the week.
 
* Screen size preference: Meh, not a real strong preference. My five-year-old MacBook (which died, hence this post) had a 13.3 inch screen, so I am used to tiny screens, but maybe 14 inch or 15.6 inch might be nice, if it will still fit in my backpack and is light weight.
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Not a Mac, they are too expensive for what you get, I think, after using them for almost 20 years. Never tried Linux, so that might be fun. But Windows might be the common choice. I have not really heard great things about Windows 8, though.

1370891672.0,10,self.SuggestALaptop,1g2aok,Had the worst experience with Newegg and the Dell 15r Special Edition laptop.,13,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1g2aok/had_the_worst_experience_with_newegg_and_the_dell/,"So I bought [this laptop from Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834200695) and I have to say that this is the worst tech purchase I've made in my entire life.

First of all, I paid extra money for same day delivery that was delivered to me the next day. I opened a claim for that and thankfully had it refunded.

As soon as I received my laptop, I opened the box, plugged the laptop in and turned it on. A few seconds into the Windows 8 configuration and the laptop crashes. I restart the laptop after it's charged for a bit and the Operating System looks like it's malfunctioning. The laptop boots up to the desktop that shows no icons whatsoever. The Metro tile interface doesn't show up at all at this point. I restart it again and this time it Metro shows up but everything is sluggish and barely responding. I manage to reset Windows, which takes a few minutes, and everything looks normal this time, except now my Wi-Fi doesn't work and the DVD drive doesn't work. I reset it one more time and try to install the drivers that came with the CD, but the problems were still there. After researching for hours online, it looks like I'll have to do the long reset, which takes 4-5 hours. And after that reset, it still felt sluggish and froze quite a few times. I found out that others have the same problems as I do and it's something to do with the laptop itself.

I call Newegg and ask for an RMA, explaining the entire situation. I explain to them that this seems like a laptop issue others have had and I do not want a replacement or my money back, but I would like store credit instead to buy another laptop that actually works. The representative tells me that if they inspect it and it works fine, they will send it back and charge me for the shipping. So I do it and send it back.

After 7 business days of no emails or contact from Newegg, I check my account manually and it says they've refunded me my money but they've charged me $105 restocking fee. I call to ask why and they tell me that their inspection team found nothing wrong with the laptop, so they charged me $105 restocking fee and refunded me the rest. I ask to speak to a supervisor who tells me that they sent me emails explaining what happened, which I never received. After half an hour of explaining to her that the laptop malfunctioned from the start, that it was a general issue this laptop seems to have with many other owners, that my shipping was late and that I was not contacted whatsoever, she just kept repeating herself.

This ended up with her saying, ""Fine, I'll just send the laptop back to you and won't refund you anything."" So now I'm going to have to wait even longer for them to send the laptop, which doesn't work, back to me. What the hell am I supposed to do? I can't even resell it because nobody else will buy a used, defective laptop!

**TL;DR I've paid for $790 for a malfunctioning laptop that I haven't had access to for over 2 weeks and Newegg won't seem to do anything about it.**

The funny part is, as soon as I got off the phone and checked the laptop on their site, it says ""Discontinued"". Hmm, I wonder why? What shitty service and what a shitty laptop!

**EDIT: After that phone call in the morning, I never got an email or any sort of confirmation that they would indeed send the laptop back. Aren't I supposed to be notified at the very least?

Though I don't always have tons of time and don't expect to have much more next year, I like to play games when I do have the time and when I play them I don't like to play on anything less than high (I'm OK not playing on Ultra). The games I play tend to be in the more graphically intense realm (Witcher 2, Arkham City, BF3 etc...) 

What I'm trying to do is figure out what I want to do for college next year and I think this subreddit can help me out, as I bet there are a lot of current students in it. My budget is ~$1200-$1300 for whatever I end up getting, so I could spend it all on a laptop, or get a cheap laptop and a gaming desktop, though I'm really not sure how much I want to lug a desktop to college. That said, a ~$850 desktop and $450 laptop would have total better performance and lighter weight than a single gaming laptop, though I don't know if the build quality on the laptop would be as good.

I think a gaming laptop would be ideal because it can act as both a gaming system when I want it and be portable for taking notes and the like. It would also be nice to be able to game when I come home for breaks and not have to worry about transferring files between two computers.

Here are a couple direct questions:

* How heavy is too heavy to carry around? Is 6 lbs too heavy? 6.8? Is there a significant difference between carrying around a low range 5 pounder and a high end 6-7 pounder?

* How much battery life is necessary? Could I get by on something that only has 2.5 (cough Y510p)? Something that has 4?

* The school I'm going to blocks Steam on their non-dorm WiFi networks. For people with gaming laptops in colleges, do you guys use the gaming features of them anywhere but in your dorm?

Mostly I'm looking towards easy usability and overall being an alright gaming laptop. (Or atleast better at it than my XPS was)

So my choices are:

[Acer Aspire V3-571](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-Windows/dp/B0083GJEXC)

[An ASUS K56CM](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/K56CM/#overview)
[Stats for it](http://pastebin.com/kFepXkRi)

If those are crap ( I'm really having a hard time understanding that) I might go 100 over budget to get the only Lenovo in my country. But all the information posted about it is ""Y580 i5-3210M+HM76 4G 1TB nVidia Geforce GTX 660M 2G DOS"".

I'm also open for other options that are somewhere under $800. I know, I'm pretty dumb when it comes to technology. Thanks for anyone who can help! :)

I wanted something that looked sleek and was a bit on the lighter side, while still being 15.6"" and having a numerical keypad. A 3rd gen i5 and a decent amount of ram was a requirement also. I think this model is pretty darn new (like couple weeks new), so wanted to get opinions.

**Requirements**

 * Must **ship to the EU**. Country of purchase is Greece. This means it can't ship from the US as there are huge applicable taxes, but UK retailers that ship to Greece are fine.
 * Must **cost up to €1100** (about $1400).
 * Screen size **must be on the 15'' mark**. I had a 17'' laptop that I found uncomfortable to carry around and 14'' is too small to work on.
 * A regular full-size keyboard

A few words about what I do. I will use it mainly for coding. This means a lot of programming work on a command line and working with text. Also occasionally chatting, Internet browsing, e-mail, and minor design work in Photoshop, and sometimes watching movies and listening to music. Long hours of working on it, so the screen must not be too tiring. I'm going to look at it often for more than 8 hours / day and it's going to be mainly text.

I'm also doing game development, meaning that I sometimes need to do GPU-intensive work. I prefer programming for NVIDIA over ATI graphics cards, but that's not a huge requirement. I enjoy playing the occasional video game, so that's a ""nice to have"" if it can handle some modern games, although I don't need them to run at their best settings.

**Nice to haves**

 * Works well with both Windows and Linux
 * High screen resolution, typography that looks crisp and nice
 * Good keyboard where typing is smooth and fast. I've worked with an HP laptop and I like their keyboard.
 * A VGA port for a second screen.
 * Simple looks and design, no custom additional keyboard keys. I don't want it to look thick and bulky. Reasonably thin and minimal is good. Sides and bottom with a gazillion ports, stickers, holes and bumps are not appreciated. Although not hugely important, ""Thinkvantage"", ""Web"", ""Help"" etc. additional keyboard buttons are to be avoided.

**Preferred, but not required**

 * SSD is better than HDD
 * NVIDIA is better than ATI
 * A matte screen is better than a glossy screen
 * Within reason: Long battery life is better than low weight
 * Within the above budget: Build quality is better than low price

**Don't care about**

 * I don't care if it has a DVD/CD/blu-ray drive. As long as it has a USB port to do OS installation, I'm good without an optical drive.
 * I don't care if it has HDMI/Ethernet ports
 * I don't care if it has multiple USB ports or USB 3.0 support
 * I don't care about SD card slots
 * I don't care if it has a big hard drive. Even 100GB is OK.
 * I don't care about audio as long as it's reasonable
 * I don't care if the battery is removable
 * I don't care about heat

As already mentioned, I'm looking for a laptop that falls somewhere in between a Midrange and a gaming laptop. I was initially going to go for a midrange laptop but I've been having a hard time finding a midrange that can play games decently (mid settings or so) and then when i look to gaming laptops they have a lot more than I need and also tend to weigh a lot and the price jumps up too of course.

So in essence, the ideal laptop that I'm looking for is decent - good at gaming, not super heavy (~5-6lbs), has a decent battery life, and is more sturdy and will last longer than a Dell Studio 1558 (which I currently own).

So far, the best thing that I've found is the Lenovo Y570 but I wanted to see if there was something that fitted my criteria better before committing to it.

Suggestions, recommendations, or really any information would be greatly appreciated.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_qvovu,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/qvovu/college_student_looking_for_a/,

I'm currently looking at a 13"" Macbook Air with an upgraded 1.7GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7, upgraded 8gb RAM, 256 GB flash storage, and added external superdrive.  The reason why I did not want to upgrade my drive storage is because I want to pick up an external terabyte drive, I'm used that life style.  All of this runs $1558 with student pricing.  I'm questioning this choice largely because of the cost, I know I'm paying for the brand a bit, but I do definitely prefer the structure of OS X.  This will be my only computer and I need it to be powerful. I'm currently working off a borrowed 15"" HP Envy (its not very old) which is reminding me why I bought a MBP earlier.  This thing can barely run google chrome without overloading. A full screen video is normally out of the question. Something must be wrong with it but I can't figure it out.  So I've been out of touch mostly with pc computers for a while, can someone tell me if this mac would fulfill my needs, am I paying too much for too little, what comparable pc laptops should I be looking at?

I've only had it now for 2 days, so still just getting used to it.

A few of my initial impressions.  Windows 8 sucks monkey balls.  It sucks a lot less with a touch screen.  And even less still if you install one of the Start Menu add-ons.  But that has less to do with the Laptop and more to do with Widows.

Anyways, the overall machine feels quite solid.  Surprisingly solid actually because so many laptops you see these days are plastic.  The screen looks great, but a las it is shiny - I've never been a fan of shinyt displays, but to get a touchscreen, I guess there are no alternatives.  For those researching this laptop, I will make it easier for you guys and tell you that yes, it does indeed have a FHD display.  

A few other impressions, is that the touchpad (or I guess they call it a clickpad these days), is actually not to bad.  I have used other ones that felt flimsy as hell or the buttons were hard to click.  That is not the case here.  Its still not as good as a separate mouse, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting.  Also not nearly as bad as I expected is the keyboard.  In general, I don't like flat-keyed chicklet keyboards, but this one has a nice positive touch.  

Here are a few of the things I don't like:  

OMG, the power brick of this thing is HUGE.  I was hoping that it would be some small Apple-style brick, but of course not.  Its 6.25 x 3 x 1"".  The powerbrick on my GF's new laptop is, no kidding, 1/3 of the size of the one from Asus.  

The backlit keyboard is cool, but when you hold the keyboard at an angle, the LEDs are essentially shining in your eyes.  Its because the keys are so short.  You can turn the backlighting off, of course, but then its hard to read the keys because they are aluminum on an aluminum background.  

The door on the optical drive is way too easy to open, and it has a slightly sharp edge on the bottom.  I plan on fixing that by filing it down.  

Anyways, I figured I would write this and see if anyone had any question on this particular laptop.  Ask away, I'll be home later to answer anything I can.

Note:  I don't play computer games, so I can't give you info on stuff like that, but there is a video on YouTube where a guy reviews a bunch of games running on this laptop.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): None, I'd just prefer to have a reliable brand that won't give me a computer that'll just die in a year.

All I plan to do on this thing is surf the web, type up documents, and extremely light gaming in the form of emulators and roms. So I'm not looking for anything powerful.

1363278243.0,11,self.SuggestALaptop,1aai4n,A note about buying used laptops,13,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1aai4n/a_note_about_buying_used_laptops/,"Hi, guys!  I figured I would share my story about how I got my hands on my current laptop for &lt;$100.  
First of all, I'd like to say that there's nothing wrong with buying something that's used.  In fact, if it works, and it can do everything you need it to do, then why not?  If you have a budget of 500, have you eyes on a $450 machine, but you find the same machine, used and in good condition, on Craigslist for $200, then that just gives you a bit of money to splurge or save - and that's always a good thing.  
As for me, I became in need of a laptop about a year ago.  My old laptop was a GateWay (can't remember the model or anything like that), and it had 3GB of RAM and a 120GB hard drive.  These were the days when I was still running Windows in all of my ignorance, and this laptop, though adequate in its specs, somehow lagged when running a word processor, took a good 40 Seconds to boot up.  Now, I realize that the problem was that I was running Windows on it.  But that's not the point of this post.  About a year ago, the laptop died.  It, itself, was about six years of age, and I eventually figured out it was the motherboard that was at fault - it had fried.  So, fixing it would probably be costly and involve taking the whole thing apart.  So, instead, I decided I'd just see if I could borrow my friend's laptop while saving for a new machine.  Now, my friend had an old Toshiba Satellite A85, running Windows XP with just 512MB of RAM.  In the time between my laptop dying and my friend offering to let me borrow his, I started a new course at my College - a course on Linux.  Now, I'd used linux before, but only when I had to.  But this course gave me a reason to install linux on the laptop my friend was loaning to me.  On Windows XP, this thing really was hard to use.  Even though I'd done everything possible to optimize it, it still froze and/or lagged terrible when doing *anything* - from browsing the web with Chrome, to editing simple text documents, it seemed there was nothing that *couldn't* lag on it.  But after I decided to install Crunchbang Linux, it seemed to work fine.  Never froze, never lagged.  And so, I settled into using it for my classwork, my pr0n, and even playing some games on it (AssaultCube, Liquid Wars, ect).  Eventually, I told my friend that since he never used this laptop, I would like to buy it.  And he, still believing that it was a piece of crap, offered to give it to me for 60 dollars.  WIN.  So, a year later (a few weeks ago), I decided to upgrade it just a little bit.  I bought a 1GB stick of RAM  (1GB was this laptop's physical limit), so now, I can run memory-intensive things like VirtualBox, The Android Emulator (for another one of my classes), and no lag is noticable.  

Bottom line:
If you have a low, LOW budget, or if you want to save money, get a used laptop.  Before buying a used laptop from someone on craigslist, make sure it works.  Same principle as a car - demand to drive it around the block before buying it.  
If the existing OS is not running smoothly and it needs to be wiped/re-installed, don't worry about buying or pirating a copy of Windows - there's no need.  Most Linux distributions are capable of doing everything Windows can do, and better.  No need to worry about viruses, crashing, or anything like that.  You've got OpenOffice for doing homework, VLC for playing movies, and everything you really need comes standard with most Linux distributions.  That, and Linux manages memory better, allowing you to do more with less.  So, no need to buy/pirate an Operating System.

Anyway, I hope you guys liked this little rant about buying used Computers.  ",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1aai4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1aai4n/a_note_about_buying_used_laptops/,

So, my current laptop is starting to behave erratically, and I'm looking to see what my options are for a replacement. and I don't like what I'm seeing. Trying to customize a laptop with various manufacturers, it seems as if my desired features are not available together in a laptop short of some of the $1700 monster laptops out there.

I'd really like to have more than 2 cores, this laptop is a Phenom II Mobile X3, and I'd feel bad going back to 2 cores.(Especially for running virtual machines). 8gb or more is a must. Occasionally I manage to use all 16gb on my desktop. I would have a hard time going with a screen smaller than 17"" since I can barely make do with the 17"" 1600x900 screen on this laptop.  a full-size keyboard, with numberpad is a luxury i have grown accustomed to.

Windows 8 is a dealbreaker. There is no price at which I am willing to accept Windows 8. I would loathe to register as a Win8 sale to microsoft, so replacing a Win8 install with 7 or linux is no-go. I would go back to Windows Vista before I'd take Windows 8. I am also friendly to Debian-based Linux distros, anything I can use Apt-get to take the pain out of linux on. 

I suspect that nobody offers what I'm looking for in a price range I can afford.

I have a MacBook Pro, but some of the games in my steam library aren't supported on OS X, and I'm tired of OS X for other reasons. There's no good place to set up a gaming desktop at home and I would like a portable setup.

So I bought a Lenovo Y580 for $1008 after tax and shipping from NCIX. Then I bought 16GB RAM and and 500GB SSD for $542 at Canada Computers. Overall that's $1550 CAD for i7-3630QM, GTX 660M, 500GB SSD, 16GB RAM, and 15.6"" 1080p screen. The keys are also cylindrical which is good.

It arrived today and I'm not super happy with it. The first thing I noticed (because I'm subscribed to /r/MechanicalKeyboards) is that the key spacing on the number pad is too small. Normal key spacing is 0.75"", the key spacing on numpad keys on this board is 0.66"". There's enough space for them to have included a full width numpad so I don't know why they did that. That doesn't really matter though, since I would be using an external keyboard for gaming anyway. What bothers me is the build quality. Compared to my MacBook Pro with it's aluminum chassis, this thing feels flimsy. The bottom is entirely plastic. It's not thick solid plastic, it feels cheap and flexible. I can feel the entire thing flex when I pick it up, and the disk tray and battery pack can be moved about with a little bit of pressure. Unlike my Mac which stays completely rigid when I pick it up with one hand. I haven't used it yet (or swapped out the memory and HDD) and I'm thinking about returning it.

**Necessary Features**

* Solid build quality
* Good gaming performance

**Preferred Features**

* Metal body
* Matte finish on everything. EVERYTHING
* DVI or DisplayPort output
* Cylindrical keycaps
* Centered touchpad and no numpad
* Left and right click buttons for touchpad
* Matte screen
* Simplistic, stylish design

**Features that I hate but may have to live with**

* ""Gamer"" (read: ugly) design - Colourful lights, angular shapes, unnecessary features
* Shiny surfaces
* Brushed aluminum or plastic that looks like brushed aluminum
* Logos

I was so disappointed that the Dell XPS 15 has overheating issues.

Knowing all this, I'm looking to spend somewhere around $450, and my budget is a maximum of $500. I've looked a bit on Amazon and Newegg but I'm just completely out of the loop on brands. Also, I don't know if it's reccomended to buy a warranty off those sites or not.

I would greatly appreciate any help or suggestions from you all, thank you!",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_zapk9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/zapk9/macbook_just_died_need_a_new_laptop_asap_and_not/,

- i7 processor

- about 2.5kg would be nice, as would a decent battery life (where the MB excels I believe)

I'd appreciate it if you could offer your opinions on the matter.

1344996950.0,10,self.SuggestALaptop,y8m97,Review of the Lenovo ThinkPad T430s,12,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/y8m97/review_of_the_lenovo_thinkpad_t430s/,"So, a little over a month ago I was in most of your shoes, looking for a new laptop for college.  I’m going into my freshman year in the college of engineering most likely as a CS/Comp Eng/Electrical Engineering major.  I was looking for a laptop that would last me my 4 years in college and maybe one or two after that if I needed it.  What I ended up deciding on after hours and days worth of research was the ThinkPad T430s.

**Specs**
i7-3520M @ 2.9GHz
4GB RAM
1600x900 Resolution
Integrated Intel HD 4000 Graphics
Webcam, Thinklight, Backlit Keyboard
Fingerprint Reader
UltraBay Battery

**Portability**
After talking to many people in college about laptops, the big thing I heard was “don’t get a 17” laptop.  You’re going to be lugging that thing around to all of your classes, you want something light and portable”.  I went with the 14” screen over a 15” for portability, but truthfully I miss a big 15” screen from time to time.  That being said, this thing is light.  It’s no MBA, but I have no problem holding it out in one hand.

**Keyboard**
Many people on forums are freaking out about Lenovo’s new “island-style” keyboards.  I never used the old version that much, but I can say that after using this for over two weeks that it can’t be that much worse.  Personally, I love the new style.  It provides a subtle rubberish finish that allows your fingers to stay on the keys.  The keys are responsive and have a nice bounce to them.  Only complaint is that the function key is now in the bottom left hand corner, with the ctrl key being to its right.  I’m used to it being the opposite, but I’ll get used to it.

**Trackpad**
The trackpad is very nice. After using my friends T420s, I thought the textured trackpad was weird and uncomfortable. However, in under 5 minutes I was used to it and find it nice once again for keeping my fingers' grip.  I'd also like to add that the two-finger scroll is very nice. It's smooth and there's not jerkiness to webpages or long documents. Very nice subtle touch.

**Screen**
Could it be better?  Yeah, for sure.  This is my largest complaint about the machine.  I have the 1600x900 resolution and would highly recommend getting the highest resolution on ANY laptop that you get.  It really provides a crisp display.  The vertical viewing angles on this thing could be better, same with horizontal.  However, when you’re looking right at it (which you will be 90% of the time), it looks fine.  I wish this laptop could have the display of the Dell XPS 13 and it’d be a powerhouse.  Don’t let it dissuade you from buying this, just be aware of it.  If you’re doing word documents, redditing, spreadsheets, etc., you’ll be fine.

**Battery**
I have the 6 cell battery with the ultrabay battery.  I’m truthfully not sure exactly what the times are on it, but I can say that on normal reddit browsing, music, and videos I can get through a full day on one charge.  If I had to guess I’d say somewhere around 7 hours.

**Extras**
The Trackpoint (red dot in the middle of the keyboard) is really nice.  I never got how people used it over an actual trackpad, but it’s really nice not having to reposition your hands to move the mouse.  The backlit keyboard and thinklight are really nice.  I wish the backlight shined through the actual letters on the keyboard, but that’s just me being picky.  The thinklight is going to come in use for those late night study sessions, I can tell.  The audio is average I’d say.  I listen to a wide array of music (hip-hop, dubstep, country, rock) and I did expect a little more from them.  They get loud enough, but not enough to fill a medium-large room.  Maybe I’m just used to my external 2.1 speakers.  I have heard some amazing reviews on Dell’s speakers though.  

All in all it’s a great laptop.  The only regrets/complaints about it I have are 1)screen size 2) screen quality 3) lack of a quad-core i7 4) speakers (this one’s being picky though).  If you have questions, please ask.  I know what it’s like wanting to know all about something before I buy it, especially something like a $1500 laptop.

- Lightweight, and portable

- Price (although with student discount and selling the giftcard it's around $1000)

I actually received this laptop closer to 1 month ago, but various things including school and my larger and more important Clevo guide had come in the way. Now I've decided to push this out finally :) I guess that the delay will stop any excitement over receiving the laptop and allow this review to be as objective as possible.

**My Configuration**

My laptop is configured as follows: Pollux 1612 (Clevo P150EM): i7-3720QM | GTX 675m | 16GB 1600MHz RAM | Crucial M4 128gb + 500gb HDD | 95% matte screen | Intel 6300 .

**Mythlogic (Reseller)**

Mythlogic has been great throughout this entire process. Originally I was hesitant about ordering a laptop at a premium (around $100-150 on my configuration), but their support both before and after sale has justified that decision. Josh (co-owner I think) was responding to my emails at 11:30 at night requesting an order change (I'd originally ordered an mSATA cache drive setup before seeing the Crucial M4 price drop), and continued to help me. Also, when I had a few issues with Windows settings after setup they walked me through the entire process (I failed to specify that the laptop was to be in my name and not the cardholder's, so everything arrived calibrated for the cardholder).

I'd highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.

**Unboxing**

You can see the photos in the album that I've put below. I've also added some annotations in that album, both serious and comical (shall be up later, see the note at the end).

I chose the USPS Express shipping option (middle choice), and the laptop arrived after about a week and a half. Canadian customs had a field day with my order (MOAR TAXES TO COLLECT!), but apart from that the laptop arrived well secured and in working order.

I've removed any potential identifying information so don't think that there were boxes of colour on the package.

There was a lot of box-ception and a lot of packing peanuts. Beyond that I got the “concise” user guide, the power brick/charger, the battery, the laptop, a mousepad, a CD case with a recovery image and a Windows install.

I got a friend who ordered an NP9150 through XoticPC to get me an external optical drive since they were offering a $25 Blu-Ray Reader/DVD-RW/CD-RW, which was a great deal.

Yes, the power brick is big. In the album I have a photo showing the size of it compared to a Canadian 2 dollar coin.

**Build Quality**

The build quality of this laptop is great. There is very little flex in the build and it is not brittle (although I still treat it like glass). It is not on the same level of construction as a MacBook pro though (the metal construction is still much more solid). As far as plastic based laptops go, this one is very good.

**Ports**

Lots of ports! You could find a list on any of the Clevo seller sites (Xotic's one is good for this), but I have been able to plug in almost anything that I could think of. I'm not exactly sure what the powered USB port is or how to activate it. I haven't cared about it too much but I'll probably read up on it later. Needless to say the premise is pretty cool.

**Keyboard/Trackpad**

These seem to be the second most common complaints about Clevo laptops. I'm happy with the trackpad, and I'm also OK with the keyboard. The placement of the arrow keys is slightly unconventional (with a small shift key that gives way for the up arrow key) and that was tripping me up a bit, but with time that has gone away. I will say that if you don't hit a key on center there is a chance that it will not register. It doesn't bother me too much but if you aren't very accurate typing this may cause an issue for you.

I did however buy a Leopold FC 200r Tenkeyless keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches for on the go use. No laptop keyboard beats mechanical keyboards for typing and comfort (at least in my opinion).

Whoever thought that putting the sleep and mute shortcuts next to each other should have tomatoes thrown at them. It's annoying, but not annoying enough for me to change them yet. I do think that Auto-HotKey allows you to switch keys if it bugs you.

**Speakers**

I don't really use them all that much. When I do the speakers are a bit loud but the bass is muted. This is probably because the subwoofer is below the laptop :/

The headphone ports are fine. If your sound sounds like it's missing some high-end frequencies, open the THX program and change the balance to 50%. Trust me on that.

**Setup**

Everything was setup for me outside of the box, including the SSD maintenance options and such. Only issue was the user thing as I mentioned above, but that was rather easily corrected.

**Screen**

I can definitely notice the calibration and the saturation of the colours on this screen compared to other screens around my house. That being said, I don't exactly notice all the benefits of the 95% colour gamut. My mum has though, so because of that I will say that this was a good buy in general (not for me though, a standard matte would have probably sufficed).

**Temps**

Temps are fine for a laptop packing powerful hardware. I get around 40 degrees at idle, and 43-46 with Skype/Word Processing/Chrome on.

The fans are not noticeable while I'm using the laptop, especially since I'm on the front. When gaming with headphones, you won't hear the fans.

The fans do rev up noticeably while gaming, probably enough to wake a light sleeper if the fans are pointing at them from 4 metres away. After 6-10 metres you stop hearing it.

**Fingerprint Reader**

It's a nifty thing that's worked for me. I use it to logon. The software doesn't seem to be very stable with Chrome so I don't use it otherwise, but apparently you can configure it to log into accounts online. Cool, but not a dealbreaker/maker at any rate.

**Performance**

Performance is great all around. The SSD is noticeable and my entire experience is zippy.

I have not installed all the virtual machines that I plan on running just yet, but when I've been running a few the laptop has handled it just fine.

I have run the games that I have (LoL/CS 1.6/D3) at maxed. I do not run SC2 at maxed since I opt for the highest possible fps when plying (so all low @1080p), but I could run the game maxed if I wanted for a 1v1 and 2v2. 3V3, 4v4 and customs like Nexus Wars should not be run on ultra. I really wouldn't recommend it since in the late game everything slows down.

**Battery Life**

I get around 3.5 hours off battery with the power saver mode enabled. You need to be plugged in to activate the dedicated GPU, so I don't really feel like running that test. An alternative thing that I did is stream+watch youtube videos constantly. I managed to get 2h 10mins of battery while doing that.

**Overall**

I like this laptop. Mine didn't have any problems out of the box and it works well. I think that I'll be happy with this laptop for quite a while.

**5) Would you consider laptops that are refurbished/redistributed?**
As long as they can last me a few years and/or I can get some warranty to ensure that is the case, then yes--I would consider a refurbished/redistributed laptop.

**6) What are the primary tasks will you be performing with this notebook?**
As I mentioned above, primary tasks will be web browsing, email, &amp; streaming video (via netflix).

**7) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places, leaving it on your desk or both?**
Both, probably. 95% of the time will be desk/lap while at home, but occasionally, like when on vacation, I'll travel with it.

**8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so, please state which games or types of games?**
Aside from the occasional flashed-based webgame and solitaire, no. So, basically, no.

**9) How many hours of battery life do you need?**
I could go less if it'll help keep me in budget since, most of the time, I'll be in my apartment near an outlet. Of course, in theory I'd like a long battery life; but I'm willing to have less.

**10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?**
Buying online is fine with me as long as it has good reviews from a trustworthy source (such as r/SuggestALaptop!)

**11) What OS do you prefer? Windows (XP or Vista or Windows 7), Mac OS, Linux, etc.**
Windows 7, I suppose. I use XP at work all the time, and my fiance's laptop had Vista on it...but I really DON'T prefer that.

Screen Specifics

**12) From the choices below, what screen resolution(s) would you prefer? Keep in mind screen size in conjunction with resolution will play a large role in overall viewing comfort level. Everyone is different. Some like really small text, while others like their text big and easy to read.**
I usually set my resolution to the highest possible on whatever machine I'm using. I'm not a fan of the happy-new-year-1998 crowded display. That being said, I don't need 1920x1080 to be happy. Whatever I can stream netflix on without it being ridiculous works for me.

**13) Do you want a Glossy/reflective screen or a Matte/non-glossy screen?**
I'm flexible with this. Whichever.


Build Quality and Design

**14) Are the notebook's looks and stylishness important to you?**
No; as long as they don't weight a ton or are bulky as hell I'm fine with it.

**15) When are you buying this laptop?**
Since we're currently computerless, the sooner the better. I understand if I waited till post-wedding I'd be financially able to afford a better machine, which, given I want it to last for years, would theoretically be a better option...but the idea of going half a year without a computer doesn't sit well with me. So I'll probably be impatient and say ASAP.

**16) How long do you want this laptop to last?**
I'd say at least 3 years if that's at all possible.

Notebook Components

**17) How much hard drive space do you need; 80GB to 640GB? Do you want a SSD drive?**
I'm honestly not tech-savvy enough to know the benefits of an SSD drive. As for space, I definitely won't be needing 640GB. I'll say a moderate enough amount to allow me to store an average amount of music on the machine. I have an external hard drive too though, so this isn't a crucial concern for me.

**18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a CDRW/DVD-ROM, DVD Burner or Blu-Ray drive?**
Yes, I'd like one. CDRW/DVD-ROM would work fine for me. If I could upgrade to DVD burner I would, but I'm willing to just have a regular old drive to play and burn my CDs and play DVDs to keep things in my budget.

**The Details** 
Preferably something that can handle Skyrim on max settings with no framerate issues. Power and battery life are not much of a concern, it's more about the graphics capability.

**The Catch** 
It has to be $630 and under. It's a tough budget to work with and I've looked a few places by myself but hey, I'm a noob at this.

**What I've Found** 
Basically, it would be easier to get an HP or Dell since my sister gets a discount with them through work. I was looking at the HP dv6zqe and read a few reviews that said it could actually handle Crysis on very high, plus when I constructed it on the website it came out to be about $619.

My concerns now lie with which options are are going to be worth upgrading for my situation.

The most that I ever see myself doing at once on this laptop is Playing Diablo III while audio skyping and streaming music, while also having some internet tabs/word documents open. 



*From what I have read here, the ""matte type"" screen seems to be a worthwhile upgrade for $70

*Professional Monitor Calibration, what is this all about? are monitors not normally made well?

*For the not super intensive tasks I will be performing, will a $70 upgrade from an i5 to an i7 yield large benefits?

*the $25 Diamond Thermal Compound sounds like it is worth it, having read here that it can drop temps. 5-10 C

*the 650M GPU seems to be more than adequate for my needs, thanks to the [handy chart on the side bar](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-Games-on-Laptop-Graphic-Cards.13849.0.html)

*The 8GB 1600 MHz RAM and 750 GB hard drive $20 upgrade seem to good and easy to make choices

*I do not know too much about adding a SSD to the Second Hard Drive Site, but my first impression is that it will not drastically increase my experiences for the $215?

*Windows 7 for $80 is a need

*Overclocking for $75 and the OS Redline Boost for $55? I don't full understand these or how they would enhance the laptop performance for my needs.


Any advice on what potential upgrades may be beneficial for my needs would be greatly appreciated. As you can see, I am not the most tech savvy individual, hence my reading and posting in this subreddit.

I plan on purchasing a [Clevo/P150EM-SE]( http://www.malibal.com/lotus/) with a few upgrades.  I have a fairly flexible budget going up to $1,800 or so.
I know there are a lot of very knowledgeable people here, and I am looking for any input that you may have.  I am not dead-set on this computer, but I have done a fair bit of research, and I think it will suit me best for my needs.  I am, however, open to any suggestions that you may have.

-----

**Upgrades:**

* 15.6"" 1920 x 1080 FHD LED AUO B156HW01 V.7 95% NTSC Glossy Display
* NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 675M (Fermi) 2GB GDDR5
* Empty Hard Drive Caddy – instead of an optical drive
* Bigfoot Networks Killer™ Wireless-N 1103 802.11A/B/G/N LAN Card
* 128 GB Crucial M4 SSD will be purchased separately – It will be used for the OS, programs, and games.

-----

**Main Uses:**

This will be a multipurpose laptop.  I plan to use it for:

* Compiling – mainly C++ and python right now.  Nothing major, so this computer will be more than enough.
* Gaming – Tribes: Ascend, Skyrim, SCII, DiabloIII, Darkfall 2.0, ect
* Video and audio encoding
* Streaming HD video and audio to my home theater equipment

-----

**Questions:**

* Would you recommend waiting for the Ivy bridges to come out?  The only reason that I would want it before they release, is because I would like to have it before Diablo 3 releases on the 15th.
* How big of a difference can I expect the upgraded network card to make?  The main reasons for getting it are to help in the streaming of video wirelessly, and because I would like to keep my network latency as low as possible when playing FPS games.
* How easy is it to install the SSD into the drive caddy?  I am pretty tech-savy, and assume that it should be straight forward, but any input for someone that has done it before would be much appreciated.
* Lastly, I don’t need this to completely replace a desktop, but I would like it to able to hold it’s own with what I want to do with it.  What can I expect from it?

Thanks!

Edit:  Just talked to a rep from Malibal that said the caddy has a SATAII interface.  So I guess I will need to swap the SSD with the primary hard drive.

I also need it to be able to handle multitasking (having several MS Excel, Word, and large powerpoint files open along with pdf files and ~10 internet tabs open. It's also possible I might use MATLAB or some other software.

I just bought the Dell XPS 12 because I loved the idea of a touchscreen ultrabook convertible. But it has had some problems in the first few days, so I am going to return it. The wireless adapter is not very good, and there is no ethernet connector, so that alone is just too much of a risk. I don't want something I have to worry about. I just want something that will make working easier not more difficult!

Now, I am pretty open to anything. I think I could probably get a better quality machine for less money and plenty of storage if I look further than just the SSD ultrabooks.

The main things I need: 
Internet (good wireless adapter and hardwired Ethernet port)

VGA port or some kind of port that can be converted to VGA

Intel i5 processor (3rd or 4th generation)

4GB of RAM, preferably upgradable to 8GB.

Decent sized hard drive (500GB + but I would be open to a smaller SSD as as long as everything else was good.)

Decent keyboard and touchpad

I would like to have a touch screen for Windows 8

I am having an extremely difficult time choosing one because the reviews for almost every single laptop had such a vast range of opinions for them, so I'm just going to ask here.

I am a college student, but I live 40 minutes away from home so portability is going to be an issue. I am a gamer and I play games ranging from Dota 2 to Bioshock Infinite. I am looking for higher end GPUs and CPUs because I plan to use this laptop for a long time and I don't want it to be outdated any time soon.

I guess the most important thing I'm looking for in a laptop is, how is this laptop going to be three years later. For this to be good, the build quality and heat management needs to be decent, as well as the CPU and GPU.

I have considered Clevo (Sager) products, lenovo y510p, and the MSI Ge60 because they have excellent computer components, but I'm not sure how I would feel about them three years later (if they even last that long). I say three years because that's the longest I've owned a laptop. Not only are they heavy, but I heard lenovo had a bad build quality (especially with the SLI), MSI had extremely bad overheating problems, and something about that clevo makes me want to throw it out the window.

My most recent decision was the Razer Blade 14. Now, the only flaws on it that I have been able to find are :

Screen quality (I use another monitor a lot of the time, and I don't think I would mind a bad screen)

No ethernet port (I haven't used one in the last 5 years)

Price (I don't mind spending a couple hundred more dollars if I will be more content with it in the next 3 years)

So I guess my main question is, how is the build quality and heating issues with razer blade 14. My first impression on these issues is very good for the razer because it looks so much like the macbook (and I really like these aspects about the macbook). Reviews online seem to have mixed opinions about heat management on this machine. Is the razer blade the laptop I would want for three years?

Latest I'm able to wait is the first or second week of August, which is why I went ahead and ordered the MBA. Figured I could get used to the OS before I leave for school.

Here are the specs:

* 14.0"" FHD IPS Anti-Glare Matte-Type Screen (1920x1080)    
* Intel Core i7-4750HQ Haswell
* Intel® Iris Pro Graphics 5200
* 8GB DDR3 1600 (up to 16GB - 2x8GB SO-DIMMs)
* 13.39"" (w) x 9.96"" (d) x 0.83"" (h)
*  3.80 lbs (Xotic has 4.2 listed for some reason but everywhere else it's 3.8)
* HDMI/MiniDP/Ethernet/(3) USB 3.0
* With mSATA SSD, it has an open 2.5"" drive bay for an HDD addition
* Starting at $1119 with Crucial mSATA 128GB SSD and no OS ($1199 w/ OS)

Anandtech recently gave a few benchmarks on this system ([here](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7182/90-minutes-with-the-clevo-w740su-featuring-iris-pro-hd-5200)); for gaming benchmarks check out their 4950HQ preview ([here](http://anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested)), though that was with a 4950HQ which has the iGPU clocked *a little bit* faster, still should provide a good comparison. As you can see, the Iris HD5200 performs about on par with an Nvidia GT640m.

The system is also available configured with Ubuntu from System76 ([here](https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galu1) - starting at $995 with 4GB RAM &amp; 500GB HDD).

Obviously the gaming performance won't come close to that of [Sager NP7330](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np7330-clevo-w230st-p-6163.html), but this is 3/4 of a pound lighter, and an inch thinner.

Overall I think the system is a good choice for anyone who favors portability over gaming performance, but still would like it to be somewhat capable in that regard. Also this would be a solid choice for students, specifically ones using more demanding products like SolidWorks, MATlab, etc.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1jfa5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1jfa5j/sager_np2740_clevo_w740su_now_available_xoticpc/,

For the things I want to do, all of my friends are enthusiastically suggesting that I get a MacBook Pro.

Everybody in this sub though seems to be excited about Haswell Ultrabooks (I don't even know whether that's the correct term). I don't see any news about Haswells going into the MacBook Pros anytime soon though. Would it be better to possibly hold out for the Ultrabooks or should I just get the MBP?

I am looking for a replacement to my aging (Christmas 2007!) MacBook Pro. I have done a number of upgrades to it, but the processor is one I cannot get around. Right now it has 8gb of ram and dual internal hard drives. The boot drive is an SSD, but the secondary is a SATA.   I need piles and piles of space for all the development I do. I run lots of VMs for testing and between that and the fact that I triple boot OS X, Windows and Linux, have lots of development tools installed etc I run out of space quickly.  I don't buy a lot of laptops, I tend to do what I did with this one and squeeze every last bit of life out of them and do little upgrades each year. I simply cannot find one that hits all the right buttons.  Does anybody actually make the laptop I want?


* Intel Core i7 or better
* &gt;= 512gb SSD as boot drive 
* Option to toss the optical drive and put a Second big SSD
* Ram Expandable to &gt;= 16gb 
* 13-15 inch display  -- NO touch screen to get my finger smudges all over -- matte preferred 
* graphics card that doesn't suck and has hdmi out for an least one external monitor, preferably two
* Good audio for programming music via headphones
* Weight &lt; 5 lbs
* Latest Bluetooth and 802.11
* LINUX FRIENDLY


I am willing to ditch triple boot and go 100% Linux if necessary.  I don't care if it comes with Linux, so long as I can put whatever I want on it. I don't care how much it costs. I don't really care too much what it looks like so long as it doesn't make my eyes bleed.

Failing all of that, is there some kind of laptop / ultra book enclosure with a screen type of thing I could buy and put whatever guts I want in it?

I thought I knew what was up, but now all the hardware is different. Ugh.

I'm looking for a decent multi-purpose laptop that can run most games with ease, but should still be work friendly. From what I've read here, the two choices are the Y500 or a cheap customized Thinkpad (T430?). The thinkpad, even with the upgrades, looks a little too under powered for me, so I'm not sure. 

I thought I had it all figured out until the Y410p and 510p came out. Now I have no clue what to do. Do I wait for prices to drop a little bit?

Currently I'm using a Dell Vostro, I've had it a little over five years and it's about time to throw in the towel on it.

Example usage: 20 tabs open at the same time and spotify in the background without any slow down at all, one of them being youtube or a site inebriated with flash based ads (ahem easybib/sparknotes). 
Based on previous use, experience and pure conjecture, this would be along the lines of [something scoring around 2100 on this cpu benchmarks chart](http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php), the majority of these are i3's, some i5's, and a mishmash of AMD's. 

Furthermore (and here's the stickler), I would prefer for it to be decently thin and lightweight (one inch thick max, less than 5 pounds) yet still have 4-5 hours of usable battery life. 

I'm decently versed in computers, however I haven't been able to find many sub 14 inch laptops that met my price range while still being decently powerful.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA [freedom]

* Budget range: sub 450, willing to push to 500 if it's worth it

* Purpose ultraportable (I think?)

* Screen size preference: 11-14 inches. preferably 12-13 inches

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I prefer linux, although I'm completely fine with windows 8. Either way, this shouldn't be an issue at all, since I use linux, I'll almost inevitably install it myself. The only foreseeable issue is if the hardware is very obscure and drivers are hard to find. 

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): not many/very low. Tf2, should be playable (at least 30 fps) on normal or low settings

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): multitasking! Also being able to play HD videos (720p) without my CPU maxing out would be nice (unlike my current netbook)

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): me!

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): none, I'm open to all brands.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Thin and lightweight. An ultrabook would be the epitome, although short of a sale, I probably won't get one at my price range (Despite low spec requirements)

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: balanced, I would like low weight, but at least 4 hours battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price: balanced. I can't deny it, I do likes myself a good looking laptop. Of course then I still need to make my price point realistic

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: low noise/heat, but again, at the specs I'm asking for this shouldn't be TOO much of an issue unless it's a really badly made CPU.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: nope. 720 is good enough thanks

* A great keyboard: If it's amazing I might be willing to bump up to the aforementioned 500. I type a lot, between essays, reddit/forums and chat. 

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: no. I wouldn't want a crappy touchpad or mouse buttons, the current ones on my eeepc are absolute crap, they make a crunching sound as I push down (plastic on the sides not aligning all the way), but short of that, as long as they work I'm fine.

* Great audio: no. Nowadays I think you'd be more hard pressed to find a laptop with completely shit speakers than not. I use headphones 95% of the time anyways.

Any Advice is welcome, I am open to looking at other models in the same price range or cheaper and also other suppliers if you know anywehere i could get them cheaper...

Thanks!

Mac book pro retina is looking REALLY appealing, and considering the specs, not too bad value for money.  (it's cheaper than the 13"" sony vaio Z in the UK)  I would prefer a cheaper PC alternative of the same thing, but really, I'm struggling to find it as you can tell.

I'm looking to buy a small, thin, ultrabook. My old Dell laptop has lasted me all through college but it's on its last legs and it's time for an upgrade. I'll be getting a work laptop so this will just be for my personal use (internet, music, movies, etc). I don't play any computer games, so gaming performance isn't a factor. Also, the price isn't much of a factor, but I don't want to just throw money away by overpaying for the same configuration either.

I always thought that Macs were overpriced, but I've been comparing the Air and some similar Windows ultrabooks and the prices are comparable, so I'm leaning towards getting the Air. I've never used OSX for an extended period of time but I'm sure I'll adjust just fine, and just in case I hate it, I can always bootcamp Windows.

Thoughts? I've seen similar questions on this subreddit, but unlike me, everyone is a gamer and the consensus is always that you shouldn't get a Mac for gaming. That doesn't apply to me though.

Also, looking at different configurations, would it be worthwhile to get the i7 processor, or stick with the i5? And in the case of the Air, is it worthwhile to upgrade to 8GB of RAM or stick with 4? I know I don't need the laptop for anything too intensive right now, but I'm also looking to 'future-proof' it a bit, because I'd like it to last a while.

Thanks!!

It seems the main differences are that the Q550LF
- has an i7-4500U (1.8 GHz) instead of the Q501LA's i5-4200U (1.6 GHz).
- has 8GB ram instead of 6GB (and can be expanded to 16 GB instead of 8GB).
- has a 1 TB HDD instead of 750 HDD.
- has an NVIDIA GT 745M (Q501LA has no dedicated GPU).
- has an optical drive (none in Q501LA).
- has a physical power button, whereas the Q501LA incorporates it as a key in the keyboard.
- costs $300 more.

My question is, which one is a better value? How much difference would I see in the different processors? I don't plan on doing heavy gaming; it'd be nice if could play TF2 on an external, but that's more like icing on top.

I know there were a few people here waiting for the system, as it is a much more affordable alternative to the Razer Blade Pro, with similar features.

It features:

* Intel Core i7 4700MQ
* 16GB RAM
* 128GB SSD &amp; 750GB HDD *or* 128GB SSDx2 (RAID 0) 1TB HDD
* Nvidia Geforce GTX 765 w/ 2GB VRAM

* 0.85"" thick &amp; 5.73 lbs
* 6 cell (likely ~60 Whr) battery
* Price $1699 / $1899 (depending on storage)

NCIX's Esther posted a hands on with the system on her youtube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0OFOqnMvHY&amp;feature=youtu.be). The system is made from mostly brushed aluminum, so it has fairly decent construction, and features a SteelSeries keyboard that's above average for laptop keyboards. Thankfully, unlike the GT70, they included dual cooling fans, so the cooling performance should be better than the other MSI models. For those looking for a nicely portable system that still has a large screen and a decent GPU, this is a pretty attractive choice.

I imagine XoticPC will likely have it up this week (or even today) for those looking to customize the system (i.e. custom storage / proccesor).

I'm shying away from the 17"" models because the resolution is the same as the 15"" version, and portability / battery life are not entirely unimportant.

From what I see the only difference between the two laptops are that the NP 8230 has a slightly better graphics card, better audio out, and a few more input/output ports. I was wondering if there was any other differences between the models. Also if people have personal experience with the computers I'd like to hear how people like them!

**Country of purchase:** USA

**Budget range:** up to $600 - less is better

**Purpose:** Linux box, word processing, listening to small collections of music, small coding projects, running multiple applications simultaneously (such as web, word processor, and music)

**Screen size preference:** ~11.6 in - I know I can expand my horizons by going bigger, but I ride a motorcycle and carry stuff in a backpack. Bigger is not better in this scenario.

**OS preference:** I'm going to put a homebrew Linux distro on it, so it doesn't matter

**Gaming requirements:** I might be interested in putting GW2 or a lightweight game on it, but it is primarily intended for school work while in class so this is more of a wish than a need. Low graphics mode in GW2 is fine as I'm no graphics whore.

**Performance requirements:** The most intensive thing it will ever be required to do is probably kernel compilation.

**Brand preferences and reasons:** Asus and Lenovo. Previously owned both and know both to provide good customer service and a reliable machine.

**Any particular style that you like:** Rugged is better. A convertible would be nice, but that probably requires sacrificing the ruggedness.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)**

**Long battery life -vs- Low weight:** Battery

**Build quality -vs- Low price:** balanced? I suppose build quality would ultimately take precedent

**Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:** Performance

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

**High resolution screen:** No

**A great keyboard:** No, though I do prefer the chiclet style keyboard

**A great touchpad/mouse buttons:** No

**Great audio:** No, I use turtle beach headphones

**List any features that are critical:** USB drives, possibly an HDMI port (it would be nice, but won't break the deal) and.... I think that is all.

Overall I feel like I'm pretty easy going considering my requirements on a new laptop. I'd like something rugged and small that I can (gently) throw in my backpack to take to school. I'm not going to be putting a lot of serious demands on it apart from compiling small code projects and/or a custom linux kernel. I don't mind weight or a little heat/noise in exchange for a little more power.

Locally I've been looking at the Asus Q200E and the Lenovo Twist (which is a touch out of my price range, but maybe I'll save a bit and shoot for that). I'm looking to buy online. I'd like to hear opinions on these two as well as new recommendations.

Thanks for the help.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

*Country of purchase:

USA

*Budget range:

Around $500, less is better.

*Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.):

Ultraportable preferably. For use in the Philippines. Mostly for office work - writing, email, video chat, etc. And video streaming for when I'm bored.

*Screen size preference:

11-13 inches

*OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):

I'm comfortable with any OS. Windows *may* be best, only because I've read that some of the ISPs in the Philippines use USB routers that require installing software. I'm unsure if Linux will be able to work around that, I guess it depends on the type of USB router they use. Then again, I probably won't be able to afford that and will have to rely on WiFi in the city and such. I'm unsure.

*Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):

None, really. I'll miss my video games, but I'm not going there to play video games.

*Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):

Hm... a smooth performance. No redrawing windows, for example, but likely nothing major. It needs to be reliable the 2 years I'm there.

*Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):

Self support.

*Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility):

I currently own a Macbook Pro but I'll likely leave it at home. I have no loyalty to Apple, and their products are out of my (small) budget. It's the only laptop I've owned, though, so I'd like some suggestions. I've built my own desktops since high school.

I've used Lenovo in the past, and have been looking at some of their models.

*Any particular style that you like (examples are great):

Well the aluminum bodies of the Macbooks are nice. And the keyboard is pretty good. The Surface Pro looks like something I would love to use (I've always liked tablet computers.), but it is out of my price range. The Samsung Chromebook looks neat. (Also I'd probably get the Chromebook if I wasn't worried about it's usefulness without Internet and printing...though I'm unsure how much I'll need to print when I don't have access to another computer.)

*Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

*Long battery life -vs- Low weight:

Low weight

*Build quality -vs- Low price:

Balanced...though with my budget low price is probably more realistic.

*Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

Low noise/heat

*Would you pay a premium for something that has:

*High resolution screen:

*  I don't care about the retina display either.

Battery life isn't as high of concern, with power available in the server room and my netbook to supplement at other times.

I realise that my requirements list closest fits a gaming laptop. I'm alright with that, as long as it's not too flashy and look way out of place in the boardroom (covered in blue LEDs might be a bit much).

The sidebar strongly suggests I fill this out, so here it is.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**
 
* Country of purchase: US
 
* Budget range: $1500-$2000
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Desktop Replacement
 
* Screen size preference: 16"", but 17"" is OK. My last laptop was an HP HDX16, and that was almost the perfect size (though far too flimsy and plastic).
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Prefer Windows 7, though will dual boot with Gentoo
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Gaming isn't a priority, but a good graphics card is nice
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Must be able to handle 4 to 6 virtual machines, each with a moderate to heavy load
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): Not terribly particular. Not as fond of Apple products, but whatever works best

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): **Must** have a ten-key pad, prefer something solid, not flimsy
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Weight isn't a huge issue, and a two hour battery would be adequate (longer would be nicer, though) 
 
* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality. I've had low price before; I'd rather avoid that.
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance. It'll be used in a server room; heat and noise aren't even a consideration
 
**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
 
* High resolution screen: Yes
 
* A great keyboard: Definitely. 
 
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes
 
* Great audio: Not really
 
**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

Memory is a high priority; 12-16 GB would be a minimum, more is nicer (though probably not realistic)

The ability to have two hard drives would be amazing. One SSD for OS, and one massive spinning drive for the VM's and archives would make sense to me.

Immensely prefer windows 7 over 8. If it comes with 8, I'll happily re install 7 on it. It'd be nice if it came with a downgrade licence, but I'll buy a copy of 7 if that's what it takes.

Okay, so heres where I'll write my text post. I am currently a student, and am looking for a very lightweight and clean netbook, but I kind of want a large SSD, 128gb++.

I plan to buy multiple TB hard drives to store all my stuff, if that helps anybody read my mind. 
      
    * Screen size preference: anything below 12 inches really is good. I like the whole ""clean and lightweight"" feel.
     
    * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): um, macs are too expensive for my taste. Windows/Linux I do not mind either, since I'll install the other OS on a separate drive to boot externally if I ever need it ;)
     
    * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Browser games, League of Legends , perhaps old FPS games like Quake, or something a bit newer like Call of Duty 4.
     
    * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):
     
Stated above, I like a big SSD. I'm willing to pay extra money for a good display screen. A lot of windows laptops have the worse screen I can possibly imagine... :(

I'm good with anything, hopefully no thinkpad bulkiness, they are too rugged for my taste!

    * Any particular style that you like (examples are great):
     
Imagine a chromebook + macbook air having a baby. Now this baby is real light and has good enough specs to run lightweight games, all the while booting up to power and running in the matter of seconds (SSD, catch my drift?). If needed, we can give him some clothes( external hard drives) to pimp him up with data.

    * Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
     
    * Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Both.. :p
     
    * Build quality -vs- Low price: Definitely quality over price, but I am no rich man.
     
    * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Mid performance, I have already stated out the basic games i'll be running, low noise/heat is preferred.
     
    **Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
     
    * High resolution screen: definitely, a good screen makes me happy!
     
    * A great keyboard: im an avid typer, so yes, but I don't mind keyboards really, anything works!
     
    * A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Undefinite here!
     
    * Great audio: I have portable amps with IEM's , + classy speakers. I just need it to run nicely into them.

1362279904.0,9,self.SuggestALaptop,19k2sf,Looking for a Laptop $1500 or under. I want it to last longer than 4 years.,9,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/19k2sf/looking_for_a_laptop_1500_or_under_i_want_it_to/,"Hi! I'm looking to buy a new laptop to last me more than 4 years. Reason being that I've never gotten more than 2.5 out of a laptop and it's starting to put a limit to how much I can get done (in school) because they always end up having something wrong with them.

What I want is a laptop with good specs and a brand that is reputable for lasting a long time. My price limit is $1500, I set it so high because I know that if I want it to last a long time it has to have good specs so it can stand up to more intensive programmes in the future.

I use my laptop to do school work (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) and play some casual games. Mainly DoTA2, LoL, Minecraft and some occasional TF2 (reddit is also involved). The laptop I have right now is a [Samsung Q430-11](http://www.cnet.com/laptops/samsung-q430-11/4507-3121_7-34121948.html); it's is still good, but can't hold a charge and is nearing the end of its lifespan 2.5 years after purchase (what a surprise!).

I was looking at Lenovos, because all of the people I've met with them are VERY happy with their ability to last a long time (I've heard 5+ years from my Maths teacher). More specifically, I was looking at the top of the line [U410](http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=C5A2E5E9A88AEE0FD6766480F1FD83F7) (See the stats on the far left column). It's video card is better than my Samsung at the moment, but that really isn't of concern because this (310M) runs everything I play on more than acceptable settings. 

Portability is also a big thing for me since i'll be moving it around campus every hour or so and it needs to be able to lock and resume quickly so I can get on with what I was doing. Battery life also falls under this category. It needs to last at least 5 hours every day (because I don't use it every period), what I've found from my research on the U410 is that once you install some of the bloatware, you can get up to 5.5 hrs of continuous usage (youtube streaming and web surfing - i.e: redditing), which is ample. So any suggestions should have some good battery life.

So, **TL;DR:** I'd like something that'll last for a long time and still be good. It should also be better than the Samsung linked above.

Sorry for the waffle-y post, I just have a lot to think about with this purchase. It also sounds like I've made my mind up on the U410, I haven't, it's just the only one I've actually taken a serious look at.

A lot of gaming power for the price. The SLI configuration provides something like a GTX 670MX + a little more and you also get a nice 1080p screen (buy glossy), 1TB HDD (5400RPM) and Windows OS. Personally, I think the I5 version if a smarter choice.

1360966244.0,9,self.SuggestALaptop,18lrza,13'' Laptop with good battery (looking for less expensive alternative to Macbook Pro),9,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18lrza/13_laptop_with_good_battery_looking_for_less/,"Hey guys,

I'm using my Laptop mostly on vacations to save my photos on it as a vacation backup and to watch some movies on the airplane.
I'd like to use Lightroom on that device and maybe Photoshop (but thats just a bonus)

So what I need is a 13'' Laptop with a high battery life, but it's not easy to find one which has a similar battery life like the newest Macbook Pro 13'' Retina. 

According to notebookcheck.com the Mac can last around 7h while surfing - every other Laptop I looked into had just something around 5h.

So what I'm trying to decide right now is the following:
Should I buy the very expensive MBP for 1700EUR (I want the one with a 256GB SSD) and hope for a high reselling value on ebay? 
I checked the prices for 2 year old Macbooks and as far as I've seen you're loosing around 200EUR every two years. So while the start price is very high I could hope for a new laptop every two years by just adding 200EUR to my initial price.
You can check this on [heise.de for the prices in germany (look for the ""Gebrauchtpreis"" if interested)](http://www.heise.de/mac-and-i/produkte/macbook-pro/#produktliste)

The alternatives would be (hopefully) laptops in the 600EUR range - which I believe won't have a as near as good reselling value. I couldn't find a similar page for Lenovos for example like the heise.de page.

I'm not sure if thats even a good idea to look at the reselling value. I just heard it from a lot of Apple lovers that they're just buying every two years a new Macbook without loosing a lot of money.

I could get the student rabatt, which means I'd have to pay around 1500EUR for the 1700EUR model. I'm not sure what I'd get after two years (or maybe after next year... I don't know when it's the best time to sell a MBP)

I wouldn't buy a Apple device just because it's an apple. But I couldn't find a good 13'' Laptop with a good battery. What I really don't like about the MBP is that they don't have a Ethernet port, just with the stupid expensive adapter :\

My MBP has developed an infuriating bug where it will ""forget"" that it has wifi hardware for days at a time, effectively rendering it useless as a mobile computer which, as a grad student, I absolutely need.  So here's what I need:

* a decent i7/graphics card combo, I do literally everything but game (music production, video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling, office stuff, etc.)

* Under 1"" thick

* 1080P 15"" screen (I have a 24"" external monitor so I could get away with 14"", but 15 is preferable, I do lots of graphics work so the higher res is mandatory)

* User replaceable hard drive/memory (this is why I don't have the new MBP already)

* No optical drive OR an optical drive that can be replaced with another hard drive 

* Excellent build quality, I'm going to be hauling this all over creation for the next two years and can't have it falling apart, metal construction a huge bonus.

Just got this and thought the community would appreciate some comments about it. I'll keep it simple: 

**Windows 8**

Good:

* Once you get used to the new start menu tile interface, you learn to appreciate it. It's actually fairly helpful. It is easy to add or remove tiles, and you can now completely uninstall programs by simply right clicking the tile.

* People have been commenting about unwanted ads in their tiles. This is hype. They are just some default programs that are a little annoying and can be easily removed. 

Bad:

*  The interface is weird. It seems like they took Windows 7 and said ""Hey we want to do this tile thing, let's just mash it all together and pretend it's a new operating system."" You spend most of your time in a normal-looking desktop, and the only difference is that your start menu is replaced with their stupid tile interface.

* Performance. If they were actually good programmers, they could do more with less. Instead, they have more features but at the cost of performance. I will never use 90% of the new features, but I still need extra RAM because Windows said so.

Overall: Except the start menu, it's pretty much the same as windows 7. It's a new windows system. Deal with it. Or, format and install something else.

**Screen**

* The touch interface is extremely accurate. I'll probably still get a stylus, but I'm really impressed with the multi-touch functions. (Yay for multiplayer MS Paint!)

* The screen is full 1080P, and it looks really crisp. The brightness is good too (decent visibility in daylight). The specs don't mention an anti-glare coating, but it's less reflective than my old laptop. 

**Performance**

* CPU power:

For work purposes, I tested it by using some fluid dynamic simulations. It's not as fast as my desktop (duh) but I was very impressed with the speed of computations. It's more than enough for word processing, and just right for engineers who run complex code while working from coffee shops.

* Graphics

Rendering is way different than running code, so I played a few games to test that. I can smoothly play borderlands 2 at medium settings, and the framerate was still good during complex action sequences. I wouldn't recommend it for Far Cry 3. (again, duh)

Kerbal space program also runs great.

**Physical**

It's 0.8 inches thick. Looks like a macbook. I was very impressed by the physical design and layout.

Fan runs great, didn't make my dick hot.

Lacks a numpad :(

Advertised 5 hour battery life is actually dead-on. (Unless you're trying to run Far Cry 3)

No DVD drive. But I never use those anyway.

The screen completely unfolds to lay flat, but it doesn't fold all the way around to become a tablet. God only knows why they didn't spend an extra 5 minutes and $2 to add that feature.

**Overall**

It cost $1400 because of the touch screen. If I wasn't a fucking lunatic I would have skipped the touch screen and got more power.

Here's the thing: I've never seen a laptop that was even close to a MacBook Pro in terms of overall design and general feel. 

The specific features that I would not compromise on:

* Large, single-button, multitouch trackpad. 

* Sturdy, solid, sleek case. Preferably aluminum. I really, really want to avoid plastic. 

* Must have FireWire or ports that are compatible with FireWire. 

I know Apple gets a lot of hate on reddit, and I agree with nearly all the points. I don't even run Mac OS X very often. But I haven't found a laptop that's as good as the MacBook Pro. 

Obviously I can buy a laptop with comparable technical specifications for considerably cheaper. But, to me, that is not at all what a laptop is about. I spend so much time on my laptop that I'm willing to spend a good chunk of money on design and comfort. The trackpad especially; I actually prefer it to a mouse unless I'm gaming. 

So is it true that the extra money you pay for a MacBook is just for a shiny logo? Or is there actually another laptop that can compete with the MacBook Pro for significantly cheaper, and *not* just on CPU, RAM and HDD size, but on a design level as well?

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase:
USA

* Budget range:
$1650 is the preferable max, obviously pushing it a few dollars is okay.

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.):
Mostly gaming, some schoolwork/programming

* Screen size preference:
My old one was 17.3"" and was fantastic, so I'd like it to be 17.3"" (or similar sized) again.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):
Windows

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):
Skyrim, Metro 2033, Saints Row 3, Crysis 2 on High while being smooth, preferably.

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):
?

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):
?
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility):
Currently own a Sager that has worked great, but no loyalty to them. Whatever works best.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):
Not really.

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
Long battery life -vs- Low weight:
Long Battery, as weight doesn't matter since it essentially acts as a desktop.
* Build quality -vs- Low price:
Build quality.
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:
As long as there aren't overheating issues, then I prefer performance. I mostly play in my room so noise isn't an issue.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
* High resolution screen:
Yes 
* A great keyboard:
No, keyboard does not really matter to me.
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons:
No. Have external mouse.
* Great audio:
Sure, audio is important for gaming, especially online FPS like CSS.

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

Prefer glossy screen, would like it to be able to read DVDs. An HDMI port would nice.



Some background, I ordered a Sager NP9170 but it had overheating issues (was reaching 95C after 5 minutes of normal gaming). Therefore, now I am looking for alternatives. I'm fine with looking at another NP9170 without the AMD Radeon 7970m, as that is the video card that was overheating. Alternatively, I'm open to any brand, as long as I am not paying ridiculous amounts of money just for the brand name. Thanks for the help!
Let me know if you have any question.

**Edit for clarity**: The NP9170 is only 2 days old but I am *potentially* returning it for a full refund, depending on what people advise. I would try repasting the GPU to reduce heat issues, but it's an expensive brand new laptop and I don't think I want to risk it overheating in the future. The problem only seems to be happening with my exact setup - NP9170 with an AMD Radeon 7970m HD graphics card.

Games I'll be wanting to play are Diablo 3 (if the internet there is capable), Shogun: Total War, Civilization 5, Batman: Arkham City, The Witcher 2, WoW, and maybe Guild Wars 2... I suppose these are mostly high-end games.

So right now, I'm looking at the HP dv6tqe, it seems to fit my budget and my needs well (that being a sturdy, well-built gaming laptop that will survive the heat and dust), however I am **not** dead-set on this laptop and if anyone else has any other suggestions, I'll happily consider them (I am a big fan of ASUS).

Okay so, barring that, I'm at the HP Official Store and I'm trying to customize my laptop, but there are a few items on here that I'm not too sure about, so I was hoping some of you guys could shed some light on some of these items.

* So the standard processor is the i7-3610QM @ 2.3GHz. However, the i7-3720QM @ 2.6GHz is a $175.00 upgrade, which, while that is a lot of money, it is something I could technically afford.

* The hard drive that comes with this is a 1 TB 5400RPM. However, for $20 I can change that to a 750GB 7200RPM. I believe a fast hard-drive  is very helpful for games like WoW and Guild Wars 2. Worth it?

* 32 GB Hard Drive Accelerator Cache for $50. I don't really know how good this is. Apparently though, it's available for the 1TB 5400RPM drive, but not the 750GB 7200RPM drive, giving me the error ""32GB mSSD Hard Drive Acceleration Cache requires purchase of non-Solid State or Hybrid Hard Drive."" Apparently the 7200RPM drive is a hybrid?

* The standard display is 1366x768, and an upgrade to 1920x1080 is $150. I know this is probably a good investment, however $150 is a lot, so I'm wondering if anyone has any opinions to cement my decision.

* There doesn't seem to be an option to upgrade the processor's thermal paste on the official store. If heat is going to be an issue, this would be highly recommended, wouldn't it? If HP doesn't offer this option, is it easy for me to do myself? Or should I not worry about it?

* There's a Cooling Mat here for $40. I'm sure I could find another one for $20 elsewhere. Is there any reason why I would get the $40 one?

I am very appreciative of any advice you guys can offer. Thank you!

6) What are the primary tasks will you be performing with this notebook?
Gaming, TV/ movie streaming, typing papers, various college stuff.

7) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places, leaving it on your desk or both?
Taking it around campus, sitting on the desk.

8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so, please state which games or types of games?
I'd like to play Skyrim, Fallout, Borderlands, Minecraft, etc. Obviously the better the graphics and performance, the better. I'm not the type to max out though, and medium settings are fine.

Don't really know. Average is fine. The more the better, but it isn't a big deal.

10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?
Online is cool. Pictures are good for me.

Windows 7

12) What screen resolution(s) would you prefer? 
1920 X 1080 is good.

Matte, but I don't think the y580 comes in that.

A tiny bit.

Soon.

16) How long do you want this laptop to last?
A few years.

A decent amount of storage. I'd like at least 32GB of SSD though.

18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a DVD Burner, Blu-ray Reader or Blu-Ray Burner?
Just a regular DVD burner.

I'm just a bit interested in the y580. Obviously I am open to other options. ",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_v5se4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/v5se4/i_am_looking_at_the_lenovo_y580_but_open_to_other/,

What I'm most interested in is a good quality display, 1080p, preferably 13-14in; a decent graphics card, preferably Nvidia; and no optical drive. The new MBP really is pretty close to what I want except it's a little expensive and I want to run Linux. Also I'd rather not support Apple any more.

- Budget isn't really an issue, but preferably less than $1500us. 
- Preferably 13"" but I realize the specs I want don't come in that size very often.
- I definitely don't want something big and heavy. I use it mostly at home, but I like to be able to move it around.
- I'm in Japan but I will probably order it in the US because it's cheaper and I don't want to end up with an awful keyboard.
- As much battery as possible but that's not a huge priority.
- I want to run blender and have things render quick.
- Something that will last, I tend to keep my laptops a long time.

Is the MBP my only option in the near future?

Hi all. This is my second try here. Per your advice several months ago, I've been waiting quite some time for Haswell-imbued laptops to come along, but I can wait no longer: I need a laptop by **September 1**.

I'll be using it mainly for **grad school** (statistical software + a bit of programming, writing papers, many many browser tabs open simultaneously) and **some light gaming** on the side (Left 4 Dead, GTA4, Mass Effect, Medieval Total War II -- i.e., nothing *too* graphics intensive). 

Key features I'm interested in: 

- I'd like **more than 6.5 hours** of battery life.
-  Something that weighs less than **5 lbs**. I want something easy to carry! (15.6"" is the biggest I'd go. However, I don't want anything too small, either - I think 13"" is the minimum screen I'd take.) 
- At least **8 GB of RAM**.
- Pretty standard these days, but it's gotta have a **backlit keyboard** and an **integrated webcam**. Keyboard has got to be good for typin', too. 
- I prefer **Windows**.
- 1440 x 900 resolution or better. 1366 x 768 is unacceptable. Ideally, I'd like something **1920 x 1080** or higher.
- I don't need an optical drive and I don't particularly care about speakers.
- I would prefer an established brand, if possible (e.g., Asus, Acer, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba). Open to other suggestions, though. 


Finally, what are your thoughts on ""protection plans""? Worth it, or not worth it? I'm generally pretty careful with my computers, but at the same time, I probably won't be able to flat-out replace my computer-to-be if something happens to it. That said, these plans can add $200-$300 on to up-front costs. Do you guys normally go for it?

I realize that the keyboard could be an issue, seeing as I would be missing a few letters, but I'm fairly sure it's possible to obtain it from the company itself, if not from the distributor.

Mildly Portable
-------------------
I need a laptop that I can carry to college almost every single day, so it has to be reasonably portable; I can handle up to 6 pounds, but no 8 pounds crap, please keep it practical if not fully convenient. A high battery life is must, around 4 to 5 hours of medium usage e.g.-surfing the web on min. brightness.

Extreme Gaming
-------------------
FOR ONCE I just want a laptop that's not going to compromise the GPU and CPU for mobility. The CPU should preferably be a quad-core, but again it's not a deal-breaker if it isn't. GPU on the other hand, I can't stress this enough... I NEED IT TO BE UNBEATABLE, lag should be NON-EXISTENCE from anything on the native resolution of 1920x1080 and anything from 2011 and before should play on Ultra. Sure, Crysis 3 or Witcher 2 I might need to lower the settings down a notch, but I still need playable FPS for such demanding games for at least a year after my purchase. Nvidia or AMD, doesn't really matter, but I strongly implore nothing lower Nvidia the GeForce GTX 650 series and for AMD the Radeon HD 7970, as the tests show even these present some unfortunate FPS reductions for demanding games. Keep in mind that gaming is it's primary function.

Other Desirable Features
----------------------------
Reliable and Durable: I don't want to contact customer support or change any parts at all for the first year at least... fine, the first 6 months.
Heating Issues: Never above 90F. Okay, sure noise emissions are acceptable during gaming and heating up at the vents is completely understandable, but I shouldn't be able to feel too hot or comfortable when touching the keyboard, touch-pad or palm rest.
Design and build quality: I want it to look half-decent and presentable, nothing too fancy, I'd just like a sturdy feel; no cheap plastic feel like what's underneath the msi GE series (almost unapproachable).

So to sum up -Insanely powerful graphics card
-Possible to carry around without too much trouble 
-Above average battery life 
-Doesn't burn my hands 
-I can trust the screen won't crack I close it too fast like my last hp garbage. 
-Looks ""meh"" 7/10, would bang (Sorry I had to...)

I realize this configuration is not available from Lenovo, I bought it from Newegg.

I bought my laptop from Newegg. Originally, I had ordered it from Lenovo on June 26th. They sent me an email with the shipping information and it said it would ship on July 11th. On July 10th I checked the website to check if maybe it shipped early or something but it still said July 11th. July 11th and I check to make sure it has shipped. They changed the ship date to July 23rd and receive date to July 25th. WTF? I call up Lenovo trying to work something out and try to get it earlier. The first guy tried to tell me that on July 4th their servers crashed and all the orders got messed up and it caused a huge delay and he tells me he can't do anything about it. So then I searched around and found the model no available on Newegg (it was not available when I originally ordered) and I call them to make sure they have them in stock. They tell me that they have about 40 scattered across different warehouses. Then I call back Lenovo hoping for better luck trying to get it earlier and if not then canceling. This guy tells me that they just haven't been able to meet demand and that they haven't been getting enough shipments instead of giving me some BS story. Now, I was angry at this point so I just canceled my order and then proceeded to order from Newegg for ~$300 cheaper and no tax. Then after ordering I realized that this model does not have an SSD and half the RAM. Just an anecdote to warn whoever is buying directly from Lenovo.

So, any questions?

Note: I do not have any benchmarks or exact battery live numbers.

EDIT: So I just thought I would go ahead and post the things that I have noticed about the laptop.

* It has a pretty hard edge, if you type or game for long periods of time the area around your wrists will hurt and probably will also have marks on them. Unless you type at a desk and use proper posture and stuff like that.

* Top gets fingerprints, trackpad gets fingerprints, even the keyboard gets fingerprints!

* Trackpad sucks, it's one of those trackpad/button combos.

* Keyboard is fine for the most part, although I had the same keyboard on my previous laptop.

* Speakers are phenomenal for a laptop.
 
* I've been playing GTA IV, Garry's Mod, Chivalry, and Trials Evolution. All seem to run great.
 
* Graphics takes a huge performance hit when playing on battery, anyone know how to disable this?

* Trackpad sucks.

* Display is great coming from a 14"" 1366 x 768 screen.

* Windows 8 is bearable with StartIsBack

* Did I mention the trackpad?

EDIT2: Thought I should mention a couple of things regarding the SLI.

So the battery life with SLI is good for about 4 hours. You cannot switch to integrated graphics while the Ultrabay card is physically in the machine. You have to manually pull it out and only then it allows you to use integrated graphics. It lets you disable SLI without pulling out the card but it doesn't let you switch t integrated.

I've been wanting to get a computer with a SSD, and my friends are telling me to just get a Mac and put all the VMs I want on it. But is it really worth the price tag if I'll be using Linux most of the time anyways? What Mac-exclusive features would I be missing out on?

    * Country of purchase: USA
     
    * Budget range: $2000 tops
     
    * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Portability would be nice because it'll be my college computer, but performance is definitely the biggest factor since I'll be doing lots of graphics work and I want to be able to run VMs.
     
    * Screen size preference: No smaller than 13"". I have a 15"" laptop now, but I'll be buying a second monitor for when I need the extra space.
     
    * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): None, although I haven't used Mac in a long while and the interface thoroughly confuses me now. :P If I did get Windows, the very first thing I would do is partition the drive and put Linux on it because I refuse to program in Windows... I suppose I could do a Windows VM? Anyone here tried that? I can't go 100% without either Windows or Mac because I need some of the software, like Microsoft Office (LibreOffice doesn't cut it!)
     
    * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): None, I'm not a gamer.
     
    * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Adobe Suite is a big one. I also have to visualize some pretty hefty datasets (global atmospheric data), so I'm working with files that can be as much as a GB.
     
    * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self mostly. I've done a moderate amount of tinkering (the scariest being the first time I partitioned the hard drive in order to dual boot my computer...) and I haven't broken anything major yet...
     
    * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I have an HP laptop, but honestly I've used quite a few laptops, mine and other people's, and I've never encountered one that was truly AMAZING. 
     
    * Any particular style that you like (examples are great): On my current laptop, the volume is controlled by swiping across a touch controlled volume bar, and the sensor has gotten really wonky... I don't know if this is a feasible feature to ask for any more, but I like physical BUTTONS either on the keyboard or on the side to control things. I'm not a fan of Mac keyboards, either, but I think that's just a layout issue, and I'd probably get over it after some time using it.
     
    * Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
     
    * Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Balanced. 
     
    * Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality.
     
    * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance
     
    **Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
     
    * High resolution screen: Eh, maybe. Not essential.
     
    * A great keyboard: Maybe. 
     
    * A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Maybe.
     
    * Great audio: Not essential, I have speakers to hook up to when I want better sound quality.
     
    **List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) HDMI/VGA for external monitor, at least 2 USB ports. I also don't know if this is a thing, but is there such a thing as a screen that doesn't smudge as much? That's a big problem right now...

also, i already have an ssd that is currently installed in the mac, would it be possible to reformat it for this ultrabook and install it?

1373901590.0,7,self.SuggestALaptop,1icdmk,Acer Aspire V7 482PG First Impressions,7,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1icdmk/acer_aspire_v7_482pg_first_impressions/,"So I got this a few days ago for 41900NT, which is around $1400. Yeah, I live in Taiwan; not sure if this laptop is out in the US yet. Since I can't find any real reviews for it, I figured I'd post here. 

The 482PG is the 14"" model. There is the 582PG (15.6""), which, from the store I bought mine at, can be had for the same price with the same specs (besides weight and size, I guess). My configuration has the i7 4500U (1.8GHz), 8GB RAM, GT750m 4GB, 1080P IPS Touchscreen monitor, 1TB (WD Blue, not sure about speed) HDD w/ 20GB SSD cache, Win 8.

1. The **screen** is quite nice. Viewing angles are good from all directions, and colors are vibrant and sharp. The touchscreen is accurate (although I don't use it most of the time). The resolution is obviously nice, although I have run into issues with some programs having blurry text (Steam, Chrome, Slimdrivers, etc). I think this is an issue with Windows 8.
2. The **keyboard** took some getting used to for me, but I think it's just that I've never really used a chiclet extensively before. Other than that, the backlighting is pretty, and the keys are responsive. So pretty good overall.
3. On the other hand, the **trackpad** sucks, in my opinion... It doesn't feel as sensitive as it could be. But that's OK. The worst thing is the clicking, with those integrated style buttons that just feel wrong and often move the cursor just as you're clicking. Almost makes me want to use the touchscreen more (I would, if I didn't have a mouse).
4. **Build quality** wise, I'm not sure if I'm professional or experienced enough to comment, but from what I can tell, it is pretty sturdy. It's a sleek looking machine, although if you're looking for a unique look, this is not the laptop for you (probably shouldn't be buying an Acer anyway...). The bottom and screen edges are rubberized, so it's not all slippery aluminum or something. It's heavy for an ultrabook, but still pretty slim and light in my books. The lack of an optical drive doesn't make that much of a difference. The ports, which are mostly located in the back (only 2 USB 2.0, headphone jack, and an SD reader on the sides), can be inconvenient. Also, reaching the insides (RAM, mostly) is kind of a hassle. You have to remove the entire backplate, which involves removing at least 10 screws; there is no ""easy access"" hatch. 
5. In terms of **performance**, I expected more... but maybe my expectations were too high. Booting up is really fast, as is general usage of the computer, though that's kind of a given. I played Guild Wars 2, and ended up having to lower the resolution to 1600x900 because it just couldn't handle it well at 1080p, even with all the settings at lowest (besides subsambling, which is essentially lowering the resolution). The fps would be in the 20s usually, which is kind of playable, but not really acceptable for me, especially when I would see single digits in intense fights. At 1600x900, I have most settings on medium, and average in the 40s, which is pretty good to me. I understand that GW2 is pretty CPU heavy, so I'm looking to try out other games. Still, I wish I could put the full HD to use. 

Overall, I would say that I made a hasty purchase, and maybe should have waited for the Gigabyte P35K or P34G. This is by far not a *bad* computer; it just doesn't suit my needs as well as I hoped it would (gaming).

So I need a school laptop for coding, I got a good computer at home but apparently it is ""Highly recommended"" to have a laptop for my education. It will be used for coding and writing (in that order) and maybe it is good enough to play a game like FTL.

I will ask someone if I really really need one and will then make the decision of buying one.

[Link](http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cdetland.to?poid=2000098991)

Pros:

* The speakers sound gorgeous over the whole range of sound
* The laptop itself looks very nice, the case doesn't smudge and it feels sturdy
* The keyboard is great to type on, it gives a satisfying click but is still quiet
* Played League of Legends on all max settings and it ran at a comfortable 40 to 50 fps
* The laptop feels very responsive, and the boot time  from off to running programs is quite fast
* The screen resolution is great (1600 x 900) and programming on this machine will be much easier than my previous 1368x768 laptop.


Cons:

* The laptop was damaged upon arrival, pressing down on the case of the laptop to the right of the trackpad and below the numberpad causes it to turn off. I contacted Toshiba support and they were more than willing to replace it, no questions asked.

* The function keys default to secondary, requiring Fn to press them. While this was reversible with a bios switch, it took googling to figure out bios mode in windows 8

* The laptop got a little warm during regular use on my lap, however providing space directly under the fan cooled it off in 5 minutes or less. The temperature didn't increase significantly during a LoL game. The ambient room I'm in is around 82 degrees which could play a factor in the heat.

* The trackpad could not be considered ideal, which was somewhat expected, as most of the laptops I was looking at had this issue.


-----------

Overall:

I would personally give this laptop a 9.5 out of 10, after the replacement arrives. Others less comfortable with changing the settings in BIOS could have a lower score, or users with a heavy trackpad dependence.

I do a lot of blogging and writing as a (as pathetic as it sounds) aspiring comedian. My mentor bought me a screenwriting software called Final Draft that I need to install and use frequently, so must have an Optical Drive and good performance for long hours of writing.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Country of purchase:** Unites States of America

* **Budget range:** $600-$800, MAX $900

* **Purpose:** mostly a desktop replacement, with some multimedia entertainment, but no gaming. 

* **Screen size preference:** about 14-16 inches

* **OS preference:** either Windows 8 or 7. I have heard 8 is obnoxious and especially annoying if you don't have a touchscreen. And I was a fan of the classic ""start"" menu. I don't know, I'd say 8 if you recommend a touch screen and 7 if not? I will defer to expert opinions on this.

* **Gaming requirements:** I am not a gamer at all so I don't think this applies to me.

* **Performance requirements:** I won't be gaming and I don't do graphic design or programming, but I'd still like it to be fast for watching streaming/dvd videos, for video recording/editing, and for writing in Final Draft.

* **Method of computer support:** Self support

* **Brand preferences and reasons:** I don't truly have a preference but I have been hearing good things about Lenovo recently and I think they are having a big 4 of July sale right now.

* **Any particular style that you like:** well I like either black or brushed metal for color. Is that the style it means?

*Which of the following qualities would you prefer?*

* **Build quality -vs- Low price:** balanced

* **Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:** almost balanced leaning just slightly to performance

Location is Netherlands, it will not be used for gaming. Mostly buying it for portability, and Macbook Air is king in that. Battery life is a big plus, and with the new update to the Air this also seems to be king.

I am aware that there must be multiple ultrabooks around this pricepoint that can rival the Air, but I'm at a loss as to what these would be.

If anyone can point a few out that would be great, don't worry about linking to EU/NL retailers. I should be able to do all of that myself.

One final thing is that its possible for her to get the Air for US prices, wich makes it a very attractive option.

Y500: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834312439

Well, I'm caught between two laptops right now. Getting close to pulling the trigger, but I'm caught. I'm looking for people who have personal experience with the Y500 (I know someone with a G46VW, so I can use it and test it myself).

G46VW- 

PROS: Small (14""), upgradable (Not by the user, according to a quick google), cheaper (by about $200), decent battery life, personal like of the keyboard, good cooling (for a laptop, huge plus), single GPU (which will probably get overclocked because of the cooling), quiet.

CONS: Small (14""), i5&lt;i7, matte screen (I like colors and bright things), screen is dim, only a 768p screen, no keypad, part of me dislikes the design.



Y500

PROS: i7 2.4GHz, larger HDD(1TB as apposed to 750GB), larger in general (15.6""), 1080p screen, gloss finish, better graphics card performance, better interior design (keyboard and such), better sound (supposedly), better card reader, THAT ULTRABAY ;D

CONS: Heat issues (gets uncomfortable to the user to game, can also reach 90C+ with extremely intense games like FC3), more expensive(by $200), heat from the SLIed card blows out toward the right hand (my mouse hand), MICROSTUTTERS FROM THE SLI (cannot stand microstutter), awful touchpad (not that big of a deal), NO OPTIMUS (horrid battery life).

Right now I'm leaning towards the Y500 because it's more powerful overall, it's larger, I liked red lights, and 1080p. However, if what people say about the microstutter from the SLI is true, I'll dump it in a heartbeat. Same somewhat applies to the heating issue, though that can get fixed/can be avoided (not the getting hot air tossed at my hand part.

Thanks for replies before hand, reddit.

EDIT: I'm extremely open to suggestions, however no Alienware, HP, or Dell. I've been burned there multiple times.

I was hoping to pick something else up for the basics of the writing part of what I do. As such, my top four requirements are:

1. as nice a keyboard as can be had.
2. as light a machine as can be had. 
3. a screen that won't make my eyes bleed.
4. a battery that'll last at least 4 hours on a charge.

I'm not beholden to any particular OS, so that's not as important. So long as I can stick a Dropbox folder on the thing, I'll be set. I'll install as basic and no-frills a text editor as I can, and then, to business. 

Here're some more details about me/what I need:

* I'm in the US.
 
* Budget range: Under $300 optimally, no more than $400.
 
* Purpose: writing, mobility.
 
* Screen size preference: &lt;13''

Thanks!

My son and his friends (preteens/teens) love playing minecraft.  One of the boys would pack up his 5 year old all-in-one and lug it around when it wasn't his turn to have the group over at his house.  Well one morning taking him home I put his luggage (it only carried his computer) in my trunk and when I pulled it out It was heavier than I expected and cracked the screen against the side of my trunk.  

My dilemma is this: 1.  I owe this really nice kid a computer that works and works as well as the one I broke.  2. I'm pretty good at picking out computers if I have months to wait for the one I want to go on sale...but I am not going to make this kid wait half the summer for his computer. 3.  I have no idea what will be good enough to replace what he lost and at the same time fit my non-existent budget.  



**TLDR:** need help finding a laptop (or pc) that will run minecraft and replace a 5 year old all-in-one for as little as possible (I need to find the balance between $ and function.)

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA (North Carolina)

* Budget range: - **No budget - have to make my mistake right for as little as possible.  Will have to buy on credit and work to pay it off.**

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.):  **Replace 5 year old lenovo all-in-one**

* Screen size preference: 

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): **Windows**

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):  **Minecraft**  (I don't know what other games they play although I know he has games on a steam account.)

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): The only other thing I'm sure of is they watch youtube vids of people playing minecraft.  

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): **Would prefer they have easy access to customer support but isn't requirement.**

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility):  **None** - have been looking at all options including refurbished and off-lease to try and get the best quality for the money.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):  **The kids are 13 as long as it is not PINK and plays the games I don't think they care.**

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: **Neither or Balanced**

* Build quality -vs- Low price:  **Need to balance quality vs. price**

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: **Balanced**

One last thing, this kid is a good kid and completely understood it was an accident.  He doesn't expect me to replace his computer even though he is devastated that it is broken (his parents warned him about lugging around his all-in-one).  That doesn't mean I wan't to give him something that isn't going to work well just because the price-tag is right.  I really need to find the balance between $ and function (and quickly)...hopefully that is where your expertise will help.  

Thanks for any and all help!

I've only heard of sager and xotic recently in this subreddit and I can't help but be nervous about purchasing from them. I ran across some pretty awful custom service reviews for Sager, but all of xotic's customer reviews seem to be very good. It looks like the bad sager reviews were linked to people who bought directly from Sager rather than a reseller, like xotic.
On the other hand, I would likely get a Lenovo Y500 if not a Sager, and I have heard pretty bad things about their customer service as well. I'm pretty lost...

I've been looking at the $200 Acer Chromebook and the $250 Samsung Chromebook, trying to decide if I should go ahead and get one.

I plan on working here for the next four years at least, so I want a laptop that will be able to keep up with games for as long as possible. 

What I have determined to be essential items (feel free to comment on). Obviously when an upgrade is within budget, then that would be optimal.

Screen size: &gt;17in

CPU: i7-3630QM

GPU: nVidia GeForce GTX 675MX 4,096MB

There's nothing worse than buyers remorse for me, hence, the tedious research I've been doing so far. The future use my laptop is going to require high performance in is going to be broken down to approx:

30% CAD usage

20% Programming(beginners)

35% chilling watching movies and online lectures

15% gaming (eg. Oblivion, Call of Duty).

I've been frantically trying to find that 15R laptop with the specs I think I need at around the 17R price ($860) or cheaper.

One of the specs that bottlenecks the prices typically from $500 to $850 is the 1920 x 1080 screen resolutions. I've been discriminating against the laptops that have the 1388X768 and the 1600X900 resolutions in reaction to user [edit1754's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1cnrra/quick_pick_guides/c9i9j9m) very adamant claim that the 1080p res is totally worth it.

I'm kind of leaning towards the newegg one... aside from the fact that it has Windows 8 on it :/ Would they load Win7 on it instead if I asked?

My budget is fairly flexible, about $2200 would be as high as I would be willing to go, cheaper is always good too though. Looking for something that I'm not going to have to upgrade very soon. 

I was looking at some of the Asus g75 laptops, they seem really nice but I'm not exactly sure I need something that powerful, just feeling overwhelmed. Being able to play games on high detail would be amazing. Have always had to play on minimum details on my current laptop.

A large screen and heavier weight are not an issue since I will only be moving the laptop once or twice a month. A quality screen would be nice too since I watch most of my movies on my laptop.

A good keyboard would be great but the touchpad doesn't matter since I will be using a mouse the entire time.

Value Performance is my #1 concern. I want anything I run to be as fast and smooth as possible. (Hence the desire for at least a cache ssd, which looks like all i can afford) I know the Lenovo's processor and GPU are better than the Dell's, but I'm wondering by how much. Is it worth the extra $120 on an $850 system? I'll gladly sacrifice some graphics quality to play faster, especially on those turns of Civilization. Also, my storage needs are pretty low - I only currently have about 70GB of data total (plus whatever win8 will be), so if there is a way to go all SSD I'm listening.

As far as games go, I mostly am looking to be able to run older RPG's like Morrowind and KOTOR, so I would imagine I don't need a machine that is ***too*** too powerful. Though, if a cheap laptop could play some newer AAA titles I would certainly be down.

Would the Lenovo u410 be able to do this? I'm really not trying to spend more than $800, so if it can't then what similarly priced laptop would be better?

-From my very quick survey of the features, the ONLY downside I see to this is compared to the y580 is the battery life, which is about 3.5 hours using WLAN.

-Take special note of the weight of 5.3 pounds, which is pretty good IMO for all the features that it has.

-I was considering the y580 at first, but if they don't come back...this or the n56vz is definitely the laptop I am getting. The tradeoff for the n56vz is a slightly worse graphics card, weight, and HDD for a moderate increase in battery life and excellent build (both durability and style).",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1362712637.0,,,True,t3_19w183,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/19w183/amazing_laptop_with_very_fair_pricemsi_ge60/,

My 5 year old HP NW series laptop is showing it's age and after using a 1920x1200 lcd for so long, today's laptops that largely ship with wxga, are like going back to a pentium 3 in terms of screen real estate.   
  
So my search has focused in thee main areas.  
1) Normal laptops with a 1080p screen.   
2) Ultrabooks with a 1080p screen  
3) Buying a low resolution machine and then just swapping out the panel.   
  
Option number one is absurd  - I have only once used the optical drive in my laptop, and a 1080p laptop next to its wxga sibling costs an extra $500. WTF....   

Option number 2 limits me to about six models of ultrabook. None of which are cheap, half of them have glossy touch screens and windows 8 which means the firmware is unlikely to be Linux friendly. The ones with the best specs and a reasonable price, have complaints of the case being super scratch prone. The models that look well built, all have touchscreens and complaints of refusing to work with anything but windows 8.  
  
Option number three... Seriously looks the best.   
I can buy a $500 to $600 ultrabook, make sure it is one that known to work well with dual booting 7 and linux, and then spend another $100 upgrading the screen to full HD.  
   
  
I've swapped higher resolution panels into other laptops with success, so unless there happens to be something specific in this case that causes a problem, this is what I'm expecting to end up doing.

1. 1235$ - [The new CyberPower Fangbook X7-100](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/cyberpower-fangbook-x7-100-gtx-675mx-i7-1080p-windows-deal/) - a 17.3"" gaming laptop packing a lot of features: I7-3630QM, **GTX 675MX**, 8GB DDR3 1600MHZ, 7200RPM 750GB HDD, 1080p screen and Windows OS for 1235$ and you also get a 150$ in-game value gift for several games. Quite a deal and probably the most interesting for a 17.3"" in this price range currently due to the high GTX 675MX performance (+270$ for GTX 680M) and the fact that it comes with a Windows OS.

2. 900$-1025$: [Still the Lenovo Y500 with dual GT 650M GPUs with an I7 and 8GB DDR3 for 1025$](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/lenovo-ideapad-y500-dual-gt-650m-i7-1080p-deal/) or [with an I5 and 6GB DDR3 for 900$](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/lenovo-ideapad-y500-15-6-gaming-laptop-dual-gt-650m-gddr5-i5-3230m-6gb-ddr3-nice-1080p-display-1tb-hdd-for-900/). A lot of gaming power for the price. The SLI configuration provides something like a GTX 670MX + a little more and you also get a nice 1080p screen (buy glossy), 1TB HDD (5400RPM) and Windows OS. Personally, I think the I5 version if a smarter choice.

3. 750$: [The Dell Inspiron 15R SE with 1080p screen, I7-3632QM, Radeon 7730M and more for 750$](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/dell-inspiron-15r-special-edition-i7-7730m-deal/). A really nice deal for a good laptop, although personally the Asus N56DP is more attractive due to the fact it's cool and quiet (but has an AMD A10 and not an I7)

4. [Acer M5-481TG with GT 640M GDDR5 and I5-3317U, 500GB + 20GB mSSD](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/acer-m5-481tg-gt-640m-le-deal/) - thin &amp; light 14.0"" laptop with good gaming capabilities for the price. The battery will hold 6 hours surfing the web through WiFi.

5. [a Really good deal - refurbished Lenovo Y480 with GT 650M, I5, 6GB DDR3](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/lenovo-ideapad-y400-i7-gt650m-deal/) - 14.0"" gaming laptop with a lot of gaming power.

As the title suggests, with the promise of income tax coming upon us, i'm in the market for a new laptop and i have no idea where to begin. so lets go ahead and outline what exactly i'm looking for. 

I'm looking for either a laptop or an ultrabook, but will settle for a netbook if its the only prime choice available. My biggest selling point is screen resolution. I'm not looking for 1080p or above in this price point, although i definitely wouldn't turn it down. the minimum resolution i'm willing to accept is 1440x900, and i highly prefer a 16:10 aspect ratio, although i won't look down on 16:9. 

My price range, as stated in the title, is around $700 dollars. Its to ensure a bit of leeway, but anything under budget is definitely a priority. 

As for my main uses, it'll be for general web browsing and light/mid coding. I have no preference for operating systems. Once I get the laptop i'll be wiping the hard drive and installing a flavor of Linux, so its not really a concern. That being said i do want a bit of power to it, as i'll probably be running steam for linux on it. I won't go into much detail about how much performance i want out of it since its still hard to gauge exactly how each game performs on different PCs, but anything that will net a playable framerate in games like Torchlight 2 and TF2 should be good enough for me. 

Battery life is really important. I travel a lot, which means i don't always have access to outlets. Linux still has a few issues with battery life, but anything that nets 5+ hours with Windows should suffice. 

Weight really isn't an issue, and neither is size, but i would prefer a 13-15 inch laptop. I would also like it to be sturdy, like i mentioned above i travel a lot, and want something that wouldn't fall apart during a bit of rough travel. I do listen to a lot of music, so decent audio is a plus (but i won't pay a premium for things like Beats audio) 

##In case you all were intimidated by this wall of text i'll give the rundown in TL;DR format

**Price Range:** $700-$800 US

**Ideal Resolution:** 1440x900 and above ***ABSOLUTELY NO 1366x768*** If netbooks are my only option then i'll take 1280x800

**Main Uses:** web browsing, light/average coding, maybe some light gaming like Torchlight 2 and TF2 (on low settings of course) 

**Battery Life:** 5+ hours is ideal

**Durability/Portability/Size:** weight and size aren't all that important to me, but ideally i want something between 13inches and 15 inches. It should also be able to take the wear and tear of travel. 

**Operating System:** No preference really, as i'll be wiping the hard drive and installing linux the first chance i get",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_18dufw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18dufw/us_looking_for_a_laptopultrabooknotebook_in_the/,

Please help!",7,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18di6w/pl_need_a_gaming_laptopdesktop_replacement_budget/,"Hello! It's about time to switch out my Acer 5741g for a new laptop, and I've been looking around, trying to find a gaming laptop at a reasonable price. My goal is to allow the laptop to play any games coming out in the next 2 years or so comfortably. 

Sorry for not using the questionnaire - I consider most components I did not mention (specifics of laptop build, keyboard/touchpad, noise, etc) of neglible importance. The laptop is essentially meant as a desktop replacement - I'd build a proper PC if I didn't need to travel a fair bit. I prefer 15,6"" screens - large enough to use normally, small enough to travel with comfortably.

I've come up with the following customized laptop:

CLEVO P150EM:

Processor: Intel Core i7-3630QM 2.4 - 3.4GHz Turbo, 6MB L3 Cache, HD 4000, 22nm, 45W

RAM: 8 GB (2 x 4) KINGSTON HyperX 1600 MHz DDR3 CL9   

Main hard drive: 120 GB SSD KINGSTON HyperX 3K (555 / 510 MB/s)   

MSATA SSD Drive: none

Graphics card: AMD Radeon HD 7970M 2.0GB GDDR5 **OR** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675MX. Need help with this one. More below.

CD Drive: a HDD slot instead, to allow for future upgrades

The entirety of this would cost me 1779$ - which is already a bit above my alloted budget, but a lot of this seemed like too great value for money.

&amp;nbsp;

Next, I have a whole bunch of questions. 

* Do you know of any better deals than that? From a short look, I cannot find anything with similar performance in the same price range. Stock laptops at that range seem absolutely godawful for the most part.

* **Graphics Card**: How indicative are benchmarks of actual usability? On futuremark, the [Radeon](http://community.futuremark.com/hardware/gpu/AMD+Radeon+HD+7970M/review) is shown as much better in all respects compared to the [Geforce](http://community.futuremark.com/hardware/gpu/NVIDIA+GeForce+GTX+675MX/games). Yet, on the notebookcheck site, in the [computer games FPS table](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-Games-on-Laptop-Graphic-Cards.13849.0.html), the Geforce seems to perform notably better than the Radeon. When looking at benchmarks on [Notebookcheck](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Graphics-Cards-Benchmark-List.844.0.html), I notice that the Geforce does better than the Radeon in old benchmarks, but gets outclassed in the newer ones. How to interpret this? Does this mean that the Radeon is likely to have better performance in new, upcoming games?

* Do you think that's enough RAM? I have the option to get 16 or 32 gb, but I see no reason to whatsoever. There just don't seem to be any games that make use of that much memory (stuff like Crysis notwithstanding, though even there I doubt it). 

* This is my first time getting an SSD as a main hard drive (or at all). I happen to have purchased an external 2 TB hard drive recently, so I'm thinking of using that for any long term storage and large files, and the SSD for windows and demanding games. Do you think that'll be enough? Any experiences with this sort of thing? Anything particular I should know about SSDs?

* The MSATA SSD slot seems to have more expensive and far inferior drives to the main hard drive versions, so I'm getting none there - but there are good options. Should I use that slot instead of the main HDD for my SSD? Is there a difference, or are the two effectively the same?


* What about temperature? Basically - is the laptop likely to run at decent temperatures regardless of which parts from the customization options I choose, or will some be more problematic than others? I'm a bit worried that, if I choose something too powerful, I'll have overheating trouble.


* While I'm at it, I would love some tips or resources for taking care of a laptop. The Acer 5741g has gained many significant problems after over two years of very heavy usage, and I would like to keep any new laptop I purchase in best repair possible. (Specifically, the problems I have with the current laptop: Power Adapter jack is nearly broken and has constant connectivity issues, the battery has lost half of its max charge and only charges up to 50% now, the usb ports also have connectivity problems, and there's some deeper hardware problems going on as well).

Also with $1700 for the base model + $300 I am willing to spend for upgrade, I feel that just getting base 15"" retina for $2000 is better since it already comes with 256gb flash drive and 8gb ram instead of 4gb. 

Few of the upgrades I've been looking forward to do are: hdd to ssd(128g), ram up to 16gb. I'm sure there are upgrade out there to make it even better but I only have these two in mind. 

I would like to hear your opinions. Should i get base 15"" non retina and spend $300 on upgrade or just get $2000 retina base 15"". 

Lower pricing is possible because of student educational discount.

Edit: I am going with MBP because med school students recommend MBP if the school is okay with it.

RAM - I've heard and understand too much ram is unnecessary, but was it enough?  I'm that kind of guy that likes to have 20 tabs open at the same time, loll, but I'm no gamer.  I won't be using this for games, mainly for browsing and media like Netflix, also some photoshop and after effects.  So, how much ram would be enough?  4? 6? Would 8 be an unnecessary price to pay? 

Hard Drive - I know about SSD and how it's fast, but how much faster?  Would a computer that has a good amount of SSD and 4gb ram be better than something with regular hard drive and 8 gb ram?  These are my main questions, what really makes the difference in speed and performance. 

Processor - i3, i5, i7, etc.  Is it worth upgrading for quadcore/i7, or is that simply a luxury that isn't necessary?  My friend built his own desktop w. an i5 and it runs very fast, so that should be enough for a non-gamer especially like me, yes?  Also, GHz, how overrated is it?  Is a quadcore i7 at 1.9ghz w. SSD going to be faster than 3.0 ghz dualcore i5 w. regular hard drive? 

Screen Resolution - Does this matter at ALL if I'm not a gamer?  Will 1366x768 or whatever that standard resolution is be fine for a non-gamer?

Graphics card - Again, should this matter if I'm not a gamer?  I won't be using after effects or photoshop heavily, so would is a state of the art graphics card necessary?


Thanks for answering, I just want to make the best choice.  The difference between a slim ultrabook w. 4gb ram, SSD, 1.9 ghz and a chunkier laptop w. 8gb ram, 1 TB hdd, 3.0 ghz is something I don't have the knowledge to pick between, so any help is fantastic!

What I need from a laptop is power(CPU/GPU), and superior build quality.  When it come to power, I'm not too particular, I would be satisfied with ~3 Ghz  cpu, and mediocre GPU. But what matters most is build quality. I am writing this from my current laptop, which I have only had for 1 year, and need to give up because of recurring hardware issues. Portability would be nice (i.e. laptop over under 4 lbs), but anything less than 7 lbs is still okay.

Price range: under $600 but preferably over $500

Purpose: Schoolwork, entertainment, and light gaming. Things like skyrim, wow, civ5, etc. A decent graphics card is a plus.

OS: Windows 64-bit

I don't want to sacrifice quality for price. So basically the best all around bang for the buck given what I would use it for.

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: &lt;$1500 preferable, can stretch if need be

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Ultraportable for...well...portable use. I have a nice desktop at home that I'll be using most of the time. This laptop is for in-class derping, web browsing on the couch, and conducting some useful work outside of home. My computing habits are probably ~60% web browsing with a shit ton of tabs and windows, ~30% useful tasks like editing a word document, powerpoint and remote connection etc. and ~10% watching movies and random stuff, this may take place in bright environments at times.

* Screen size preference: 13-15"" Less than 13"" I find too small, not sure how much larger the 15"" laptops will be but I think I may prefer to have the extra real estate of 15"", not sure.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): No real preference, a windows user to this point but IDGAF. I would probably use a virtual machine for access to Windows though if I went MBA.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): None really

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Will be watching HD videos, especially in bright environments. General Microsoft Office work and probably some light CAD viewing work. Heavy CAD modeling and FEA simulation I would remote into my desktop to do so the laptop must be able to do that well as well.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): self support I guess?

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): None really

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I am a fan of the sleek, quality ultrabooks, especially unibody. MBA, Asus UX31 etc. Also a big fan of touchpad gesturing like 2 finger scrolling etc. Basically anything that will make it easier for me to navigate without a mouse.

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Biased towards low noise/heat, so long as it does everything I ask for.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: Yes

* A great keyboard: To a point, I won't be doing a heinous amount of typing but some here and there, so long as its suitable. However, I CANT STAND the way my palm causes my current laptop to jump the cursor around. Must be avoided.

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes, this is very important to me given how much I browse etc.

* Great audio: Meh, will be not home and likely using headphones anyway

**List any features that are critical:**
Need USB 3.0, must have SSD (whether I put it in after the fact or buy one with it), a trick SD slot is nice for extra storage, full size HDMI port would be nice but doesn't seem to be that common. Must have at least 5hrs of general use battery life, its likely I'll just wake up and grab it without consciously charging it always.

I should also mention I'm not in a huge rush to get it right now if there are going to be new models coming out soon with the Christmas season and all. Plus I assume theres going to be a whole bunch of cool new stuff coming out for Windows 8, so should I just wait till then? Right now really considering anything at the 13"" range, specifically the UX32VD since it can be upgraded to a pretty badass form. There really don't seem to be many 15"" ultrabook options, just the Samsung Series 9 15"" which I think I'd like, need to check it out.

Also completely open to upgrading the laptop. Asus UX32VD seems to be a great option in this regard, totally willing to toss in some more RAM and a SSD. In fact the idea of being able to upgrade the laptop so I can hang onto it for some time is appealing. Realistically I don't need a super powerful laptop, just something that can handle basic tasks, lots of web browsing/tabs and be quick about it.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1348011163.0,,,True,t3_103lgq,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/103lgq/us_1500_1315_ultrabook_now_or_wait/,

It took THREE DAYS and multiple hours of talking to customer service reps (none of whom spoke proper english) to get an RMA and invoice to have my (brand new) laptop shipped to their service center.  I spent literal hours being led in circles.  But wait, it gets better.


While on the phone one of these times, it was suggested I buy accidental damage coverage.  I was told 3 years of coverage for $50.  Sounds like a deal, so I reluctantly agreed, and paid by card.  I get an email pretty quick telling me what I got - except it wasn't 3 years of coverage, it was 1.  So I was lied to.  At this point I'm mad - very - so I call support again.  Tell them to cancel the warranty service like it says I can in the brochure PDF, for a full refund.  THEY CAN'T FIND THE CHARGE.  It doesn't exist on their systems.  So another hour or two and a consult with a supervisor later, and the rep says they've got it covered, and just give them 24-48 hours to reflect the refund on my account.  It's been nearly 72 hours now, and I'm still out $50.  Their service is so bad I'm not even willing to get back on the phone and complain to get it fixed.  I'll be contacting my bank about a fraudulent charge this afternoon.


I will NEVER buy their product again.  The only reason I am not returning my laptop is that by the time it gets back, I won't be able to.  Avoid them at all costs.

* Country of purchase:
USA

* Budget range:
Up to $750

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.):
Mainstream/desktop replacement.

* Screen size preference:
13""-15"".

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):
Any.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):
I don't game. Only very light gaming every now and then.

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):
I do need something that can handle the Adobe Suite (mostly Photoshop). Occasional video editing.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):
Self.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility):
Don't really have any preferences.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):
Nothing in particular. I don't care for looks.

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight:
Battery life.

* Build quality -vs- Low price:
Balanced.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:
I'd take some noise/heat for better performance.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen:
I'm coming from a 7 year old Dell desktop with a 15"" monitor  at 1024x768. I know most people would recommend something with a high resolution, but anything's a step up at this point.

* A great keyboard:
Would be nice, but not necessary.

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons:
Again, nice, but not necessary.

* Great audio:
I use headphones.

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)
Optical drive. USB ports. SD slot would be nice but not necessary. Need a webcam on it too.

I'm looking for something to last me throughout college (I'm a senior in high school) that can run  Microsoft Office and the Adobe Suite. I do a lot of Photoshop work (not huge files though), so I need something with some power. Like I said above, I'm coming from a 7 year old  (weak) Dell desktop, so anything's an upgrade at this point. I've actually been looking at Dell Vostro laptops since I hear their business laptops are built better. And the price/spec ratio is pretty good too.

Any recommendations are welcome!",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_wumnm,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/wumnm/700_budget_for_an_adobe_suite_and_school_laptop/,

(rant),10,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/v83v7/new_sony_viao_se_laptops_avoid_rant/,"Background: I have the SE 15"" model with the IPS display and I like it very much, but felt that the dual-core i5 and max 8 gigs of ram were limiting. So when the new SE ""ivy bridge"" models with real quad cores and nVidia graphics became avail, I ordered it.

So this came in today, FedEx'd from China. Open the box up, and right away there are problems. First off, the material on the laptop is some rough non-skid stuff like you find in tubs or outdoor steps. Doesn't show fingerprints, but picks *every single mote of dust and lint* in your office. Okay, unique I guess, I think that I can deal with that - but then it turns out the cdrom is a very noisy slot loader that resets every time you boot or come out of sleep mode and is annoying as hell. But the real deal killer was the trackpad: Sony has decided to go with a variant of the Macintosh buttonless trackpad, but the way they implemented the right mouse button is to put it a the bottom-right of the pad - so every time you go for it, you move the cursor AWAY from what you're trying to hit. After an hour of frustration in trying to actually use the thing for development, I completely gave up and RMA'd the thing back. Which is too bad, because the features I was focusing on - i7, slot loading, two USB3 ports, nVidia graphics - were completely ruined by the rest of the system (and they still use the stupid speed/stamina switch that you don't need with nVidia, and took away the hardware switch for the wireless). And to mention they went with UEFI for the boot made imaging the harddrive a pain in the ass.

This is really fucking sad because I was recommending the previous model (which I currently have) a decent choice for some users. It still is, if you can find it on sale for $600-$800, but anyone expecting the same or better in the current Sony Viao S/SE offerings will be sadly disappointed and should look elsewhere.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_v83v7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/v83v7/new_sony_viao_se_laptops_avoid_rant/,

I remember doing a search about Eurocom on reddit and I didn't find anything so hopefully the next person that does the same thing will find my review.

First, the company. You go on their website, you configure the laptop and when you buy it, you get an automated email confirming your purchase. In the next days, it's not automated like NCIX but someone from their company will contact you. I contacted them myself by email on a Monday and they told me that the laptop would be made Tuesday and would ship on Wednesday. And it did, and I got my laptop very fast after that.
Overall their website is very nice and the price was the best for me. However I saved a lot of money by buying my ram and SSD separately, their upgrades on the configurator are really too expansive.  

  
The laptop :

I paid $849+tax CAD for the basic Fox 4.0 with an Ivy Bridge processor i7-3610qm. Shipping was free.
I think this laptop is basically the Clevo P150em so I will just say that it's a great laptop. You install Windows, you install your drivers and you get to work immediately. Everything you do is extremely fast, the computer is silent and the screen is good.
Here are the things I don't like about it :  
- The power supply has a block connected in 2 places. One is connected to your pc and the other to the power bar. You plug the powerbar cable into the power supply and this thing is very loose. If you just hold it by the cable it will detach itself. I've memorized this so hopefully there won't be any accidents, I don't want to drop this on my laptop!  
- At night, I really miss having a back-lit keyboard. I have a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate on my desktop and I miss the feeling.  
- When you close the laptop for transportation, the screen is not anchored to your laptop. So when you push your screen to open your laptop, the whole laptop will lift and it's very annoying. I use my other hand to hold the laptop down while I open it. My old HP laptop was anchored so it didn't have this problem.  

My upgrades :
Mushkin Chronos 120g - $99  (I opened the case, plugged it in the open 2.5"" space and closed the case)
1x8gig Corsair 1600mhz - $55 (You have to put the ram at 30 degrees to install it, took me a while to figure this out. Easy install if you know that).

I heard different reports about mixing different ram brands together. Some said that it would cause problems, some said that it wouldn't. Well I tried it and CPU-z reports that my 12 gig of ram works in dual channel with no problem. The ram modules have different timings but they are the same voltage.

Overall I'm very happy. I use the laptop for programming and gaming (DotA 2, Diablo 3 and CIV 5).",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_umczy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/umczy/eurocom_fox_40_my_short_review/,

There are some announcements to make!

1) I'm looking at incorporating user flair for all users, in a manner similar to the way [/r/techsupport](/r/techsupport) does theirs. Proven reliable and frequent contributors here will be given flair to distinguish them. I'm also considering putting in templates for user flair that people can pick for themselves. (Something along the lines of maybe ""x owner"" where x is a list of popular brands). 

Do we want proven contributors to have an icon, text, or both next to their names? What should the icon/text be? 

2) The moderators are looking at revamping the submission system. Instead of copy/pasting a form from NBR, we're hoping to roll out something more elegant. Stay tuned as we get this hammered out.

3) There has been interest in some minor changes to the quick picks. We've updated the models that were pointed out specifically as well as adding a date to show when the list was last changed. If anyone has any other models to add/remove or other general suggestions, please pass them on. We do our best to keep up, but with so much out there we are always looking for input. We've considered a voting system, but honestly there are always a pretty typical rotation of suggestions in here to the same few models. So in that case, listing them all isn't a problem.

4) Does anyone have any feelings about subreddit styles? This can be headers, background images, and themes.

For that, I understand that I need a fast and responsive computer that does not become sluggish with the Eclipse IDE, and by the emulators that are gonna be run as part of the development.

For that i have some basic questions about processors, and about the speed of the hard drive. 

1. Presently I have looked into the Intel line, and understand that I may go for i3 or i5 second generation processors. However, I am not clear about the corresponding AMD processors. What are the comparable AMD processors which give the same or better speed for somewhat heavy duty multi threaded apps ( which I assume much of Android development is gonna be)?

2. How much difference does a 7200 rpm SATA make as compared to a 5400 rpm?  Will there be a noticeable difference? Further, will I note the difference only with the faster processors, or the advantage that will come from a faster rpm will come with the relatively slower i3 processor too? 

3. I wish i could buy one of those high end models with SSD's because I have heard that they are pretty speedy. However, can I take ANY laptop and add a smaller 64GB SSD to it? Is this a good idea?  

4. Last, there are a LOT of manufacturers with almost the same specs in the market. And by same I mean, they have the same processor, DDR3 ram, 500 GB hard drive. Taking such similar laptops, should I base my buying decision on the motherborards that these laptops come with?

So first off, I'm going to apologize for my lack of knowledge when it comes to the specs of laptops and computers in general. That being said, let's get started (sorry for the wall of text...).

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: United States.
 
* Budget range: Just don't go over $2000. And yes, I'm thinking about getting a Mac along with whatever else you guys suggest.
 
* Purpose: School computer, Video editing (Adobe Premiere at least, maybe Final Cut Pro if a Mac), Microsoft office, Internet browsing, and for gaming.
 
* Screen size preference:  Nothing smaller than a 13-inch. Preferably a 15-inch or larger.
 
* OS preference: Mac or Windows.
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): If it can run [Arma II](http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_2:_System_Requirements) (Arma III soon?) smoothly without issue, then I'll be happy. That, and any MMO. I guess we can use [World of Warcraft](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/minimum-system-requirements-for-world-of-warcraft) as an example, though I've never played it. More examples - Minecraft, Battlefield, GTA. 
 
* Performance requirements: 3.0GHz, 256GB drive, and 8GB of Ram or anything better than these specs.
 
* Method of computer support: Self support, or rather family support. I've got a few computer geeks (sorry) in the family.
 
* Brand preferences and reasons: None. My family is an Apple family, but I've owned a toshiba laptop before. Plus, I'm very familiar with both Windows and Mac computers.
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Anything thin and sleek. I'd use the [Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) as an example, and maybe something along the lines of a [Razor](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro).
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Battery.
 
* Build quality -vs- Low price: Price isn't to big an issue (necessarily), so build quality.
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance, though it's kinda close.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
 
* High resolution screen: Meh. Not really. If it's really a drastic improvement, then maybe.
 
* A great keyboard: Yes.
 
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes.
 
* Great audio: Yes, although I'd most likely end up using higher quality headphones anyway.

**List any features that are critical:** USB 3.0. HDMI port. Plus a few extra things down below.

I didn't know where to throw this in, but one more reason I want a laptop/desktop is to be able to record video from a gaming system (xbox, Playstation, etc.), and the capture card I'd use is the [Blackmagic Intensity series](http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/). Now, I'd need USB 3.0 for this (which shouldn't be an issue), but I wasn't really sure if it'd run using a laptop (which is one of my main issue).

And I feel I should clarify - I'm leaning towards a Mac laptop along with a Windows desktop because I want both Final Cut and Premiere, and to be able to have both OS' for different software, while not having to struggle between professional computer and gaming/internet surfing computer. That could be fixed with bootcamp on the Mac, which I'd be more than open to doing, but I'm not sure if the capture card would work well (if at all) on a laptop. If not, then I might have to just suck it up.

In writing this, I think I'm liking the idea of an Apple laptop with a Windows desktop. I'd like to hear your opinion! Any help would be awesome and greatly appreciated! Thanks again in advance.

I think it would be useful to compile some pros and cons, and perhaps come to some conclusions about who should and who should not get a touch screen.

So far:

Pros:

* Increased utility.
* Makes Windows 8 easier (how much? comments on this would be great).
* Potentially a good compromise for someone that also wants a tablet.

Cons:

* Higher price
* Typically increases laptop thickness.
* Fingerprints
* No matte option


Considerations:

* Regular laptop with touch screen, versus ""convertible"" (Lenovo Yoga), versus dock/attachment (Surface).

Any points to add? Extrapolate? Is it pointless with a ""regular"" laptop? Does it make Windows 8 much better? Thanks!

The benefit of the Air is that it is lighter, longer battery life and it has a higher native resolution.  

The Pro, is heavier, shorter battery life and lower native resolution. However, it has a much faster CPU, more storage capacity, and a dvd-writer.  

Trying to weigh the benefits of increased portability vs. more power. Truth be told, am upgrading from a 6yr old Windows XP Acer notebook, so right now, anything will be an improvement, abacus included!

 I've been thinking about my options for my impending computer purchase.  I am concerned about multiple factors in my purchase.

* Impact of buying a brand new computer (was thinking refurbished for this reason)
* Labor practices of the given computer company (*very* difficult to weigh)
* Free-Software OS (Free as in Freedom)
* Privacy (obviously) [localized data, easy to modify for VPN, PGP, Tor, etc.] 
* Least bloatware to deal with (upon purchase) [Probably stock with the machine]
* Durability (accesibility for repairs and known to perform in stress tests)

I know to steer clear of Dell, Apple, and Google's Chrome OS/Android, but I am wondering what people here might think of Lenovo, particularly their acquisition of IBM's ThinkPad line.  If I am going to buy a computer I need it to be ready for dual-booting if possible.
With all of that in mind, I suppose there are a few questions:

* Is Linux 12.04, with their Wubi software for Windows, worthwhile?  What about the Amazon search in Unity and the push towards cloud computing with Ubuntu One?

* How easy is it to dual-boot Trisquel or other GNU/Linux/Debian based distros with a proprietary OS while maintaining privacy?  What is the best for privacy?

* Is live-booting and Tails *really* all-around better than an installed non-amnesic OS?

* Do any of you find that there is a sacrifice of compatibility/functionality because the operating system is not necessarily tailored to the hardware?  

* Is it better to use one proprietary system and another incognito/privacy oriented system for practical reasons?

**The above questions may not be as relevant here as they were in /r/Privacy, but I still think they may help the reader understand the setup I am aiming for**

* Screen size preference: **15.6 or 17.3 inch. I'm curious about the bigger screen - what do you guys think of 17 inch laptops?**

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): **Windows - preferably Windows 7, but I'm fine with 8. Hardware is more important**

General purpose laptop, so I do need a CD/DVD drive (no blu-ray), 3 or 4 usb ports, ethernet, SD card slot, and battery. 

**Things I'm willing to sacrifice/don't need at all:**
bluetooth, blu-ray, great speakers, i7 processor (an i5 is fine), firewire, other extraneous features like fingerprint readers... you get the idea.

I'm also curious about getting an SSD or a hybrid HDD/SSD but I know those are usually a bit above my budget. I am not very knowledgeable about gpu's, their benchmarking tests, or computer architecture so I just want to know that I'm not being duped by good looking specs at a low price.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Saints Row the Third, Skyrim, Minecraft, Valve games, Indies, likely AAA games over the next few months. I'd like to achieve at least PS3-level graphics and then some.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self support

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business

Doesn't need to shit fireworks but I'd like something that doesn't make me want to puke when I take it out. I'd also like a brand that has a good support rep and quality record. I've had family members have their HP laptops conk out in only months after purchase (brand new) due to motherboard issues. Several times. I'm using a Toshiba laptop right now and I'm pretty satisfied with it, so I'd be willing to jump to them. I like Sony's designs and build quality seems good.

Maybe I'll do EVE or replay some Dragon Age / Mass Effect series later this year. Would like those as close to maxed as well. PS4 preordered for later this year will have to hold me over for FPS's til I can get back to the desktop.

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): As you can see, gaming is a high priority to keep myself occupied, but as I plan on completing school via Embry Riddle online, a solid/large keyboard that my gorilla paws can use would save me alot of heartburn. I did a year with only a $300 Acer netbook. Never. Again.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): self support. 

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): For laptops, I don't have much brand loyalty. 

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Style. This is more of a what I DON'T want than what I DO want. I don't think I could pull off taking a GT70 DRAGONZZZ EDITION out into the wild without dying of embarrassment.

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: No preference. This is going to be plugged into a wall as soon as I get to where I'm going. 

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build Quality. This thing is going to be in fairly austere conditions, so it needs to not be flimsy. Being able to type without feeling like I'm slapping a wet noodle for a keyboard would be a massive plus.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: This. Wish I could have 120hz. But not a dealbreaker

* A great keyboard: This.

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Not this. Will be using a plug in mouse

* Great audio: Not this. Will be using headphones mostly.

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) SSD drives are, at least to my mind, something I think makes one of the most noticeable differences in performance. Looking for around 256GB. Will probably supplement with external 1TB. So USB 3.0 would be nice too. Would also consider an HDMI port to transfer to a tablet so I'm not in my bed/couch watching movies with a slab of high technology incinerating me. That does it for hard specs. The effect I'm most concerned with is a buttery smooth (at least on the client side, we'll see about the internet when I get to where I'm going) MMO experience with enjoyable movie watch and cock-solid school going capability.

I have an address I can send it to, but it would be overseas and pass through enough hands that shouldn't be realistically expected not to be ""lose"" in transit.

I'm looking at getting a Sager NP7352 / Clevo W350STQ and I just had a couple of questions.

1. Is the premium parts warranty worthwhile? They say you get ""very special prices on all upgrades and components for your system"" in addition to lifetime limited labor... Does anyone have experience with how special these special prices are? Given that I will likely buy a new laptop rather than upgrading this one, is it worthwhile to get a premium parts warranty in case something breaks? (1 year is free, 3 years is $150).

2. I want to have my OS on an SSD and media storage on an HDD. It looks to me like it's cheaper to buy an SSD from Newegg and install it myself. Are there any drawbacks or tricks I should be aware of?

3. I don't do anything terribly color-sensitive, but I do occasionally find my Thinkpad's display a bit dim in the sunlight. Is the 95% NTSC color gamut screen worth $50 for the average buyer?

I just had two quick questions.

First, there are no models within my price range currently that come with the SSD (except for one that has the 650m graphics card.) I would like the option to add one at a later date though (might put my linux install on it even, since that's where I'll probably be spending most of my time/ developing.) I've been chatting with their customer service trying to figure out how that SSD is connected, and he told me that it is not in the ultrabay (which is good,) and that it was attached via PCI, which seemed odd to me. Then he told me it was an mSATA drive, which makes more sense. 

So, just to confirm it, does anyone else know if it's possible to add an internal SSD after I buy it, without either replacing the 1tb drive it comes with or getting some ultrabay version/adapter? In other words, is there a free mSATA port in the models that don't come with an extra SSD, that I could just put my own drive into?

Secondly, I've seen a lot of people mention a Barnes and Noble discount. How does that work? I've done some googling but it seems like the deals I've found related to Barnes and Noble don't apply to the y500s, so I thought perhaps I was doing it wrong. I wouldn't mind getting a bit of a deal if possible. I spoke to a customer service rep about the student discount, and it wound up being a little less than I was hoping for (~$20), so if they don't stack or anything I'm okay with it.

My idea so far is.  Something on the smaller size 14inch screen would be good.  This way its easy and light to take around.  For at home use it will be docked with a mechanical keyboard (he still wrights on a type writer, and would love the feel), monitor, speakers, ect.  He hates being stuck at home so having a easy dock and small computer it will be good set up.


He will be using office programs, skype,  maybe spotify or other things I set up for him.  


I will post links too two I had in mind so far.  Both refurbished and I don't mind saving a few bucks that way.  What do you think about that?  Also taking in any suggestions on other rigs. 

All help is much appreciated!

I'm interested in something that is in the small form factor/high battery life style. Something preferably with an SSD.
I look at the Samsung Chromebook and like it for its portability, lightweight, price, and battery life. In all likelihood I would probably tinker with it and throw CrUbuntu on there. 

Then I started thinking if I can do better? Does anyone know if I can find somethin in the 12'-11.6 range with similar body and specs as the Samsung Chromebook? I realize the CPU an ARM in that, and how it might differ in other 
suggested models. 

The Lenovo X130e is currently going on Ebay for ~$500, which is double the Chromebook. 

The Samsung Series 9 13.3 is priced way out of the realm. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

* Country of purchase: USA.
 
* Budget range: Ideally, $800.
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): General use and productivity. I am going to major in computer science, so I will be doing a lot of programming.
 
* Screen size preference: 13"" to 15"".
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows.
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): I have a desktop, so I will not be doing heavy gaming on this. However, I would like to run some miscellaneous indie titles, though I imagine most laptops will do fine with those. The most demanding titles I would play are things like StarCraft II, TF2, and (if it ever comes out in America) PSO2. I am fine with low/medium settings, but I would like to be able to play at native resolution.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Like I said earlier, I will be majoring in computer science and doing lots of programming. A solid processor would be great (like an i5) as well as eight gigs of RAM.
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Between college tech support and my own knowledge, I should be fine.
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): I have heard that Asus and Lenovo build very reliable laptops with great keyboards. I am open to other brands, though.
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I really want something that's portable, so I have been looking at thin/light laptops and ultrabooks. I have no interest in convertibles and touchscreens, and do not want to pay extra for one.

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality. I am willing to spend more money to ensure it lasts at least five years.
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Low noise/heat. I have a desktop for my high-performance needs.
 
**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
 
* High resolution screen: No.
 
* A great keyboard: YES; I need a great keyboard. I would love something backlit, but it's not required.
 
* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes.

I've been looking around for certain brands, and I'm leaning towards the low-end MSIs because their specs, designs, and software all look top-notch. I wouldn't be against a Lenovo, or HP...Alienware would be great, but probably out of my price range (new starts at $1500)

My priorities are:
Battery life &gt; weight
low price &gt; build quality
high performance &gt; low heat (barely)

I'd also like:
HDMI port
matte screen
17"" screen (if possible, 15"" minimum)
1080p screen

I wouldn't be against buying either refurbished or slightly used, off eBay...just so long as it's a (somewhat) reputable source.

Let me know if there's something perfect out there, as of right now I'm looking at the [MSI 0ND GE70-212US](http://ca.msi.com/product/nb/GE70-0ND-212US.html). I found one for $1100, shipping included.

I would need an Ethernet port, an SD card slot and an optical drive but I wouldn't care if I had use an external one for the two that that applies to.  

Here is the important information:  I need a new computer.  My current one just doesn't cut it and I have decided my next will be a laptop for the portability.  I have been watching the subreddit for a while and it seems that the Lenovo Y500 is the favorite gaming laptop for my budget however I would like to build computer.  I understand that it's uncommon to build a laptop and have had a hard time finding good information about it.  If anyone wants to link a site that has information and/or sells the barebones cases I would appreciate it.  

But, assuming I am going to buy a prebuilt machine, I still have a few questions.  

1.  How useful is a SSD actually?  I understand that it is faster but is that only when people are playing hardcore and every bit of speed matters?  Or will a casual gamer see the difference?  Also, if you have both an SSD and a HDD, how will they work together?

2.  Are cooling pads really effective on laptops and could someone recommend a good one?

3.  Could someone recommend a nice, external SD card reader and a optical drive?

4. i5 vs i7:  How big is the difference and would it be worth it to wait for the new Intel CPUs to come out?

I'd just like to share a couple of thoughts about my recent Lenovo purchase. I did a lot of research and asked a couple of times in this subreddit too, so maybe this will be helpful to someone else if they use the search function.

I bought mine from here: http://www.komplett.se/k/ki.aspx?sku=773486

The most interesting/infuriating part of the experience is that I could not find out what SSD I was getting until I got my laptop. There's nothing on the Merchant's site except for size, I searched Lenovo's site, I googled, I asked here and on some other forums - NOTHING! I was expecting a pretty crappy SSD but I bought it anyway because the HDD model was only like $30 cheaper for a 500GB HDD, and storage space is not an issue for me, I'd rather have something small, quiet and fast.

In any case I was very pleasantly surprised to learn that I had a Samsung 830 SSD in my machine! It's not quite the 840, but pretty close, it's definitely a good deal. Here's Anand's review if anyone is interested: http://www.anandtech.com/show/4863/the-samsung-ssd-830-review

So can anyone tell me why this insanity exists? I would have understood if it was a crappy SSD, but why won't you advertize the fact that you have a great Samsung drive in your machine? Or at least make the information available to prospective buyers?

Some other random thoughts about the laptop after a day of use. 

It came with both Win7 installed and a Win8 DVD, but I don't think I want the upgrade. It also comes with a ton of software installed, some of the usual trial crap but not too much, and a bunch of Lenovo apps that I don't think I need but maybe some people do. Not nearly as bad as the Acer I bought before. At the first boot I was greeted with a very threatening message from Symantec's antivirus program, something along the lines of ""nice machine you have there buddy, would be a real shame if something happened to it!"".

The machine itself is fast and quiet, the most quiet laptop I have ever seen. If there's a CPU fan I can't hear it. It's a real pleasure to work on it, performance is on par with my desktop (first gen i5CPU, second gen Intel SSD), maybe even a little faster at some tasks.

It also looks great from a distance, the screen is bright and contrasty and the matte finish looks good. Up close it feels a bit cheap and plasticky and I'm not a big fan of the touchpad. I have an HP at work that has a really nice touchpad, I got use to just tapping it for clicking. On the Lenovo you need to actually press it down pretty hard. Also the click and right-click are part of the touchpad and not separate buttons and pressing them can be finicky.

I bought this machine for my wife, the most CPU-intensive app she'll use is probably Inkscape. I tried it a little and it seems to work perfectly. This is definitely not a gaming machine, didn't even try anything on it, but the Intel HD4000 should be able to run some games on very basic settings.

Anyway, if you're looking for a good non-gaming laptop for a decent price that does not cut too many corners, I can recommend this one.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,t3_1bse4z,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1bse4z/thoughts_on_the_lenovo_thinkpad_e530_wsamsung_830/,

I only know desktops so I could use some clarification on a few of the laptop specific areas.

**Tl;Dr : Need new laptop, I only know desktops, please answer some questions**

**My Questions:**

1. Does an SSD come with the OS loaded on it? If so would a 32gb SSD have 32gb and the SSD worth of storage or does the preloaded OS make the SSD only have ~12gb (idk if the OS is actually 20gb) of storage.

2. How do laptops' graphics (cards) work. All &lt;$1000 laptops I have seen do not have graphics cards in which I am familiar with. For non-gaming purposes what is a good graphics processor (I do not know what to call them) for a ~$600 budget?

3. Which brands are considered bad or untrustworthy and why? If customer service or part quality is a problem for a company in such a way that it makes the product not worth buying please let me know.

4. How reliant are laptops on the processor? When looking around at the graphic processors i saw that a certain on (I cannot remember which) said that its performance relied on the processor. Is this true for all if any graphics processors?

Thank you in advanced for any help I receive and I will update the post if someone answers a question of mine to help others in the future if they decide to look at this post.

I'm looking to purchase basically the cheapest possible laptop for use in class and when I'm out of the house/office. I'll be doing mainly Java and Android development, and will need to do a small amount of image editing as well. 

I don't need a lot of storage space as I have a desktop at home and make good use of Google Drive to transfer files between my work PC, home PC, and smartphone. I don't need a lot of processing power, as just about any modern processor should be able to handle what I'm doing. My only performance requirement is an SSD, which I'll install myself. To that end the computer must have a user replaceable hard drive and a disk from which I can install the OS. Failing that, I guess I could clone the drive over, but I've never done that and don't know if it's recommended for a system drive.

I'm tempted to buy the cheapest Asus or Acer I can find at Micro Center, but the variety of mobile processors and GPUs is a bit overwhelming and I don't want to make the wrong purchase.

I appreciate any advice you guys and gals can give me. Thank you!

On paper, nothing else I can find comes close, with the possible exception of the £549 Inspiron 15R, which trades weight (2.32kg) and the SSD for a bigger hard drive and a better graphics card, and seemingly a better battery too (65mwh compared to 44mwh). The weight is a fairly important difference though (though I just weighed my current laptop, and it turned out to be 2.4kg, slightly more than I thought, so perhaps the 15R's higher weight is not so bad...).

As I said, ON PAPER, nothing else seems to come close to those sorts of specs for that price, particularly for that weight - and as someone with a bad back, weight is certainly an issue. However, the reviews of the 14Z I've read are decidedly mixed, and Dell seems fairly unpopular here. So are there any better models from other manufacturers that I might be interested in? Or which of the models above would you choose? And perhaps most importantly, are there any expected imminent product refreshes etc I might want to keep an eye on, or that I would regret not waiting for?

A bonus slightly philosophical question: my current laptop, Acer Extensa 5635Z (2gb ram, T4300 processor, Vista, got free from Uni at the start of 2010) feels like it's coming to the end of its life in that it quite frequently hangs particularly when switching tabs and tasks. Hence the shopping for a new one. That said, in many ways it's still in good working order, and I'm somehow reluctant to replace something that isn't strictly broken - especially as tech keeps improving. So the questions: how much should I put up with before it's reasonable to upgrade? Also, any ideas of what to do with my old laptop when I replace it?

I just want a simple laptop thats quick/responsive, can play some light games (LoL type graphics), and has a 1920x1080 screen if possible in my price range. I do not care about many fancy bells and whistle, although I also like slim / sleek and a long battery life.

Right now the ACER has an exceptional battery life and seems pretty quick, but I want to see if there are any other options that offer similar features with a 1920x1080 screen. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Nope. All stock is depleted. They have no ideas about anything. No idea when they'll have anything to ship, no idea when I can expect an update, no answers at all. Except to reiterate that hey, didn't I get an awesome price?

I will be starting business school in August, so I'm looking for a laptop suitable for business / productivity apps - MS Office, some light Photoshop, maybe SPSS. Looking for a portable laptop, ultrabook preferred, with a 13.3"" or 14"" screen size, decent screen, and 6-7 hour battery life (if ultrabook). I'll be using Excel a lot so I prefer a high screen resolution. Also would prefer light weight. I am open to buying something like a Lenovo T430 but only because I can buy a 9 cell battery. I purchased a really good Groupon deal for a ASUS UX31A ultrabook earlier this week but Groupon failed me hard so I won't be getting it. 

Question: is it worth it to wait until Haswell ultrabooks are released? Timing will be sensitive since I need my laptop by July and Haswell is supposed to debut around June.

So I am in grad school and I do computational work which I program and debug locally and then send it off to be crunched on the mainframe. Then pull down the output and do post-processing using python normally.

Right now I program on desktops but would like to go get lost in the stacks away from distraction, thus the need for a laptop that can run more than power point.
Originally I limited myself to gaming laptops because I would like to also play around with CUDA thus I was thinking about the [Lenovo Y500 59360241]( http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=457&amp;Code=59360241&amp;category_id=5B0116E237099FA0FCA012D9B20ED2FB)


But then I was thinking that portable would be more useful and having a touch screen for making up PDF’s would be even better so I started looking at Ultrabooks that have touch screens and that are of some size. I must admit that on this front I have looked considerably less, and really need much more advice. So here are some questions that would help me out if someone knew:

1.	Is there a touch screen ultrabook with a CUDA compatible GPU?

-	I found the following [from NVIDIA]( http://blogs.nvidia.com/2012/03/real-ultrabooks-have-gpus/), but no touch

-	[From Dell](http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-15z-5523/pd) but the touch doesn’t fold back so u can use it like a tablet.

2.	I also looked at the following ultrabooks:

-	[IdeaPad Yoga 13]( http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=1A4B81C8AC677A5FB11849005C1752B5)

-	[ASUS TAICHI™ 21](http://incredibletogether.asus.com/taichi21.html)

-	[Acer Aspire S7]( http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model-datasheet/NX.M3EAA.006)


Lastly I also like using two screens when working and would like to get a second protable usb screen such as the [GeChic On-Lap]( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0V10H35673) or the [AOC E1649FWU](http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362415356&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=GeChic). Any thoughts on these USB powered second screens would be welcome.

So I know I am a little all over the place but if you have opinions I would appreciate you sharing them.

I used to have an HP laptop, but it died last year and I never replaced it due to not really needing one. Now, though, I end up in the hospital for extended periods of time (cancer sucks) and being without a laptop is awful. I'm trying to work on getting into law schools, and completing applications with no computer access is very difficult. I'd also like to be able to watch Netflix in the hospital, access the internet, etc. For now, I just use my cell phone. 

I'm looking to buy something affordable as my medical bills really stretch me for cash. I'm looking at a few on Amazon right now that are under $400. I don't need to do anything that would be super difficult for a basic computer to handle. I've also looked at the Chromebooks but I don't know how I feel about them yet. 

If you have any suggestions, that would be great. If you have a laptop that you no longer use and would be willing to sell, even better.

I was hoping the series 7 chronos would come out, which it just did. I had a look at it today in Best Buy - it looks pretty damn good, the screen is on a whole different level to the others (seems finally on par with high end tablets).

Before I go ahead and purchase it perhaps someone can help me with a few things:

* Are there any decent alternatives to it - that is, similar specs (specifically decent graphics and screen), similar look/feel/quality and battery life (5+ hours).

* I've heard the 8770 is good but cant find any benchmarks. I presume it is similar to 650M?

* I've heard the series 7 Ultra is coming, this smaller size would be preferable but I haven't heard when it will be released. Anyone have a rough release date?

Thanks.

Found [this thread](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/702308-introducing-new-series-7-chronos-amd-hd8870m-139.html#post9093960) which one fella did a 3D mark benchmark.

She mainly uses it for browsing but sometimes does some basic photo manipulation and word processing for her work. She uses it on the couch or in the bed, so more of a netbook style than a full on laptop.  She often just lays the thing on the ground, drops it off the bed, or kicks/stumps her toe on it by accident so nothing made of sugar glass.

I'm on the fence between a relatively modern netbook(assuming a lot of the failures with the 1st gens have been rectified) and the possibility of a Chromebook.  I usually have to do a clean install on her netbook atleast once a year due to viruses, popups, etc so a similar but safer OS would not be a bad thing. I am unsure if Chrome OS can print, how a majority of Apps work without a touch screen, and what kind of future support the current ARM models with have.

A refurbished or used netbook would be familiar, more versatile, and still offer me the opportunity to trade tech support for a blow job, but I've never been a laptop guy, especially if I'm looking at older models included. A tablet/netbook hybrid would be great and I've looked at the Fujitsu LifeBook's but I get the feeling those things are fragile. She has little hands; no problems with the Lillipution layout of the Eee, but the trackpad definitely makes her cuss.

",7,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18f3mj/us_1000_budget_without_tax_looking_for_gaming/,"Before I say anything, I just want to assure everyone that I have checked out every laptop in the quick pick mid gaming and gaming. 

Personally quick pick has great choice of laptops and reasonable price. I was originally aiming to buy MBP 15"" but after what people commented on my previous post, I've changed my mind about not getting MBP. The price indeed did not justify the internal component. So here I am looking for a laptop ~ $1000. 

Country of purchase: United States
Budget range: $1000

Purpose: everyday: web browsing, word document, picture viewing, online video watching, music listening. 4+ days a week: gaming at high to ultra setting. I play WoW, SC2, Dota2 and CS go. 

Screen size preference: 15.6 or anything in 15 in range.

OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows 7 preferably but I have the windows 7 CD

Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): WoW, SC2, Dota2, CS gO at 50-60fps

Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): not sure what this is. 

Method of computer: homework, game, online search, downloading pics and music.

Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): been using Lenovo given out by school and dell xps 420 that I bought 4 yrs ago. Lenovo was crap starting first year but xps is still strong being able to run games I mentioned at high setting.

Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Anything that looks nice, really.  I am opened to all brand regardless but msi has great looks such as back light keyboard so anything like that is great. I would also like speakers on top rather than facing the floor. Touch pad with clickable actual button is preferred. 

Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
Long battery life -vs- Low weight: I always have charger with me so I'd prefer low weight more. I don't care if it's heavy unless it's more than 10lb
Build quality -vs- Low price: build quality as in durability of the frames? If so as long as thing hold well, breaking won't be much issue. I'm very careful with techs. I say low price is much preferred
Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: high performance all the way. I won't be playing games in class or outside my house so noise is no problem. As for the heat, as long as I don't get burns then I'm okay. If it gets too hot I can use my keyboard. 
Would you pay a premium for something that has:
High resolution screen: Depends.
A great keyboard: Yes. As in back lit with customizable like msi gx60 
A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes.
Great audio: Second most important after the keyboard. I love listening to music. If subwoofers on laptop is great then I'd like to have that. 

List any features that are critical: (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.): to be honest I do not know the difference btw USB 2.0 and 3.0. Higher the better? But I'd like to have as many built in USB port as possible ~4. Either VGA or hdmi, don't need both just one is fine.  Personally prefer glossy but matte is fine too. 

Although product sites have great reviews for quick pick laptops, actual personal review and YouTube review tells me con more than pros. As far as the design goes I like Msi GX60 the most. But I'd like to keep screen at 15.6""  thank you.

Budget: $1300.,8,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/18emyj/laptoptablet_for_a_us_student_gamer_budget_1300/,"I've been really stoked about the Surface Pro, but before I pick one of those up when they're available, I figured I'd check here. Basically, I'm looking for: 

* a small form, but preferably larger than the pro (11.5""-12.5""ish). 

* a very nice touchscreen for taking notes (like the Pro's digitizer). 

* a DECENT ability to play games - basically I'm fine if I can play most modern PC games, but I generally don't care whether they look spectacular. However, while 1080p is not necessary, ~40fps at, say 1366x768, is a must. I know this is difficult to assure though.

* full Windows 8. Preferably bundled.

* at least 1 USB 3.0 port. Preferably Bluetooth as well. 

* Video out. (HDMI / DVI / MDP)

Things not a huge factor for me: 

* Weight. Nothing this smallish will probably be too heavy to bother me. 

* Storage. Most of what I need is in the cloud, though I will need to be able to run installed games. 

* Battery life. 4-5hrs for note-taking and web-browsing is fine. Gaming I'll do with it plugged in.

* Country of purchase: United States

* Budget range: It's flexible since I'm more concerned with quality than price, but I'd like to keep it under $800 (usd). I'm aware that this rules out Apple products.

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): I want something fairly lightweight that's easy to carry around. I'll be using it mostly for coding (web dev, stuff for school, and some graphics, but nothing involved that would warrant special hardware). Secondary uses will just be the typical movies, reading, etc. More or less general purpose, with the exception of running VMs.

* Screen size preference: I want something small that still has normal-sized keys. I don't want a dedicated numpad, though. I'm pretty sure this puts me in the 11""-14"" range. I don't want to go bigger than 14 unless it's really special, or smaller than 11"" since that means I'm probably cutting other things that I want.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I don't care what comes on it, but I'll primarily be running Linux. Also, I can get Windows fro free through my university. With those two combined, if the seller/manufacturer offers an OS refund that'd be a plus.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Pretty much none. I may play some games on it, but like earlier, nothing heavy enough to warrant special hardware (Dredmor, Portal, maybe finally get around to playing Halflife, etc.).

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): I'm not sure if this fits here, but I need to be able to use at least 8gb of RAM since I'll be running VMs and would like to be able to give them a decent amount (of RAM). I don't care how much it comes with since I can easily add my own. That's another requirement - easily upgradeable is a major plus.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): I should be able to handle most things myself. (Both troubleshooting and hardware upgrades, and whatever else)

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I've got no loyalties - I just want a quality product.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Not particularly. I care a lot more about component and build quality and that it meets my other criteria than I do about appearance.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer?** (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: I think a balance here would be good. I want decent battery life, but since I'd like it to be conveniently portable/holdable I'd prefer to make that up with things like a smaller screen/other internals than by having a big, bulky battery.

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Definitely the quality side, but I'd prefer not to go too high. As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to stay under $800 (usd). That said, if you really, really think that spending 875 would get me something significantly closer to my ideal then don't hesitate to suggest it. If it's just something like ""This one's $950 but the USB ports are on the LEFT side!"" then you can let that pass.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: I'll probably have this on my lap enough that low noise/heat would be more valuable.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: Yes, definitely, but I read that as ""high relative to the display size"". 1366x768 isn't the same on an 11.6"" and a 14.4"" screen.

* A great keyboard: I'm not exactly sure what would make a laptop keyboard extremely good versus just okay, so unless you can give me an example that I could go try in a store then I'm not sure how much it would factor in (as long as it's not bad, of course).

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I say this below, but I want good buttons and a decent sized trackpad. I'm not willing to pay a huge amount for it, but if it was a small difference then I'd definitely pay it. I don't mind paying for things that will be worth it as far as usage goes.

* Great audio: This could mean two things. First, I don't care that much about the built-in speakers. I'd like them to be audible if I need to play something for other people, but beyond that it's not a big deal. I'll usually be using headphones or plug-in speakers when I want audio. Second, I do love music (I mostly listen to electro-house, DnB, and dubstep if that's relevant, though I doubt it is.), so I'd prefer that the potential sound quality not be terrible. I don't need anything like a nice dedicated sound card, or even really anything above average. I just don't want this to be the thing that gets completely chopped to accomodate everything else.

* *subsection tl;dr - The ranking is: screen, touchpad/mouse, audio, keyboard*

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

(no particular order)

* I don't need an optical drive of any kind. If i have a situation where I just really have to have one I'll get a USB external.
* A not-tiny trackpad. It doesn't have to be especially big, but I'd prefer it not be unusually small.
* Mouse buttons that don't require a lot of pressure.
* HDMI out
* USB 3.0 ports. I'd like two or more. One USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 might be okay if the rest of the package made it worth it.
* Comfortable to type on. I had a laptop years ago that had somewhat sharp edges, and with certain hand positions it got uncomfortable to type on before too long.
* Preferably SSD. I don't need a terabyte hard drive in it. Something at about 256gb would be plenty. I could go for 128 as well if it made a decent price difference, or something even cheaper (like a small platter drive) if I'd be better off just buying and installing my own SSD (I can get something decent on slickdeals eventually.).
* An ethernet port would also be nice, but isn't critical. Like the optical drive, if I absolutely have to have one I can go with USB.

Oh, and per the sidebar suggestion, I'm not looking for a desktop combo right now. In the future I'll build another one (I've done it before), but right now a laptop fits my needs better.

**Additional Section**

I've done some looking on my own using the sidebar links. Of what I've seen, the following models seem close to what I'm looking for. These are ranked in approximate order, not considering price. (Speaking of that, does anyone know a vendor that sells the Clevo models listed? I couldn't find one.)

* Clevo w130ew

* Clevo w130ev

* Asus Zenbook ux31a

* Clevo w110ew

* Sony VAIO S Series (SVS13122CXW)
