Sacramento is awesome.,109,22,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/ur0hj/whats_with_the_negative_attitudes_sacramento_is/,"I moved here two years ago after graduating with my music degree from a school in Statesboro, Georgia. These past two years I've spent spreading my wings, finding work here and there and meeting a host of incredible people. I've explored midtown, the bike trails, I know some cool hangouts and I've more or less learned the ropes of living in Sacramento. 

I subscribed to this subreddit maybe a month or so ago, and it's been a neat way to connect with folks in the same town. So - why all the ultra-negativity f@#$ing everywhere? It's not just here of course, it's indicative of some attitudes I've run into often enough since being here - people moping about how there's not enough to do, or that there's too many darn young kids running around having something to do, or there's too many hoodlums, or there's too many old conservative types, or whatever. I think people like that should spend a few years living in place like Statesboro, Georgia and come back here to see what a gem this place really is. We have everything. You can do anything. Whatever you're into - there's other people around that are into the same stuff. 

It's such a gift to live in Sacramento, and it just gets under my skin when I see people trying to bring everyone down to the notion that living in Sacramento is anything less than a golden opportunity you can either seize or not. Wherever this post goes from here, I'm happy for the chance to say this to a handful of folks who are reading this far. Carpe diem and all that shit. I hope I get to meet every one of you and that our lives are enriched by sharing this beautiful town.",,False,,t5_2qi09,False,,,True,t3_ur0hj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/ur0hj/whats_with_the_negative_attitudes_sacramento_is/,

She claimed to have just left the service because of an injury and she was a veteran. (she has her card, well I don't know if it was really hers now.) She says that shes looking for a place to stay in Old Placerville and that she needs to walk. I told her I would drive her. She told her story of how she was escaping with her two kids and that she just got in from Ohio yesterday. She just needs a place to stay for the night. She went to weave, but they couldn't help her without a police report. She said if she went back, her husband would kill her. She said that there was a hostel that she could stay in the night for $23.11. I told her I would pay for it. She told me that they don't accept third party payments, she even let me call and talk to someone, had all the pamphlets. She was probably the most convincing story i've heard.

well turns out the same exact woman told my boyfriend and other friends the same exact story. It's a scam. I had no problem giving the money away, the story that she tells is so heart wrenching that it actually hurt to hear that she lied. Oh, and I completely emptied out the last of my money to give it to her.

She's a short woman with short black hair. She was wearing glasses when I saw her. She's African american and looks about 40.

Well, I just figured I would let you guys know so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

I have personally witnessed questionable behavior from specific mod/mods such as unwarranted bans from this subreddit and unnecessary comments (""trolling""), just to name a couple.
I'm not here to point fingers but I am here to survey opinion and if we are not content then we can and should make a change.
I'm not oblivious to the potential this thread has of getting immediately deleted but I would think our mods should have enough integrity to allow their position to come under speculation. 

Sacramento subreddit, what say you?

EDIT: My friends, I'm pleased to see that you have voiced your concerns and a majority of you are ready to see this subreddit flourish. That brings a smile to my face, I love Sacramento, this is our home.
I would like to say thank you to PrivatMunky and Nautis for making an appearance here. I was honestly beginning to think all or most of our mods were gone. The general consensus seems to be there are too many mods for the size of this subreddit AND there are specific mods (withholding names) that have caused some grief. I suggest that we of r/Sacramento take care to communicate with our mods as our mods should take care to communicate with us. In addition, we can also contact reddit directly.

You had a lot to say [in a thread Monday morning](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/xr4u9/sacramento_reddit_are_we_happy_with_our_moderators/)! Based on what was shared there and in private messages with mods from community members,  here are a few changes we mods will making around here, effective noon  on Tuesday:**


* Removal of Mathewx5000 as a mod – on the grounds of their history of offensive interaction with the community

* Removal of AegisSC as a mod – on the grounds of their public bashing of Sacramento ~~and living outside of Sacramento~~ (**EDIT: AegisSC is still living in Sac- apologies for this inaccuracy**) and complaints of offensive interactions with the community

* Removal of Mods not active in r/Sac in the last week, and the commitment of current mods to check in with the community as frequently as possible, but no less than weekly.


**We will also be promoting (aka no longer removing) more “fun” things in the sub that are somehow related to Sacramento. This can mean as little as the posters being from/living in Sacramento and thinking others in Sacramento could find it interesting based on their familiarity with Sacramento. We'll enact the following guidelines to be posted in the sidebar for what kinds of posts are preferred:**


1. PLEASE SEARCH before posting! Especially when it's about ""Where are the best..."" kind of links. We have a lot of great advice out there already- make the most of it!

2. We like our news local! Try to keep stuff specific to Sacramento or of interest to other people because they also live in Sacramento

3. Meetups are fun! The more the better! If you don't like a venue, don't go! Try not to rain on each other's parades

4. We're all about supporting each other! But spammy (pro-business, non-special event focused) posts will be removed and spammy spammers will be banned

5. Use the downvote and report buttons for offensive, unconstructive comments! Help us mods mod!

**A few guidelines Mods will be using regarding banning:** 

1. Users that repeatedly post spammy (see above) material 

2. Users that have been repeatedly reported for derogatory, bullying, harassing or regularly downvoted comments will be warned once, then banned.

3. Threats of sexual, physical violence will NOT be tolerated and will result in a instant permaban.

**PLEASE report things! Mods are people with lives too, and if you feel like you have been wronged, or if you have any other comments or suggestions, we’d love to hear them and help you address them!**

**In closing, I want to encourage discussion and echo the sentiment of the author in an edit to the original thread:**

I'm looking for is a vote for the business I'm opening so I can get the signs made above my building because I cant afford it otherwise.

So photography is my passion. I have been doing photography and cinematography as a freelance artist for several years. I just opened my first physical location for an actual studio, and on weekends an art gallery for local artists in our community. The building is pretty old, built in 1899. Me and my father have been repairing the entire building, leaks on windows, repairing broken walls, peeling off wallpaper (so time consuming), peeling old paint, installing new floors, refinishing doors, trim, ceiling repair and plaster repair... we do all the work ourself with no loan, just slowing repairing it, all while paying the rent for the building.

Basically, I can't afford a sign that hangs over the building. I don't want money mind you. And for example, a small flat rectangular sign made of aluminum with our logo printed on it is over $1,000. But I entered a contest, 590 contestants total. Winner is determined by public votes. If I could get just a small amount of fellow redditors to toss a vote my way I could actually stand a chance to win. I don't have a sign at all over my business, and the other contestants, some really big established businesses, already have really good signs and signage on their buildings.

If you'd like to help me, you can go to the website below, you'll see an image of the outside of the building.

Its part Cafe part game-shop. Or least, that was the plan. Due to a bad landlord, the Gamer's Grind is in it's final days. He has started an Indiegogo campaign to try and save the store and raise money to purchase the remaining tools that he needs. This can be found at http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gamer-s-grind-board-game-cafe

He goes into all the details in his video of what happened with his previous landlord, his business model and his plan, so I wont bore you with the details. All that we ask is that you pass the info onto anyone you think would be interested. There are roughly 472,000 citizens in Sacramento, if we can get 6,000 (1.2%) of them to donate $10, our goal will be met, and this amazing place can continue.

""Now, random redditor, what is the Gamer's Grind and why do I care?"", you may ask. The Gamer's Grind is a board game cafe. Not many exist outside of Asia, but the basic idea is thus. The store is broken up into two parts, the coffee shop, and the game shop. (think Barnes and Nobels) You can stop by and get your favorite coffee drinks and be on your way, or you can stop in for a few hours to play on the wall of games. The wall of games is a massive wall of every board game imaginable. You pay the wall fee (currently $5) and get unlimited play time for the day.

""But I'm not really into board games."" 
A valid point, but let me ask. What board games have you played recently? Monopoly? Sorry? Uno? There are tons, literal TONS of other style board games out there. Currently, me and a few other in the board game community set up intro weekends at the Gamer's Grind. We invite anyone who is willing to give it a shot to come out and play some games with us.It's a fun, relaxing atmosphere.

""What about my family?""
The Gamer's Grind is the perfect place for family game night. You go to Target, spend $30-$50 on monopoly, and have to play that every week for 2 months. With the wall of games, you get to choose a different game every week, or even a few different games on one game night. It gets the family out of the house and you all get to have a good time. Is monopoly your thing? they've got 6 different types of monopoly. 

""But I hate my family.""
Drop the wife and kids off and go to the bar to get a drink. Then have them take a cab home. They get to have a good time, and don't remember that you smell of whiskey and regret! (I kid, I kid)



In Short, this is an amazing place that I would be saddened to see go, and am doing my best to get the word out about it. I think that, due to a run of bad luck, this place isn't getting the chance it deserves.

Here are the preliminary plans so far: 

* All day event; all ages during the day; evening will be TBD.

* McKinley Park 

* With an alcohol permit (I'm doing research now), we can set up a beer garden. I have a few contacts, and I'm ironing out the details about cost/permits (if you have any suggestions, feel free to PM me). 

* If it is as large as it was before (if not bigger, now that we're involving a broader age range), we'd have to get a permit. 

* I'm also getting an amplified sound permit, because I think we might want to get some live music going (DJs, bands, performers, etc).

I'll include photos from some other events I've thrown, and we'll work with that.

** TL;DR: *What do people NEED to do/see/eat to fully experience the Sacramento area?* **


I'm moving to San Jose in a few months and I was trying to find some cool things to do in San Jose. I was kinda disappointed to find how down people were on living there. It was mostly people thinking there wasn't anything to do out there. People [have asked us](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/g3bt2/hi_rsacramento_im_in_town_until_friday_for/)) and we've hooked them up! 

But what if we had a ""Bucket List"" of cool Sacramento experiences that lived here on Sacreddit? After seeing the sweet pics from the [Sacreddit meetup](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/gmr6o/hamburger_annies_meetup_pics/) this past weekend, I figure Sacreddit hivemind is teeming with awesome experiences that should be shared! *What kinds of things would you miss doing/seeing/eating if you moved away from Sac?*


I'll try to compile things from other posts as I find them here!

McKinley Park is confirmed. Let's shoot for around 1 or 2PM. Bring water guns, balloons, what-have-you. Frisbee's, basketballs, football - all welcome. 



Here's a map! [Map.](http://i.imgur.com/CJfr397.jpeg) 

I'm still working out the details for the post-park event - but if we're out there from, say, 1pm/2pm to about 8 or 9 - we can probably migrate on over to [Clarks Corner](http://www.clarkscornerbar.com/) - and after that, continue the party at a plethora of bars/restaurants around.  

What do you guys think of the plan?

1325231907.0,46,self.Sacramento,nw1mv,Two weeks ago my girlfriend was mugged and her bike was stolen. Yesterday morning we got it back.,54,8,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/nw1mv/two_weeks_ago_my_girlfriend_was_mugged_and_her/,"Leaving town ass early, we decided to stop for coffee. We get to the coffee shop at 6am. I chat with the barista, discover he's a reddit nerd too. I forgot my mug so I run back to the car to get it. I run into my professor and we chat for a minute. We get coffee and leave.

Two blocks away I catch a glimpse for a road bike with light blue grip tape. My girlfriends bike? We try to turn around and get stuck at the longest light in history. (I almost told my girlfriend to run the light, but there were cars coming that could have been cops.) We cruse through Oak Park for a few blocks, looking for anyone on a bike. Right at the edge of a park we spot it. My girlfriend whips the car around and I shout ""Hey! That's out bike!""

If any one of those random things in the first paragraph hadn't happened we would not have spotting the bike.

The guy with the bike (not the one who stole it) claims he bought it for $200. We offer him $200. My girlfriend never spends her Christmas money until she writes Thank You cards, so she had $200+ in cash. I step out of the car and carefully hold up two hundred dollar bills.

The man puts down the bike and starts to walk toward us. I say ""Bring the bike with you"". He replies, ""I ain't gonna play you man"". I'm firm and demand that he brings the bike to the car. He does. I hand him the bills and grab the bike. I say ""Sorry for not trusting you"" and shake his hand. He looks a little confused then walks into the park, disappearing into the darkness.

My girlfriend and I throw the bike in the car and get the hell out of there.
Later I learned she was ready with her pepper spray in case I got jumped.
Now my girlfriend tells her friends and family what a badass I was, how I showed no fear and got her beloved bike back.

tl;dr: Got stolen bike back, girlfriend thinks I'm badass.

(Note: Replacing the bike would have cost over a $1,000. Getting it back for $200 was a steal.)",,False,,t5_2qi09,False,,,True,t3_nw1mv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/nw1mv/two_weeks_ago_my_girlfriend_was_mugged_and_her/,

I see some cars getting back up to speed, people hanging out the window yelling at the car in front of them for daring to stop in front on them. I pull across the street and get in the left hand turn lane to do a U turn to go home. There is still a car stopped on the other side of the street, a man with his door open looking backwards at something. He yells to me, since I have my window down, about the chihuahua laying in the road 20 ft behind his car that was just hit by one of the cars in front of him. 

The man does not get out of his car, this whole time he's been stopped stopped there (probably about a full minute at this point).

He puts this whole thing on me. I jump out of my car, wrap the barely moving chihuahua in an extra shirt I have, trying to keep the dog's spine as still as possible, give him to my passenger, and haul ass to the vet no more than 1/4 a mile away on the same road the chihuahua was hit on. Sadly, he did not make it, nor does the chihuahua have any identification. 

I'm mad though, because the car that hit the dog, that clearly tried to avoid the dog from the screeching brakes and tire marks left, Just Drove away.

The next person, was thoughtful enough to stop, but was unwilling or unable to get out of his car, and **just drove away**.

People standing on the sidewalks did nothing but look on from the beginning, never even considered moving into the street to try and help the dog.

These people make me sick. Had the first car that hit the dog, or even the second did the same thing I did 2 minutes sooner than I was able, there was a chance that dog could have been saved. Still slim I know, but in trauma, seconds count. I know every single person out there that has ever owned a Animal would hope that someone would help theirs in a similar situation, yet everyone was willing to just walk away. 

People like that suck.

Edit: 
Someone ended up giving me 3 months of Reddit Gold in regards to this. If someone else has a similar inclination, please just donate that money to some worthy charity, animal or Human. I don't need Reddit gold.

Original Post:
&gt;I'm talking no-chain, totally local independent owned-and-operated pizza joints that were just awesome.
&gt;
&gt;I recall Zelda's downtown from my teen years, but I haven't been there in ages. Seven Sisters in Antelope/Citrus Heights area has amazing calzones.
&gt;
&gt;Whatcha got, Sac?
&gt;
&gt;Edit:
&gt;This is an awesome list guys, put together in less than a day. I'll try to keep updating it if more suggestions come in!
&gt;
&gt;Now to start trying them all...


The List:

Locations with direct websites:

* [7 Sisters](http://www.7sistersgf.com/) in Citrus Heights - Specializing in Gluten Free/special dietary needs, while still doing a very tasty calzone

* [Italian Brothers Pizza &amp; Pasta](http://www.italianbrotherspizza.com/)  in Citrus Heights

* [Chicago Fire](http://www.chicagofire.com/) - 4 different locations in Sacramento. All good, apparently.

* [Zelda's Pizza](http://www.zeldasgourmetpizza.com/) downtown - Very mixed experiences of customer service.

* [Masullo's Pizza](http://www.masullopizza.com/) on Riverside

* [LampPost in Elk Grove - looks like a California chain, not national]
(http://www.lamppost-backstreet.com/index.html)

* [Wenelli's Pizza](http://www.wenellispizzas.com/wenellispizzas.com/Welcome.html)

* [Pete's Restaurant and Brewery](http://www.petesrandb.com/)

* [Pizza Bell](http://www.pizzabell.net/) - Wilton/Elk Grove local business. No relation to Taco Bell.

* [Paesanos](http://paesanos.biz/)

* [Hot Italian](http://www.hotitalian.net/)

* [Hot City Pizza](http://eastsacpizza.com/) - possibly biased recommendation ;)

* [Extreme Pizza](http://www.extremepizza.com/) - semi-national chain, but I'll include it since it may not be well-known.

* [Wood Fired Pizza Company](http://woodfiredpizzacompany.com/) - A food truck that does pizza? That's pretty cool!
(available for catering and private parties... hmmmmm)

* [Pizza Rock](http://pizzarocksacramento.com/) - Possibly pretentious but good food.

* [One Speed Pizza](http://onespeedpizza.com/) in East Sacramento

* [Slice of Broadway](http://sliceofbroadway.com/) - Across the street from Tower Theater, good marks on customer service.

* [Giovanni's](http://giosnypizza.com/) on Folsom Blvd - Website loads a bit funny. Food noted to be good, except the calzone.

* [Pasquale's](http://www.pasqualessacramento.com/) on Fair Oaks

* [Rico's Pizza](http://www.ricospizzasacramento.com/)

* [La Riviera Family Pizza](http://larivierafamilypizza.com/) at Watt and La Riviera

* [Fat Mike's](http://www.fatmikespizza.com/index.html) in Wilton/Elk Grove

* [Giant Pizza](http://www.giantpizza.net/)

* [Roman's Pizza](http://romanspizza.powersites.net/) in West Sac

* [Selland Family Restarants](http://www.sellands.com/cafe-menus#pizzas) on H Street or El Dorado Hills - Menu includes quality wood-fire pizzas

* [Strobelli's Pizza](http://www.strobellispizza.com/) in Orangevale. Website may be broken.

* [Cool River Pizza](http://www.mycoolriverpizza.com/) in Roseville

* [Pannu's Pizza Palace](http://www.pannuspizza.com/) in North Natomas - The Tandoori Special pizza is especially recommended

* [Dominick's Italian Market &amp; Deli](http://www.dominicksmarketdeli.com/) located in Granite Bay or Folsom.

* [Tuli Bistro](http://tulibistro.com/index.html)

* [Celestino's Pizza](http://celestinospizza.com/rocklin.php) in Rocklin

Locations with no direct website:

* Luigi's on Stockton Blvd - Multiple recommendations, I better check this place out...

* Pieces Pizza by the Slice - downtown cash-only hole in the wall. If this is the same place I'm thinking of, it is AMAZING while staggering drunk. Then again, I was staggering drunk, so it might not be the same place... (Very mixed reviews about this place)

* El Primo on Northgate and W. El Camino - inhabited by Mexican karaoke?

* Royal Pizza on Northgate

1355101766.0,36,self.Sacramento,14krwa,Me and my friend stumbled across a bike theft sting last night downtown. Story inside.,50,14,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/14krwa/me_and_my_friend_stumbled_across_a_bike_theft/,"So last night me and my friend went to 19th and R Safeway around 2:45 am. I was on foot and he was on his bike. As we are locking up his bike at the bike locks we noticed that there was a bike just sitting in a parking spot. We mildly shrug it off and are like ""what idiots, who would do that"" The bike looked to be a somewhat decent cruiser bike. http://i.imgur.com/2sK72.jpg So we take a little longer locking up the bike because we expect someone to come out promptly get the bike or run off with it. After awhile of waiting we decided to go into the store, walking in we notice a second road bike just casually leaning on the wall. It was a fairly nice bike also, with no one around, just sitting there leaning on the wall. http://i.imgur.com/VTMB4.jpg At this point we are full of WTF as who would just leave nice bikes around like that. It didn't really fully hit us until we got in the store. Right by the entrance where they keep the rascal handicap scooter there was a man sitting on the scooter. He had a hood on and was African American. He was dressed exactly like you would imagine a plane clothed officer of the law to look. Normal sneakers, Normal jeans and a normal jacket. You could tell that he was obviously not homeless and well feed. I actually tried to say hi to him and he only glanced at me from under his hood. Now why would Safeway ever let some one just sleep or pretend to sleep in the store, right by the entrance, not 15 feet from the bikes. The next thing that really gave it off for us was that this was a really slow night at Safeway. There wasn't even a line at the check out. We were seriously the only people in the store besides the workers. This had us more curious as to who the unlocked bikes belonged to. So we pay and leave and decided to wait around and see if anyone either takes the bait, comes out of the store to get the bikes or the police tell us to leave for ruining their game. While talking we figure that they have the guy in the store ready to pounce so they must have some more cops or surveillance close by. Looking around the parking lot we spot in view of the bikes and entrance is a mini van, with completely blacked out windows on all sides front included. http://i.imgur.com/N0vGg.jpg After waiting and looking around there were some other suspicious cars but nothing as much as the van. So we wait and nothing really happens so we decide to leave before we get arrested for interfering. Before leaving we see at the bike locks directly in front of us something even more suspicious. Three really random bikes all locked together with one crap chain and shit lock. One was a really nice bike, the other normal then a really shitty pink one. No one was even in the store and you could tell that the bikes hadn't been rode. They had zero leaves, dirt, water or anything on the tires.http://i.imgur.com/FOO5B.jpg The whole 45 minutes to and hour that we were there, no one ever came for any of the bikes. I hope that they caught some bike thief though! If this is what was going on, which we are 90% sure of, Go Sac PD! Thanks.

Pros: 

* Really cute little duplex - perfect size for 1 person
* Very quiet and peaceful block yet still close to bars and restaurants
* In unit washer and dryer 
* Small dishwasher
* Small, tranquil shared back yard w/patio
* Nice front porch
* Good water pressure, good hot water

Cons:

* The acoustic insulation between the two sides of the duplex is not terribly good. You will hear me having sex, playing guitar and listening to music, but I do not generally do these things very late at night (except for sex, which lasts only a finite amount of time)
* The washer and dryer requires quarters despite being in unit, which is sketchy.

- Shoki Ramen House
- Roosevelt Park
- Leland Stanford Mansion

Fun game! I love geocaching and games like this. Let's see some more!
Oh, I left it where I found it in case someone else is looking.

Okay guys.  This game is evolving because frankly, this is my first time doing anything like this and I've gotten some great feedback from the community.

First:

No more selfies.  But please do take a picture of the chip where you found it.

Second:

If you do decide to go hunting, just post in the thread where your starting from (general area).  Again, you don't have to take a picture.

I currently have 50 chips and plan on running this game at least 50 times.  Every time a chip is found, a new one will be hidden.  Please tell me some clues I should include.  Also, obviously the camera angle was too tight, how far back should I shoot from.

Anyway, here's what you've probably come from.  Here's the new clue!

**Place:** Initially [The Grand](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-grand-wine-bar-sacramento), then can move anywhere (I'd recommend [Firestone Public House](http://www.firestonepublichouse.com/) so we can allow the 18+ crowd to join, while not alienating us drinkin' folk.

This is Thumper. He is an overweight 3 year old lap cat. He has two different colored eyes and a soft coat. He is a very indoor cat, as in he wouldn't last 5 minutes on the outside. Hobbies include napping and eating, that's about it. This lovely little guy comes with his own litterbox and a fresh bag of litter. Thumper is not very sociable with other pets, but given time he'll likely warm up to them. He also has occasional schizophrenic fits where he howls and sprints across the room for no reason. It's adorable.

He needs to find a home by the 31st, so please PM me for more info about this fuzzy guy and/or you are interested in giving him a home.",,False,,t5_2qi09,1357430880.0,,,True,t3_15lt6i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/15lt6i/cat_needs_a_new_home/,

Watch out for this guy!,40,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/14h2dn/con_artistpanhandler_guy_in_midtown_watch_out_for/,"When I first moved to Midtown almost a year ago, I was unfortunate enough to think depositing money in my account at an ATM (On Alhambra ) at 1:30am was a good idea. This guy came up to me and gave me a big long story about how he had gotten into an accident ""Just over there!"" with his family, was now getting kicked out of the hospital, and was 8$ short for his motel room! Could I help? I'll admit how sketchy that sounds, but I had just moved from the suburbs, and decided 8$ wasn't a stretch just in case this guy was telling the truth. He ended up pretty much pinning me against the wall and getting 30$ out of me before running off. It wasn't exactly a mugging as there was no weapon, but he got quite aggressive and was obviously going to take the money if I didn't give it to him.  Yes, now I feel like ""Sheltered College Freshman"" and no you don't need to tell me how retarded I was to even open my wallet in front of this guy. I'm aware. There's a part two to this. 

Today, while walking down 26th towards Broadway the same guy approached me, gave me the exact same story and tried to get more money out of me. I obviously didn't give this time, but it got me thinking that this MUST work for the guy if he's doing it almost an entire year later. 

So I just wanted everyone to know about the guy. If you're naive (like I was), or just kind hearted enough to figure that 8$ isn't much to help some guy who is obviously trying to crack his nut, you have now been warned. 

He's probably 40-45, Stocky, and African American and bald. Today he was wearing a fedora, last time he wasn't. He produced a piece of paper with details about an accident written on it, but it was a KCRA webpage printout that looked like it had seen a lot of miles. I even tried looking for a timestamp, but there wasn't one. 

Just want people to be safe and watch out for themselves. Happy Holidays! 

TL;DR Watch out for a guy using a fake accident story to try and get you to give him money. He will get aggressive.

I'm 23, and unfortunately, negative family dynamics has forced me to leave home w/o having been able to save up any money for a place of my own before leaving. This has happened several times before, but the family relationship is too toxic and neither side is capable of the change necessary to be able to live together under the same roof. The relationship is fine when not in the same house, but it's just been time to go out on my own for too long now and the only way it can happen is if I put myself in this situation of necessity and grow on my own 2 feet. What I'm asking for is some help with where I can spend my time and be productive and useful on a daily basis.  I'm actively seeking employment and do have a couple of friends that will let me use their places to stay cleaned up and groomed. Best case scenario is of course a paid position, and if there is anybody in the Sacramento area that could use a helper for your labor position that I can be compensated for that would be incredible. I do have slight experience in roofing, auto body repairs, and installing and repairing automatic garage doors. Also, if there is anybody that needs a part-time volunteer for your business, organization, or anything, then please, send me a message. Money is definitely a necessity, but having somewhere to go consistently so I can have some stability and comfort in knowing where I'm going each day is my immediate goal. Lastly, if anybody knows of any homeless shelters, housing, churches that I can go to if ever in a bind, that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks for the support and great ideas in the [last post about doing something good for our community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/xugma/what_do_you_say_we_move_past_all_the_argybargy_in/).  I think we should follow through on them eventually: clothes drive, blood drive, autism walk, and others.  

For the time being, we're going with the most upvoted suggestion by MatthewX5000 and focusing on school supplies for local teachers.

**Another fellow redditor I know volunteers at a local non-profit, [RAFT - Resource Area For Teaching](http://www.raftsac.org/).  They help fabricate inexpensive supplies for local teachers. I'm told that the school districts give teachers credit to gather and shop for supplies at this organization.** 

The more support RAFT gets from the community, the cheaper teaching supplies become for our teachers. 

There are multiple ways to support RAFT:

* **Donate money** - we can do this through their website and follow up for a total tally of how much our subreddit donated)

* **Donate supplies** -  [RAFT has a wishlist]( http://www.raftsac.org/images/stories/New_Donation_Materials_List_for_RAFT2.pdf) of surplus supplies they ask for from local businesses.  We could organize a meetup to collect some of these common materials and drop them off.

* **Volunteer** - Like I mentioned, a fellow redditor volunteers here.  You can donate your time by actually helping fabricate teaching materials. We could organize a day for several of us to go out there.

If we decide to do any or all three of these options, we should coordinate our efforts here in the thread in order to have the most impact.
 
Let me know what you think.  Thanks again!

*Disclaimer:  I’m in no way affiliated with RAFT.  The sac sub voted on supporting local teachers, so I picked this organization by word of mouth and after reviewing their website.* 

**EDIT:  Some in the thread have suggested donating supplies directly to a local needy school.  If the community would rather do that, please suggest a school.  We'll go ahead and pick the most upvoted school and then coordinate a supply drive, perhaps make a meetup or two out of it.**

* Better public transportation that is simple for non locals to use

* A district with lots of good restaurants and shopping (maybe where the proposed arena was planned)

* Use of many empty buildings in Downtown

* K street mall getting a face lift (probably goes with the 2nd point)

I don't like any of the recent book selections (mostly christian based since the new members came in, which is cool once in a while but not something i want to do all the time), and the discussions devolved to general personal drama/negativity. 
I'm thinking it would be cool to get a group to meet up every month or so, try out different sacramento area restaurants, and chat about the book of the month/life. 
Thoughts?:) 


**edit 1- anyone interested please pm me your email address as well as a book that you'd be interested in reading. I'll give it a couple of days and then email everyone with the book suggestions, and from there we will take a vote on what to read first and when/where to meet :)**


**edit 2- an email has gone out to everyone who provided me with their e-mail address. (if you already provide and email but ive missed you please let me know!) There are 5 book options, and I will be setting up a surveymonkey site where we can vote on the book choice, as well as times days and location for our first meeting. Thanks so much to everyone who's participating, please let me know if you'd like to be added to the mailing list.**

**Edit 3- Alright, we have a survey monkey! Even if you have already submitted your book/time/day/location preferences to me via email please resubmit this info on the [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/S7FKH6D) so that all of the info will be neat and tidy in one place :) Thanks!**

If you are currently on the mailing list and do not plan to participate please contact me via email so that I can remove you from the list and get a better idea of how many of us plan to participate :) A few things that came up during the survey: 
1. Tuesday/7pm/once monthly looks like the most popular selection. Some of you have expressed interest in having a set meeting agenda ahead of time. I will go ahead and write one up as soon as the survey is closed. (It is closing this sunday, so please cast your votes prior to then.) Right now two books are tied for first, the Dog Stars and Devil in the white City, so unless there is an upset in survey land we will likely be reading those as our first two books. We will be reading and discussing one complete book per month, with something of an open format for dialogue. (Think socratic seminar minus the debate....... scratch that, I'm sure some of us will have opposing viewpoints.) In my experience, specific discussion questions can be somewhat limiting. Guidelines can be helpful, though, and I would encourage everyone to come prepared with themes in mind for discussion. At the end of each meeting I would like to select the next meeting location(either by discussion and vote or all writing our choice on an index card and drawing from a jar).

I'm going to list places I've tried and would definitely recommend and also places I've just heard great things about.

In no particular order:

* Gatsby's.  Everything is locally grown/made, so a lot of the specialty burgers are seasonal.
  
* Flaming Grill.  Tons of meat options, great for daring people.  Beer selection is pretty big for such a small place, mostly patio seating.

* Formoli's.  Whiskey burger is not served on weekends after Friday 5 pm.

* The Broiler.  American Kobe burger.

* Krushburger (formerly Miniburger Truck).  3 main slider options, usually a special run during the month

* Pizza Rock.  2 American Kobe burgers on the menu (honestly this is my current favorite).

* Willie's.  They are famous for their chilli burgers.

* Jamie's. Hole in the wall made overly famous by DD&amp;D.  

* Dad's Kitchen.  Their burger is made with blue cheese and bacon and built a little different.  

* Nationwide Freezer Meats.  Oddly named.

* Squeeze Inn.  Got sued a few years back and ended up expanding into a Sacramento chain.  Unique cheese skirt is a Sacramento legend.

* Burgers &amp; Brew.  

* Scott's Burger Shack.  Little place in the bad(ish) part of town, but I've heard great things about it.  Outdoor seating only.

* Ford's.  Nice little spot across from William Land Park.

* Fannie Anne's.  Great place in Old Sac to just visit, lots of history and neat things to look at while eating.

* Village Drive In.  Old school looking place.

* Juno's on J st., Blair Robertson (Sacbee) recently called their burger the best he'd ever had in Sacramento. American Angus beef, brioche.

* Crepeville.  Keep hearing about the burger, surprising considering their HUGE selection of crepes.

* Tower Cafe.  Most people complain the food is boring except the burger.

* Jim Denny's.  Itty bitty place with supposedly a lot of heart.  

* Burger Junction.  Sort of out of the way (Florin and Power Inn) but very old school, family owned place.  Hosts an old school car show pretty much every Saturday night during the warm months of the year.

* The Hideaway.

* Golden Bear.  Cheese is actually in the center of the burger!

California is the best state. This is just Rhubarbbus' humble opinion, but California wins. We have literally EVERYTHING! There is no state that exceeds us in any way.

I've been told that California lacks that small town charm. It's a big ass state we have tons of small towns. We have San Francisco, which is like baby Manhattan. We have L.A., a totally one of a kind city. We even have some of the worst ghettos, Oakland/Compton. Want to settle down? Come to Sac, we have so much suburb. Home of the technological revolution. Some of the best schools. HOLLYWOOD! We just have it going on.  

We make more food than any other state, largest economy of all the states. Geographically one of the most diverse areas on the planet. Some of the tallest mountains, lowest valleys, deserts', forests', fucking everything.

Ever since I got my Audi A3, my cousin got his Audi A4, and my brother got his Mazdaspeed3, we've been trying to look for fun drives around the area.  We just did one this past weekend in the Walnut Grove/Isleton area, around their levee roads along the river.  Really fun (lots of straightways, some fun turns, barely any stop signs/lights, and really open) and it was pretty scenic.  It was nice, too since it was only about 10 minutes out from my apartment in Laguna.  

We're planning on going up to the Avenue of the Giants drive, which I think is like 5 hours from San Francisco, 2 hours from the Oregon border, but I'd like to do some the local routes first.  

And no, we're not reckless when we do these drives.  We like to keep it safe for us, the passengers in our cars, and for everyone around us.

Post park events update! 

Thanks to /u/wonderboy82, we've now got drink specials for redditors at Clark's Corner. Keep in mind; we're even keeping this place 18+ as well; but you WILL be carded at the bar - so no funny business. ;)

I'll post an update THE DAY OF on what the specials are and how to get them. I don't want randoms finding out; and then ruining it for all of us. Keep your eyes peeled on /r/sacramento/new so you don't miss out. Or just find me at the meetup, and I'll tell you in person. 

Keep in mind; if you have too much to drink, call a cab. Here's a list: 

**Yellow Cab:** (916) 444-2222 

**Taxi Dave!:** (916) 862-0445 

**King Taxi:** (916) 441-KING

**Steve's Towncar Service:** (916) 591-2691

**If you need a goddamn cab, call one.**

**The Benefits.**

* I'm clean. Dishes, trash, general mess always picked up within 24hrs of being made.
* 47"" Flat screen. 'nuff said.
* XBOX360 with Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. 
* I've got all the furniture. Couches, chairs, entertainment center. I've also got all the dishes and cooking ware
handled. 
* I'm not very loud.
* Non-smoker.
* Costco member!
* I have a dog, which everybody loves.
* I'll help you move!


**Apartment Details:**

* 2 bed / 2 bath 
* Living room
* Dining room (is currently an office)
* Full kitchen (dishwasher, sink, microwave, oven, fridge)
* Downstairs (and the upstairs neighbors barely exist)
* Endless parking in front of apartment
* Washer and Dryer


**The Apartment Complex Amenities:** [Rocklin Manor Apartment](http://www.rocklinmanorapts.com/)

* Pool
* Gym
* Tons of parking
* Across (literally adjacent) from Sierra College
* High capacity washers and dryers


**The Bills:** To be split evenly every month.

* Rent: $911/mo
* PG&amp;E: ~$65/mo
* Water &amp; Trash: ~$30/mo
* Blazin' 18mb/s internet!!: $50/mo
* HuluPlus, Netflix, Amazon Prime streaming, XBOX Live: $0.00 (I won't charge you a penny to use these, but I don't want to pay for cable)

*TOTAL:* $1056/mo = $528.00 each. 

This is pretty affordable, in my opinion. Food is as cheap as you make it. I'm a pretty frugal shopper, and Costco definitely helps.

**The Bad:**
* I have a dog (might be bad if you're allergic, but he's hypo-allergenic anyway)
* I technically have the master bedroom. Your room would be bigger than mine, but disconnected from your bathroom. 

**My rules:** More like common courtesy, really.
* Dishes and trash dealt with within 24hrs 
* Don't eat ALL my food. I do share a lot, though
* No stealing
* No smoking inside
* If you drink, don't be destructive. 

If you even THINK you would be able to move in, please send me a private message. If you know anyone that is looking for an affordable place, let them know!

I'll answer any questions in the thread or in PMs

The restaurant will close during the construction work and reopen with a 1950s-style look and burgers-and-shakes menu by late April or early May, says a spokesman for the ownership group.  The Lyons chain has been going through hard times and has lost a lot of luster, says the spokesman, who asked to be anonymous.

&gt; WOW! Two Words…. Inspired and tired, what a day! We would like to thank Levani and her family for making today a record-breaking day at Front Street. Levani set a goal of collecting 1,000 pounds of pet food and to help a few pets get adopted. Thanks to the tremendous support from our community she was not only able collect over 1,500 pounds of food, we also shattered our single day adoption record by sending 47 animals to their forever homes!! (there are also many more on hold for tomorrow!) 

&gt;Thank you to the adopters who were so patient and waited hours to finalize adoption paperwork. We feel this story is far more important than just a single food drive and this one animal shelter. Levani took action and became the change that she wanted to see in her community. We believe the valuable lesson to be learned is that no one is too small to make a BIG DIFFERENCE!

Here's the link to the page with all the information about reserving a room: http://saclibrary.org/?pageId=1593
In addition to meetups, an individual or group could reserve a room to offer a free lesson, lecture, musical performance etc. to build up experience/confidence/exposure.  
  
Edit: Wow, this captured more attention than I anticipated. I'll try to answer questions to the best of my ability.  
  
There are two links, one covering the guidelines for using the community rooms: http://saclibrary.org/file/591.pdf; and one covering amenities offered at different branches: http://saclibrary.org/file/592.pdf - as I understand it, Belle Cooledge's community room hours should be changing if they haven't already to be available later than branch open hours. Regarding library rules, they may differ from branch to branch; I've only been to a few. Whoever is going to be the one to take on the responsibility of reserving a room should call and inquire about details and any specific questions you have.
  
I'm almost certain you can bring in outside food and drink but no alcohol. I say 'almost' because I don't know if there are any particular foods or amounts deemed excessive that are disallowed. Again, I suggest calling to inquire about details at particular branches.  
  
I have heard that requests to use the community rooms for birthday parties are typically denied. I think the requests are usually made by parents to host parties for their children, and not by adults for themselves to be open to all the public. What I'm trying to say, is that maybe there's a way in which to request use of community rooms for birthdays that will receive a green light, but I don't know what it is.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We should be in the Sacramento area in mid-December.

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

Nothing we have will ever be on the scale of NYC, SF, LA, or LV--nor will it be for 99.99999999% of the country. However, I happen to believe that Sacramento has at least one or two remotely similar offerings of whatever orgasmic experiences you've had elsewhere. 

Enlighten me or prove me wrong. 

And yes, proximity DOES count and should not be invalidated as a major pro for living here. You cannot go snowboarding in LA or 4 wheeling in Manhattan.

Just visiting some friends in Elk Grove, California for New Years and to watch Sunday football.  Put my dogs up in the back yard and head out to dinner.  From dinner to party, from party back to the house by 12:30am, and the dogs have both vanished.  Found a hole under the fence that they easily could fit through.  They've been in this yard at least a dozen times and either they never got out before or the Great Dane that our friends dog sat for recently attempted an escape - but the only dogs missing are mine.  Searched for hours but no sign of them.

I can only hope someone picked them up.  Maybe a redditer... a redditer that reads Sacramento.  Also cross posted on Craigslist.  They have tags with my old number on them and the number is disconnected.  :(  They also have their licenses for Red Bluff.

I thought it would be fun to have a swim meetup, so I threw the word out last week. We decided on this Sunday (the 14th) around 1pm, if that's cool with you guys? I had thrown the idea around of meeting by River Rat, but I think Paradise Beach would be better. Why?

**-River Rat** is usually pretty crowded, the current is pretty strong and it's a bit shallow, then just drops off. Maybe not totally safe.


**-Paradise Beach** (by Glen Hall Park) is kind of an alcove, so there's no current, it's a bit shallow, but you can wade out and it's actually a beach.

I'll be posting a little map and some pictures today (as I will be going swimming at Paradise Beach today). I'll also post a couple signs because the beach can be kind of a pain in the ass to get to. If you'd like to go, I'll message you my number, in just in case anyone gets lost or has any questions. 

I'm super excited and I hope to see a lot of people there!! :)

I've included a few links and photos on how to get there, etc. I will message the people who said will go my number, just in case they have any questions. ~~User [julie_DLT](http://www.reddit.com/user/julie_DLT) will need a ride she (I'm assuming she's a she) lives in Orangevale off 50 and Hazel.

Normally I hand wash my car, but I'm stuck at an apartment right now that has decided to turn off all the outside water, had to drive my car through the rain one day, got nasty dirty, decided finally to give up and try the ""Touchless"" carwash at that Chevron which was a major mistake.

There are these pressure washers that come down and swing back and forth in front of you car, they came down and just kept coming, and started **SCRAPING** up the hood of my car, metal nozzle on paint.  Needless to say, there is a pretty deep gouge in the hood of my car when I get to pull through and take a look to see whats going on, I pull around, park, and go in to speak with the staff about the issue.

Ouch that's a nasty gouge!

[http://i.imgur.com/92S4h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/92S4h.jpg)

I have never had such horrible customer service, who I later learn is the manager, comes out to inspect the damage and says its ""***obviously***"" pre-existing, we're talking, big chalky white gouge on a still damp silver hood that catches your nail when you run over it.  I asked for the owners number to take it up with them, so the manager gives me their number, which was actually the number for that Chevron location instead, and tells me to call for ""Pal"" at 8am.  I did ask if they would review the video footage from the car wash, they flat out refused, they even said they couldn't because they weren't the manager, even though they were the manager!

I call at 8am, they say call at 12 noon, I call at 12 noon, they say call in 30 minutes, I call in 30 minutes and get the manager, tell him who I am, he hangs up immediately.

At this point, I call my insurance company back, had just got off the phone with them, and tell them I'm going through with the claim, I'll go get some quotes to see if its more than my deductible.  Insurance says they'll go through legal channels and pursue the gas station on my behalf.

Head on down to Hayes Brothers, go get a quote...

[http://i.imgur.com/PtlL9.png](http://i.imgur.com/PtlL9.png)

Well, that's a lot more than my deductible!

What the FUCK? If these guys had just fessed up and had their insurance sort the problem out, had the owner get in touch with me, or hell, even talk to my insurance company when they called, this wouldn't be such a big issue, but now I'm sure they're looking at getting their balls twisted over it by my insurance who will want to recoup every last cent then some.

This Chevron station is totally horrible, so here is your PSA, screw this gas station, they're well and truly horrible.

Oh, and a few shots of the car which should make it more obvious why I'm getting the nasty ass scratch fixed.

According to a resident that I asked, these have been sitting idle since the developer went bankrupt about 5 years ago. Four of them are all on their own, set back from the rest of the development behind a prison-style double fence complete with razor wire. On that property sits 5 or 6 greenhouses, in various stages of completion. We asked around to everyone we could and it seems that after the bankruptcy happened a medical marijuana nursery was to be built there. The nursery owners bought or leased (not sure) the land, put up the double fence and built brand new greenhouses. Then the feds intervened and that project stalled. Doubly tragic. I did a bit of research and apparently the new development was tied into the existing water and sewer infrastructure without updating it, and it never would have worked if they were sold.


The sad thing is, these new houses are pretty much identical to some of the in-fill projects we've all seen in midtown Sacramento. To someone with the ability to move these they could be relocated and fit perfectly amongst the Craftsman, Queen Anne and Victorian-style houses of midtown/downtown. The electrical meters were never even installed in service boxes, and the windows all have their manufacturer stickers on them. It's all at once creepy, tragic and cool.

 Before you guys yell at me, I have already read through all the moving threads and searched through reddit.  I could not find any discussions regarding this apartment complex. 

  I'm moving to Sacramento at the end of July and I am trying to find a place to live.  The hard part is I'll be moving in without visiting. 

The wife and I have decided to live in the Pocket area because of great child care/schools/location etc.  

We originally found a place called Southwood Townhomes but since then I've found some negative things about that place and it is no longer on my radar. 

Now we are looking at Sycamore Terrace, it is located at 40 park City Court..

Everything looks good from where I'm at, but you guys are in the heart of it.  I would love to know if anybody knows anything about the location, the child care nearby, the schools, the neighborhood, places to eat, shop, hang out, bike ride, anything and everything.

1341936111.0,15,self.Sacramento,wbzku,As a proponent of professional sports in Sacramento I've gotta ask...,19,4,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/wbzku/as_a_proponent_of_professional_sports_in/,"I was reading an article today about Kevin Johnson's desire for the MLB when I saw a comment that really irked me and simultaneously inspired this post:

**Random derp:** 

""One more example of Kevin Johnson's monumental ego and self absorption it looks like. He is not in it for the People of Sacramento or even the Region around Sacramento but rather for himself, his thug cronies and the money they can rape from the rest of us. Those who helped him stay in Office need to be ashamed of themselves and accept responsibility for the harm that they and their complacency in his being re elected have, are, and will cause for all of us.""

**My response:**

""I'm not sure how acquiring a professional sports franchise for the city of Sacramento is reflective of Johnson's ego especially when the grassroots #herewestay, #herewebuild, #thinkbigsacramento movements encouraged his desire for pro sports here in cow town. People who are more interested in city services such as the police/fire departments, schools, parks, pools, etc. have gotta realize that they do not generate our government the same kind of revenue as having the NBA or MLB here in Sacramento. Having pro sports in town is an investment in more way than one: leasing a city owned arena generates millions annually (which would have been the case with the Kings' rail yard arena), visiting teams have contracts with travel agencies/hotels/security/etc, small/big businesses will benefit from patrons who want to go out for drinks/food before and after games which is essential to our local economy, also the multi-millionaires (team owners, GM's, athletes) living in Sacramento are a source of tax-income for our government... Need I say more?

I mean yeah it's not as romantic of Johnson to be chasing the MLB, NHL, or NBA over said services but it's an investment above all else and your incendiary rhetoric is both unwarranted on Johnson's behalf and reflective of what seems like a publicly degenerative attitude when it comes to Sacramento's fiscal future.""

**Fire Hydrants** - Everyone knows not to block one, but tickets are flowing for parking within 15 feet (a full car length) on either side.  This is for hydrants that aren't marked as a red zone.  **This is a steep $100 ticket, and damn near impossible to contest**, even if the hydrant is accessible (and you parked 10 feet from it) or hidden, or isn't a painted red zone.

**Blocking Sidewalks (Rolled curbs)** - Basically, if you have any part of your tire over the line of the rolled curb on the side walk, you can be ticketed for blocking a sidewalk.  And we're talking a few inches of tire.  A few neighbors have had a mere couple of inches of tire over the line and were ticketed, in front of their own houses, at night.

Most of these were issued at night, so be aware that there are parking enforcement officers itching to issue tickets when you least expect it.

I was the victim of a straightforward debit account fraud over a month ago for a little over $300. It's taken me over 10 hours on the phone with Bank of the West, 8 visits to various branches to correct the fraud and finally close the account. I can't recall one time I got a call back when I was supposed to or within any sort of reasonable time frame.

When closing the account at the downtown branch I told them that the final balance wasn't right and to check again because I was telling them that they credited for the fraudulent charge twice. The account rep said no, it was indeed correct, I told them it wasn't and to check again, the rep then said that it's correct.

I figured whatever, I'm closing the account, I needed to get back to the office and I did due diligence, right? If BOTW can't keep their shit straight (which they by this point have obviously proven they can't) it's not my problem. 

So I get back to the office after taking a longer lunch break than I would have liked and within 10 minutes I get a call telling me that I was given too much when I closed the account and would I be so kind as to come on back to the branch and bring it back.

Within 10 minutes... That's right, when the customer needs them to fix something, it takes over a month, but when they screwed up and it'll cost them money, they get right on it.

Anyways, yes this is just a ranting post, but I needed to get it off my chest. Hopefully if someone is looking for a new bank in Sacramento, they might see this post and make the informed choice and choose any other bank but Bank of the West.

Dennis, a 46-year-old Florida man who serves as the search and rescue director for the KlaasKids Foundation, said a team leader discovered the body and immediately called police. Marianne Lomax, who was nearby, and other volunteers were quickly steered from the area, Dennis said.
http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/08/4799115/womans-body-found-near-river-during.html

However, today the Lomaxes are claimed it was Marianne (the mother) who found the body. 

The mother's description of smelling the body in Glenn Hall Park and following her nose to her daughter's corpse also seems unlikely. That park and those trails are heavily used every day. And yet no people and none of the many offleash dogs noticed the decomposing body?

I also feel like the father, Craig Lomax, is wayyyy overinvested in publicity. I mean, at this point, holding more and more press conferences serves no purpose. And always holding them at his church? The church seems more like a cult than a regular church, the more I read about it. 

Have I been watching too many forensic shows? It just doesn't add up.

In the end, I hope Linnea found peace.

Of course we're both familiar with places like Jack's Urban Eats and Whole Foods, but we're looking for a bit of variety. We both love cooking and home and do so often, but on the off chance we're both tired and don't feel like cooking, we'd love a place that isn't our standard (albiet glorious) Pizza/Mexican/Chinese fare. Neither of us are very picky either, so any types of ethnic cuisines (though he's not all that big on Thai...) are welcome. Preferably places that are close, but since we're somewhat central, recommendations near downtown/midtown, Roseville, Arden and Citrus Heights would also be great.

Dear Maloof Family,

I had a dream last night.  It was a really nice dream about Sacramento.  The Kings were still hear, and we had a new arena. Cliche' I know.  But the funny part was that you guys were loved all around Sacramento.  In fact, the Maloof Family name was one of the most favorable and trusted names in the area.  Everyone loved you guys, and the Kings were a premiere team. Then I woke up and it saddened me to realize it was only a dream.  But the real sad part is that this dream could so easily be a reality.  And a very soon reality.  

I love the Sacramento Kings.  I like them more than I like the sport of Basketball.  Watching the Kings play is one of my favorite things to do.  But since all this talk about moving, the mood has just been down.  Attendance is down, moral is down, and being a Kings fan is a joke. It truly is embarrassing to say I am a Kings fan.

My only wish is to tell you one thing.  That if you stayed in Sacramento and invested in us, I promise, you would get returns on your investments that you could never imagine in your wildest dreams.  Yes we are a small town, but we are strong.  But only as strong as ownership shows. That's you guys.  If you showed a commitment for the long term future, it would not only bring us back, I would be PROUD again to say I am a Kings Fan.  Figure it out guys, or else you just wasting time.  I know people say you guys don't have money, but you guys own a FUCKING NBA team.  I'd say that's worth quite a lot.  All it will take is your first step.

If this letter ever found you, I hope you seriously think about the potential future. I wish only the best for The Sacramento Kings.


Sincerely,

fan",,False,,t5_2qi09,False,,,True,t3_14prnq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/14prnq/open_letter_to_the_maloof_family/,
