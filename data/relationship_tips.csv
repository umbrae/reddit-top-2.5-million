I use all kinds of pet names with the Mrs - a lot of the time I just call her ""beautiful"" - like ""What do you need, beautiful?"" That kind of thing. I never thought much of it - I just say it because I think she's, well, beautiful...

Last night she told me that it means so much to her that I always call her beautiful - it really makes her feel that way, even when she's having an off day.

1334973297.0,72,self.relationship_tips,skpfv,Relationship Tip: Will solve pretty much everything,84,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/skpfv/relationship_tip_will_solve_pretty_much_everything/,"There are 3 main points to this post.

1. **If you're not happy in the relationship, either talk it over with your partner, or gtfo**. I always suggest, before breaking up for what ever the reason is, is to talk it out with your partner. If you're a guy who likes watching gay porn, and she gets offended when a 3some comes on, or WHAT EVER THE CASE IS, talk about it with your partner; However, if it doesnt work out, and you cant manage to solve the issue that is making the relationship stressful/unenjoyable, then I say end it. Mind you, these are for big issues, not something like: you like leaving your socks on the floor. With every relationship, you/your spouse are going to have to change something to make it all work out.


2. **Never get back with your ex. You broke up for a reason, so stick with it**. I made the mistake of getting back with my ex... several times... and every single time, I came out bruised. Even to this day, over 1/2 a year ago, I'm still miserable about what happened last. But, the best way to move on is to ignore them, and start dating other people (if the case may be it). I know how it feels to break up with one of those other people that knows pretty much everything about you, and you have a bunch of inside jokes with them, etc. But you have to move on.


3. **If he/she actually likes you, they wont care about most things you normally do/like, or even will like the same things you do**. If you have to change your normal self, then there is a bit of an issue. For example: if I am talking with this one girl, we hit it off one night, start dating and she finds out I love playing Xbox/PS3, and she cant stand it, it goes back to my 1st point of talking it over. If you feel that you cant live without your xbox/PS3, and she wont accept it, gtfo. Its WAAYY harder to get a girl to like you by pretending to be who she wants you to be, than to be your actual self. You will find a girl 1000x more attractive if she is into what you're into.


And that's it. If these tips don't solve your problem, its a case-by-case scenario. Think it over, weigh the odds, don't plan TOO much on what you want to say because 9 times/10 its not going to happen that way, and just relax. There's more people out there than there is with that one person.


**EDIT:** There are, and always will be exception to these tips. Eg. If you decide to get back together with your ex, things may get better.

**EDIT2:** I was reading a few posts online about more relationships. And going back to point 2, [beerme72](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/t624q/if_i_ever_had_to_hit_a_bitch/c4juj7t) made a comment about going through a bad relationship:

&gt;As a person that has a few years on you (I turned 40 two weeks ago), I can tell you that I've seen woman like THAT ruin men with million dollar businesses. I've seen woman like THAT ruin families and lives. And while this may ring hollow now, you're SO much better off without her.
She's the worst kind of person.
Go listen to some good Delta Blues with a good bottle of Bourbon and some friends, get her OUT of your system (like a good healthy greasy shit) and walk away.
You'll be a much stronger man because of this.

When They Don’t Love You Back
FEB. 11, 2013 By CHELSEA FAGAN	 


There’s a strange feeling that sometimes overcomes us when we’re reaching out to someone, this feeling of acute embarrassment. “Are we bothering them?” we ask ourselves, and almost wanting to apologize for even sending a message in the first place. It’s as though our very presence in their lives is a nuisance, and our efforts to connect as friends or lovers is one that only complicates things for them. We want to say, “I’m sorry that I want to talk to you, it’s weird and I should probably stop.”

The thing is, you can feel when you’re bothering someone. It’s not difficult to tell when you are the one who is always reaching out, always initiating contact, always starting the conversation. You realize in a way that is at once terribly humiliating and almost masochistically sweet that you are the one chasing after them. When they grant you with their reciprocity, with their attention — nothing feels better. But most times you are left sending a message that you immediately regret, because you know that it only puts one more tallymark in the “you need them, and not the other way around” column.

There are few things more painful than feeling like you’re constantly going out of your way for someone who is, at best, mildly amused by your affection. It’s hard to explain the feeling of disappointment exactly, but it’s mostly directed towards yourself. You can tell when you send them a good-morning text message, or mail them a gift, or take the time to do something for them that you know they’ll barely appreciate — this isn’t going to be reciprocated. This isn’t going to be really appreciated. Hell, it may not even be noticed. But you can’t stop yourself.

It’s just a sad, universal truth that there are people we love a lot who don’t really love us back. Whether platonic or romantic (or even, sadly enough, familial) there are always going to be these uneven relationships in which one person is constantly left feeling as though their emotions and their desires are a mild irritant. There are going to be friends we go out of our way for who never quite acknowledge us in return, who will never be there to listen to our problems, who will never drive out in the middle of the night to pick us up when we’re in trouble — no matter how much we do these things for them. And there are going to be lovers with whom we long to construct an entire relationship, but with whom we will always feel stuck at the frustrating “beginner phase” where no exchanges go beyond the superficial. It just happens.

The most difficult thing, it seems, is being able to admit when your love is going nowhere. Speaking personally, I have watched as more than one friendship proved themselves to be entirely one-sided, when my attempts to connect with the person (even in forums as non-committal as sending a Gchat), were proving increasingly pathetic. I was just way more into them than they were to me, and there is always a certain amount of pain in admitting that. You don’t want to confront this person and tell them, “Hey, look at all of these nice things I do and efforts I make for you, and you don’t do any of these things in return,” because it is a sad thing to do.

It’s sad because the truth is that they don’t owe you their friendship or their love. They don’t owe you the same kind of relationship you desire from them. You can’t insist, through repeated action, that someone is now indebted to you because you have proven that you are worth of something. We make the choice to keep giving our attention and love to someone who has clearly demonstrated that they don’t want it, and it is always their choice to make if they one day decide they want to start reciprocating.

But to break the cycle and force yourself to stop initiating contact, to stop making effort, and to stop caring about their response — that is much harder. That means admitting that you have lost a battle you didn’t even want to acknowledge you were fighting. But when we’re trying to get someone to love us back, it’s always a battle. And it’s one we’re almost always guaranteed to lose.

I'm not 100% on where to post it, but suggested this forum.

Randomly, I set up a date with this girl who had been a friend of mine for some time. We had never really had anything more than nodding to each other when we'd encounter one another, but one day we started randomly talking on that lovely social media site we all sell our souls to. After some time, I realized I found myself sort of interested in her. She, on the other hand, seemed absolutely uninterested in me. She would constantly call me ""bro"" (we don't hang in the same group of friends), and would constantly give me shit anytime I would try some sort of flirting with her.

Regardless, the conversations we had were enjoyable, and eventually I man'd up and invited her out to hang out with me to run some errands. It was a good time, and I felt as if there might be something a little more. From there, I told her she should come over and I'd make her dinner and we could watch a movie.

The dinner and movie went well, even if I was incredibly nervous (I'm not very good at dating). We decided to head out to a random bar to grab a drink, mostly because I was nervous I was miserably failing at the date. We arrive at the bar, and immediatly we regret the decision. There are TONS of birthdays going on at the bar, and they take up almost all of the seating. Being the proper gentleman, I seek out some seats and we sit behind a rather large birthday party.

We laugh, we sing along to the music, and enjoy our drinks. Out of nowhere, a drunk party-goer walks up to us and hands us two pieces of cake. We were a little leery at first, and just sort of stared at each other. Out of nowhere, she shoves the cake into my face, and I quickly retaliate. People around us are laughing hysterically, but we're just sitting there, staring at each other, with cake all over our faces. It all seemed so perfect, so I kissed her. She pulled away and cracked a smile, saying ""You just wanted more cake..""

I have never had a more amazing first kiss in my life. Covered in cake, and with the whole bar staring, we shared a completely perfect moment. It doesn't matter what happens with her, or where my life goes. I'm just happy to know I shared a completely perfect moment the other night, and I hope you hearing about it as much as I like telling that story.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_nbd6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/nbd6f/a_beautiful_moment/,

*The letter is the first letter of her first name. The number represents the numerical order of that letter---S1 could be Samantha, S2 could be Stephanie, and so on.*

*  D1----We were in first grade. There was something about you that made you different from the boys, but I didn't know what it was.
You didn't have cooties that's for sure. I remember saying ""the captain of the losing soccer team at recess has to kiss"" you. After winning the first month of school, suddenly we were losing. You knew I wasn't trying to win before I did. You taught me that girls are way smarter than boys.
*  J1----Our second grade class was rowdy preparing for the Christmas show. I suggested to the music teacher to make us sit boy-girl. You taught me that a face that pretty was worth the wrath of (some of) the other boys.
*  C1----I was in third grade and you were in fourth at the school dance. I couldn't take my eyes off you. You taught me that slow dancing was actually great, even though I had no idea what I was doing.
*  R1----After moving across the country, I had no idea how to flirt with a girl like you. Pissing you off was all I could think of. You taught me that sending a girl crying to the teacher wasn't going to get me any kisses.
*  J2----My family was suspicious when you called on a Saturday night. I was in fourth grade and too shy to admit a girl was calling. I pretended you were a wrong number. I spent two years trying to forget you at a different school. You taught me that girls do not forgive being ignored. 
*  J3----My first love, plain and simple. I spent two months interested in you and it finally worked. We were in all the same classes and you actually got my jokes. Then I got scared and pretended the whole thing was a joke gone too far. I was heartbroken when you turned me down at the sixth grade dance. I was still in love with you at the beginning of eighth grade. A couple months later, your best friend asked me out for you. I got scared again. My (then) best friend asked you out; he pitied you and dumped you the day after a group date where he ignored you. I asked you to the eighth grade dance and you didn't want to get hurt again. You agreed to one dance and we hung out in a big group. I kissed you on the cheek at the end of our song, and I knew in your eyes we both wanted more. Nothing happened for three years. Then in high school, we went out again. I finally got you alone in your driveway at 2am and then it happened. My first real kiss. Not an elementary school peck like before. I mean a *high school* kiss. It was everything I hoped it would be for the previous six years. You were an amazing kisser. We dated for awhile, but you said it was just too awkward. You taught me that being escaping the friend zone, albeit temporarily, was indeed possible.
*  T1----I had no interest in you, I admit. But it hurt to see you collect a $10 bill from the head cheerleader on a dare to ""kiss the biggest dork in the school"". You taught me that two women working together can be bitches.
*  A1----I had my (then) best friend ask you if you liked me because he was dating J3 above. I was looking for someone else, the whole school knew I wasn't over her, and I admit all I knew about you was that you were hot. My buddy was real vague about a secret admirer and I thought you'd never suspect that he was calling you about me. I was wrong. You taught me that women don't want to be the rebound girl.
*  G1----After the good Baptist girl of J3, you told me a bunch of dirty jokes and were really quite forward with your hands and your flirting. But you were the ninth grade slut, and I didn't want somebody like that. You taught me that nothing good comes easily; you were way too easy.
*  B1----You spent the last two and a half years of high school snickering at me with your friends because you thought you were out of my league. It occurred to me years later that I was out of your league because you stooped to that level. You taught me that 12 women working together can be sadistic bitches.
*  J4----J3's best friend. You were tall, blonde, and hot. I sent you something romantic (don't remember exactly what it was) with J3's assistance. Apparently I wasn't your type. You taught me that women are shallow sometimes too, and that's okay.
*  S1----Your constant innuendos playing billiards at my friend's house showed that maybe you were interested. You always said you wanted me to stick the blue ball in the center pocket as hard as I can. But you said that to every guy and repeatedly to me. You taught me to talk to girls to gauge their interest, instead of guessing from a distance.
*  S2----You yelled at my good buddy B for helping your friend avoid trouble by taking the fall himself. You taught me that standing you up for Homecoming was the best revenge.
*  A2----You taught me that big tits do not a great personality make.
*  N1----You taught me that I couldn't compete with a college guy that you weren't over yet.
*  K1----You taught me that I shouldn't listen to lesbian rumors. You said they weren't true after you landed a prom date.
*  M1----You were my first love interest at college. I wanted so bad to kiss those lips, but how could I compete with a future first round draft pick? The fact that he was banging half your teammates was either unknown to you or irrelevant. I heard about the divorce and massive child support. You taught me that women find rich guys irresistible more than I thought. 
*  K2----You taught me that a girl with a kooky religion is a dealbreaker.
*  C2----You taught me that a perfect ass and a 4.0 GPA were all that some women had to offer.
*  E1----You taught me that being way too religious of a nonkooky religion was a dealbreaker.
*  R2----I still have issues with you two Presidents later, but my main emotion towards you is pity. You were my first piece of ass. The bluest eyes I ever saw, a handful of tits, and a tight pussy with a perfect bush. I thought we were gonna get married. I thought you were the one. I thought I was in love. I was in lust, and I was just getting laid. Nothing more, nothing less. We were long distance, and I loved skipping class to fuck you for seven hours off and on when you came to visit. But I found out in a chat room from one of your exes that you two were still having booty calls and that I was terrible in bed. You didn't tell me I was doing anything wrong and I asked repeatedly. I should have known when you just laid there. Driving five hours to surprise you at your birthday party was a mistake seen as three of your former partners (and one current one other than me) were in attendance. You just stood there and didn't get excited and I left in tears. All that after telling me that you had had sex one time before we met and you were afraid a virgin like me would dump you. I don't care about your sexual history. I care about the lying and the cheating. But if you were so experienced, why were you so terrible in bed too? You were a dead fish, but I had no basis of comparison. Almost a year together and not one blowjob??? You taught me that women could also be cheaters.
*  A3----I admit we hooked up in a bar because I was lonely and depressed thanks to R2.  You taught me that oral sex (giving and receiving) is amazing.
*  S3----My AOL fuck buddy. A little chubby, but you had tits and ass to die for. You taught me that girls in trailers are incredible in bed.
*  C3----I moved out of state after graduation for a job, and I thought you were gonna be my new AOL fuck buddy. We had phone sex and you found out that I fucked R2 above, whom you went to high school with.  I never heard from you again. You taught me that it's a small world.
*  F1----You were a stripper in a major city with the Super Bowl a few miles away. You taught me that a clothed handjob in the VIP room was indeed possible for free, despite so many men for you to choose from. I had to peel off those boxers when I got home. You taught me that maybe I wasn't so bad looking.
*  J5----The best pair of lips so far. We met on a blind date and we fooled around in the parking lot of the restaurant. Our second date was you sneaking me into your dorm room, followed by a 30 minute blow job, 10 minutes of eating your pussy, and then I fucked you twice. Then you wanted to go dancing for our third date. You taught me that, for some women, a man who isn't into dancing is a dealbreaker. I decided that you weren't worth it if you were so petty.
*  D2----We worked together for about a year. You took the long way to your car past my cubicle every day, and neither one of us introduced ourselves. You changed companies and I asked for your number on your last day. You stood me up because your on and off boyfriend was in rehab. You taught me that a codependent girl was not my thing.
*  J6----You were the first black girl I fucked. I was the first white guy you fucked. Online dating rocks. You taught me that no woman should go her entire life without someone eating her pussy.
*  D3----More online dating. The best phone sex I ever had. I hated that laugh of yours, you sounded seven years old. You taught me that of all the bands to follow on tour back in your teen years, Kiss was a dealbreaker. I couldn't bring myself to meet you.
*  C4----Another online date. Jesus Christ, I couldn't get a word in over the phone. Until you were horny. You taught me that phone sex can make a man feel used too.
*  L1----Yet another online date. We talked every night for a month. I walked into Starbucks, you said ""Hi nice to meet you"" and kept walking. You sent me an email the next day that chemistry is more important than you thought. You taught me that I shouldn't waste so much time on one girl like that.
*  L2----We had some Chinese and a good movie or two. We started making out and I wanted those tits so bad. But I couldn't bring myself to take the next step. Is it really that big a deal that someone driving by 100 yards away might be able to see into my living room? You taught me that bossy chicks don't get fucked.
*  J7----I really liked you, but you failed to mention that you were off and on with a guy that had gotten you pregnant last week. You taught me that being a step dad was not for me.
*  J8----We had a few dates and some rather boring sex once. You were unwilling to even try oral (giving or receiving) even once. You taught me to never date a girl whose college diploma contains the word Christian.
*  L3----Online again. I drove 75 miles to spend the night with you on five consecutive Saturday nights. Your 14-year-old daughter gave me dirty looks as she headed out with her 22-year-old boyfriend to smoke pot at the Super 8.  You used to answer the door with that full length red dress wearing no underwear and it left nothing to my imagination. You were smoking hot and pretty good in bed for 21 years my senior. But your breath was too much to handle. You taught me that smoking was a dealbreaker.
*  A4----Online. You taught me that posting a photo of you 100 pounds ago is a dealbreaker.
*  Wife----A brilliant mind, a heart of gold, gorgeous green eyes, long brown hair, and a sense of humor that doesn't quit. Double D tits, an hourglass ass, and a pussy that's ready for action five nights a week. Even after all these years together, being with you is still addictive. You are the love of my life. You were able to tame a lonely horn-dog because you were worth it. I endured two decades of loneliness for you and I'd do it a thousand times again.  Yes, I got laid plenty but I was still lonely. Nobody captures my heart, gets my jokes, kisses my lips, deserves my hard work each day, and drains my balls at night better than you. Our boys and I love you so much. Sometimes I am at my worst, but I always offer you my best. You'll never find a man who deserves you, but I can sure as hell try to be that guy. I can't wait for the next 60 years. You taught me that dreams come true.

When someone is confiding, complaining, or venting they are rarely seeking your opinion or assistance. Most often, they need someone to sympathize with them and tell them that they are understood.

In general, I think a lot of men hear women's complaints (about life, work, etc) as problems that need solutions and the man will offer advice (""Why don't you just do this?"") or they offer to step in and do something about it.

Both responses can be viewed as a threat to the person's abilities to solve their own problems, and are often met with defensiveness or, ""You never listen to me."" However, people often just want to be heard; the talking *is* the remedy.

Here's the other side. ,68,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1b7tyj/i_32m_cheated_on_my_exso_28f_heres_the_other_side/,"First of all, I realize the amount of hate that I am going to get for this. And most of it is deserved. What I did was horribly wrong, I regret it, I'm embarrassed by it, and I wish what happened, happened differently. 

The reason why I'm posting this is because of the huge amount of ""Emotional cheating"" and physical cheating posts that are prevalent lately here and in /r/relationships. I'm posting this is a word of caution to the people asking and to the people that are in the middle of it. For both sides of the coin. Here's my story...

I was happily dating my SO (lets call her Amanda)for 2 and half years when I switched jobs and met another woman (lets call her Christine). I don’t want to go into the details of me and Amanda’s relationship before then because it’s not important to the point of my post. I met Christine innocently as a normal hello and a chat about movies. Christine also had a boyfriend although it was long distance. We hit it off pretty well and all of sudden our friendship turned into something more. We texted, a lot. We texted at night (both confessed night owls). We went out for drinks together. We shared a lot, secrets, feelings, confessions. The worse part about it is that we both thought it was just a strong friendship. Later we realized that we were lying to ourselves. 

Our SO’s were guarded with their feelings for us hanging out and talking a lot. Amanda talked to me about it after another long texting session, and she said she had been seeing it for a long time and never mentioned it until then. By the time she mentioned it was too late, Christine and I were already basically emotionally dating. Still, we guarded our feelings for each other because we were committed to our SO’s (another lie to ourselves). Yet, we knew deep inside that it was more than that we just couldn’t say it. Amanda was always guarded even after she met Christine when I volunteered to arrange a meeting. 

We continued this though, and Amanda being secretly jealous but never saying anything but secretly fuming. In hindsight she was really trusting towards me, something she should not have been. I was a fool to play with her trust. Amanda did freak out when she found out Christine was going to the same music festival as us. After that, I reconciled with Amanda and promised to cut the texting to a minimum. Christine was also having issues with her SO, and confessed to me so. 

Anyways, I left my job and on the last day, at my going away party, both me and Christine drinking heavily, we crashed at her place and one thing led to another. Afterwards Christine took it upon herself to break up with her boyfriend, knowing that sleeping with me was the wake up call for her to end it. Myself, I kept on thinking I could reconcile my feelings for Amanda while keeping my friendship with Christine (I know, ridiculous). But something happened and Amanda found out that something went on, and I confessed to her. Amanda still wanted to work on the relationship, but I was honest to myself and initiated the break up. I wasn’t attracted to Amanda anymore physically and emotionally, and I couldn’t be with her. 

Here’s the lesson for the people asking themselves if they are being cheated on, and the lesson for the people cheating on their SO’s (emotionally or not):
1)	I lied to myself a lot because I thought I was doing the logical thing. I should’ve been honest with my feelings from the start
2)	What I did to Amanda was horrible and she’s still hurt from it. I will always be the asshole and deservedly so. I should’ve broken up with her long before that happened. 
3)	If your gut is telling you something is wrong, then something is wrong. Amanda knew something was wrong from the start, she didn’t nip it at the bud. I, being the asshole, took advantage of that. 
4)	You’re not just friends. Friends don’t text each other late into the night. Friends don’t feel guilty seeing each other. I did for some reason, and I thought it was just the male-female dynamic.   
5)	Communicate, communicate, and communicate. Even stupid irrational thoughts, talk them out. I learned that the hardest
6)	Be honest with your feelings. Me and Christine lied a lot to ourselves for the feelings for each other. 

The point of my post is that I know I did something horrible and it shouldn’t have happened. I feel huge remorse to what I did to Amanda. Even though I think it was for the best (Me and Amanda were coasting and I wasn’t feeling invested in the relationship, even before Christine came along), I should’ve ended it like an adult instead of stopping to cheating. 

In the end, me and Christine started dating, and I feel like she is the one I wanted from the start. I love her a lot, but I’m still guarded from what I did to Amanda and what she did to her SO. At the same time, we know that and we are aware of those problems, we vow never to let that happen. I hope my post helps, and I hope that people see it in the light of advice rather than sympathy, I’m not asking for that. 

TL;DR If you think your SO is cheating on you, they probably are. Emotionally or not, take it from someone who did emotionally and physically cheat on someone.

1364512191.0,57,self.relationship_tips,1b7hnk,A guide to No Contact (NC),73,16,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1b7hnk/a_guide_to_no_contact_nc/,"This is a post I've been meaning to write for ages. Basically it's the composite of many replies I've made. It's here because I am a LazyGit ') and I tend to use copypastas for common issues. This is here to try and help people, but as it will get buried sooner or later, it's also here for me to link or copy/paste bits out of to people. As it's me the typing will be atrocious so I'll edit out the typos slowly, but here it is:

&gt;
&gt;**NC, whys and wherefores**
&gt;
&gt;NC is _No Contact_. It's a strategy for getting over a finished relationship. It's a very effective way to heal, but it it not easy. It's not a way to make someone jealous and miss you,it's not about the other person at all in many ways. It's about the quickest path to you being happy.
&gt;
&gt;- What situations does NC work for? Do I need NC?
&gt;
&gt;NC is intended to speed the healing process after a break. Its goal is to make you OK again, either to forget the other person forever, or to be over them enough to be their friend. NC works both ways, as it lets you (And them) heal and get past the emotional trauma. NC is needed when you are not over one another. This is almost always the case after a breakup. Some fool themselves into say, thinking their ex cheated so they are over it, but the emotional trauma remains. the rare cases when NC is not needed is when you have grown apart so much the feelings all left ages ago. Occasionally you have people that grew from partners into roommates, and in fact NC is not needed as all they need is a change fo titles to be friends, not of feelings. Also of course couples with children's can't do NC - they have a need to communicate (a reason to pick your baby mommas/daddies carefully). If this isn't you, if you have feelings about the breakup, then you probably need NC for some length of time. 
&gt;
&gt;- OK, so when do I use NC after the break?
&gt;
&gt;In many cases, not immediately. First you need to consider two things. Are you sure you both want it to be over? And even if you are, have you talked as much as is helpful following the break. The first issue is whetherit's a final break. If you broke up but you want to be together again, and the other person feels that too, then NC sucks. You need to discuss the idea of getting together again. getting back together is OK,it's harder than the first time round and takes work but it can and does succeed. However you _both_ need to want it and _both_ need to understand what went wrong and how you will work as a team to fix it (no one person giving a shopping list of changes the other must make and hoops to jump through, those rarely work). The key here is you _both_ want it. One is not enough. 
&gt;
&gt;Ok so you are either back together or worked out thats not working as one or both of you doesn't want it. WHat next? Next you may want to talk. Not examine everything, and once you split the other person doesn't 'owe' you this, but it can help. This _isn't_ about telling the other what a shit they were. It's not for revenge, it to understand so you can both learn. generally one of you will have more tolerance for the talk than the other, generally the ones dumped wants to talk more. But anyway, you talk until one of you has had enough, at which point you should stop. Pushing it beyond that is almost never constructive. 
&gt;
&gt;So now is when you start NC. It doesn't have to be sudden and unannounced, though it can be. If your ex beat you then you probably skipped past the thinking about getting together again, and your tolerance for talking was zero, thats OK. In these kind of cases you can just cut the other person off, but if your split was less acrimonious than that then it often helps to say thats whats happening. You can explain that to heal, and if you want this to be able to be friend later you need space to heal and move on, and thats easiest without any contact for an extended period. If the other person understands this they will hopefully see it as a positive, and it really is the best way to end up friends as well. 
&gt;
&gt;- I want to say a last thing/end a last letter!
&gt;
&gt;Ok, so in 99% of cases, this is a sucky idea. Most letters tend to involve phrases like 'home truths', 'what really happened', ' why you were really an asshole ally he time and now i realise it'. The problem is these don't help to send. If you feel the need to say this stuff the chances are they won't hear it. even if, say, you are worried about someones mental health, they won't hear it well from their ex, tell their family.friends instead. Other than this most letters/calls tend to be revenge. they are getting in a last hit, to make up for perceived slights. The problem is that any letter invites a response, and you _don't want to have a conversation_ . People always think they can write ""don't reply"" etc but it never works. ANy talking to be done should have been in the initial closure phase after you split, not a last ditch fire-and-forget slap. if you need to _write the letter_ thats OK, but don't send it. Instead, write it, then go out in the garden, make a little hole, put the letter in and burn it (be safe though folks! forest and house fires kill!). Watch the smoke waft away, take a deep break and let it out slowly,along with the anger, as much as you can. It's time to move on!
&gt;
&gt;- But I'm so angry!/I want to show them how wrong they were/how much better I am!!
&gt;
&gt;The problem is, most people angry after a breakup feel the need to 'win' the split. but there is no winning. You both lost already. It's over. This isn't' a brilliant tactical victory or the other person inflicting a punishing defect,it's a bloody fight to s standstill, where you both leave the field bloodied and bruised. The battle is over, you need to go do something else now, or the anger will begin to define you. And you, whoever you  are, are better than that! In fact if you keep fighting, you lose automatically! You make your life about the other person. If you are defining yourself by them, whether angry at them, showing them how hot you are, how much you are happier without them,it's still about _them_. They are still your emotional centre of gravity, you a re orbiting them but just truing to ignore the,. This does't help you move on! That part of your life is over, time to move on!
&gt;
&gt;- Right, so thats done, what do I _do_ for NC
&gt;
&gt;NC is misnamed, in fact it's more like NIF: No Information Flow. You need to cut, close and block all ways information flows between you. You need to make it so even if you think about the person for a while you aren't hearing what they had for breakfast, who they are interested in now, or even how sad they are about the split. In the modern world the technological ways are to delete their contact details from your phone, mail client etc. _Block_ on Facebook (not delete or ignore, block so you don't just not see them, but don't say see their comments to mutual friends), unfollow on twitter, if you are enough of a dinosaur to use MySpace un-add them or whatever those folks call it. If you have mutual friends ask them kindly to not talk about them for a while as you need to get over it. 
&gt;
&gt;Some things are tricky, say photos. I suggest if it's nude stuff, get rid of it. It's not healthy to keep. The rest, put in a big envelops, seal it up and put it in your closet. Later, when you are healed you will want those memories, but not for now. In terms fo electronic stuff, if you need compress the photos to making them harder to access, you will need _some_ self control here, but basically do what you need to make you not casually look at stuff. 
&gt;
&gt;As much as possible don't do things that mean you hear about them/run into them etc. It's going to fucking suck at first, it will feel like losing a limb, but it is the way it works best. Inevitably you will think about them lots at first, but by excising them from your life for a while you give you the best chance of getting over it quickly. Then… get on with life.
&gt;
&gt;- How do I move on?
&gt;
&gt;The best thing is to _not_ sit at home moping. That may be useful for a few days at first. Then depending on your age and beliefs, a moderate number fo drunken nights with friends can help (not not _too_ drunk, and no drunk dialling!). After that, you gotta move on. 
&gt;
&gt;Reddit standard advice: hit the gym, delete Facebook (lawyer up for divorce). But more than that, get out of the house .Spend more time with friends. Take up that hobby you always thought of before, whether it's mixed martial arts or knitting, whatever. Choose activities that make you meet new people. Not to find the next partner, but because new people are a great way to wash away the crap in your brain. They make you think afresh, communicate who you are, approach new issues in new ways etc etc. Got a life goal you never tried, now''s the time! Evening classes in Spanish, building a massive mentor and coke fountain, cooking the perfect omelette, whatever floats your boat, but _do something_. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;- How long do I do this for?
&gt;
&gt;Shitty answer, but it depends. There is a rule of thumb thrown around, had the length of the relationship, but thats not perfect. Lets say at a minimum it's measured in months, not weeks. It can be years in some cases. Sometimes it never ends, not because you are still angry and trying to do NC, but because you _moved on_ and don't really care any more. 
&gt;
&gt;If you want to consider wham to talk again or restart a friendship, one cheap and nasty question, how do you feel about them fucking someone else. Now I guess you'll never _like_ the idea, but at some stage you become,… kinda OK with it. It's not like your favourite thought, butit's not terrible, and it does't stir up deep and nasty stuff int he dimly lit corners of your soul. 
&gt;
&gt;Of course the sucker is that to talk again, you _both_ need to be there. As a result it's best to only be the one to reconnect if you are the one likely to feel the connection for longer. Say normally the ones that was ditched not the ditcher. The one cheated on not the cheater. It's not perfect but it's how it is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;- What if they contact me?
&gt;
&gt;Again, it depends. In general, you either should have told them about tNC or you never wanted to speak to them again for some reason. In these cases, unlessit's something genuinely urgent (like a legal issue) then just ignore them. Responses will lead to more communication. Just forget it and stick you _your process_, not theirs. 
&gt;
&gt;Ifit's persistent you can think carefully about who they would react to being told to stop. Think carefully as many of not most fo the people that will keep trying to contact you will take your response as an invitation not a rejection. However if you really think it will work (and be honest with yourself, ask a friend etc) then you can say ""Please don't contact me again."" But really no more than that, you _don't want to communicate anything more_. 
&gt;
&gt;- What now?
&gt;
&gt;So you've done this, you are on the path, well you just… continue. You go on with your life. Maybe you get inn contact later, and become friends or not, maybe you don't and find new loves, new laughs and lives. But you move on with a whole, healthy heart - or as much of one as us flawed individuals can have. but you are better than you were at the start, and you are ready for the next person, the next partner. 
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

This year we celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary, literally more in love than ever. AMA.",76,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/15qyxw/im_a_33_year_old_male_who_at_18_knocked_up_his/,"As the title states, I'm now 33 and my wife is 31. While having beaten incredible odds, we've done our fair share of fucking up. This will be mostly about myself, but having been with my wife for over 16 years now, my marriage and my family and my wife take up a significant portion of that story. So here goes.

I was born in San Diego, California, and even as a small child I knew I was lucky to be growing up in paradise. I visited my grandparents in Phoenix one summer and asked why people didn't go to the beach since it was so hot all the time. I felt sympathy when I was told there was no ocean there. I loved San Diego. This is important. 

I had a pretty normal elementary school situation, wasn't popular, wasn't not popular, I was smart, things went well but not exceptional. I did however make the notable decision at the age of 12 to skip going to my local junior high and instead get on a bus at 6:30am to get sent off across town to a much better school in a terrible neighborhood with a computers program. This is also important.

At any rate, when I was 15, during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I was informed that my family and I would be moving to Denver not long after the upcoming Christmas. This was not news that I welcomed. I'd had a few girlfriends by this point (five during my freshman year alone, so I had a pretty active social life), and was enjoying playing in my awful garage band. Because I was young and 6 months was a long time, I generally just played this up to my advantage to get free stuff from my male friends and attention from my female friends.

That is, until the week after Thanksgiving in 1994, when my parents flew to Denver to look for a house, and I stayed over with a friend and rode the bus with him to school (I'd chosen to attend far-away high school as well). 

Then my life changed forever, and I promise it's not in the way you think.

My friend introduced me to a girl that week who would eventually impact my life in some big ways. I won't give a ton of story for this part though because it's not super relevant except:

* We started dating with exactly 30 days to go before I moved away, which at 15 and at the height of one's pretention, seems very cinematic and tragic and lends the whole thing a very fated/Romeo and Juliet kind of thing, which wasn't the kind of emotional shit I really needed to handle at that moment in time.
* She was my first semi-sexual partner (I've never known how to classify this, she gave me oral and I fingered her but that was the extent of it. Not sure if that means I was a virgin after that or not.)
* She broke up with me the day after Valentines Day after I'd moved because she'd already kissed some other boy. We'd of course written awful poetry to each other, spoken about marriage, decided we were soul mates, had plans for children, what our jobs would be, where we'd live, etc. by this point and that's how our relationship ended, that time.
* We remained in this unhealthy non-friends, non-enemies, non-dating but on and off nonsense as periodically more than friends for a couple years, even while we both were relatively involved with other people. Unsurprisingly at this point, this is also important.

My move to Colorado was tough but ultimately I found many new friends (even if we were the weirdos who looked like Robert Smith and Morrissey), a new band, a new core group of people I still talk with to this day, and many girls, including the amazing one who'd become my wife. She was a friend of the girl I was dating at the time. She said something to someone about my girlfriend having a ""vaginal wrench"" on me, and that she'd vowed to have me by the end of the year. She had me within two weeks.

You see, since I was very little, girls were an obsession for me. I never had that ""girls are gross"" stage, I pretty much always wanted to be around them and as I got older I pretty much always wanted to be inside them. And the two I slept with by the time I was 17 obliged frequently and sometimes acrobatically. I often wish for my own 18-year old virility back, but I digress. Let it be made clear here that the two girls I'd slept with (as in PIV sexytimes) includes the girl who'd become my wife. While the girl she'd ""stolen"" me from and I fought constantly and had real issues with jealousy and clinginess (mostly on my part), I found that this new girl (call her K) and I didn't fight at all. We just didn't, and really still don't. We'd discuss any issues that came up an talk them through. Everything was great, we got along really, really well. Too well, in fact. Her mom had a hard time dealing with her divorce and was essentially a unipolar depressed person who did nothing but work at her job and watch TV. She wasn't the most attentive woman around, which was gold for a 17-year old boy and his hot 16-year old girlfriend who wants nothing more than to fuck. She had to convince me it was time to have sex, I was very cautious and didn't want to jump into things, but of course we did.

And being moronic teenagers who believe they are invincible, of course we got her pregnant.

Finding out about this was no picnic, as you can imagine. We were trying to find a place to eat, it was our 1 year anniversary which also tends to fall on homecoming (long story) and at dinner, she kept running to the bathroom to throw up, which has been turned out to be a clear sign that my wife is pregnant ever since.

I'd started art school by this point, but after much discussion and crying and explaining to our parents, we decided to have the baby. I went to school and worked a combined 15 hours a day some days, she worked at Target, and we lived together at her mothers house for about a year and a half. 

I eventually got a good job in my field that paid me a salary, we moved out into our own apartment, and we got married about 18 months after our son was born. We waited to get married, which I think was a really smart decision, because we didn't want to rush into a marriage and eventually feel obligated to each other in more ways than our son if a relationship between us didn't work out. It was a good move, I think, even if it did confuse my son when he was old enough to do the math between our number of years married and his age. (""Wait, but I'm 13. That means you've been married 13 years, right?"" ""Uh, no."")

We had a young and growing family, we had ups and downs financially, I lost jobs and insurance, the economy tanked, I supported us on freelance and unemployment. While I worked for one particular shitty company, we had our second child when our oldest was three despite the fact that my employer never paid my insurance premiums, unbeknownst to us, and so our baby's delivery and my wife's pre-natal care were not covered. This led to terrible debt issues, which led to us paying rent late regularly. We needed co-signers for car loans, we had our phones shut off routinely, and through it all, we loved each other, supported each other and in general made a happy life out of a hard one by loving each other and our children. When our son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 5, incurring a life-altering set of instructions for how to care for him to keep him alive, we didn't have health insurance for his hospitalization and incurred a $38,000 hospital bill, and despite it all, we rolled with those punches, too.

Having received her GED, my wife attended nursing aid school and went to work overnight at a hospital. Let me preface that I'm not blaming her being gone at night for what I'm going to tell you about what I did next,. but it explains how I had the time and what kind of environment I was in. 

You see, about when she went to work at the hospital, our marriage had devolved a bit, as the above paragraph might lead you to expect:

* Since we had been together since we were essentially children and hadn't had much time to mature independently, we were emotionally enmeshed and incredibly co-dependent, as a therapist would later point out.
* We just always had to deal with lots of money problems, which only got worse and worse and worse when my son went to the hospital.
* We developed trust issues, I was snooping through her email and she mine, and at this time I became inappropriately close friends with an ex girlfriend. The one from before, from California. The one I'd had unhealthy and bone-headed obsessions with for years and years. That one.
* We had two children under 5 who were incredibly spirited did not particularly get along
* We dealt with sleep deprivation, mood swings, depression, anxiety, passive aggressiveness, codependency.
* On top of all of this, we spent 5 nights a week apart. We still had sex quite frequently, but our intimacy was threadbare.

Pretty clearly here, I did some dumb shit. Like, really dumb shit. Shit that I would not be able to take if I had to live though it again. 

Shit that in a fucked up way saved my marriage.

See, I entered into an emotional affair with (surprise!) the previously mentioned ex girlfriend, the one from before my big move. The one I never got out of my life despite my friends hating her, despite my wife insisting this woman still had a thing for me, the woman I'd been convinced at one point I was going to marry had I not ""been trapped by my wife and kids into this life"". 

This woman was getting married soon, and had her doubts about that. We discussed our relationships in intimate detail which led to the inevitable ""we could treat each other so much better than our spouses are"". We didn't care what our spouses would have thought about it, we were only in it for ourselves and had tons of ways to justify what we were doing. We started sending insane amounts of text messages, we employed secret email accounts, all-day IMing while we were at work, all- night phone calls while my wife was at work... It was bad. 

The only way I can describe living with myself while behaving this way is: compartmentalization. I could alternatively turn on and off the self devoted to my wife and family and the self devoted to my affair. I could post all day about this and I bet it's where most of my questions come from. Some points from above that played into this behavior besides a complete lack of love for myself, respect for my wife, and mental clarity:

* I had a soft-spot in my heart for my hometown San Diego (still do) and she was a connection back to a time I saw as before my life fell apart. Before I'd been moved against my will, before I knocked someone up, before I would have needed to scrape snow off my car in the morning.
* The affair took place exactly 10 years after our initial whirlwind Christmastime fling in high school and somehow that made it seem just as poetic or justified or meant to be or something equally self-serving and disgusting. It was easy to slip back into that ill-fated, star-cross'd lovers mindset and step outside of everyday life.
* I had spent a lot of time missing that 16-year old I fell in love with and got pregnant while simultaneously resenting the 23-year old stressed out wife and mother she'd become. At my hands, admittedly, but that wasn't important to me at the time. I told you it was fucked up.
* I was not capable of communicating my needs to my wife because I didn't feel she was capable of hearing them, so I told my ex instead and she told me about her unmet needs and we decided to be each other's ""fun"" secret. When some issue got heated between us (she wanted to get presents for my kids, and I wouldn't let her, for instance), we'd cool it off by reminding ourselves that we were the ""fun ones"".

The sequence of events for Christmas 2004 was:

* Early Christmas morning - my wife leaves town to visit her sister on a pre-planned trip
* Christmas evening - I take my kids to Denny's for dinner and get incredibly depressed and thoughtful about  what I was about to do, and what would happen to my life because of it.
* Day after Christmas - I take my kids to my parents' house and drive directly to the airport, where I pick up the woman I had up until this point been having an emotional affair with.
* The next 24 hours - proceed to take this emotional affair into the physical realm.
* Evening of December 27 - send my mistress home
* New Year's Eve - pick up my wife from her trip

What you need to understand is: my wife is truly amazing. It's at this point in the story, where I really truly realized just how amazing. When she found out that the Christmas trip I'd sent her on to see her sister included my ex-girlfriend coming to town and spending 24 hours with me at a hotel downtown, she didn't throw me out. She was beyond angry, to be sure, but she didn't throw me out. She said she wasn't done with me yet. She came close to being done with me many, many times, but she never did. This can be attributed to about 12 million things, but mostly:

* Seriously, we really do love each other
* Lots of therapy
* Lots of therapy
* Appropriately-medicated mental health
* I worked my ass off to prove to her just how re-devoted I was to us. I wasn't great at first but I got the hang of it.

We worked on ourselves a lot over the next few years, and separated once for a total of 24 hours. She demanded I quit smoking to prove I had future plans with her and my children, and I did. Her mother moved in and helped manage the household while our marriage swept back and forth between stability and chaos. We cried a lot, we yelled a lot, we fucked a lot (we've always done that though). Once when things were back on a good track, I mentioned once how much I regretted doing what I'd done, and my wife said ""I don't, if you hadn't had an affair, we wouldn't have been forced to look at ourselves and fix things. Your affair saved our marriage."" And while I agree, I certainly can't say it's the best way to go about things.

And here we are. Our son is 14 and in high school himself. Our daughter is 11 and in middle school. We have a 4-year old who is incredible. My mother in law has moved out, I am finally at the very top of my career and field (remember that whole computer school thing?), my wife is a full-fledged nurse, one of the best at her work. She still works five nights a week but that isn't a problem in the slightest because of how we treat each other the rest of the time. We make well into the 6 figures and can provide things for our children and ourselves we never even dreamed of. I've been to New Zealand, New York, Iceland, Hungary, Ireland, Amsterdam and more for work and travel has always been something I love and without my wife's support and love I wouldn't have been able to accomplish half of what I have. I had to realize it's because of them that my life is great, not in spite of them. I'm not perfect but I'm working on being the best dad I can be and the best husband I can be and things are working out pretty well. To anyone who sees a bit of themselves in the chaos above, I'm proof that things can work out, even when you fuck up.

Anyway, there it is in abridged form, the full thing takes much longer to tell.

I love my friends but they don't listen to me, so maybe Reddit will. A lot of this sounds SO obvious, but for some strange reason, girls sometime forget. Some of this goes for guys too.*

Advice #1: Lower your expectations to 0. I'm **not** saying ""set them down to accept douche bags"". But ladies, stop demanding  out of every single guy you go out with to be the perfect Mr. Right you made up in your head. Contrary to popular belief, relationships are not like Disney or Nicholas Sparks movies. If you are single and looking for a partner, have *realistic* standards. If you already have a partner, and want him to do something nice, to take you on a romantic date, buy you flowers and whatnot *tell* him. Men don't read minds or hints - subtle or not.

Advice #2: Whenever he/she does something you don't like (yes, that includes the bedroom department) *tell him/her*. Be reasonable of course, but if it's something that you don't like, do it. I know you might be afraid that you'll cause conflict, or seem ""clingy"" but trust me, it's better than shoving all that anger in the back of the closet and out of no where *SNAP*. SO COMMUNICATE GODDAMMIT.

Advice #3: Do **not** control your partner. Let him/her go out with his/her friends, let him hang out with his female/male friends too (chill out on the jealousy too, if they wanted to be with someone else, *they would BE* with someone else. But they ain't, so trust them and sit the fuck down). Give him/her some space. Let him/her eat and wear what he/she wants, and do whatever he/she wants (as long as it's not harmful). He/she may love you but his/her life *does not orbit only around you*. Do not make *your needs* to come **always** first, and do not make your partner *responsible for your lifetime happiness*. That is a *big* responsibly, that I'm still not sure if you should put it entirely in someone else's hands.

Advice #4: Your pussy should not be put on a pedestal. Just because you have a nice ass, a good pair of tits and a vagina DOES NOT MEAN you get whatever you want from your boyfriend. He *does not* have to buy you things and pay for all your dates. He is your *partner* not another credit card you can go shopping with.

Advice #5: Relax. Be nice. Even after years of dating, don't take him/her for granted. Say please and thank you. Don't call each other bad names even if they deserve it. Tell him/her how much you appreciate him/her. Recognize and appreciate the little things he/she does to you or for you. When trouble in your relationship arises, use your brain not your terrified insecure little heart, overreact and lose your shit (easier said than done). Sit down and talk, don't yell. Take a fucking joke. Have a fucking sense of humor. Look more at what you *do have* rather than complaining and whining about what you *don't have*. And learn how to not give a fuck about what others think of you, your partner and your relationship. Want to go back to your ex? Do it. Want to go out dancing and grind on him all night long? Go ahead. Want to wear a short skirt on girls night out? Can't see why the fuck not. Prefer not to go out on Valentine's Day and instead rent movies and watch it in a fort in the middle of the living room? By ALL means. Irrelevant opinions from irrelevant people are also irrelevant in your life.

That's all I've got.

Love,

That single friend - who finally got out of the forever alone island and is in the happiest relationship of her life.

I am 45[m], and I have been in many relationships over the years.  All but one of them have failed for various reasons, but I feel that my experiences over the years, my intelligence, and an ability to empathize have left me with some ideas about what makes for a good relationship.  I'd like to share them with you.  Please feel free to criticize, praise, or otherwise add to the discussion about your own experiences and how they relate.

---

I have come to realize that there are 4 things that form the foundation of a good relationship:

* Communication
* Honesty
* Respect
* Trust

You may wonder why some things are not there.  Love, for example.  Shouldn't love be there?  Perhaps, but I don't include it for a couple of reasons.  First, my philosophy applies to *all* good relationships, not just romantic ones.  Do you have a good relationship with your boss?  Then you probably have all four qualities.  A bad one?  Then you are probably missing all four.

Second, if you *are* applying this to a romantic relationship, then these qualities are the building blocks of the more complex concept of Love.  Love is different for everyone, and is a more esoteric concept.  It really is outside the scope of this discussion.

Besides... I call this the relationship CHaRT, and ""Love"" didn't fit ;)

So... what do these things mean?  Perhaps something a little different for each person, but I will share with you my take on it.  As said before, feel free to disagree and discuss.

* **Communication**

Talk to each other.  Duh.  But it's more than that.  Don't just talk AT each other.  Communication is so much more... a touch of the hand on your partner's arm (not recommended with most bosses, by the way), a smile from across the room, *listening* to each other.  These are all facets of communication.  Give feedback, and positive reinforcement.  She's not going to be open to communication with you if you tell her ""that's a stupid idea.""

It's not a debate, either.  Don't have a goal of changing his mind.  Instead, listen to what he has to say, and see if there is a way to compromise that you can both agree on.  Be honest but polite and respectful (interesting how this ties in to the other concepts, eh?).

* **Honesty** 

This is very important, and it's the one that most directly builds the fourth concept of trust.  No, guys, I am not saying that you have to tell her that ""yes, that dress DOES make your butt look big!""  But if you want to have the sort of relationship that you envy in others, where they both seem to have their own little secrets that nobody else knows, then you truly have to be honest with each other.  Don't hide your smoking.  Don't lie about where you were when you come home late.  

So... guys.  She cooks dinner for you and asks you how it was, and you had trouble finishing it.  Do you tell her that you loved it?  That she's the worst cook you have ever known?  That she'll never measure up to your mother?  Sure, maybe these things are honest, but they are not respectful.  You have to follow all of the ""rules.""  More on that in a moment.  

Perhaps you could be honest in a nice way.  Tell her that you are so blessed to have a wife who wants to cook for you.  Perhaps next time she could use a little less salt?  Honesty is important, but don't kill her with it.  Which brings us to:

* **Respect**

Ok, you stayed out late with the girls.  He told you to have a good time, and boy, did you!  In fact, you're a little drunk, and it's an hour past when you said you'd be home.  At the very least, call him and let him know when you'll be home, and that you're ok.  He may not admit it in his manly way, but he's worried about you, and wants to know that you are safe.

Respect covers a lot of ground.  It's about boundaries.  Her things.  His feelings.  This person you are with has their own likes and dislikes, and many ""quirks.""  Treat your significant other with the respect and dignity that you would want them to give you.  It seems like such a given it's almost silly, but how many times have we teased each other about something benign, only to end up in a big fight?  If you know she's sensitive about the extra hair on her lip, then why would you make fun of her for it?  

Respect her feelings, and don't be a dick.  Even when you think it's all in fun -- she may not be receptive at the moment.  This ties in to communication: if you pay attention to your partner, you should know when it's okay to tease, and when it's not.

* **Trust**

If I'm going to use simile, then I'd say that these tenets are more like a 3-legged stool.  Good communication, honesty, and respect are all needed in order to build up trust in a relationship.  Break even one of these, and it's difficult to mend that trust.  Once a leg of a stool has been broken, would you sit on it again?  Of course not... you'd be afraid it would give out underneath you.

Do you trust your man to make a business trip to Vegas without seeing a stripper?  Do you care if he does?  If you're okay with it, why is that?  If not, why not?  It all comes down to trust.  And if he has been to a strip club before without your knowledge, then that trust was broken because he didn't respect you, didn't communicate with you, and lied.



If one of these tenets is broken, then most likely, they all are.  If you are having a problem in your relationship, then I can almost guarantee that one or all of these have been violated to some extent.

I have answered a few posts here on reddit, and many of my responses say the same thing: Talk to him/her!  Be honest!

Do you feel the same way?  Do you have a story that supports or detracts from these ideas?  Please share.  And thanks for reading.

Tell her immediately!,57,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/14yko5/you_develop_romantic_feelings_for_a_friend_tell/,"I wanted to write about it, because it happened to me recently and I wanted to share my experience in advisal form.

When you are being friendly with a person of the desired/opposite sex there is always the possibility that one of you starts to feel romantically or physically attracted to the other. If you are the one, have you thought about what to do? 

The friendship is also important to you and you don't want to destroy it by telling her that you like her more and make it all awkward. Maybe something in the lines of ""I'll wait, drop some hints, time will tell..."". But that's generally bad. For you. If you get more and more involved with your new feelings you will start to picture the ""upcoming"" relationship already and build a fantasy in your mind. In the meantime you will over-interpret every signal, every touching, every gentle laughter, every smile and use it to make up your dream-relationship. At some point you have made up such a perfect relationship that there's no going back for you. It has to be her. ""It's the way it's supposed to be"" you might think.

If you now tell her and she outright rejects you a la ""never gonna happen"", you will be totally crushed and it will probably end up costing you the friendship because you cannot stand being around her anymore (personal experience). If she does not reject you: Great! But you waited unnecessarily. 

**What you instead need to do is tell her right when you're sure something is changing about your feelings towards her.**

""She will probably say no"" is no reason not to tell her if you like her. Show some confidence. You have a right to feel that way and she should know.

It will take a lot of courage. In my case, I knew her only for five months but we hit it off really great from the moment we met. We were instant-buddies, hung out a lot, messaged a lot, talked about private stuff, etc. At some point we ended up sleeping in the same bed when I realized I might want more than friendship.

Don't you dare telling her over Facebook, texting or something like that. There is so much potential for misunderstanding which you don't need at all. Invite her to your place, to a cafe or something, anything that seems normal (not date-like). It is important that no one is sitting next to you of course so that you can talk openly. It especially crucial to make sure that no one you know might bump into you. If you are at a public place, wait until you got your coffes or whatever. Make sure you will not be disturbed. This conversation will be very important, if not the most important in your relationship.

Look her in the eyes and then tell her that you started to feel differently about her. She will recognize your honesty and that it took you a lot of courage to tell her. Girls appreciate both! Ask her how she feels about it. 

She has generally three possibilities: 1) Not gonna happen, 2) Not right now, 3) I might feel the same. 

- The important part is that regardless of her response you will not have to ride an emotional roller-coaster for the next days/weeks because you're not madlessly in love with her (yet). 
- If she rejects you, this might act as a fantasy-blocker and prevent you from falling in love with her.
- You just gave her a big compliment. Girls like compliments.
- Now that she knows she can behave accordingly and also try to not make it uncomfortable for you (by hugging you all the time, sitting on your lap and the like). With telling her you have doubled the number of persons who actively try to restore your friendship. If you don't, she will not work towards it and most likely make it extremely difficult for you.

Maybe tell her how you also value your current friendship and don't want to jeopardize it by ""wanting more from it"" if she cannot feel the same right now. Then talk about how you are going to handle the situation. She has to help you with that one, and will, if she values your friendship. Maybe the best is to keep a little distance for a while to help you cool off and refocus. 

TL;DR: Tell her immediately. There is no reason not to. It pays off in any case.

**1.** Confessing your love for eachother- it's really important that you wait for a while before you do this in a relationship. If you confess love for somebody before you even start a relationship with them, you can't explore where your love may take you during the actual relationship. She/he may not be the right person for you and it'll be a burden you don't want during a relationship.

**2.**- fantasy bonds- I read up on this a while ago, and it was the exact same situation I happened to be in. It's basically when you use something like texting/facebook messaging or a similar service to create a connection (or an even greater connection) before you can in real life. What this does is it puts an image in your head that you have something greater going on between you and who you're communicating with than you actually do. This can tie into confessing love as well, the words ""I love you"" can slip easily when you're flirting with some girl/guy over the phone.

**3.**- communicate- (just putting this in here :P) don't be afraid to talk to your partner. When you're with eachother and not speaking, she's thinking that because he's not talking he doesn't want to speak. He's waiting for her to talk so he can talk back. Don't do this, break the silence, think of something to talk about, and let it out!

**4.**- let things off of your chest- if you feel that there is something wrong, don't hold it in, you'll only feel worse and worse. You may start to develop harsh feelings toward your partner over nothing.

**5.**- girls do need their space- if you have the ability so spend every living second with your girl, great! Don't. After a while, she'll start to become less and less wanting of it. Think of it like that amazing but expensive meal that you like to get at your favorite restaurant that's just so good that you'd love to have it more often! But if you had it every night, it just wouldn't be the same after a while. But not in a way that you only see her once in a while, if she starts to seem less interested, take a day or two and give her some space to talk to friends or do her own thing.

**6.** guys make lots of sacrifice for their relationship- men tend to put off things, lose sleep, work harder, etc. for their women. It can really hurt a guy when they do all of that work just to see their girl who seems totally disinterested/occupied by others completely. Your man may seem like a stoic barbaric warrior, but a man who is commited to his relationship may have a ticking timebomb of a clusterfuck of emotions going on inside of him.

Background: I'm a 21M working towards my college degree, and for the past three years I've worked summers and breaks at a certain supermarket chain that everyone may or may not know to be the devil. For the past three years every time I had to go back to school, I would be placed on an educational leave, meaning that I kept my job but was not scheduled until the next time I was able to be home and work.

This week I was home from college for spring break, and working as usual. Today was my last day on the schedule before I went back to school, so I dropped by HR to fill out my leave forms for the rest of the semester when I was told that suddenly, ""corporate"" has decided not to give educational leave to college students any more, so if I was not able to at least work weekends then I would no longer have a job. I was not able to do this, so I was unceremoniously told I was terminated after clocking out today and would have to reapply for the summer if I wanted my job back.

I get home and make an angry post on facebook detailing the situation and before I know it, my father, who is halfway across the country on a business trip, has read it, made an angry post on the company's facebook page and called their global ethics hotline demanding an explanation for the policy. I haven't even been able to talk to him about it yet - he's working still and has done all of this from his phone.

My father and I butt heads sometimes, but in situations like this, it makes me so happy to know that I have somebody who will literally jump up and fight for my well-being at the drop of a hat, while being a thousand miles away, and having not even heard of my situation directly from me. I feel like I don't always show my father the appreciation he deserves, but tonight I'll definitely make sure to tell him how much I love him and how much it means to me that he's there for me. 

If you're reading this, you probably have someone in your life that will fight for your happiness, too. Don't take it for granted. Let this person know how much they mean to you.

(Repost from r/relationships)",54,11,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1c5v7q/dear_reddit_its_learning_to_love_the_person_you/,"This popped up on my news feed the other day and it turned out to be very real for me [25f] and my SO [21m]. We've been together for a year and a half. I HOPE you enjoy these wise words, Reddit.

&gt;ARE YOU WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER?

&gt;During a seminar, a woman asked,"" How do I know if I am with the right person?""

&gt;The author then noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so he said, ""It depends. Is that your partner?"" In all seriousness, she answered ""How do you know?"" Let me answer this question because the chances are good that it's weighing on your mind replied the author.

&gt;Here's the answer.

&gt;Every relationship has a cycle… In the beginning; you fall in love with your partner. You anticipate their calls, want their touch, and like their idiosyncrasies. Falling in love wasn't hard. In fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You didn't have to DO anything. That's why it's called ""falling"" in love.

&gt;People in love sometimes say, ""I was swept of my feet.""Picture the expression. It implies that you were just standing there; doing nothing, and then something happened TO YOU.

&gt;Falling in love is a passive and spontaneous experience. But after a few months or years of being together, the euphoria of love fades. It's a natural cycle of EVERY relationship.

&gt;Slowly but surely, phone calls become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome (when it happens), and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead of being cute, drive you nuts. The symptoms of this stage vary with every relationship; you will notice a dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and a much duller or even angry subsequent stage.

&gt;At this point, you and/or your partner might start asking, ""Am I with the right person?"" And as you reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had, you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when relationships breakdown.

&gt;The key to succeeding in a relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the person you found.

&gt;People blame their partners for their unhappiness and look outside for fulfillment. Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes and sizes.

&gt;Infidelity is the most common. But sometimes people turn to work, a hobby, friendship, excessive TV, or abusive substances. But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your relationship. It lies within it.

&gt;I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in love with someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better. But you'd be in the same situation a few years later.

&gt;Because (listen carefully to this):

&gt;***The key to succeeding in a Relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the Person you found.***

&gt;SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. You have to work on it day in and day out. It takes time, effort, and energy. And most importantly, it demands WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make it work. Make no mistake about it.

&gt;Love is NOT a mystery. There are specific things you can do (with or without your partner), Just as there are physical laws Of the universe (such as gravity), there are also laws for relationships. If you know how to apply these laws, the results are predictable.

&gt;Love is therefore a ""decision"". Not just a feeling.

- An expensive ring    
- Becoming debt-free
- Joining of debts
- Having an amazing job
- Making a ton of money
- Living together
- Owning a home
- Getting married in the immediate future
- Having a wedding date
- Having a wedding ceremony at all (don't let the anxiety or cost of a big event put you off, you can just go to City Hall).
- Removal of testicles
- Loss of all that is fun in life

What getting engaged DOES require: 

- The decisive and unambivalent promise that you will marry this person. 
- That this decision is based on the fact that your personalities and goals are compatible enough to ride the waves of what the future brings.  For some people, it takes them a week, for some it may take a year or two, to have enough knowledge to make this decision.
- To start living your life as if this other person will be a part of it as long as it continues.

It breaks my heart to read, day-in and day-out, the relationship advice requests of people who are getting ultimatums from their partner about getting engaged.  I am sad for the person who suddenly finds him or herself transformed from a comfortable (for him/her) relationship limbo, to a time of difficult decisions.   And that this person finds he/she needs to use what are, in my opinion, flimsy excuses to postpone these decisions.  I also have sympathy for the person who feels he/she has to make the ultimatum.  I can only imagine the humiliation involved in an attempt to force your SO to think of you as an adequate mate.  And then to have to wait for that person to say you are OK-enough or put conditions on that decision?  Just awful.

After all, the very reason I found myself in this subreddit in the first place was because I was having a very difficult time getting a certain boy out of my head. But reading about everyone else's heartaches has really helped to give me perspective, and you know the funny thing? The answer is always so obvious when someone ELSE is in a certain situation. I spent the last few hours reading stories from r/Relationships, r/BreakUps, etc, and each time, it was so OBVIOUS to me what that person should do. And yet when I get plopped into a situation of heartache myself, it's like a haze settles over my mental faculties, and what would have been so obvious, I am suddenly completely blind to.


But something clicked in me as I was reading countless stories by other redditors. At first my repeated thoughts were this:“If only they could let the past go, persevere, and keep going forward courageously and with their hearts open…then they will be able to find happiness. If only they would refuse to give up.” And then the twentieth time these words resounded in my mind I suddenly realized, Hey…this is something I can do.


Because you know what? Chances are, you’ll be more likely to have that relationship you crave so much, once you teach yourself to make happiness a habit. You know this is true. Yet you may ask, what if I teach myself to be habitually happy and still don’t find a relationship? 


Then so WHAT? You’re happy, aren’t you? And that’s what really matters. Why do you want a relationship in the first place? Because you think it’s going to make you happy. And personally, I don’t think you’ll have to worry about finding love once you’ve found happiness.


Happiness takes perseverance and bravery. Perseverance because heartache, sadness, or whatever distress you’re feeling doesn’t disappear over night. You have to actually make an effort, every time you remember the memories that hurt you, to let them go. And bravery because happiness means opening your heart and your arms to life and everything and anything it brings, even if some of those things are scary. If you avoid things in life because you are too scared of getting hurt, how can you ever be truly happy? To be happy, you must be fearless, and to be fearless, you must take action despite your fears and doubts on the matter.  


If your heart is aching right now for whatever reason, over whatever person, it boils down to this: Don’t let the unhappiness you are feeling now rule you. Don’t wallow in it. Do something about it. Do what needs to be done, and move forward. Heartache and sadness are addictive feelings, but like any other addiction, it’s a habit that can be kicked. So kick it in the balls, say “fuck you,” and go be happy.

We have gone through a lot in our relationship.    
We've gone through dealing with death of a loved one, major depression, problematic drug use, denial and other issues. We have problems with our family life, my family won't speak to me and his parents take their stress out on us. We've had to deal with him going to high school while I was at college. We had to adjust to living with each other at such a young age. We both work 2 jobs while going to school full time. We still have financial problems. We go through other relationship related issues and its not always easy.

But you know what?



We are getting through these things. We are happy together and in love. We support each other every day. He is the love of my life, and I am his. We still find time to go on dates, even if its a picnic at the park. Sometimes things get hard. We both deal with a lot of stress. But we have found what works and what doesn't in a relationship.

I have a list of things that I think are the most important thing in any relationship. I hope they help you(:

* Communicate with your partner. This is the most vital thing for any relationship. Also remember that effective communicating means talking openly to your partner and your partner truly listening.

*   Kiss your partner every day. A nice, meaningful kiss. Not just a peck.


*  Make sure your partner knows that you love and appreciate them. Its easy to resent someone who doesn't appreciate you.
 



*  Try to go out on dates and spend quality one on one time with your partner. 
 



*  When you argue or discuss things make sure to not use the words ""always"" or ""never"". Think about what you are trying to communicate to your partner before you speak. 
 



*  Again, when you argue or discuss things, try to not play the ""blame game"". Try to think about how you play a part in the issue as well. Maybe they don't do the laundry because when they do they want to hear a thank you from you. Almost every issue is a two way street.



*  Know when to walk away from an argument. There are two types of people in this world. People who are ""right"" and people who are in a happy relationship.
 

*  Love, care about and appreciate yourself. How can you possibly love someone fully if you cannot love yourself. 

 

*  Have sex with your partner. Be open about communicating about it. Sex will be so much better if you can be honest about what you like.

I hope these tips can help you as well. I truly think they have helped me have a lasting, loving relationship.

It's obvious that different things will work for different people but I am looking for universal examples or things that newlyweds might either take for granted or simply not have learned yet. 

I am looking for advice from people who cohabit or are married as I find these to be pretty much interchangeable. I will start with my own example. 

I am 30 years old and my husband just turned 29. We've been married 9 months, together 6 1/2 years and cohabiting for 3 1/2 years. One thing that has helped to keep our relationship fun is that we do not take ourselves too seriously and like to get silly every now and again. I think this keeps us young at heart, keeps the humor going and it alleviates some of the arguing since we can make each other laugh. Also, we do not allow hollywood/movies  to dictate what romance is. We define romance on our own terms in our relationship.

Porn is amazing it makes you feel good it's exciting it taps into our primal cave man and satisfies a desire that's somewhere at the very base or our hierarchy of needs.  It feels good.  Now with computers and smart phones we are conveniently connected to porn 24 hours a day within an arms reach.  It's a giant 80 ounce big gulp of porn we just suck on all day.  If we could watch ourselves it would look a little unhealthy.

Now I don't hate porn, I hate what it does to people.  Porn these days is sensational, it's over the top, it's producers and directors trying to get as much new material out of the same few holes and a dick or two.  Basically over time it's starting to get really weird.  So what I do hate is what porn does to your average regular nice guy (or girl) like you and me, who is innocently been sipping on that big of fat bucket of porn Slurpee for a little too long.  It makes us weird.

Essentially we get really ahead of ourselves.  Say I'm a college sophomore and I hit it off with sorority sue down the road, after I impress her with some shitty sushi restaurant and maybe a few shots of burnett's vodka we start getting down to business. Here's where the trouble starts, while we have literally spent less than 6 hours in each others presence, thanks to my porn Slurpee, in my mind I've essentially banged this girl 45 thousand times.  In your mind you've done all the freaky shit. So here's this poor girl who innocently enough was hoping you would make sweet love to her when instead after the third round of sex you're explaining bukake and where to tie what to where for the water melon dildo.

So how what I'm trying to say is getting too comfortable with porn, or expecting your SO to fulfil your porn star fantasies right of the bat is not going to go over very well.  Your porno Slurpee is creating a massive illusion of unattainable expectations.  So while you're begging for those picture messages of sharpies in the pooper your poor girlfriend is upset you didn't notice her new haircut.  

So what I'm saying is having such a porno-centric view of sex is very toxic in new relationships.  So stop it, you're being a jerk. unless of course you're both already into that and know what you're getting into in which case this whole post is a mute point. But I digress...

This leads me to my next point on how after porn I started having better sex.  Porn is like one big pedestal for sex.  Especially for those who aren't getting any.  It is worshiped as the ultimate; all means are justified as long as the end is sex.  It doesn't matter, had sex!  This is absolutely not true if you're in any sort of relationship where you're want any chance of having sex again.  So stop putting it on a pedestal.  Stop asking for it, stop with the innuendos and don't buy into it.  What happened with me was I took a step back I figured maybe tonight well just cuddle there's always sex tomorrow or the next day. So we did we just cuddled.  I didn't go for the reach around I didn't rub my boner all over her and I shut the fuck up about it.  I could tell she was confused.

This went on for a day or two and no shit I challenge anyone to try this and see if they don't get the same reaction.  Literally after a couple days of me playing down the sex she was literally begging for it.  In three days she went from being annoyed that I was pestering her for sex, to sexting me telling me she can't wait for it.  She is into it, I'm not trying to direct a porno staring us, she is straight jumping my bones like amazon jungle woman.

So finally when we do have sex I cut the shit and stopped trying to be my own porn star and even more important I stop trying to make her a porn star by telling her how to sit or lay or how her back should be arched whatever that is all for the camera angles anyway, get a mirror later on and have fun with it then but in the mean time let the sex be organic.  You're not going to be porn stars on your first scene, or even for the first year. So just focus on the two of you pleasuring each other.  Learn what she likes what she doesn't like how she likes it.  Be unrelentingly selfless in bed.  It's not a tit for tat and if you are a generous lover it pays dividends when you least expect it (awesome)


TL;DR

1335472427.0,37,self.relationship_tips,su4h5,Last night was good enough that I wanted to share a success story with you fine people.  ,42,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/su4h5/last_night_was_good_enough_that_i_wanted_to_share/,"Hello Reddit.  I(**31M**) am writing today about time spent communicating with my partner(**23F**) last night while she was taking a bath.  

**Background**:   Met at a party and became (healthily) inseparable.  We have been spending time together for about a year, and moved in together September of 2011.  At no time since then have I had any real doubts about the time we have been spending together.  We have several notably odd companion interests that are wonderful to engage in, conversation is generally a delight, we’re both hot for each other physically--and our histories growing up, while very different as events contrasted on timelines, share poignant similarities in other ways.    

**So**: frequency of sex had begun to slacken in the past couple of weeks.  As of last night it had been about eight days without direct intercourse, although intimate and incredible slippery handjobs have been flowing like water.  Other demonstrations of affection have been plentiful and I feel we are closer than ever.  I am quite smitten with this creature and wake up each morning surprised and delighted to have her next to me in bed, wondering what I did right to deserve to be in this situation.  I bike home from work enthused that on most days, she'll be there to greet me.  

While communicating previously, her disinterest in straight-up sex was attributed to feelings of bloat and internal discomfort.  Additionally, she often experiences pain the next day.  On top of these, she has a history of her sexual desire waxing and waning on a semi-unpredictable schedule.  

By contrast, I am a highly sexual creature who employs it in the service of stress reduction.  I am forever becoming aroused and love to engage in vigorous, playful, enthusiastically energetic fucking that leaves the sheets off the bed and the pets very confused.  

I want to be very clear: I believe her when she tells me she's not bored of me, I believe her when she tells me that it's not me.  In spite of that, feelings began to bubble up sporadically:

""*Do I not excite her as much as I used to?*""
""*She bought me a sex swing for my birthday and we haven't even used it yet.*”
“*Does this mean something?*”

This brings us to **last night**:  She was taking a bath and I was hanging out in the bathroom, feeling some of these emotions but not expressing them as I had already done so previously and didn’t think it would be helpful; potentially even annoying.  I realized at that moment that it was better for me to communicate and seek clarification than try to quash my feelings for the sake of the appearance of normalcy.  If I’m anxious internally (a rare state) it’s likely because something is unresolved, or because I don’t understand a situation well enough to feel comfortable.  
I slumped down on the somewhat dirty, somewhat wet bathroom floor and we checked in with each other.  About sex, about each other, and about some stuff that I didn’t even realize had been bothering me until I decided to open the floodgates.  Instead of nourishing the anxious and paranoid thoughts I laid them out bare in front of us and, while uncomfortable at first, worked through issues with loving and direct communication.  Oh, and we had some really nifty sex.  Suffice it to say, I felt worlds different—better—and wanted to share a success story* with you folks.  

TL;DR: Don’t forget to check in with the people you love, or you might wind up checking out. 

Oh, yeah – my partner is an active Redditor so she’s bound to see this.  I love you, sweetheart.

More than once. The moment you are in love seems an eternity, a drug of sorts. I suppose it is, given ""scumbag brain"" an' all. 

Every fucking time I fell in love was a masterpiece. A masterpiece of my hormones proving how human I am. The hard truth I offer is the fact that love comes and goes, ebbs and flows and all that good shit. The one thing that doesn't come and go is time. Every day is another you will never recover. Enjoy the time you spend with someone, enjoy the moment and know it may be fleeting.

 I tried my damndest to tell myself the same at your age but fell hard anyway. The hard falls are needed from time to time but so is a little wake up call. Your life is YOURS. You can share all the space and time you want with another individual but you will never recover the time spent if you choose to regret it. So spend it wisely. BE SELFISH, to some degree at least. Your BF isn't ""into"" you anymore? Why are you wasting 6 months wondering why? your GF is spending more time with another guy lately? Learn to let go. Seriously. 

I know that in the moment it can be hard to let go but one day you will have to. In my own experience, the best ones come AND go.

One partner gets horny. They get to pick either 'when' something will happen (now, 15 minutes, 6pm tonight) or 'what' will happen (sex, oral). The other partner picks whatever the previous one didn't pick. Or the non-horny partner can pick first. 

Obviously this isn't going to work just right for every couple, but it's nice when one of you is tired or just ate an entire large pizza or has work to do and the other is feeling the need for some sexual healing. It's also great when you're stuck in a complacency rut of ""We see each other every day. I'm tired. We'll just have sex tomorrow."" Ideally, the 'when' only includes times THAT day.

Then my buddy calls me up. I actually have not seen in several months; he has fallen into the pattern of starting a new relationship, and having no time for any one else. Such is life. Every one does it. The conversation starts like this.

 ""Man, I'm in a real funk right now. I don't know what's going on with my girl.""

 ""OK, tell Big Daddy all about it.""

 ""Don't ever call yourself that again. Anyways, I'm not sure what's going on. We hung out together, had a great 4th. We spent the day with her family. They love me. They keep talking about how they'll see me again.""

 ""OK, where's the bad part?""

 ""I don't know! We stayed up late, and had some drinks. Then I went home, and woke up with a hangover. Today I feel awful.""

 ""That sounds pretty reasonable. So far none of this has any thing to do with her.""

 ""Maybe not. I just know that I texted her her today, and she hasn't responded as quickly as she normally would.""

 ""OK, you are worried that she is distancing herself from you now? That is the most roundabout complaint that I have ever heard in my life.""

 ""You're not helping.""

 Once we had that out of the way we could finally talk about actual solutions. I have no idea why any one ever asks me for relationship advice, because I clearly make fun of my friends before actually being helpful. Since he asked though, and since I thought that it was interesting stuff, here it is.

 There is a lot of uncertainty, and awkwardness associated with a new phase of every relationship. Whether you just started going out, just moved in together, or just got married, every thing feels familiar, and unfamiliar at the same time. You know this person, but will they learn some thing new about you? Will it be a deal breaker? WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?! The good news is that there is no guess work to it. There is never any reason to worry about the timing being off, having said the wrong thing, or any of that jazz.

 Occasionally you will meet the person, who wants some one based on what traits they have. Basically if you are in the right place at the right time with the right qualities, then you are in. Unless you choose a partner like you choose an apartment, this person is not for you. Any missteps, or failures in their eyes are actually an opportunity to get out of a poor relationship where we are more concerned with being whom we should be than being whom we are. With the right person you are physically unable to screw it up. They value you for who you are, and not who you can be for them. Friend, lover, whatever form the relationship takes, the quality of the interaction is more important to them than its type. We have heard it a million times, but to thine own self be true. Said another way, just keep being your self, and you will eventually be surrounded by people, who love you.

 After I was done with my advice, I took a moment to really drink in how deep I am. I told him that I planned to write a post about it.

 ""Don't use my name.""

 ""No, it's not about you, you egocentric punk. It's about how awesome my advice is. I promise not to tag you in it, but you have early permission to like the post.""

 ""I won't.""

1338393109.0,36,self.relationship_tips,uc85c,The Advice My Momma Gave Me About Relationships...Part 1.,45,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/uc85c/the_advice_my_momma_gave_me_about/,"*I was asked by another redditor to post this here because they couldn't read it on my FB page because they didn't have a FB account. So I hope that this helps.*


I have always wondered why people came to me for love advice when I was always the friend that was single. I have come to a conclusion that it's because I always think logically and analyze situations. I don't mind giving the advice. My advice is usually what you already know that you don't want to hear, but need to confirm it anyway. Well I am no longer single and in love. I am glad that I listened to my momma's advice, cause Momma Maria is very wise.

This is Momma Maria's advice on relationships:

1. **FIRST LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF AND BE HAPPY BY YOURSELF!!!** No one can love you more than you can! You don't have to love yourself to the point were you're vain about it. But if you don't love or appreciate yourself, then who else would or can love you??? Plus I have learned that if you don't love yourself first, then you look for love to fill that 'hole' and that 'hole' is not filled with the right kind of love. Leaving you feel stuck and unhappy.  (I'll write more about this in a seperate note too.)

2. **WAIT.** I know that is harder than it sounds, but it is soooo worth the wait (trust me). When you are not looking, that person will find you or you'll find them. It will happen so stop looking for what you THINK will be the perfect man/woman for you. Cause more than likely what you think is right for you is not. Remember NO one is perfect and you will love the person, flaws and all. Also don't get discouraged while waiting. Do your own thing and have fun with your friends and family. Do things that you've never done or go places you've never visited before. Also as you're doing your own thing and trying these new things it opens the doors to meeting new people and learning more about yourself and the things that you like. So just try it!!!

3. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON, YOU'LL KNOW.** I know that this sounds like a load of crap or that it only happens in movies, but it's the truth. You will know when you meet the right person. It's kind of hard to explain, cause it's more of a feeling inside and it's different for every person ( that's what I believe). (I'll write more about this in a separate note.)

4. **NEVER SETTLE!!!** I know that being single can be lonely and scary sometimes, I've been there. But NEVER settle. If you feel that there maybe someone else out there, your 'gut' instinct is most probably right and you should listen to it. Life is too short to be unhappy!!! (I'll write more about this in a separate note too.)

5. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE.** By this I mean when you meet that person, it will come naturally and you'll feel at ease. You won't have to feel like you're trying to make the person like you (which happens in most relationships). You will be able to be your complete self around the person and they will love you more for it, instead of trying to 'win' them over.

6. **YOU WILL FEEL HAPPY WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON.** If you have taken the advice and found the right person for you, you will feel happy almost all of the time. Life is a bumpy road, but with the right person the bad times won't feel so bad and the good times will feel amazing! I know that sounds like something you've heard before, but it is the truth.

7. **COMPROMISE!!!** Now I'm not saying compromise on settling for someone or being a 'push-over'. I mean if situations come up that you and your love don't agree on, compromise! If someone is not willing to see your point of view and you're not willing to see the other persons point of view to come up with an agreement, then my friend it's not real love. ""It's my way or the highway"" attitude is not compromisable, don't settle for someone who is like that. You will end up hurt and miserable in the end (I personally have been there). If the person truly loves you and vice versa, then both of you will be willing to compromise and see where the other person is coming from to come up with an agreement. Compromising is also part of listening to your partner and understanding them. You both will be much happier in the end.

8. **DATE.** Yes I know this sounds kind of stupid. But you really don't know what kind of partner you want unless you date all the wrong ones first. Keep your mind open when you date and keep your options open. Don't always date the same 'type', because you might be surprised by the things you learn about yourself and what you like in a partner if you date someone you normally don't/won't. Also if you're dating the same 'type' of person, then obviously you need to change it up cause you haven't found the right partner yet.

Ok this is all I can think of at the moment. I hope that you or someone you know takes this advice. I love to see people happy!!!",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_uc85c,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/uc85c/the_advice_my_momma_gave_me_about/,

1365396377.0,34,self.relationship_tips,1bwe63,How to Break up with Someone,45,11,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1bwe63/how_to_break_up_with_someone/,"Ending a relationship is one of the most difficult things we can do. You're going to hurt someone you care about. Many, including myself, would rather be on the receiving end. But for whatever reason, if you know in your heart that the relationship is not going to work out, terminating it is the responsible thing to do. The sooner the better. 

There is no “right” way to do this. But there is a healthy, responsible way to end a relationship and an unhealthy irresponsible way. I believe if you hit these key points, you are terminating in a healthy, responsible way.

1. Do it in person.

Listen: You’re the one who will have to carry how you ended it. Not them. All breakups are difficult, but you want to leave with the least residue as possible. You want to like yourself afterwards and not have any regrets, including how you ended things. 

So, unless you’re in a long distance situation and there’s no way to do it in person, all breakups should be done in person. You owe it to them but also yourself. Email, text, phone, and even Skype are not acceptable. Don’t be a coward. They don’t deserve that. 

It doesn’t matter if you’ve been dating this person for three weeks or three years, sit down and do it face-to-face. This is someone you care about, remember? 

If you allow yourself to terminate a relationship via text, phone, or email, then most likely you will do it again. Stop yourself from forming this habit. Flip it and ask yourself how you'd like it if someone ended things with you this way? 

The only exception to this rule is if the other person is unstable and explosive and breaking up in person could be dangerous. 

2. Be honest.

Don’t open the “you deserve someone better” door. That’s bullshit. You entered through the front door. Leave that way. That means use “I” statements. Take responsibility by owning your feelings. Tell them how you feel and why you are ending this. This isn’t about blaming, which will just turn it into an argument. You're past that. You want out. So tell them. And that’s how you start: I have made a decision to end this relationship. It has to be that cut-and-dry. There’s no candy coating it. 

The more you soften, the harder the blow. They want you to be completely honest. They deserve that. I understand it’s hard for you. But don’t make this about you. Being completely honest is the cleanest break you can give someone. If it helps, write it as a letter then read it in person. For many, fear kicks in and they can’t say the words.

3. One you've made the decision, it should happen soon after.
 
Timing is something I struggle with. You probably don’t want to break up with someone on her birthday, your guys’ anniversary, Christmas, you get my drift... But don’t use timing as a excuse to postpone. I think once you’ve made the decision and you’re sure about it, it should happen relatively quick. Of ourse, terminating a marriage involves a lot more than ending a three-week dating deal. If you’re honest with yourself, you will know when you're letting yourself drag.

4. Don’t dissect the relationship.

A breakup isn’t about why things didn’t work. If you open that can, you're giving someone a false sense of hope. You're saying you may want to work on this. Many people do this because they think it’s justification. You should give them an explanation but you don’t need to justify it. Assuming the feeling isn’t mutual, they'll try to investigate why you want this. 

You do have an obligation to say why but after that, stay on your decision. Don’t get into the relationship. If you can be convinced, then this conversation is premature. Focus on executing the termination, knowing that ultimately it will be the least painful way to do this, even if it doesn’t feel that way in the moment. If your doctor has to re-break your wrist after you’ve just broken it to set it back into place, how fast and focused do you want him to be? That’s the mindset. 

5. Don’t let it linger.

You can’t break up with someone then ask them if they want to hang out as friends that weekend. Again, you are giving them hope. If you end it, end it. This means detach. Completely. Unfriend or unfollow on all social media. If they continue to follow you, that’s on them. Give them space by distancing yourself. Many feel bad so they want to be there for them during this transition. 

Don’t. That's emotionally torturing them. They may not have the strength to push you away, so you have to do it for them. Not only for them but also for you.

6. Don’t take pictures down and change your Facebook status to ""single"" within the week.

Do I really need to expand or explain? Remember: the way you handle the breakup says a lot about who you are. Give it some time. Let it be a transition. Just because you have the “talk” doesn’t mean you’re suddenly free to go crazy. Respect the relationship. The key is to be firm enough with your decision but also sensitive to the other party. Be strong but considerate.

Please take everything here with a grain of salt.

I met my wife through one of my closest friends. His family was celebrating his father's birthday, but my friend wanted to invite a bunch of people so he wouldn't be bored. At this time, his father and I had grown pretty close; to the point that I considered him just as close a friend as any other. His father looked at him and said that he can invite whoever he wants, so long as I would actually come out. So my friend calls me and says I have to come to this party, or no one else is aloud to show. I agree, and my friend continues to invite everyone else. I get there, and find out that my friend's dad is doing all the cooking, and its *his* birthday. I'm not exactly okay with that, so I offer to help. My friend's sister wonders who that is helping out with everything, and a little light bulb pops up over my friend's head. We get to talking and decide we'll go on a date. Moral of the story is, be yourself and love will eventually find you.

Now for the advice portion.
The first thing we did on our very first date was talk about our preferences, who we are. We talked about music preferences, favorite tv shows, hobbies, etc. I told her that I was at a point in my dating life that I was tired of BSing my way into relationships, and I'm going to be flat out with her. I explained about my anger issues, my sexual preferences, that I was a virgin, anything negative about me that I could think of. She did the same, and we quickly realize this is going to work. We got between 6 months to a year of the early dating phase out of the way, and skipped right to the serious part because we both knew what we wanted. If you do this at the start of a relationship, you can avoid a lot of heartache because both parties already know what to expect when the SHTF.

One thing we do is, when we get into an argument, we don't keep pushing to resolve the issue right away. Sometimes it is better to just let the other person cool down, and get back to the issue when we are more cool-headed. When anger and frustration get in the way, you can't get anything done. Don't simply push it down though. Burying your issues, no matter how simple, is *never* healthy. Hang on to the emotions you were feeling, but don't let them get in the way. There's a medium in there somewhere, you just have to find it, *then* get back to the issue.

If you're having issues with being a good romantic, there's a few things you can do to help yourself. Spend some time apart from each other. Don't actively think about your SO, let your subconscious bring them up. When this happens, remind yourself why you love them. Call them, text them, email them, whatever, just get a message to them that you couldn't help but think about them, and that you love them. When you're not preoccupied, and you find yourself thinking about your SO, think about what might make them happy. Don't think about that so simply though. Sometimes what you can do is create a small surprise that you would like to do for them, and it can turn out to be something they like as well. The best kind of surprise is one that both people enjoy; you have to enjoy creating the surprise or else it won't have the effect you want.

Talk about sex, as much as your private lives will allow you. Talk about ideas, things you both do and do not like. Sex isn't what TV and movies make it out to be for most people. You don't always have the most amazing sex the first time, or even every time for that matter. Don't let the fact that one of you didn't enjoy that particular session bother you. Sex won't always be perfect, no matter how hard you work at it, your bodies might not always be in sync. Make mental notes during sex about what the other person is doing so you can bring it up later. Explore each other's fantasies, don't let them weird you out, they're called fantasies for a reason. Don't break off a relationship just because you can't fulfill a fantasy, many of us never have the pleasure of doing so, but live with a healthy relationship.

When your SO hurts your feelings, tell them. Sit them down when they're in a good mood, and tell them why it hurts. Tell them why it hurts, and what they might be able to do to avoid hurting you again like that. On the other side of that: listen! Listen to your partner, put yourself in their shoes. You're doomed to failure if you can't get yourself to understand the way your SO feels about something, especially when it comes to the way you treat them.

To all the kids reading this, wondering if they're high school/college age relationship will work out in the end. Don't listen to anyone when they give you the default ""You're too young to worry about relationships."" There's no such thing, and I'll give you an example why I say that with such confidence. My mother-in-law had been dating her husband since they were juniors in high school. Her husband died about 3 years ago, and they were *very* happily married up until that moment. It does happen, just not as often as one would like to think. Don't let your age be the reason you make a decision about your relationship, love knows no boundaries, and can find a home in the hearts of those who least expect it. Don't mistake this for changes happening in your life, these are factors you have to weigh in to a relationship. Your life may not always be accommodating to the current relationship you're in, and sometimes you have to base your decisions around that fact.

Most of all, be open-minded. This sounds less than what I really mean. You might think at first, that the person you're looking at is too good/not good enough for you, but that is a mistake that is all too easy to make. So many people in this world get stereotyped by their friends, they're taste in music, they're hobbies, and none of that really applies to who they are. You might be considered a ""prep"" with your abercrombie shirts, and your pre-worn jeans, but that doesn't mean you don't go to metal concerts, and love getting beat up in mosh pits. Don't ever look at someone and think you've gotten to know them from that far away, go up to them and start chatting. You would be surprised that the person with the tattoos and piercings actually turn out to be intellectually, and very romantic.

If you are both going to the same function as a couple, don't bring everyone around you into your problems. Snide remarks, put downs, eye-rolls, etc. have no place outside of your own home while you are alone. Honestly, you ought to consider not doing any of these things ever, but if you must act out, keep it private. 

A friend of mine is constantly fighting with her boyfriend. He won't have sex with her, but she keeps turning him down and emasculating him in front of their friends. I wouldn't want to have sex with her, either. I was having some relationship issues recently, which I confided to her. ""But,"" she said ""You call him 'darling', and 'my love'... things can't actually be that bad...""

I responded to this by reminding her that he is my love. I call him these things all the time. Why stop when things are bad? Should I say ""Yes, shithead who said he'd do the fucking dishes three days ago..."" when he asks me for a favor? Should I do that in front of his friends? Sometimes pretending everything is okay when in public is the first step to resolving your problems. When you carry a chip on your shoulder to social events, neither of you are going to have fun. You will feel smothered. You will resent each other further. It also causes extreme awkwardness for the people around you. Your friends don't want to hang out with ""the arguing couple"". 

I used to bring my problems with me everywhere I went. I never got a break. Once my husband and I agreed to disagree for the sake of having a good time, we were reminded of WHY we were together in the first place. If you are always wallowing in what is wrong, you forget what is right. 

So if you are in a fight over something petty, or even something seemingly big, and you haven't had the time yet to work through it, just fake it. Don't be the bickering couple. Don't get wasted and decide to ""work it out"" in the middle of Scrabble night with your neighbors. If there is an immediate issue on hand, say one is drinking too much and is getting a bit belligerent, take that person into a private space to let them know. Don't say ""Ugh, there John goes again, drinking too much whiskey. Just put down the bottle, John, every one is sick of you yelling about nothing!"" 

I can't tell you how many times my coupled friends have decided to act out like this in front of me. They think it is normal. They think it is ""just what people do."" No, I have to tell you, you will be much happier keeping your issues private. That doesn't mean you can't confide in a friend, just don't do it in front of ALL of your friends while your SO is there.

I'm typing this for two reasons:
* to structure my thoughts
* to help others

I've spent the last 4 years in an on/off-relationship with a girl, who we'll name Kate. Kate and I got together because we were both seeking serious affection/comfort; I recently had my heart crushed by another girl, was doubting myself and everything and she was being too promiscuous and felt lonely.

Kate's main drive in life is a family: she'll do everything to have children and find a great father for them. My main drive in life is creative expression: I am a maker, it makes me feel alive. I never gave children much thought until I met Kate.

She's also very, very dominant. She immediately forms an opinion about something, and then she moves on. I, on the other hand, am a thinker who enjoys debating. We often had intense discussions about nothing significant, because we are so different.

This lead to me being frustrated and breaking up with her, only to get back together a few months later. This was in part due to her overwhelming desire for security, and in part because I missed the affection she gave me.

Now I realize how we got along: she gave me a sense of direction and strength. All I had to do was follow her and tag along, and she would do the rest. This was very easy for me, but that's not who I am. Even so, I kept on doing it, because I got so accustomed to her presence that I couldn't imagine not living with her.

She, on the other hand, tried to 'groom' me into the perfect father figure, as well as keep me tied to her. She made me feel guilty for not being there for her, or for spending too much time on my own. I never saw it like this until recently, and I'm sure she's unaware of her doing it. She just goes forward, and needs her man to be there for her.

Throughout the years I repeatedly asked her why she's with ME, but I never got a really good answer. Now, upon reflection, I realized that she doesn't care how her man is, as long as he is there for her and her children.

That's not love. When you love someone, you accept them the way they are, good and bad aspects. This realization, along with the fact that I kept on feeling more and more insecure the more I stayed with her, made me see everything clearly.

Her overwhelming desire for security and family made her choose any man who fit the criteria, or any man who could be molded into the perfect father for her children. Although biologically understandable, this is NOT a healthy basis for a relationship and I know many men (including myself) who wouldn't feel comfortable being subjected to this. 

Remember who you are, and live your life accordingly. Don't let anyone change you into something you don't want to be, and don't let anyone make you feel guilty for something you want. Accept people the way they are, and work with their personalities instead of trying to shape them.

We'd be moving into a 1BR Apartment in Manhattan. It's a decent size, but not very big by normal suburban standards. I wouldn't have my own room or anything and we'd have to co-exist a whole lot.

We haven't been together for a very long time. By the time we could potentially move in together it would have been about 5-6 months together. We've both been through about 6 other relationships and kind of feel like we have a better handle on what we want in a partner, hence the faster speed.

Hello to all! I wanted to share a little tidbit that made a huge difference in my relationships. (this is my very first post, so please have some mercy..!)

It came from a rather unlikely source, namely the classic book ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" (I am not big on self-help books, so it came as a surprise to me!). I read it some years ago and in there the author (John Gray)  describes one small difference between male and female understanding: When a woman starts to talk about what is bothering her, she basically goes into a stream of consciousness of stimuli, reactions, feelings, associated thoughts etc etc with the main goal to feel *understood* (and, quite often, it is this brainstorming session that gives them the clarity or even answer they needed). Men, on the other hand, tend to function in a more practical manner, so they mostly answer with a concrete piece of advice or solution, since this is their way to offer compassion and love. 

And here it's where it gets tricky: this is quite often interpreted by women as not understanding or, even worse, as downright ignoring their needs and feelings. The men, in turn, have no idea what happened, since in their eyes, they did the most loving thing they could possibly do. Obviously, miscommunication ensues (I only have to think at all the rage comics that depict such cases. major fuuuu there). However, when it comes down to it: both sides have said and done the same thing, however each in his/her own way.

So this is the theory, obviously broadly generalized, since each person has its own characteristics, needs etc etc - of course it is so. However when I read it, I was like ""Damn..It's true..I do tend to go into long-winded monologs about my feelings and I mostly do that in order to be understood or even for me to understand what I feel...And I also hate it when I hear dry pieces of advice when I have JUST OPENED MY HEART AND SOUL HERE, GOD DAMN IT, HUG ME NOW!!!"". 

So I set out to test the theory. I took the responsibility to limit my long winded monologs either to my girlfriends (which function the same way, so no problem there) OR if I really wanted to share (or impose...it's all a matter of perspective, right?!!) a huge ass monolog on my dearest and loved SO, then I should at the very least make sure I come to a concrete conclusion what it is that I want and just tell it like it is, in concrete sentences. ""I want to just talk about it and I would like for you to listen to me."" ""I need a hug"" - whatever is the core of my problem or need at the specific moment. In short, to ""translate"" it in a manner that he understands. And instead of going off on him when he does something that I don't like, I could just say what it is that I didn't like and what I would like instead. And interestingly, since he has a very clear view of what I need, he simply does it in a manner that is good for both.

Result: fights diminished to an astonishing degree, communication much clearer and much deeper. Emotional needs met, both satisfied and no prisoners taken!:) This has also been proven over time (must be around 10 years that I read and implemented it).



tl;dr men and women tend to have different ""language"". Meeting each other halfway: girls, take a deep breath and verbalize exactly what it is that you want. Guys: hug us and listen to us once in a while:)

Awhile back my girl and I were getting ready for a vacation and she wanted to get spruced up. So, instead of blowing her off and telling her to have fun, I went with her to the nail salon (not a spa, this is important).

I got a pedicure and she got the works.

Here's the point. 

She took about an hour to get everything done and I got to sit in a massage chair, have someone soak and rub my feet and trim my nails. We spent a great afternoon together and she even paid for it. I bought lunch (fair trade in my book).

I got to just sit there (make sure you go at a time when the salon is not busy), talk to my girl and spend some quality time with her while getting a cheap massage. This can be done anytime, not just before a trip.

1) She sees you as someone who is interested in her beauty regimen and not some mouth-breathing troglodyte. (I helped her pick out her color.)

2) You get to spend time with her and just talk.

3) She gets all beautiful and feels great about herself.

4) You get a back massage! (I went through the massage cycle three times!)

5) She will want to go out because that's what women want to do (at least mine does) when they get spruced up.

6) You might even get laid. (No guarantee here.)

Make sure you go to a small salon and not a big spa. Somewhere where they won't kick you out of the chair while you wait.

While it wasn't our best date ever it turned out to be a really fun time.

You know what blows big time?

The other night I was sitting with my family, most of whom are very successfully married. We were going in a circle giving our best marriage advice to my little sister on the eve of her wedding. It’s somewhat of a family tradition.

But that’s not what blows. What really blows is that I realized I don’t have any good marriage advice to give. After all, I’ve never had a successful marriage out of the two marriages I did have.

And so, when it was my turn, I just made a joke about divorce and how you should always remember why you loved your spouse when you first met her so that when times get tough you can find someone new that is just like she was.

There were a couple courtesy giggles, but overall my humor wasn’t welcome in such a beautifully building ring of profundity.

They finished round one, and for some reason started into another round. And that’s when I realized. Hey. I don’t have marriage advice to give, but I have plenty of “keep your marriage from ending” advice (two equivocally different things), and that might be almost as good.

It eventually came to me again, and what I said would have been such great advice if I were a tenth as good at saying things as I was at writing them.

And so, that night, I sat down and wrote out my “advice list” for my little sister. You know… things I wish I would have known or done differently so that I didn’t end up divorced (twice). After writing it, I thought maybe I’d share it with all of you, too.

I call it my “Ways I Blew My Marriage” list. Also, for the list’s sake, I am just going to refer to “her” instead of “them” even though they almost all were true in both marriages.

You people depress the shit out of me. I haven't had any luck in the love department the last few years. But in all fairness, I really stopped giving it a lot of effort last year when I went back to school because I'm just really busy and I don't feel I have the time and attention to give to a relationship right now.

My problem is that I love relationships. I was in one for 8.5 years that ended a couple of years ago and before that I had quite a few good girlfriends. I'm fucking addicted to that feeling. So since I don't have time for one now (and I never really meet women anyways), I became addicted to this subreddit. For some reason it satisfies that craving for all of the ups and downs relationships have.

Lately, though, it's been depressing me. I never seem to see good stories anymore. Everything is about FB stalking, women falling out of love with men (and visa-versa), cheating, people using one another, unappreciative partners, and fights with family.

So I was thinking, why not an uplifting thread for once? Anyone want to share some stories of good relationships or things that worked out? Maybe post some tips or something your SO did or does for you that is awesome? We hear so much about the bad parts of relationships, why not throw out some good things about relationships?

I'll start - My ex (I'll call her M) used to throw me the most awesome birthday parties. We used to have a big group of 15-20 people when I first met M, but as time went on and we moved into our mid-twenties, we never got together near as much. M used to make sure that everyone that was available showed up for my birthday. She would even call my parents to find out the names and numbers of old friends from high school and she'd always have some surprise guest I hadn't seen in years. In addition, she was an excellent cook, and the spread of food was ridiculous at these parties, not to mention the alcohol. She'd work on that party for weeks. Even after M broke up with me, she threw the biggest party ever for my 30th birthday. There must have been 40-50 friends from the last 2 decades of my life there. It was great. I doubt I'll ever have a birthday party that good again. Even though we were through and it had been a few months, I don't think I've ever felt as loved as I did that night.

Open an online dating account immediately (I used eharmony, it's pricey and tedious but worth it. The free sites were difficult to navigate and full of spammers.) Use clear sharp, flattering photos that display your confidence joy and good character.


2.    View and make initial contact with people you find attractive. (spend 1/2-1hour each evening weeding through.) Also make sure you use updated photos. If you show up to a date and you used junior year college photos but your 35 now, Don't be surprised if your date is disappointed/pissed.


3.    Don't be aggressive and weird in your contact with potentials. Be honest. Be funny. Type or speak in complete, coherent sentences. If it escalates to a date quickly then great.


4.    Set up COFFEE DATES ONLY for initial in person contact (or tea if thats what your into.) This is way faster, way easier, way cheaper. You will know within 5-10 minutes whether you want to spend another second with that person. No one gets dinner without a first coffee. Dinner is the second maybe third date. If the coffee date is awful you can bail in 30 min. and go home to watch gossip girl on netflix.


5.    Do the coffee dates on thursday or friday evening so you still have one free weekend night.
6.    Groom yourself and pick out a classy/appropriate outfit well before your date. All necessary body-scaping and cleaning should be performed. Look good. Smell good. Feel good.


7.    Approach each date with an open heart and mind. There is not just one soul mate out there for you, there are many MANY compatible partners that you may enjoy being around/becoming friends with/ becoming a lover with. Just take your time and find one that you click with.


8.    Don't be afraid of rejection AND Don't be afraid to reject someone or say ""no thanks, I'm not interested."" If you do need to say no thanks, do it as quickly and politely as possible: ""hey your awesome, but I'm just not feeling a connection."" Don't string someone along because you are too chicken to be honest.


9.    Don't be afraid to date multiple people at once. As long as your honest and don't immediately declare exclusivity with someone (you shouldn't) you reserve the right to ""play the field."" By dating multiple people I don't mean being sexually active with multiple people. If you do go that route you're rolling the dice on STD's. And lord knows you don't want to go out like willy lump lump.


10.    Once you find that great guy or gal and declare you exclusivity, fall in like, then fall in love with them, enjoy them. Go on cool dates. Be romantic, listen to your partner. Enjoy the experience, ride the wave where it takes you, be it a week, several months or a lifetime. You will crash and burn a few times, but its all about the experience.


11.    Don't forget to keep a balance too, don't neglect your personal time and space. And don't ditch all your friends for your new guy or gal. Loyal trustworthy friends need time too. Now get up off the couch and DO THIS!!!

1319409929.0,27,self.relationship_tips,lmgco,Some things I've learned from a relationship that unfortunately did not pan out.,33,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/lmgco/some_things_ive_learned_from_a_relationship_that/,"The following are things I've learned from a relationship that ended recently.  Obviously this isn't a complete list, but it's what I've learned (from others and myself) and hope to share with you all.  Please take these seriously if you value your relationship and love your SO.


- Listen.  Listen to your partner, hear what they have to say.  Never dismiss their worries.  It might be them fearing a problem in the relationship.
- Give them reasonable space, otherwise you'll come off as overbearing.  This puts stress on the relationship and makes you both unhappy.
- Don't give up everything else in your life for them.  Make room for them, but keep hobbies and friends.  Otherwise that person will become your life and you'll leech off of theirs.
- Simple one, but be sure to kiss and tell your SO that you love them daily.  Even if you're fighting, let them know you still care.
- Never let pride or arrogance get in the way of your relationship.  Those traits are never worth potentially losing the one you care about.
- Be there for them and help out in anyway possible.  Hate cleaning?  Well screw that, help them regardless.
- Never pay more attention to something other than your SO.  This gives the impression that they're not worth your time or that you're bored of them.  Be sure to really think about what you do day to day.  Be sure that they know they're loved.
- **Write** down a list, on paper, of what makes them special to you.  Why is it that you're with that person and what could you not live without?  Keep that list with you always and continue to add to it.  Use it as a reminder for your future self, because your future self can become quite blinded.
- Take a step back when arguing with your SO.  Why are you upset?  Did you have a bad day?  Did *they* have a bad day?  Find the root and don't let yourself be consumed.  Your pride will never leave you, they might.
- Never make big decisions about your relationship without first sleeping on the idea.  This holds true for anything in life.  You don't want to say something terrible which you'll never be allowed to take back.
- Therapists and friends are there to help you.  They give you an outside perspective.  Use them!  Use them as often and as frequent as you need.  They keep a relationship together.  Never be afraid to tell someone a problem you think is going on.
- Change, adapt, morph yourself for them.  This is especially true for first relationships.  When two people come together, give and take will occur.  Allow yourself (within reason) to change for the one you love.  If you don't then that just shows selfishness.
- If you started doing something at the beginning of the relationship for your SO, don't stop.  This will make the other feel worth less and make them think you don't care any longer.
- Always give presents to them and always take them out to nice restaurants.  Show them you love them, make it known how you feel about them.
- If there is something, **anything**, that is a problem in your relationship, FIX IT.  Don't patch it, don't pretend it doesn't exist, and don't try to have the other person change to solve that issue.  You need to fix this ASAP before it spreads and becomes more than one issue.  Therapists are again a great resource to help.

And always think to yourself ""Is what I'm going through right now worth losing the other person over?""  You'll hopefully make a lot less rash decisions / mistakes if you keep that in your head.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_lmgco,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/lmgco/some_things_ive_learned_from_a_relationship_that/,

We’re entering phase two of our new flair system and we’re so excited to tell you about the new changes we’re making. 

By popular demand, we’re moving away from having individual subreddits for various relationship-related issues, and we’re merging all our subreddits together. We are going to incorporate the satellite subs into /r/relationships with our new, amazing tag system. We’re hoping this will alleviate some of the tension over people being asked to move their posts into smaller subreddits. 

Instead of posting to /r/relationship_tips, you will be staying in /r/relationships with your post tagged for 'Miscellaneous'. Users can use the filtering function, [seen here]( http://i.imgur.com/1VJWaSJ.png), to decide what posts they want to read. 
__________________________________________
**Subreddits that we’re rolling into /r/relationships**

* /r/Breakups
* /r/Dating_advice
* /r/Relationship_tips
* /r/IHaveIssues

**Subreddits remaining separate**

* /r/Settlethis

/r/Settlethis is remaining separate because it is our brand new project and we want it to have some space to breathe and grow on its own. This subreddit is a place for couples to come, make their own posts regarding a relationship issue or disagreement, and link to one another’s content. Then users can weigh in to help that couple sort out their disagreement and arbitrate the discussion. Because that’s such an odd format for reddit, we wanted to give this new project its own space. 
____________________________________________________________________
Please be patient with us. 

This is new for us too and we’re working hard to iron out the kinks in the system. That being said, we don’t pretend like this will be flawless. Give us some leeway while we make these changes. 

Special thanks to /u/ashishtiwari who has been our CSS guru helping us get this up and running.

I just got back from a New Year's party and had a five hour long conversation with women and men about dating and relationships. I'll try not to make this long, but basically I sat and listened to women speak about how they can't trust their men and that's something you deal with as a woman today, in 2013. Men were on the other side discussing how they shouldn't have to have their woman go through their phone if they trusted them, regardless of whether they're cheating or not, etc. Needless to say it was frustrating to hear such, IMO, idiocy.

Am I the only one in the world who still believes in honesty? I'm speaking all of this from a man's point of view, but I just want to know I'm not alone out there.

I believe in meeting a woman (who is completely single), going out on dates, getting to know her and then eventually seeing if things can progress further into a relationship. I DO NOT believe in dating other women at the same time. If I am dating other women, I TELL the new woman that I'm dating around and not exclusive with one person, thus allowing her to make the decision for herself to see if she wants to pursue anything with me, knowing I have other options. But I've never had more than one woman at a time. I do not believe in cheating, in flirting, in keeping in touch with exes, or trying to explain how a girl I've already previously been involved with is ""just a friend"" and was never anything more. I believe in honesty and communication and being open.

I want a relationship where my woman can answer my phone if I'm not in the room and have her fully know that nothing scandalous will be on it, if she ever did decide to snoop. I want a relationship where my woman who can hold my phone all day or all week. I want a relationship where she can have all my passwords and know every intimate detail of my life. I want to be completely, 100% open in my life.

I tried explaining this at the party and they all said I'm living in a fantasy world and will be single forever if I think that way. I just want to know whether I'm crazy and need to lower my expectations in life or that there are in fact others like me. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR Am I the only one who believes in no cheating, no lying, no flirting, not dating multiple people at once, not having anything to hide from your SO, etc. Everyone said I'm living in a fantasy world and that I will never find someone who feels how I feel.

Edit To Get This Approved: Last relationship I had was for a year, she was [F24] I was [M25] and it ended because of my expectations in this matter that she did not reciprocate. I've been out of a relationship for almost 9 months.

1353339587.0,24,self.relationship_tips,13gc96,"23F &amp; 30M met on Craigslist, have you ever met anyone on the ""casual encounters"" section?",25,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/13gc96/23f_30m_met_on_craigslist_have_you_ever_met/,"We are a couple that met on the ""casual encounters"" section of Craigslist. Here is how from both points of view.

From the MANS side 30M:

Ok, I met my current girlfriend of three year on Craig’s list casual encounters. For those of you not familiar with this part of Craig’s list—it’s mostly full of bots and girls seeking money in exchange for “favors.” My girlfriend falls in the last category. She was seeking finical help to get away from her husband (now ex-husband).

The reason why I was on the site—I was looking for a random hookup. I soon found out that over 95% of the postings are bots, and the other 5% are looking for money. I obviously didn’t want to pay for anything. I was really naive in thinking I was going to randomly hookup with some girl. Thinking back I was extremely arrogant thinking just by replying to an ad and sending my picture I would get some hot girl to want to hookup with me. But never the less, I kept at it because one of my friends who is a girl and who is a semi closet bi-sexual would both post and reply to ads. She would have random hookups with other girls. I thought I could have the same success.

I still remember my girlfriend’s ad. “Looking for a SD” there was also a picture of girl with a really gorgeous body attached. I had no idea what a “SD” was, honestly. I sent her a very quick email response because most of the “w4m” ads get deleted very quickly from Craig’s list. “Tell me what you think” and I included a picture of myself. She replied with “HOT.” Nervous, skeptical, and a little confused I respond with, “What are you looking for?” She answers, “I think it’s obvious since I put “Looking for a Sugar Daddy” in the title.” I was a little mad but still curious. I asked her how much she needed and she told me, I think she said $150. I asked her to send me another picture to prove that was her in the ad. She did and we exchanged phone numbers and setup a day and time for our first date. I canceled the first date because I was WAY too nervous, but rescheduled. At the time, I thought it was a mistake rescheduling, but now I am glad I didn’t.

My first date with my current GF was the first and only time I have ever met anyone from Craig’s list for anything. Because of the sketchy nature of the whole thing, we met at a coffee shop. I got there like an hour early to scope it out. I get a table and get a text from her about 30 mins before we were to meet saying that she was 30 mins ahead of schedule. I told her I was already inside. I saw her walk past the front door and she was gorgeous, and still is. She sits down and we talk for at least 3 hours. By far the best first date experience I have ever had. We have a lot of similar interest, but enough differences to keep us interested in each another. After the 3 hours were up we had previously agreed to go to hotel, which we did. If I didn’t feel like we so connected, I would have just left, but I really liked this girl. We had sex in the hotel room and it was typical first time sex with a girl you liked really-- awkward but yet really good. I gave her the money. We STILL feel really bad about it. We only exchanged money one more time on our second date. After that we both agreed that we would just date after that. A month later she moved in with a friend and a month after that she moved in with me. We are still together today.


From the GIRLS side 23F:

 When I met the love of my life, I was 20 years old and trying to escape a bad relationship. When I say ""bad"" I dont mean we argued or anything frivolous like that. My exhusband (who I married at 18) was very physically abusive, to the point the police were called several times by his own family. I had no family of my own, no one to protect me, and nowhere to go...so I stayed with him for a year after the abuse started. This is how I met the man Im lucky enough to call mine today.

I had a friend who worked in the ""entertainment"" industry that said I should look for a ""sugardaddy""...she said very sweet, wealthy, older men came into her club all the time, and several of the other girls were taken care of financially by these men. She said to place an ad on craigslist. I was terrified...I had only been with 2 men in my entire life, the idea of having relations with someone I didnt know for money was degrading. But with an impending death threat the following week from my drug crazed husband, I placed the ad. It was sickening the things I was emailed, and I cried and cried, but felt like I had no other choice...I had no job and was in college, having the s**t beat out of me daily was wearing on me. There was one reply that wasnt disgusting and the guy looked normal, his email was just a picture and the words, ""Tell me what you think."" I didnt know what to say, my friend said no matter what you should make a man feel like hes the sexiest man alive, so I just replied something like, ""Hot"". He asked what I was looking for, and having already been talked to by tons of disgusting men, I was NOT going to say something sexually explicit to this man, so I said, ""Well isnt that obvious?"" or something along those lines. I didnt reply to anyone else.

The first time I was to meet up with this man, he cancelled. We rescheduled and met at a starbucks. I remember everything about the first day I saw him. His hair, his shirt, how red he got when I walked through the door. We talked for hours, and I was sad that this man would never see me as anything more than a girl he paid for sex. We went through with our arrangement, and I cried all the way home. We met one more time when money was exchanged, and after that he asked me on a real date. He knew my backstory, he had paid me for sex twice, I couldnt believe someone so successful and smart and wonderful actually wanted a relationship with me.

We dated secretly for 3 months while I tried to escape the hell I was living in at home. I would come to him with bruises that covered my entire back sometimes, and it was always so horrible to leave this wonderful man and go back to someone who was so awful to me. In the fall, a friend helped me leave and moved me to a completely different state so my husband couldnt track me down, and then once it was safe, I moved back to be with the man I love today. That was almost 4 years ago. I cant imagine a day without this man, he is incredible. My life is so different because of him...I was able to become independent, finish college, and have a great job that I love. I am happy, and I thought that was something I would never have. I thought I wouldnt make it to my 21st birthday back then...I thought I would just be another missing person in the backwoods of the southern state Im from...
Someday I will marry this man I love, my savior, my best friend, and I know I will always be safe with him.

Just a note, anyone who is going through a domestic violence situation...I want you to know there is a way out, there are shelters and people who will help you. You deserve better...http://www.ncadv.org/ can help.

It's so sad to see how decent human beings are treated; like trash.

I've seen so many posts about cheating, my girlfriends best friend cheated on her ex boyfriend...look it sucks but there are so many things you can do to avoid the heart ache and pain. 

The order of the points:

* 1) For people being treated like crap or cheated on.
* 2) For people with no trust in their relationship.
* 3) For people thinking of cheating.
* 4) For cheaters. **(WARNING: RANT)**

Here is my general advice to all you redditors:

* If you've been in a relationship for a long period of time, do not let that cloud your judgement! I've seen way too many post saying: ""I've been with him/her for X years, we are married, we have children."" I understand your situation is tough, but there is no excuse for cheating, none! You, who is in this situation right now, get up and leave. They've mistreated you enough times that really it breaks my heart to see you get stepped on, and I don't even know you. If my girlfriend did such a thing (And she knows what I am like when it comes to cheating and the such), we'd be done; instantly. I'm sure she would say the samething. This does not mean you do not love the person, and I'm sure the minute you walk out that door you'll regret it and you love the person on the other end. Don't look back, keep moving forward and I promise you'll find a better life beyond their front yard. That person is sweet poison, and it will kill you eventually.

* If you are in a relationship without trust, get out. Simple. There is no other way of putting this. Without trust your relationship is done for. Trust is so hard to build back and it almost never fits back the way it once was.... I'm sorry.

* For those thinking of cheating; don't. It's sad but the truth is, you are no longer in love with that person in the other room. He/she still thinks you are head-over-heels for them and they feel that way for you. Please stop taking them along for your emotional and physical affairs. It's so sad to see good people get taken advantage of. I don't care is he/she put on 50 lbs. It's called communication, I know it is difficult and cheating is the easy way out...but at least promise me you will dump them gently say you weren't ready for such a serious relationship and go no contact. And never put the blame on them, this is your fault, 100%, putting the blame on them and bringing them down is completely uncalled for.

* And finally for those cheating...I really can't say anything to you. You really need to pick up your act. If you know you're in a position that can cause you to cheat, take a step back and think about that person worried sick and waiting up for you. Think about how you have hurt your last partner, think about how you can no longer be friends with them the way you once were because of your actions. When you do have thoughts of cheating, please don't. I know it's in the moment and that person in front of you is so attractive; Call your SO, tell them what has been on your mind and break up with them.

They will try and get you back, and it isn't worth all the stress you two will find in continuing the relationship that never was meant to be. **WARNING RANT** I find that you are the scum of the earth.

Some hindsight advice.,31,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/17r9hg/before_you_decide_to_stay_committed_in_a/,"Without pouring too much ink about myself, here’s a little background information to put things in context. Me 28F and him 29M. I met my SO over four years ago in a random and unexpected place. We began dating shortly after our first encounter. For various circumstantial reasons, I moved in to his apartment both quickly and pre-maturely. We both have two post-secondary degrees each and we both aim for excellence in whatever endeavor we take on. We’re compatible in a variety of ways, but I’m not sure that’s really relevant for the purpose of this post.

Early on in our relationship, I discovered that my SO was still continuing to have communication with an older woman on OK Cupid. Warning flag. My instincts told me to cut my losses while our involvement wasn’t too entrenched or deep. But his reaction and willingness to repent made me look past this “incident”.

Over time, my instincts kept burning inside me. Something didn’t feel right. So I changed the settings of his MSN messenger. Not one day after, I find hugely incriminating conversations that he maintained with an acquaintance he made at the hospital during one of his rotations. The conversations were both erotic and sentimental. I called the girl in question immediately and demanded to know all the details. She refused to tell me if they had sex. Being selfish and reckless, he would use her to get “ego boosts”. Wow, what integrity.

Fast forward in time, and we’re still together (we went to counseling, his family became involved, he became more trustworthy and my instincts were finally cooled down). Right before we move cities for a career, I inadvertently discovered he had been writing massive and dramatic emails to the same girl saying that he had made a huge mistake and he loved her, etc. I left him on the spot. I called the girl “again” in a raging frenzy- I was pissed she didn’t contact me. I really didn’t need to do that though. I told a few of my good friends our situation. They were in shock. Somewhere inside, amidst all the chaos from the events, I felt liberated. I was free. 

Over time, however, I allowed myself to get dragged back into the relationship. Our relationship has gotten better. But there have been several “lesser” awful and traumatic incidents which have occurred over time. He kept pictures of the girl secretly stored in his phone, he made a secret Reddit account and commented on the NSFW pictures of women that shared the same origin as the girl. There are probably other things I don’t know about. I know what this looks like in writing. I have enough insight to realize that I have chosen a life of pain. But those decisions belong to me, and where I take my life next is a dialogue I can only have with myself.

Tldr: Stayed in a committed relationship after a series of serious emotional affairs. Below is a list of advice to those who can relate.

Although every relationship has its series ups and downs, emotional/physical cheating is a violation that sends a toxic in the main artery of the shared connection. These are broad generalizations and surely others would disagree. That’s okay too. 
I’m just speaking from experience.

So, in hindsight here is my advice to anyone really looking to stay committed:

You will begin to normalize pain/resentment in a relationship. Sure, you can still have good moments with your partner that wronged 
you, but those hurt feelings stay on your heart like a tar stain. 

Sometimes you are just better at putting those emotions in compartments and sometimes they surface back in full gear. Resentment, anger, sadness, playing the victim all seem to inevitably resurface at varying times and in varying degrees. Time just desensitizes you of those feelings.

If some of your friends and family are aware of the situation, you’ll be uncomfortable around them if your SO is present. It took me a very long time to relax around my friends. More than anything, they were concerned about me. More than anything, I was just judging myself.

You will feel shame. Beyond the anger and the tears, you will feel shame for sticking by your SO and not doing what should have probably been done.

There’s bound to be more drama manifested in different ways. Okay, so your SO is no longer being deviant. Is the underlying problem truly resolved or is it lying dormant deep inside him/her. I won’t deny that people who cheat, especially repeatedly, have huge emotional problems. People who try to reconcile the relationship also have emotional issues to be addressed. Either way, it takes a huge commitment to the other person and to yourself to want to really understand and resolve the driving forces behind the adultery.

It’s more work to stay.

Ultimately, it’s a life choice. Do I deserve to be happy? Do I deserve respect, and more importantly self-respect? We have to be accountable for our own actions and decisions. Blaming someone else for our own unhappiness solves nothing. What is right for one person may not be right for another.

I have been dating my SO for 5 years now, and we have had very very little drama in our relationship. A huge contributing factor to this is the fact that my previous relationships have almost always been with a woman who was non-confrontational and used to bottling emotions. My current SO came from a family which was very passive-aggressive, which is a complete contrast to the way in which I was brought up, which was that when you have a problem, you confront the person with whom you have the problem and talk it out.


Now that you have the background, allow me to share this tip for anyone who may use it:

* whenever you get the feeling that something you have said in an argument has gone too far, or was unjustifiable, or attributable to raw emotion (Which is a realization that occurs almost instantaneously after uttering the words.) **Apologize!!** While this may seem obvious to some, this is something which is often overlooked in the heat of the moment, and the importance of stopping the conversation, the screaming, the shouting, what have you, is not only so that you can admit that you have done wrong by saying something that was out of line, but it also gives the other person a feeling of security that you can reign in your emotions and realize that you have hurt them.

I reiterate that I am fully aware that this advice will seem simple and benign to most who read this subreddit. However, I can absolutely promise you that applying this approach, of not waiting 5 hours before apologizing but rather instantly admitting fault and continuing the argument in a productive manner, will lead to much healthier, and longer lasting relationships. It shows your SO that you are also viewing the argument from their perspective, which is so easy to forget to do.


Anyways, that's all. I hope this helps someone out there as much as it has helped me, and as a final thought I want to leave you with something a psychologist told me when I was 13 years old that has helped me on a daily basis ever since.

The average human has the following thought process when in an argument or altercation:  Event-----Emotion------Reaction. If you wish to dramatically improve all of your relationships, all you need to do is add one simple step: Event-------Emotion-------**Rational Thought**------Reaction. 

The introduction of something so simple, at such a difficult moment will not only make your arguments go better, but will give the other person an added measure of respect for you.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

**tl,dr:** Admit instantly when you are wrong, and apologize. Take a moment to think rationally before succumbing to an emotional response.

I'm 24 been with my boyfriend almost 2 years, I tell him pretty much everything. If he asks about my day, I mention notable occurrences, and (as many women can attest) this sometimes involves being hit on. Sometimes I mention it because it was funny, other times because the guy was persistent/being annoying so it stuck with me. If someone shouts at me on the street, it's a small, passing event so I won't mention it.

My boyfriend never seemed bothered by my mentioning this, so I never thought twice about it. It would never occur to me to try to make my boyfriend jealous, it's just a part of my day so I mention it along with other things. 

However, a guy friend of mine recently suggested he might not like to hear this, and that most guys don't.

Obviously you can't generalize about any gender or experience, and we communicate pretty well so if I'm really curious I'll just ask my bf. But I'd like to know your personal feelings on the subject. Personally, I'm an open book, and I dislike the idea of keeping things that happen to me from my boyfriend, but I also respect his right to be sheltered from information that bothers him. **How do you feel about girlfriends talking about being hit on? If it bothers you, do you think this is a rational annoyance?**

*More specific question*: I had a boss who was hitting on me a while back. I ran into him once or twice at a club and he told me he had feelings for me, and was jealous of my boyfriend. I didn't tell my boyfriend about this because I didn't want him to worry when I went to work every day, it didn't seem fair since I actually saw this man every day. I have since left the company, but I definitely felt conflicted keeping this information from my boyfriend.

I was questioning when was the right time and what not, and right before bed I just came out with it. I gave her some statistics and told her other information, and to my surprise, she was calm, cool, collected and she still fucking loves me. I told her how embarrassed I was and she reassured me that nothing should be embarrassing between her and I. We then we cuddled to bed and this morning she just asked when I wanted to go get the vaccine with her. Had breakfast and everything seems even better than normal.

We went to the same high school together. Kind of a ""knew but never actually met"" sort of thing, we'll call her Liz for the sake of the story. She was dating a Basketball player, I was dating a cheerleader, so often during basketball games we'd wind up in the stands together. I never had the nerve to talk to her. Girls like her don't even throw a second glance at guys like me, so I didn't even bother trying.  

*Fast forward 6 years.*

I was in college for the second time living with a close friend of mine in a small bachelor pad uptown. Seeing this girl who lived outside of the city, bored with the relationship, ready to cut my losses and move on. At this point I was in college for the second time. A friend of mine calls up and says he's been hanging out with this girl and wants me to come out with them on Friday night. I don't see any harm in it so out I go. Sure enough it's Liz, the girl from high school, the one with the beautiful smile, always known to me as the unattainable. We get talking at the bar, she's still with dickhead, they've been together for about 6 years and she says she's miserable, she says she wants out but doesn't know how to get out, she says he's verbally abusive, has no trust in her, and constantly keeps tabs on her. He was out of town for the weekend so she managed to escape for a night. We talked for hours, and when closing time came around she came with us back to my place. We sat out on the deck and talked until the sun came up, in the morning I took her home expecting to never hear from her again.  

A week or so passed, I broke up with the girl I was seeing, and was know worse off. Late one night a text message comes through, I'll never forget what it said, ""Hey, it's Liz, I got your number from Keith, I just really need someone to talk to right now."" So she called me, her boyfriend the basketball player (we'll call him Chad) had just tore her apart, called her useless, ugly, a slut, every name under the sun. All for wanting to wear a skirt out that night, he said she just wanted attention from guys. I talked to her, made her feel better, and we planned to meet up later that week while he was at work.  

*First kiss.*

She dropped by my place after Chad had left for work, she came in and we talked a bit, she said he apologized as he always did after a freak-out. She said she was just sick and tired of it, but having been with him for six years, she didn't know how it was possible to just leave. At the age of 20, six years seems like a lifetime. I gave her some advice to the best of my ability, cheered her up, and soon she was on her way. She stopped just outside the door, took me by the hand, smiled, and said ""Thank you."" I instantly remembered that smile, the way it used to captivate me back in high school. She leaned in and kissed me, nothing was said, then slowly walked down the stairs and left. I just stood there in the door way in disbelief, after all, girls like that don't even give guys like me a second glance.  

*Chad*  

Chad was a year younger than me, but I remembered him quite well from high school. He was a cocky, egotistical, arrogant jerk who would do everything in his power to see things go his way. He knew good and well that his relationship was falling apart, but the bottom line was he'd rather see her miserable with him then happy with someone else.
After high school he never really did anything with his life, worked a few shitty construction jobs here and there just long enough to get unemployment. She had told me he was planning on going away to school to become a cop or some shit but that never happened (at least not to my knowledge).  

*The plot thickens.*  

We've been hanging out whenever she could sneak away for about a month now. I'm falling for her, and I believe she's falling for me. Things haven't gone beyond simple kissing, we've just been enjoying each others company. It's late on a Saturday night, we're parked out behind the airport sitting on the hood of my jeep watching the planes land when her phone starts ringing. It's Chad, and he's freaking the fuck out. ""You told me you were at Alisha's and when I went there looking for you she said you were never there at all, so where the fuck are you Liz? huh? You worthless slut, just wait 'till I find out who you're with, FUCK, are they ever gonna be sorry."" She starts to cry, hangs up and turns off her phone, gives me a soft kiss, and just whispers, ""you should probably just take me home, he won't stop until he finds me."" I refuse, I explain that I won't be responsible for my actions if he lays a hand on her. She assures me that he won't, so I take her home.
She calls me the following night, it was business as usual, he freaked out, started crying, then apologized.  

*""The downward spiral.""*  

We've been meeting up secretly for a for about three months now. It's getting to be a lot harder on both of us. I miss her when we're not together, she's a wreck, cries when she see me and runs into my arms, cries when she has to leave. I know I can't keep this up, it's just to hard, but I also can't just let he choke on the noose around her neck. So I stay strong, I'm her rock when she needs me to be, I'm there any time she calls, available anytime she can meet up.  

You see, being the ""Other Man"" is tough. You can't have any self respect. If you have an ounce of it you'll open your eyes, think logically, and realize what your doing is killing you. I hate Chad, I hate him so much for the way he treats her, but not half as much as I hate myself for doing this to him. I know, it sounds strange, but that's the truth. I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror out of fear of catching a glimpse of the monster I had become. The stress was astounding and constant. I felt empty, like what I was doing had hollowed me out inside and the only thing that could fill the void was her. He got into the habit of calling her almost every hour on the hour just to check up on her to see where she was, what she was doing, who she was with, etc. It got to the point where us hanging out was barely enjoyable, we just spend our time waiting in between his calls.  

Time rolls onward, six months deep now. I'm stretched to my limits and so is she. We both agree we can't do it anymore. I explain to her I just can't handle the constant stress. Always watching my back, worried that he'll find out. She still wants to be able to talk to me now and again, the last thing I said to her before she left was ""As long as he's part of your life I can't be, I love you, Liz. I just can't do it anymore, I'm not asking you to choose him or me, I'm the decision easy on you. If you choose to stay with him and try to make things work I'll disappear and you'll never hear from me again. It'll be like it never happened."" She couldn't even look at me, she was crying to heavily to talk, she just nodded, and turned to walk away. I honestly didn't expect to ever see or hear from her again, and I was heartbroken in a way I didn't even think was possible.  

*The Climax.*  

About two weeks have passed since Liz walked out my door. I'm still reeling from the final blow when I get a phone call. I don't recognize the number, but I was on call that day for work so I answered anyways. It's Chad, and he's flying off the handle in a way I can't even express. Yelling with everything he had, calling me every name in the book, death threats, threats on my family, anything and everything he could think of. I don't say a word, I just listen. I deserve this. I deserve to have my teeth kicked down my throat, to be beaten within an inch of my life, I deserve it all. He eventually gets tired of yelling and hangs up. I had got a text message during the call, It was Liz, she had broken up with him two days ago, and he just wouldn't let it go so she told him about me. This was under the expectation that he would be so pissed at her that he would want nothing to do with her. This expectation was wrong, very wrong.  

The phone calls from him become a daily thing but I won't change my number, I deserve this, everything he's saying is true. Liz just apologizes over and over again, I don't care, I'm just happy that she now has a chance to be happy, with or without me. I explain to her that she needs to get her head on straight before anything else. She needs to take some time to come to terms with everything, I won't be a rebound, not after all of this. She understands. We talk every other day on the phone and things are going well, she's healing, learning that there is a life out there waiting to be lived.  

*The Aftermath*  

We eventually started hanging out again, taking things slow, not rushing in to anything. Chad still calls her from time to time when he's drunk, and I even get a phone call from him every now and again. At this point it's been about 8 months since all this started and we've officially started to see each other. Things go amazingly, the relationship is effortless, we never fight, we barely even ever disagree, it almost seems to good to be true. I don't believe in happily ever after, I don't think it exists. Relationships are like an old car, they require constant maintenance and if you ignore them, they fall apart (A quote from my father).  

*Conclusion*  

It's been about 2 years now, almost to the day. Things between me and Liz are still strong as ever. However, not a day goes by that I don't remember that feeling I had that summer, that inescapable darkness that nearly consumed me, I'll carry it with me until the day I die. It changed me forever for better or worse, but for Liz, I'd do it all over again.  

**TL;DR : The Other man isn't really a man at all, he's just a frightened dog hiding under a table, hoping the storm will soon pass.**  

My advise to anyone who is now, or plans on putting them self into a situation like the one I just described, is make damn sure she's/he's worth it, and be prepared for everything to fall apart at any moment.

Any others?,24,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/pxcpk/a_few_ideas_that_have_made_my_long_distance/,"**1)** Buy her dinner. At some point during the day, call her and ask her what she's doing for dinner. Tell her that you are buying her dinner and coordinate a deliver time for when she will be home. Beforehand, find out what her favorite take out or hangover food is, then call the restaurant and order it for her (deliver to her address, but you pay for it). 
**Pro-tip:** Call her while she's at work so her coworkers will notice.

**2)** Give her a daily gift. The next time you see each other, give her a jar with her favorite candy in it. But put enough pieces in there so that she eats one piece each day until you see each other next. Every time she misses you, she eats a piece of candy. So, if it's going to be 60 days until you see each other, put 60 Reese's Pieces in there. 
**Pro-tip:** Also give her a whole bag of that candy so if she really misses you, she can pig out.

**3)** Send her a pet. Buy a doll of an animal and mail it to her. Then, the next time you talk after she gets it, both of you come up with a name. I personally think buying her a pony is the best choice, but perhaps a parrot or a frog would be good too. 
**Pro-tip:** Poke holes in the box.

**4)** Assume a fake identity and compliment her. Call her and pretend you are the President and are offering her the Medal of Honor for going above and beyond the call of duty in her relationship. Pretend you are a mutual friend walking past her house and say she has a hot body. Pretend you are the police and she's getting a ticket for stealing your heart. Pretend you are the IRS and she's getting audited for not claiming her high value ""assets,"" and then list off her best features. 
**Pro-tip:** Just call her.

**5)** Draw together online. Both go online to a website [like this](http://www.doodletoo.com/#/lobby), and draw messages to each other. 
**Pro-tip:** Skype while you draw.

**Super Bonus Pro-tip idea:** [Hoochy Mail.](http://www.hoochymail.com/) Slightly NSFW.

Other cliches include: postcards, Skype dinner dates, written letters, burning a cd of your favorite songs, buying her your favorite cologne so she can spray it on things so they smell like you, and good ole fashioned phone sex.

During this time, I’m setting aside my to do list for an even better list: how to relish and make the most of my time with loved ones.

1. Be present in the moment. There will always be things to get done. Let them go. This advice is why I remember my wedding day. As I walked down the aisle, danced the first dance and greeted guests, I momentarily paused in my heart to take a picture of what was happening. Soaking it in I paid attention to details, relishing the moment and allowing it to sink into my long term memory where it will be cherished forever.

2. Listen. Loving well is listening well. Focus not just on the words, but the hearts of those around you.

3. Ask Good Questions. Become curious. Go beyond, how are you, to specific questions about work, dreams, life… You will be surprised by what you learn and your relationships will be strengthened and deepened.

4. Share of Yourself. People care about you and want to know you. Be willing to share your heart and stories with those you love, allowing them to know you.

5. Tell Them You Love Them. My family says I love you frequently. It’s the most important thing we say. We also live out our love for one another through our actions, demeanor and words.

I’m looking forward to this time with family and am taking four days off work to maximize my time with them.

This is my disclaimer:

**Disclaimer:** The opinions expressed represent my own and only my own. They are conjecture and speculation based solely on my observation and personal experience. This is not a comprehensive compendium covering concerning situations completely. (It is not intended to answer any and all problems, in fact. It's not intended to answer any problems at all) 

**The problem/observation:** The problems and most of the advice here is based around and phrased in the context of ""*what* should I do?""

* I'm feeling something I don't like, how do I handle it?
* My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike, how do I handle it?
* Should we stay together or break up? 
* How do I start a relationship with a boy/girl?

The majority of problems expressed around these parts are variations of these questions. I'll address each of them individually, but the gist is this:

**The Gist:** I feel the *approach* to a problem is of equal importance as the solution. Very little attention is paid in regards to *HOW* someone should *think* about the problem that they are currently addressing. This type of mental engineering can be a powerful tool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I'm feeling something I don't like, how do I handle it?**

First you need to identify whatever it is causing you to feel the way you do. 

Are you depressed? Yes. Something happened.  
Are you jealous? Yes. I can't trust my SO.  

Next, ask yourself it you're being rational. Set the bar of proof VERY high for this one. EVERYONE has a bias toward themselves. Even you. You need to assume you're irrational and prove beyond a doubt that you're rational. 

Two favorite tests of mine:

1) Is there an actual event that exists in *reality* beyond your personal perception or interpretation to validate your feelings.

* You were dumped. 
* You were lied to. 
* Someone said you were ugly.

2) Does the problem and consequence exist entirely in your mind?

ex: I can't talk to that girl I don't know because (I'm uncomfortable, I don't want to be rejected, I don't want to feel embarrassed). 

You COULD go talk to her. And as long as you don't provoke physical violence (unlikely), there is no REAL consequence outside your own mind. If you could just decided that the problem and consequence didn't exist, they wouldn't exist.  

**Your feelings are rational:**

If you prove to yourself that what you're feeling is rational. There is a ""thing"" or person you can address directly that you've already identified. Gather your patience and understanding. Confront. 

(If you were dumped, address the LOSS, not the PERSON.)


**Your feelings are irrational:**

Feels bad to be here. Basically, irrational feeling boil down to a few categories. 

&gt; I can fix these poisonous thoughts myself and they don't really affect my life/happiness. 

Work on yourself. Keep living your life. It's unlikely you're reading this.

&gt; I can't fix these poisonous thoughts myself, but they don't really affect my life/happiness.

Casually ask friends to keep an eye out or accept it as a ""quirk.""

&gt; I can fix these poisonous thoughts myself, but they affect my life/happiness.

Seriously spend time on yourself. Force yourself and your mind to accept reality and reject your old way of thinking. Your mind is capable of some impressive agility once you've trained it. Having friends involved always helps. 

&gt; I can't fix these poisonous thoughts myself and they affect my life/happiness.

Gather your entire support structure around you. Seriously consider therapy or counseling.

I can't count how many times i read posts about how girlfriends and wives are ""FED UP"" with their boyfriend/husband's video gaming. You often see ""addiction"" and ""Habit"" in the titles of the posts. Your initial reaction is to think they don't care anymore, or they have found something better to do besides hang out with you. It sucks!! Why should he be on his game for hours while you wait around for some attention or together time with him? I consider myself an experienced gamer GIRLFRIEND. It takes a special kind to be able to tolerate this... and i was not one to be able to do this at first.

 * The first tip any gamer boyfriend will give you is ""play with me"". DO IT! Try it, you might like it. I, myself have tried this several times but honestly if you aren't a gamer girl... you aren't a gamer girl. Keep in mind, it never hurts to give it a shot. 

 * Know what he is talking about when he is telling you about his game. They genuinely want to have a conversation with you about something they like and it helps if you chime in once in a while, or even ask questions! It might impress him to know that you pay attention to what he is saying and that you want to know whats going on with his hobby. Toss in terms like Ganking, Jungling, Farming, ect. 

 * You need to set boundaries, although there is a nothing wrong with him playing games for a few hours a day  but time needs to be set aside for the both of you to spend together. The best thing to do is talk about what issue you have with his gaming up front. 
If he is anything like any gamer i have dated, they will probably be defensive on thinking they don't spend THATTT much time playing. Oh they do. They are on gamer time which goes by 100x's faster than real time (meaning that they don't realize they are on the game for hours and hours and hours) key words: THEY DON'T REALIZE. Stand your ground and come to an agreement!

 * Be upfront with your feelings! Men and woman are obviously different in the ""feeling and emotions department"" My current boyfriend is pretty black and white when it comes to feelings, up front and it is what it is. If you have an issue with how things are going in the gaming department then you need to be upfront. This isn't going to work if you continue spending this long on a game. It really hurts me because i never get to spend time with you and it feels like you don't care."" Although you have no intention of breaking up with him you NEED to emphasize that it WILL NOT work if you guys have no time together. 

 * Compromise. As my boyfriend says ""He has been playing games his whole life so it has grown to have sentimental value and girlfriends don't understand that""  He is also playing Diablo3, we don't live together anymore so it is much easier to give him 2-3 days out of the week where i don't stay over there and he has the night to himself. Monday, Tuesday, and sometimes Wednesday he has the night alone to play his game and we skype together while he does so. This way we can still talk and he can play at the same time. We both essentially get what we want. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday we spend together. That doesn't mean he doesn't play his game at night. BUT we spend our days together doing things like, going out to eat or watching a movie and then at night i don't feel so neglected from our time together because we spent most of the day together! A good way to preface this is ""Hey we could go do something today and later you can play your game while i do this.""
You cant expect him to drop his games all together, our generation has been playing video games almost our entire lives, and if you cant hang, then you aren't cut out for this. 

 "" Do something you love, while hes doing something he loves! Usually while he is on the game i am doing something else like working on our scrapbook, on reddit or couponing ect. It helps time go by with something i like to do, i usually don't notice he is gaming. 

I hope these tips helped out a fellow Gamer Girlfriend. The key is compromise between the 2 of you. He compromises by cutting his gaming to certains day of the week or certain times of the day so you guys are both happy. It CAN work if you make it work :)

Marriage.

“When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I’ve got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.

Suddenly I didn’t know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn’t seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why? 

I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn’t talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to Jane. I didn’t love her anymore. I just pitied her! 

With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved Jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. 

The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn’t have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with Jane. When I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. 

In the morning she presented her divorce conditions: she didn’t want anything from me, but needed a month’s notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month we both struggle to live as normal a life as possible. Her reasons were simple: our son had his exams in a month’s time and she didn’t want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. 

This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day. She requested that every day for the month’s duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. 

I told Jane about my wife’s divorce conditions. . She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. 

My wife and I hadn’t had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don’t tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. 

On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn’t looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. 

On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me. On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn’t tell Jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. 

She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily. 

Suddenly it hit me… she had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. 

Our son came in at the moment and said, Dad, it’s time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly; it was just like our wedding day. 

But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn’t noticed that our life lacked intimacy. I drove to office…. jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind…I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, Sorry, Jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. 

She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, Jane, I said, I won’t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn’t value the details of our lives, not because we didn’t love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away. At the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, I’ll carry you out every morning until death do us apart. 

That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting CANCER for months and I was so busy with Jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push through with the divorce.— At least, in the eyes of our son—- I’m a loving husband…. 

The small details of your lives are what really matter in a relationship. It is not the mansion, the car, property, the money in the bank. These create an environment conducive for happiness but cannot give happiness in themselves.

So find time to be your spouse’s friend and do those little things for each other that build intimacy. Do have a real happy marriage! 

If you don’t share this, nothing will happen to you. 

If you do, you just might save a marriage. Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.”",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_m4gmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/m4gmr/married_or_not_you_should_read_this/,
1371557845.0,19,self.relationship_tips,1gkw0v,Communication is talked about a lot. Can we have an elaborate discussion about everything it should include?,22,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1gkw0v/communication_is_talked_about_a_lot_can_we_have/,"Communication is always one of the most important requirements for a happy relationship. Maybe it's *the* most important. It ranks on top for me too. 

Communication to me is expressing one self at the initial stages of any issue creeping up or sensing to creep up. At times we keep things to ourselves. And later it explodes into something massive. Often leads to arguments/fights etc. 

I learned this myself recently. I used to be more affectionate one in my relationship. While she was the more quiet one. It bothered me a lot. And I started assuming that things would be okay after a while. But it didn't. I spent endless hours being bothered. I spent sleepless nights over it. And then I finally gave away. Told her what was bothering me. Turned out that she was just inexperienced with relationships and had no idea I liked getting her calls/texts randomly throughout the day. I laughed at myself later on how stupid I was to have not communicated it early on. It would have saved me a lot of sleepless nights and happy moments. 

So, that's the little story behind my brush with communication. 

Sometimes the other person isn't very communicative at all. They may love you more than you can even imagine. But no matter what the other person might not understand the power of communication. Or maybe they would need a few months or years of maturity to get to that level. What do you do then? How as a partner in the relationship can you help such a person to learn the art of communication?

My SO falls under this above category. She is a very good learner. The only thing I am bothered about is how do I as a partner help her out. I don't want to force it on her. Nor do I want to act any pushy. 

Apart from that, what are your thoughts about communication? What is your little story?

* **Fuck first** – nobody feels very sexy or limber after putting away half a cow for dinner. If you want to end the evening in bed then make sure you eat lightly and don't drink too much. 

* If you’re not trying to conceive, **make sure you’ve got condoms handy** – especially if you think you might be enjoying sexytimes after a drink or two.

* **Focus on making your partner feel special and appreciated.** Don’t buy a gift just because you think you’re supposed to buy a gift. If you rarely dine out, allowing yourselves to splurge might be nice. If you dine out often and don’t usually do the cooking, why not plan a special meal for your partner and try your hand in the kitchen? Many things can be prepped a day or two ahead, allowing you to spend less time cooking and more time with your partner. Don’t forget the candles!

* If you’re planning to dine out and enjoy a few alcoholic beverages, **plan ahead to make sure you get home safely.** Take a cab or other public transport to dinner, or limit your drinks and have a nice bottle of wine or champagne waiting for you at home. 

* **Ladies, this holiday isn’t just about you.** Even if you don’t plan a big date, take some time to think about things that would make your boyfriend or husband feel extra appreciated. Your efforts will be repaid many-fold.

* **Being thoughtful doesn’t have to cost a lot of money!** It’s great if you have the income to arrange for a couple’s weekend at the spa or a nice watch for your boyfriend, but don’t worry if you can’t.

* Be sensitive to your partner’s lifestyle. If your partner is trying hard to lose weight, consider buying flowers instead of chocolates.

* Don’t interpret “we don’t really have to do anything this year” to mean “do nothing”. You don’t need to run out and arrange for a fireworks display, but a thoughtful card and a couple of roses can go a long way.

* **For those in LDRs**, there are ways to celebrate your relationship without being together. Consider having flowers delivered to your girlfriend, or mailing a little surprise to your boyfriend. The next time you see each other, do the nice things you would have done if you’d been together on Valentine’s Day.

* If you’re going to break up with your SO – don't wait until after Valentine’s day. It may seem cruel to do it before but it’s probably better than waiting till after, and giving the impression you were faking it all day and/or only in it for the sex and chocolate. 

* As always, **we don't allow requests for help picking out gifts** on any of the subreddits in the /r/relationships community.  /r/gifts or /r/perfectgifts is are available for all of your gift-giving questions.

As a final thought, remember that February 14th is not the only day that you should put effort into keeping the romance alive in your relationship.  Take the time to regularly make your partner feel appreciated, even if it’s as simple as surprising him with his favorite cookie or preheating the electric blanket because you know she hates being cold.

They're yours now...",23,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/14t30e/someone_shared_these_guidelines_for/,"1. Take full responsibility for success in the communications process. As a listener, take full responsibility for hearing what others are saying. As a talker, take full responsibility for being certain that people understand what you are saying. Don't meet people halfway in your relationships. Always give 100%.

2. Look at yourself as others see you. Imagine being your parents. Imagine being the person who is in a relationship with you. Imagine being your employer. When you come into a room or into your place of work, what do you think peoples' first impression will be of you?

3. Rather than hearing what you want to hear, listen for the facts. Remember, everything you communicate is your opinion based on your limited impressions from limited sources. Keep expanding your information.

4. It's never too late to communicate. Don't wait for fear of what the response might be.

5. The vacuum created by a failure to communicate will quickly be filled by rumor, misrepresentation, drivel and poisonous thought.

6. In the communication process, knowledge is not always wisdom, sensitivity is not always accuracy, sympathy is not understanding, empathy is never assuming anything until you have been in that person's position.

7. Listen for the truth and speak the truth. Don't let a fad make you one of countless victims of greed. When you hear something that impresses you, check the validity of the source.

8. Look at everything you hear with an open-minded type of examination. Be open-minded enough to consider it without prejudice and be analytical enough to research and test the validity and integrity.

9. See both the positive and the negative sides of any issue, then pursue the positive side.

10. Shift your roles; change your roles easily and appropriately from a business executive to a courteous driver, to a friend, to a confidante, to a lover and to a teacher.

11. Consider the kind of people who you are attracted to and the kind of people to whom you are attractive.  Are they the same types? Do you attract winners?

I have read many books on relationships and the interactions between men and women--secular, Christian, daoist, geared toward men, toward women, toward marriage, toward dating--and this is by far the most insightful one. 

The book describes the way in which men and women are fundamentally different based on evolved physiological traits and socialization. Women are primarily fear-driven (fear of isolation &amp; loss) while men are primarily shame-driven (shame due to inadequacy). Here is a typical scenario:

Woman: If you did ______, I would feel (less anxious, more secure, more loved).

Man: If I do ______ just because you tell me to, I will feel (inadequate, resentful).

Woman: If you do _____ but feel *that* way, I will still feel (anxious, unloved, unsatisfied). If you *really* loved me, you would *want* to do _____.

Man: If you *really* love me, you wouldn't *ask* me to do ______.

Woman: Now I feel (anxious, disconnected, unloved).

Man: You have no right (reason) to feel that way. (Now I feel truly inadequate because whether or not I do _____ you will be unhappy).

Woman: You have no right to tell me not to feel that way. (Now I feel truly afraid because I think you don't love me).

This book explains how to break the pattern of anxiety-driven shaming of women to men, and shame-driven frightening of men to women. 

I have certainly felt anxiety dictating my thoughts. ""We haven't been spending as much time together. Our conversations aren't as long or in-depth. Is something wrong? I feel disconnected. I need him to spend more time with me or talk to me more.""

Meanwhile, his thoughts were, ""My girlfriend is here with me and safe, so I'm doing my duty to the relationship. It's nice having her here.""

So when I brought it up, ""We aren't spending as much *quality* time together. I feel disappointed and worried,"" even though I used my 'I' statement and didn't blame him, he still felt inadequate and apologized, ""for having disappointed"" me. Then he assured me I was 'overthinking'. 

I didn't want him to think if himself as a disappointment and he didn't want to minimize my fears, but these are natural reactions to the other genders' vulnerability. Once we can identify the actions, we can avoid those stereotypical arguments about 'communication' and instead take action to improve the relationship little by little. Communication isn't inherently effective when you're speaking two different languages; instead improve your connection through actions. 

TL;DR: Amazing book describes inherent differences in male and female psyches and provides information on how to *connect* rather than ineffectively communicating.

However, we really are just breaking even on our monthly budget with only my income.  Currently, my wife stays home with our 2 children while I work 40+ hours a week.  

I love that she stays home, and I want her to keep staying home and rearing our children.  However, I think she does a really bad job of keeping the house, and I'm not entirely convinced that she's doing anything of significant benefit for our kids.  I have put a lot of thought into this, and I hope this doesn't come across as me trying to make my wife into some June Cleaver fantasy.

She is the one that feels the financial stress.  She is the one that is concerned that we ""don't make enough money.""  I am confident that whatever happens, I know we can make it through.  We have a savings account with about 2 mos. expenses, we both have smart phones, we have cable, and we eat at restaurants 3-5 times a month FFS!  My point being that there is plenty of room in our budget to cut things, but every time I point that out, she is unreceptive because it generally means that she has to do without something that she likes or she has to do more work around the house, i.e. not eating out means cooking/dishes.

So, I'm wondering Reddit's thoughts about two things.  First, I don't want to kill myself trying to make more money.  If I work more, then I miss out spending time with my family which is the most important thing to me.  In fact, my dream is to live a life where we don't need money because we grow our own food and make whatever we need and spend all of our time together.  However, I'm not married to my dream, I'm married to my wife, and it's important to me that she be happy.  Her unhappiness seems to be connected to financial issues that we're not seeing eye-to-eye about.  Each time that I begin to raise these issues with her, she takes it very personally and nothing changes.  I am asking her to change the way she sees things pretty radically, and I understand that.  But I think she sees things wrongly, and I want us to line back up with each other.

Second, I think that if she cares more about these financial issues than being home with our kids, then I think she needs to get a job and find good childcare.  Am I way off base?


TL;DR Is there an easy way to tell your wife who stays at home that you think she can do a lot better job?  Or am I just an asshole?

1298858523.0,21,self.relationship_tips,fu0f9,Things I've learned thus far about dating.,23,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/fu0f9/things_ive_learned_thus_far_about_dating/,"Dating tips from a guy who is still single:

Tip 1: dress up. First of all, wear that favorite outfit of yours. You know that shirt you love and those jeans you think are so cool? Half of the battle is having enough confidence in yourself to KNOW you are going to look good and if you're wearing something you KNOW makes you feel good about yourself, you're going to be much better off.

Tip 2: Cologne. I love to wear cologne. I don't wear it every day, but I know when I am getting ready to go out on a date I make sure I am looking right and smelling great. Nothing gets that girl closer to you than smelling good. Also, don't spray too much. Three sprays around your neck is plenty.

Tip 3: Unless she says otherwise, you are paying for dinner. This is more of a gentlmen's rule than anything else, but a girl wants to see that you can pay that check without batting an eyelash. No one girl wants to hear ""um can you help pay for this?"" 

Tip 4: Have your own way to and from the date. If you don't have a vehicle for some reason, make SURE you have some way of getting from your date back home that doesn't involve her. If she wants to bail on you, don't make her feel like she has to drop youo off too.

Tip 5: Don't drink too much. Drink, have a few beers but make SURE she drinks more than you do. Offer to buy her drinks as well as your own. I have found if you are drunker than she is, it's no good. Plus, if you are sober you can make sure she gets home safe and sound.

Tip 6: Talk about her. The game of the conversation is to have HER talking more than you. Not that you should be silent, but ask her questions about her week, get her started talking and I guarantee she will have a better time. People LOVE to talk about themselves.

Tip 7: Look deep into her eyes. Women love it when you look right into their eyes while they talk or while you talk. Sometimes it's difficult at first because sometimes a woman's eyes can be amazing, but don't let her catch you looking at her chest. Sometimes, she won't even admit she caught you. The game here is, she WANTS you to look at her chest, but the more you look into her eyes, the more she is going to melt.

Tip 8: Go in with no expectations. If you are like me and do the internet dating, you've been talking to someone for a little bit, you got to know them and you are hoping with all your heart something is going to come from this. Well, dont. Too many times I have been disapointed by the person I saw because they didn't look like their picture, didn't act like the person I had chatted with perviously or a combination of both. Every so often, everything goes well, but go into the situation expecting that you may not end up wanting to date this person.

Tip 9: Don't be too nice. Alright guys, there is nice and then there is being too nice. Don't say ""I'm sorry"" to often. Don't tell her how amazing she looks more than one time (pick one time to say it and mean it that one time). Don't go out of your way to hold a door for her when she clearly has it herself. 

Tip 10: Schedule a bathroom break. Ok , this one is important. At some point in the date, tell the girl you have to go to the bathroom. This will give you a minute to really collect yourself and evalute how things are going. You can re-configure your strategy and come out of the bathroom as a whole different person. So, wash your face again, assuming no one else is in there, give yourself a little bit of a pep talk and walk out there with a smile on your face and a subject for her to talk about.


I would love other tips if I haven't covered them or discussion about the ones I have covered. Thanks. My hope is that this could be a very good check list for anyone going out on a first date with a girl they want to make a good impression on. Not written by some crazy doctor, written by real people in the dating world.

Edit: could someone give good advice on when/how to call after the first date? Is texting better than calling? What if you get a voice mail? How long before you can assume she didn't have a good time? Also, when is a good time to set up a second date? While on the first one? What if she starts telling you about something fun she is planning on doing? should you ask if she wants company? Could somebody talk about whether or not to go in for a kiss on the first date? should you just do it or ask her first?",,False,,t5_2sa5c,True,,,True,t3_fu0f9,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/fu0f9/things_ive_learned_thus_far_about_dating/,

A couple of weeks later I noticed some messages coming through 'whatsup' that were later deleted.  I checked the phone records and sure enough there were a lot of calls and text messages inter-exchanged.  

This is an android phone so I made a copy of all the files and then found the thumbnails of a bunch of deleted pictures with the guys face looking at the phone from different locations: the street, his house, his office, etc. And there was also a picture of him flexing in underwear. 

I tracked the guy down and he works in another very far away city, he was friends with my wife in facebook and I also found her wife in facebook. The guy is about 27 yo.

I initially asked my wife if something was going on and if she was cheating on me.  She said no and that she was only talking to some friends and that she was entitled to talk to friends. 

Then I confronted her with the pictures and she turned very apologetic, accepting that she did something wrong.  However, I dont think she came all the way forward as the only thing that she told me that happened was that during the training he asked her if she was ok while she was sick and when they had some beers with some other classmates she held her arm while walking. She said that she feels very sorry and that nothing happened and that she only got close to this guy because he was very attentive to her and that she 'liked the attention'. She said that she did not even like this guy.

She said that the underwear picture was a mistake and that they were only playing and that she was upset at the fact that he sent that.

Quandary: I'm with the love of my life--the one guy that I would spoon feed if he was ever injured, smooch on the face if ever maimed, and adore every wrinkle and grey hair he acquires. Everything is awesome. Always. Our family and friends are raucously supportive, and we are happy (in a very Taoist, just-living-life sense).

I want to marry him so that we can spend the rest of our lives together--something that, in my opinion, we've already begun. It should be on our time, when we're not so preoccupied with school, and when he's ready to ask. 

SO! I want to have this talk with him. Tell him that it's all good if we don't seal the deal. But, I don't want to sound dismissive about becoming betrothed (because I'd say yes in a heart beat!

Recent broken up with 23 year old female here. It was my longest relationship in a while: 7 months. It hurts, it sucks, we broke up because we wanted different things out of the relationship and he stopped liking me as much it seems. 

Anyway, a lot of the advice that I get after a break up is ""You need to be single before you can be with somebody else."" I get made fun of by my friends because I am notorious for not staying single for more than 5 months since I was 18. Relationships with me tend to end because people move away. 

I'm told that I need to grow while being single. I'm hearing it again with this break up. What I understand is this ""growing"" part. 
I come from a family where I had to grow up faster. I got little help from my parents as a kid and learned to be independent in my late teens. In my 20s, my father, who had me in his 50s, had started getting very old and again I had grow up faster than other adults who have yet to have to become the parent caretaker. 

Is it really detrimental for me to not stay single for more than 5 months? I don't go out looking for relationships, I just tend to attract people  (sorry that sounds cocky) and things happen. 
Is it really this important to be single if I already feel independent and quite grown up?

Hey Reddit! This might be a little long, and I apologize in advance. Skip down to the tl;dr, I won't be offended.

We've been dating for about a year and a half now, and I'm worried that it's just getting too comfortable? I don't know if this is normal. I remember when we first started dating, I'd get ridiculous butterflies if he even just grazed my arm, and the first time we kissed I felt like jumping up and down like an idiot; even when the stupid giddy phase passed, it was still obvious to me that I loved him more than anything. Now I'm just not as sure. I can't tell if this is the comfortable phase in the relationship or if it means the relationship is dying/dead and I'm just holding on because I'm afraid to leave my comfort zone. I think I'm happier with him than I am otherwise ( and for me, that would be enough to stay) but sometimes I'm worried that I'm confusing ""comfortable/content"" with ""happy"" and that there's a difference. In terms of physical attraction, I'm still very much attracted to him, and he sure acts like he's still attracted to me; we're probably both less attracted than we were a year ago though.

The other related thing that makes me uncomfortable is how, all of a sudden, I feel like I need more affection from him. He's never been a very affectionate person -- I don't get flowers on valentine's day, we don't celebrate monthiversaries/anniversaries/whatever (he acknowledged the anniversary, but no fancy date or anything), and he really doesn't like PDA (I'm not a huge fan of PDA either, but I mean, if we're taking a walk by ourselves and holding hands, he'll drop my hand as soon as he sees anyone he might know. Everyone knows we're dating, so I'm not afraid that he's hiding it or anything, PDA just makes him uncomfortable). It's not like any of this is new: it's been this way since we started dating, it's just only recently started bothering me. I don't know, is it worrisome that I need him to be affectionate now more than I did before? Sometimes I feel like I'm just trying to convince myself that we're still as perfect for each other as we used to be. 

Last bit of information, a little while before we started dating, he was done with his ex but having trouble breaking it off with her, and it was making him noticeably unhappy/grumpy. About 6 months into our relationship, he told me that he was the happiest he'd ever been. Now I and a few of our mutual friends have been noticing that he seems kind of down, compared to how he was last year. I've been chalking it up to the fact that he has more work this year and classes have been stressing him out, but my little paranoid inner voice is wondering if this is the same situation that was happening with his ex.

I haven't talked to him about my concerns because a significant part of me thinks that I'm just being crazy, and because even if I did talk to him about it, I don't know what he/we could do to fix anything.
This is my first relationship (parents didn't let me date in high school and I was a good kid), so I have no idea how any of this is supposed to go. I'm just looking for some perspective.

**TL;DR: 
""Spark"" died down in relationship, not sure if it died down too much or if this is normal. Having trouble deciding whether I'm just too afraid to leave the comfort zone that is this relationship or if I'm actually happy. This is the first relationship I've been in, so I have literally zero perspective about any of this and I'd really like some.**

The intimacy has always been very good. So good, in fact, that we tend to ""finish"" at the same time. Being intimate is not a problem. But lately, I find that my sex drive has decreased. It's not that I don't find her attractive--I very much do--, it's just that her sex drive is very intense, and I feel as though I'm not in the mood like I used to be. I just don't want her to think that it's her, because I don't believe it is. Last night, I wasn't in the mood, but she very much was. The night prior, however, we had some really good sex, so I thought I could ""psyche"" myself into it. I figured I'd just get in the mood once we got the ball rolling, which proved disastrous. I apologized to her and promised I'd never ""say yes when I'm 'not feeling it' again.""

Right now I am gearing up to graduate from college, and I have no prospects for a good job, and I am currently employed by my university, which means come May, I'm on my own. We don't live together now, but we are planning on moving in together June 1st.

I went in for a scheduled induction that evening at 7:30 PM. They had to dilate me first and then in the morning they were going to start contractions. Two hours into the dilation, around 11 PM, my water broke and I went into labor. My husband helped me through every contraction; holding my hand, massaging my back, and reminding me to breathe.

The baby wasn't tolerating me laying on my left side or back, so they put me on my right side. When I got to 3 cm, they gave me an epidural, and I fell asleep until 3 AM. I woke abruptly to the nurse telling me I had to go in for a c-section, since the baby wasn't tolerating contractions. They wheeled me into the OR, upped my epidural's strength, and put up a cover across my belly so I couldn't see them operate. As they pulled the baby out, they struggled to fit her through the opening and I could feel them tugging. They ended up having to knock me out, and I woke to my baby and smiling husband at my side.

It was 3:29 AM when my baby was born, so I was exhausted. I had to feed her pretty often, so the chances of me getting enough sleep to function were pretty slim. I was also thirsty and starving, but wasn't allowed to eat or drink for hours after the operation. I couldn't get out of bed for a long time, and when I was able to get up, it took me several minutes just to get out of bed.

While I was in the hospital over the next two days, my husband brought the baby over every time I needed to feed her, he walked her up and down the hallway to sooth her back to sleep, he changed her diapers, gave her her first bath, and learned how to swaddle her in blankets.

I could not have gone through this process alone, and I just want to say: I love you more than ever. Thank you for being an amazing husband and father!

[f30],22,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1dsi0s/why_is_it_such_a_big_deal_when_women_date_younger/,"I tend to connect a lot better to men who are 20-23 than men who are my age. Probably because in many ways, I'm ""behind"" in life. And to me it just seems natural to spend my time with other people who are like me, think like me and face the same (or at least similar) issues I do. Thus most of my friends are in the 20-23 age bracket.

However it seems society at large does not approve of this. I get lots of pretty nasty comments from people who are my own age. People tell me that I have work to do if I feel like I have so much in common with those who are about ten years younger than me. Thing is, in what way is this immoral? I can't imagine 30 year old men who date 20-23 year old women get this kind of crap all the time. All I want is to share intimacy with other consenting adults who are on the wavelength.

Right now it feels like society requires me to grow up and fix my life, ignoring my desires for intimacy while doing so. And I don't see why I can't enjoy the company of people I like as long as I'm actively working to catch up? Is it better if I instead try to date people my age, men whom I have almost nothing in common with? I've tried, and it just doesn't work for me.

I've seen relationships that have drama (most of them), and I've seen a small handful of relationships that never have any drama, ever.  The common threads in these rare zero-drama relationships are:  

* There is always a clear definition of who is responsible for what.  It can range from a typical 50/50 split to a Dom/sub-type relationship, but a task itself and the related sphere of responsibility always belongs to one person or the other, and the other person does not try to interfere.  
  
* Having a relationship with no drama is more important to at least one of the members than having the relationship itself is.  Many people will prioritize the relationship itself above and beyond anything else, which means they will accept any level of drama or unhappiness as a sacrifice on the altar of the relationship.  
  
* The participants place very few rules on each other.  The more rules people have, the more likely it is that one of them will get broken, and that generally causes drama.  The few rules that remain tend to be ones that are important enough to end a relationship over.

I see questions in the /r/relationships community all the time asking whether or not someone should break up with their SO, or if they did the right thing by breaking up with them. The conflict comes from the fact that aside from this one big flaw, the person is otherwise perfect and they have no other major issues - other things the poster finds important (sex life, communication, common interests, whatever) are all going swimmingly. But their SO has this one huge flaw that's bothering them, and they're not sure what to do about it. The question is usually something like this:

""My boyfriend goes out drinking often, and I really don't approve of it. I worry he'll get hurt somehow. He's not a bad person, there's nothing else really WRONG with him, but I can't get past this. Should I break up with him?""

""My girlfriend is very religious, and I'm atheist. We both refuse to budge on our stances, and our beliefs are starting to affect our life together. Should I just call it quits?""

""My boyfriend smokes marijuana, which I don't do, I have no interest in it. And I don't like who he turns into when he smokes - lazy, inconsiderate, and rude. Is this a dealbreaker or am I overreacting? Should I leave?""

If your SO has a huge flaw that is interfering with your enjoyment of them, even if they're absolutely fantastic people otherwise, the answer to the question ""should we break up"" is probably YES.

**Just because someone is a really good person doesn't necessarily mean they're very good FOR YOU.** Things like religion, politics, social habits, drug &amp; alcohol use, views on family obligations... those things can often be dealbreakers. **It's up to you whether or not they are** - no one on reddit is going to be able to advise you on that. But if what they're doing really and truly bothers you, then this person is most likely NOT a good match for you.

Again, a good person isn't always gonna be good for you personally. Break up with them, free them (and yourself) up for someone whose values match up more.

edit: Added details to make it clearer that communication is not an issue for the couples in question. This post assumes that each party has made their values clear, and the objectionable behavior or habit or belief is a part of who the SO is, not something they are, or are ever likely to be, flexible on; or, even if they tried to change this, their lifestyle and habits and priorities don't really allow for that and they go right back to it again.

I did not properly communicate my emotions to my wife (F43), a beautiful, loving, dedicated woman. Because of this, I acted out after 9 years of our relationship in ways that may not be forgiveable. If she can forgive I am not sure she can ever trust.
What I'm trying to say is if you don't let your true feelings be known, for whatever reason, you may just crack eventually and risk losing what is most important to you.
I was an upstanding human for 97% of my life. I was always faithful and dedicated to the life we are supposed to live. Even when I knew my first marriage was over I maintained my integrity. In this marriage I did too, for 8 of 9 years. Then I snapped. I tried to place some of the responsibility on her, not for the cheating, as my emotions were minimalized throughout our marriage. That, however, was my fault. I did not stand my ground. I allowed her to turn it all back on me. Now I may have lost everything.
The true love of my life has now seemingly fallen in love with another man and he is a great guy. He's not the man I can be for my family, but he's no slouch. All of this because I didn't clearly communicate where I was at and what I was feeling. I hope beyond hope that I can show her how much I love her and my children and we can be a family again. However, I won't blame her if she won't open herself to the chance she might once again feel the pain I have caused her.
I never believed emotional pain could hurt physically. It can. It feels like a flu almost. Vomiting and aching muscles. The only difference is no fever and a serious want for anything that can numb the pain. Please don't put yourself where I have.

I know that this is a problem that eventually happens as the magic wears off in long-term relationships.  But we've only been together seven months, though we've had more than a year of history, and we've been friends for years.  

When I point it out, he blames how we've both busy and stressed, then asks if that makes me sad (does it not make him sad??).  He tells me that this is a problem we can fix, and then maybe we'll have sex the next day, and then it's back to the way it was.  I think sex is a really crucial part of being close in a relationship - oral sex or even making out is a start, and even someone who is busy and stressed should be down to do that.  I'm starting to feel like I'm just his friend that sleeps in the same bed, and maybe occasionally kisses him, but not his girlfriend.

Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just not making my desires clear enough, not initiating clearly enough.  I've almost stopped initiating entirely, since I feel increasingly rejected when he's hard, I reach my hand down his pants, and he pulls it away.  I used to accept this since everyone is sometimes just not in the mood.  But now I'm getting afraid that he's no longer attracted to me.  Every rejection, which I once would have accepted, just squashes my confidence.  And lack of confidence is an unattractive thing, I know that, and that makes me feel even worse.

This relationship has been the most solid and healthy one I've ever had, and I'm afraid my insecurities, or possibly his lack of attraction to me, are going to sabotage it.  I know he still loves me, since he's still affectionate and cuddly and wants to spend time with me.  But how can I deal with my fears?  Should I talk to him?  What can I say?

She never dated the guy - they have always been just friends.  They've kept in touch over the years and I became friendly with him too, however over the past year or two their communications has gotten a little strange.  More specifically, the way he communicates with her has gotten a little strange.  

Before going any further, it's worth mentioning that my wife has been 100% open with me about her communication with him.  She shows me all the emails, text messages, etc. they send each other.

So back to this guy.  Whenever he contacts my wife, it's usually via email with titles like ""Thinking of you...""  Or an email that ends with ""if you ever need me...""  She's gotten text messages from him at midnight where he'll say something like ""I was just doing xyz and thought of you...""  His communications are EXTREMELY complimentary of my wife.  He'll say things like ""I can tell you things that I can tell anyone else"" or ""you're such a great friend for letting me turn to you in times of need"".  Or he'll invite her out to lunch under the premise that he needs to talk about something in person but can't do it via email or over the phone.  I think my wife feeds off his behavior, probably because he is so complimentary of her and because it doesn't mean as much when it comes from me (again, we've been married 10 years...)

Did I mention that he's married?  And sometimes their discussions have been about how difficult things are in his own marriage? 

I've talked to my wife several times and explained that the way he communicates with her makes me feel uncomfortable.  I don't plan on telling her to stop being friends with him, but at the same time if I were receiving emails from another married woman saying the same things, I know my wife would hit the roof.  Or if I were sending emails to another married woman saying these things, she would definitely hit the roof.

I can't punish my wife for the way this guy communicates with her, but I also feel like this relationship is on the verge of being inappropriate.  Since I've already told my wife how I feel, should I just let it go?  Should I somehow step in and let this guy know that the way he talks to my wife is making me feel uncomfortable?

Haven't seen the girlfriend since she's been out of town for work on Sunday.  She comes back tonight and I'm less inclined of doing this then but I thought I'd start planning.

There's a window between Valentine's Day and our anniversary in the summer where there are no other holidays or anniversaries for her to accuse me of dumping her with ""bad timing.""  Suffice it to say her fall birthday, our sex anniversary, her working a retail job over the holidays, christmas, NYE and V-Day make 4 months of avoiding a crying, guilt trip mess.

So I've thought about using ""I"" statements, not yelling at her about anything, having clear reasons I want to breakup and why it has to be this way.

(my notes)

Reasons to break up:

Our schedules are different and hard to make a meaningful relationship work
-Going to bed on time, getting to go out
-Waking up on time, not disturbing the other person
-Making dinner on time
-Having quality time together (not just hanging out)

I'm having problems that I haven't shared fully
-I'm addicted to the internet and it's affected my judgement and time management severely
-I haven't cleaned my apartment in months
-I don't eat well
-I rush and stress myself out and then don't have time to be healthy
-I'm a coward who fears your unhappiness and by bottling up these thoughts I've become unhealthy.  I need to be honest.

I'm no longer romantically in love with you but I do care about you
-I want you to be happy and have fun
-I want you to feel loved and desired by a partner who can take care of you and satisfy you
-I want you to feel secure in your work/social settings/relationship with a romantic partner
-I want you to feel that your partner is your teammate: they're on your side, have your back, work for your happiness
-I can't do this for you.  I no longer feel comfortable calling myself your teammate when I have a different vision from you

I don't want to take a break.
I don't want to plan a way to fix this.
I don't want to plan a way to gradually let go.
I don't want to lie to you, hide my feelings from you or myself

I would like to be supportive of you in any non-romantic way you want but if that isn't possible then we have to let go

(Things I don't want to say)
I want to see other people
I want to have more time to myself
I don't want spend the rest of my life with you
I don't want to have children with you
I don't want to marry you


My fears:
Her crying, pleading, telling me not to go but to stay and talk, the promises that it'll be better and that it has been better, telling me she'll be a wreck and can't work and will lose her job, blowing up my phone and trying to ignore her, her getting angry and revealing secrets/talking shit or being destructive* somehow

Some hope:
I'm encouraged by how frequently she's been hanging out with other people without me around.  Since she's been gone we haven't talked on the phone and texted sparingly without much emotion.  She knows I want to break up with her.  

She's said in the past few months things like, ""Help me find a boyfriend,"" ""I can't find anyone else like you,"" and, ""I'm in constant fear of you breaking up with me.""  So...she knows it's coming.  We've talked about it and she's said that she's talked to other people about it, summarizing with,  ""We don't know what to do but we know it won't last.""

Everyone around me is so neurotic and impulsive and so quick to jump to conclusions. Obviously, I have moments like these. But 90% of the time, I feel like an old man living amongst these people. And I love them, but I just can't imagine being with these sorts of people for my entire life.

Remember those videos that were flying up on YouTube last year? The ""It Gets Better"" videos? They were all geared towards middle-schoolers, high-schoolers, pre-adolescent and adolescent kids. But I still feel like I'm stuck in that world. The only difference is this: those around me are more tactful. Everyone is just as selfish as they were just three, four, or five years ago. However, instead of outwardly hurting or bullying someone, there is more careful planning of achieving one's goals.

I would love to find a girl who just... wants to have a loving, caring relationship barring all of the bullshit. But as I've found out from dating all of these women and even just from having friendships with my guy friends, no one knows how to function without the bullshit. My ex-girlfriend really amplified the pessimism I'm having now.
Does this mellow out later in life? I really don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I thought things would be different in my early 20s. They're not.

This has its ups and downs: the ups are I'm very, very in love with this girl and see long-term potential.  The downside is that I've been far more sensitive than usual, probably because I don't want such an amazing thing to get messed up. 

One area where this has really been manifesting itself is when we have to be long distance.  I have just started a full-time job that requires some travel, and I find that during these distance breaks, I get super paranoid/jealous/unhappy when I have no logical reason to be.  Really, there's no logical reason, no ACTUAL suspicions, and considering how in love with me she is, I have no reason to doubt anything.  Nonetheless, the smallest things have been driving me insane when long distance.  For example, if a day has gone by when she didn't say ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"", I get super paranoid and it ruins my day.  I start thinking that maybe she doesn't love me and I get sad.  I basically turn into this whiny, sensitive bitchy guy that is not who I really am. This is the first time in my life I've ever acted like this, and I feel that the reason I'm so paranoid and unhappy when apart is because I love this girl so much and see such a future.  There's some of this in person too: whenever we have small conflicts, I feel like both of us take it super hard because we're afraid of messing up the relationship.

Another thing to note is I DO have a social life, even when away from her.  This is definitely something that helps, but nonetheless, I really feel the separation from her weighing on me.

How can I have more confidence and enjoy my life during these long distance periods?  It's really hurting my mood and enjoyment during my business trips.  How can I get over irrational suspicions and nervousness about the relationship?

Thought others who struggle through certain relationship issues might find out somemore about themselves. 

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/108jzz/nice_guy_symdrome_very_important_issue_for_fappers/

I'm currently reading a book about Nice Guy Symdrome. The author lists many characteristics of ""Nice Guys"" that i'd like to share with you. I used to be a ""Nice Guy"" before my NoFap challenge - i'm changing now. I think that you guys will identify yourself with many of those characteristics. One detail that the author doesn't know: ""Nice Guy Syndrom"" is TOTALLY related to fapping. I thank God and NoFap for saving me of this shit. Here we go:

Nice Guys are givers. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them.

Nice Guys fix and caretake. If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

Nice Guys seek approval from others. A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women.

Nice Guys avoid conflict. Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.

Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.

Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys repress their feelings. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. Due to their childhood conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, angry, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.

Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own.

Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships.

What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?

We might be tempted to minimize the problem of the Nice Guy Syndrome. After all, how can being nice be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.

Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs and behaviors. When I begin working with these passively pleasing men, almost without exception, they all ask, ""What is wrong with being a Nice Guy?"" Having picked up this book and puzzled over the title, you may be wondering the same thing.

By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest . Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: l Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. l Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. l It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential. ""

My boyfriend is a pretty big dude, which doesn't bother me in terms of aesthetics, but he has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea...and let me tell you, it is scary as shit hearing the person you love the most fight to breathe at night.  He's been decent about modifying his diet when I'm around, and he'll go to the gym if I go, but when I'm not around I know he eats bullshit and with our work schedules that vary week by week, it's hard to always find the time to go together (and I'm in MUCH better shape than he is, so it's not as critical that I go as often).  He would be perfectly content eating bacon and watching TV/playing on the computer all day if I didn't get him doing other stuff, which has turned me into the nagging bitch girlfriend.  He doesn't seem to understand that, as much as he hates spending money, the medical bills that are going to start piling up as a result of heart disease, etc., are going to far outweigh what he has to go through now to prevent that.  He also seems to have no respect for the fact that, ultimately, I am going to be the one stuck with a sick/dead S.O.  I understand that accidents happen and I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, but he is so cavalier about his health when it involves scenarios that could very likely be avoided entirely that it blows my mind.

I have explained this to him and we have the occasional arguments (overall our relationship is very strong, so this is not anything that's making or breaking it), but I just wanted to put the word out to other guys who might not understand why all women turn into raging bitches or however else they want to think of us when we try to get guys to care about their health.  Trust me, it's not because it's so much fun splashing out money on healthcare and fitness, or because we have so much free time that we'd love to spend it on the phone making medical appointments, grocery shopping/making healthier food, etc.  It's because we are capable of thinking further ahead than what's for dinner tonight, and we understand that the consequences for continuing to eat and act like a 12 year old when it comes to health will eventually be devastating to us.

If you don't have time for the long story, the above quote can simply give you what you need. The short of it is that the girl is my ex because she believed that I needed to sacrifice things to be with her, which no one should ever have to do. I'm in my office on a Friday with nothing to do, so I have no problem making this super long, but you want good advice right? Here's the long of it:

More than a year ago now, I started a relationship with this large breasted chick that was studying Kinesiology in her senior year of college. ""Beautiful and smart!"" were my initial opinions of her. I eventually was compelled to ask her out, and I did, and we went out. Somehow along the way I started a relationship from there. 

Things were happy and life was good. We were in the early stages of the relationship, where you find out all the little things about each other. I never really saw too many negatives on her, based on what she did. She pulled nice grades, was getting nice internships and shit. Played soccer and all that crap. 

So it appeared to me that she had it all, which as a guy, I will admit for a stupid reason, is somewhat pressuring, because here I am, a guy in his early 20's that just goes to school part time, works IT during the day, and smokes weed and plays video games by night. A common thought in the back of my head was that I hoped she didn't think I was any less than her.

I'm 22 years old, and live in Boston. I have my own apartment in the city and work in a nice IT job. I also play a shit ton of video games and smoke a lot of weed, (total shocker I bet) but having said that, I have a firm grasp on what my priorities are, and always make sure I can do what I can to see that my significant other is happy, which is what anyone should always try to do. I'm a decent, average guy is what I'm saying.

Let me throw out there, that it wasn't until 9 months in that she told me that she actually hates weed and video games, but I digress...

About a few months into the relationship she tells me we need to have a serious talk. She tells me that she doesn't like it when I'm high, because I don't take everything seriously, (which I can admit, she wasn't too far off there) and that I invest way to much of my time into video games that amount to nothing in real life. She said that I should do other things with my time. Perhaps cut down gaming to only on the weekends, and completely abstaining from smoking weed. Being the nice guy that I am, I do so, because I believed she was making me a better person.

I held strong for a while, finding other things to do, and things were going great again. I had recently discovered reddit at this point and one of my friends introduced me to r/atheism, which as a former catholic, was compelling and very interesting to me. 

When I brought up all this to her, telling her all the facts I read up on, asking her what she thought, she first said ""Is this really what you're thinking of doing? Because anyone that I'm with, that doesn't have faith, I can't be with.""

Now I finally stopped giving the benefit of the doubt at this point, because I truly felt bad about this situation I walked into. Here I was simply bringing up new thoughts and facts, (mind you, she is a Greek Orthodox) and she's now putting the relationship on an ultimatum. It made me think, what would happen in a world where I was with this girl for a while, we started some family, and then I tell her I am an atheist now, would she really drop everything and leave? Seemed ridiculous to me. Even more ridiculous when she said she'd actually do that.

At that point I realized I wasn't actually enjoying myself anymore. Here I was, with someone that clearly didn't like my hobbies, and didn't have the same open-mindedness as me. I had done everything I could to be a good boyfriend to her, and the person she wanted me to turn into for her, wasn't me being myself. And that is a serious issue.

I had bought into the ""sacrifice"" bullshit before, hoping I'd turn into someone that would be in a happy relationship, but I was dodging the truth that in order for someone to be happy in the relationship, they must be themselves, and be with someone who WOULDN'T change a thing. Where you can truly just exist with someone, and not care. 

This may or may not be the worst relationship article ever, and if you don't walk away with much, just understand that whoever you are, is you, and that's beautiful. Embrace it and find someone else that can do the same, and you will have a great shot of being happy in life. Don't force similarities, and always remember that Love isn't all roses.

~Ernie

UPDATE: I have plenty more stories and experience to share and dwell on, so if this goes well, I plan on doing another one of these every Friday.

I'm just a guy that wants people to know that no one has to be perfect to be happy.


UPDATE: It turns out I made the right decision. I recently started dating a girl that I've known for a while, and we really feel compatible. It's great. 

Funny thing was was once we made it official on facebook, because that somehow matters, I got a text from my ex:

""have fun with your rebound."" 

I was pretty wierded out considering I blocked her from looking at my facebook. I was also pretty dissappointed that she was stilll that attached to me. I mean, I broke up with her in May, which is several months ago from now. 

I am going to elaborate deeper on this situation in another article, becuase it's definitely one to speak of, but the main thing I took away from her outburst, is that she is just craving attention to stay relevant.  She can't stand the fact that I'm happy and better off without her, so she's getting me upset to keep herself relevant.

If you are ever being bothered by a harassing ex, just simply ignore them, no matter how pissed off they make you from the shit they say. Remember, the whole reason they are saying the things they are, is to get a rise out of you, and your only playing into their hand when you show face. Be the classier, more mature human being, and come to terms with the bullshit for what it is: bullshit, and no one wants to waste their time on bullshit.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,1344961688.0,,,True,t3_xmaqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/xmaqm/dont_be_with_someone_who_simply_cant_appreciate/,
1340823718.0,15,self.relationship_tips,vp68n,Expectations and Assumptions,24,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/vp68n/expectations_and_assumptions/,"If I could offer one piece of advice, it would be this:

Leave your assumptions at the door. Carry only the necessary expectations.

Changing just these habits has made my dating life SO much happier and healthier! I'd like to elaborate a little bit. 

Assuming basically means to think someone else is going to behave in a certain way without any indication from THEM that they will do so. For example:

-Assuming a guy/girl will return your call/text

-Assuming a guy/girl is (or isn't) interested in you

-Assuming a guy/girl will remember your birthday, your dog's name, your favorite color

-Assuming a guy/girl wants to hang out

The key here is that you think these things will happen WITHOUT INDICATION FROM THE OTHER PERSON. Never assume. Ever. Ever ever ever.

And expectation is different. An expectation is thinking that a person will do something based on an indication FROM THAT PERSON. An expectation can also be a rule you maintain to preserve your self-respect. 

*Expectations can only increase with the seriousness of the relationship.*

Examples:

-Baseline expectation: A person will avoid disrespecting me via insults, scoffing, drinking haterade. A person will follow through on what THEY say they will do. 

-Dating expectation: The guy/girl should call at 6pm IF they said they will call at 6pm. The guy/girl should pick you up for dinner at 8:30 IF they said they will pick you up at 8:30. 

-Exclusively Dating expectation: The guy/girl should stop having sex with other people IF they said they want to stop having sex with other people. The previous (dating) expectations still hold here.

-Serious Relationship expectation: The other expectations carry over, and now you have more expectations, like maybe making serious decisions together.

See how the expectations build, but NEVER turn into ASSUMPTIONS? Also note that, when you're dating, your expectations are *very* few. Expect to be treated with respect. Don't expect to be treated like a significant other.

The #1 way to avoid assumptions and make your (FEW) expectations clear is *communication*. You have every right to ask your date/partner/spouse to be specific. You have no right to be disappointed when they don't meet your ASSUMPTIONS because you haven't shared with them your EXPECTATIONS.

Hope this helps others as much as it has helped me!

My girlfriend and I are 18 and 21 respectively. We've been dating for 6 months. A couple days ago we got our marriage license and scheduled our civil ceremony at the courthouse in a month.

**The Issue**

We don't know how our parents will take it so we've chosen not to tell them. The bigger issue is keeping it a secret because marriage comes with certain legal responsibilities.

**Response to Expected Concerns**

We're too young to make such a serious commitment, it's too early in the relationship to know if we're right for each other. I know, but I'll quote something I read on MetaFilter to summarize my feelings on marriage and ""finding the right one"":

&gt;*I've been married twenty years now, after we'd known each other six weeks. I'll tell you one thing right now that I have been convinced of for all those two decades: there is no way you know him. You can wait five years, always wondering: is this going to be right? But it won't be right until you just both decide you're damn well going to make it right.*

I believe my girlfriend and I have the kind of determination and compassion, as well as other character traits and qualities, that a long-lasting, happy, and healthy marriage requires.

**What I'd like from r/relationship_tips**

If you disagree with my decision to get married young, early, and in secret then that's fine, please feel free to voice any concerns, if you're convincing enough then canceling the civil ceremony only takes a phone call. If you have something encouraging and supportive to say that'd also be appreciated. At the end of the day this is something I'm kinda set on doing, and the only thing that would stop me for sure would be a negative legal side-effect that would make my life or my soon-to-be wife's life more complicated. I'll give you a couple examples of dodged bullets.

**Filing Tax Returns**

My fiancee and I are both dependent on our parents, so naturally our parents claim us as dependents on their tax returns. At first I thought married people couldn't be claimed as dependents, but after a bit of research it turns out they can as long as both file ""married but filing separately"" returns instead of a joint return. This way our parents can file their tax returns as usual without finding out we're married and without unwittingly committing tax fraud.

**Health Insurance Coverage**

I'm a dependent on my mom's health insurance and getting married usually makes one legally independent and ineligible for dependent coverage. Luckily, our health insurance company is one of the early adopters of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and all children under the age of 26, regardless of their marital status or whether they are full-time students, are eligible dependents. I still need to call to double-check that our specific plan covers this but I'm feeling pretty confident.

**Other Possible Negative Legal Side-Effects?**

She's a girl of a upper class. She already has a few diamonds that were gifts from her parents growing up, and she will want a diamond on her ring.

I'm from a family lucky enough to have my parents pay for my college, and to repay them I hope to never ask them for another cent in my life. I make $60,000 per year on a very stable job. 

Am I supposed to follow the two month rule when buying a ring? That's $10,000. I have about $4,000 saved up. Am I supposed to take a loan for $10,000 in order to buy a ring? Stashing $1000 every month for a year doesn't seem feasible either.

I may be clueless on this venture, so show me how the hell I can plan on this in my future? I'm not ready to be married yet, but I see it coming up and want to start positioning myself correctly.

He declined, saying it was a long walk that he'd rather not make, and that I should get my sleep tonight.  This was right after I spent 3.5 hours napping with him at his place.

So I walked the 7 blocks or so in the dark back home.  Frustrated, I made a [list](http://imgur.com/IhuCi) of reasons why I should be angry and reasons why these reasons were invalid.  I then ranked each point on the don't-be-mad and the be-mad side from 1-3 based on how valid I felt each was (trying to be as objective as possible of course).  I then tallied each side, and came up with 2 almost equivalent totals.  Accounting for egotistic bias, I decided I wasn't going to be frustrated with him anymore.

I need some advice from elders who have seen more life than me. Here is brief background. I am an Indian residing in US for past 5 yrs. My career is set here and my standard of living has improved greatly. I am able to support my parents back home and my goal of coming to US has been accomplished. Now, I am in love with a girl from India. She loves me as well. We talked to our parents for marriage (Indian tradition) and her parents are not agreeing. She is a doctor pursuing masters degree in India and if she moves to US, her degree doesnt hold a value. She and her parents dont want to sacrifice her career because of me. Now I agree to this upto certain extent as well. However my career line doesn't have much scope in India and I would be back to same conditions with sea of 1 billion people competing against each other. I am the only son and in future, I would love to go back to India once I have some savings to live a good life there. Now, what I dont understand is

1) Should I sacrifice my career for her? She is not willing to do it then why should I?

2) If I do sacrifice it, she comes from a very wealthy family and me going back without much savings means there might be conflicts because of change in lifestyle for her. They are definitely more richer than my family.

3) She just called it off, saying that it is too much for any of us to sacrifice and its not fair to both of us. Now even though she did call it off, she still loves me and I love her too.

So all elders on reddit, whats your opinion on sacrificing career for love? Also, how much ""Disregard females, acquire currency"" statement is true? I am not able to sleep at night because of this BIG question. I need another opinion on this one. Please help me out. Thanks.

**Over-thinking**  
Everyone does this. I do it. But you need to realize this: The longer you think about ""Should I ask her out?"" ""What if..."" ""I don't know..."", the more unlikely you are going to take action on anything.

Inaction is NOT what you want. You will never learn anything by not doing anything (except maybe your SO/potential SO getting pissed about you not doing anything).

Trust your first instinct and go for it. If you fail, oh well. You learned from this experience, and at the very least, you tried! That's what matters! The more actions you take, the more confident you will feel about doing more. You won't think about failing; you'll start thinking ""Whatever. She's missing out. NEXT!"" or ""Ok, I need to adjust this for next time."" THIS is the mindset you need.

**TALK!**  
You have something on your mind that has been bugging you about your SO. She's been drinking too much. He's ignoring you for WoW. You feel it's unfair that you're making all the effort in the relationship.

Instead of talking to your friends about it (or worse, sitting there quietly and over-thinking it) and start loathing and hating, talk to your SO instead! More often than not, they are not aware of what's going on or what your feelings are. Remember...they can't read your mind. You can't be passive-aggressive about these things.

He wanted me to go out of town to see friends with him in his old college town this weekend, I couldn't go because I had prior familial obligations. He seemed okay with that, though was sad that I wasn't coming, and mentioned that it was okay since if I wasn't going he would catch up with friends and ""get that pillow back to [female friend]"".  

I asked who she was, and he quite honestly explained that she was a girl that he used to like. He said that he stopped hanging out with her at first because it seemed like she wasn't interested, yet they started hanging out again a while later for a period of time, and he explained that this time he stopped hanging out with her because she seemed to just ask a lot of favors from him without returning his interest still.

He lost contact with her shortly before we ran into eachother and started dating. 

I guess at one point she slept over his house and left a pillow there before we were dating, and he's held onto it. He told me that she had texted him the other day and told him that she wanted to ""hang out with him this summer."" He reasons that she just wants the pillow.

He explained their interaction as him always instigating hangouts, and her never instigating.

When I asked why he wanted to hang out with her again, he said that he thinks he could end up being ""really good friends"" with her.

I'm upset and I don't know how to handle this correctly. I'm not comfortable with telling him who he can and can't hang out with, but I don't like how this feels at all. 

I talked to him about it last night and he said he wont do anything that would make me uncomfortable, and ""I'll let you know if it gets out of hand"". He says it's nothing to worry about, and I'm trying not to worry, but I'm worrying. I am worrying like crazy.

I am miserable with myself because of this worrying. I hate hate hate the idea of ever controlling him, or making him unable to spend time with a good friend- but she doesn't sound like a good friend- I asked if she was, he said she was always aloof and difficult to get ahold of, and she was always trying to get more favors out of him.

We hang out really frequently, but he gets plenty of ""bro time"" as he likes to call it.  His friends are really chill, and we all like hanging out together.  Most of my friends are away since it is our summer vacation from college, but most of his close friends live in town.  He always seems to be having a better time when he's with his friends, which really puts me down sometimes.

He didn't come and see me until he came to bed, and even then he was just outright unfriendly to me.  

It seems every time we begin to hang out, I am really optimistic and happy, try to brighten his day and encourage him to have fun and enjoy whatever we're doing.  A cycle has begun where every time we hang out (it feels like), I start off cheery and sweet, he is on rare occasion also cheery, he comes over, we hang out, he ends up talking down to me/telling me that I'm doing this wrong/insinuating that I make shit choices/complaining, and I get into a crappy mood eventually.  After I get sour, he cheers up and tells me to ""be happy"" and ""stop being so grumpy"".  Something will cheer me up (usually my pets being adorable) and as soon as I enter a good mood, he backs right into being a grouch again.  It feels like neither of us can be happy at the same time.  

I don't know how to talk to him about this.  He is a very stubborn guy, and refuses to see anything wrong in what he does unless I'm crying or having a panic attack, THEN he feels bad and awful to an extreme.  Is that even normal?!  I don't want to have to break down for him to see that something's not right.  Please help me, boyfriends and girlfriends of Reddit.  I need some advice.

Me(25) and my girl(25) have been together for over six years, we are madly in love. 2013 is our year, everything we have worked so hard for (house, jobs, etc) have come to fruition. In my head there is no other year better than this for me to ask her to marry me (mind you I have read other posts and yes we have discussed marriage before, she will not be surprised). Anyway we are going on a cruise later in the year and originally was thinking i would do it on the ship. Then the other day she was drinking with her friend at my place of work and my boss mentions how (my girls) uncle proposed to his wife on a cruise ship to her (greeaat). Now I dont hear this original conversation (for all I know it didnt even happen, but she wouldn't normally make something up). Now while driving her home she mentions her uncles cruise proposal to me, and how my boss brought it up. Now here is the big question: did she say that because she wants me to do it on the ship, or because she doesn't?? Now that she has said it aloud, it kind of kills it for me, but if she wants me to do it on the boat i will. If you think she doesnt please say so and let me run my alternative proposal method by you women and you can let me know of its romantic-ness haha.

Thanks everybody ahead of time for help, afraid to ask any girls around me in fear of them being unable to hide it emotionally. We have a pretty small circle and i could never risk it so i turn to reddit! (even though i have tons of friends on here as well, hence the throwaway) Told this was not good enough for /r/askwomen, and not specific enough for/r/relationships so here i am, try 3. please! input appreciated

My boyfriend [25/m] and I [22/f] have been dating for about a year now. None of us have said ""I love you"" to each other and sometimes we get into these disagreements or debates about topics that get so heated, I stop talking or he gets upset and it ruins the night. Sometimes when he talks about certain things, I have no interest in, I just nod or I listen (I'm a good listener) but I'm lost for words, so I just say ""ok or oh cool"" but I don't contribute anything the conversation because I really don't know much about it. He does the same when topics I talk about don't interest him. 

There have been times where our conversations had awkward silences in restaurants or I was too quiet for him because I didn't have anything really interesting to say, that I got up to go to the bathroom, cried a little, and tried to calm down before I headed back to the table for dinner. 

I really wanted this to work but I think we're falling out of love for each other. Dinner conversations can sometimes be forced. I usually talk about school or science stuff or interesting people in my life because that's all I do everyday while he never really talks about what he does because his job is a dead end job and he just watches tv or something but sometimes he contributes interesting questions or ideas. 

Lately, I tried to get him to watch something that I LOVE and I want to share it with him but he has a stereotypical view of what it consists of and he's being soo narrow minded about it. So now I'm just sooo pissed. 

All these incompatibilities aside, he's a really nice guy. He's almost perfect (romantic, caring, funny) but he can be a jerk sometimes when it comes to my hobbies and interests. 

Does this just mean we're not compatible, that I should break up with him and that I should find someone else? 

I guess I'm just so worried that if I break up with him and the new person I'm with is lousy, mean, psychotic or abusive.... I will regret breaking up with this new guy. 

tl;dr: My boyfriend [25/m] and I [22/f] (Dating for a year) are running out of things to say to each other over dinner. To a point where I'm crying that what I say is either rejected or stupid enough for me not to say anything. We are almost complete opposites in hobbies and interests. Should I break up with him or not?

I'm going to try to keep this short while still providing adequate information.

Her and I have been together for a little over two and a half years now. We started going out in high school, and continued in a long distance relationship when she moved hundreds of miles away from home for school (it's far enough that trips cost several hundred dollars). Everything was alright for the first two semesters, but got a little rocky over summer of 2012 due to me becoming very depressed for unrelated reasons. This caused us to lose a lot of our communication. This past fall was very rough for me. After I was able to snap out of my depression, she was very angry. We almost didn't make it, but we both agreed we wanted to try and that it was worth it. She came home for winter break and everything got a lot better during that month of contact.

Recently, I've kind of started to come to terms with my feelings regarding all this, and I could really use some advice. I feel like I'm not very important in her life anymore. She has told me multiple times that school is, and will always be, more important to her than me, to the point that she wouldn't really hesitate to end us if our relationship somehow got in the way of school. I get this, school is very important, but that still hurts a lot to hear.

Just last night, I brought up a concern I was having, and, instead of trying to get to the bottom of why I was having that concern, she just kept saying it was “ridiculous” and when I would continue explaining, she would exclaim “wow” or “really”. She just sat there shooting my concerns down over and over, and getting angrier and angrier.
I genuinely don’t feel like we’re a couple sometimes. I feel like I’m her friend, and not a good one at that sometimes. It’s always her way or the highway. “Oh you’re having some issues you could really use a supportive girlfriend to help you through? Well *if and only if* I have time after my homework, and you better not DARE say anything otherwise or I’ll get incredibly mad at you and pretty much hold a grudge.”

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared of talking to her because it seems to always end with her mad at me. This doesn’t mean I don’t try to talk to her. I try a lot. I just go into it with a massive knot of fear in my stomach.

Whenever I ask, she always says she wants us to continue and doesn’t want it to end, and that she wants to try, to make it work, but she doesn’t seem to put in the effort to try half the time. I bring this up and she starts listing things that she does do, and my argument that “I appreciate that very much, but the two things I do ask for, you don’t do” isn’t valid to her. Essentially, I get the “I’ve done all this other stuff. You need to be grateful.” feeling from her.

I’m considering moving out to be with her in several months, but I just don’t know. I know we’ve grown apart, but I don’t think that has to mean the end. I just don’t know if she’s going to actually put in the effort with me to rekindle everything. If I criticize anything that is even remotely connected to school (hint: most everything in her life), I’m all of a sudden a huge bad guy, and anything I say has no more meaning. When we talk about me moving, she said ""I'm just concerned"". When I press the issue, she just says ""I dunno, I just am."" She's such an indecisive person, I feel like I make a lot of the decisions, and oh boy, if I make the wrong one...

I have no clue what happened. She is such an angry/pessimistic person nowadays. She never used to be. She does have some severe depression issues, but I’ve always known this and have always been there in any way to help if she needed it.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I don't mean much to her anymore and she pretty much scoffs at me when I suggest this. She got very blunt and cold in her style of texting last fall, which threw me for a loop because she has always been very, very lovey over all media of communication. Calling me our nicknames, randomly saying ""I love you"" or ""I miss you"", doing things like making arts and crafts and sending them to me on a whim. She pretty much stopped last fall, and like I said, it caused an issue.

She's gotten a lot better since she went back after winter break, but she just recently told me she has to make a conscious effort to do it. Really? You have to make a conscious effort to tell me you love me? Maybe I'm completely wrong, but that seems like it should be something that comes naturally. It does for me.

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend and I are getting ever more distant. I feel like she doesn't completely care about me anymore due to various reasons. I'm considering moving to be with her in the hopes that it'll help us rekindle our relationship, but I'm very scared of that.

I have been with this amazing man for 6 years. We have been together through thick and thin, health scares, family issues, landlord grievances and the frustrations of being full time college students and full time workers. We have had disagreements but never really fought. We do everything together and have our own seperate hobbies we do on our own. It's wonderful. We love everything about one another and support each other in everything we do and it has been 6 years. We have discussed ""going further"" but nothing has happened. I remeber him telling me that some statistic percentage of marraiges end in divorce; I told him that we've lasted longer than most relationships. He told me that the church or the state should have absolutely no hand in saying who is or who is not together and we are togther because he loves me; I proposed then, that we handfast with both our families present and that would be our ""marriage"". He told me a ring is too expensive; I told him that there was a vending machine at the grocery store that had rings for a quarter. He said there are ""expectations"" in a marriage; I told him I would make the sandwiches then and keep his playing cards organized. 

I am not questing his love for me. He has never given me reason to doubt it and he wants to remain with me and he said so. I beleive him. It's been 6 years. Maybe this is a man thing, I don't know.

1360122636.0,14,self.relationship_tips,17z99y,Her Past.,20,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/17z99y/her_past/,"I know this is a pretty popular topic on here, where guys will ask how to deal with it and such. I just wanted to give my 2 cents, if that's alright folks. 

When you dwell on her past, you begin to really look at only that. You practically get tunnel vision and ask why you can't move on. And if you were like me, when you'd get curious about a detail, you'd ask, knowing the answer might upset you. 

I have a beautiful girlfriend, she's sweet, caring, absolutely lovely. But when I was having issues with her past, I didn't see that. I saw her as dirty. Of course I cared for her a lot then, but I still saw her in a negative light in this respect. And you've all heard it, ""all you need to do is look at the good stuff"". It sounds so generic, right? Like, okay, I've done that, it's still there. You probably even visualize, whether on purpose or not, details of the past she had told you about after you asked, and it makes you so angry, as if there's a fire in your heart. This is probably how it's been so far. At least that's how it was for me. 

It almost felt like a struggle to be in that relationship. I don't know why I felt like that. I wasn't insecure. I still dwelled on it though, and it kept hurting. 

And then I realized something. This is going to sound cheesy as fuck by the way, but bear with me:

I love her. I love who she is. I find her personality, her character, her mind, all of her, completely intriguing. I consider myself an introvert, but when I'm with her, that usual need of time alone just isn't there. So why the fuck was I fretting about her past? Her past (and by her past I mean her complete past, not just the small percentage of her past that you seem to be stuck on) is what made her who she is today. She has experienced things, lived and learned, and is amazing today, so why am I torturing myself? 

So after constant nagging and finding things out, I came to understand that her past, was well, *hers*. I have no business there. 

You say the images pop up, but trust me, once you stop thinking about it and dwelling on it, they don't. Your curiosity about her past isn't going to stop by the way. No matter how much you find out, you'll want to know more, fully knowing it will hurt you. It's kind of like your curiosity about the drama that was happening in high school, you're just being nosey at this point and have nothing to gain except juicy drama -- with the exception with that in this case, those details will fuck you over later because you'll keep dwelling on the past. 

PS. Your imagination is going to run wild with the details. When you imagine that shit, you're going to imagine it 500x better than it actually was. Scumbag brain if you will, but whatever is the most familiar experience you have with sex is probably what you're going to associate the details (I.E. imagination is going to run wild with porn-esque visualizations of the details). 

If her past ever ""pops"" up, I simply start thinking of her, and within my mind's eye, there is literally a hand pushing the past to the side and I see her smile. Might sound counterintuitive, but I know she is mine now. I know her present is me, and I love her to the point where thinking of her destroys any of those thoughts regarding her past. 

PSS. Stop fucking thinking about the specifics you asked for. You need to think generally. I don't know about the next guy, but I don't think I'll ever be completely comfortable with the thought of my SO having sex with a guy. Because of this, the way I stopped the details from coming up is I don't think ""[insert detail I idiotically asked about]"", I think ""her past."" Period. What I mean is keep it civil you perverted fuck. 

For example, if she brings up that one time she had a blast with that one friend you know she hooked up with, you don't start thinking about the details and imagine him fucking her. That's how you fall into the hole you're in right now. You think, ""oh, so and so she has a past with"" AT MOST. Hell, it'd be even better if you stop making that association at all, and when she tells that story, you just think of him as her friend that she went with. To summarize the pps, if you feel that urge to think of her past, at least save your self anguish and your relationship by thinking generally. Don't fucking think specifics. 

**tl;dr direct your attention on her, don't dwell on the past, keep everything general, and realize your curiosity is going to royally fuck you if you keep asking questions about this shit as if it was some high school drama.**

We are not living together. His mother does not think it is wise for us to live together (we've both been living with roommate, separately) so that is out of the question.

Every time he leaves, it's annoying. Not to mention we live in an expensive area, so it would be economical to live together. While his parents can afford for him to live where he wants, I'm on a tight budget with my parents. But apparently, that's not allowed because his parents won't allow it.

Neither of us are planning on getting engaged or married any time soon, I think I'd like to wait until at least my late twenties.

I guess the bottom line is that I'm bored and I'm questioning our levels of commitment. I don't know if I'm being too forward because I want to move in together and want to figure stuff out.

I've been best friends with the girl since high school and when we moved in together about 6 months ago and were looking for a third she suggested this guy, a friend of hers. I didn't know him at all but over the last 6 months we've lived together we've become pretty good friends.

Alice is out of town for the weekend, and last night I was at home alone reading. Doug came home mid evening and to my surprise he had been crying, like tears, streaks on his face. He immediately went to his room. I was a little weirded out, I can't remember the last time I saw a grown man cry. After a bit indecision I knocked on the door and when I didn't get an answer followed him in.

His room was dark and he was wrapped up on his bed audibly sobbing. I asked if he wanted to talk, and he wasn't that responsive so I sat down on the edge of his bed, just sort of was there. after a little while opened up;

He's been on a first date last night, I guess he'd met someone online. He taken her out to a nice restaurant, with intention of doing something after that. He thought everything was going great until she mid-meal told him she was going to the washroom and never came back. No ""I'm sorry I have to go"", just disappeared.

He was there go about 30 minutes after that, and described it as the most humiliating moment of his life when it realized she wasn't returning. The way he talked about it, it sounded so horrible. Him sitting alone in the middle of a busy restaurant, staring at her half eaten meal, while the waiter kept checking in. Then paying for both meals and driving home.

I tried to be comforting, talk about what a horrendous bitch she is, tell him is wasn't the worst thing ever, that he'd recover,that there were lots of other girls. I didn't really feel like I was helping. He started to tell me how lonely he was. He told me he was, at 25, still a virgin, had never had a girlfriend! I didn't know how to react to that, but apparently shock wasn't right. :(

When he said ""I'm just *so sick* of being alone"", it was the saddest most pathetic thing I'd ever heard. I tried to tell him he's not alone, that he has me and Alice, but I know that's not what he meant. I didn't know what to do, but I just sort of rubbed his back while he cried, and eventually left him alone.

**TL;DR** Roommate got abandoned on a date and just sort of broke. I want to help cheer him up, but I've got no experience cheering up someone who isn't a girl or boyfriend. I wanted to just get in bed an hold him but thought that would be inappropriate. How do I help a guy friend feel less lonely?

1343793189.0,14,self.relationship_tips,xhl3d,"Redditors, where do you draw the line between emotional maturity and total detachment?",16,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/xhl3d/redditors_where_do_you_draw_the_line_between/,"Me: 19 Him: 21. We dated for 11 months and broke up recently because we were consistently having the same fight, with no solution in sight. I felt he got pretty detached and wasn't engaged in the relationship, and he felt he was giving everything and I was being unreasonably needy.

It was my first serious relationship, so I have very little perspective on this and I welcome yours. I'm kind of a doormat and I will readily admit to being pretty bad at expressing my needs. After we got into fights about things and I finally said 'this is something I need to happen' (the big ones I can remember: cuddling, picking me up instead of me taking the bus or walking to his apartment when we lived 2 miles apart, coming to my concerts, and talking most nights when we weren't in the same town), he was pretty consistent about doing most of them.

The problem is, if I didn't overtly express something specific, he would do very very little for the relationship. When I did express something specific, he did that--and only that. He was great at not doing bad things for the relationship like judging me or pressuring me (intentionally anyway), but at doing proactive things like complimenting me or telling me he loved me or any sweet things like that, it just didn't happen on its own. I had to ask for it every time.

When we got into fights I would find myself saying ""I just need you to show me you care more, because I'm getting the message that you don't."" His response was that that's just not who he is and he shouldn't have to prove his love to me.

The way he sees it, his sacrifices were letting me come over and hanging out with him. I always felt that was a little unfair because I packed my bag every night and took the bus to class the next morning so that I could spend time with him, and I was always the one texting him asking to come over or to talk to him if I wasn't staying over that night. If I didn't text him, I wouldn't talk to him for two or three days until he texted me, which I hated. However, there was no way for me to say that without feeling ashamed of my needs, so the fight always ended with me agreeing that I needed to be less needy and that I would work on it.

I tried to get better at expressing my needs, with mixed results. For example, towards the end of our relationship, I asked if he wanted to come over to my house (he works closer to my house than his, actually) during his three hour lunch break and I could make him lunch and we could hang out, so that I could see him more than just once or twice on the weekends (he works long hours and goes home exhausted every night). He said he just needed that time to relax and didn't want to come over. When I said I was kind of upset about that, he said that was unreasonable to expect. That was our last big fight and then we broke up that week.

I don't want you to think I just took his sacrifices for granted or something. I learned a little about the ""5 ways people show love"" and I looked for all of them, and I really didn't find any. He is such a sweet, honest guy and I don't doubt that he meant well, he just never expressed his love. After we broke up he actually said some heartbreakingly emotional loveydovey things, that he had never mentioned during the relationship. As far as I can tell, he actually feels like the victim in this relationship because he was getting the message that he wasn't good enough.

TL;DR nice guy who got very detached and put little effort into the relationship, or clingy girl who expected too much?

I'm interested in knowing where you draw the line between showing people you care about them and not being overly needy. I also understand expressing your needs and not expecting your SO to read your mind, but is there a baseline to be expected of being engaged in the relationship? I got tired of asking for everything if I wanted any input at all from him.

How should I react?,18,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/xe8l5/my_husband_is_giving_me_the_most_childish/,"A little background. I am 27, he is 40. We have been married one month but dated for 3 years. Over the weekend an argument resurfaced about an incident that had occurred the week before that we had never discussed. He had gone out to a bar for awhile (no big deal), but instead of coming home at 9 like he had told me, he didn't come home until 2:30 am. During that time he wouldn't answer my calls or check in with me AT ALL. I was genuinely concerned about him. 

Fast forward to current argument, I ask him not to do that again it was inconsiderate, and announce that looking forward when we have kids I don't think that is appropriate behavior, you just don't act that way when you have family. He responds by abruptly dissapearing that day around noon, and didn't come home until 4 in the morning. He called me once at 9pm drunkenly  asking ""how are you"" and I asked him where he was, to which he wouldn't answer. I guess he was trying to make his point? He avoided me all morning before leaving for work. 

How do you respond to such antics? He is ridiculous.

**It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken**: Again, written toward women, but it's good for anyone going through a breakup/separation/divorce. Also really good for people who are considering reconciliation. 

**The Five Love Languages**: This is for men or women. It's written with a marriage spin, but can be used at any point. There is a version for singles. It's a great tool for increasing communication and learning about yourself and your partner. 

**The Tao of Dating**: There are versions for men and women. This is written toward 'working professionals' but can be used for anyone, single or dating. It is a book for people who are looking for fulfillment--*not* from another person. (*I also really enjoyed **The Tao of Pooh** *for an introduction to Taoism.*)

It's often coupled with one form of abuse or another.

Just because you love a person gives no indication of how they feel about you. If you are looking at relationship problems, set aside the fact that you love them and look at the problem from a distance.

Now, I'm not saying that if you love someone, they *can't* love you. Far from it. But when there are signs that they are abusing you, or just don't give a damn about the relationship, ignore ""what your heart is telling you"" and look at it with fresh eyes. Take the advice of friends that will give it to you straight. 

Does he make you important in his life? Is she trying to hide where she's going every weekend? Does he tell you you're worthless to anyone but him, and you should be grateful he keeps you around? Does she sweeten up only when she wants you to buy something for her? **These are bad.**

Are you arguing over who's going to take out the trash? Is she stressed over school finals? Is he playing video games a little too much? **These are things that can be worked through.** Notice the difference between being used and taken for granted, and simple things that can be resolved with communication.

If someone is using or abusing you, it's common to feel like you're in love. Otherwise you probably wouldn't put up with their shit, to be honest. But that's exactly why you need to stop saying things like, ""I really love him and I want to work this out..."" and consider: Would you let a friend do this to you? Or a complete stranger?

If you're ever unsure about whether you're in an abusive situation, chances are, you're in one. But look up the signs. Don't stay around just because you love them and hope they'll change.

Spent most days or night together, and 9 months in moved in together. Since then we've been together basically every day, and share the same pool of friends. We both have good jobs, but hers is something she sort of just fell into. 

Last summer, she started getting really sad/anxious all the time. We had fallen into a routine for sure. I tried to help her, but she just kept pushing me away. I had a really hard time telling her when i was unhappy because of the way she was, because I didn't want to make anything worse. For months i felt like i was tiptoeing around, just trying to not make her/us worse. That really got to me and i withdrew. 

Next thing we knew, while we could act like great friends all the time, we had no romantic relationship, because she was too depressed/anxious to want anything romantic when i would try, which wasn't often because i felt so rejected. Finally this late winter, we decided to spend some time apart, so i left to stay at my friends place. We talked every day, but were getting no where.

 I've done plenty of thinking and feel like I've changed and can bring real change and improvement back to our relationship and how i communicate my feelings, good or bad, to her. I feel like i have a new perspective on our relationship and how much it means to me. I get the feeling she still doesn't know what she wants, and that it wasn't our relationship that made her unhappy, but the other way around, that it fell apart because we both let it, because she wouldn't let me help her, and once i stopped she felt (rightly so) like i gave up. Now I feel like she was so unhappy, something needed to change, and it was easier to make it be us than to fix the root cause (which affected us). 

I've started compiling a list of  topics to cover when we talk(soon), to keep myself organized. To talk about me and mistakes I've made, and ways i feel like I've changed. To talk about her and how she has made me feel, how i feel like she has given up on fixing our relationship because it would be hard, and because she can't be sure it would work out in the end. Get very specific about my feeling for her and how much our entire relationship has meant to me, which i never properly expressed before. To talk about how we promised to love each other in good times and bad, and this is really the first bad time we've had, and we can't just give up on it. And finally to ask her straight out if she still loves me and if she wants to fix things (not if she thinks we can, but if she even wants to try). 

Does this approach seem reasonable? I feel like I'm really going to put it all on the line telling her how i feel and changes I want to make, and to ask her to tell me what she wants specifically. Any advice from anyone who has gone through being separated and wanting to work things out? If one party wanted to , and the other wasn't sure you could work it out, how did you get them to at least try?

Looking for advice on splitting finances (rent/mortgage, groceries) [xposted from r/relationships]",14,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/18f7fb/boyfriend_m_26_of_1_year_is_buying_a_home_im_f_24/,"Was told to put this here instead of r/relationships

I'm very excited to be moving in with my boyfriend [of 1 year] later this year.  I also teach guitar lessons out of my home, so it's important to have a suitable and semipermanent location to have students come to.  

He's buying a triplex in the summer; he and I will be living in one unit (a 2 bedroom) together, and he'll rent out the others to tenants.  I'll be paying him rent - or helping with his mortgage, depending on how you look at it, and we'll of course be sharing the expenses of food and utilities.  

I have no doubts about our readiness as a couple for this step (I've essentially moved in with him already, highly compatible, similar schedules and eating habits, discussed it at great length, yadda yadda), but I'm a bit concerned about financial issues that may come up with dating my landlord!  We are great communicators; we've talked a lot already about the move and touched on these financial details, but I just want some suggestions on what to bring to the more in depth conversations. 

I would really love to hear how other couples in similar situations have gone about:

1.  Groceries - he eats way more than me, but we eat a lot of the same stuff.  Him = 3 square meals/day.  Me = light midday snack, then cooking dinner with him and eating 2/3 as much - he takes the leftovers to work.  How to split the bill fairly without being too stingy and/or having his and hers cabinets?

2.  With the mortgage he's getting and average rent prices in the area, he's expecting that the rent from the other tenants will nearly cover his entire monthly mortgage payments.  (I realize there are other scenarios where he can't get that much, or it's empty for a few months, but he is pretty well researched and already rents out two other properties.)  Heat, water, electricity - these make perfect sense to split evenly.  But rent?  On one hand I don't expect to live for free, or even for really cheap.  On the other I don't want to just be pumping 1/3 of my paycheck into his future investment while he doesn't even pay 'rent.'   Should I just plan on paying average rent prices, or is it reasonable to ask to contribute less?

3.  He makes about 2x as much as me, not counting some income from other renters.  I'm comfortable, but need to be a bit frugal.  He works full time, I have a part time job and am a student.  Is it even fair of me to consider this in any of our decision making?  

4.   Any other big concerns I should consider?  I think we can figure out the chores and cooking, and I'll be sure not to go halvsies on any furniture we need. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend is buying a triplex and I'm moving in.  He makes more money and eats more food than me.  Other tenants will cover most of his mortgage, how much do I pay in rent?  How do we split groceries?

It was my first physical relationship and she has had two relationships of one year each before. She wanted a casual relationship while I was developing feelings for her, and so we decided to end it before I got hurt. Now we talk as friends. ""Fortunately"" we didn't have sex (I'm a virgin and I fear my feelings for her would've increased too much if I lost it with her).

Seeing that I'll attend college next year, I've been reading articles about casual relationships, and damn, I really get depressed over them. I just can't see myself having sex or just being intimate with someone without strings or feelings attached. I feel that I'm kind of old fashioned (mainly because I've been ""raised by TV"" and its romantics principles), and that maybe I'm wrong at my way of seeing things, but I've always desired the lovey dovey kind of love. But, reading all the cheating stories of married couples on this subreddit, really strikes me with fear. Seriously what the fuck, I don't want that shit to happen to me, but that's another story.

Is it really too much to ask for a stable and serious relationship nowadays? I want to find my, what much of you call, SO. I really can't wrap my head around the term FWB or casual dating, it just hurts me.
Just to clarify, I'm not religious or anything like that, it's just that I don't get it and I feel like casual dating isn't compatible with my values. I've been thinking of leading a lonely life unless I find who really is my soulmate, because anything else doesn't seem to be worth it.

Been living together now for over a year. (Known each other for much longer)

Found careers together. (Separate fields, we don't work together, we just helped each other find a path we enjoy.)

We've both traveled a lot before we knew each other.

Age isn't an issue. The relationship isn't an issue. I see myself with her forever.

The issue is the proposal!

She has been asking for well over 6 months now for a Pomeranian puppy. Our apartment isn't pet friendly, so I made her agree to wait until we move. We will be moving Feb 1st, 2013.

We went and looked at puppies. She fell in love with this one little black fur ball. 
 
She will be out of town for a week during the move. I'm moving the stuff by myself. So I convinced her that I can't watch a new puppy and move the house, plus it wouldn't be fair to a dog in training to have to switch environments. She agreed. We will wait till the next litter.

So I called the breeder and told her my plan: I will still buy the puppy, I will still move apartments by myself. Then I can pick her up at the airport with the dog in my arms. 

Now comes my real set of dilemmas.. I'm going to ask her to marry me at the airport. I'm not sure how.

Do I get a name tag that reads ""Will you marry me?""

Do I put a ring on the dog collar? Is a silver band acceptable so she can pick one out herself if she wants? I can't just ask her though.. it will raise suspicion. 

Is this a good idea at all? Should I wait until she is home? Usually I know what to do when it comes to her, we're best friends. But I don't know if my logics are working right now and my emotions are getting the best of me. Every idea I come up with has my brain going ""ITS GOLD. DO IT.""

How do I talk to my boyfriend about having a threesome?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months now (though we were best friends for over a year) and we're madly in love. We talk about getting married and having kids and growing old together and all that gooey romance stuff. He's the love of my life and the sex is earth-shattering.... buuut I think it would be kind of hot to add another woman to the bedroom to spice things up.

I don't know if I'm considered bisexual as I don't feel emotionally attracted to women ( i.e. I don't ever see myself falling ""in love"" with a women), but dear god does a naked women get me wet! 

I love having sex women, and would LOVE to have a threesome with my boyfriend and a beautiful woman. Only problem is- my boyfriend has told me in the past (before we were dating) that he could never see himself having a threesome with someone he's in a loving relationship with because thinks he would feel like a cheater.

How do I approach this situation? I'm really embarrassed/nervous to ask him for a threesome because I think he may feel my desires mean I don't truly love him. I would never push him to do something he didn't want to, but i've never asked him before, and I feel like I should be able to talk to him about this desire.

Optional backstory: We have been together for over a year, and I love him more than I have ever loved anyone. He is gentle, caring, and honest. I however, am still scared of that changing. I don't know what it is, but I constantly have dreams that he leaves me or cheats on me like right in front of me, and weird shit like that. 

I think I have these dreams because I love him so much. I used to have dreams similar to these about my mother leaving me when I was little. (She too is an honest caring person that would never do such a thing and never has.) I guess I'm just being worried/keeping my guard up in a weird way?

Still, I just can't shake the thought of him having some weird separate life behind my back. Maybe cheating, maybe just emotional cheating, I don't know!

I was introduced to this guy through a mutual friend just over a month ago, and we hit it off. She (the mutual friend) invited me and another girl friend to go out on his boat, and we had so much fun.
Ever since then, we've been hanging out, partying, going out on his boat, and just having a good time together.
I got the gist of his situation almost immediately - his divorced finalized earlier this year, but they were separated for almost two years now. They have a 9 year old son together. She's cheated on him with multiple men for the majority of their marriage, and is already remarried to one of them.
He's hurting, definitely nowhere near over the whole thing. He's got a lot of anger towards her and that guy, and all the other guys who she cheated with on him.
On top of that, he is having a hard time dealing with his son having a step dad in his life, and only has visitation every two weekends.
I think that's why he parties so much...I mean, he drinks a lot. He drank at the bar before we left on that 7 hour road trip to the lake.

As soon as we got to the lake at sunrise, we cracked a beer, and I asked him how his labor day was with his son...and he told me how he'd gone to his ex-wife's family party to see him and all his other ex-inlaws, and how hard it was for him to see her with another guy, and how he learned of two more cheating episodes he didn't know about. They'd had alot of memories at the very lake we were at, and it was going to be hard for him to be there again.

My heart breaks for him, it really does. But that's how we started our little vacation together...me looking forward to having fun with him, and them boom, he basically tells me he's not over his ex's drama as much as he thought he was. 

It just ruined my whole trip. I couldn't be myself, I couldn't act the way I wanted to. That whole conversation weighed on me the entire time, and I was near tears by the time we were ready to go.
I knew he didn't want a serious relationship - he'd told me this before, which was another incident of awful timing - just after sex. 

I know it's probably going to take him at least a couple years to be in anyway emotionally ready to have intimacy with a woman again, and I'm clinging onto nothing, really, but false hopes that he'll see what a great girl he has right in front of him.
All he talks about is horror stories of his ex - even while camping at the lake with 12 other people - it was embarrassing for me to sit by him while all he talked about was her, instead of trying to just enjoy the time we had all there together.

I am pent up and uncomfortable, because I can't be myself with him, which is touchy and affectionate and sweet and kind and nurturing. I can almost feel the wall he has up against being in anyway emotionally close to me. It's not happening.
Then he reaches out and shows me a moment of tenderness, and I feel relief and relaxed for a few minutes. But it's fleeting.

I'm starting to get my feelings hurt, and I know I can't go anywhere meaningful with him. I really wish he wasn't so concerned about what his cheater ex-wife is doing these days, and just enjoy spending time with me, but I kind of understand how these things take time to heal.
 
I just don't think it's worth my emotional effort to be around him anymore, because I can't deal with his unavailability. I play it off like I'm just down to have fun, but really I do crave a connection, a bond, with someone, that we can enjoy together, and I just can't have that with him. I don't know what else I want to get out of this, but to get it off my chest, that it hurts. 


UPDATE: He only texted me once in a week after the trip, and I found out that he went to hang out with the skank he was seeing before me (who was with two other of my girl friends, who told me, of course) and the guy had the nerve to tell one the girls that he wasn't that into me, and didn't know how to tell me, and felt bad.

Well, that is if you notice that everything is being argued about, even trivial matters and on a constant level. Let us tackle some of the things that you need to pay attention to when it comes to arguing.

First, what is being argued about? There are things that are usual causes of an argument like money, jealousy and discipline. Money can be a source of disagreement because our spending habit may not be the same as our partner. You may think that your partner is spending too much your hard earned money and the situation may get out of hand. However, if you are married, keep in mind that the money that you are earning is for your family, including your wife, so technically, it is both yours. Having said that, he or she is entitled to spend that money of yours. The best way to resolve this issue is to talk it over and create a family budget that you will both agree upon. So, arguments about money will only be too much if, after creating and sticking to your budget, you still have disagreements over it.

What about jealousy? It is normal to ask for your partners’ exclusive devotion because after all, you have committed faithfulness to each other. But arguments about jealousy will be too much if every little thing will be an issue. So, you have to make sure that the reason for jealousy is reasonable and not recurring. If you have resolved an issue before, make sure that you no longer brought that up later on.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_qnn9m,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/qnn9m/how_much_arguing_is_too_much_in_a_relationship/,

I've had a few casual relationships with women but they always turned out badly. Many just never went anywhere. One girl ignored me for a whole year because I cried in front of her. 

My best friend Katie was my first real love. She was the one to suggest a more intimate relationship, even though she had always identified herself as heterosexual. I was so happy. Unfortunately, she was not. Being confused about her sexuality led her to become extremely paranoid and distant. We would only hold hands when no one was watching, or tucked behind her purse in the back seat of the car. The occasional kiss she allowed me was awkward and hurried. When I said I loved her, she would simply smile or nod. I was happy, she was not, and I was too blinded by my own feelings to see this.

This continued for about a year. I saw less and less of her. Fortunately, I was able to attend an art seminar with her over the summer. One night she called me and told me we needed to talk. the next morning she finally sat down with me and told me it was off. How unhappy and stressed being with me made her. How self-conscious she felt. ""I'm supposed to be the feminine one. Next to you...I just don't feel pretty anymore."" I was crushed and speechless. She patted me on the shoulder saying we were still friends. She and I then went to the art seminar. 

I had to spend the whole day with her just a few yards from me. Finally, not able to take it anymore, I excused myself from the class and left the building. Next thing I knew I was punching brick wall and trees. Ramming my head against any hard surface I could find. Crying hysterically, I wandered around for almost 3 hours. My hands were bruised and bloody. I'm an artist, my hands are precious, my love is precious, they both must go. I lied my way into obtaining work gloves and made my way back to the class building. Katie was there, standing  outside. Avoiding her questions I went to the nearest phone to get picked up.

Everything spiraled out of control for me at that point. I stayed in bed for a month. Senior year came around and I could barely keep up with my friends there. One morning, Katie finally called for the first time since the incident. Her 12 year old brother had died of a seizure the previous night. He was severely autistic, unable to speak or do anything for himself. Katie had always been unable to see me because she was constantly taking care of him. I always wished he was never there, and then he suddenly was gone. It left me numb. My own brother had aspergers. What if I lost him too? I was invited over after his funeral to stay the night. I held Katie all night as she cried.

My aunt's cat died too, shortly after. I loved that cat. I ran out into the night screaming and sobbing. The moon was red. It was gobbling up all the love in my life. My grandfather dragged me home as I screamed at that hungry red moon....This was around the time the headaches started. All day, everyday. I was diagnosed with chronic daily migraine. I dropped my first semester of school. I checked myself into the mental hospital. My depression became controllable, but the headaches didn't. I slept all the time, I couldn't do anything. The medications didn't work. Finally, I went back to school, if only for my mental health. By then I was on daily doses of hydrocodone.

All I wanted was to be healthy and happy. I reconnected with my friends, and made a few new ones. Though, even then the pain depprion would still get to me. One night I slashed my my arm. I wanted my pain to be visible, tangible-but I realized this caused me no comfort, only a grave sadness from my family. I swore I would never hurt myself again. I became a regular at the ""bro"" lunch table. One such bro was Jake. He didn't really talk to me much. All I could really tell mas that he had a nice head of curly hair and a wonderful nose. That, and the fact that he had the appetite of no other person I had ever seen in my life. He would sometimes join my friend's ""artist table movie nights"". Showing up more and more often, I wondered where this dude had come from. He was a charming fellow. Geeky in all aspects and always full of information. One day we discovered he only lived about 3 blocks from my house! That's when I started to accompany him on his walks around the neighborhood. He shared with me his music, his old school, his memories, and I shared with him mine.

Despite my pain I was determined to attend Senior Ball. I had already missed out on enough. I went with two art buddies, Rachel and Tom, Jake, and some cute asian chick I didn't know. Rachel had made  matching caution tape flower bracelets and pins for us. Jake and I became a sort of ""fake, old-fashioned, sophisticated couple"" for the evening. I had never enjoyed daces, but I had the time of my life. I forgot entirely about my headache.

That night we all slept over at Tom's house. Movies went into chatting which led to truth or would you rather, then simply a session of sharing. I finally admitted to the time I cut myself. Everyone was so supportive and comforting. Jake's confession seemed to come out of nowhere. I had no idea anyone could feel such a way for me. I was no moved when he leaned over, put his face on my shoulder and asked my to be his girlfriend, despite him knowing I was gay. I wanted to let him down gently, he was such a nice guy and I didn't want to hurt him. But instead I said yes. I still don't know why.

That summer was the best summer of my life. I've never felt so close to someone before. We spent almost every day together. He was like no other guy I had ever known before. He never asked anything of me, only my company. Everything felt so right with him. I asked to see him, and I showed him myself. Despite being as far from a woman as one could be he was all I wanted. We were each others first. For the first time in my life I truly felt loved and I returned that with every inch of my being.


Jake is currently off at college to study engineering. Despite being 8 hours away we still talk every day and I look forward to visiting him next month and every other time afterwards.


Of course, I get a lot of questions about this.
""So, you're not gay. You must be bi.""

Well, no. I'm not attracted to men. I look at guys and they are just guys. I look at women and I see a whole ocean of beauty and possibilities. I look at Jake and I see even more.






""So, no. I'm not bisexual. I like girls and I love Jake!""

We've been exclusively together for all of that time (well, very nearly all - that's the problem), married for thirteen of those years, and I have never had to try to date outside of college.

Despite a long time together, great kids together, and my willingness to work on any relationship issues, she decided it all wasn't enough for her. She's been having an affair since the end of last year. I found out a few weeks ago, we're working on getting a divorce settlement put together, and it's over.

Enough with the sob story, that's something that certainly is going to have to be left mostly out of any discussions with women in the future, anyway. My questions (well, the ones appropriate to this post, anyway; I have plenty of them) have to do with dating. I'm not really starting yet, but I'm a ""be prepared"" kind of guy. I'm going to be dating again soon, definitely casually for a while, and I want to get some idea of how I ought to approach some things.

1.  Ideas on getting out there and meeting some women would be great. I'm familiar with the general ideas of joining clubs where I might meet women with interests similar to mine, keeping myself open to meeting people in my day-to-day activities, and maybe even putting together an online profile at a dating site or two. But does anyone have some favorites that might apply to a single dad of small kids in his late thirties, i.e., a guy who isn't going to have a lot of time to burn? I'm not going to be looking for my next wife, certainly not anytime soon, so what are the best ways to try to start casually dating in this life that's so different from college, where I'm not randomly meeting tons of cute, single girls all of the time? Anyone have favorite ideas for how you would like or expect to meet a guy in my situation?

2.  What is casual dating like for a guy like me - or what SHOULD it be like. I mean, I don't feel like I'm going to be into romantic dinners and deep personal conversations any time soon. What do the ladies of Reddit like as a casual dating option? What would be a good go-to for first dates and getting to know some new friends?

3.  How much have grooming expectations changed in eighteen years? I mean, I keep myself up. I'm fit, I work out, I'm in pretty good shape for a guy who's closer to 40 than 35. I'm a professional, so I generally dress neatly enough, keep my hair neatly cut, have my beard either clean-shaven or (if I'm feeling crazy) neatly trimmed down to a bit of scruff, and eyebrows trimmed enough (usually when I get my hair cut) that they don't turn into the old man caterpillars. Is there anything else outward that I need to see to?

4.  Any other thoughts you'd like to share with a guy in my position? I'm not going to be desperate about looking for love, I'm not really going to be crazy and going overboard about it at all. But I know I'm going to want to start meeting some women for fun and companionship, and I could use some advice on doing that in my new reality. I feel like a time traveler thrust into a brand new dating situation two decades removed from everything he ever knew.

This means I buy comics drawn by fans - which are in Japanese - scan them, translate to English, and upload it to the internet. This is a widely practiced phenomenon, and I didn't think anything of it at all and did it without remorse.


The thing is, I ended up being friends with one of the artists. Even met up with them three times in Japan, hanging out, and they're terrific. They even drew art for me (like an entire sketchbook)!


I want to tell them what I do, because I just feel very guilty doing this without their permission, but I'm not quite sure how to break the ice. They are a tough person to get a hold of, e-mails they rarely respond to, texts even less, and the only time I can get them to respond is if I bother them on Twitter - which means it's public, and I'd rather keep it private. Telling them in person is not an option anymore (they live in Japan/I already left).

I'm not quite sure how to approach this. Tips are very appreciated.

(x-post from /r/Relationship_advice)",15,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1ec2qg/girlfriend_f24_of_6_months_is_christian_i_m30_am/,"First off, she is not what i would call a strict or legalistic Christian. In other words, we live our lives very similarly. We love to travel, see live music, drink beer and wine, etc. We are completely in love with one another and constantly enjoy our time together. We both agree that we have never been so happy with any of our past SO's.

A little background on me: I used to be a Christian.. but i was more of what i'd call a very ""strict christian"". I was heavily involved in local ministry in college, and went on several mission trips.. etc. By the time i was about 22, i was questioning it all very heavily. I was doing a great deal of studying the roots of Christianity, conflicting translations, how the Bible was put together, etc. In the end, after years of struggle, i lost my faith and i accepted that i no longer believed in the god of the Bible (or the god of other major religions in the world). 

My view now is that maybe there's a god, but i certainly can't prove it or feel it. If god exists, i believe it's more of a force than a personable entity that is intimately involved in our day to day business. I do believe there is a supernatural realm which none of us really understand.. or maybe it's a different dimension that we catch a glimpse of every once in a while.

She was raised in a very strict Christian home, but then strayed from it during her teenage years. She has since come to believe again, but not in as traditional of a sense. She believes in Jesus and that he is the way. She doesn't believe that every word in the Bible is necessarily truth though. But she wants to live her life based on Jesus and worship him as god and wants to raise her future children in the same way. 

Our differing faiths are the only real problem we have. For me, it's certainly an issue, though it's one i can see past. This is probably due to the fact that my Agnosticism does not require any regular ritual, prayer. 

It's a much larger worry/issue for her. While she does not regularly attend worship service, it does happen on occasion, and she'd like it to be a regular part of her life in the future. I am totally supportive of this. I've never tried to separate her from her faith. In fact, I always tell her that she should continue doing it if it works for her.

I offered to attend a church service with her.. something that later happened, and it ended up hurting more than it helped. We went to a Methodist church, and i brought my bible along and was completely respectful. but, we both knew i was just going through the motions. While she appreciated me reaching out to her and doing this, it hurt her to know that i was not there for a higher purpose (God). i was only there for her.

She says that she loves me and can see a future together for us, but that she's very scared of this fundamental difference we have. She is sad that we won't be able to pray together. Also, she's worried of how challenging it might be for us to raise children together while having a different world view. I definitely think that can be a challenge. However, im not the agnostic guy who is going to say that my wife and children are prohibited from attending church. Instead, i'd like to raise my children to be free thinkers... though I think it's nearly impossible to raise children in america without them being indoctrinated to some extent. I personally was not raised in a strict christian environment, but i still believed it for years. I took me into my early 20's to really start to question things. I just want my children to be good people and open-minded. If they end up being Christians, that's ok with me, so long as they aren't the kind who go forcing it on other people disrespectfully.

What are your opinions? is this a difference that we can get past? I'm interested if any of you have been through this and were successful. If so, how did you do it?

I was immediately taken by how easy it was to talk to her/ hang out with her and started trying to pursue her. To keep it short, I hung out with her the whole semester and it was all going well until I started making some serious moves to try and show her my intentions (a la decorating her dorm for her birthday). She also kept seeming to throw me signals so I charged along with the courtship. Alas, after countless failed attempts at starting something I decided it was a lost cause. I told her straight up I was done trying to woo her and she said she wasn't looking to be in a relationship. So that was that, and I get it, and felt okay with it.

Unfortunately after that I could not hang out with her any longer without feeling something for her, much as I tried. So I told her I had to take a break from hanging out for a while to clear my head. She understood. 

A couple months later, we have started hanging out again. And I'll be damned if the same feelings keep popping up even though I know it is a pointless endeavor. I tried that before and it didn't work and I know I should be able to move on. And I'm trying. But I want to still hang out with her, and every time I do... well, you get the idea.

Now, I know the advice I would give to myself if I were being objective. Either give it one last go, and see what happens, or just break off the friendship. I do not like either option. I'm not sure what other options there are that you guys can come up with, but I figure its worth a shot. So please, let me know if you have any ideas.

This is my disclaimer:

**Disclaimer:** The opinions expressed represent my own and only my own. They are conjecture and speculation based solely on my observation and personal experience. This is not a comprehensive compendium covering concerning situations completely. (It is not intended to answer any and all problems, in fact. It's not intended to answer any problems at all)

**The problem/observation:** The problems and most of the advice here is based around and phrased in the context of ""what should I do?""

• I'm feeling something I don't like, how do I handle it?
• My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike, how do I handle it?
• Should we stay together or break up? 
• How do I start a relationship with a boy/girl?

The majority of problems expressed around these parts are variations of these questions. I'll address each of them individually, but the gist is this:

**The Gist:** I feel the approach to a problem is of equal importance as the solution. Very little attention is paid in regards to HOW someone should think about the problem that they are currently addressing. This type of mental engineering can be a powerful tool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike, how do I handle it?**

The first step here is to identify not just the ""thing"" that your SO did that doesn't sit well, but to also accurately identify how it makes you feel, and WHY it makes you feel this way. These are all critical components to articulating your problem.

For instance, the ""thing"" could be: Your SO has pictures of memorabilia of a past relationship displayed on Facebook or their room that make you uncomfortable.

How it makes you feel: Probably a little jealous and insecure. 

Why: You wonder if they are harboring feeling for the ex (jealous and insecure). You are concerned what others think (insecure). You don't like to be reminded they dated another person (jealous with a possessive twist).  

The next step, and I think the most useful, is to consider that you might be wrong. Even if you are convinced beyond that shadow of a doubt that you're in the right. Even if all your friends say you’re right. DO THIS ANYWAY!

How to consider if you're wrong:

To get your mind in the right place for this exercise you need to do a few things. Remind yourself that you have a bias toward yourself. Be skeptical. 

You now what to try and understand the other persons point of view. This is something people do often, but incorrectly. I'm going to scream at you for a moment because this point is very important. 

**DO NOT ASSUME OTHER PEOPLE THINK LIKE YOU!** If you are trying to understand their point of view by imagining what YOU would do in their situation, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG! People don't necessarily share your way of thinking, your priorities, or your ""common sense."" Thinking outside the context of your own mind is a precious skill that takes discipline and practice.

To continue the example above. Take a step back. Does your boyfriend or girlfriend keep pretty much everything? Is he/she nostalgic. Does this person consider his past a strong way to define and identify who he is today? Is there any evidence (outside of photos/memorabilia) to indicate he has questionable feelings toward the ex. 

So say your SO a ""scrap booker"", nostalgia type. You have to admit to yourself that, while if you had pictures of your ex it, it would MEAN something. In all likelihood your SO having those things probably doesn't indicate that they might still have feelings for a past lover. That does NOT mean that those photos aren't important to your SO. They could still be very important.

The key is to consider what you know about them to be true. Rely on observation and be accepting of wherever that takes you. It might not make sense, but reality is correct (or closer to the truth than your conjecture).

 It's now time to consider the dilemma as a whole. What are you going to ask them to do or change? How big of an adjustment is it for THEM? How much will it probably matter to THEM? And compare that do how much this ""thing"" bothers you. Basically, if you are asking them to make a big change (in their mind) it better matter to you a lot. You need to have a strong argument to bring to the table that takes their feelings and needs into consideration. Now, I'm not advocating anyone be a doormat. But if there is a serious disparity between how much it matters to them (tons), and how much it matters to you (a little), you might want to consider not bringing it up at all. This is called ""picking your battles.""

If you decide it's worth the trouble to bring it up, make sure you pick a good time to do so. By now you already have done the requisite thinking to explain your side. It is always useful to go through your though process for their side as well. It shows them that they are important in the discussion and that you put forward an honest attempt to consider their side. This often times is enough to take them off the defensive. It's important you listen to what they say, you could have been way off in your assessment of how meaningful the problem is to them. 

Once you feel like you both understand each others side of the argument, it is time to decide what to do. The goal here is to create the largest net gain in happiness between the both of you. Their happiness is just as important as yours. Usually means compromise. If they agree to change, it is your job to be patient and understanding as long as they make an honest effort….etc.   

As a side note: If someone is really emotionally charged. You lose NOTHING by suggesting you share some of the blame. It makes them feel a lot better and can defuse the situation. Arguments are not about who is right or wrong They are about making changes so you both can get what you want.

What kind of guy would be nice to a girl only for the sole purpose to have sex with them?

I'm not saying that I'm a nice guy, but generally I treat people how they treat me. If they're nice, I'm nice. If they're mean, I'm mean. If I haven't interacted with them yet, I'm polite to them by default. 

However, if I'm with a girl I'm interested in, I'll generally be more interested in what they have to say and if they ask me to do something I'll be more likely to do it (within reason). Why? Because I don't want to seem like a douchebag. 

Now, according to reddit, because of that I'm a sex deprived douchebag. I don't understand the mentality here, I'm pretty sure that everyone does that and it's human nature (heard about that somewhere when I was studying psychology for school), regardless of gender.

A little background, I (21m) have been in three long term relationships, the first being two years, the next being three years and the most recent being three months with a courting time of three years (as friends). If I had to come up with the number one complaint of all my previous girlfriends it would be that I’m great at the chase but not so much after. I try to follow the adage of “date your wife” in my case girlfriend, but while I try, it seems I’m always hearing “you’re not lovey dovey enough.” 

The first relationship ended because she felt like I was growing disinterested in the relationship and ended up falling for my best friend, though I never did lose interest. The one after her would often get into very lovey moods and would want to talk about how we feel about each other and how much we love each other for 15-20 mins almost daily, and while sometimes I felt it and engaged her in these conversations more times than not it was just me saying “yeah, babe, I feel the same way too, I love you a lot.” And I would want to go on talking about other things. After we broke up which was not entirely related to my non romance, she told me that she felt like I didn’t really like the relationship at all and sometimes doubted how much I really loved her, and to me she’s “the one that got away” I loved her like no other and in a lot of ways still do, and it hurt a lot to hear that from her. My most recent relationship I kept the chase up for three years and her interest in me up for the entire time, for various reasons we didn’t date in those three years but the flirting and sexual tension were there and several months ago we were both in a place that we decided to date and 2 months in she tells me “you’re not cute like you used to be, it’s like you’ve got me and stopped.” A month later we broke up.

To an extent that is how I work, I’m a lot better at wooing a girl it seems than the relationship part of it. Am I just bad boyfriend material and doomed to fall in love over and over only to end up pushing them away due to my lack of romance or can this be rectified? I do romantic things for them while we’re in the relationship, my most recent ex, I had flowers delivered to her at work when she was having a hard time at the new office, I can think of a lot of other times I did romantic things for all three but the issue is still there. Any tips for me on being more overall romantic and not just when I do romantic things?

I also noticed that she had been tagged in some pictures on facebook with some guy she met who was attending the same program.  She has to stay on campus for this program Monday - Friday and can come home on weekends.  She told me that she would be coming home on the weekends and we could see each other then.  Tonight she told me in a text she wasn't coming up on any of the weekends.

I asked if she was mad at me or if I'd unintentionally done something to make her mad at me and she said no.  I asked if I could visit her at the college instead of the other way around.  She said, ""Um...Yes, but my friend Benton is coming to visit me this weekend.""

I told her I didn't understand.  If everything was okay why had she been ignoring my texts and why hadn't she told me earlier I could come and visit her?  She responded, ""Yeah, I gotta go to bed.  Sorry!  Bye!""

Sometimes we spoon, sometimes she sleeps with her head on my chest, sometimes I just have my arm around her.  She is a pretty deep sleeper, which actually plays into my favor a bit.

When I sleep alone, I do a lot of tossing and turning, rolling over and throwing my arms around, kicking my sheets and rolling over some more.  As far as I know, this is only before I fall asleep, its as if I have restless body syndrome (not sure if that actually exists, but I do have trouble sitting still through classes that are only an hour long) and I'm not sure how to control it. :p  I like to initially lie on my left side, and then after a while roll over to my right side just before I fall asleep.  It also takes me considerably more time to fall asleep than she does (she can be asleep in around 5, takes me at least 20 when I'm alone, 1-2 hours with her) which means I get to just lie there in silence.

When we sleep together I have to try my hardest not to roll over every couple of minutes.  I often *can't* roll over because my arm is under her from spooning or something.  So I lie there, and I'm fighting every urge to roll over or move up until I just can't stand it anymore.  I'd slowly start pulling my arm out from under her, and then she wakes up &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; or becomes half-conscious.  So I'd quickly pull my arm out from under her and roll over, so that we're back to back, which isn't very loving at all, which I really hate, but its the only way I can fall asleep.  Many times, I'd end up waking her up 3-5 times throughout the night before I fall asleep, which isn't very considerate.

I've tried keeping the arm that usually goes under her to myself (throwing it behind me in some awkward way) and just putting my top arm over her, so that I can roll over later on, but then my lower arm ends up losing blood or getting cold.  There is no winning in this!  

How can I train myself to lie still?  I tried last night by myself, and I think I ended up rolling over more than I usually do!

When I showed him the [1] pic  of what I was thinking of, he let out an audible groan.
He keeps reiterating that even though he wouldn't stop me from doing it if I really wanted to, it wouldn't be something that he would like.

So, the question is, should I respect his opinion and not cut my hair any shorter- or is it unreasonable for him to have input concerning matters of my appearance?

On the one hand, it kind of bugs me that he would actually dislike the haircut on me if I got it. On the other hand, I guess I think that if he's the only one I'm really trying to impress, why would I do something he explicitly said he wouldn't like the look of?

1370889105.0,12,self.relationship_tips,1g26xr,"I unfriended an ex I was on good terms with on Facebook in a moment of bad judgment, can I re-add him without looking crazy and if I do what do I say?",13,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1g26xr/i_unfriended_an_ex_i_was_on_good_terms_with_on/,"I'm 23F, my ex is 26M. We dated three years ago for not very long, he broke up with me because he was still hung up on his ex. The breakup was amicable. He wanted to be friends and tried a few times to contact me, which I ignored. I contacted him a little over a year ago to catch up, and we started a friendship that lasted about a year. We are both in happy relationships and were fine with talking about our current significant others. We had coffee together before I moved for grad school, and we actually told each other the stories of how our current relationships began. He was surprisingly a pretty darn good friend at times, from asking how the packing for my move was going to sending me a supportive message when someone I loved died.


However, it started to get a little weird when I misconstrued things he'd text to me as being more meaningful than they were (he is a flirty/friendly person in general) and I developed some confusing feelings about the situation. I was honest with my boyfriend about all of this, and he knew I would never leave him for my ex--it was just confusing to me to hear compliments coming from him. Then, I suggested hanging out again to my ex (since we had done coffee before), he said it sounded like a good idea, but then he kind of went off the map. He stopped contacting me like he had been and it changed from a text-once-a-month friendship to being a friendly facebook acquaintance relationship. He would 'like' a post on my wall, I sent him a message saying sorry when his pet died.


Even though it was probably not all that unfriendly (maybe he didn't feel like staying in such frequent contact with someone who lives several hours away, maybe he/his gf wasn't comfortable with me suggesting we hang out again), I felt like I'd been rejected again, and I felt jealous of FB posts of him and his new gf, even though I DO NOT want to date him and I absolutely adore my boyfriend. I unfriended him a little over a month ago late one night when I was particularly exhausted/sad so I wouldn't have to see those posts. To be blunt, I screwed up.


Now, I just feel like a petty bitch--no fights or animosity had occurred to warrant unfriending him (heck, we'd had a conversation just a month before when I sent him a message saying sorry about his pet dying). He didn't contact me after I unfriended him but I knew he wouldn't--he confessed to me that when I had ignored his texts immediately post break-up years ago that he had assumed I ""hated him."" I feel like that jealousy-stage was mostly due to other problems going on in my life at the time. I don't need to be talk-once-a-month kind of friends with him again, but I'd like for us at least be friendly acquaintances who don't hold any unnecessary grudges.


I'm concerned that since we run in similar circles back home that sometime in the future I'll run into him again, and I'd rather it not be crazy uncomfortable when it doesn't have to be. I figure I can't refriend him any time soon (that would look/be insane), but is there any acceptable amount of time that can pass before I refriend him? And if I can refriend him, what should I say? I thought about citing the mass facebook purge excuse but my gut says he won't believe it. I know facebook should not be the be-all and end-all of real life relationships, but unfortunately it has an impact--it really boils down to me wanting to retract the rude message I conveyed by unfriending him, since for some reason, acts in facebook = acts in meatspace.

I am actually quite romantic for the big things (birthdays, Valentine's Day, etc) but her concern was what was lacking all the time in between those occasions.

So basically, I'm asking for your help and ideas of creative, easy, and inexpensive ways to make her feel special, appreciated (because she is an awesome girlfriend and I really want her to be happy and not lose her), and happy. I don't know if this matters but she is a little on the high maintenance side and definitely a girly girl but she says that I don't necessarily need to spend a lot of money or buy her extravagant gifts, just show her that she's appreciated and special and a priority.

Put briefly, my father (54) had a sexual 3 year relationship with my best friend (now 21) from high school. He claimed that there was nothing happening and I (23) publicly defended this relationship for a very long time. When this hit the fan, my mother divorced him, he bounced around until moving in with his girlfriend (of two weeks, age 48).

At the time I didn't feel like I should tell him not to do this, because I encouraged him to date someone who wanted the same things out of life that he did.

Since my parents divorced he has totally turned his back on me. I am a student, trying to work my way through school. He promised $300 towards tuition, and hasn't followed through. He ditched my sister and I on Christmas, later telling me that it wasn't worth his time because our traditions were bad because my mother always ruined them. Therefore we should just do all of his new family's traditions. I didn't even get a birthday card this year!

They've been together less than a year (probably about 8 months), and I just found out, through the grapevine of people who thought I knew, that they're getting married on April 27th! He didn't tell me, no invitation, no phone call, no ""hey how do you feel about this?"" Nothing.

When I confronted him about not telling me about the wedding, he claimed that he told me and that I just ""forgot"" and officially invited me. He told my sister that he talked to me about it, and that I was happy for them and was going to be there. She wasn't and isn't planning on going, and after learning about how he lied is absolutely furious.

He has been officially divorced for only two months now, hasn't dated this woman for even a year.

Do you think that it is tacky for me not to go to this wedding? Do you think that her large Italian family will resent me and my sister if we don't go (they already don't like us because we aren't loud family people)? If I choose not to go, does this mean that I'm cutting him out of my life? I don't really know what to do and I would love the opinions of people who aren't my biased friends. Thanks!

Things have recently been pretty rough (past 2 years) as she is headed toward a PHD and I am working full time plus and trying to get an associates degree.  

I want a child now and have for about two years, she hasn't for various reasons.  I think that I want a child is because I want someone to do things with.

Any time I suggest we go out she furrows her brow or says ""booo"" or things like that.  I would like to go to art exhibits, sporting events, hikes, general things like that.  

When I ask if she wants to do things she says I should ask one of my younger brothers who are single and always bored.  I also don't have any friends to go hang out with.  I have tried to explain to her that I want to do these things with her but she doesn't care. If I do manage to get her out she seems to have an enjoyable time and typically says that it was nice to get out and do xyz.  

I had an epiphany this week and realized we are becoming her parents.  They didn't have kids until their 30's (not typical at all where I live), MIL never goes out and only reads/watches tv, FIL goes to movies and sporting events alone multiple times a week.

I always feel lonely and we just had a blow out fight because its Saturday afternoon and I wanted to go do something.  She could tell I was upset and asked what was wrong then kept poking it as I tried to deflect it.  I burst and laid it all out.

 This has always been a problem for us since now I just assume it will happen. Also, when he makes friends they become a huge part if his life. That's his personality and I love him to death. But I find myself slowly starting to dislike him a little because of it. The thing that's been bothering me the most lately is that he talks to this girl online while playing halo. They've done it so many times that they also have each others numbers. The girl will text my bf sometimes. I asked my bf if she liked him and he said ""the only thing she ever texts me about is when she wants to play halo"". And then showed me on his phone how all her texts just said, ""halo?"". I scrolled up a little on the convo on his phone to see that the previous texts said, ""I'm always excited to talk to you"" and ""I love you! :p"". Ok. This is harmless enough since she lives hundred of miles away. But it's annoying because he still chats with her and he doesn't know that I saw those texts.

None of them were titled ""How to give a great back rub,"" which is where I'd like to start.

Where did you learn how to give a back rub? Do you have a routine that makes her (or him I guess) purr every time? What do you do when your hands are clammy (mine always are)?

After getting the back rub down, I'd love to take this further and maybe take one of those more advanced classes. What kind of class should I look for though? I want to be able to give a great-feeling massage—one that's not specifically therapeutic or athletics-optimized.

We were friends to begin with and that's why I'm keen to go back to being friends, but I wanted any advice you guys can give me to help make the transition easier. I completely realize that there is no point in trying to beat a dead horse, it will either happen or it won't. These things take time and have to happen naturally if at all.

1347966948.0,10,self.relationship_tips,102oas,GF(23) recovered from trust issues onset by BF(26) who cheated on me during the first half of the relationship,16,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/102oas/gf23_recovered_from_trust_issues_onset_by_bf26/,"This sounds like it is a train wreck relationship by just reading the title. **But after scoping the threads to see if anyone had come out positively from a 'been cheated on' experience with their SO, I couldn't come up with much.** I just wanted to post and say that it can happen! But it's a lot of work.

Short version: My BF finally confessed on his own accord that he had been cheating on me with one of his ex girlfriends from when we met --&gt; month 6. Kept it from me (and convinced his friends to lie for him) until month 13. Told me the news two days before Christmas :(

I had a no-bullshit policy since day one. We agreed that our lives were an open book to one another, and in actuality none of us cared to pry into emails, phones, etc. Just wasn't necessary, and I didn't desire to. I told him that if I was going to be in a relationship, I would tell him the second I no longer wanted to be in one. We both agreed.

So obviously I was heartbroken. With much courage and strength, I:

- Berated him for the first day. Explained to him what a lucky piece of shit he was to have (or have had) me. Cried.
- took a week without contacting him. told him that on day 7 he could contact me with his 'resolve,' if he wanted to work things out.
- mourned for the fact that it meant more for me at that point to say 'I love you' to him than him to say it to me because of his actions.
- drew my bottom line: if by the end of the month (it was the 10th) I didn't see myself capable of positive progression towards forgiveness and recovery, and his persistent effort to make things right, we were done. period. even wrote it on my calendar!
- exercised a shit ton. endorphins! and even felt GREAT when I looked at FB pictures of this girl and felt better about how much prettier I was than her (a low blow, but a well deserved right to vanity in my situation, not ever to be used in any other context)
- picked up his phone call on day 7. he had severed ties with her as far as he could (they went to high school together and after all, SF is still a small town in a big city), but more importantly, he had sat down with his family and admitted his actions, asking for help to save our relationship. His mother had smacked him on the back of the head for me. She cried, and later told me he had never asked for any advice of that kind before.
- I went out on a limb, blindly. I didn't buy the bullshit sobs, the promises, the pleads; but I put my faith in the man who told me he needed to re-evaluate his whole life and the direction he was going as indicated by his cheating behavior. 
- everything was a day-to-day basis with trust. Some days it was better, some days it was worse. I slowed myself down and wished for the innocence and naiveness I had began my relationship with, the full blown trust I once had.

- rebuilt the trust on my half. I was *SO* angry at him for a while because he had dug a hole this deep, but for however long I saw it as only him in that hole, we couldn't come out of that hole together as a relationship. 
- we are approaching year 2, and a weight is lifted when I can say with confidence that **I can trust my BF again**. I initially thought I shouldn't have to, that he was 'disposable' and just an 'overlooked asshole,' but since i put in the work to revive our trust, this is the most communicative, constructive, loving, forgiving, respectful, and enjoyable one yet. I've learned so much.

I don't know what your situation is, nor do I condone in any matter prolonging any physically or emotionally abusive situations by thinking that *you* doing the work will fix it; 

**TLDR; I want you to know that there *is* a 'there and back.' It sucked, and I wouldn't let it happen a 2nd time, but I would go back and do it again if I had to.**

1346322585.0,10,self.relationship_tips,z2kj5,I(31M) am spying on my girlfriend(f27) (we´ve been together for 18 months) (xpost from relationship_advice),17,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/z2kj5/i31m_am_spying_on_my_girlfriendf27_weve_been/,"My girlfriend is a bit volatile and unpredictable due to her manic depressive tendencies. She's on medication and generally ""normal"". About 3 months ago I started having suspicions that I wasn't the only guy in her life. After asking probing questions several times and having a strong instinct that she was evasive, I spied her phone-lock and started reading her texts when she wasn't looking. I avoided snooping in anything that didn't look suspicious to preserve as much of her privacy as possible. Last month I noticed a conversation with a contact that had a girls name where she referred to the person with a mans name in the text that was most recent. I discovered she had frequently been talking to a guy for about 6 months and met him in secret while lying to me and telling she was meeting a girlfriend. Right before the meet she had sent a text with the words: ""Have I been in love with you all along??"".

I confronted her with her phone in-hand and without concealing my spying. She denied everything straight to my face, for every accusation I made (that she´d met him, that she had feelings for him, etc.), I had to open the particular text-message and show her before she would acnowledge the accusation. She told me they had met once, and she´d known the second she saw him that her feelings were false and that I was the one she loved and that nothing happened that evening except they ate dinner and shared a few drinks at the bar, my instincts tell me she´s telling the truth about not having sex, not that it matters really.) I was furious, but kept it in check. I decided there was a tricky but possible future for us, and so I didn´t break up with her on severeal conditions, the most important of which was that she would never, ever, lie to me again.

Fast forward 3 weeks, we´ve gone through all the motions, the anger is still there but the relationship is healing. I hadn´t been able to fully let it go and were still asking her questions, trying to fill in the gaps and getting a full grasp of the situation. I wanted to know more about the guy. She didn´t want to tell me his last name, I insisted that there be no more secrets between us and she relented. I proceeded to find out as much as I could about the guy and showed her his facebook page to confirm it was him. She said I should stop and that this was pointless. I kept on pushing, and she told me that wasn´t the guy (someone random she´d once hooked up with in a bar), that infact it had been her ex, what had thrown me off was that she had used his middle-name in the text conversation.
She said she had lied to make things easier, that she was afraid I´d break up with her if I knew it was someone she´d had serious feelings for.

In any case, as you can imagine, any progress was undone and I have no trust whatsoever in what she says.

So, I decided, the only way to move forward was to put my trust in incubation so to speak and instead of relying on her words, rely on facts. Without her knowledge I have access to her facebook, e-mail and phone(text-messages and call logs via spy app). I've gone through her home, her credit card bills and checked every entry.
So far nothing suspicious. So what I'm asking for is this: those of you whom have caught cheating SO's, how did you catch them? What can I look for that I'm not allready?


I have kept the text factual to get to the point quickly, but it's misrepresentative without the feelings side of it: I am madly (quite literally, as you can see) in love with this girl. I am willing to go full-Jack Bauer on this relationship to save it. I believe whole-heartedly in redemption and that given insight, people can learn and thus change. I also believe people lie, so looking for someone else is not my idea of a solution, it's surrendering. The spying is not to satisfy my curiosity and give me a sense of control alone, it has a purpose: Nasty and morally wrong as it is, it provides temporary stability and solid ground for me to stand on while repairing the damage. There can be trust in the future, but not as long as I'm worried about the present. It's disgusting to me to have to go through her garbage so to speak in this manner and I don't plan on doing it for longer than I have to. What would also help tremendously, is if I can verify that what she has told me about the past is true and that is what I am asking you for - tips&amp;tricks on accomplishing a very difficult task: verifying a negative.

I don't play ""hard to get."" I don't ""play"" anything. Tricks and games are for children, so I hate how ppl write extreme anxiety off as ""playing"" with a guy.

I realize it's a lot to hope a guy whom I don't know will see my shyness/anxiety for what it is, and not as rejection.

My issue is something that has gone on since the beginning. He gets annoyed when I ask questions he believes to be irrelevant. If I call him, and ask him what he's up to, it's always ""nothing"". If I say, ""So.. you're just staring blankly at a wall?"" He'll say, ""Yup."" It's always nothing unless he's doing something of importance. If he tells me he's cooking, I'll ask what he's cooking curiously, and he will say something on the lines of ""Why?"" and I'll respond, ""Because I'm curious?""

Me: ""For what?""

Me: ""And I was curious where. It's not a weird thing to ask. Ask anyone. You're weird for finding it annoying/pointless.""
Him: ""I'm glad you found the information useful. I have no problem telling you what I'm doing. It's not about it being weird, it's unnecessary.

Me: ""Significant others do that kind of shit because they are curious and they give a fuck unlike most other people you may know. It's not fucking weird. ASK SOMEONE."" (I'm upset because I want another person to tell him he's being odd so he can see. Everyone I tell says he is.)

I figured I'd put in my own insight

I met my girlfriend back in college as we were both studying for the same degree. We didn't talk much then except for the occasional school banter or awkward conversation. I took notice to her foo fighters shirt and circa survive sticker on her book and assumed we had more in common than music and our profession. 

A year later she had already graduated and I was fulfilling a clinical rotation at the hospital she was working at. After awkward nervous conversations about school we began having lunch together, which led to Facebook conversations and text/phone conversations after work. Soon became weekend meetups and eventually to where we are today. 

Now let's get away from the history,
When I met her I had no idea she has a 10 year old daughter or was actually 34. Her looks and interests indicated younger. I found out her age when we became Facebook friends and I realized her birth year was within the 70s. Scary at first but I was already fond of her.

I did not go into our relationship seeking a relationship. It basically started out for both of us as a ""hey you're attractive what could go wrong"" situation. No expectations thus no limits.

Personally I feel as though age CAN be a problem in a relationship. I have friends of mine close to my age who still live at home, make minimum wage,  ow money on booze, sleep with disgusting 18 year old strumpets and have no problem with that. So someone living that way should not expect to have a chance with a settled down, established single mother who has no time for bullshit.

For us our places in life our similar. She was married for a short short time and was forced to move home after her divorce. We both after a year of being together decided to move in to a house together with her daughter. 

We still go out and live life and have a blast, I am no way limited in what I do by her.

It is true that future children, life plans, intentions and what not do need to be discussed fast. 

Our family and friends gave a raised eyebrow at first to the 11 year difference but once the social bias fades they realize what's important. 

Weve been together a little over a year and I couldn't be happier

I tried to make this brief. Feel free to comment with any questions 

Tl:dr age can be a problem if you're still acting like a kid
Places in life are more important
Social bias exists
Be up front and discuss serious issues

I have heard from mutual acquaintances that she also harbors some feelings for me. The dilemma is that she likes this other guy (senior-18) more, despite his lack of feelings for her. 

I asked her to our school prom and she said yes—she seemed very excited when I asked her. We have been on multiple dates, one being a basketball game that went fantastically, the other a dinner with her family and then a movie after that was just me, her, and some other friends that coincidently met us there. 

During the movie however, she was texting this guy she likes and after on the car ride home she was also still texting him and we didn’t have very much conversation unlike our car ride to the movie, that was filled with talking. 

TLDR; I like a girl, we are going to prom, and have gone on dates with her, but she still likes an older guy that does not reciprocate feelings for her.

My SO(23) and I (25) have been dating for 2 years. Who I love very much and have even gone through the traditional steps needed to ask her to be my wife. Here is the story.

We moved from Seattle to Up state NY, very far and very different from city living. We have a interesting scenario, to make thing short she is the bread winner in this relationship. She easily makes double if not triple than what I make/made. And as far as bills come we have a 75%/25% agreement on who pays what. For the most part she pays rent and I take care of everything else, such as Electric/Gas/Phones/Cable ect. 

She has been in training to deploy for the past month. It has been very taxing on me emotionally. My employers saw this but only in the way of my performance lacking, I received a write up because I had failed to turn in some keys and the following day a customer put in a complaint with my name thrown everywhere including the bus. So I was served a letter saying in the next 7 days I will be terminated. 

My biggest fear is disappointing her and this really isnt something you can just not mention and pretend it never happened. I am fed up with working retail and have made my mind up to return to school to get better work. But how do I tell her; A) I lost my job. B) I am going back to school. 

I was excited at the start of this week she would be coming home. Now, I am terrorized that I will be picking her up and in the back of my head Ill have to give her the news.

Been together for 3 years, not each other's first serious relationship. Although my work recently took me 8 hours from our shared apartment, we've lived together and trust me, we've seen the wide spectrum of each others' annoying habits and have learned to compromise so that everyone is happy. We've been through a fair amount together: his mother's double mastectomy following cancer, his sister going through rehab for addiction to painkillers, and me losing the career of my dreams because an injury prevented me from passing the Dept of Defense medical exam. I'm sure we'll face worse together in the future, but I'm confident that we make a great team to tackle whatever comes our way. We've been out of the honeymoon phase for years but we're still excited to see each other any time one of us walks through the door, and our communication and sex life have only gotten better since we first started dating.

**Making sure all of the ""big issues"" are discussed and more or less decided on before marriage is important to me** - we don't need to decide if we want 2 kids or 3, but we certainly need to decide if we want them and how to juggle careers and kids. Issues we've talked about so far:

* **Having kids.** Discussed how we will need to save $$$ before planning to start a family, especially if we want to avoid day care. Discussed at what age we feel like they might not need a parent at home all the time. Discussed me continuing to delay going to medical school until after the kids are a little older. Discussed whether or not we want to expose our children to religion.

* **Combining finances.** We both have separate IRA accounts. I'm more of a saver than he is, so he's proposed paying all of the major bills (rent, utilities, food) and I can put as much of my salary into savings/investments as possible. He will still continue to invest a bit of what he has left over after paying the bills. We will probably have joint account(s) and discuss purchases over $x before buying. Health insurance is not an issue. We currently have an apartment, but I have enough money saved for a down payment on a house.

* **Careers and location.** He's currently in the military and has no choice as to where he goes. The issue of kids notwithstanding, I do not plan to apply to medical school until he is out of the military and we can count on being in the same location. My skills are fairly portable and I'm currently being reviewed to work for the DoD near where he's stationed for the next 3 years. We both have useful degrees (computer science and biochemistry), and he can probably get the military to cover the cost of his Masters. We've determined that we probably can't be in the same place, have kids, and be active in our dream careers at the same time, and have compromised on the timing of those events so that neither one of us ever resents the other for missing those opportunities.

* **Pre-nuptial agreement.** I have more assets than he does. Neither of us anticipate needing to rely on a pre-nup for financial protection in the event of a divorce, but he says he's perfectly comfortable with signing one if I would like him to do so.
This isn't necessarily important before marriage, but medical emergency situations. Under what situations would either of us want (or not want) extreme life-saving measures to be taken. If not competent to make medical decisions, what decisions/procedures we would absolutely want to avoid.

I really love the job and I truly believe it was worth the move. I've gone from financial straits and living with my mother to having my own place and being paid way more than enough to cover my expenses and build up a serious nest egg. The experience I'm gaining is incredibly valuable for my current career development and the people I work with are fantastic. And the work I do even involves another of my interests, social media.

But my friendships from the old city have faded considerably. I need a social circle in the new city and I'm having trouble finding or building one. I generally try to get out to meetup groups and clubs when I'm not working and I even organize a meetup group myself. But what ends up happening is that I meet people at events and may see them again at future events with the same group but I never manage to connect with any of them beyond that. Even with the group I organize, I see them at the events I organize but otherwise have little contact with them at all.

How do I turn some of these acquaintanceships into friendships and (potentially) expand my social network?

1370494761.0,9,self.relationship_tips,1frtxl,"My boyfriend(24) has Borderline Personality Disorder and I(f21) have no idea how to handle him. In fact, he's disappeared...",12,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1frtxl/my_boyfriend24_has_borderline_personality/,"Hello everyone,



So my boyfriend(24) and I(21) have been together since February and I love him very much.  He has BPD and has been hospitalized a few times for cutting.  He suffers from severe social anxiety (if we even go out on his porch he gets a bit unsettled).  He has been prescribed Zoloft to treat his depression and anxiety, but he hasn't been taking his pills consistently.  He avoids taking them as long as possible, but when he gets withdrawals, he'll take a few.  



ANYWAY:




As I said, I really love my boyfriend, but I don't always know how to communicate with him.  He has trouble identifying what he's feeling and where his feelings come from.  During these times he shuts down and won't say a word to me.  I know he's not purposely trying to hurt me, but it hurts all the same.  

I try to be accepting of the fact that he isn't good around people.  I know he tries very hard to be intimate with me.  He often turns down sex because he says that sometimes being touched doesn't feel good to him.   He was abused as a child, his father passed away when he was 17, and he doesn't have a relationship with his mother or brother (aside from them constantly putting him down), so I can understand why being touched or being close to someone could be hard...but it still hurts me when he rejects a hug or a kiss or even holding my hand.  




He has a great fear of abandonment, and I don't have any plans to abandon him.  My issue is that he keeps shutting me out and pushing me away because he doesn't know how to get close to people.  



I sat him down about two weeks ago and told him exactly what I thought of him.  I told him that he's amazing and that I believe he can accomplish what he wants to accomplish.  I mean, my boyfriend is bloody brilliant, but he doesn't even see it!  He said that he feels he doesn't have the tools to help himself get back to school and get a degree.  I'm half way through university and I remember feeling the same way, so I told him we could work it out together.



He seemed to be in better spirits and he started taking Zoloft again.  This past Friday he left home to visit a few friends in the neighbouring city.  I was worried that while he was there, he'd forget to take his meds.  I told him this and he said I could call him to remind him if it would make me feel better.  



Friday night I called to remind him and he sounded pleasantly drunk.  I was excited because he sounded like he was having a great time.  Then he told me that he loved me and that I meant everything to him...and that I hurt him because I did not kiss him goodbye at the train station, but only hugged him goodbye.  He said he thought I was mad at him.



The thing is...my boyfriend has freaked out about PDA so many times that I thought kissing him would make him uncomfy.  I explained this to him, and he seemed satisfied.  He said he was going to go play video games and that he'd call me Saturday and see me Tuesday.  I suppose I may have complained a little about having to wait so long to see him, so he promised he'd head to my apartment Monday night.  



His mom has a boyfriend in the area where his friend lives, so she went to pick him up from his friend's house on Sunday and drive him back to our city.  He didn't get in the car with her.  He said he was going to another friend's house and that he'd be back home Monday.  He also didn't have his meds.  It's Wednesday and I still haven't heard from my boyfriend.  



I am angry that he broke his promises to me, and I am hurt that he is ignoring my phone calls.  But mostly, I'm worried about whether or not he's okay.  



Last night, I was mainly upset, and so I sent him an email saying how he hurt me and that I was tired of always reaching out to him because it feels one-sided.  I said that if he wanted to talk to me, he could just contact me first.  




I know that's a horrible thing for me to have said, but I was just so frustrated.  If I ever get slightly upset with him, he thinks it's the end of the world and that I'm leaving him.  I suppose it's black and white thinking which is something that people with BPD cope with.  As a result, I keep everything I feel inside.  I'm afraid to hurt him with my feelings...but I'm hurting myself by holding them in. 



I am trying to be understanding and accepting, but I'm not perfect.  Once, I went on vacation to New York and he agreed to pick me up from the bus station once I arrived in our home city.  I waited for an hour and a half and he never showed up.  He didn't text to say he wasn't coming to get me.  I was so angry.  I was fuming all the way to his house.  When I got to his house, he was curled up on his bed in tears.  I put my emotions aside and look after him because I really care for him.




Unfortunately, I can't keep swallowing how I feel. I also don't know how to get him to open up about what he's going through.  I'm scared to invalidate him or pressure him, but there are things I need from our relationship.  Communication would be great.  It turns out he didn't come get me at the bus station because of his social anxiety.  Why couldn't he just text me that?




I suppose I'm venting in this post as well, but I'm mostly wondering if there are any techniques I can use to talk to him about what I need from the relationship?  I already don't raise my voice.  I tell him that he can take his time and when he has panic attacks I remind him to breathe.  I just feel really silly doing all this.  It feels cliche and I wonder if it helps.  I never say stuff like ""just relax"" because I know that if he could ""just relax,"" he wouldn't have a problem.  




Everything I say/don't say up to this point seems to be just common sense.  I am doing my best to be compassionate and patient.  I want him to feel safe with me.  




In any case, I think I really fucked it up with my dumb email, but I really am worried about him.  If I'm lucky enough to hear from him, can anyone suggest better ways for both he and I to work through our conversations and our relationship in general?  



Was I unreasonable to ask him to step up and make an effort to contact me?  




**TL;DR:  My boyfriend has a mental illness that impacts our relationship.     Often, I feel useless/worthless because he rejects sex and doesn't have normal conversations with me.  I really want to make things work between us, but I'm afraid I messed things up by sending an email saying ""I'm tired of our relationship being one-sided, I need you to make an effort.""

I'm 26 and she's ~55yrs old (let me call her Donna). We work evenings from 3pm to midnight, with one other employee in a small room. When I started, I was warned by daytime staff members that Donna was a difficult person, but I was 22 and felt I was such a 'positive person', I could help this woman by being her friend. Since she is my mother's age, I didn't stop her when she would nag and remind me to do normal job tasks. It felt like working with my Mom, but it soon got worse. The other coworker on our evening shift was 65yrs old and had worked at the hospital since before most of it was built. She was slow, but near retirement. Donna started telling me that this Grandma-aged woman was a bad person, who would steal sandwiches from the hospital for her dinner break. Donna would get into arguments with the Grandma and talk about the injustice for months. One day, Donna saw that Grandma had made an error on the job and took her findings straight to Human Resources. The next week they fired Grandma. Donna was so satisfied that this ''weak-link'' had been eliminated from our evening shift.
We had a short rotation of different coworkers before our supervisor hired a 50yr old black woman who has worked per diem at the hospital for years. Donna instantly disapproved loudly and to anyone who would listen. She had no solid reasons; she claimed the new woman wasn't ""cut out"" for evening shift. (secretly i thought she was being racist) Eventually, Donna built a case of petty indescresions and took them to Human Resources. Before they would fire this new employee, they wanted more evidence. Donna looked to me for support, since I had always been friendly to her. I, however, had no problems with the new worker and would not support her case. Obviously, this made Donna's whole attitude toward me change. I was no longer on her good side and she made sure I felt it. She still managed to talk a couple of girls into reporting some petty issues and the 50yr old lady was fired.
I am now left with her… we have a rotation of random per diem employees who fill in the third spot, but I am with her every night. After she felt I betrayed her by not doing what she told me to, she began a campaign of constant complaining. She had always complained, but now she was complaining AT me. ""I can't believe the day employees left this equipment out, but YOU won't complain because YOU'LL just clean it up for them""
""You don't know how bad it is, WITHNAILxI, YOU haven't worked her for 7 years like I have"" Constant, all out, negative complaining to the point where I just let her talk at me while I worked and gave one word responses ""oh"" ""yeah"" ""right""… A lot of it was personal attacks on my friendly character. She would accuse me of ''having a boyfriend"" because the housekeeper knows my name and smiles when we exchange Hello's. My supervisor came really close to having her fired once, but she was back at work the next day because she threatened HR with a law suit.
Last month, the hospital sent out a Code of Conduct to be read and signed by all employees. It includes things like ""respect your patients and coworkers"", ""greet everyone in the hallways"" and ""commit to teamwork""… We all signed it. Last thursday, Donna had a melt down because someone had done something she felt wasn't ""protocol"" (it was NOT a big deal). She caught me alone in our office and started barking complaints at me, ""Dont you think we have protocols in place for a reason?! WHY does no one around here care! Why weren't YOU involved in correcting this issue? Whats the point in YOU being here, anyway?!"" …she had barked at me before, she told me that she ""knew"" I wasn't saying hello to her on purpose when I came into work, she had given me the silent treatment for days and refused to talk about it with me when I wanted it to end… but this last thursday felt like the thing that broke me. I called my supervisor. Met with her on Friday and told her everything. My supervisor asked me to meet with the HR department on Monday… Donna already has a long ''paper-trail'' with Human Resources since she has been fighting with everyone for so long. If I go in on Monday and report what this woman has been doing, I could be the thing that gets her fired. I DONT WANT THIS RESPONSIBILITY. I hate her so much but I'm struggling to justify this is my head. HELP ME DECIDE WHAT IS MORAL! **TL;DR My impossible-to-get-along-with coworker had two women FIRED in the past 5 years… Now I have the chance to have HER fired**

I tend to become romantically/sexually interested in people I’m already friends with, mainly because I get comfortable around them to trust and care about them, so to me, it seems logical that you would progress from friends→dating. That being said, I definitely do not befriend people in the hopes of getting romantically involved with them, and the idea of “friend zone” strikes me as being bad for everyone. Usually it’s a case of meeting someone, striking up a conversation, getting to know them and realising that *hey this person is actually really awesome* and somehow they sort of become extremely attractive. I’m not averse to asking them on date or whatever, and if they decline then that’s ok. But I’m unlikely to make a move unless I already have some sort of rapport.

The flipside is that I get bored very quickly with people who only seem to want to flirt but don’t want anything else, especially if they keep pushing after I’ve clearly indicated I’m not interested. I’ve certainly met one person lately who sends out a lot of signs that she’s interested, but if I respond she blocks me off, and if I don’t act interested she tries harder.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_1czzxa,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1czzxa/why_do_so_many_people_draw_such_a_huge/,

We would do some service here and there but it was never a factor in life. I went to a Christian Pre-school but went my separate ways in elementary school. I didn't go to much church at all until my parents divorced (due to a porn and sex addiction on my dad's part of which I found out years later) My mom met a new man and we started to attend his non-denominational mostly life lesson based church. I appreciated the messages and saw the positive impacts in them. I went to a few youth groups, but never felt the true draw towards them. Overall I think in my last few years and even now I see youth groups as a facade for the kids parents and a way to socialize by still appeasing them. The ones I see don't take Christianity truly to heart and use it as a spring board for other things.

I'm not sure that I believe in God. If I were to believe, I know that I would side with Christianity. I follow a lot of the scripture and see it having a lot of great purpose in life. But from a scientific and realist perspective I personally have never seen the affects of God in my life. I've tried prayer and I've never had a prayer answered. I know that I shouldn't rely on answers but I've never felt God's presence or felt as though I was connected. I feel like I am staying a Christian because I am a social conservative and dislike most atheists I have met because they are antagonist hateful anti-theists and that isn't the life I want to live. (not saying all are)

Morally and politically, I am a conservative. I believe in personal freedoms, but I am also for self regulation. I believe in a strong family unit, traditional marriage, saving yourself for marriage, not doing drugs, limiting alcohol if any, working towards yourself and providing charity when you can and when benefitial. I am 100% Pro-Life and that doesn't stem from my religion at all.

On a relationship level I have never had a girlfriend. I wouldn't call myself extremely attractive, but I know that my attractiveness hasn't hindered my that much so it must be my social status or personality. I tend to avoid people based on their choices and the way they carry themselves. I have very few friends and typically have that one friend in the large friend group and feel like the outsider trying to fit in. I fell in love a few months ago and fell on my face pretty hard. She was not emotionally ready, had just gotten through a break up, and used me as a rebound without knowing it. She also had moved a state away for college. She promised great dreams and I fell for it thinking she was perfect. I had known her for years and years and I was finally there to save her, the knight in shining armor. She is very religious and loves God but I believe she uses it the wrong way. She had sex with her ex boyfriend, is rebelling against her parents and justifies her choices by saying ""I did a lot of praying and I feel like God is leading me to do this. I'm still trying to get over her. I still think about her everyday and it hurts.

I have a new girl in my life. She is a strong Christian as well and has an amazing personality. I just don't feel strongly attracted to her physically. she is a year younger than me where the other was a year and a half older. I feel like she is a great influence in my life, but I can't stop seeing girl #1 and it is negatively affecting my relationship with girl #2. (We aren't dating, just a friendship where we both know we have feelings for each other)

I asked a girl to prom who I had a crush on, but after finding out that she slept around a lot, and that she had a long distance boyfriend I didn't know about, I felt awkward because she was pushing me to hook up with her at prom and I ended it over a month before prom. 

My friend group is very limited and I have only a few. I text a lot but never get invited to do things as I'm the odd man out who isn't part of the large friend groups. I'm extremely talkative and the class clown in school, but I feel like outside of the school I'm not liked. I don't have a lot of girls after me, and I think it's really mostly about the persona I carry.


I just recently got my first job at a cellphone store. This will cut down on my free time but will also get me out of the house and hopefully toward a car of my own.

Overall I'm just trying to figure out how, as a conservative not sure about religion and not having that many friends who also falls in love quickly and thinks too much into the whole (wife thing has to be perfect) rather than just a girlfriend...

I'm sorry that this is so long and thank whoever actually read through this whole thing. I could only think of this subreddit to come to. Here are my questions I suppose.

1. How do I turn my acquaintances into friends that want to hang out with me?

2. How should I react to my feelings on my religion? I'm all for the messages just not sure about the actual God part and how will this play into my friendships?

3. How do I go about relationships? I hold an extremely high standard and fall in love with girls who I think would make perfect wives with their personality, morals, and lastly looks. I fall in way too deep and can't get her out of my mind. How do I cope and change?

4. How can I improve my image being that I've been in High School for so long and only have a month or so left? Do I need to?

1363318933.0,11,self.relationship_tips,1abwox,"I'm (22m) going to propose to my girlfriend (21) of 7 years. How do I approach her father, who has communication troubles (see post)?",12,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1abwox/im_22m_going_to_propose_to_my_girlfriend_21_of_7/,"Reddit, I met my girlfriend in the 8th grade when she moved into our school district. She had previously lived with her abusive bipolar mother in a poorer neighborhood. Her father was fighting her mother in family court and had finally gotten majority custody. Her father is truly a good guy. He's a graphic artist and a drummer and doesn't seem to age. 

We started dating in 9th grade and now that we're graduating college I plan to propose to her before she starts graduate school. We've come a long way from where we were and I know 100% that this is the right thing to do. The only thing standing in my way right now is asking her father.

I can level with her father on some topics. He happens to be really into the 1950's and has restored most of his house from salvaged 50's appliances. I'm studying to be a computer engineer so we can connect on trying to read old, non-standard circuit diagrams. That's about the only thing we have in common though. It's also not very often that we talk about electronics, or even talk at all. 

See, he doesn't talk to most anyone besides his wife that often. I don't know exactly what to classify his social behavior as. To those he is comfortable with, he is extremely outgoing. However, he never puts more than two sentences together at a time. Trying to hold a conversation with his is a fruitless effort. He was also a Marine so he's very straight-to-the-point.

My girlfriend has formed a way of communication with him that consists mostly of body language. I've watched them do it for years and I only vaguely understand how it works. We'll be watching a movie and he'll shuffle by (they live in a 1950's ranch house). He'll reach over and ""bap"" her head. Baps are when you place one hand on someone's head and then make a ""bap"" noise by hitting your other hand onto the first. Then he'll shuffle off. From that she can understand his mood and intent. Sometimes it's turn down the volume other times it's ""be sure to wrap up by 2am"" or something. 

The final complication is that since I'm still at school I have to communicate with him over the phone. Given the timeframes for planning a surprise engagement party and getting both of our families there I need to ask him this weekend so it has to be over the phone. 

There is the matter of her step mom (basically her mom at this point), who is a very Type-A personality. We get along fine so I don't expect that to be an issue.

&gt;==.


 

OK, so sorry for the huge post, but this is basically the only thing I can think about for the last week. I needed to rant and I need advice.

* How do I make the call? Should I talk about something else first and transition to asking, or should I just call him up and get right to it?

* Should I arrange for both parents to be on the phone at the same time, or should I ask just her father?

* What do I do if he says nothing? Rejection I could handle, as this engagement is happening one way or another, but what do I do if he says nothing at all? Given how he communicates that might very well happen.

&gt;==.

**tldr;** Father has nearly autistic-level communication skills and due to party planning schedule I need to ask via a phone call this weekend. **HALP!**

**Edit:** Well Reddit, the deed is done.They were happy. They asked a lot of questions about my plans, but they were happy.

I met this guy through my friend who attends NAU. She was home where we both hang out and at her house she introduced me to 2 guys she knows that live in her dorm hall. It was the day before all 3 of them had to go back down to flagstaff to start off this spring semester and it was the day I had to say bye before my friend left. While saying bye I started talking to one of the guys at her house and as we were talking come to find out we were both going through a break up. Both him and I were dumped over winter break and talking to him and knowing he felt the way I was was a nice feeling because we talked about it and understood. That night when I was leaving I said bye to my friend and said goodbye to him and that was that. The next day he sent me a friend request in Facebook along with a message saying to text him because he enjoyed talking to me and would love to continue getting to know me. So we start texting and learning more about one another and come to find out we have so much in common it was crazy! He loves the same type of music, has the same ambitions in life, is going to school for the reasons I am, is a family man, etc. i could go on forever! He then asked if i would drive up to see him because he was dying to hang out with me in person and I wanted to see him too! So that weekend I drove up to flagstaff 2 hours away and when i arrived he was the first one I saw waiting outside for me! We went up to his dorm and I sat down at his desk and out of the blue he showed me pictures of his family and went on talking about them which i loved to hear! He then had a fraternity meeting and I left his room but before I left he gave me one of his sweatshirts so I wouldnt freeze my butt off and while leaving he said ""tomorrow I have the whole day planned for us so be here by 9"" I was so excited and just full of butterflies because no guy has ever had anything planned for us to do. That next day I pick him and gave him the keys and he drove us to this amazing little park and we acted like kids! We played on the jungle gym, we threw snow at each other and took silly pictures, it just felt amazing! (At this point I felt weird because I knew part of me was falling for him and it was weird because it was only a week since i met him) Then after the park we went to a different park where he surprised me with a picnic and we talked and went on just about random stuff and I loved it because there was never an awkward moment! Later that day we went back to his dorm and laid in his bed just being lazy and watched movies the rest of the day! It was amazingly perfect. That night I was supposed to head back home for work the next morning but he convinced me to stay and I did and we shared an amazing kiss. I then surprised him the next day with donuts in bed and he looked so cute cuddled in my blanket :) I left and while leaving he kept begging me to stay but I knew I couldnt because of my job and school. We then continued on texting and he kept saying that I shouldve let him keep my blanket and to surprise him i sent it to him priority shipping so he could have it the next day! but then after a week it got weird. I had the opportunity to meet go up to flagstaff to see him and he said come but wouldnt have time to see me. I didnt go because all i wanted was to see him and then a week later I drive up there and go up to his dorm with my friend and all he does is look at me and say ""Hey"" no hug or anything...Now its been about a month since I have heard from him and I finally left him alone...i sent him a message saying i liked him and didnt wanna lose him as a friend and since I sent it I still havent heard from him. Its just so confusing because he was so perfect and now I dont know if I should forget about him and everything he is or keep trying...Im going back to flagstaff this weekend for orientation and I want to see him but I feel that if i even try to contact him he wont respond...

In my earlier days, and in the years leading up to dating my current boyfriend, I was the type of person who very much fed off the of heightened giddy-ness of being around someone you really like. Even when my boyfriend and I first started dating, I know I went through a honeymoon stage where everything was absolutely perfect as long as we were together, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, yada yada.

Obviously, and naturally, this wore off soon enough and after five years of dating, there are no butterflies left. We have dealt with a lot and gone through a lot. We're both full time students and relatively poor. Whenever he comes over, there is no more initially flutter.

For a while, and I think normally, I've been attracted to situations that give me that anxious happiness. I have not been flirting around or anything, but I do daydream. My boyfriend is a very good fit for me, and in a lot of ways the only person who can deal with me, but there is no more emotional compulsion for me to be with him. And don't get me wrong, I love him to pieces, but it's a very different kind of love than it was.

Valentines Day is right around the corner, and because of schedules and homework, we probably won't be able to celebrate for a few weeks. We're not even long-distance, we're just busy students. As cliche as it sounds, I feel like that our relationship just lacks some sort of ""magic"" and it has for a long time.

He is almost a decade older than me, which in itself isn't a big deal, seeing is there are large age ranges in universities. However, lately he keeps hitting on me and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. When I walk into a room, or even just stand up, he full-body checks me out in the most non-discrete way possible. He subtly sneaks in ""is it hot in here, or is it just you"" lines into every day smal talk, is constantly talking like he's known me for ages, when in reality it's been like 3 months, puts words in my mouth making me sound way less flawed than I actually am, and practically puts me on a pedestal right in front of me... A couple days ago he was eating mexican food and looked at me and said, ""doesn't my big meaty burrito look delicious?"" I got pretty pissed, and said ""excuse me?!"" in a rude tone, and he changed what he said. But here is the worst one: my boyfriend is in a band, and was opening for a pretty well known artist in the indie scene, and I was really proud of him, so I was telling EVERYONE about this show. I remember telling my friend about it and he specifically said he had never heard of any of the bands. No big deal, right? Well a little bit ago we were talking and somehow that show gets brought up and he starts telling me these stories of how he was there and saw a bunch of people he knew there. When I was like, dude why would you go to a show for a band you've never heard of"", he recanted with a fake puzzled look on his face, and told me they'd been one of his favorite bands for years. So essentially he drove roughly three hours to a show that meant nothing to him, to be at the same place my boyfriend and I were at.  

I have NO idea how to tell him i'm pretty fucking creeped out by him, and not at all interested without ruining the friendship (which I would prefer to keep, because aside from what I've written, he's pretty cool).

I've talked to my friends about this, and they pretty much unanimously stated that I should come out as a lesbian to him, which is no help. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so I told him I had to cancel our hang out because I was gonna go chill with my boyfriend instead, trying to show him my priorities, and that only made things worse.

My boyfriend is very close to his family. He lives at home with his parents, 98 year old grandmother, and 30 something year old brother. When he’s not working or hanging out with friends he’s at home. Even when we can find time for one another we don’t go to my apartment, we go to his family’s house. If I suggest we go to my place he gets hesitant or says he has a project he needs to work on or his dad needs a ride to work. If I say I feel uncomfortable having dinner with his family twice a week he’ll say, “Darling, don’t be silly. They love having you over!” 

I have a dysfunctional and emotionally draining family so I think it’s great they get along so very well. But how does one start a life with someone already so attached? Do you try hard to contribute to their unit? Do you request boundaries and ask your SO to pull away? 

We have had this discussion more than once but have yet to find a middle ground. I’m wondering what others have done in this situation, if a compromised was reached, and if it worked out in the long run.

Thanks for sharing.

Our relationship is amazing. We rarely fight (when we do we talk it through), our sex life is awesome, we have loads of fun together and we are fully committed to each other and trust one another.      
     
The problem is that since we've moved in together, we've both become lazier, more complacent, disorganized and basically a mess.  We work at the same company and have a very demanding work schedule. The few hours we have in the evenings we tend to ALWAYS spend together.  We really really are enjoying each other (we were in an LDR before living together) but this has led us to neglect all other aspects of our life (except work).   
     
Examples:    
- We have both gained a bunch of weight    
- Neither of us have much of a social life anymore   
- Our house is always a mess, the bills are late, the car needs maintenance   
- We don't seem to have hobbies anymore   
- We can't seem to set and meet ANY goals    
    
Last night when all of this sort of dawned on me we had a major discussion, and we both agree that this is something we need to work on right away.    

Questions:     
- Is this relatively normal in the early stages of a relationship?    
- Can you suggest any specific strategies for us to ""grow"" out of this funk and into responsible adulthood?

It may sound a little juvenile, but even when we kiss it feels a little ""icky"" to me. Due to all of this, I've started to get the feeling that we may not be physically compatible (if there is such a thing). Perhaps we are both simply inexperienced, but I'm afraid that when the time comes for us to have sex, I may not like it and it may affect our relationship.

So we break up, and over the past 4 months have dated, and I have really become very convicted and confident in the belief that I found my perfect match in him and may have just squandered the love of my life (gained said independence and independent social lives on our own in the meantime). He, on the other hand, did a total 180 from his original sadness back when I first moved out. I told him I knew we were for each other ultimately and wanted to get back together, and he told me that he's not ready/in the mindset to be in a relationship right now, and that he doesn't want to do the wrong thing by getting back with me before he's ready.

Sigh. I know exactly what this is - the early 20s male epidemic of anti-relationship-mentality (not generalizing all, just many!) that tends to send males 20-25 towards hook ups and casual dating and away from forging serious bonds. I understand his new social life and dating life has made him realize he just doesn't want to be in a ""tied down"" relationship, and i'm aware he's sleeping with other women and very successful out on the dating scene (he's got great game - very confident, social, hilarious). He tells me that when he sleeps with other girls it means nothing to him emotionally, but says that we need to not sleep together (we have a few times since), because it makes him too mushy and emotional inside (and apparently that's something to be avoided during this stage of independence?). 

Well I am definitely out on the scene and dating, so I'm not sulking at home, but he is always there in my mind and I have this burning hope that he won't find someone else and then in a year or years down the line when the timing is right for his maturity, we can reunite and end up together.

**My question is** - Has anyone been in a situation where you parted ways with the love of your life because of timing issues, and successfully got back with this ex later when you were both ready to commit? if so, what is your advice on how to go about communication during the time in between to maximize the chances of a future relationship? - Best to continue to hang out and enjoy each other's positive qualities as well as stay in each other's minds while we are not exclusive?

I am a 13 year old girl with an EXTREME crush on my 29 year old female band director. She has been the last thing I've thought about before falling asleep and the first thing I've thought about after waking up for 7 months. I need advice. I can't stop thinking about her and try to make myself closer to her. I have kept track of all the times that I can see her in the halls; I dress extra-nice on the days I will see her for stage crew or marching band; I'm taking a taking concert band over a study hall next semester just so I can see her every day; I joined marching band, jazz band, and stage crew to be closer to her. She isn't the kind of teacher that everyone likes, either. She is quiet and awkward, but I feel a special connection with her because I see myself in her. She makes deep, double-meaning jokes that usually only I understand. She also graduated valedictorian of our high school in 2001. I, too, am intelligent; I skipped a grade in elementary school. We can have steady conversations if we can get them started... which doesn't usually happen. Whenever I had to leave band practice early for volleyball games, she always told me good luck, which she didn't do to the volleyball players last year. (There were about 7 volleyball players in the band last year, but I am the only one this year.) I also feel like she goes out of her way to help me, to look after me. ex, we had a special maneuver in marching band for senior night that was uncomfortable for me when i went down on one knee. She switched my ""half"" of the field (which really wasn't half) to the knee I wanted and kept the other half the same. Note that our marching band is tiny, only about 40 people with the fronts and managers.

She is unmarried and childless, but I can't tell if she is lesbian or bisexual like I am. She probably doesn't know I am either; she knows that I have had two boyfriends since I entered the high school, but no girlfriends. I don't want a boy/girl friend, either. I know she is probably a lost cause, but I am really saving my heart for her.
Since I skipped a grade, I will be 17 when I graduate. I was thinking of telling her then, but that could cause problems. I intend to tell her eventually, but I don't know when it would be best. Since she is the marching band director, I could attend a football game and ask for a moment alone, but I will still be 17 during the football season after I graduate.

Then there's the possibility that I do tell her on the night of my graduation and she says she likes me back. Wouldn't it be a bit straightforward of me to impose a 4-6 year romantic hiatus on someone who may not like me as much as I like them? If she says she'll wait, then what? It would make my life to be with her for the rest of our lives. But, we live in Pennsylvania, where gay marriage is currently outlawed. That could change, but I don't know.

AND THEN there's the fact that student-teacher relationships are kind of illegal. I'm not stupid enough to act on my crush right now, but even FORMER student-teacher relationships are sorta frowned upon.

He has apparently told his dad, sister, coworkers, and best friends about me. To make things even better, he is a genuinely sweet and charming person, and a total gentleman.

As he was sleeping next to me, I found out about all the other girls he’s talking to.
There’s at least three, and he is apparently saying things like “I cant wait to see you” and “I want to squeeze you and kiss you.” With lots of winky faces. 
Now, we’ve only hung out twice due to long distance, but we text every day. Lately his texts have started getting repetitive and less frequent, and he always comes up with excuses as to why he wasn’t texting back for so long. 

So, my questions is: Is it even right for me to get mad about these other girls, since we aren’t even in a relationship? And I really like this guy, but he’s obviously playing me.

My boyfriend (28) and I (f,22) came together in early 2010 after just 3-4 months of knowing each other and to be honest we had a pretty bad start. He approached our relationship at first making sure all of his concerns were made clear, like going away with friends in the evening, partying in general, or others seeing too much of my cleavage.
He had many problems with earlier girlfriends like dealing with jealousy and controlling, so to be fair he tried to have a positive beginning by talking with me about this, while even trying to trust me and not forbidding me anything. 
I tried to respect his concerns and did not go out with friends anymore, what made me quite unhappy because I felt like I lost connection to them since they do a lot of connection during the evenings and not our lectures at the university. They began to ask me less and less if I wanted to go with them. 

After my exams for that semester we had a party going in our university department, and I stayed for some barbecue, since exams had been exhausting. My bf was fine with it, but me drinking too much ended up being intoxicated, and sleeping at a fellow student's bed after he offered help. Although we did nothing, my bf was furious (what i seriously understand), and sais it was like cheating to him, because it 'could' have happened something.

After this incident everything changed. I totally understood his hatred on me, and tried to make clear that I never intended to hurt him or ignore his feelings, that it was a mistake of mine to underestimate the alcohol. I felt so sorry about it and apologized, but he was so angry we nearly broke up. But then he offered some kind of 'contract' to me, of which I wonder until today if accepting to that could've been the bigger mistake of mine.
He suggested he could change his mind, seeing me positively again, and at the end even like me again (until we can start to have a real relationship again), if I could accept him being all rude and taking his hatred and his moods out on me whenever he wants, and as long as he needs. He was sure about being able to see me with other eyes again after he could just have his time calming down in his own way. Even though I knew it would never be the right way to deal with a problem to act this way, I agreed to his concept because he would not let me talk him towards alternatives or other options. Either his plan was followed, or separation, so I agreed to it, not wanting to give up on us yet without having tried everything I could.

He justified it by saying he needs a situation where he has the complete control of me since he did not trust me anymore, and a time to cool down all the anger. His hatred for me was nothing he could/wanted to fight down actively since he did not even want to be with me anymore, even if he offered the conctract as a long-term way to get over it. He said he knows I am a person that has all the fundamentals, so he is positive about a relationship with me, but since he hates me after that, he does not want to be in the position to approach me, and do anything to influence his naturally developed feelings.

Since then followed more than a year of bad moods, constant fighting over anything, him being totally irrational about things, arguing unlogical, and treating me like I have no right to speak up at all. It was so bad he would be angry at the tiniest things like me standing in his way, or passing him a can the wrong way. It was not like I would totally back down, I tried to be not treated too badly, but in his opinion, he was totally justified treating me like he wanted. He was even angry at me for having confirmed his contract in the beginning and not completely following it afterwards.

One year passed and then another, a lot of ugly things happened. And during that time we developed some attitudes towards the other, like serious trust-issues that make it hard to have a normal relationship. 

We always argue a lot, and it kind of developed from arguing about actual problems between us to discuss the way we discuss. Today we are in the situation that we hate the other's way of arguing, and our day-long discussions are more on a meta-level of arguing over stuff, arguing itself, (not) showing respect, etc.
(As one example: issues like porn have always been a big deal;not showing respect for my feelings or lying to me lead to me feeling disrespected and ignored, not worth it for him to approach me, especially when he put the importance of it above me.)

Our relationship developed constantly over the time, and today I finally get the impression, that he mainly got over it, begins to like me again, and that he behaves nicer than before (except for during conflicts). He also thinks his plan is finally working, and it only needed so long for developing, because we constantly fought during the years, that he could never really develop any positive feelings for me. He would have needed me to completely follow his instructions, and not let fights happen even if I was unhappy. He could only develop a positive attitude if there was some time constantly positive between us. 

So now it seems there has enough time passed that his feelings naturally changed, but my problem is, that I do not know if I really can start seeing him in a new way, because I got to know him over the years as such a bad, unappealing, angry person I do not trust, so I am not sure yet, if he really changed and let his behavior behind. All the time I rethink if he lies to me, has an agenda. He admits today that he behaved badly, and that his attitude towards me has been more affected than he thought it would be. But I am not sure that he really understands through what horrible time he put me through, and that it may have been the wrong way to work on our (his?) problem. Every time I mention that I disagreed to our 'contract' from beginning on, and that I may think it wasn't right, he defends it as the only right way to deal with his trust-issue, and that his attitude was as natural as it could be, so there was no way to handle it differently. 

I tried to make him realize how this time destroyed my appreciation of him. But he blames me for not having an objective view on him, for being still influenced by my feelings a year ago, that he was a different person under an influence and I should see that. But I am not sure if he actually IS a different person without an impact like that.
But my problem is, that I do not know if I can be with a guy who defends such a behavior, no matter what reasons he comes up with. Who really remains of the conviction, he has been right and there is no doubt about it. I Feel like I am with a lunatic. I even come up with the idea, he might use the original incident as an excuse to behave this way since it gave him all the control. 

So I wonder about Reddits opinion of my conclusions. Was it the right way to deal with the feeling the other cheated on him? What would you have suggested, what should we have done differently? Is it possible for a relationship to get over something like this? Any advice how we could work on our relationship better from now on?
Any productive comment and advice will be appreciated.

Edit:
Thanks so much for your answers so far. And sorry that it took so long for me to respond, I am stressed a lot lately.

1339659048.0,10,self.relationship_tips,v1cdi,I feel like my GF(19) and I are drifting apart.,13,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/v1cdi/i_feel_like_my_gf19_and_i_are_drifting_apart/,"I am 20(Male) and we have been together for well over a year now. She has really been my only true GF as I was not the most loved in high school. Ive done things that any previous BF of hers could say they have not. She has gone through many problems in the year I have been with her, to being molested to being practically kicked out of her house. I have always stood by her side. All I want is for her to be happy.

Recently, we got back from a trip and ever since then things have been completely different. In the year and some months we have been together, we have probably spent over 350 days together(or at least seen each other.) We would spend our time either at the malls, seeing movies, going to the beach or just hang out. We always had problems figuring out what we were going to do. If we ever did, we would just meet each other at one anothers house. Recently though, that has not become an option.

Why has it not become an option? Because my GF seems to have fallen to an addiction to a social networking site. She does not work during the day most times, she sits at home and sits at the computer all day. When I am with her, we will sit there and she will be on her phone on the website. Rather then talk to me, she sits on her phone. She spends all her time on said website. 

She never offers up her house as an option to do stuff anymore, nor any options at all really. To me, it seems like she would rather spend time with her social site then spend time with me. I honestly feel like I am being replaced by a social networking site. She talks a lot less then she used too, which is hard cause she is a very talkative person. It almost seems as if I have done something wrong. Sometimes, she even tells me to go watch TV in a separate area so that she can have some time on the computer alone and that she doesn't want me to sit by her cause it would be ""awkward."" Back when we first started going out, her parents would tell me I had to leave around 10pm so that I wouldn't disrupt there sleep(they both work super early). That did not matter to her though, I would almost always stay till 11 or so. Now, I am leaving at 10 cause her parents say so. She makes sure that I leave right after 10. She claims she does not want to get in trouble but she does not care to be in trouble by her parents, or at least she didn't. Again, it seems as if I have done something wrong.

She is constantly lieing to me as well. I have a little bit of knowledge has to how to find some things on the internet and I found her page on the social networking site that she is constantly on. The last couple of weeks she has been saying she is going to sleep, so I say all the usual goodnight stuff. Then, I wake up the next morning to find out that she was still on her page 2 hours after she was supposed to be sleeping. It seems as if she would just pretend to sleep rather then talk to me so that she could go on her website. Also, not to long ago, we were at her relatives house and she was on her phone browsing her favorite site again. Then, I saw her log out and log back in with the regular email address she uses. I question her if she has two accounts, she says ""No."" and gives me this story about how it always freezes and logs her out after waiting a while so she just logs out herself so she doesn't have to wait. At the time, it seemed like a legitimate thing. Then, I see her signing in with a completely different email then her regular. I remember this email and sure enough, she had another account. She had lied. The account had linked to a separate role playing time profile. Basically, she was pretending to be a character from a movie. I know it may not seem like a big thing, but I just hate being lied too.

My next issue. Her addiction to the social networking site basically consists of her sitting on her phone all day looking at men she finds super attractive or pretending to be those men on a separate account. Basically, she just posts all day about how attractive this one particular guy is. And, although he is a celebrity it really grinds my gears. Especially, when she is constantly talking about him with me. Ive always been the jealous type. She says things like ""Have my babies"" ""Just marry me already"" ""Im your future wife"" ""I want you to take baths with me"" and the most killer of all """"Just have sex with me already"" These are things she used to say to me. 

The main reason why I feel like I am being replaced and why we are growing farther apart is because it seems like she no longer loves me. She says the words ""I love you"" but at times they seem empty and meaningless. She no longer does the things with me that she used too. Any time we were at her house, we would probably be doing something inappropriate, fooling around, or whatever. Now, she hardly even gives me hugs. When I leave her house at night, she kisses me but they much like the words I love you, feeling meaningless. Any time we fool around, I generally have to do all the work. She hardly touches me. She only does so if I tease her where as usually she just does it. 

Also, as we are growing farther apart, I seem to be taking interest in other women. Ones that will actually give me the time of day and not just sit on there phone and drool over a celebrity.

All these reasons, have left me feeling like I should break if off. There is one problem though, even though she has seemed to have lost interest quite substantially, I keep replaying in my head what would happen if I was to break up with her. As mentioned at the start, she has gone through quite a bit of problems in the year I have been dating her. Before our trip, it really hit her hard. She would wake up many days and just not be happy. She couldn't figure out for the life of her, why. After almost all of her incidents, she never chose to pursue any help except for one time, which she only did cause she was forced too. I think she has some sort of depression but I told her no matter what I would still love her. She still to this day refuses help, no matter how much I try and convince her. And, I feel like if I was to break it off, she would be pushed over the edge. Even if she has lost interest. I don't want to be responsible for her hurting herself. So I have kinda locked myself into this as well.

I need help. I need help with my relationship. I'm hoping that it will fade off but it has been almost a month now and nothing is changing. Has it sailed its course?

**tl;dr** My gf seems to have lost interest in me. I believe its cause of a social networking site. She posts things about a celebrity that she used to say to me. No longer does affectionate things with me. Prefers time with website then with me.  She does no work in ""fooling around."" I feel as if she no longer loves me, she says ""i love you"" etc. etc. but they seem empty. I have been taking up interest in other women because GF lacks it in me. Not sure if I should break up or what I should do. Also, GF seems depressed at times and if I break up I am scared of the repercussions on her life that she might take out on herself and I would feel terribly guilty. **Need help.**",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_v1cdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/v1cdi/i_feel_like_my_gf19_and_i_are_drifting_apart/,

I want to do something special for her while I'm there. I like the thought of leaving things behind somewhere for her to find after I'm gone.

Things I've done so far:

Bought 5 cards, wrote something special in each of them. Left them around the city at some of her favorite places. Each week for the next 5 weeks I would tell her where to go and ask for a new card. She loved that idea except for the ones that were hard to get to. I think she is kind of lazy... But she loved getting something from me even though I wasn't there.

Left a message in a dictionary at the Barnes thats closest to her. I figured no one would buy a dictionary these days and it would be a good place to leave a note. It was just a sticky note with I love you on it under the L's (for obvious reasons). Every time I am in NYC I'm going to leave a note in that dictionary for her to get whenever she starts missing me a lot. That's something I plan on doing from now on (until she moves her job anyway then I'll find a new spot).

I setup an easter egg hunt for her on easter morning, just got up super early, snuck out of her place to set everything up. She loved it (except she was grumpy to get up early).
Mailed a Valentines day card for her to a friend and had him hide it in the city. It was encoded with a link to a website that she had to visit to decode the message. It sounds like a lot of work but it was really cute. I was trying to make her say ""how the fuck did he even get the card up here?!"" I don't think I'm going to do much of these hidden around the city things much more though because I don't think she enjoys the treasure hunt as much as I do.

Back in October I could tell that something was different with her. She never really wanted to talk about it and kept telling me everything was okay. I then found out she was having an emotional affair with another man. We talked about it, I forgave her and we made up. 

Things seemed to be getting better when one day she told me she was leaving, was going to go live with her grandparents. This was out of the blue for me since I thought we were good as our intimacy was better than it had been in a long time.  

Now we are in April. She actually moved back in at the beginning of the month. This is after many moments of her wanting to be together( sometimes even ""dating"" for a month or so) and then wanting to be apart. We have both been to much therapy together and on our own. Last week she said she felt she needed to leave. 

Right now my wife is also dealing with bulimia. I did not know about it earlier than a month and a half ago and she did not accept it until then either. The therapist we have seen together said that my wife dissociates, to further that, depersonalization disorder. But the counselor my wife has seen a couple of times now on her own says she doesn't do this. Confuse us more please. Another thing is that my wife has always been terrified that she would be ""sick"" or ""crazy"" because it does run in her family. I don't think that she is these things.  

So last week after a visit to her eating disorder counselor she came home and said she wanted to leave. I don't get angry or confrontational in these moments because I know this wouldn't help her ""flight"" feeling. I am patient and understanding and keep telling her and showing her that I am here for her. By the end of the week things were good with her telling me she feels safe with me and that I truly am the man for her. I had a very troubled childhood and she keeps calling me ""My lotus flower"" for everything I have made it through and what I have become.

Everything was going great yesterday, she was sending me texts saying thanks for leaving her a note in the morning saying, "" Stay positive, today is another day."" And texts saying that she loves me. Fast forward to when I get home from work, after she has seen the bulimia counselor again, my wife is back to saying she wants to leave. Unfortunately I was not able to be strong this time and I broke down. I cried. I am hurt, I am extremely exhausted and I don't know if I am grasping onto something that just might not be there. She says she knows I'm a great guy and that I probably am good for her, but she doesn't know if she can be good for me, or be her with me. She feels she either has to put herself full on into ""Us"" or she can't do anything at all. She likes her extremes.

A couple of weeks ago, I had approached him about possibly taking our FWB to a monogamous relationship. He didn't say no outright, but I could tell he was somewhat uncomfortable with the question. We talked it over, and although I was somewhat hurt in the beginning, I respected him and we went back to FWB status. Originally, I had been the one to tell him that I wasn't looking for anything too serious two months prior. I just got out of 1.5 year relationship and didn't want to dive into anything too quickly. But since then, we have spent basically every day with one another, either partying or just laying around the house having amazing sex. Although we are just FWB, I haven't been with anyone else sexually and haven't had any thoughts otherwise towards anyone else, and to my knowledge neither has he.

After I read his post about open relationships, I was curious. I had thought about pursuing an open relationship before this, and was willing to give it a shot. We set rules (no ex's, don't ask don't tell, and we aren't allowed to take the other persons phone number etc.), talked about how we felt about everything (on our way to the bookstore to buy The Ethical Slut, which was recommended in the comments of the post), and now we're together.

We're long-distance-ish, and we both live at home for the time being. When we visit each other, we sleep in separate beds. Over the summer I was away, and we went camping whenever he visited me, but I just realized that being back is going to create a bit of a strain when it comes to feeling physically intimate. 

Currently we just kind of do what we can, when we can [if we're coming home late, we'll park somewhere and have at-it... luckily he lives in the country with lots of unoccupied back-roads], but I really enjoy the slow, work-up-to-it kind of foreplay and loving that I'm finding we can only really get when sleeping in the same bed together without risk of being caught. Plus it's not just the sex, I would like to cuddle and just play around, lay naked, etc... I love his mum, but she's always asking him to do things so we don't really have lots of time alone until later at night. 

We did go to a bed and breakfast for our anniversary back in May when I was still living at home, but it's just not practical money-wise to do so right now.

Nobody really interests me and I have vague idea what I would look for. A while ago I was about to let someone know I like them. The other side of my brain though kicked in and went, ""Hey wait! What are you doing and why? Don't do anything stupid."" so I stopped and thought of, why? Why is it there is a need for relationships? I went to the go to man, my dad, and asked this question. His answer was mediocre to me as he just keep repeating ""connection."" Yeah, I get it, we want connection, but why a RELATIONSHIP devoted to one person? The go to man just repeated ""connection"" then we went to watch The Great Gatsby, that was interesting. So I thought for a while and got nothing, but more jumbled questions. I couldnt think of any sufficient answers myself so after a long day of tests, I went to the Internet. (I was half tired too and made a video...I kind of regret that, but the replies I got helped.) I tried to make a video on the subject. My idea got across and I got several replies. Some are in it for the sex, we are hardwired for that. Some are in it for connection. The reply that changed my view was that it was find a person to help you be a better person and somebody you can communicate and have teamwork with. 

So here are the levels of a relationship (I'm kinda bullshitting is part as I go)

1.) connection - you find a person you can connect with share experiences together

2.) relationship (eh, bullshitting and too lazy to think of a better word) - it is more then a connection, it is just is second level of love, you know they are your significant other 

3.) sex (might somewhat depend, for some it's just recreation) - you're comfortable enough around this person (by god I fucking hope so) to open up a level of vulnerability, yourself. (Ha get it?) You don't just sleep naked with anybody, (or at least I hope not.) 

4.) teamwork, makes you a better person - the person can help you at the drop of a hat, they care for you. You help them, they help you. You get the other three levels mixed in and you got a great relationship. You are made a better person by them. You teach each other and share great experiences, pool together money to go to the opera house or football game. They aren't there just for a connection (dude, I like volleyball too we should date!) or to have somebody to make them feel loved (I told you I had a girlfriend, see?) or for the rush of sex (glorified fuck buddies). This person is there to care for you as much as you re them. They say there is a lot of fish in the sea, but the right fish is difficult to spot. 

(My inexperienced opinion here)
If this doesn't last forever, it is ok. Did you have a great relationship before it died off? Did you have fun? Did you learn something? Did you become a better person? Did you help them become a better person? Then you got something out of that relationship. (I have yet to have a break up on bad terms though to offer a different view.) 

I was going to go back and edit this, but since I wrote it as I thought it I think I will leave it unedited or filtered. 

So now when I am looking for someone to be in a relationship with, I look for more then just a connection and being able to say I am in a relationship. I want somebody who I can help, who can help me. Someone where we both will make ourselves a better person. Someone I can open up to, someone to listen, care, give advice. Some who I don't quarrel with and together we are a team. That's a relationship. It's not male or female young or old. It's two people who make a team that don't want to break up. 

There is a lot of really cool people out there, but for now I want to make myself a better person, so I can help them. For now I can't be a team player, I need to focus on me. Be me. I need to learn more of the ropes, learn more skills, and learn about myself.

I try not to get mad when she doesn't know what's wrong, I get that sometimes things just feel ""wrong.""

For her, this seems to work, and to her credit she comes back down very quickly when it happens and apologises ""for being a stinker."" It's just inevitable with the stresses of modern life.

So ladies, what can/does your man do to communicate reassurance and love you when you're freaking out a bit? I'm interested to see if there's a common denomenator in the communication somewhere.

1369113047.0,8,self.relationship_tips,1eqwu2,[21f] My bf [22m] is great at handling serious issues but weirdly unapproachable with smaller stuff.. What's going on??,10,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1eqwu2/21f_my_bf_22m_is_great_at_handling_serious_issues/,"We've been dating for just over two years and I really don't have too much to complain about. He's sweet, silly and very clearly loves the hell out of me (and I love him just as much). We are both faithful and honest people by nature - dating and otherwise - and have a similar sense of humor, etc., etc.

This is a weird issue for me. It's lots of little things adding up.. I guess an overarching theme is that he's not good at treating me like a gf instead of a friend? We were friends for a couple years before we started dating, so maybe that made the transition weird. He also dated his first gf for 5 years until college and then we started dating right away, so he may just have kinks to work out with casual dating.

It's stuff like:

* **giving me grief if I ask him to pick up a tab.** I work hard to pay for 50% of things so this is rare, but he's got a stronger financial situation and sometimes I can't afford to pay for my own meal on a date

* **not asking me about my day.** For example, I'm out of town looking at apartments in a brand new state where I'll be living during a 6-year Ph.D. program and he knows this, but he hasn't asked me once how things are going..? (We have both established confidently that we are staying together long-distance so that's not the issue.) He's said in the past that when people ask him questions about himself (ex. ""How are you?""), he specifically doesn't ask the question back because he knows they're ""fishing for a chance to talk"" and that they should just say up front if they have something to talk about. I'm not unreasonable for thinking that's ridiculous, right? Especially when it comes to something like this huge transition in my life??

* **he's happy to hang out at his place but never seems to want to come over to mine.** That was the case over the last two years when we were attending the same university, and is still true now while we're an hour apart. He lives in the same town as a lot of our shared friends from college and says it makes more sense for me to make the drive because of that, but it costs me a lot of money and frankly I'm sick of making the effort if he's not going to reciprocate..

But weirdly, he handles serious issues extraordinarily well. He suddenly becomes a master communicator (ex. ""Before we talk about [thing that's bothering him], is there something else bothering you? Are you stressed out about something?"" ""I understand where you're coming from but there's no need to take it out on me. We're on the same side."") and is an amazing listener - not always the case when I'm talking to him day-to-day..

I just have no idea why this is happening. Overall, I'm very happy, but I could see my frustrations turning into resentment in a couple years. That's the last thing I want - I really like this guy and want to make it last.

Reddit, help me out: how can I bring this up to him without referencing one tiny example and seeming irrational? Is there something I'm doing to cause this that I can change?

**tl;dr:** Bf is not great at casual romantic relationship day-to-day stuff but is amazing when the going gets tough. Overall, we click and I want this to work. How can I get him to show more effort with the little things without sounding crazy?

We've been dating for 3.5 years now. My girlfriend has a younger sister who is 18 and about to start college. My family is pretty well off, but my girlfriend's mom is struggling to pay the bills (they nearly got evicted at the beginning of the month). My girlfriend lives frugally, has an old car, and works 15-20 hours per week in addition to being a full-time student.

Her sister, on the other hand, has always been spoiled. She drives an expensive new car (which she got after she totaled her old one), has terrible grades, doesn't work, and is, to put it bluntly, bitchy. She's 18 years old, and she throws temper tantrums like a 6 year old; and the worst part is, her mom always gives in! I swear, she's never heard the word ""no"" in her life. After getting rejected from a few lower-tier public schools (with 60-70% acceptance rates), she got one acceptance letter from a *very* expensive in-state school (tuition+housing around $45-50k per year). Of course, my girlfriend and I thought this meant that she would be going to community college for a year or two.

My girlfriend and I just finished up the semester, and came home to find out that her sister plans on going to this expensive school in the fall, and her mother is going to take out a loan to pay for it (again, $175-200k over 4 years, not to mention the fact that my girlfriend already has student loans to pay off). She absolutely refuses to go to a community college for even for a year or two because, and I quote, ""That's where stupid people go. And the campus isn't pretty enough.""

I'm guessing that nobody can really give me a good answer, but I'm stuck in the typical ""I want to ask her out but don't want to make things awkward."" I've spoken with her a few times and I felt that she may have been interested in me, but I wasn't sure (based on her asking me if I'm going to the bar and other 1 on 1 conversations we've had).

I was at a party with her, and we were getting along well, she laughs a lot with me and put her arm around me at one point. To be fair, it seemed like she may just be very friendly with lots of guys. Later on in the night, I asked if she wanted to sit outside and check for Aurora Borealis again, and she said ""Nah, it's still too cloudy, we can't see it."" I took this as a ""no, I'm not interested in you.""

But then later she asked for my number, and afterward did not recall doing so (she was quite drunk and had smoked a bit, so possibly high). After this, I thought I may still be in the game, so I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner with me sometime (probably not a good time), and she said something about food and then said ""let's go to the kitchen and get food.""

She couldn't find her shoes (can't tell if this was another subtle rejection or I'm reading into things), and eventually we got distracted.

I really have no idea how to handle this and I've overanalyzed the situation now. Am I done for? Should I try asking her out now that we're sober, or maybe ask her to something really casual (we both play frisbee, maybe just hang out and throw, flirt with her?).

When I was in high school, like most boys, I wanted a girlfriend.  I was so desperate and eager to get one, in fact, that I probably scared off most of the girls I met in high school. For whatever reason, I didn't meet anyone special growing up really until about a week after I graduated high school.  She is a Redditor so I'm gonna keep the details to a minimum (even though it's pretty unlikely she will ever see this/connect the dots) but one day she just kind of showed up, and we hit it off almost immediately.  This was in June following High School graduation, and she had just moved to my neighborhood for the summer before she was shipping off as well (you can probably see where this is going).  I can't really adequately describe how incredible it was to be with her in a reddit post.  She was the first person (aside from a few very close guy friends) to ever just accept me for who I was.  My chest is starting to tighten up a bit reliving the time I spent with her as I'm typing this up.  We spent all the time together that we could, it didn't matter what we did or where we went, we just clicked like we'd known each other for years. And the sex. Oh my god the sex. We were both each others first, and even after all this time, I haven't found anyone who can come close to matching the physical and emotional intimacy that I felt with her.  We went off to school in different parts of North America, and kept in touch for the first year or so before it became apparent that after a whole year we still felt very strongly about each other.  I tried to make the longing stop and told her we needed to put it on ice, but 8 months later I came crawling back and confessed to her that I still could not stop thinking about her.  However, I suspect she had already put her feelings for me behind her.  It's been 3 years since we first met and still can't stop comparing her to every girl I go on a date with, and almost no one has come close to being as incredible as her.

She had her reasons for that, and I had mine. One of mine, and I think it's one of the big ones for me, is that I never connected with her via meaningful sex (all she ever performed was duty sex because she disliked sex for one reason or another). She thinks that is ridiculous, and that sex should not be necessary for you to love someone on a higher level.

So, my question is this: For some people to move forward in a relationship in a meaningful way, is it possible that they need to be able to connect with their partner with sex for this to happen, or is sex unnecessary for a relationship to advance in maturity levels to new and more intimate/meaningful (on every level, not just sex) places?

Thanks for the answers. I'm just trying to determine if the way I feel about this is something that needs to change in order for me to have a successful relationship, or if this is normal and that is just her perspective on things, which isn't necessarily wrong, just different than mine.

Story behind the question inside, definitely want answers!!",12,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/18qj16/xpost_from_rrelationships_serious_question_how/,"Ok so lengthy title, I know. But the reason I(F22) ask is because about 2 years ago, my boyfriend(M27, we were together 3 years roundabouts) at the time attempted to cheat on me via Craigslist ads with nasty looking women. I mean like the worst of the worst. I ended up forgiving him because he promised he would never do it again, and frankly I'm a complete sucker for this guy. So then about 8 months ago, I caught him at it again. It ripped my heart in two, and it still hurts that he did it. I finally broke up with him for good, although I have tried to remain friends and we are very close. I've tried asking him why he did it, and he doesnt have an answer. Not helpful in the least, and although I know it is not my fault, as you can all imagine, it did a number for my feeling of self-doubt. Was it something I did, did I drive him to do this, yadda yadda.


So fast forward to last week, and I get a call from my best friend(F22). She tell me her boyfriend(M25/26?) got caught up doing the same thing to her. Craigslist, POF, the whole thing. Talking to some raunchy girls. They've been together 3 years.


We've both talked to several male friends of ours, and have found that sometimes, they too, have done this kind of shit behind their girlfriends backs. My friend and I are avid redditors, and I asked her if we should make a throwaway, as we are now completely convinced that a great majority of men pull this stunt. My other closest friend is gay(M22) and his ex (M24) did the same to him!
So basically, guys and gals, what the hell? If you've ever done this to someone, can you explain why you did it? Or if this has happened to you, know that you arent alone! We are just looking for answers, and would like some insight.

I was drunk, I remember me just talking to these girls, none of them touching up on me. I kept apologizing saying I'm sorry and it was just a fuck up, told her how much she meant to me and I didn't want to lose her to this.

My issue is, I don't really know how to be an actual ""girlfriend"". I want to do things like bring things over and cook for him, but I don't want to over step any boundaries since we've only been together for a short time.

I'm British and studying a course that I don't like (currently living in Japan), and I will be coming home relatively soon (month or less) and dropping out of the course.

Because of expensive tuition fee's in the UK, I want to go to be with my Girlfriend in Denmark (free tuition for EU residents), and live with her for the time being. **This is not a permanent decision**. I want to study in Denmark, yet in order to get all the financial security I will need to work for a while first.

Once I've had a job for long enough I am entitled to Danish student support money, and I can then live on my own (if the case may be) whilst studying in Denmark.

The way I see it is that I get to be with my girlfriend, and also get free tuition.
We met online, we've known each other for about 2 years, and we only got together 9 months ago because we were terrible at telling each other how we felt. She's both my best friend and my girlfriend, and we never seem to tire of being around each other (before I came to Japan I lived with her for 7 weeks with no issues).

If I'm being naive, or if there's anything the community here would like to tell me to be prepared for, or anything like that, I'd greatly appreciate it. I haven't been in a relationship this long before so I don't think I understand life and relationships perfectly, I am taking things from my own experience.

Oh, and my contingency plan is to apply for a course in the UK this January, and if we don't work in Denmark, I can come to the UK and study that... but it is both expensive and I'd like to be with my girlfriend.

I am a 21 year old male currently in college who has been without a relationship for exactly a year as of this week. My last breakup was with a [29] year old woman at my workplace who had extreme bipolar issues... I was head-over-heels for her though, and loved every text message and phone call we exchanged while we were away from each other. Since that breakup, I have had many HORRIBLE dates with other girls at my workplace who just seem way out of touch with what I want in a woman. I no longer enjoy any sort of communication outside of friendship mannerisms whatsoever.

Just this week, some random new girl [18] at my workplace decides to call me and flirt with me a bunch even though I hardly even know her at all. She seems very desperate despite how overly nice she is, it almost disgusts me. I am reaching the realization that I have no desire to date such ""clingy"" and overly desperate woman even though I've craved a loving relationship for so long.

Since my last breakup, my best friend has even been trying to hook me up with women as either dates or fuckbuddies, and I have resisted every attempt. IDK what it is but I have this fear of losing my concentration on my hobbies, my college career, my personal freedom, etc. I am utterly annoyed by these new girls desperate for boyfriends who constantly text me and say nice things to me, cause I feel like I was once desperate for love too. But I have no desire to date or flirt with these girls who don't interest me both visually and personally.

My friends/family think I'm being a bit ridiculous by hesitating to give anymore girls who flirt with me a ""chance"" or a few dates to like them. I get the feeling though that all these girls want is someone to mooch on and get laid by, and that isn't my style.

My question for all of you is: Is it OK to not be interested in dating/sexual relationships till after college or until I grow up a little? How do I decline opportunities to date nice women who just don't interest me from the getgo? I desire a pretty woman who has career ambitions rather than these coworkers that pursue me because they are lazy and have no career ambitions outside of having kids and working a low wage job.

**TL;DR: I only dated once and since then, I am annoyed by the constant texts/flirtation/phone calls from girls who don't interest me.  Sometimes I think I only desire older women or girls with career aspirations themselves... Is it ok to be resistant at my age? How do I nicely tell girls no that just don't interest me? Do I at least owe them a date? I feel like a girl I barely know who is head-over-heels for me should excite me, but instead it greatly stresses me out and I instead find ways to tell them ""Thanks, but I'm not interested"".**  

Any tips would mean a lot to me.

1353001367.0,10,self.relationship_tips,138zce,Wanting to create new relationship habits to strengthen our bond. [M26 and F22],12,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/138zce/wanting_to_create_new_relationship_habits_to/,"Hey there,

Recently, I have been skimping on the ""showing"" part of love and i am wondering how best to create some good habits that keep our connection strong, sexual and otherwise.

My girlfriend absolutely loves the feeling of ""new"" and excitement that comes from the unexpected in a new dating situation. I want to keep giving that to her despite my moves being a little tired and old. Let me be a bit more specific in saying that, its not the sex act so much I am talking about as much as the feeling of a ""date"". Those first touches, kisses, hugs, and caresses. The not knowing aspect.

My initial thought was perhaps a good bridge to that was to work on my flirting skills; admittedly I have none to very little. But perhaps there are some other ways. I have never been much of a Dominant per say but I can play the part, I find that I am horrible at ""acting"" which maybe is part of the problem to begin with. Roleplaying seems to be a bit much for me, but sometimes I think its the only way to get that ""new"" feeling.

The other side to that, is she is often VERY busy. I am often unsure whether a certain day is a ""good"" day to take the lead and be more forward, (which i am sure she would like in the right mood), or to let her have her space. I am terrible at reading that. Of late I need to make sure within all this that I respect her boundaries during the times that she really needs to just be alone. I know your first instinct is to say ""ask"" her and communicate, but I want to make it seem not forced you know? I don't want it to be like... ""oh hey, can i flirt with you today? How's that feeling?""

A few questions then:

1. How can I better Flirt with her and turn it into a good habit? (resources?)
2. What kinds of little things can I do to show her my appreciation outside of ""turning her on"" flirting?
3. How can I make sure I keep the effort up? 

I am hoping this drives a really good discussion as I am open to many ideas.

But what?,17,10,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/12c2js/i_f21_have_never_been_kissed_and_now_i_am_going/,"Ok. So I am 21, female, and I have never been kissed before. I have dated a little, but nothing ever progressed to anything physical. I am not really delusioned into thinking that my first kiss will be this awesome, super romantic, event (especially because I am an actor and most likely I will eventually get cast in a part where I have to kiss someone) But I am getting to the point where I just want to get it over with. Like, I just hate that it is something so small and silly that I haven't done. 

I want to make it really clear that this isn't me being like,  ""oh my first kiss needs to be super special *swoon*"" nor is it me being all forever-alone-y. I have just come to the place where I realize that I can do something about this, so I want to. Now I just need to know how.

A few people have suggested to me that I just ask someone to kiss me. Explain the situation, and see what happens kind of thing. Other have suggested I get drunk at a bar and just kiss some random dude. I am pretty much decided on the fact that I want to know the name of the guy, so the latter option has been shelved (for now, until I get even more desperate... )

So I have kind of decided that I am just going to ask somebody to kiss me. But that sounds a little forward, I think. The guys that I know who know me well and would probably be comfortable with it, are all in relationships, so I don't really want to make them kiss someone other than their girlfriends. So... who do I ask? There are a few guys I think are cute, but I don't know any of them very well at all (I am in classes with one and in a club with the other, but I only talk to either of them within the context of those events)So I A) don;t know when or how I would be in an appropriate position to ask them and B) don't know how they would react. 

And theeeen there is this other guy, the guy I would really like it to be with, who I have liked for such a long time, and we have a really weird, twisted history. Basically I confessed my feelings to him after MONTHS of us flirting back and forth... To which he replied that he really only liked how much I like him, but he didn't really feel the same way. And he finished it all off by saying that maybe eventually we could be together... to which I replied Hell NO! So I have taken the past 8 months to ""get over"" him... and have failed miserably. But now we are barely even friends any more, we hardly talk, and I think bringing up romantic shit would get confusing. Not to mention, probably fail miserably. 

So... help?

Forgive me, but this is cathartic and I'm not entirely sure how to take it all in.

I've been dating this girl for a couple months, she's 25, I'm 31. It was going ok, we were having a good time together, but she wanted it more than I did and I probably just pushed her away. Well last weekend, after a week of not seeing each other, we had dinner to talk things out and we had an amazing time. We had a serious and at times emotional conversation during which, she confessed to getting drunk and making out with some guy. I was pissed, but our relationship was never that serious, but we were exclusive so I was determined to let it go. Anyway, that night she stays with me and we've both expressed our determination to give it a real shot. Yay! Then I can't get a hold of her all weekend. I was out of town, but she's not responding to texts, calls, anything... I""m worried for her well being, thought maybe she lost her phone anything.

The entire weekend goes by and she finally responds to me on Monday morning and tells me that not only has she been ignoring me, but that she's in a relationship with someone else.

I was feeling crushed, angry, hurt, betrayed, but intellectually I knew it was probably for the best anyway. Never makes it hurt any less.

So I spent the evening going for a run and then, basically sulking and smoking pot to take my mind off of it. Then I got a message from my college best friend on facebook. He was just making chit chat, but I could tell he was being awkward and that something was on his mind. Then he told me that he and his boyfriend of several years (who I also know very well) have tested positive for HIV.

I think I handled it pretty well. I told him that I loved him and would always be there for him, but also that it was important for me that he takes care of this in a responsible and healthy manner. He just found out, but has already been referred to a support group that he's planning to attend and so I feel like he's dealing with it well so far.

I guess the reason I wrote this is that I see lots of posts on here of people complaining about their heartache. I'm certainly not immune. Yesterday though, taught me a valuable lesson in perspective and that while some problems might hurt temporarily, it's just not that big of a deal. It really isn't!! Other problems last a lifetime and can ruin lives. So let the bullshit go and focus on what really matters.

tl;dr - While bumming about a failed relationship, I learned that my best friend is HIV positive and what's really important in life. Oh, and wear condoms people!

I've never had a real girlfriend, and I'm 21. In my opinion (based on everything I've seen in my first year), since I'm in college, the people I'm meeting are most likely to just be looking to have fun, and not actual relationships. Those who do want relationships are looking for long term.

I'm not sure what to do - a really awesome (somewhat emotional, but I'll take anything I can get :( ) woman (21 as well) finally cut off her ex the other day.

Previously, it sounded like they were going to get back together. I haven't slept with her, and while I would like to eventually, I'm a little shy and I'd like to take my time with such things.

[40-ish]",10,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/zykdb/married_with_children_and_everythings_great_but/,"Just looking for a sounding board here, more to actually talk this out for my own sanity than anything else. I realize that I'm a bit older than your average redditor here, but it just goes to show this stuff never gets any easier. If anything, it gets more complicated. 

The details:

- I've been married for 17 years.
- We have 2 kids (middle school/high school) 
- 7 years ago wife cheated. I held things together, and everything is great now.
- As near as I can tell, wife is actually happy with the relationship at this point. Which is great.
- I'm not. I still largely feel hollow inside from the emotional devastation 7 years prior, have trust / connection issues with her. She has no idea, as I don't want to open old wounds or upset her happiness. Yes. We've been to marriage counseling.
- Her position whenever the idea of us splitting up has come up is that we're in this because we want to be, and if you (me) wants out, leave. But I know this would devastate her. And I don't want that. 

-=This is where it gets complicated=-

- I'm totally infatuated with someone else.
- They don't know, and I'm not going to tell them. 
- I think they're attracted to me as well, but I honestly can't tell and I'm not going to ask. 
- We get along /really well/. 
- ^ That doesn't help my infatuation. ಠ_ಠ
- She's also in a relationship that from the sounds of it is really good. 
- I don't want to fuck that up for her. 
- I'm thinking about her almost all the time, even though I'm trying not to, and doing my best to stay focused on my marriage and family. 

-=The bottom line=-

- I'm not a dick. And I'm trying to do the right thing. Which seems to be just suck it up and deal with it. I'm just ... lonely for a connection/bond that I can't seem to rekindle with my wife, and I it saddens me that she doesn't seem to notice. I don't want to hurt her, because I /do/ love her -- but I've found that I really don't really /like/ her any more. 

So, I'm stuck in a relationship with someone I love (think more sibling than lover type love) that I don't want to hurt. AND, I don't want to put my kids through a divorce. Meanwhile, I'm playing Charlie Brown to the Little Red Headed Girl (no, she's not a red head).

He initially jokingly(??) told me his parents would never approve, not because of class/money issues but because they are ""very conservative and catholic"". Now that I am actually going to meet his father he tells me he no longer thinks that now because he has got to know me better.

I have now and have had several friendships with guys (I'm a hetero female) that have wanted more with me. I've always been very honest with said male friends, i.e. telling them I do not now, and more than likely will not ever, have feelings for them beyond friendship. Because of this, I think, we are often able to maintain a friendship.
Well, for the first time, I am on the other side. I have not genuinely liked ANYONE as more than a friend in over four years--since my first and only serious relationship.
The thing is, I'm very grateful for having finally met someone I really like- I thought I was broken (or just had WAY too high of expectations) for a long time. The dilemma is, should I be his friend? I have a strong distaste for rejection (surprise) and I really don't want to get hurt. At the same time, he is AMAZING and theoretically I want him in my life no matter what. I need advice, please.

I'm also sorry for the heavy parenthetical abuse.

I was able to talk to a girl without feeling awkward at all  recently and I was so excited because that hadn't happened in so long, and I just found out she is a lesbian (not that I care about that at all, I'm very pro-gay) and it makes me think I am missing something that other girls have. I am actually very feminine and girly though in my opinion so I don't see what the problem is. A lot of times though I will accidentally say the wrong thing or a I will tell a funny story where it... maybe doesn't fit? and an awkward silence will follow. I feel I have learned to talk to guys too much and I talk to girls how I do to guys and it comes out wrong or something. But the thing is that I am never rude or anything, and I never act cocky.

I felt (and still feel) that her family pressured her to end the relationship and seek someone better than myself without considering her feelings. She recently acknowledged that sentiment and has started revisiting our relationship regardless of her families opinions.

For about two months she wouldn't talk to me, text me, or contact me in any way. I did everything I could within my power to acknowledge my mistakes, and make reparations. These amends included; sitting down with her father, aunt, sister and friends face to face and telling him them whole story of what happened, why, and how sorry I was. I also made significant improvements (therapy, keeping a job long term, getting back into school, maintaining financial stability) to better my own life and by extension the life of my significant other. 

My ex eventually came around and we started talking again. To my absolute delight and amazement we had drinks and watched a movie at my place yesterday. I am thrilled to have the privilege of rebuilding our friendship and hopefully a relationship. 

There is definitely a some sexual tension between us. She and I had a fantastic sex life, and to be blunt I miss it. I have no interest in seeing other people or in any casual flings. The last thing I want to do is pressure her into any physical activities, but it is extremely important to me on an emotional level.

A few years ago I met someone online totally by random chance and we immediately hit it off. We started emailing, often sending 3 to 6 different emails at a time, discussing all kinds of subjects from trivial matters like our favorite music and movies to our deepest fears, ambitions, secrets, etc, talking for hours at a time, often late into the night, even to the point of occasionally forming our RL plans around our cyber chats. We have always felt like we can tell the other absolutely anything, we are a huge part of each other's life, even though this friendship is strictly online. I have never experienced a friendship like this, and to get straight to the point, he is everything I have ever looked for in a human being. I don't want to waste so much space gushing over him, but he is mature, funny, caring, witty, ambitious, independent, artsy, has unique interests... and so on and so forth. At first he was just someone I looked to as a best friend, someone I could always confide in, someone I never wanted to lose in my life. But fast-forward to now, we are closer than we have ever been and I feel like my feelings for him are becoming more than friendly. We videochat basically every other day, watch movies together (online), continue to stay up late together, and the face-to-face connection just makes the friendship even more intimate. I don't know if I'm ready yet to say that I am in love with him, but this is much more than a simple crush. He is a beautiful human being, and I am falling very hard.

A few complications: I am 18 and he is 28. We don't live in the same country. We have totally separate lives, and I have absolutely no reason to think that we have any chance of being together whatsoever. I know he is wanting to get in a serious relationship with someone soon and eventually have a family, but he has had very bad luck with women and it doesn't seem like he's actively searching for a girlfriend as of late. Anyway, I think sometimes the conversation has become borderline flirty (then again, this might just be me WANTING it to be flirty), he calls me beautiful and an amazing person quite often, and I feel very sure that he feels the strong connection we have, but for all I know, this is just him being incredibly sweet, and he just sees the connection as a strong friendship and not a romantic one at all. So I am not going to jump to conclusions about how he might or might not feel about me.

So I'm not looking for tips to reel him in or anything like that. I have absolutely no clue how to control my own feelings, or what I should do about them, and that's what I'm looking for advice on. We always talk about meeting up, and I think there is a good chance it will happen within the next year, if a good opportunity presents itself. I have been toying with the idea of telling him how I feel when we do meet up, but this idea also terrifies me. Even if he somehow, by some stroke of magic, feels the same way, our lives are so separate that it would be near impossible to simply be together. If he does not feel the same way, I am not only going to feel absolutely crushed, I will almost assuredly ruin an amazing friendship by making it uncomfortable as fuck for him, which is the LAST thing I want to do. I want to preserve this awesome thing we have for as long as possible. But the curiosity, the possibility that he might feel the same way, is burning such a huge hole in my brain that I fear I might just blurt out my feelings at some point so I can just see what happens.

I also worry that if I never tell him how I feel and just keep it bottled up, I won't be able to move on to other guys. Even if I start meeting great guys in college, my mind will always be on this online friend, and I don't want to commit to someone else while I'm thinking about another guy in this way.

So yeah. This is my predicament, and I know I have a lot of time to think about it, but I really got the urge to get some feedback on it now, and maybe get some advice that I had not previously thought of. Any perspective, male or female, young or old, is appreciated!!

**TL;DR: I'm a girl falling very hard for online best friend. We have very separate lives, and I have no idea if he feels the same way. We might meet up within a year. Should I eventually tell him how I feel, or is that a horrible idea and I should just forget about it entirely and see if it goes away or is replaced by feelings for someone else?**",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_v7s74,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/v7s74/possibly_in_love_with_online_friend_what_do_i_do/,

(x-post from r/relationships),11,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/ur5md/how_would_you_feel_if_your_so_developed_strong/,"I am just asking based on curiosity. This is something my friends and I discussed at length yesterday, and it got me thinking that I might be more sex-negative (or feelings-negative?) than I had thought myself to be.

Basically, if you discovered that your SO had strong feelings for someone else, how would you feel? Would it make a difference who the person is? (coworker, ex, mutual friend, acquaintance)?

Strong feelings meaning more than a crush. Possibly love.

Possible answers:

-I would feel angry because my SO should have feelings for only me

-I would feel indifferent because my SO can't control his or her emotions

-I would feel worthless because there must be something wrong with me

-I would feel happy because we are poly-amorous and I'd be happy for him/her

etc.

Would this be a deal-breaker in your relationship? (Would you break up with your SO because of this?)

Would it make a difference if your SO was close with this person and remained close with him/her after developing these feelings?

Personally, if this happened to me, my logical side would conflict with my emotional side. Logically, I would understand that humans are not always in control of their emotions and it is normal to be able to have feelings for more than one person. I would logically understand and not think it's a huge deal. But emotionally, I would go ape-shit and feel worthless. It would be a deal-breaker if my SO remained close to the person after telling me.

My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) have been together for a little over 8 months. He is graduating college next month, and his mother is paying for him and me to come visit her for two weeks in Hawaii where she lives! I've never done anything like this before, so I'm kind of nervous. I haven't met her yet officially, but he and I skyped with her once. She's suuuuper grounded, very Earth-Mother/hippie and open. She likes me already!

I was just concerned about a few things regarding etiquette. I think I should get her a nice gift for letting us stay with her and buying our plane tickets, but my boyfriend insists that she'll consider her gift our company. We were raised in very different home environments - in my family, gifts and special occasions are very important and there's some kind of ""balance"" to be fulfilled (like if your friend drives you somewhere then you pick up the tab for dinner, or if someone invites you to their house you bring flowers or some food - you never come empty-handed). In his family, they don't really care about those things. I feel like if I bring a gift from home, it might come off as sucking up and she'll feel like she has to pay it back through the trip. So I thought maybe giving it to her at the end of the trip might be better. I floated the idea of cooking dinner for her together with Boyfriend, and he seemed to dig it. What do you think?

Am I expected to bring my own towel, or pay for groceries while I am there? Also, I know she will want to catch up with my boyfriend privately since they haven't seen each other for a year - how do I give them space if I don't know anyone else on the island? Is it safe to wander by myself? How do I avoid cabin fever? How much clothing should I bring (is it appropriate to ask if I can use her washer/dryer)?

Her hair goes kinda crazy wavy and curly when left alone or after sleeping on it and team that up with old baggy track pants and glasses there's a drastic difference between the going out and hanging at home version.

Of course, I admit Im not always looking my best 100% of the time so I don't have unrealistic expectations that she should constantly be wearing make up/contacts/etc. But as a guy, there's not as much of a gap between the styled look and the lazy at home look.

It's to the point where he'll ask if I'm having any issues I want to talk about and it's a reflexive 'no' because... well, in my head, I don't need to talk about my problems! I can solve them on my own and besides, they're not really something to burden him with anyways.

I really love this girl, but damn am I afraid that we arent going to be people that can co habit.  We have a good relationship and have talked about my worries already.  


I know for myself that  Im willing to put up with whatever to an extent, obviously I wont know the extent until we live together, but I am more unsure of how much she will be willing to put up with from me.  Living with someone is hard, being married to someone is tough. Im just looking for some advice on how to proceed, or any tips so that we can make co habitation possible.  


We spend every breaking minute of everyday together. You could even say we are living together currently, since she only really sleeps at her parents and spends the rest of her free time with me.  We are getting married soon so I mean im getting nervous because of that, but the co habitation thing is scaring the hell out of me. 


I have lived with someone before, she hasnt.  We are both extremely logical and rational so im pretty sure we can work out any issues. We love each other alot and are willing to do so much for the other.  Im just wondering if theres any advice any one here can give me to ease my mind or come up with something...idk.

My friend is 21 years old and she's been my best friend for years. She's absolutely amazing; No one has ever said anything negative about her. She's hilarious, very sociable, loves going to parties etc. 
It was her birthday a few days ago and it was quite clear that everyone loves her and thinks she's great. She got lots of presents, a surprise party, etc.

However, when it comes to relationships it seems like she has more trouble than anyone else. 
She has kissed guys at parties, but other than that she never had any experience with the opposite sex and she's been getting really depressed over it. It just kills me because I don't know what to tell her anymore.

She really likes one of her friends from college and they get on REALLY well, he invites her to do stuff every week, calls her, etc. but it's quite obvious that he can only think of her as a friend. It upsets her because she knows she's amazing, but that guy only goes for stereotypical cute, blonde girls and she looks nothing like that.  

She has been trying really hard to get over him. There was a party and she tried flirting with a guy she met recently. She told me he rejected her but was very sweet and told her that the reason why he didn't want her was that ""she's too great"" and that they had  become close friends in a short period of time and he didn't want to ruin that. 

She's a very unique person, personality and looks-wise. She opinionated, strong, passionate but can also be the sweetest person ever. Her friends mean the world for her and she always makes sure they know it.
I don't think it's okay for me to post pictures of her, but she is very cute in my opinion; She's short, her skin is dark, she has a lovely smile. Her hair is short, black and spiky. She wears lots of earrings/piercings in her ears and her appearance is a bit tomboyish (but she can also rock a dress) which might be some of the reasons why the boys she's into don't want to be with her...

Anyway, does anyone know what might be wrong? What advice can I give her?

I'm not talking about petty issues.
Let's say you disagree on something like contraception, circumcision, abortion, where you want to live and raise kids, or you object to a value that they hold like a certain religious belief or strong nationalism for a certain country, but the love is there. Is it not meant to be if you cannot agree on something that will affect your lives and the lives of your children in the future? Is it better to figure out what your core issues are and get them out of the way in the beginning before getting serious?

You can love other people, but would you ever compromise your own convictions for love?

I only ask this because I was in a relationship where my SO was pro-circumcision and believed Israel belonged to the Jews, whereas I am anti-circumcision and think that nationalism tied to a genetic identity is dangerous. I don't think those beliefs are reconcilable, and we broke up because of it. I think this was for the best.

Please read, comment, and discuss",15,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/rnnye/to_all_of_the_friendzoners_and_foreveraloners/,"*Before I get started, I have looked through a couple of these subreddits and others to find a place for this and this is not entirely a rant. The rules say no  rants, but this is definitely close to one.*

I am a heterosexual guy, 25 years old.



Hey guys and gals, if you are reading this...take it to heart, or don't, as you see fit. I am sick and tired of the concept of friendzone and forever alone. I know what it is like to be in the friendzone and be forever alone. There are guys out there(and possibly girls idk) who are madly in love with their ""best friend"". We think about you every day. Multiple times a day. We think about what we can say and how to say it so that you like us better. Every night we play through how to get you to like us. For years on end we are like this. We want you to need us. We need you to want us. We might know it is possible to live without you, but our heart cant accept that. We don't know what we would do if you were to tell us you don't want to ruin our friendship. Ruin our friendship? Really? We spend every waking moment thinking of you and we spend every night dreaming of you. We are grateful for every minute that we get to spend with you. But this isn't friendship. No it isn't. We wallow in our self pity and despair over our indecision to bring up this subject. The world won't break if our friendship does, but our hearts will. You value our friendship too much to risk a relationship? Are you fucking crazy? We'll make you happy **forever**. 


This is how I feel when I think about all of you guys(and probably girls) who are out there in the friendzone. I feel you. The people we're in love with, we could never think of negatively, at least not right now. 
I get angry thinking about all the guys out there who are absolutely miserable in the friendzone, but its better than nothing. I'm writing this as I've been in the friendzone for 8 years. I actually joined the marines to get away from the girl I am/was in love with so that I could seperate myself from her and get her out of my head. Alas I now only think of her 5 times a week as opposed to 100 times. We all have our issues and such, and I definitely have mine. I don't want to discuss our personal problems, but I would like it if we could discuss everyone's feelings on this concept of forever alone and friend zones.

About to get fired from my job and have to find a new one, have no friends, spend all my free time alone at home, have no interest in hobbies, my first girlfriend dumped me after i decided she wasn't the one for me and started disregarding her and making her feel bad indirectly rather than doing the right thing and breaking up with her so feel like a dick for doing that. And i also miss her shit tons i would love to be with her now i often question why the fuck i didn't want her and why i wanted to and did end the relationship. I know that there are most likely girls out there who have what she didn't have, ones that are a little sharper a little less oblivious. Ones who have the same paradigm in mind for a relationship, one that doesn't involve turning off the relationship at work (we work together) and making me feel like just another dude. Giving other dudes almost more attention, she just really wanted to follow the company's rules, i think she saw it as being a grown up thing to do. I see it as not thinking for yourself. Shes 18 (I'm 20) and its a joe job. The boss could care less. Outside of work we were fine, it was the happiest time I've had in my life. So now we've been at a point where we make each other laugh at work, and I have more fun talking to her than anyone else there (the other co-workers are mostly our age) it's really the same as if we were still dating whilst at work, the only thing that's changed is since we're not trying to placate one another anymore we don't tip-toe around each other, which is an improvement. I am glad to see her arrive and bummed to see her go. She was really into me during the relationship, and i was too, most of the time. She probably still has feelings for me, and i really like being around her. I want to hang out with her outside of work but don't want to hurt her by making her think i'm trying to rekindle the relationship. Thing is I would love to be in a relationship with her again but know that a couple weeks into the relationship I'd get tired of her again. I just want to hug her right now. think i'm just lonely as fuck. So assuming I am getting fired (most likely) my options are 

1. -cause not sure if i'm squandering the happiest time of my life -Get back together with her, although she could full well have lost all interest in me. And if she hasn't then I would lose interest after a while like last time.
2. -the one i want to do - Try to hang out with her, just as friends, which may be a dick thing to do if she is still into me.
3. Cherish the good times we had and respect her by not spending any more time with her and playing with her emotions.
or maybe there are more options

The option I've been pursuing until now is the don't think about it, you wanted to break up with her, find some one else option. It's been a few weeks since the break up. We were only together for two and a half months. I think of her pretty frequently especially when i'm down. I'm pretty conflicted. After the time it took to write this, and i guess the organization of my thoughts, I don't feel like I could cry like i did before, still sad, just apathetic, towards everything.This may have been better off in the offmychest subreddit, its just that the way i'm feeling revolves mostly around this relationship.

1. The relationship is a partnership, and we treat it as such.
2. We have similar goals and a similar level of ambition.
3. We support one another in our self-improvement goals.
4. We have similar ideas about how to raise kids, and our shallow differences in parenting give us a good balance in how my daughter is disciplined and rewarded.
5. We're open to suggestions from one another and trust one another's judgment.
6. That trust is not blind, it has been earned over time.
7. We like the same kind of sex, and we like the same amount of it.
8. We look at life, the universe, and everything from a similar point of view.
9. We like how much physical contact we get from each other (like hugs, massages, kisses, et cetera).
10. We have some similar interests that we share, and some differing interests that we pursue by ourselves.
11. We have respect for one another, and look up to each other in different ways, but neither of us feels in any way like we're not good enough for the other.
12. We love just staring at each other stupidly sometimes.
13. We're comfortable around each other.
14. My life isn't totally empty when he goes away, but it certainly feels like it's missing something.
15. We're one another's break from a hard day at work.
16. We want what's best for each other, and if one of us needs prodding to do the right thing, we're not afraid to give it and we're not resentful when we get it.
17. We are equals in many important ways, and treat each other as such.
18. We are different in several interesting ways, and learn from each other as a result.
19. I am so content with him that I don't even look at other guys anymore, and I'll be honest, I was a big cheater once.
20. We're excited by each other and optimistic about the future because of each other, but it's not the exhilaration or thrill of a shiny new person - it's comfort, contentment, warmth, and satisfaction.

It's more than just my boyfriend being awesome. I'll admit, I haven't been the perfect girlfriend in the past, and I've had awesome boyfriends that were great people, but not great for ME. My current SO has his flaws, sure, but he's perfect for me personally and that's what matters.

What each of us would put on a ""Why my SO is Amazing"" list is going to be different - just make sure whoever you're with treats you as an equal, and make sure there is mutual trust, respect, and love.

I realize this isn't quite the most sensitive way of saying it, but it's how I honestly feel: I look forward to marrying her, but perhaps in about 2 years when we know each other completely, because this is too soon for me.

She told me this constitues a ""no"" to her, and even though I insisted it's actually a ""yes, but not quite yet"", she won't buy it, and she's naturally devastated.

Daughter is 2 years old.

Currently, the woman involved is currently going through child support proceedings with the father and is attempting to file for full custody of her daughter as the father is, essentially, a deadbeat with no professional ambition, no mode of transportation, and would provide a poor environment to the child if awarded more rights. On top of this, the father has not seen the child nor attempted to since well before Christmas of last year along with providing a relationship filled with emotional abuse and unfaithfulness with the mother.  The mother provides a stable and loving living situation for the daughter as is, and is primary caregiver.

From my end, I am entirely self sufficient financially. I have every intention, should it come to it, that I am willing to fulfill a fatherly role in whatever way that I can for the mother and daughter. I am comfortable with the idea of being with someone that has a child outside of our relationship and the mother and I get along exceptionally well. I know that I am capable of loving this girl as if she were my own.

I've [25M] currently just moved abroad for an internship project, while my girlfriend [23F] of 3 years stays back home to study. I've taken to keeping a daily diary describing my experiences. It's a doc file which I update, save, and send to my GF, father, and mother. Thing is, when I spoke to my GF via Skype and told her I was thinking of maybe adding images to it, she told me that ""you don't have to spend so much time on it"", which bothered me unexpectedly badly. 

It felt to me like she assumes I'm writing the diary for her alone, while I'm actually doing it mainly for myself. Even though I appreciate her concern and she probably meant to say this to make clear she doesn't expect me to keep her updated on every little thing, her saying this very much affects my motivation to keep the diary, and I'm now struggling to write. Earlier, I had no problems writing, and paragraphs flowed from my fingertips.

It's a similar feeling to the one you get when your parents tell you to do something which you were going to do anyway, thereby completely removing your desire to continue doing that thing, and stop.

I guess I'm just looking for some reflection on this. Did she sort of claim my writing as 'for her'? Am I too possessive about this? Is it just better to keep the diary entirely to myself? Or write it for myself, and send it to the relevant people for their reading pleasure?

1364372620.0,7,self.relationship_tips,1b3mqz,Schrodinger's Feelings: An analysis of romantic interests within a friendship.,14,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1b3mqz/schrodingers_feelings_an_analysis_of_romantic/,"**Your mind can help you in unexpected ways sometimes. When a situation arises where any sort of analysis would have negative consequences, it can stop you from doing so, allowing you to continue on with your relationship with no fear of over-thinking things and screwing them up. In this case? Trust your mind.**

*I have found myself recently in a strange situation recently and I decided to dissect it into the actual feelings at play and distill its essence into a single explanation. I am a science student and so have written it in the form of a classic experimental report.For reference, both myself and the woman in question are twenty year old college students. I hope you enjoy it!* 


**Situation:** Having recently met a rather incredible woman, thoughts initially arose as to the possibility of something more coming out of the acquaintance. However, it was quickly made clear that she was  n a committed relationship (almost two years now) and is very much in love.

**Development:** Having known almost immediately that she was unavailable, I instantly refrained from thinking about her in such a way, I just don’t feel comfortable doing it. As time went on we got to know each other a little better and quickly became very good friends. At this point I’ve shared secrets about myself I’m never told anyone else (except family and medical professionals), I’m readily available to help her through any sort of emotional turmoil she might be experiencing and she is also willing to reciprocate. We enjoy each other’s company and are even planning to get an apartment together for college the coming year (third year, in case of future reference).

**The Problem:**
Someone looking at us sees how close we are and may immediately assume that we are a couple (which isn't the case). She is in a happy relationship and I am perfectly aware and accepting of that. I am not in a relationship (nor have I ever been in one), so there is the possibility that I could yet develop strong feelings for this woman, or indeed could realize that I am indifferent and am perfectly satisfied with the friendship as is. It would only be natural given our compatibility and closeness, yet it hasn’t happened… Why?

**Analysis:**
Usually in cases such as this I obsess and analyse the relationship until I either have a satisfactory answer or drive myself a little more insane than I already am. This time however nothing of the sort happened.
My own ideals, that you should not cheat on your significant other and that you should not pursue someone in a committed relationship seem to be preventing my OCD from taking control of this situation and, basically, fucking things up for me.
There is also the point that more than just me could get hurt in this situation. I would end up hurting myself to be sure, but she would also be hurt from the fact that she’ll lose a friend AND that her relationship with her boyfriend could be slightly compromised as a result. Not to mention the fact that her boyfriend is completely innocent and ignorant of the situation and could end up hurt with no idea why and through no fault of his own.
What seem to have occurred are any romantic feelings I may or may not have at the moment for her are being blocked from the analytical section of my mind, because of some of my OCD related neuroses; thus allowing me to continue with the friendship as if I have there is nothing further at work here! This metaphorical “box” in my mind remains closed to the part of my brain that wishes to analyse it further!

**Speculation:** While there is no analysis currently underway in the proverbial box, there is still a major possibility that “emotional reactions” could still be taking place within. Without being able to analyse what’s inside there is no way to know if my feelings are such that reactions can take place, the extent to which reactions are taking place, or if there is there is actually anything occurring there at all!
Analysis of it would inevitably cause the dissolution of the friendship as it is at any rate, with other possible effects (the likes of which I’ll not go into detail at this point, as they would be pure speculation).

**Results:** I have decided to call this phenomenon “Schrodinger’s Feelings” in homage to the Schrodinger’s Cat principle that this is so similar to . To my mind at this point there are certain criteria that have to be fulfilled in order for a situation to be described as such…
	The romantic interest must be in a committed relationship, or a similar such situation where romantic availability is impossible, barring any major turn of events.

	The interested party must have ideals similar to the ones described above where the possibility of “stealing her” is out of the question.

	A relationship of another sort has blossomed out of initial contact (e.g. friendship), meaning that any attempt at a “move” will likely result in either or a third party getting hurt.

Limits have also been imagined as to when the box may be opened, as follows:

	She specifically asks you to and is in an emotionally sound state to be able to make such a decision. E.g. cannot happen immediately post break-up or during a fight.

	A cross-roads is reached in the life of either party where the only (or most preferable) way to continue on is to open it.

	A situation comes about whereupon there is nothing left to lose from opening it. E.g.  The friendship has ended with no possibility or reconciliation; or she makes it perfectly clear that there is absolutely no romantic interest on her part.

**Discussion:** People seeing us label me as being in the “friend-zone”. This may be perfectly true, but only if I’m actually interested romantically in her and at this point, I can genuinely say that I don’t know how I feel about her. Granted, the odds are slightly in favour of my having such feelings for her, but there is still the possibility of romantic indifference on my part.
At this point we both seem content in keeping our relationship as is, with the friendship still growing stronger of course. Schrodinger's Box allows us both to continue doing so without fear of threatening the friendship with over-analysis of possible feelings.

However with recent arguments during wedding planning I started to feel very distant from him and started to think he was acting like his old self.
I'm not trying to justify my actions but I did go through his emails and other items.

While I checked these accounts there was no activities but it really hurt me.

I'm a full time college student and he works full time, we live 3 hours away from one another. It was a messy breakup that we allowed to drag on for several months because we both still missed and cared for each other greatly. He was my first serious relationship, first person I was intimate with, really my first love.  My frustration at him breaking it off with me, telling me that I can see other guys, but still wanting to keep in contact led me to seeing other guys in hopes that maybe I could move on when I realized I shouldn't wait around for him to make up his mind about what he wanted. He would look me up on facebook and see pictures of me with other guys I was talking to and he'd get angry with me and cut off contact with me for a few weeks and then we'd start talking again. This went on for awhile and finally we cut off all contact for a couple of months so that we could breath and take time away from each other to decide what it is that we wanted. We are now just starting to try again but we're taking this slowly and carefully so as to not repeat the same hurtful mistakes we made the first time around.

So, here's the background info: I've recently entered a new school for further education and we were placed in orientation groups to 'be introduced' to the school. I am pretty bad at socializing and making friends (Shameless plug to [My thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/makingfriends/comments/184eae/making_friends_in_a_large_group/) in /r/makingfriends which I also need advice in, but this is a separate issue) but managed to make friends with this girl (Let's call her Girl X from now) because she transferred into the school a few days after orientation begun and the orientation group's leader(our seniors) placed her with me(since they noticed I don't have many friends) and also to help her along since I'm definitely more used to the school than her, and we ended up hitting it off quite well, pretty much hanging out with each other for the next few days. 

But this is where the problem starts, a few days ago, the orientation program ended quite late due to an annual school festival and the whole orientation group decided to go for supper together. It was about 11PM or so before we headed home. Coincidentally, I live quite close to girl X (about a 10 minute stroll away) and very coincidentally again, the only bus heading to our area stops near her house. (5 min walk away from hers)

So naturally, we decided to take the bus back together, but this resulted in quite a problem. I don't know how to describe it, but I hope this [badly-drawn picture can help](http://i.imgur.com/uHxRg0c.png).

This resulted in me 'splitting up with her' at a junction at first, then at the point where our paths cross again, I just barely walked past her entering the lift(It's an apartment block). 

From this point on, it's just my pure imagination and conjecture, but I think she is starting to avoid me somewhat, normally we would at least have small talk and some jokes and walk together, but now she just replies a quick 'Hi' if I were to greet her and walk away to be with the group of girls. So I was thinking that she might have thought I'm stalking her or following her or something psychotically crazy desperate. 

I want to clarify this with her, but I'm quite shy and don't know how to approach the topic without seeming creepy. At this point, I don't even know if clarifying with her is a good idea or not, so I'll like to ask your opinions on this. 

(Forgot to add this in, but I do have an interest in her and am hoping to at least be a friend first)

I started dating this girl who lives in another city recently.  Met at a wedding, started talking on the phone, went to visit, and things have been going really well.  We have the same sense of humor and just seem super compatible, a lot in common, great chemistry.  At the risk of sounding ridiculous, the metaphor of fitting together like two puzzle pieces has been used.

So anyway, that's awesome, except she lives in another city.  I went to visit her for a weekend in November, and then she came to see me a month later for the weekend.  That first month apart seemed pretty reasonable, but after she came to visit, I couldn't stand it.  We weren't supposed to see each other for another month until New Year's, but after a week and a half, I called her on Tuesday and told her to come see me and she bought a plane ticket for that Friday.  And then, the two weeks between when she left and when I went to see her for New Year's took AGES.  We talked on the phone for like 800 minutes the week before I got there, and neither of us even likes being on the phone.  I was there for the whole week of New Year's and despite our fears that we'd get sick of each other, that definitely didn't happen.

So anyway, I came back Sunday, and I've just been practically incapacitated.  Like, I can't get anything done at work because I'm just thinking about her all the time.  I have been trying to go to bed early but when I try to go to sleep at night my brain won't stop and at this point I'm super exhausted from lack of sleep.  I can't focus on my real life because I'm just thinking about when I'll see her again.  I've got it bad.  It's like an addiction.  I'm going to visit in a week but right now I'm just looking at how much a plane ticket tonight will cost me, despite having plans to go hang out with friends tonight and needing to take care of some stuff at home.

And I know I can't complain at all because there are people in LDR across continents and months.  We're fortunate because we can afford to come visit each other every two weeks.  But I can barely handle being apart for days.  It's so ridiculous.

We both have non-relocatable job committments and leases until the summer, and we've decided we can run away together then, but I don't know if I can make it.  I've thought about being ridiculous and quitting my job, which is probably a bad career move.  I've also thought about just breaking it off because I don't think I can tolerate how I feel when we separate again.  I'm just obsessing.

A couple years ago, I (19 F) slapped my then boyfriend (19 M) across the face because I was so disgusted by his repeated lying, cheating, and emotional blackmail (he would cut himself and blame me for it) for over a year, and in the moment, I felt like how much emotional pain he put me through made it okay to slap him once out of fury.

While our relationship was VERY rocky during the last few weeks of it, that was pretty much the end of our three year relationship. It's been three years since we broke up and both of us don't talk regularly but are on good terms.

However, I've noticed that whenever I see people discussing physical abuse, they assert that inflicting any kind of physical pain qualifies as abuse, including situations like mine.

I just didn't want to see him ever again and the anger I felt for having experienced so much pain because of him manifested itself that day when I slapped him.

Though I would never think of slapping a guy I'm dating who I want to stay with, I slapped my ex because I was at the end of my rope, as was the relationship. I had no intention of ever contacting him again and expressed my anger by hitting him. I'm curious if the internet thinks this qualifies as ""physical abuse,"" and why or why not.

I've looked up definitions online, and they seem very vague since according to their standards, my parents smacking me on the butt occasionally when I was REALLY naughty counts as physical abuse, even though I think having my butt smacked a total of 10-20 times during my childhood does not count as abuse.

Sadly my boyfriend thinks I ask for too much, do too little, want to talk about the relationship all the time. If I ask for affection, he tells me 'come and get it' or I get very little voluntary affection. He avoids sex when I insinuate I want some, and instead everytime he wants to, I accept because maybe this would my  only chance.
He shows almost no initiative when planning holidays, helping in the house, buying and making food.  He never says ""what can I do to help?"". If I ask for help, it's forgotten, ignored,  resisted or simply we just fight because I am too demanding or I expect things to be done on ""my time-line"". I get the silent treatment - he will not discuss with me when I get upset or when he has done something to hurt my feelings.
I don't know what to do or how to behave, I am so confused and frustrated.

I don't really mind if he sees this, but I also don't want him to worry unnecessarily. 

We've been dating about a year and a half, live together, no bumps in the road so far. Until recently I was perfectly happy with everything. Then shit started hitting the fan at school/work and I've been a nervous wreck. I can kind of fake being happy most of the day, but sometimes I just break down and cry and I get really scared because I don't think this reaction is proportionate to the reality of the work I actually have to get done. It makes me feel cray-cray. A lot of the time I can't sleep well. It feels like I'm having a low grade panic attack for hours on end.

Anyway, my bf is a really patient guy, but I know one of his pet peeves is people who let their emotions get out of control and don't do anything to help themselves. I think he would do just about anything to help me as long as both of us believed it would actually work. But I can't really think of anything else for him to do other than being nice and giving me hugs. I'm also getting kind of worried about pushing him away. I know it sucks to be around someone who is miserable all the time. I asked him about it and he said it wasn't a problem, but he's already insanely busy and tired all the time from work so I don't want to be an extra burden. 

What do I do to make this better? I got chill pills from the doctor and they sort of helped. I already exercise and make an effort to get out and see friends. Should I go leave the house and distract myself when I feel bad? Is there any way I can express ""Hey, I'm freaking out right now but please don't worry it's only temporary"" without that being an invitation to worry about me? If you're experiencing toxic emotions that are a little out of control, what is the best way to deal with how that might affect someone you love?

Now don't get me wrong, I like dogs. I raised and trained hunting dogs for 15 years before my divorce a few years ago.

The problem is that she is simply not a good dog owner in my opinion. Her dog (Labradoodle) is very dumb, but even dumb dogs can be managed. She doesn't issue specific commands, she yells and hits the dog when it does something she doesn't want it to. So if the dog jumps up on someone, she doesn't say ""DOWN"" she just yells the dog's name and shoves it off. The dog really has no idea what just happened except that its human yelled and pushed it, but without a command, it can't know why. So that behavior will certainly be repeated. 

Also just a lot of other things that, as someone who actually knows how to manage dogs, really bother me. She doesn't have any control over the dog, and that is hard for me to be around.

Now we both have kids, and I get that when you date someone with kids, you better be sure you like them, because they are a package deal. Does this rule apply to animals too? Obviously when I go to her house I will have to be around this situation, but suddenly this is in MY house, and I am not dealing with it very well .

I have tried to give her some advice with regards to how to get a dog to behave, but it simply falls on deaf ears. She just very simply doesn't want to hear it.

I am not really sure how to bring this up with her. I think it would come off as a real dick-move to say ""Hey don't bring your dog over"", because she really can't just leave it at home for long periods of time, but I never even gave her permission to bring it in the first place. She just assumed.

I probably should have brought it up the first time she brought it over, but to be honest, I was kind of hoping it would work out because as I said, I do enjoy dogs.

I don't really have any legitimate reason that a dog can't be in my house or in my yard.

1345083656.0,7,self.relationship_tips,yaqby,A bit about toxic relationships.,14,7,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/yaqby/a_bit_about_toxic_relationships/,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this or not. Since it deals with relationships and the psychology of relationships, I could think of no better place. If there is a better spot to post this, please let me know. 

This post is about the term “toxic relationships”. Thankfully, I don't see this term used very often, but I do see it used. I want to show you, in my opinion, why using this term to describe a relationship does more harm then it does good. 

**What is toxic?**

When I think of the word toxic, I think of things like nuclear waste, rat poison, or an egg salad sandwich that has been sitting out in the sun far too long. I think of things that when they are consumed, inhaled, or touched, they cause harm to the body. This harm that causes us harm is one sided. If you eat rat poison by mistake, there is no way to get revenge on the poison. You either find an antidote, wait till the effects go away, or get sick and possibly die. There are few options in which to treat a toxin and the interaction with one is often unforeseen. Simply put, a toxic item  does direct damage to a person without prejudice or judgment. Most importantly, when I hear the word toxic, I am left to believe that we have little or no control over the damage it does.

**Why is it a bad term to describe relationships?**

I believe that there are many reasons why this is a bad term and one of those is that it is a word with shock value. When we her someone use the term toxic relationship, we instantly think that the whole relationship is completely horrible and one-sided. We are led to the belief that one person is completely responsible for the (un)well being of another. We assume that everything can be wrapped up, defined, and solved by a simple term. 

We all know, since we all have relationships with family, friends or lovers, that nothing can ever be so simple to define. Relationships are complex and constantly evolving and if we use such a simple and broad term to describe why a relationship is failing, we are not being fair to the people involved or the relationship itself. 
For example, lets say Bob and Sally are married. Bob likes to get drunk and beat Sally. This would be a typical  “toxic” relationship. Even if the answers on how to deal with this problem are obvious, we still are not seeing the whole picture. Why does Sally just not leave? What turned Bob into a violent drunk? This situation is obviously bad for Sally, but why tiptoe around what kind of relationship it is. It isn't toxic, its a physically abusive relationship with an alcoholic. 

On the flip-side, lets say Jim and Linda are dating. When they argue, Linda is a person who cries easily and this makes Jim upset and angry. He never does anything physical or says verbal things, but he does get angry at her crying. Some people would say this is toxic for Linda. But wait,  the issue is deeper then that. Perhaps Linda cries easily because she is frustrated and angry with Jim, and wants to talk it out but she does not know how. This is what she has learned to do when she gets upset. The same is true for Jim. Maybe he isn't getting angry at Linda but perhaps he is angry at himself because he does not know how to approach this situation. He just has not learned the best way to deal with either his or Linda's emotions. 

I know the situations are quite sexist, but its what many are like. If we think and view them in a different light, who is toxic to who? Is it Linda because she can't express what she wants to say. Is it Jim because he does not deal with emotions well? Is it both of them? Its reasons like this that the word toxic becomes such a bullshit word. Things are just not as simple as our minds want to make them. 

**So what do we do?**

The bad thing is, on Reddit, we are all guilty of making snap judgments. Its how Reddit works, but I think when someone comes in and asks for advice, they are not looking for specifics on how to solve a problem, but a different point of view. We may say specific things based on very tiny pieces of one-sided information, but the intent is to make the person asking for answers to think from different points of view. I guess it is my intent that this rant is directed at how we view relationships in the real world. Some of this may rollover into how we help others on Reddit, and that would be great. 
Most of all, I just want to make you think about when we pigeonhole relationships under the label of toxic, we may be doing more harm then good.  ",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_yaqby,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/yaqby/a_bit_about_toxic_relationships/,

The type of person she is has always make think that I wish I had a relationship with someone like her, until I recently had the chance (seems like she liked me for the last year)

Since the first or second day she was clear with something, in less than a year she'll be going to a vacation where there's a small chance she won't come back soon, but it most likely won't be more than 6-10 weeks. So she wanted to have a 'loose'/'relaxing' relationship, and I'm ok with that.  She doesn't want anyone to interfere with her plans, since it seems her expectations of this little trip are high regarding being a 'life changing' thing or at least a 'small escape' out of reality.

By the second week we were seeing each other 4-6 days a week, spending entire days in bed, or in another place talking stuff without a  sense of time of an outer reality. 
Days later we talked about how we aren't trying to date anyone else, how this and that, so by the end it seems like we're in kind of a serious relationship, but without of the 'bf/gf' titles.

At this point, the only reason according to her, we're not in a 'formal' relationship is that she doesn't want to fall into the jealousy and similar stuff of it. In practice I wouldn't notice the difference at all except from that point, since she's really into this , even probably more than me.

A couple of days ago, she told that she is letting herself go at this moment but that she doesn't want and won't do it later. Said her feelings won't stop her, even tough I'm not even trying to do anything to hold her back, I'm a person that lives day to day, trying to enjoy my time.

So, talking about this matter, I realize I feel sad about something that makes me feel SO good as I haven't felt in my whole freaking life with someone, will end so soon and so cold.

At the end I am wondering, is it hurtful to keep going in this 'perfect' relationship until it comes to and end (and even have a small hope of things going back to normal after that period) or should I get out of it to avoid being more hurt if I don't land my feet on the earth by the time she has left?

**tldr: I'm in the best relationship I've ever had, but she's warned me that this will end in less than a year due leaving to a couple of weeks trip and wants to leave with no attachments of any kind, which includes me. I'm wondering If staying and enjoy this next months is better than skipping further pain due this reality.**

We broke up last year for about a year, and now we've been together for almost a year. We've had a lot of problems but I love him to death and know he's the one for me. I guess I just wanted some second opinions on something that has always bothered me about him.

He tends to make a lot of friendships with girls. That's fine, and although I think i'm kind of a jealous person to begin with, I feel like his relationships with girls are a little too over the top. He says guys are kind of boring to be friends with because all they want to do is either sit around and play video games, or talk about bitches they want to fuck. He likes to have girlfriends because they're more interesting and like to do stuff, or just sit around and talk. I just feel like he gets way too intimate with girls and their personal lives. I know, that's what friendships are, but almost all of the girls he's been friends with have developed feelings for them. I'll tell him that, but he claims they don't, or that he doesn't see it.

Whenever he makes friends with a girl he is constantly talking to them, talking about them, calling them, spending literally all of his free time with them, texting them, anything else you could think of. I think girls like him so much because he's kind of a sensitive guy. He truly cares about people, and girls loves venting to nice guys who seem to care. The problem is that i'm not really ok with all of it. It comes to the point where girls have called him in the middle of the night because she ""had a nightmare"". And the same girl claimed she was raped by someone and needed my boyfriend to go with her to the doctor to get tested for diseases. All after only knowing him for a couple months.

Also, one of the reasons we broke up last time was because he was planning to go to college with one of his girlfriends and live with her. Granted, I had gone to culinary school an hour north of where he lived. To be completely honest when I was at school, I got drunk and three way kissed my best girlfriend, and some guy. So I understand why he would stop caring about things that bothered me, but I thought that we were trying to move on from that since he had told me he still wanted to be with me, was going to try to forgive me and move forward. I don't use that as an excuse, I know what I did was wrong. But he should have ended it if he was going to stop caring or trying.
Anyways he is an awesome person, and like I said, I know he's my soulmate. I guess I'm just worried that eventually he'll find another great friend that's a girl and it just really gets to me for some reason. And I shouldn't feel scared when he makes new friends. I want to be friends with his friends too but it never really works out that way for whatever reason. I guess I'm just wondering if i'm a crazy jealous girlfriend, or if it's ok to feel unspecial by his behavior?

TL;DR My boyfriend becomes very intimate with the girl friends that he makes and it bothers me.

To be honest i am beginning to think that it may be one of those 'dysfunctional' relationships everybody seems to talk about. I am generally pretty level headed and adapt to people easily (so i'm told..).

So basically she was my first real relationship and she started treating me pretty poorly after about 6 months (once a strong connection has already been made), storming away from arguments (in some cases leaving my car and me having to basically follow her until she gets back in and i was madly in love so i use to chase her etc). I'm no saint either, basically we were immature in a pretty big way. Then she broke up with me over something insignificant (in our whole relationship we never cheated or even spoke to anybody else really (problem number 1 - we cut all other contact besides each other)). In hindsight I shouldn't have been such a push over, i use to cry etc on her doorstep begging for her to come back and she use to tell me to fuck off etc etc.. sigh.

After the honeymoon phase of the relationship (~1 year) and i started to get sick of how she was treating me, i began to just feel less and less. Not caring about the issues she use to bring up, (petty issues like forgetting when she told me she has work next week, etc trust me, whenever i asked other people for advice they were like yeah overreaction). This in turn actually worked out well, she started to clean up her act and treat me a lot better. But, basically i guess i ran out of juice. I became really numb to it all, not really caring and eventually the relationship deteriorated. It was a combination of uni stress, family, friend and work stress which made me tip, I just couldn't handle it so i broke up with her. I never spoke to other girls, i don't feel the need to get with anybody else, i just want her and i want it to work. I am still yet to get with somebody else and it's been 4 months after I broke it off. Not even a week later i tried to get back with her but she was too hurt, i tried again like a week later then a week after that and basically tried to get over her.

So I recovered, I actually recovered fully (around 3 months after the break up) and I still feel like i made the wrong choice by breaking up with her. I know she screwed up first, but i screwed up last and i think she is amazing etc etc and how good it would be if we both treated each other right. So what i did was try super super hard, but i eventually got us to the stage where we're ""taking it slow"". But we are spooning again and kissing etc etc

In my head I want to rebuild it slowly the way it should've been. I am way better now, but I do have a fear that she isn't really ready. Sometimes i ask her on dates and she says yes, then no, then yes etc. So she is confused, I know she doesn't really trust me. I know she is just afraid of getting hurt. When i text her too much she just completely shrugs me off, like she plays hard to get? I saw her today and she started bringing up old problems we use to have and it got weird, but earlier in the day it was all happy while watching tv together etc. I know if I keep texting her she'll just say no, so i'll leave it for a few days and see if she comes back to me. I know, it's games, but yeah I guess we're getting there...

I know it would be easier to just start with somebody else, and I'm young, and it's my first real relationship. I guess i am questioning it and i'm asking for help, maybe your points of view may make it easier

Do you guys have any experiences in this area? Advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** : I am still in love with my ex, was dysfunctional (her fault i guess, she was insecure it affected our trust - she doesn't even really trust her friends, so i think this is where the pettiness came from). I adapted by becoming apathetic, she seemingly got better but damage was done and I consequently ended it. Got over it, went back to normal self and question what it would be like. Opinions and advice please. **What would you do?**

**UPDATE** : Last night she was like, ""oh i don't think this could ever work, i don't trust you now and i don't know how i ever could. I think if you just try and trust somebody else then you might find someone better, I will leave you alone now"". So i replied ""ok"" and that's it."" Then i woke up to a message from her saying ""I'm sorry, i don't know what i'm doing"". So i said ""You said no last night, now you're saying you're confused. Those are two completely different things, are you okay?"". Now she is just complaining to me about her day to day issues but i haven't replied.

Ambiguous title - non-verbal meaning texting and instant messaging not eye contact or posture.  In real life, I'm a fairly sociable person and generally a pretty good conversationalist, but on IM or text, I'm impossibly awkward and artificial.  I would even go so far as to say that I come off as robotic and emotionless.  And what's worse is for a while I thought it was all in my head. But recently, I've gotten a few comments that kind of stuck with me.  Namely, ""you're so much sweeter in person"" and ""I like it so much better when we're actually talking"".  I feel like my ineptitude in texting and instant messaging is really ruining a lot of my relationships - romantically and with friends.  I just don't get it, when I try to be nice, I come off as creepy and when I try to be funny, I sound like an asshole.

I am incredibly shy, but we got along really well and I was intent on making a major move.

A good friend of mine, oblivious of my intentions and affections, made a move. Now I have to see them every day together; cuddling, kissing, etc. It kills me. I have literally never met a girl like this, and to let her get away like that makes me hate myself.

Now the next stage is... how do I deal with this? I have to see this. Every day. Every day, I am reminded that she will never be with me. If I hang out with my other friends, they will be there. I don't want to stop hanging out; they are cool people, I love them all. I just don't know how to deal with this.

I tell myself to accept it. I want to be happy for them. It's so fucking hard. My emotions are torn between wanting to accept it, but also wanting to continuing pursuing it.

I'll start so you can get the gist of what im talking about:
For my girlfriends birthday last August (we technically weren't dating yet at the the time but that's a story for another day) I made her a dozen red roses out of duct tape and drinking straws since i wasn't employed and couldnt afford to buy her real roses. She loved them so much that we officially became a couple 5 days later :&gt;
For our first Christmas i made her a wire-knot rosette ring (video tutorial on YouTube) out of 20 gauge sterling silver wire.. it was a pain in the ass but it came out beautifully.
For our Valentines Day i cooked her breakfast in bed before she woke up (which was a chore cuz im a late/heavy sleeper), had flowers delivered to her front door, took her up to Washington Rock to watch the sunset (its a beautiful vantage point to see the sunset in NJ), then went to a hibachi restaurant for dinner and gave her a full back and foot massage for almost an hour :)
We haven't had any holidays since, but Her birthday is this August and our Anniversary is the following week, i have planned to buy her a new xbox for her birthday (long story short, she bought me a new one in anticipation of getting my old one...it broke that night &gt;.&lt;) and for our Anni im giving her my great-grandmothers earrings from Poland (we're both Polish) and dying her a dozen red roses blue by hand (im a creative SOB lol)

I pretty much know everything about her sexual past. We have been dating for about 3 months now and are getting serious. She has been with 10 men including me, and i know way too many details about them which is partly my fault, as i ask too many questions.

One of the reasons i know so much is that she never really broke off contact with any of these guys. So for the past couple of months I have slowly been dealing with her past through random guys texting/calling flirting with her or posting on her facebook. At first she would tried to hide all these flirty texts with me and be really suspicious about it.

After many arguments she has finally stopped lieing and hiding things from me about past guys, and for the most part she doesnt keep in contact with previous flings. 

The problem im having now is that i was a virgin before i met her and she has been with so many parthners. I just cant deal with the fact that she takes sex as such a small thing, when it really means a lot to me. I cant imagine being that intimate with so many people. She slept with about 9 different guys in a year period. I know this shouldn't bother me as much as it does, and that im being close minded or whatever. But it goes against my values and I just cant stop picturing her having sex and being as intimate as we are with all these other guys. Its pretty much killing me.

I guess its to the point now where I either deal with it or go a seperate way. But the thing is that I am really in love with this girl. We have so much in common and we get along so well.... When im not feeling bad about this issue.

I've read many other posts about similar issues in relationships and the advice has helped a bit. I really want this relationship to workout but cant get this off my mind. Can anyone give me some advice with dealing with this or have similar situations that worked out? Im hoping it will get better in time but its been months now and im still having issues.

1337872895.0,9,self.relationship_tips,u2us5,Some advice for the short guys out there.,10,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/u2us5/some_advice_for_the_short_guys_out_there/,"I just posted this as a response, and feel it's suited for this subreddit as well.

As a fellow short man at 24Y.O., 5'4, 110 Lbs, and a baby face... I feel your pain.

There isn't much you really can do about your height physically, so you'll have to adjust mentally. Unfortunately, we're lacking an attribute that a lot of women find attractive. But that just it. It's one thing. There is plenty more to you than just your height. You can't help what a woman thinks about your height, so why worry about the ones who disregard you simply because you're short? You wouldn't be happy in a relationship with that type of girl.

As with both genders, the initial spark of attraction is purely physical. Height, shape, hair color, skin tone, etc. I'm sure you've met some girls who were drop dead gorgeous but after hearing them speak or seeing how they act/treat others, you want nothing to do with them. And on the other end of the spectrum; I'm sure you've met girls who weren't that attractive but had phenomenal personalities that won you over.

So what you can work on is being an awesome guy. What is an awesome guy? Whatever the hell you want it to be. In my opinion, I try to be fun, funny, respectful, witty, interesting, and I'm almost always smiling.

I usually don't bring up my height ever in conversation, but I will run with jokes in a group of friends about it. It's there, but you don't need to dwell on it. Going with jokes shows that you're comfortable with your height. Getting defensive about it, even if it's the only reason why a girl shot you down is the worst thing you can do about it. More women will think of it as a problem if you make it out to be one.

As for what you can do physically about yourself; there are a few things you can be mindful of. Personal hygiene and image is extremely important. Take care of your hair, brush your teeth religiously, shower often and not being afraid to use soap on every crevice of your body, try to keep an acne free face (I have had some serious issues with it before and I have to wash my face 2-3 times a day to avoid break outs), be clean shaven or have some form of maintenanced facial hair. Be mindful of what scent you use for shampoo, conditioner (if you use that), and deodorant. I never wear cologne, but women tell me I smell great more often than not (All I wear is Old Spice Swagger.)

You can obviously work out to look better, but that goes without saying.

Posture is extremely important (women, this goes for you as well); especially for short guys like us. I see so many people with terrible posture. Good posture can do wonders for your image; it literally can add inches to your perceived height. Straighten out your back, don't drag your feet when you want, keep your eyes up as opposed to looking at the ground, tilt your head back slightly, hold your shoulders back ever so slightly, and don't have your hands in your front pockets (it causes you to hunch over.) To get an idea how what you should be going for, stand up against a wall. Your heels, butt, upper back, and the back of your head should all touch the wall.

Wear nice clothes. Your clothing greatly affects your initial impression on people. /r/malefashionadvice can help, but you don't have to follow their rules to a T. They almost have a uniform it seems. Find what you like, and run with it. Avoid graphic T-shirts and go for plain colors. Also with short sleeved shirt, try not to have super baggy sleeves. It makes your arms look smaller, and just looks off. Dark wash, slim fit jeans are great for just about any non-formal occasion. Don't wear tennis shoes unless you're actually playing a sport. There are plenty of semi-casual shoes that are comfortable, and look good. I've recently discovered Henley shirts and I love them. Long sleeves, but pushing them up your arms almost to your elbows seems to be a thing for a lot of women.

I can't boast and say I take home a girl every weekend, but that's not what I'm going for. I've had three LTRs in the past 6 years; all lasting over a year and a half (my latest ex was 5'7 and very attractive). I'm a hopeless romantic, and getting over being a socially awkward penguin. You just have to make what you have work and run with it.

**TL;DR - Don't dwell on the fact that you're short. Be mindful of your appearance and clothing. Hygiene is extremely important. And for the love of whatever you may or may not worship, stand up straight!**

Now, mind you I am the provider but I don't mind it at all and it hasn't been getting tense because he has been unable to find work.  Anyways, a few months ago, he has been pressing separation (it has been pretty random)  So, need less to say,  I have been fighting it because he seems to lack explanation for why.  I couldn't get him to explain, but he was reacting impulsive and angry.

Past history wise, SO has been through a lot of troubling events... he is a vet (got out last year), unable to get a job, seems to be confused and impulsive (new onset).  I am, pretty much 4 year degree grad, a job that pays well and have had my struggles in life until I graduated and things came together.  Try to keep all emotion out of this text.  I can say, I have gone through the stages of grieving, Feel as though I am somewhere between bargaining and acceptance.  Want it back but, unsure how to go about it..and I genuinely love him and I would say things were going well prior to the past couple of months.  We don't really argue and can easily mutually agree on decisions.

Now my question is...he moved away back to his family a month ago.  We have not really talked since the time it happened (that is probably not very healthy).  I am close with his mom, dad, and sisters and was going to go up to visit in the near future.  However, I don't want to see him but his family thinks I should.  

So fellow redditors, ... Would that be a pretty bad idea to show up unbeknownst to him?  I want to work this out with him but I have a feeling he is not ready to communicate with me.

That has all transpired within the past couple days.  I am NOT going to leave wife on nothing more than a ""whim"", I realize how stupid that would be, 
but I AM wondering if we have a chance.  I am HOPING that ""C"" saying she will not turn 50 was just ""Birthday Blues""

I can't do this any more.

I know that this relationship isn't right for me. I can feel it in my guts, I know it every time she pretends to know something that she doesn't, or tries to pressure me into something I don't want to do. I also know that I've made a lot of mistakes, from getting into the relationship in the first place, over not standing up for myself when boundaries were defined, to keeping my feelings to myself once I started realising that it wasn't going to work out. I should never have let her move in; I should never have let her get a cat; I should never have backed down all the times where she threatened to leave. I should stop telling her I love her, when I know in my heart that that's not really true any more. All I can say in my defence is that I'm weak, and I'm scared, and I'm indecisive. But no more.

I've done some things right at least. I have tried to talk to her about my dissatisfaction, and I have tried to get some concessions from her that would have improved our relationship. Both things have failed, and not through my fault alone. I think the crux is that she has to be in control; she can't ever let go, or let somebody else get something that she didn't choose to get. Sometimes things will get better after I bring them up, that is true. But while we talk about them, she will never agree to change anything, or find some compromise; she'll be like a rock, saying, “No, I will not change for you. I cannot change. This is just how I am.” And maybe she's right. Maybe I shouldn't ask her to change. But I cannot live with the person she is any more; the person she is makes me unhappy, makes me grumpy, makes me want to not come home at the end of the day.

I don't want to make it sound like there are no good times. There are plenty of good times, fun times, cuddling and laughing. I wouldn't have stayed this long – one and a half years if you can imagine, where did the time go – if there weren't good times. Or so I keep telling myself. When things are good, they're great. When things are bad, they're bad, but they're not atrocious and horrible. That's not why I'm breaking up with her; maybe if it were the case, I wouldn't have dithered so long. It's not the intensity of the bad times that makes me want to break up; it's the recurrence, and the knowledge that they will never go away. I don't know if I used to think that they would, but I don't any more. I know now that I'll never be completely happy in this relationship; I know now that this is not what I want.

What do I want? That I don't know; and who could say after their first relationship that they know exactly what they want? Maybe I want somebody who's less headstrong, somebody who can concede a point once in a while and look at things from your perspective. Maybe I want somebody with less baggage, less disastrous relationships, less traumatic family life. Maybe I want somebody who's more supportive of my interests, or gets along better with my friends. Heck, maybe I even want somebody fitter with bigger boobs. It doesn't really matter right now what I want in my next relationship. What matters is that I no longer want this one.

I've been a coward, I've been an idiot. I've not reached out to friends when I should have, when I should have told them exactly what the situation was and asked them for advice. I've not told my parents what was wrong because I didn't want them to judge me, us, the relationship. I've not seen the warning signs; her lack of friends, her inability to stick to anything, her bad work ethic, her inexplicable mood changes. That's not true; I did see them, I just didn't act on them. I didn't break it off when she threw a tantrum the first time I wanted to take an evening to work instead of meeting with her. I didn't break it off when cooking together became a chore rather than something I love doing, because she criticised everything that wasn't done exactly the way she would do it. I didn't break it off when she was rude to my guests, when she got irrationally jealous of my female friends, when she pressured me to stay in with her rather than go out with friends. I didn't break it off when the sex became boring and routine, when she wouldn't reciprocate by going down on me, when I no longer felt attracted to her body. I didn't break it off, and neither did I stand up for myself, and I should have.

Well, no more. I've been away for a few days, I've had time to clear my head, and I know what I need to do. It'll be painful for both of us, but I have to break up with her. We live together, we have the aforementioned cat together; it's clear that it's going to be tricky and time-consuming to disentangle our lives. It's not fair to her, and not fair to me, but neither is staying in a dead-end relationship, one that I know she wants to take further, but that I desperately want to end. Things will be tough for a while, but I know I'll be okay. I hope she will be too. I may not love her any more, but I still have a lot of affection for her, and I wouldn't want her to come out of this any worse than she was going in. I'll break it to her as gently as I can, but I know that I'll also have to be firm, that there's no way I can give even an ounce of ground on the break up issue, because she'll try to change my mind with any means possible.

This is why I'm posting this. You people will help keep me sane, keep me focused and make me go through with it. Even if nobody reads this, I hope the fact that it's out there will be enough to give me the impetus I need. I will post an update to this within a week (by which time we should have had the first talk), followed by updates every week until the relationship is truly over.

They had a talk and what came out of the talk is that she essentially gets one free ""get out of jail card"", the bf just wants to know when it happened, not who or what specifically happened. So she has been cheating off and on for the past 2 years with the same fellow. However she was about to get found and out and used her ""free card"" because she had too or else the bf would have known whom and the details. 

What do you think of this? Acceptable to reciprocally cheat? She did tell him but 2 years after the fact it happened (not when it did happen like he asked) and only because she was forced too. She never would have if not forced too.

I guess you could say I am romantically challenged somewhat... but I have a few ideas, just wondered if anyone could help me realise them to a degree.

I want to incorporate a personal string quartet somehow - to play the song that means the most to us just before I go down on one knee. I know you can hire them, and I have a few musician friends that could help. I got this idea (lame, I know) from an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where Larry has the orchestra playing downstairs and Cheryl wakes up and opens her door to her balcony to hear it. This is not going to happen for us for two reasons: My GF is NOT a morning person, and, I don't have a balcony and a mansion.

Alas, my main problem is the location and the logistics of such a feat. We met at work so setting the proposal where we met is a little unfeasible...!

We spent our first night together in a tent in the Summer in an isolated field alone. So I am thinking of incorporating this. But, getting a string quartet to play and meet in a field is pretty unrealistic, LOL...
Any ideas how I could make this happen? Should I choose a different location for the string quartet after/before the romantic night of camping (I'm talking a really nice tent in a beautiful setting)... I'm also thinking of the realism of a mini orchestra packing up their instruments and leaving as we are getting all cosy and romantically engaged, so to speak... would just be awkward.

Any other ideas would be really great. I've trailed through the Internet and found nothing amazing, just the usual.

I just have this image in my head, and don't really know where to start to accomplish it.

It may be a total pipedream, but it's worth brainstorming it I believe, as it could be really special...

So for the first two months it was basically perfect.  We hung out, we laughed, we went to the beach, etc. etc.  Around the 3 month mark she told me she loved me and I said the same.  I'd never fallen in love so fast.  That was about a month ago, ish.

Last week we took a trip together, for three nights.  It didn't go well.  We bickered about the hotel room cleanliness, about going our seperate ways in stores, about the pictures I took constantly, etc. etc.  I thought about breaking up.  But I love her and figured we could work through it.

Then tonight I came over here to her place and she said she didn't love me anymore and that she didn't see this working.  She had a few minor things about me that bugged her, like that I sometimes left shit in her office, little things.  I had a few major things about her that bugged me, like she's a little self-centered (she agrees), and so on.

And then we cuddled on her bed and bawled our eyes out for a few hours, and then she said she needed to be alone, and here I am venting on reddit.

**What went wrong:**

We both found things about the other that irritated us, but we rarely said them.  She noticed things about my apartment, attributed them to me (my roommate is a slob) and thought we could never live together; she didn't like that when we would go into a store together I would leave her to get the things that I needed; and a few other little things that are a little too private for reddit.  But she didn't tell me any of them until the last few weeks of the relationship.

I was guilty of the same crime.  I didn't tell her that I expected more from her in terms of support, in terms of nice things done, in terms of general lovey-dovey-ness.  Not until it was too late.

That wasn't all.  I loved taking care of her when she was down or stressed, which frequently meant I would help her with her work (at her request, but based on the knowledge I liked to help her).  As a result, she felt like she wasn't accomplishing anything and so ceased to take pride in her work.  That's not a good thing.  And I felt my aid to her was going unreciprocated, which made me feel unappreciated.

**How to avoid this happening to you / what I'd do different:**

If your SO does something that bugs you, tell them gently but firmly. 

If you find that your SO is helping you too much, let them know! 

If things aren't working well, talk about them.  

If you aren't sure you can be in love right now, don't let yourself go.

**tl;dr: It sucks to be venting to reddit in the living room of the girl you love when you've just found out she doesn't love you back.**",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_gidm7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/gidm7/some_advice_for_everybody/,

Any thoughts or advice?",8,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/fwb5u/im_a_male_19_ive_never_been_in_a_relationship_any/,"No: I'm not looking for your condolences or pity. I'm not here for empty rhetoric about how everyone is beautiful, etc. Im looking for concrete reasons as to why I've never been in a relationship before.

First, some info about myself: I've never actively sought out a relationship. You could stop me here and say, ""well, there's your problem, moron"", but I don't see it as a problem. From what I've observed, many relationships simply ""happen"" without too much effort from the girl or guy. I don't put women on a pedastool, thinking that I must humble myself before them. I also don't see them as some object to be claimed and won. Im looking for another PERSON to be intimate with and to share ( or entertain and criticize!) my values.

I'm not one to give myself compliments (again, this could be the problem: no self-confidence), but I've known a few girls to be attracted to me, either after the fact or from another person, so I don't think it's my looks. And I've largely gotten over my fear of girls which, I admit, didn't really dissolve until 10th grade. I exercise, wash regularly, and look clean. Not preppy or ""overly-done"". Just, well, me.

I didn't really want to be in a relationship in high school, as the girls in my school were really shallow and artificial. But now, as a freshman in college, I've taken notice of a few girls who seem pretty, smart and genuine. Combine this with my introversion, and you've got a wanting, lonely result. I've noticed that my desire for a relationship is increasing, and I almost feel WRONG for feeling this way. I've always been attracted to girls, but I've never actually wanted to pursue a relationship with most of them (one super-crush-esque fantasy being an exception.

Also, I've been told that I'm more mature for my age, and certainly this isn't what high school girls are looking for. But surely, in college, this wouldn't matter, right?

Despite this, I have a quirky, yet distinct sense of humor. I'm not serious all the time. True, my sense of humor isn't what one would call common, but it's there.

Phew. Now that I've got THAT off my chest, can anyone shed some light onto how relationships form, and what I could do to maybe facilitate that; I think that LOOKIng for a relationship is counterproductive.

now i know we're outside of the 1/2 + 7 rule(i actually look and act like a late 20's guy, could probably pass for a teenager sometimes), but i'm not trying to wife her up right yet. we are in similar places in life, i'm starting over going back to college for a degree, she's in about the same spot, so we'll graduate around the same time. i'd like to just take her out and see if something is there, we get along great and want someone like each other, and we both find each other attractive(and have thought about dating last year), but now i'm afraid she thinks we're too good of friends and maybe she doesn't see me like that anymore(we really aren't bff's, we don't talk much/etc just get along and talk every other weekend when she's home). and she also has a hangup that all her ex's have had the same type of job, and while i do similar as a hobby, it's not my profession. we line up on a lot of the big relationship stuff, but she comes from a small town, and me from a larger more diverse place so there's some differences in some things, that i'm up for but just have never done before(but i don't want to date my clone)

so my plan is to just text her more often and just try to hang out with her sometime. any tips? any women want to chime in, i'm absolutely clueless about what ya'll are thinking 90% of the time. i mean worst case we don't get physical and just hang out, become better friends, and i compliment the heck out of her and she feels better about herself",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_1i8ip8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1i8ip8/were_flirty_last_year_now_that_were_both_single/,

It seems like the norm is for the guy to be older and I know some of you are wondering about dating older women.  I thought I would share some tips on a relationship with older woman for guys.  I by no means an expert so let me know if my tips make sense or if you have anything you would like to add.  These are my tips with my single experience dating an older women, which was successful.  I also did a bit of research from other posts on Reddit and have come up with these tips.  Ladies people feel free to contribute as well.

* It is possible to become friends first and then start dating (It was harder, but I knew that's how she approached relationships so it worked out).  

* Generally, I found (Through research and observation), women 30+ have a good idea of who they are and what they like/don't like.  If you want to date an older women just be sure you know that you like/don't like too, that helps you find capability much quicker then younger daters.  I was 26 when I started dating a 31 year old female, but I knew what I was looking for in a long term relationship after dating other people before I met this woman.  I just felt younger women (In their 20s) still wanted to ""experience"" things more before even getting into a long term relationship.

* When you first start talking, get a feel of where her maturity level is at.  You may think because they are older than you they have more ""experience"", but that might not be the case.  They could be at the exact same or even lower maturity level as you.  I've always had a high level of maturity for my age and it just worked out for us.  I don't even look at her as older because of this.

* Just because they are older doesn't mean their interests are going to be drastically different than yours.  As in any relationship, celebrate the differences and learn from one another.

* Again through research and observation, not all women 30+ have their biological clock ticking to marry quickly and have kids.  You can tell right away if this is the case.  The important part is to be steady in your relationship of getting to know each other.

1369413791.0,8,self.relationship_tips,1ez9n2,What is love? Here's one answer,20,12,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1ez9n2/what_is_love_heres_one_answer/,"A friend asked me ""what is love"" yesterday and managed to off the top of my head develop a 4 ""stage"" theory love from bits of experience and things I've read. I thought it might interest others, and I'm curious what others have to say. PS - I have no idea how original or unoriginal this is.

Stage 1 - Hormone love: This is gaga teenage love. It's real. It's intense. It's inexplicable. Maybe the person is ""hot,"" or sub-consciously reminds you your mom, or has big tits, or the right clothes, or is just super friggin' cool for an inexplicable reason. It's fleeting though. Any divergence from the abstract pedestal conception of the person (say they do something annoying) can shatter this love. 

Stage 2 - Choice love. There are still elements of hormonal love, but now you've seen the ups and downs of others and are a little more ""realistic."" This is picking someone that has similar interests, values, judgments, intelligence, etc. You both really love each other's company, and there is less ""my beauty is augmented by my association with the beauty of my partner."" It may also lack the ""emotional intensity"" of hormonal love, but is more stable.

Stage 3 - Sacrificial love. This is more like the parent/child love, but it applies to romantic relationships as well. It is no longer about ""getting as much as I can"" from the relationship. It is about loyalty, service, compassion, attention, kindness, etc. The parts of the other that may frustrate, annoy, anger you, no longer impact your love for that person. You're an emotionally wise and sturdy person, who lends supports to others. Their joy is your joy and vice versa. Their suffering is your opportunity to serve.

Stage 4 - Spiritual love. This love is an all-encompassing, true compassion and acceptance. It reflects a connection with source of life (compassion) at the center of any animate being. I don't know much about this kind of love.

That's it. Though these stages are numbered, I don't mean to insinuate a hierarchy or sorts. In my life, I am trying to learn how to love well, and these ideas help me.

I have known this guy since Gr. 11 (5-6 years ago). Back in high school we were more friends of friends. We were in the same computers class and liked similar things. Never really thought much of him back then. Once high school graduated and I joined League of Legends with friends, he was one of the people I played with a lot. It was there that I learned of his great humour, which is a must for a person I like. And a guy that can game is really attractive to me. But, since we lived far away and we never hung out in person, I never thought anything of it. 

Just recently though, when a group of friends went out to eat, he was there and he has changed! He is now really tall (the one physical attribute I really like) and hilarious in person. I was pretty weirded out how attracted I was to him.

But here is the problem: He does not think any girl would be interested in him. He has some form of autism which doesn't really help his social actions. It is like a shell he has built over himself to protect himself from not needing a girl. I have no clue how to approach him on this! I feel any subtly would be classified as joking around ('cause she couldn't obviously be flirting with me'). I don't think saying 'we should go out sometime' will have much affect either.

After being someone's rebound for a month and a half, our relationship ended. I'd like to think that it was actually a good relationship while it lasted, but it was a one-sided. I've never been in a relationship before so I have nothing to compare it to however. We only ever hung out when she wanted to. Still, towards the end of the relationship we opened up to each other in a way neither of us had with anyone else, and I ended up fooling myself into thinking I was in love with this girl. We spent many nights at each others' places and many hours talking to each other on the phone. There was a deep connection there. Her reasons for breaking up with me were because I was graduating college and she was not. At one point she said that further down the line we could try again. She still wanted to keep me around as a friend though, and because I had never been so open about myself to anyone, I naively thought it could work. After a month of me debasing myself in order to spend time with her in naive attempts at winning her back, she got back with her ex.

Looking back on things, I've debased myself so much to this girl. I let myself be manipulated and strung along as a self-esteem boost for her until she got bored of me. I know people say that you should never make your partner the center of your entire life, and while we were dating I feel like I followed that pretty well. I worked as a teacher, went to the gym, took photos, and went out with my friends. But after the break up she kept calling me to hang out, and because I was so lonely I would concede. I couldn't stand the idea that for her I was absolutely nothing, just one of many relationships she had started and ended, where for me this was the biggest event of my entire life up until this point. No one had ever cared, or pretended to care, about me beforehand. Not even my parents. Eventually, I had debased myself to the point where she doesn't even care about me now.  

I find that this cycle of friendship/almost relationship/debased friendship is something that I have fallen into time and time again in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I'm 22 and should have learned by now. In many ways I feel as though I was conditioned this way by my emotionally abusive mother. I have no idea how to stop this cycle from repeating itself.

Throughout this year of not dating we've come close to getting back together multiple times and our relationship has been a roller coaster. So a few days ago she asked me to pick her up from a party she supposedly was not enjoying. So i went to pick her up, and ended up getting invited in to hangout. So we stayed at the party and she ended up coming on to me and we hooked up. After hooking up we joined the party again and held hands all night and acted like we would if we were dating. I took her home and she kissed me before she left. Next day it continued, we hung out and cuddled, texted like we were together, and again she kissed me when i took her home. After that day she started to act weird giving me mixed signals about her feelings for another ex that she just broke up with and myself, as we continued to act like we were dating. 

I then couldn't take it anymore and asked her if she wants to seriously date me or if we're just messing around. She responded with for now shes gunna say we're just friends and she just wants to have fun being single. I then expressed that I wanted to date her again, but said if she wanted we can continue like this till she wants to date. She then randomly asked ""do you still love me?"". I said yea i still care about you. I then asked her if she still loves me and she said ""idk..."" and the conversation ended with her going to bed. 

I'm not sure how to handle this situation because many situations similar to this with her being unsure but acting like she wants to date have happened throughout this year of us not being together and I do want to date her.

*Thanks again!*

____________________________________________________________________________________________


Me[F23] and my boyfriend [23] have been together for 4 years, living together for 3 years. 
From the beginning I noticed that he is very dependent on someone running his life. I liked being in charge of that until it started bugging me about 9 months ago. I've been thinking and talking about it a lot, now I need a new point of view.


My problems with him:

- He only does chores when I explicitly tell him to and remind him a couple of times (like a child)

- He forgets to eat when I don't make food - like a child (thats a problem because he wants to gain weight and I want to lose it, i can't cook and not eat it)

- He is extremely lazy, he even sucks out my energy and motivation... I'm much lazier as I used to be (did all kinds of sports before I met him, exercised 5-6 times a week) now it's a miracle when I take a longer walk once a week

- He interrupts me when I talk and sometimes tells my punchline (all wrong might I add!). I almost freak out when this happens because for me it's a clear sign of lacking respect (his father does interrupt bf's mother all the time and generally is not respecting women at all)


My problems with myself:

- Everyone (but me) seems to think that I'm the reacher and he's the settler (HIMYM anyone?)

- I seem to be incapable to change things on my own

- I don't have many friends and have no idea how to find some

- I've never had a charming personality and have no idea how to change that. You know the kind: introvert, self-defensive humor, smart-assery. (My bf is the opposite: he seems to have that certain something, everyone loves him after ten seconds. I am green with envy because it's so easy for him.)


Our problems with each other:

- I love talking about theories (almost doesn't matter which field it is from: life in general, physics, religion (I'm an Atheist), psychology...) and try to analyse our relationship a lot(reacher-settler, the concept of soulmates, fate...) or the ones of mine/his parents to avoid traps and improve our everyday life. His opinion about that kind of stuff is 'that's all nonsense' (no discussion). So I talk to my Mom about it and he then gets mad 'because I'm talking crap again'.

- I want to experience life, you have to have bad times so you know when you have good ones... he doesn't really like trying new things (unless he researched it to death and is certain it's going to be great), not even watching a bad movie or trying new food.

- I want my life to be exciting and I want to travel the world, he seems to be scared of change. Moving to a different apartment is a waste of time and money, foreign countries are dangerous, ...

- I want to move to a different country after graduation and if I don't like it, I'll move again. He agrees that we will do that (at least the initial move) but I have no idea (and neither does he) if he agreed to move because he wants to, too or because he doesn't want to be 'left behind'.



My problem in general is that I feel very old and 'set in my ways' and I'm afraid I'll miss the best time of my life. (Because we never moved away from home seperately, we spend too much time together,...)

I suspect that I'm projecting some of my flaws and fears onto him so I don't have to blame myself if something fails. I really would appreciate some opinions and maybe some advice on any of my 99 problems.

1362730988.0,9,self.relationship_tips,19wif5,[23m] Girls that return my interest in them treat me like a cure for their imperfect relationship,11,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/19wif5/23m_girls_that_return_my_interest_in_them_treat/,"I have the following problem which I simply cannot resolve by myself.
After my last girlfriend with whom I have been together for 2 years has dumped me (which was 2 years ago) anytime I show interest in a girl and it's mutual they treat me as a cure for the problems that occur in their relationships. Let me elaborate:

1. First girl. Let's call her A. I met her during an univeristy lecture. We quickly hit it off pretty well. We really enjoyed each others company. About a month into our acquaintance I have found out she has a boyfriend. I was shocked because her behaviour stated otherwise. I tried to back down (I even told her that) but it happened so that she asked me to come to another lecture to meet with here. And from there things went crazy. I often came to her flat where we snuggled (several times we've done that in my car because of her roommates). I felt terrible but I went on. She often brought up the problems she had with her boyfriend (apparently I was able to make her horny but not him - and not only that). When I finally gathered courage to tell her that she has to choose she broke down crying and our relationship broke off soon after that.

2. Girl B. I've known her for a relatively long time. I've even been told several times that we should be together because we would make a good couple (even though she's conservative Christian and I'm an atheist). I knew she had a boyfriend and I did not want to repeat what has just happened. But I did. On multiple occassions she criticised her boyfriend and complained about his behaviour - he is the least ambitious person I've ever known. When he finally saw that their relationship is going downhill he proposed to her parents (who agreed). Then she was torn between me and him. When I firmly asked her to make a decision she went to the guy to break up with him. She came back with a handwritten letter which stated that although I am a good person she does not love me and wants to be with her boyfriend till the end of the world.

3. Girl C. I met her about a year ago. Suddenly she messaged me that we should hang out sometime. I agreed. We had a good time and we decided that we should meet again. Then I found out that she has a boyfriend. I did not hesitate to break off the contact. Naturally, she messaged me inquiring why am I not writing to her at all. She also wrote me that she's no longer with her boyfriend. I met with her, we had a good time. After that she took several days to write back whenever I messaged her. She invited me over to her flat where we talked for several hours. We went to a party to my friends. I was invited again but this time she told me between the lines that she's again with her boyfriend (whom she criticised and complained about). Jokingly she said that's she's also been hit on by some random dude at a party. I couldn't take it. I asked her 3 times whether she really is in relationship again and then I left. Upon leaving she even asked me whether we'll go for a coffee next week. I did not respond. 

I am quite ambitious person. I try to get the best grades at uni. I work part time. I help fellow students with classes. I partake in extracurricular activities. I am not handsome nor ugly, rather the average bloke, I regularly do pushups, squats and on weekends I hit the gym (though I'm not athletic - my lifestyle makes it hard to organise a well balanced diet). 

I don't understand why it's happening to me. It's making my self-esteem so low that I have really dark thoughts. I stopped believing that any woman will ever want to be with me. What should I/can I do to avoid situations like that?

tl;dr Each time I hook up with a girl I find out that's she's with a piece of a trash boyfriend. When I ask them to make a decision they always choose the boyfriend over me. Also, it's not that I intentionally ""target"" exclusively girls that are with someone at the time.

Oh well. 

Anywho, I'm in a sticky situation with my SO that I don't even deserve to be with. Early on in the relationship (1.5 years), my immature friends constantly belittled her and made her feel unattractive (she's not). Additionally, the girl who I went to prom with senior year in highschool constantly was talking/flirting to me online, which she learned about. Although my SO is a really cute girl, this other girl I went to prom with is also very cute. My SO constantly compares herself to prom girl and sees herself as insignificant compared to her. She recently had an incident at a party where, well, I guess copypasting her facebook status describes how she felt the best...

""when guys want to sleep with you, you get: free food, free alcohol, free weed and you'll never get called for elbows when playing beer pong. when you're a ""cool girl"" you get to stay sober at parties and make sure no one kills themselves. looks like i need to re-evaluate my life choices, time to break out the push-up bras and vagina-length skirts""

Because of what happened in the past (I told the prom girl to fuck off about 6-7 months ago, my friends now think she's awesome) these past actions still affect her now, and she literally views herself as insignificant and unattractive. She means the fucking world to me and seeing her like this, constantly self-berating and lacking confidence in herself - really makes me feel guilty as fuck.

I've tried everything I can to make her feel attractive - I constantly tell her how pretty she is, how I love seeing her in the mornings bundled up against me with no makeup on, how she has a really nice butt, etc. But all she does in response to this is reference the past and continue degrading herself.

tl;dr - Shitty things happened in the first 6 months of relationship to make my SO feel like she was unattractive - one year later and I still can't make her understand that she is the cutest girl ever. wat do

I just thought reddit might have more ideas to help me make this beautiful woman in my life feel confident and attractive, like she really is. Thanks.

LONG,9,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/15m55t/19m_made_my_girlfriend_20_crack_about_making_out/,"My girlfriend of 2 and a half years has been texting this guy day and night always picking him up and always doing things for him. Flirting obviously I told them both to stop they agreed. I also asked to look through her phone to see their conversations, I was very uncomfortable with what I read after her hesitation to let me read. Couple days go by it slowly starts to drive me mad. She got piss drunk tonight and while I was taking care of her I went through her phone. They hadn't stopped flirting in fact it got worse. She wasn't the one advocating the ""let's cuddle"" or similar text's but she wasn't pushing him away either. Obvious winky faces and hearts confirmed that not to mention the ""okay"". After she sobered up I confronted her about it. I told her straight up I looked through her phone because It was justified. I mentioned how they hadn't stopped flirting and what was really going I HAD to know. After much pressure she cracked to making out with him the other night but that's it she says..I believe it because it added up because there was another person in the room(or so she says) I doubt it went any farther. She hid it from me, I asked her why she did it and she said she didn't know what got over her. I asked her if she wanted me or him she said she didn't know but couldn't trust herself around him. After talking and a lot of tears we explained to each other why this was happening(I kept my cool this whole time) from what I understand she had the typical ""We're really young and I don't know what else is out there I need to know for myself but I don't want to lose you if I'm wrong"" I agreed to us spending a day apart for her to gather her feelings. But this was all at a get together where this other guy was at. He wound up being a super dick to her she got upset and he tried to call her over to him but she didn't go, she left with me to go back to my house to talk more. A lot of more tears shed she admits how much of a ""stupid bitch"" she is. She has a problem with pulling her hair. She explained how being with him that she wasn't doing it. She clings on to me telling me she doesn't want to lose me but I told her simply I can't trust her. She needs her own friends as do I we share a lot of the same friends. She says she never gets to do ""Me"" and wants to know what it's like. I cracked to her telling her some of my insecuritys and now she says she doesn't need the time apart but I had her make plans for tomorrow night without me. I don't want to be selfish and try to control her and keep her. But at the same time I don't want this happening all again. All in all I'm glad she just made out with him and nothing more. She vouches to be a better girlfriend and work on her issues I told her she doesn't respect herself at all. Sorry for this really long text but this happened over a long time span, from about 830pm to 1230am. I will added other details as they are needed.

**TL;DR** = I'm pretty much batman and found out the obvious truth that my GF has been flirting with another guy pressured her and she cracked to hooking up with him. And I need to know what's best for me and her.

**UPDATE:** I've never had to deal with something like this before I've never known this pain. I just want to talk it out with her so badly. I feel like I need her. She was all about taking time before this guy starting being an asshole to her. Do you think she learned her lesson? She's constantly tweeting that she's thinking about me that she fucked up. Our good friend told me that she stopped talking to this guy.

I'm going to try and paraphrase our text conversation. She says she really wants my trust she can't deal with this shes becoming a ""fucking wreck"" she says shes can't lose me. She doesn't want me to give up on her, she says if she has me she'll remember this one time that she fucked up and she'll never hurt me like that again. ""I want to do it for you baby"" She says that she needs me in the type of situations with other people otherwise she'll be ""taken advantage of"" She feels that she has to fix this or it will kill her on the inside to see the guy she loves so much be hurt by her she needs me and im the guy she wants to help her from herself..She says she's glad i invaded her privacy and she needed me to and im so right about everything.

M26 and F25.,10,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/13qt0r/remaining_friends_after_a_longterm_breakup_m26/,"My girlfriend broke up with me about 2 months ago. Its a complicated story, but we had been together for 4 years and she just decided that we weren't exactly compatible any more (for a bunch of reasons). It was EXTREMELY hard to come to terms with this, I had just given her a ring a few months earlier. I learned a lot, but still feel we're a great fit.

We have remained in contact since the break up (I moved out of our apartment) and we talk about once a week about different things. I plead for her to come out and see my new apartment or grab a drink and she'll say ""not yet"" or things like that. She's basically waiting for me to get over her, we both know I'm not. 

I found out yesterday she has been seeing someone new for about 4 weeks- as you might imagine this is fucking heartbreaking. Finding this out feels worse than the initial breakup. Someone ELSE having feelings for her, and her actually encouraging it. You know the deal. Its killing me inside.

I believe in this girl. I believe I could marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. She has told me that the door isn't closed and that she does really want to remain friends, because I'm still a very positive influence in her life. This guy is new, my worst fear is that they will begin a new relationship that lasts a long time.

So my question is this: how can I remain in her life and show her that I'm really the man she wants- without it seeming like I'm trying to tear them apart?  I really want to keep a relationship with her, partly to say FU to the new guy, like I haven't left yet because I haven't and I don't plan on it.

My first approach was to ""give it some time"" and give her some distance, well guess what, she fucking found this guy in that time. 

Just looking for the best outcome here.. meaning I still want to be as close to her as possible, even if I can't be her boyfriend at this time.  Like I said at this point I'm thinking long-term, as in, I will wait for her through whatever happens because I love her that much.  

I can give more detail in the comments but I'm happy to hear any advice you guys might be able give!! and really appreciate it if you read it all!

",10,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/13fpzn/xpostrelationships_my_m25_so_f25_of_7_years_feels/,"
I’m [M25] and my SO [F25]. We’ve been in a relationship for 7 years.

A bit of background: [I provide more details about our sexual dynamic as I think our problem is rooted in sexual matters]

We have both grown up in the same middle eastern country. We’re both educated and very secular and despite having to carry on a relationship in a religious society we tried to make it work. The major issue in our relationship was sex. Sex before marriage isn’t socially acceptable where we are from, and it would be nearly impossible to find a certain place at a time where we could actually try it. That wasn’t easy, and it led to us not being able to have sex until a year and a half into the relationship, despite continuous efforts from both sides. 

I was her first and I feel like she was my first because my previous encounters were not significant. Even after we started doing it, we could only do it as often as once a month because of the lack of places and times to do it. We weren’t able to do it as much as a couple should normally do and it wasn’t in a carefree and relaxed environment. It would be similar to you trying to have sex within one block of the white house without being seen. This lead to a lot of stress.

We both moved to Canada to both obtain Master’s degrees. The university that accepted me was in Toronto, and hers was in Montreal. As a requirement for my program, I was required to stay in Toronto for an entire 4 month semester. Upon finishing the semester, I moved to Montreal to live with her. The whole reason that I am studying in Canada is for her. I actually had multiple better opportunities in the states, but I chose our relationship over these opportunities. She on the other hand did not sacrifice anything, because her program in Montreal was the best opportunity for her; she just chose what was best for her. If I were to quantify the opportunities that I missed: I would have graduated already, in a program that I preferred to the one I am currently in, and worked, making over $10,000. The food costs were split equally, but I was forced to only contribute $300 a month for rent, whereas she would contribute $500 for rent. There was an understanding between us that I could only contribute that amount towards the rent because my university was actually in Toronto, and since I was not living in Toronto, I wasn’t able to get a job at the university.

In regards to my studies. I was able to structure my studies in a way that I could do most of them without actually travelling to Toronto. 

Later on I found out that she didn’t really want to move in yet but she did it anyway because it was financially the only way we could make it work at the time. I, on the other hand, had no problem moving in and loved the whole experience.

We lived together, the sex was good at times, average other times and sometimes not good at all, but overall, average. I have always put more effort in during sex to pleasure her (than she does to pleasure me) as she doesn’t reach orgasm easily and I feel as if it is because of her oppressed past, she should be able to enjoy it as much as physically possible now that we live in a healthier society. I feel that she didn’t reciprocate my efforts. You can imagine that at this point we gradually started to feel less excited sexually. Sex became a chore on my part, I felt as if I always had to bring more sexual excitement to her, while knowing that it was not not going to work, because she’s not mentally excited, and I don’t seem to be able to get her excited while she desperately needed me to. 

This was the biggest problem in the relationship for her. I did lots of research, still do. Talk to people, get advice. For the first year of living together, the sex was average, 4-5 times a week, and I didn’t feel that anything was off; there was no indication of any dissatisfaction. Minor indications were her not orgasming every single time, and having a bad mood after sex. 1 year into living together, she started to demand more and better sex, constantly being dissatisfied and asking me to put more effort into it. Later she asked me to lose weight, get more in shape (I was 165 lbs), and research about general sexual pleasures, roleplay, fetishes, and etc. I would research this for 1-2 hours a week, and after talking to her. After I researched, and tried hard for this, she told me that I wasn’t doing enough. I really don’t know what I could have done better.

A year and four months into living together (last April, which just more than half a year ago), she gave me an ultimatum to either have sex with her 10 times a week or she would end the relationship. 

She’s a sexual girl and wants it all the time. But at the same time she needs me to work on it and properly arouse her, with long foreplay, massages and oral pleasures, often leading to 30-45 minutes of foreplay, entailing kissing her on the neck, dirty talk, spanking, massaging her breasts, playing with her clit, play with her hair, change foreplay positions, and many more. I did my best, though sometimes reluctantly being pessimistic as to the effectiveness of all this, because after I already tried so hard, it only got harder to satisfy her. We discussed alternatives, like threesomes, and we both actively sought out other people for this. Our collaborative decision was not to go through with it because the people that we could find were dirty slobs that would most likely have a slew of STDs. How could we trust them? We knew several couples and other people, but no eligible candidate. We try to be sexually open-minded, so it’s come up frequently, that if anyone of us is ever in a situation where sex with someone else is imminent, we are allowed to do that, since YOLO and etc. Of course, I don’t need to have sex with someone else on the side, because she’s hot and perfect and even though she doesn’t put so much effort in bed, still I have nothing to complain; I come every time, she doesn’t.

This was our situation 5 months ago.Then I left Canada to pay my parents a visit for a month. She was busy with her master’s thesis. I returned and she seemed stressed, and she finally cracked up to what is going on with her. She admitted that she has never been ready to move in and that she needs space. She pretty much kicked me out. I found a place in half a day and moved out quickly, seeing as she was on a tight deadline for her thesis and I didn’t want to put more emotional load on her. For the same token, I didn’t react as intensely as someone who’s just been kick out would react. I didn’t want to break up but if she could cope with it, I would probably have shown my unhappiness to this recent setback in our relationship by not returning her phone calls for a few days or other usual stuff, or even more. But I didn’t.

I moved to this sort of party house, because it was cheap, for a month and in the meanwhile I visited her and she visited me frequently, and the sex was better than it has been in our entire relationship, although I was repressing my unhappiness about the whole thing the whole time. The constant parties and the weed and beer calmed me down a bit, but to this day I carry that emotional baggage of being kicked out, because I never got to express it properly.

I needed to move to Toronto temporarily for my program. I stayed at her place for a week during my transition, because I couldn’t find a place quickly enough. I considered myself and behaved as a guest while staying with her, though she treated me as I was living there again, saying that she was wrong and she loves living with me. I was still unhappy, partly because I didn’t think she was sincere, maybe because I was leaving soon anyway.

I moved to Toronto mid-September, and now this has temporarily become a long distance relationship. She visited me once in October for a weekend, and I visited her two times, for a couple of days each, one to celebrate her birthday. I was still trying hard, just like I always was, I talked to her over skype for at least 2 hours every day, I even made her a birthday card myself, putting a lot of time and effort into it; I did things like this often. The sex is better than ever. Everything seemed good, until her mom came to visit her and it brought up a whole lot of stuff from her past.

Now we get to last night. We had a talk. She told me that being close to her mom drives her crazy because it reminds her constantly how much she doesn’t want to be like her. Of course, one of the qualities her mom has is that she’s only been with one man her whole life, and that she’s kind of prudish.

(Quick side note here, her parents don’t strike me as prudes since they are both medical doctors, educated and very open-minded and they never even commented on the fact that we were living together. In any case, this is how she characterizes her mom)

She started the conversation by telling me about how her mom makes her feel and how much she doesn’t want to be like her. And then she tells me that she knows she’s wrong but she can’t help but feel deep down that I’m making her old like her mom, and that she doesn’t want to get old having been with one guy her whole life, and that she’s feeling older and less sexual and she feels like she’s missing out on sexual experiences, being with me.

I was shocked. I came there to talk about regular daily stuff with her. My first reaction was silence as I was digesting what it meant. The second thing that popped into my head was that I should shave this goddamn November truckstache I’m growing, as it’s embarrassing. I grew it for her because she told me that a moustache would bring variety to her sex life. After I came out of the mustache coma, I responded by saying: we shouldn’t be together, it doesn’t make sense. Of course she was acting distraught and taking back her words on account of being on her period and having her mom visit and me being far away from her geographically. But the fact is, this is not the first time, similar conversations have come up, and I feel and know that on some level she thinks like that, although she might be reluctant to admit it all the time, because we are otherwise a perfect couple. I tried to prove to her that she goes back on what she says when she feels like what she said is hurting me. She would tell me that she feels old being with me, she feels like her mother; 
and then she would apologize and tell me that she said that because she was on her period. I ended up saying that I won’t call her, but she’s free to call me. I want her to make her own decisions. I want her to call me of her own accord and be the one to tell me “I want this relationship”. I want her to have a choice and make a choice. 

It’s been a day, I haven’t shaved the truckstache. She called me multiple times this morning, and tried to blame everything on her period. I’m not buying it. I feel that the things that she said are actually what she feels. I’m stressed now because the deadline to finish my Master’s program is the end of December. I feel as if I took a break, or didn’t answer my phone, she would break up with me. 

Should I let her go? Or push her enough to break up with me?  Should I stay with her, seeing as first she wants me out and then she feels trapped? I love her and she loves me. But we’re both of the same idea that relationships are bound to end. She hates the concept of marriage and so do I.

What do you think?

I have had some 'friends'. But when I moved on from secondary school to university and started to live on my own (no college, no dormitories here in this country), I discovered that most contacts had grown out of habit: when you spend all your days with the same people in one room, you get some contact. However, I realise that I've never had real deep friendship. I am okay at the superficial stuff and get along with people quite well. I do not hate myself, I do not hate other people, I am not awkward in public, I just don't connect, my contact with other people always stays superficial. The only exception is one other guy with the same age, but we only meet like once every two months and he has his own friends and all initiative comes from my side.

I'm starting to feel pretty lonely. I've taken steps to counter my loneliness: I've joined a team sport, go to political events and sing in a choir. But I still don't get any friends out of it. This may partially be due to the fact that I am not into partying and drinking and have broadly eccentric interests.

My bf [31] and I [f, 25] met last year around mid-December, and had sex for the first time end on January this year. I was away for almost a month after we first met, so my bf doesn't usually count anything before we had sex. We were technically ""still dating other people"" before then but neither of us got much action to be honest (well I didn't, I think Mr. Stud over there might have). We later went through a stage where we retroactively started to date other people to slow things down between us (this time I did some dating, he didn't really).

We started to acknowledged boyfriend/girlfriend status over a span of a couple of weeks around end of May, but it wasn't spontaneous. I don't know when it happened, but we're in a ""serious"" relationship now (no complaints!).

So I was just curious when would be the right time to surprise him with a home-cooked meal or some such thing. Thoughts?

She is afraid she will never be able to show true emotion, be vulnerable, or let down her guard around anyone.

We've both discussed that this will create problems, as I may eventually feel like she truly doesn't love me and that she will never truly let herself be vulnerable around me. It isn't a trust issue, as she has told me so and has shown that she trusts me a great deal.

What if they are easily lead by others, bending to social pressures, and someone else acted upon them to pull them into their spell.

What if they're just sick? A personality disorder only you can see because you've been with them for years. Although it tears you up inside, and is like trying to coordinate business partnership with a dog, if you care for them, how is cutting them out of your protective wing the right thing to do?

The relationship may be disordered, but if the person is disordered, then it's a symptom of their psychological problems, and they need help. It's preferable if everyone can partner up with perfect people, but that's not reality. Various mental deficits are all around, and if we all just cast the people with problems out they're left to bounce around harming themselves, and others they get involved with.

If you are stable in a way they are not, if you are in control and know how to not lie, how to keep trust, and channel your physical acts safely, then aren't you the best candidate to be cheated on? Isn't this a good opportunity for you to love someone who needs your love most? If they end up with someone like them, they'll be even more lost because neither will have any clue how to avoid disasters.

Although there may be a certain level of force involved, more work, and emotional discomforts, isn't it a valid option to embrace someone who broke your trust? To instead of doing what your instinct suggests in pushing them out with vengeance, you pull them in tight and secure them from their own insecurities?

It's not a pleasant idea to be likened to an infantile role, where you need someone to watch over you. But some people simply do, don't they? Some people lie, and don't understand how that works, how its toxicity will poison the foundation of human relations. They're lost following a disfigured pathway of feelings, that inevitably leads to pain and chaos.

They're lost, confused, even when they believe they aren't. Even if they feel justified, and think they're deciding for them, it's not just selfishness, it's a mistake, it's a misunderstanding, it's evidence of psychological disorder.

Isn't turning on them similarly immature and dysfunctional as what they did? To be the best person, shouldn't you control your gut response, and use your reasoning to reorganize with what you've got? Afterall, isn't their cheating itself driven by such shortsighted and lazy emotional drives?

Recently (last year or so), it seems like everyone's girlfriend has broken up with them (aged 20-24 yrs). In each instance, the girl doesn't have specific reasons, but seems to simply be over the relationship. They consider the guy their ""best friend"" or want to stay close, but seem ready to move on.
The guys seem to stay hung up on the girl for pretty long periods of time, while the girls are just ready to move on. I know that each relationship has its own dynamics, but it seems like there is a trend. Could it be that the girls are at a point in their life where they want to see what else is out there, while the guys are content. Or, have the guys somehow become pacified and emasculated, making them less attractive.
I ask this, because I'm amongst these guys and am trying to figure out my situation and more generally the psychology behind what is going on. My (24 m) ex (21 f) and I were together for 3 years, but have been going back and forth for the past year or two (five years total).

anyway: i stress communication like no other in a relationship. ive seen so many problems, tears, and broken hearts over words that were never said or things that were provoked out of spite. So when something is bothering me i like to let her know and she seems to be very appreciative of this (her ex was that stereotypical ""theres nothing wrong with me, i dont need help, im a man blah blah blah"" kinda guys lol) however she has a hard time expressing herself a lot of time, especially on some tender subjects like sex.
 To use an example, as a sexually active couple we will go weeks or ever in excess of a month of time without ANY sexual interaction. Now im not bothered by this (she was my first) and would happily hold off and bide my time if i knew something was bothering her. When i hear ""i just havent been in the mood"" as the excuse to account for 6 weeks of a dry spell- i feel im not 100% in the wrong getting a little suspicious (i acknowledge that im a little on the jealous side but thats a story for another time) 
As well, i know full well she needs her own time and despite how much i love spending time with her its not right to be together ALL THE TIME. But she will frequently complain (i use that word loosely) about how she never has time to herself, shes always working or with someone, and doesnt have down time. Yet i feel if i 'left her alone' i would be coming off neglectful and seem like im avoiding her. ive told her time and time again that i wont be offended if she flat out said ""i dont wanna see you- i want an alone day"" but she never does. Yet when she does muster the time for one, someone walks in and interrupts it (usually her ex who we are both still very close friends with) and we're back at square one.

before i continue to ramble- is there any advise you can give me to help ENCOURAGE her (notice im not implying force- i want it to be on her own) to talk to me and open up a little bit? 

PS i do believe this isnt a distrust in me, im sure its part of her personality since she doesnt confide in her friends either.

finally she knows i discuss us and things on here from time to time, so if the ladies here have any 1st hand advise and want to talk directly to her i will gladly show her.

(EDIT): Before this becomes a topic- i do have a few reservations about the whole exbf being in the picture thing, but given the amount of skepticism i feel- i attribute it to partially my own jealousy and partially the natural jealousy you feel for a former love. (i dont believe im too jealous per say or negatively influenced on it)

Here goes...

To give some background I'm a 21(M) and she is 19(F) and we both attend the same university. It is a smaller school with around 5000-7500 students so you get to know most people around campus. Anyway, we started dating right before the school year ended in the beginning of May and have been ""dating"" since so this puts as dating for about 4 months. I put dating in quotations because we aren't official yet, but we are mostly exclusive and have been seeing each other quite a bit over the past 4 months. We live about an hour and a half away from each other, but because she doesn't have her license, I have been driving to visit her. We always have a great time and I really fucking love hanging out with her.

Sex is a big part of any relationship, and we have had a decent sex life for the most part. In the beginning, when we both had the freedom of school, we were able to have sex whenever at my apartment. Due to other circumstances...(she's staying with relatives and working at a job) whenever I visited we weren't able to really engage physically...This hasn't been a problem though and I really like her and I...I hope... the feeling are reciprocated on her part.

One thing that has been on the back of my mind is that every time we talk on the phone, she mentions how she is planning on transferring at the end of the year. Now the problem here is that I had hoped for a relationship of some sort, but the fact that she IS transferring, pretty much without question. Why does she keep telling me this. From all of her other actions, she has seemed like she wants the same thing from our relationship as I do, but she wants to move away. I don't want to give the impression that I don't want her to transfer because of me, but its almost like I KNOW that this relationship will fail, so why put anything into it. The biggest problem here is that she is the first girl that I have dated like this before and I have a huge fear of really falling in love with this girl and just having her leave me in the dust...

tldr; girl I have been dating has told me numerous times that she plans to transfer at the end of this school year. I don't want to fall in love just to have her leave me back at our university

Had a super messy breakup years back, and since then I've kind of just focused on my friends, my family and my career. I generally have a lack of confidence I'd like to say is rooted deeply in the fallout from my last relationship, but I'd like some thoughts on what I'm currently going through.

I have a friend who I went to college with (we'll call her H), a year my junior. A quick side note on her is that she dated one of my friends, but that too ended messily. This is not a fact I am concerned with, though I do consider the fact it might be weird for her.

We've always been good friends, and I've always thought she was adorable. Not to get gooey, but I've always considered her a type that I could see myself with, but never really pursued it as an interest due to the aforementioned reasons. Anyways, we don't live/work in the same towns, but we keep in touch and visit when possible now that college is over and we are both working.

She came up and visited me for my birthday earlier this spring. Of course as the birthday boy, my friends decided that all drinks were on them. One thing led to another, and my friend and I hooked up. I didn't think anything of it at the time, really, just that I hated the fact that I was ""that guy"" sucking face in the middle of a bar around closing time.

I started thinking after that moment that what if it wasn't rooted purely in drunken lack of inhibitions? I've never been a fan of long distance relationships (one of the reasons that forced my last relationship spiraled into disaster). I wouldn't really consider just under 2 hours ""long distance"" as it's an easy after-work drive. Granted, I'm not considering her thoughts/opinions on this matter, but I'm getting there.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I am going down to visit a mutual friend for their birthday. I know my friend is going to be there, and we are both looking forward to seeing one another. Being young adults who drink, we had our pregame at our friend's house then hit the bars. Countless drinks later, I'm drunk but coherent, and I'm being led by the hand outside by ""H"". She leads me around a corner to a generally empty street (it's nearly 2 AM), and proceeds to just look at me and go in for a kiss. I oblige. It continues for a moment, before we take a step back and think about it. Neither of us says anything for a good ten seconds before it resumes, but much more intensely than before. 

Obviously the thoughts running through my head at the moment are ""Is she just super drunk?"" or ""What is this all about?"". I am extremely attracted her to physically, but it's always been about being friends up until this point. 

We eventually grab a cab, head to her house, and she proceeds to lead me upstairs and we have sex. I'm drunk, she's drunk, I'm still not sure what the thought process was, but she was clearly in command here (not that I mind of course). Needless to say I started to sober up and decided it was best I didnt stay the night, for fear I'd wake up to the worst case scenario (her ""WTFing!"")

I woke up at my other friend's house to a text basically asking what happened last night. I wanted to meet her in person, as it was probably something that should've been discussed, but unfortunately I had to drive home. I called her as soon as I made it back and told her. We both agreed it was kind of crazy. She expressed feelings of worry, especially that she took advantage of me (which I tried to remind her that she did not, and that it takes two to tango). She kept asking me if I was okay and are we still friends. I told her there was nothing that could have happened that erase our friendship. I told her I was fine. I couldn't really find the words to express how I felt. I was actually kind of glad. I posed the same question to her and she responded with ""Would it be weird to say that I am okay with it?"". I didn't really think about the phrase much at the time, and I may be reading too much into it, but is it possible that alcohol may have let some underlying feelings bubble to the surface? Is it possible that I really have felt this way all along, but being the slightly damaged goods that I consider myself to be that I didn't allow myself to just say ""fuck it"" and feel what I want to feel?

1339467158.0,7,self.relationship_tips,ux7p2,In light of all the cheating posts: It seems to me that there are two types of cheaters who commit different classes of crimes. Your thoughts?,7,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/ux7p2/in_light_of_all_the_cheating_posts_it_seems_to_me/,"I have noticed an influx in ""I cheated - what do I do?"" posts and have come to realize that these posts can be categorized into two separate classes. We have the chronic, likely sociopath, looking-for-trouble-all-the-time cheater, and we have the accidentally-fucked-up-once-probably-drunk cheater who's remorse is nearly insurmountable. Of course, there are different situations with each relationship that come into play, but take this scenario for example:

A couple has been dating for two years. One party creates an online dating profile and cheats on his/her significant other at least once per month. Though he/she feels a little bad, the behavior does not cease.

IMO, this person needs to fess up and likely be left.

However, let's look at another couple who's also been together for two years. One party has no past of cheating or any malicious intent and has too much to drink (blackout drunk). He/she ends up cheating on the other individual, but WAS NOT looking for it. Of course the cheater in this situation will feel a great amount of guilt and realize that the relationship was put at risk. The cheater is presented with two options, confess or don't. Either way the relationship is not compromised and the two stay together in the end.

Option A, confess: The individual confesses his/her indiscretions and a great argument arises. The opposite party feels betrayed, and a small seed of distrust is planted. In this case, the relationship is like fine china and can be glued back together but cannot hold as much pressure as before. Every time the cheater goes out on his/her own, the partner wonders and arguments are frequent. Every time pressure is added, the relationship grows weaker and cannot be the same.

Option B, don't: Though the guilt and remorse are mounting, the cheater keeps the indiscretion to them self. He/she learns from it, solidifying what limits they may have and avoiding them in the future. This allows them to become a better person and (eventually) ultimately make the relationship stronger through self-growth.

I think this is the idea that those who stand by the idea of not confessing to a one-time screw up stand behind. What do you think?

My first major, but tumultuous (1.5 years on/off, both in our early 20s), relationship ended last month. Every story about a partner's mistreatment reminds me of him, and I'm starting to recognize that conflicting emotions surface.

On the one hand, I am realizing exactly how horrible he was to me, and how I can act on the warning signs earlier on in the future. On the other hand, our entire relationship was built on his mistreatment of me, and of course, like a human being, I miss him/our relationship to bits. However, I don't want to mix up those feelings by ultimately missing his mistreatment of me.

I want to know what I have to look forward to when I finally heal and grow up some more. I want to know how other people have healthy relationships, and I want to know how it feels to be in one.

When we first started seeing each other, she made it clear that she just wanted an open relationship and to date. Having never been in that situation for very long, I was unsure what exactly that meant.  

After some serious thinking and talking, I'm finally getting used to being in an open relationship and what my expectations ought to be. I gotta say, I feel mentally more comfortable and healthier after really reevaluating my (initially clingy) feelings and just knowing I have someone to share some of my life with while being casually involved. We talk every day and get to see each other roughly 2 weekends a month, and while I wish it was more, our lives are too demanding.   

  At the same time, I just met someone who lives in a closer city who I've hit it off with. We'll call her 'Jess'.
  
  So as it became more clear that I'm probably going to see Jess this weekend, possibly resulting in sex, I felt a little guilty. I care deeply about Kelly and she knows it. I've also been open with Jess that I'm dating someone else. I suppose I was looking for boundaries and wanted to make sure I didn't hurt Kelly.
  
  I talked to Kelly and told her that I care about her more than anyone and I want to be honest and not hurt her or cheat on her. I told her I met someone last weekend who I've been talking to but don't want to lead on. At this, Kelly responded respectfully that she didn't want to hear about my other dates and that emotions and jealousy over your partners actions on those weekends that we're not together are exactly why she didn't want a committed relationship. While I was hoping we'd draw the line somewhere before intercourse, she said that ""I could do anything"" with Jess. I think it affected her a little to hear I was talking to someone else, but she actively doesn't want to have those kind of feelings because they hurt and aren't practical given our situation.
  
I just want to make sure Kelly's okay and knows that she's more special to me than Jess. If I put myself in her position, I think I'd be hurt, especially if it involved her sleeping with other dudes. 

 What can I do? What should I do? Should I just chill and keep going?

As a female, I have always thought that if someone really digs their SO they would want everyone in their social circle (friends and family included) to know about their SO and introduce him/ her to said social circle.  If a guy/ girl is unwilling to incorporate SO into their social circle I would assume  that they might not be very serious about their SO/ care for them deeply. 

Is there any other reason why people wouldn't want to introduce their SO to their friends especially if they've been dating him/ her for a length of time ( 6 months and longer)?

Would just like second opinions on this. 

Edit: This is not a situation that reflect my current relationship personally however it does reflect my brother's and my close friend's relationship. I just found it weird that at 1.5 years my brother hasn't introduced any of his friends ( mostly guys) to his gf while she has tried to introduce him to all of her friends/ family.  Our family is a bit more spread out so it's more difficult to introduce her to them.  

As for my friend.. she's been in a 4 year relationship with this guy.. and still hasn't been introduced to any of his friends except for one by accident.  I'm not so concerned for my brother as I am concerned for my friend. I wanted to know whether I was justified in thinking that something might be a bit off when a guy/girl doesn't introduce their friends to their SOs for an extended period of time.  She has asked me if its weird that she doesn't know any of her bf's friends and I did tell her something was off but was not sure if my initial feelings were justified.

The reason why I want to know is to advise my friend on this matter as she perceives her current bf as a potential marriage partner.  As a friend I feel like it's my duty to warn her about red flags and to deal with them appropriately. Just wondering how concerned she and I should be if even after 4 years of dating she hasn't been introduced to any of his friends.

Waller developed the theory after observing many dating couples at Penn State, where he noticed that romantic partners usually had unequal degrees of emotional involvement. He claimed that if the inequity became too large, one partner would be in a position to exploit the other emotionally. It’s a variation on supply and demand theory. In fact, although the concept was articulated specifically to relate to relationships, it has over time become an economic principle as well, applied frequently to negotiation and marketing strategy.

As much as I hate to admit this, the aforementioned theory makes a lot of sense in regards to my past and current relationships. Just for context, I'm a 23 year old female and I'm dating several guys non-exclusively.

It seems like a lot of girls I know tend to find great success casting themselves in the role of Least Interested Party to gain the upper hand. The theory goes that by seeming difficult to attain, men will put forth more effort. The problem with this approach is that once the woman allows herself to be “caught,” she either becomes easy to hold onto (and is right back where she started), or must constantly play a game of one upsmanship to keep the guy interested (...my feminist friends would slaughter me for this post). Also, I tend to err on the side of honesty, and so if I'm interested in someone I generally will express it. I just don't really understand how all of these games are supposed to be played.

I've encountered that problem with boyfriends before, but they always seemed to need more sleep than I do and didn't snore. 

I don't know how I can do this. I haven't had a decent night's sleep in 3 days, and I need to work a lot as well, would prefer to be awake for that.

There's no debating that personalities, temperaments and behaviors of men (and women) range very widely. There are no two men who are the same, however, there are basic interests and behaviors that men exhibit that are universal. I am going to explain a couple of things that I have experienced and researched about men and serious relationships. This is mostly to help women in long term serious relationships put some things into perspective. 

 Men love looking at women. ALL women they find attractive (and even some that they don't). 
-You may (or may not) come into problems in your relationship where you realize that your boyfriend/fiance/husband may occasionally comment on other girls, obsess over pictures of other girls, have hidden pornography, etc. Now, I have realized that allot of women are in denial about this subject.  

YES. Your man, yes yours, loves to see other women naked. He loves to check out attractive females. He loves their bodies, he liked to look at them ALLOT. Now I know there are men out there (due to their upbringing, religion, etc) where this is not too common for them. However, men are BIOLOGICALLY programmed to seek out females, even if they are in a serious relationship. (Note that ""serious monogamous relationships"" were not always the main deal with humanity). It doesn't make him love you less, it doesn't make him ""love"" other women.  

Your man will masturbate to porn (with, or without your knowledge) and not known to many women, they have the urge to masturbate frequently. To be honest, it really isn't their fault. That pretty little hormone (testosterone) is almost completely to blame.  
Basically what I'm trying to say is, if you're not open about this with your man and willing to recognize and accept that your man checks out, masturbates to, fantasized about, thinks about and has urges for other women (pretty much on a regular basis), you're going to be really miserable. You're going to find porn on his computer, you're going to notice him ""checking out"" other women. You will never get an honest answer to ""Is she pretty?"" or ""Do you find that hot?"" because honestly, yes.. she is pretty. Yes, that is hot. Yes, her cleavage showing turns me on. Your sister, and mom, and best friend and pretty attractive and they may (or may not) have appeared randomly in my thoughts while I masturbate vigorously to a girl masturbating on a porn site before you get home.  

They do not have much control over these urges, and neither do you. Some men have these urges and behaviors more than others, but it is pretty universal. You have to accept it in order to remain confident, worry free, and able to stay in a long term relationship.  
You may experience this in your relationship and feel terrible. You may wonder ""why?"" allot, you may think you're not enough, you may become extremely insecure due to this. DON'T.  Making your men angry, confused, shameful and embarrassed about it won't make it stop (forever, at least). It is something that must be accepted in order for relationships to happily work out.  

There are many arguments for why this is. Such as hormones, evolution, past experiences, etc. No matter the explanation, the main thing is that you realize that its not YOU. If your man is in love and wants to stay with you, and you love him just as much, by god please try to look past his porn fetishes and urges to masturbate when not around you. He has the right (as well as you) to masturbate, fantasize, and have private time to explore and fulfill sexual urges. (I'm not condoning cheating, however, for that is a whole other subject.) 
 
So, females,  allot of you have this problem and you don't know how to feel about it. I hope this helped you in some way, it is up to you to change your perspective. Choose to be more open and accepting, or choose to be insecure and miserable...

A little background in my situation:
Me, 21 year old virgin, introvert computer/electronics geek, experiencing my  first, serious relationship.
She, 20 years old girl, gone through a shit-storm of problems(at the age of three, survived a car crash, lost her father, had nose and thyroid operation).

We first met four years ago, as she made the first step. I still remember those times, like it was yesterday. She was wearing tight blue jeans, salad green jacket, hair spurting like not giving a fuck.
And then, it all went haywire. My roommate confessed, that he was having sex with her, but all that he could hear, was talk, about me.
Then, about a month later, my younger brother died in a motorcycle accident, few months earlier, grandmother also passed away. She was the only one, that still cared about me, dampened my suicidal tendency. Since then, meeting with her ""under four eyes"" was impossible - she was always together with some other girl.
One and a half year later, I confessed, of being in love with her. She replied that she wasn't ready for serious relationship.
Fast forward to nova-days. We still exchange with SMS, or have a chat over Skype. She's saying that I was the only guy, that just was together with her, without trying to get in her panties. Now, we're studying at different universities, 200 kilometres apart(that's about 120 miles, for Imperialists) with shitty-ass traffic.
Yesterday, in the new year's eve, I congratulated on her birthday (poor girl, her birthday is on 31-st december), she replied that she wanted to meet up. Still, have to hear any suggestion on day, or month from her.

So, fellow redditors, is there any advice, that you could spare me, share your experience, or anything? Continue this relationship,  or to live on in life?
P.S. I beg forgiveness for any spelling, or grammar mistake, as English isn't my first language.

We decided to purchase a book to help us see if real premarital counseling (with a therapist or counselor) would be needed.

My fiance and I are both non-Christian and would prefer to see advice and counseling based on a less traditional approach.

Using the mayoclinic website (http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/premarital-counseling/MY00951/DSECTION=why-its-done) - we would prefer to find a book that covers topics such as these:

    Finances

Also I don't like to put pressure on relationship ""time"", it's not like I'm looking for the one to die with; I believe that a relationship lasts as long as it is functional and if that is a few months, years, or even longer, then that's what it is.

However, patience is the part of the assembly line I somehow missed out on in the process of my making and its getting the best of me. I'm getting tired, and want more and more to drop it and keep looking. I'm the type that feels frustrated whenever I don't have direction in my life and I'm feeling more and more frustrated with this. 

So I guess my question is this, (aside from the title) for those of you out there with a fear of commitment, have you ever developed romantic feelings for someone? If so, how did you cope with your fear and those feelings? What about the possibility of losing that person altogether? 

So reddit-ers, let it rain; impart your personal wisdom and I will consider it before making the choice.

I fell in love with my best friend. I've known him for the longest time and he's been there for me through A LOT. We started it off with just casual sex, and it was awesome for a while, but then I fell in love with him.  He said he felt the same way as well, so it was heaven for a while.

 But for some (reasonable) issues, he had to call it off. He said he couldn't keep me from finding someone else with whom I can actually see a future. I kicked and screamed for a while, but how do you force someone to keep seeing you right? So I gave in.

 I've been trying to be ""just friends"" with him ever since. He lives in another state, so it is a little easier. But with both of us losing our job recently, I feel like I'm back to square one. I have this constant NEED to talk to him, and I don't feel remotely attracted to ANYONE else except him. Its like I'm obsessed. 

The worst part about all this is that he actually puts up with me. He doesn't shove me away and tell me to fuck off. He says he still loves me! I know this sounds stupid and the answer is simple, ""MOVE ON"". But its hard to move on when I have nothing to do and shit load to worry about. (And may I add no money to go out and buy a drink either?)

 Its too much for me to take at this point in my life. Please give me some words of advice if you've been in this situation.

My boyfriend and I just moved in together after about six months of serious dating- he is 29 and I am 24 [f]. It's only been a couple weeks, but one morning after sex he told me he'd like it if I ""toyed with him"" regarding my sexual availability- he didn't say much more than that (I think it's one of those desires where communicating too clearly about it kind of kills the appeal- like telling someone exactly how you want to be dominated, you're kind of not really being dominated if someone's just carrying out the instructions you already gave them, if that makes sense). 

The only elaboration he provided was that he wants sex more the less available it seems, and that he doesn't want to feel like he can get it whenever he wants. Beyond that he really didn't want to spell it out, which I can understand. However, now I'm kind of stumped as to how to carry this out, given that we live together! 

Some background that might be important- before we moved in together, we didn't have sex very often due to extremely inconvenient living arrangements- we took all the opportunities we could get (and probably some we shouldn't have taken, ie friends' couches) but there simply weren't very many opportunities. So during that time sex really was generally unavailable, although it was always great when we did have it. 

Now, I'm pretty sure I know what not to do- I don't think he has any desire for me to tease him during sex- ie, no tying him up etc, he's never indicated any interest in that whatsoever. I think he means more of a general atmosphere of sex being this exciting thing that he can't take for granted because it might not be able to happen (like when we didn't live together). 

I'm really stumped though as to what concretely I can do (or rather, not do) to make this happen. I love sex, so the fact of the matter is that in actuality, I am down for sex just about whenever, and I also have no problem initiating sex early and often. I guess that's something I could stop doing, but is there any way to do it that would play more into this desire of his?

We live by ourselves, so things like dressing up (or down?) are options, also for what it's worth he finds me very attractive so I don't think that is a potential issue.

So, if you are a person who is turned on by the idea that having sex with your partner is something that isn't guaranteed, what scenarios especially get you going, or what long-term things would help play into it?

tl;dr: boyfriend doesn't want to feel like we can have sex whenever, but we live together so how do I make him feel like he's really getting LUCKY when we do get it on??

GF[20F] has no orgasm and complains about pain after sex, doesn't want to follow my [20M] advice.",10,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1duv67/sex_frequency_is_decreasing_quickly_gf20f_has_no/,"Many aspects of the relationship are amazing and I don't want to end the relationship, but I can't live without sex either. Please help us! 

**History**

I met her five years ago and after half a year our relationship started 'officially'. After six months we had sex for the first time (we were both virgins). The sex was amazing and it happened at least 200 times a year (my GF counted it). After something like a year, a condom broke and she had to use a morning-after pill. Shortly after that she started to use 'the pill'. 

I don't know when it started exactly but the amount of sex we had decreased. She complained about being tired and having headaches. She also spoke about pain after having sex. I wasn't that worried: she didn't look that upset and my penis is sensitive too after an orgasm. 

**This winter** 

My room is quite cold and she blamed that for the lack of sex. I noticed she was less wet. When temperatures starting rising, we had some great sex again but it isn't often: roughly two times a month. I bought lube, hoping that this would decrease the pain she still experienced. She did not want to try it. 

**Other solutions**

I suggested that trying a different birth-control pill might help her, but she doesn't want to try that; she thinks it's stressful to try a different pill (because she doesn't trust it). I asked her to visit a doctor, but she thinks that's too embarrassing. 

Then I asked her to start masturbating. She doesn't masturbate and has never had an orgasm. I think masturbating will help her understand her genitals and what she likes and that she might even learn how to have an orgasm. It seems less embarrassing than visiting a doctor. But she doesn't want to masturbate (she isn't religious, she just doesn't want to do it).

**More information**

* She doesn't want to talk about sex. She doesn't use the words 'penis, vagina, sex' etcetera. She also doesn't shave or trim her pubic hair. 
* AFAIK, she was not sexually abused and has never had a boyfriend before me. She has a very friendly family and an overprotective mother (but she isn't religious and doesn't oppose sex). 
* A lack of foreplay is not the problem. Pain after sex has always been a problem in recent years - regardless of how wet she was, how much foreplay we had or whether I ejaculate in her. 
* Sex is gradually becoming more 'standard'. In the past she often was on top and we did 'it' while standing, on chairs, on tables, in showers, etcetera. Now it only happens in bed, while she lays on her back on stomach, letting me do 'the work'. 
* I will update this list if I think of more relevant information

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend can't orgasm and experiences pain after sex (she says its on the 'outside', not the inside). She doesn't want to change to a different birth-control pill, visit the doctor, use lube or masturbate. The amount of sex we have decreased from over 200 times per year to twice a month.

I have been dating my SO for 2 years and about 8 months now and I want to spend more time with him. Currently, I see him for an average of 12 hours a week where about 90% of that time is in the same day. I don't believe I am being clingy, but I would like to see him more often than that something like dinner at my place/his every other night for an hour or 2 would suffice and make me feel more content. 

I had a talk with him last week about my desire to see him more and received positive feedback that we will have more time together in the near future. However, I am worried that it was perhaps an empty promise due to recent events: I wanted to have dinner with him on our monthiversary,  but he had to bail because his had to cook dinner for his family. I wanted to see him the night after instead since I would be in the area doing an unrelated errand, but he declined last minute because of family dinner again. 

I suppose I am kind of upset and unsure what I can do to properly express how important this is to me. To give some light background: I have graduated and have a part-time job and a lot of volunteer work. He is still in school, but only taking 2-3 classes with no job. Every time he has to cancel a date or delay our already few meeting dates its because of his family. 

While I understand that family is important, I think we've been dating long enough that my feelings should be taken into consideration. I believe he thinks his family will feel sad (or something like that) if he isn't there to make dinner with them every night and spend time with them. 

I can admit that there is no way I can think to phrase what I want from my boyfriend, because no matter how I say things it always comes down to ME or THEM. I don't want to have him torn apart of anything dramatic, but I think my desire to see him more doesn't need to tear him from his family.

I have no idea what I can do, because I don't want to break up. We have a lot of chemistry otherwise and we make each other very happy when we do get to see each other.

tl;dr

SO of 2 years and 8 months spends a lot of time doing family things and only hangs out with me about 1 day a week. How do I convince him that he can hang out with me and still have time for his family too?

We both live with our respective families, but he is always welcome to drop by my house without me waiting for permission from my parents.

I was out with a friend of mine in a club this week. I really like her and could imagine more with her, but I don't think that I'd have any chances (insecure/don't think I have the looks)... She was my driver but I gave her my car as hers was broken.  2 hours after getting to the club I hooked up with a pretty hot chick and after another hour she offered me to go to her place. So I told my friend that she should drive home on her own. She suddenly kind of freaked out, telling me that I can't do that. When I asked why, she responded that she can't drive my car home on her own since she was afraid to crash it or whatever (I have no idea why. Like a drunk dude next to her will do anything about that). She insisted badly on me driving home with her (ofc only home, nothing more).  After about 2 hours of drama she finally got me to go with her, abandoning my chance for delicious snoo-snoo. I really don't know why I went with her instead of banging the other chick, but I did (Yes, I'm beta as fuck).
 
We're both in our early 20s and we've known each other for 6 years now, but are only good friends for a few months now.

Now tell me, why the fuck did she say those bullshit things and threw a huge fit just so I'd drive home with her? It didn't really make sense and seemed exaggerated.

I've always been a guy who takes appearance seriously, so I work out and dress well and groom and what have you. When I dress up to go out, no one would guess that I'm a nerd when I go home.

But when I am home, I'm wearing a 300$ headset for gaming, two monitors, custom built PC, hours upon hours of games clocked in, consoles, what have you. I play D&amp;D. I love to read and write. I love learning and drowning in the endless stream of interesting TED talks. 
But it seems nerdy isn't good these days!

So, in particular to the women out there of all ages - though in their 20's is ideal, what's your take about the characteristic attributes that a nerdy man has and how attractive do you find them? I wonder how many women out there feel similarly to myself, where we go out and feel we look great, but back home we're nerds at heart! Are there more out there than I realize?

TL:DR -- How attractive are male nerds who are intelligent and dorky?

In the next few days we chat a little through facebook, exchange phone numbers, the usual stuff, and in this time most of the chat and text messages were causing some sexual tension which is a good thing. She lives near my University and last wednesday we go out with some of the people that were there in that friday, everything went smooth and had a good time. 
So by this time I knew a little more of her, no red flags, just some yellow ones, some body issues and she said that she was in a 8 year relationship and still goes out to dinner with her ex, I really don't care I know her for some days so wtv. 

But I really want to know her because she has a freshening personality, she's 30yo and is more adult than most girls that are arround me. So my texts and chat talk went a bit more serious and not so in order to create sexual tension, asking about what she like in life, what she did in that day, playing a bit with words, creating funny contexts, etc, in order to create a good harmony between the two of us. I'm not trying to be nice, just curious about a person's life.

This is were it went south, the text messages were less and less interesting and short so I decided to ask her if she wanted to meet for a cup of coffee after lunch because, you know, text messages are not  how you know people. Not only she delayed the answer for like 4 hours for no apparent reason but said that she had two 12h shift in two days and needed to rest in the time between, ok I respect it's work, there are many more days no problem.

Today i go up to facebook and see pictures of her with a couple of those new friends, they went out (no problem here) in the time that she said she was going to have the shift...
I really don't know what to think here, I noticed that after I got a bit serious the interest of her went down, but this is a little bit too much, right ?

I'm starting to feel like the whole ""you always want what you can't have"" saying is true. I have been with my bf (m 23) for 1 year and a couple of months and everything is great for the most part. Little things kind of get to me however. This past week for example we haven't really spoken over the phone. I call him, he calls me back hours later, I'm busy. Or I call and text he responds hours later. This happens from time to time when we're busy with classes and work which is normal, but I know for sure this past week he hasn't been busy. Also, we have only been seeing each other on weekends because I broke my foot and schedule conflict and it seems like I'm always wanting to see him.

 Before, he was always communicating etc. Also, sex is great but I don't know if my wanting it 24/7 affects his wanting of me. The illusion of having to work for it is no longer there. I was always really shy at first so he basically had to work really hard to strip me down, now I just want to have sex all time, whereas he seems to not so quickly or easily.

I find out that I am to be the 'bad friend' if i pursue any sort of contact with this person and essentially retaliate with 'so be it i feel a connection with her.'(which I don't think I have felt for anyone in years). Then suddenly, 2 weeks later, friend C is trying to pull his moves on her while his friend tries to keep me out of their conversation.

Friend C has sex with a different girl almost every weekend. He came out of a reasonably long relationship where he was hurt; and now takes it out on all girls he meets by sweet talking them with stories of his travels of europe. He then takes them home, does the deed and comes to tell graphic stories to myself and other friends while avoiding any future personal contact with them.

Anyway, we both have work off tomorrow. It wasn't planned, I generally have every other Thursday off, by chance my day off happened to be tomorrow. 


**What I plan on doing:** 


Have her come over to my house, surprising her with flowers and chocolate (the initial cost of these items isn't much... roughly $20-$30). After hanging out for a bit, I have already told her if the weather permits we would be going to Ithaca, NY for the afternoon. There, (if the weather allows) we would hike a few trails, check out the commons/other places she/I haven't been to before. Then I was thinking about having a late lunch or early dinner? I haven't decided on the place yet, she likes all types of food (she actually works in catering/cooks/manages a restaurant.) She hasn't tried Thai food, which they have a few restaurants up there, should I take her to something new, or go with a ""square""/vanilla restaurant. (Ithaca has is diverse with the styles of food made there, I pretty much find most popular styles up there.) 


I think it's a nice little trip where we can make a few memories, take some pictures together on the hike, and share a nice meal. Afterwards, we'll go back to my place for some alone time. 


**TL;DR** - planning small day trip for Valentine's day. The usual will happen, dinner, walking around, and a hike if the weather permits. 


**Side-note:** we have had some what of a running joke for a while. 


**Backstory**, I had her over and went to the bulk candy store... bought a whole bunch of candies, in the mix was a single **Fireball** (I don't like them; I wanted to see if she did. Turns out she doesn't.) So since finding out about it, we have been playing a ""game"" of tag with the same **Fireball** for quite a while... I left it in her bed one time, for my birthday she wrapped it in a box, and most recently I hid it in her slipper... now looking back on my last move, I should have kept it and given it to her tomorrow.

I returned home (2.5 hrs away) while she worked on her Masters at our university. We talk and text daily and visit about every 2-3 weeks.

While we are very different people in terms of how we view life and handle problems, we have had a very solid and mature relationship. However, having depression is a strain on each of us and on our relationship. She has been tremendously supportive throughout of my illness as she has had significant experience with mental illness in her friendships. We both feel it is important in a relationship for both partners to be centered on who they are and not be dependent on the relationship, and while I am significantly better off than I was when I was diagnosed (7 months ago), I do struggle frequently.

It is important to be able to bring happiness to a relationship, but it is frequently difficult for me to do so (I, like everyone, have some issues with my family and have been stuck at home with them while I unsuccessfully job-hunt). I will often have days where I do little other than job search and go to the gym. Not leaving the house puts me in a very bad place emotionally.

Our fights frequently center around the fact that I can get stuck in rumination and unhappiness, which is a strain on my SO and the relationship. While we have been able to improve each time (I try to find new things to do other than job hunt i.e. going to the gym, additional training, spending more time with friends, volunteering and shadowing), I fear that eventually the strain will be too much and we will reach a tipping point where she feels she can no longer remain in the relationship.

Any advice on how I can handle my mental illness and not have it impact my relationship too severely?

1357497841.0,7,self.relationship_tips,162kng,I am [16M] and I am afraid that I am too clingy and paranoid. ,8,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/162kng/i_am_16m_and_i_am_afraid_that_i_am_too_clingy_and/,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend[15F] for a bit over a month now. This is my first relationship, as I've always been a bit of an introvert and I didn't really start making friends until high school started. I would ask my friends for help, but one of the things she made very clear when our relationship started was that she wanted no one to know about it.

This has been a source of conflict between us in the past, where I want the relationship to be open and she wants it to remain secret. Partially, I want the relationship to be open because I am proud of it, and I know that might be wrong, but it's true. Partially it is because I am scared and paranoid that she might be going out with someone else behind my back or avoiding me or doing other things to hurt me and I have no idea if she is or isn't doing those things, and if our relationship was out in the open, it would be much more difficult for her to do those things. **Am I being paranoid?**

However, I do trust her a great deal. Beyond being my girlfriend, she is probably also my best friend and the person who knows me the best. The problem is she not only considers one of her other friends her best friend, she also confides hardly anything to me. I trust her unconditionally with pretty much every aspect of my life that she wants to know, but she says that trust is not given, but earned: I hardly know anything about her. For example, I know she loves poetry and art, but she has yet to read me any of her poetry while she attends poetry club every Friday and shows a whole group of people her work each week. I know everybody moves at their own pace, but I desperately want to learn more about her. **Is this being pushy? Should I force myself to try and calm down about her to keep the relationship alive?**

This leads to my third point. Because our relationship is secret, the only real chance I get to really express my emotions to her is through chatting on facebook. So I am always looking for an opportunity to talk to her. I can't stop thinking about her. Every waking(and some sleeping) moment, at least part of my brain is thinking about her or the next time we are going to talk or the previous time we talked. She is like an addiction to me, but I don't know if she is as caring about me. She has told me that she usually just doesn't do relationships, so I think that my          over-zealousness might be pushing her away. She has stated before that she is worried that the relationship might be unbalanced as she thinks I am putting more into it than she is(I told her not to worry about it, because I didn't want her to worry about it), and I am beginning to think she might be right. **Am I just being clingy? In summary, is there anything more you guys need to know from me to help me fix my problems? Are my behaviors just typical angsty teenager stuff?**

Like I said, I am new at this, so any help or advice at all would be of immense value.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_162kng,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/162kng/i_am_16m_and_i_am_afraid_that_i_am_too_clingy_and/,

[20F],7,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/15kt5d/sos_with_cars_whats_your_opinions_on_this_20f/,"So I recently broke up with a boyfriend of 2 years [20M] and people have been telling me to learn from the situation, so I'm thinking back on one of the arguments we used to have. We talked about this a few times, but never came to a consensus, so I'm wondering what you guys think.

He had a car and I didn't. He didn't enjoy driving, and would avoid it whenever possible (however, we would usually go out to eat on weekends, and he would drive. He'd also drive to the grocery store). My issue was that sometimes I would want him to drive me places and he would never (literally never) drive me anywhere he didn't also need to go, citing that it was his car so he shouldn't have to use it for other people. For example, he's a pickier eater than I am, and I usually was okay with the restaurants that he likes, but my favorite cuisine type (Asian) was off limits because the only Asian food he likes is fried rice. Needless to say, we always went to his favorite restaurants. 

Occasionally this would come up in an argument because I would really be craving Asian food (I hardly ever had it, since we ate out together so often), but he would use the ""I'm the one with the car"" argument. Which I find rational (I mean, it is his car, and he should be the one to decide what to do with it), but at the same time, I feel like in a relationship, sometimes you should do things for your SO solely to make them happy and not out of any benefit to yourself. This argument also came up if I had to go to the drugstore or buy school supplies, or wanted to go to the grocery store when he didn't need to, or something. I would never ask him to go clothes shopping with me, but I don't feel like a quick trip to officemax is a big deal. Also, I think if the situation were flipped, I would drive him to officemax (about 2 miles away, which is a really long walk for me) and wait the 10 minutes for him to pick up things, even if I didn't want anything from officemax. 

I should mention that he didn't let people drive his car, so it wasn't an option for me to just borrow it and drive myself, or drive the two of us since he doesn't like driving very much. I also don't think it was about gas money, because I offered to pay for gas a few times.

Was I being unreasonable in wanting him to drive me places as a favor, when he did not benefit?

Who knows. I want to ask him to coffee, since it is a less formal setting, and tell him: 
""If it is not obvious, I have a crush on you. I get the feeling you are into me, too. But I fear that when I have a crush on guys I have a tendancy to misplace my goals, future, and life I want for myself.

I worry when I say this he will either be like, woah, I am not into you and that I make an ass of myself. But the reason this is so important to me is that, I have had this happen with a professor before and we acted on those emotions and it did not end well at all.

After a couple weeks, his texts started to become more and more distant, and even though I kept trying to talk to him like an idiot, he, at times, would flat out not respond for a day. This wouldn’t be such a big deal, if it weren’t for the fact that I could see he read my text and knew that he was attached at he hip to his phone. During this time, he did manage to shoot me a text stating “I just don’t want us to stop seeing eachother.”
After a week of practically being ignored for no apparent reason, I confronted him, and said I was getting mixed signals, and said that I liked him, but needed to know where I stood with him, to which he replied, “I’m sorry for that. We should talk.” (we never did, oops.) But right after he said that, he suddenly quit ignoring me!...for a whole day. One more weekend of being ignored, he shoots me a text, and this goes down:

I know I *like* younger girls more. I'm just curious if this in and of itself makes me creepy? I think some of the relationships were skewed in the sense of power but it was a dynamic I liked. All of the relationships were consensual and legal. 

My current relationship has been going strong for 5 months and we are happy together. My girlfriend is 17 years younger than me though. One of the threads I saw the OP was being blasted for a 13 year age difference. So I am a little curious to what others think of me. I can answer any questions and I'm just looking for some honest opinions.

Keep in mind that I'm in college.

I would be talking to them, they would suddenly suggest meeting somewhere at a specific time and/or giving me their number. She would essentially make the first move before I do, even though I want to make the first move. I would agree and when the time comes, she doesn't follow through, as if she suddenly changed her mind or forgot. There would be no communication so neither of us are at the location. 

For example, I was talking to a girl (neither of us exchanged numbers) and she suggested that I meet her at the gym at ____ time. come the next day, no communication, and I see her again and I say ""oh yeah we didn't go to the gym"". I suggest a different time, she says something like ""that's a little early, how about ____"" and I agree, come the next day and nothing happens.

Understandably I'm terribly sorry about it... but... I honestly don't remember him saying anything about it at all.

I've come to the depressing conclusion that I'm a bull in a china store when it comes to being sensitive.

I asked me to give him space for a bit and we plan to sit down and talk  some time next week. 

I want to be able to actually have some sort of idea of what i need to do to help myself not be so.. selfish? unaware of the feelings of others? I've known him for 11 years and even if we are not dating I want to maintain the close friendship we've had for far longer than we'd been dating. 


I always tell my partners that me being oblivious is one of my major flaws. 

He was always skittish about talking about feelings and I'd like to be able to be on speaking terms with him without stomping all over his emotions.

(Moved from r/relationships),8,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/wcmdi/dont_ever_give_up_moved_from_rrelationships/,"Reddit, if it is one thing I have learned. It is if there is someone who means more than physical vanity or life for that matter, don't ever give up. 

When I was a foolish, clumsy, sixteen year old boy, I had experienced two things; my first Relay for Life fundraiser, and being literally sucker punched by cupid's arrow. I was making my way across the football field, when I heard some other teens laughing while kicking a soccer back and forth. But then it happened. That cliche moment when time slows to nothingness, and that cheesy saxophone plays as your eyes morph into two hearts of desire. She stood there, athletic wear on, long, golden hair, and with a confidence around her that just magnified the longing for her. I wanted her, I needed her.

I didn't get her. Weeks went by and my friend came over one night. Being her friend, I asked him who he was texting. When he replied with her name, I got a severe case of snooping. Being a early to bed, early to rise kinda guy, he dozed off and I took full advantage of the security-less phone. I looked through the texts, envious of her flirtatious attitude she delivered through the texts. Although I cannot recall how I received her number, I believe I might taken it that night.

Days go by, and after a brief confidence talk with myself, I decide to achieve acknowledgement from this lass through Facebook messaging. I remember typing this paragraph about how she and I were not familiar with each other, but I thought she was the most beautiful creature I have ever had the pleasure to lay eyes on. Stop. I held the backspace button as long as my sigh of discontent carried. ""Hey"", I SO cleverly wrote. The conversation went no where. As it would. For months. Months of my incapability to shut up and grow a pair. 

Junior year. I had to. I just had to confess. Seeing her beauty made me more and more resentful I had not yet confided in her my desires. We had built up little more than a casual, once a week talking relationship, so when I told her she said she was grateful that I thought that way, but nothing more than that. I mentioned other things to her too that she thought were cute and would occasionally harass me for originally saying. This went on for an excruciating amount of time, us both gaining and losing boyfriends and girlfriends through the sleepless nights of high school. After a while, she never wrote me, and made it seem like I was interfering with other people's talk if I wrote her, so reluctantly, I maintained minimal contact, unless I was wrote first. Out of the blue, she would occasionally ask me if I still felt that way. I would get my hopes up. ""This is it, she's going to say something that will push us past 'friends'"". It never did. She would resume life, satisfied with the answered I provided. She did this for quite some time. Until February or March of this year. I had turned 18, and one night she asked me her rudimentary questions, playing it off as if she wanted to catch up on the life of someone who mattered so very little in the large scheme of hers. I told her a different answer. I explained how I've noticed that rudimentary pattern of her inquiries leading to the inevitable; me, once again, lonely. She was, needless to say, taken back. She claimed that those were not her intentions, and attempted to falsify all accusations regarding her ""toying with my heart"".  However, without this, I fear she would of never realized me standing there. Me, my physical form, and perhaps the damage done by the overlooking of someone who thought such a great deal of her. We started to talk, and although she was more open to how I felt, and was patient when I would say stupid things that only boys in love say. But as we got closer, so did our thoughts, our hearts, and eventually, our touch. I was making absolutely no sense one late night outside a 50's memorabilia ice cream shop. As I blabbed on, her hand laid on mine. Shocked, I looked down, then back up, into eyes. Eyes that... That...triggered every sensation in my body. Fear. Love. Remorse. Sin. Pleasure. Anxiety. Serenity. And though it lasted only a moment, it was all I ever wanted. I arrived home that night to the only thing I wanted more. A message that read ""I want to be more than friends."" I had to excuse my heart, as it decided to take a victory lap around the Daytona 500 (I can't believe I just made a NASCAR joke, -10 karma). 

One week after that? She invited me over after my Senior prom. We didn't have sex. We didn't party like teenagers around us. This girl, who was a woman in her gown tonight, opened the door to her house, in her yoga pants and an old tee shirt. I had never seen her look any more beautiful. She brought me upstairs to watch Tv and eat Ben and Jerry's (Thus introducing me to Phish food) and after looking at me with those eyes of absolute captivation. Simply kissed me once. We both smiled and knew what that meant to me. She is such a wonderful girl. Although it has been such a very short time together, we have hit it off in so many ways that neither of us have previously felt in other relationships. We satisfied in the fact that we can be what we are with each other. Goofy. I'll crack jokes that aren't funny and she'll laugh to make me feel good, and she'll sing the soundtrack of CATS! horribly! (on purpose), I love every word of it. She, and her absolute absurdities, completely complete me.

My only regret? Not standing up earlier. Not telling her what she meant to me. Although I do not resent the time lost, but rather I am ecstatic for the time we have now. So, my fellow Redditors.  Take the risk. It feels like you're jumping ship, you're abandoning your principles and free falling. But push through. Fight for what you love. Who you love. Don't. Ever. Give up.

To give some back ground info we go to college together but live about 150 miles from each other in the summer. However, we would be able to see each other for a few days every week or two. Her father also passed away about 6 months before we starting dating. She called me tonight and said she is always happy when around me but unhappy when she is not with me. Thus she wants to find out to be happy on our own so she can contribute 100% in our relationship. She also claims that she doesn't want to drag me down with her if she is unhappy and that she can't use me as a crutch all the time.

Anyways, she said she wants a break but didn't specify the length, just approximately for the summer since we won't be in the same city. (about 150 miles away) How should I approach this? Should I break it off completely? Be friends with her and get back together in a few months? Should I just take this time to experience other things? I'm not quite sure what to do but I don't want to lose her for good. She is easily the best girlfriend I've ever had and an amazing person.

Important to note that she thought that I was such a good boyfriend that I could distract her for about a year from her loss of her dad. Only recently has she realized that she is only happy when she is with me and hates the feeling she has when she is alone. Almost like I have done my best to fill a void in her life but she realizes she has to fill it with her own emotions and not lean on me all the time.

tl:dr GF wants a break to find her happiness without using me as a crutch, wat do? Has anyone ever had any success with a break and then getting back together?

I won't go into details on how we came to that subject, but she ended up saying something along the lines of ""You know, some men enjoy that kind of stuff."" and I, being one of those men, said just ""Yeah.... I know...."" She got the hint and was appalled. She always gets this way whenever we discuss things we find attractive, and I always get the feeling that I'm being judged. Like, I'm not allowed to fantasize about anything that doesn't solely involved her (large breasts, lesbians, etc.) or she feels like she's not good enough.

I don't want to lie to her about this stuff and just say ""Oh, no, that's gross, porn is nasty etc."" but at the same time I feel that she'll just think I'm a pervert. She doesn't even want me to masturbate.

Our relationship is rather complicated at the moment anyways (sounds so... high school, but it's true). For reference, we're college-age.

And let me just clarify that my girlfriend despises all porn. She says it gives men unrealistic expectations (as in, sets the bar too high). I've tried to argue that watching something on a computer and actually seeing/doing it in real life are completely incomparable, but she's not having any of that.

We never dated, but we were crazy about each other. She was there for me after a nasty break-up like no one else. We talked for hours on end and spent every possible second together. The problem was that I was a couple years older than her and her jock brother threatened me time and time again and said that if we started dating he would come to my house (its a small town, where everybody knows where everybody lives).

My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over three months. We've had some bumps along the way, but I'm really happy with her and really feel I'm in love with her. What's really cool is we're both spending the summer in the town we go to college in instead of going home. I'm really excited to spend the summer with her!

Anyways, I've had to be out of town for a few weeks after the semester finished up. Now, this would be such a huge issue except that most of her close friends have to be out of town at the same time I do. Her friends that are still around are very busy so she hasn't been able to spend time with them. She's told me she's felt very alone and it's made her very depressed.

1337137236.0,8,self.relationship_tips,tpcj4,She's a keeper.,13,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/tpcj4/shes_a_keeper/,"Background information first; I had been in a 2 year relationship with my first girlfriend in high school. I was a 15 year old freshman, pretty overweight (I weighed 197 lbs, and was only 5""4') and severely self conscious. I am now 17 years old and we are no longer together. She (we'll call her ""Al"") was the only person that whole year (this was in May, at the end of the year) to actually give me a chance. She was the sweetest girl I had ever met, loved me for who I was, and was incredibly honest, loyal, and faithful. She was in the same grade as me but at the time was only 14. She's 16 now.

Now, I had many ""girlfriends"",  but do to my image I never got out of the infamous friend-zone. I was like a very truthful best friend and no one gave me the chance to put myself in action and show them that I am not like those other guys. I don't lie, cheat, get jealous or angry, and am very understanding. 

Al was the first girl to ever give me that chance and I was the first to show her my truer side. We instantly fell in love and had a great summer and sophomore year together. But, things were starting to fall apart.

She was the catalyst for my weight loss and I ended up shedding 35lbs and grew to about 5""8' and became the happiest guy in the world until I started noticing I wasn't feeling the same way I used to feel about Al. I didn't really enjoy hanging out with her or doing the habitual routines or even engaging in our favorite activity, cuddling. I felt detached and an overall sadness when I was around her. I took more pleasure being alone and soaking in the limelight of my new image. I was beginning to finally get noticed by other women and that made me feel so good, but at the same time so awful that I could even think about things like that when I have a girlfriend who is still clearly in-love with me. 

A year went by like this where I would constantly sacrifice my happiness just to suffice hers. A year where we broke up and got back together 3 times, all out of pity for her, and a year where I was so unhappy. I thought I was doing her justice by being with her but now that we have broken up for good, I realized I had just been a parasite slowly sucking the life out of her. I still feel terrible because she loved me even though I had changed completely in the relationship. I was no longer the person she used to know and she STILL loved me. 

I decided enough was enough and she deserved someone WAY better than me and we moved on. Now that I see her happy again I feel complete. I have given my apologies and made clear to her the reason for the break up and everything and she of course understood. This was January of this year and upon moving on I finally had the option to be myself again and rediscover who I truly wish to be. 

Well, my answer came through at work. We just hired a new waitress (we'll call her Whitney) and she started about a month ago. I remember right when I first saw her. She walked in, and the first thing I noticed was these big, beautiful, blue green eyes. Her hair was blond and in a ponytail and she was wearing her work uniform, but to me she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I had to talk to her. I had to get her number. No, I needed to. But my words failed me. For the first time, they utterly ran like a scared puppy and refused to show themselves. 

It went like this for about a week, a week full of eye contact and smiles, before the ice was broken. Her friend who got her the job came up to me and introduced herself along with Whitney and I did the same. From that moment on, we hit it off like no other. I ended up getting her number and started talking to her and getting to know her better. 

She is an 18 year old senior at a high school around 30 minutes away from me and just got out of a bad relationship. We decided to meet up, have a little date, and realized how perfect we were for each other. We shared everything in common (except for food, she's a picky girl) and immediately set up another time together. 

That time together was today, where we watched Teen Witch and cuddled. Nothing has ever been so amazing, Reddit. It was absolutely perfect, me holding her in my arms and stroking her hair. I have never felt this way about anyone, including Al, and something about Whitney makes me believe she could be the one. I know I'm young and naive and we all think this at sometime when we are 17 years old, but I honestly believe this. 

I'm laying in bed as I write this and missing her so much. Thank you for listening to my story everyone and thank you for allowing me to tell you how I am now the happiest man alive.

* She's 3 years younger than me.
* *First time we got together*: it was just under a year when I got cold feet, wanted to see other people, had my own personal issues needing working out, and I also needed space from her - I broke up with her, she was very upset.
* *Second time we got together*: After a year of not really talking, we got back together. The basis was that I desired her to be in my life but we are incapable of being ""just friends"". We acknowledged our strong connection and, based on that, we decided to relationship up a second time. Our bond was as strong as ever. My affection for her only deepened around this time and I took to telling her I loved her often. I was happy with it all, content. After about six months she broke up with me abruptly. I was pretty calm about it as it happened. The way I saw it, I agreed to her decision out of respect. The way she saw it, I didn't ""fight"" for Us enough. I was probably so accepting of it because I had hurt her feelings* and felt huge guilt, in addition to being the initiator of the first breakup. So, in her words, ""something was just off."" So we split up for the second time. 
* *More current stuff*: We began talking again sometime later and we were comforted by eachother. We went our separate ways again after we both said we were happy being single and weren't ""waiting for the time to be right for us to work"". I told her what we had was extremely special and worked, but I was open to one day meeting someone else. 

Recently, I got drunk with a friend and started divulging how much I think about her, how so many things remind me of her, how she is the most special person I know (totally true), how I am very open about saying I still love her to this day. He advised I talk to her. So I did. 

We went on a date last night and after the initial catch-up talk we were just as intimate as ever. She is more beautiful than ever, and just as wonderful a person as always. It was only one date out of the blue, and it wasn't a promise of any future relationship or anything... I gave her a kiss goodnight on the cheek and the rest of the night I felt high - butterflies - it was electric to be around her... This is the person with whom I am at my most vulnerable, the person I respect more than any other in my life...

Or was it? As jubilant as I felt, I also was thinking: *am I in love with her, now more than ever, OR am I just lonely as fuck and latching onto what was my most successful, compatible relationship?* I should also say that I have a fear of commitment that manifests itself in fantasies of exotic travel, womanizing and sexual conquest and such, but I simultaneously know deep inside that all of that is actually rubbish and will leave me alone and fucked up... If you made it this far, thanks, and I'd be happy to divulge more info if asked. :)))

 * When I say ""hurt her feelings"" I want to specify. We never cheated on each other, never lied. I said hurtful things to her, things people who are in a relationship aren't supposed to say. I also played weird mindgames, and was aloof and then wondered why she didn't come to comfort me in my vulnerable state. I was fucked up in the head and I in turn fucked her up a little. It was emotional bullying, no doubt about it. Me feeling *intense* guilt about these instances was common when they would be brought up. Even *now* when I recall the shitty things I said and did, I cringe inwardly. I worked through these issues I had since then now. I can say I don't think these issues would plague a good relationship if I were to find myself in one now.

The problem is that I am still very attracted to her and I think she is to me. So over the weekend my wife was away and we went out for a few drinks. I spoke to her during the evening telling that I really was attracted to her and so on. we talked a bit but nothing too serious. I then invited her back to my house and she came. When we got back to my place I tried to get it on with her but she rebuffed me. She ended up staying on the couch.

Now, why would she have come back to my house when she knew I wanted to get it on with her? She could just as easily gone home. I don't really understand her behaviour. Any ideas?

Ages 20, both of us. 

So my relationship has turned into a long distance military relationship and it has been two months since he left for Air Force basic. I just realized I still have no idea what kind of world I have gotten myself into. Yes, he will be on a base, somewhere, somehow for sometime. Doubtful that i will ever be able to fully understand and experience that (at least for a long while), because I can not attend his BMT graduation ceremonies. 

Like to point out that I understand what it takes to be in a long distance relationship. I however, do not fully understand what it takes to be in a military relationship. That is my main keywords for advice.

Not even sure where I could start with questions on how to prepare myself. Just overall advice would be appreciated. He is Security Fores and will be at tech school for the next three months. Hurray, talking to him on skype and getting to know how he is doing. But is that how our relationship will be most of the time? Him exhausted because of a job without alot of time for me? On second thought, don't answer that. i will deal with that one when it comes. 

Just would like some good ground covering advice or stories about how to live in a military, long distance relationship. What are some good tools you have found? By tools that can be anything from the way you treat your relationship to make the distance easier...all the way to programs and fun online stuff to do together. 

I plan on getting to know my boyfriend alot better over these next few months while he's at tech school. But I also just want a more solid relationship. Any tools for that?

 So: Any tools for how to make this relationship easier to work and live in? BF in Security forces tech school and in Air Force. Clueless girlfriend who doesn't quite know what this will be like.

Once or twice a week I would say. The subject of relationships came up and she said that she was not interested in a relationship right now. Then last week, I was in my college town visiting some friends and she was in town for a concert. Well, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping in the same bed and kinda hooked up (She was sober, I was not). Now, I am in a predicament where I am starting to crush on her again. I can tell she is also crushing on me, not sure how bad though.

Never dated, never been asked out, never really wanted to date anyone. Never felt attracted to anyone. I was pretty cool with that. I never felt like I was missing out or anything; it's just who I am.


So I started graduate school last year and just absolutely fell for this guy in my program. Holy crap now I understand what all the buzz is about. I get the butterflies in my stomach and everything. I thought they were just a figure of speech. He is adorable and brilliant and I'm pretty sure this is what attraction feels like but I've never felt it before so I don't know.  We have a decent sort of friendship going on--we talk about video games a lot, and yeast genomics/other work stuff.


There's a lot of problems with this. First off, he has a girlfriend. Secondly, I have no idea how to even have a relationship with anyone. I've never done it. I'm not even very good at making/keeping friends. I obviously have no chance at this even if he didn't have a girlfriend. 

I have to work fairly closely with this guy, and this is not making it easy. I feel bad about even having a crush on him since he is involved with somebody else, but I really can't help it. How do people function when they feel like this??? How do you think about anything else? How do you get rid of or at least tamp down a crush?

We met online and had a long distance relationship for the first 2 years so actually being able to live together has been a great improvement to what we share.  

She has struggled with depression and anxiety since she was 16 years old and it has never been fully addressed or treated.  She was unable to go to high school because her best friend turned on her and created a lot of drama, so her mother pulled her out and home schooled her for one year, and then she finished out her senior year online.  After she graduated was when she moved in with me.

She is currently unemployed, and is suffering from depression and anxiety that pretty much keeps her from being able to live her life as a young adult should.  She stays inside almost all day, her activities outside of the house are based directly off of mine (going shopping, visiting friends or family, etc). I am the sole provider and I certainly do not rely on her or anyone else financially, but as someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past, I know that having a job offers structure to a person's day, and it gives you a sense of purpose.  I feel that she really needs this but her anxiety and depression are keeping her from pursuing anything of this sort.  

When she moved here originally, she was hired at a local grocery store and worked in the deli, but one of her male coworkers made inappropriate advances on her that still really bother her to this day (3 years later).  She worked at my job after the deli for a couple of weeks but they put her on a graveyard shift and she was unable to adjust to the schedule so she quit.  After that there were two other jobs that didn't pan out for one reason or another, and at this point she has been unemployed for about a year now.

I am constantly pressured by my family with questions as to why she is not working.  I use my own funds to care for her, to pay for trips to take her back home so that she can spend time with her family, to bring her back here, and she has been staying with me in my apartment with her tiny dog and my landlord's do not know about this.  The original plan was for us to work together and save our money so that we could eventually move out and into a place where we don't have to hide the dog or her.  I have told her that this can't be accomplished on my income alone.

I am scared of what is happening to us.  I love her so much but I do not know how to help her and my patience is and has been running thin.  I was always told to ""get over"" my anxiety and I always overcame it on my own, so I have a tendency to be very cold or misunderstanding towards her and I know that is the last thing that she needs.. It has been established that the best route is for her to get some therapy and possibly some medication.  We have started the daunting task of looking for help from the government (considering she is an independent without a job) but I am running out of other ideas to help and I can't help but feel like we are running out of time.  She tells me that she feels I am bullying her because there are times where she will show passion towards a tv show or a video game, and I tell her that I wish she could show that passion towards her life.  It comes out sounding mean and I certainly don't try, but I do believe this downward spiral has slowly turned me bitter or resentful and I really wish that it hasn't.  Tomorrow I plan to call my old counselor who offers couple's counseling to see if I can get in and how much the sessions would cost under my new insurance.  

My girlfriend has asked that instead of letting everything build up and taking my frustration and anger out on her, to just kindly remind her that she needs to be putting an effort towards getting government assistance.  I told her that I will do my best and that I need her to be showing me that she cares about this.   For a long time now I've felt alone in this battle (and I know that she has too, for other reasons), and when I look ahead 5 years I don't see what I want.  I want to have a happy future with her but she can't put forth the same effort as me as long as she is wallowing in her depression and anxiety.

They also do not like that in his FB pictures, he is tagged in more pictures with ""my"" friends (our mutual friends) than ""his"" friends. There was also the apparent suggestion that my BF is more serious about me than I am about him (lie). 

I just don't know what to do or say about it. I have been deeply upset about this all morning and don't know how to handle it. I like his family, and two days ago they were acting like they liked me. I just don't know what changed from those two instances. 

I'm so worried that his parents will change the way he feels about me. I also don't want to cause a rift between him and his parents. We are in a very serious relationship, having discussed marriage and kids as well as plans for graduate school/moving after graduating.

Recently I've been struggling with finding the most humane way of rejecting someone. I want to get better at it to avoid leading people on and make a difficult thing as painless as possible for everyone involved.

I feel really guilty about this because I know I have led some people on by trying to be ""too nice."" I don't want to be cold, but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings more than necessary, and understand that the longer things drag on the more damage it does. I really respect people who are brave enough to put themselves out there and want to show them that respect and maybe even gain some of theirs in the process.

So here are my questions:

* If I'm immediately not attracted to a person, should I even bother politely chatting for a bit, or is it just wasting both of our time? Is there a standard amount of time you're supposed to give someone?
* Does anyone have a go-to rejection line?
* What is the kindest way you've ever been rejected? The worst?

To keep things fair: My kindest- when they have just kind of disappeared/stopped texting. My worst- he invited me along on a date with his new girlfriend. (I didn't find out about her until the hostess escorted me to their table and I saw them holding hands. ***Ouch.***)

She's my first real girlfriend and my first sexual partner and when we do have sex, its amazing, but there in lies the problem... a while ago (about a year), her libido dropped tremendously and since then, we only have sex about once every month and a half (even longer for certain stints) and sometimes when I do get her in the  mood to have sex with me, I'll make her cum then when it comes to my turn, my little guy will just basically shut off and no longer want to work...  

I feel terrible because I, and I know this is wrong, I seem to badger her everyday about it (which I've recently cut down on as she says it makes her angry) and that makes me feel like a perv whenever she gets mad and turns me down and also because it makes me feel like she hates/doesn't want me. She says that me constantly asking on top of some certain behaviors of mine (apparently im very childish at points) is a huge turn off for her. She's also come out as telling me that apparently she has some sort of skin irritation down there that makes it itch and that this also contributes to her not desiring sex. I've told her that she should go to an OBGYN, but she is afraid of her parents finding out as they are very religious.

I didn't really talk to her or anything when we first met, but she still sent me a friend request on facebook after we met. About a week or so after she friended me, she instant messaged me out of nowhere. We talked for a little bit and she told me she thought I was cool and stuff like that. The next day though, she changed her relationship status to ""in a relationship"" with some other guy. I didn't really care that much at time though because I didn't really have feelings for her yet.

This is where things get interesting. She then messaged me on Facebook again and we ended up talking for a few hours. At the end of  the conversation she even gave me her number (without me asking) and told me to text her. So then we started texting pretty regularly, most of the time she would even be the one to text first. Sometimes we'd get kind of flirty too. We also started hanging out more often because her sister started going out with one of my friends. I eventually learned that her relationship that she says she's in on Facebook was kinda one-sided and that she wasn't really that much into him. Like, I don't even think they've kissed or anything yet.

Recently though, she hasn't really been texting me as much as she used to. Like she never really starts conversations much, but she still responds with stuff like ""heyyy"" whenever I text her and we normally talk for a little bit. The most recent times I've seen her in person she's been a little more flirty too. Like yesterday, we were hanging out at my friend/her sister's boyfriend's place and I was sitting on the floor while she was sitting on a chair next to me. She then got up out of the chair and lied down on the floor right in front me, kind of touching me too. But the whole time she was on her iPod Touch and not really talking to me, so I didn't know what to do.

I'm pretty sure she likes me, the problem however is that I've never had a girlfriend and don't know how to approach this without fucking things up. All the girls I've liked in the past and have tried pursuing have all ended up in failure due to her not liking me back. This the first time that a girl has liked me and I liked her back so I'd really like it if something happened between us. That's why I come here asking for advice. How often do I text her? How do I flirt back without being creepy and grabby? How do I show her that I'm interested too? Just pretty much how do I do everything I need to do to turn this mutual attraction into a relationship? 

I just feel so confused and frustrated because it feels like I should know what to do, but I don't. I simply don't know what to do.

* Intelligence/interest. While she is studying at a university and thus has reasonable intelligence I am smarter. Also she has not got that much interest in science. Sometimes I wan't to explain certain quantum mechanical principles or molecular phenomena, but she doesn't really want to learn to much about this. Also at the moment no problem, but i am not sure whether I should be able to share everything. **Should I be able to share complicated stories with my SO or is it not an issue on the long run, any experience on this?**

She is however an extremely caring and social person, which I am not.

In a sense we are counterparts, I am scientific and objective while she is a more religious emotional caring person. I just can't figure out whether this will end well or not.

A thought has been bouncing around in my head lately.  Sincerity is fairly important to me, at least partially because I have a sense that it is rare.  So I try to be sincere in my relationships.  I'm very concerned about appearing false.

So here's my question.  Suppose you really like someone, you like pretty much everything about them.  I think it's pretty conventional to assume that you should tell, or at the very least, be able to tell, the person why you like them, what it is about them that makes you attracted to them.  But, if you overdo it, if you start just listing every attribute they have, it may come off as insincere; you may be accused, whether vocally or implicitly, or the person may only think, that you are ""just saying nice things,"" that you don't mean them.  I don't think self-esteem issues are implied by having that reaction (although, if I am wrong about that, please tell me).  

So in light of all this, what do you think about mentioning a few things you *don't* like about the person, to show honesty, and that you're actually thinking about your answers and feelings?  Sort of a ""I know you well enough to know your flaws, and I still like/love you"" kinda thing.

At any rate, while this is just a recurring subargument, it's generally put to bed.  The other day it came roaring back to life in a big, bad way and really turned into a horrific fight.  It was probably the worst I've ever had in any relationship ever.  He said some things that were not even remotely abusive, but definitely hurtful and hit just the right spots.  It was a case of ""The one you love knows how to hurt you the most"".

We were very close to breaking up, but I decided I wanted to try and work through this and not give up.  He really is an amazing person and when I'm not busy with school our relationship is fantastic.  I understand why he gets frustrated when I'm in school, and I fully acknowledge that I'm asking a lot of him when I have to tell him I can't see him because I'm studying for several days (and occasionally weeks) at a time.  So we decided to stick it out, and make it better.

The problem is, he's so grateful for having another chance he's basically assuming the entire thing is over.  On the other hand, I'm still feeling the sting and I know deep down I'm still hurting.  When he tries to talk sweet it irritates me.  When he wants to cuddle or do anything intimate, I just don't want him to touch me.  The problem is, I don't know WHY it irritates me or why I can't find my way through it or what it would even take from him to make me stop feeling this way.  
I'm not an angry person by nature, and I'm not one to really hold grudges. 

TLDR: Fiance and I got into the worst fight we've ever had, he said hurtful things, and we almost broke up.  I decided to continue working at it, but am now somewhat resentful of him.   Anyone out there who can give me advice on how to get through and past this??

1. Make one of his favorite meals

2. Massage Session ;) 

3. Movie/Dinner night out

4. Go out to a nice bar/lounge

I am at a crossroads in my mind. I recently visited my home town after being away at college for some time and managed to see a girl from my old high school that i had feelings for but who always seemed to be in a relations ship when i was not and vice-versa. Now keep in mind she never ever knew i had these feelings for her. 
Well the first night i was in town she called me up and we went to a bar, had some drinks and wings and caught up. Afterwards we got back into her car and proceeded to kissing rather vigorously. On the way back to my house things got a little more physical and never finished. The next morning she calls me and tells me she wants to hang out. Which ultimately resulted in finishing last nights affairs.  
 Regardless, the next night i traveled back to my school and did some thinking the entire way back. I was thinking to myself that i really like this girl and i might want to try to take it a step further. 
Now the dilemma is that while i was out with her the first night we got on the topic of relationships and her ideology is she doesn't want to be in one, just the benefits of it ( without being to graphic). I think this is because she was in some very bad relationships and just wants to have a good time, and i have no way of knowing if i would be a different ""situation"" for her. Another problem is that my best friend has also hooked up with her (less intimately but hooked up none the less) and is probably looking to again. Now he had the same mind set as i did in high school but no longer has strong feelings like i do, yet the information of what i did may break our relationship.

Also, I had known him for longer than we were seeing each other), I wake up feeling miserable and guilt-ridden. We got along perfectly, made each other laugh all the time, and I couldn't think of one thing I didn't like about him except

he had remained extremely good friends with an ex-girlfriend (he dated her for four years) and her entire family (has been and would still consider going on their family vacations, attended her overnight birthday party, golfed with her father, close friends with her brothers, etc.). 

As a woman trying to date this man, this was extremely discouraging. She has been dating one of his best friends for a few years, so I never really had to worry about any funny business between them, but the closeness, like I said, was extremely discouraging. I mean, I thought I'd eventually have thoughts like: Why isn't it my family he's that close with? Why is he going on family vacations with her family when it should be mine? etc. 

so I said I couldn't handle it and he agreed we probably shouldn't spend time together anymore.

The saddest part for me is that I think he actually moved on (rather quickly) to someone who was also friends with his ex and friends with one of his female best friends. I never asked him to stop being friends with her, but I definitely made it clear that I felt some of his behaviors would cross the line if things got more serious between us (overnight at her birthday party, attending family vacations, etc.).

I just can't help but feel I lost the perfect man because of insecurity issues and now someone else will have the one I want more than anything. I have never wanted anyone so much: he's intelligent, gorgeous inside and out, funny, had only slept with two women in his entire life, modest, endearingly shy, etc. There was nothing not to like about this man. I just keep seeing him as ""the one who got away."" 

Some days I wish I would have just shut up and let the circumstances hurt me in silence so I could still be with him, but I honestly don't know how long I'd have felt OK.

Jesus...)

Both 27, in a committed relationship, living together, and both doing the medical school thing. We know we're going to get married some day, but timing is tricky due to the educational gauntlet.

We had started wearing these cheesy friendship bracelets during a camping trip. I bought them in a gas station as a dorky prank--make the boyfriend walk around with a matching, woven disgrace of nylon? Lame Level: Expert!

Well, after the giggling subsided, we realized that we had been wearing them for weeks. Even stranger, both of us were reluctant to take them off. Yes, embarrassingly, at some point we assigned meaning to these $2.00 purchases, originally intended for funsies.

As the professional world goes, he can't keep his dorky friendship bracelet on while wearing a suit and examining patients. But, he keeps it by the bed, nonetheless.

Recently (in an attempt to remain humble but provide enough information to the reader: we're a smokin' couple) he and I have received a surge of strangers hitting on us individually. I began to wear a silver toe-ring around my left finger as a deterrent. My other half said he would consider doing the same.

(Hang in there, know this is long...)

A while back, I found these KICK ASS titanium bands with wooden inlays. Unique pieces that completely match our personality. They can be worn as wedding bands, but they can also just be worn for the hell of it. So, I got to thinking... we needed to scrap the friendship bracelets....why not upgrade to friendship RINGS?

Obviously, their meaning would go beyond friendship. They'd be worn on our left hand to signify our taken status... but, more than that, I think we'd both like to have another, more legitimate, symbol of our connection. The obvious answer is: just fucking get married. But, we do NOT have the time or money for that. And we'd like to involve family and friends. So, it has to wait. Additionally, we have such a solid relationship, and we both realize that weddings are just a piece of paper... it's not going to enhance the already stellar.

He LOVES the rings. Thinks they're awesome (and he's not even a jewelry person). He mentioned it not being a bad idea to wear a left-handed ring as a deterrent. And when I brought up the subject of possible ""friendship rings"" tonight, he nodded and said, ""I feel like I don't wear enough jewelry...""

So, Reddit, my question is... are there any possible pros or cons to this idea that I am missing?? I think I might buy them in a couple of months!

Give me your opinion!!

TL,DR Boyfriend and I are scrapping friendship bracelets, we've talked about wearing left-handed rings separately. We cannot get married right now for school reasons. Is it a good idea to get ""friendship rings"" for symbolic purposes? Guys, how do you feel about it?

Here's a question to hopefully spark some discussion and advice.,6,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/wyjnn/college_is_upon_us_heres_a_question_to_hopefully/,"Basically, my girlfriend (20) is two grades above me (19), and we both live around Boston. We've been together for just over two years--we first got together in my sophomore year of high school (she was a senior) and there was a brief scare of breaking up when she was going into Smith college about three hours away in rural Mass., but we decided to stay together and have since then. The relationship has been at times rickety due to the age gap yet almost always immensely gratifying, as I think is natural for a serious long-term relationship to be.

Anyway, I'm entering my freshman year at Connecticut College this August, which is in New London, almost two hours away. My question stems from the fact that, in preparing for my freshman year, I read a lot of advice from people that had graduated, some of it pretty bitter, saying not to have a girlfriend going into college. They say that the quality and quantity of their friendships would have been much improved had they been single going in.

So, my question: why is this the case? I'm not considering giving up my girlfriend by any means, nor do I see myself using her as a crutch or devoting all of my free time to her--we're both fun but shy people and she's been in college for two years; she understands how hard it can be to make friends and is willing to give me that kind of space in the beginning. Have you been in a similar situation? How do you think being a shy guy in this kind of relationship would impact my ability to make and keep friends? Do you have any thoughts or advice on how to handle a relationship and balance it with a new social life?

We began to text and talk daily nearly all day just for the comfort of having that other person there, he comes to visit me whenever he can, yes it is a long distance thing, but he doesnt really live anywhere his job keeps him moving around a lot, we hang out at the house, go out and hang out and have sex. 

We essentially act like a couple we text all day, skype every night and even sleep on skype and if it stays connected we'll talk in the morning till one of us has to go to work. When he comes over it is all cuddles and sweet stuff and we have nicknames for each other and everything. 

Over the months I tell him if I'm starting to feel any different than I did about him before this way it's not a surprise. When this thing between us started I didn't have much interest in him at all but the more I've gotten to know him the more I've grown to like him, he used to ask me if I would think he would be worth the risk and I told him I don't know. So as time has gone on I've updated telling him hey I'm starting to like you a lot and so on and so forth he would say he likes me too. Last month I told him I really like him a lot and if it gets any worse I may find myself asking for a label from him, he seemed ok with it at the time, he didn't protest or warn that I shouldn't.

So now its this month and he went and hung out with one of his new friends that happens to be a girl and that didn't bother me at all when he came back I asked him if he had fun and he said yes and so I asked him if they had sex cause what we have/had wasn't set in stone, we said if either found something they wanted instead or wanted to sleep with instead we would let it go. We both agreed at the beginning that we wouldn't be comfortable with either party sleeping with someone else at the same time because you never know whats out there. His response was ""not yet"" and I got that feeling of jealousy which I didn't think I would feel over him. So I guess I liked him more than I even let myself realize, so a few days go by and I think about it and decide I'm going to ask.

So I ask him for a label.....and he says no. Which is fine I can take the no, but I know I can't continue on the exact way we have been carrying on because that is what got me to where I am now. 

So then we end up talking about what goes on between us for a few days cause we talk about it in between our usual conversations, I feel slightly burnt but its nothing i cant deal with. So in one conversation he pretty much says he needs to have me as his best friend, he needs to be able to talk me but other than that its just sex. Then he goes to, idc i was just sleeping with you. To the final, I'm scared of losing you but I'm more scared of getting into something with you then having it fizzle out and not have it in me to end it with you. 

I keep flipflopping between just staying the course with him and if things just continue and get better then to bring it up again or if I should just completely forget about him, I really dont want to lose him as a friend but I'm afraid it may come to that at least temporarily. I mean I have never immediately been so comfortable with someone before, we met and we just clicked immediately we can talk about anything really except his feelings he gets uncomfortable with that, he tries but ends up talking in circles. Even the sex is awesome and its cause its the same thing we can talk about it and communicate what each person wants and each person is willing to do or at least try.

So reddit, what do you think and what should I do?

Does it seem like hes actually really into me and is afraid of that or that I'm essentially fuck buddy zoned.

1340598788.0,5,self.relationship_tips,vk2fz,Male (26) Needs some advice about a commitment-phobic GF (25). ,7,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/vk2fz/male_26_needs_some_advice_about_a/,"Hello Reddit, I apologize for the wall of text, but I will try to be succinct while giving enough details for good advice. 

I have been dating this girl for about 7 months now. To say that the relationship has had its share of issues so far would be kind of an understatement. The girl I'm dating has some intimacy/relationship issues stemming from past relationships and childhood issues that have manifested themselves in a few different ways, the most obvious being intimacy and commitment phobias. 

Pretty shortly after we started dating, she had to have some surgery and went through what I thought was a bought of depression. She already had an admittedly low sex drive, but this basically killed it. This, tied to some performance anxiety on my part, has lead us to having a basically sexless relationship. We have talked about it and were working on trying to address it by going back to a ""dating stage"" where we were going to try to work our way back up to sex by holding hands, kissing, making out, etc.  

I thought this was going well, though our summer has actually been a lot busier than we thought (we have been going on lots of trips together to see our respective families, spending a lot of time together). We had fooled around some, which I thought was a good sign, but then I kind of got hit out of left field earlier this week. 

She was preparing to go on a vacation trip with her family during which she had already established she was leaving her phone off so she could have no distractions. After hanging out one evening, she revealed to me that she had been having doubts about our relationship and was going to use this time on the trip to try to sort them out. She said that has been feeling smothered/like a caged bird lately and also feels like she is constantly disappointing me and that I am settling for her. She also said that with the stress of school and work that the idea of a committed relationship freaks her out. There was a lot said (including that she doesn't know if she is attracted to me sexually or if its her own issues that have just killed her drive). 

She reiterated several times that she ""really likes"" me and that she is doesn't want to lose me (as a friend or otherwise). She has had a string of bad relationships and a rough childhood, which I believe caused a lot of the aforementioned phobias about commitment and relationships, and she fears that her questioning of the relationship is due to that.

We had a pretty lengthy conversation that ended amicably enough, I told her not to rush her decision and she told me that she loved me (we hugged and kissed when I left). The next day she apologized for ""freaking out on me"" and told me that she values the time we spend together and what we have. She also told me that she is both lucky and grateful to have me in her life.  She then told me that she had been given some good advice that day from a friend that basically said ""you need to focus on yourself, but don't push someone away who's willing to be there for you while you work on your own issues"". She told me that she is going to stop dwelling on what she perceives as relationship issues and start living ""day to day"". 

The question is coming soon, I promise. 

The 7 month relationship has not gone as smoothly as I would hope so far. She has difficulty letting her guard down and distances herself in an effort to prevent herself from getting hurt. When we started dating, some of her friends told her ""don't fuck it up this time"" and she even had another friend (who is a piece of shit) tell her that she was not relationship material. With this and her past relationships in mind, she has basically told me that she goes into relationships now with the idea that they will fail. Her greatest fear is being alone, but the barriers and defense mechanisms she puts up basically guarantee this. To top it off, my friends and family see her issues and all basically tell me I should break up with her. (saying that I could find someone without the issues and it would be easier for me). 

I am a very patient person and I'm told that I'm way too nice. I am willing to try to stick it out with her to help her see that she is actually worth something. I care about her very much, and I can see the good in her, I think she has just been put through the wringer so much that she doesn't know how to react to someone treating her well (it freaks her out).  What would you do reddit? Has anyone dated someone like this before? Are there any girls who maybe have had similar experiences as her who could maybe give insight on how she is feeling?  I know it would be easier to just ""drop her and move on"" since we've only been dating for 7 months, but I do care about her and want to help her get over some of these issues.  Sorry for the novel, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He makes me feel like no one else ever has. However, I was never into the whole ""casual"" dating scene. If I am in a relationship with someone, there needs to be long-term potential.

**A little about him:** He is 21, also one more year of school. However during the school year he is 300 miles away and I only get to see him on breaks. This was hard to deal with at times but we made it through last year just fine. I don't know much about his previous relationships or how serious they were.

**A little about us:** We met at work last summer and have been dating since August 23rd. So we have been together for about 10 months. I know that isn't very long. We have never discussed the future, not really anyway. He has told me he doesn't plan on going anywhere, and one night he said something like ""Know what I love about you? I know you'll be around for a long, long time"".

**And finally, my question:** Obviously it's too soon to bring up the future. It hasn't even been a year yet. I probably won't bring it up until we are both close to graduating college.

1338398678.0,5,self.relationship_tips,ucd2y,Elaborating Some of My Momma's Advice...Part 2.,5,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/ucd2y/elaborating_some_of_my_mommas_advicepart_2/,"*This is part two of my momma's advice that I was asked to post on here by a fellow redditor.*

Ok so in my last note it was about the advice that my Momma gave me. There were a few things that I wanted to go into much further detail and share some of my experience on how I achieved it.

1. **FIRST LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF AND BE HAPPY BY YOURSELF:** Yes sure this is easier said than done for some people. I'm not saying that anyone is perfect, nor am I myself. But if you feel comfortable in your own skin, then someone else is going to notice. If you want to change something about yourself then do something about it and change it. If it's something you can't change then either come to terms with it or just flow with it. In the end this will make you happy. Which brings me to how to be happy by yourself. I know that it's a cold and cruel world out there. I have faced some mean people and some of them were very dear and close to me. But the majority of those people are no longer my friends or people I associate with. I am a ""giver"" and not a ""taker"". I know this and so does a lot of people. Some of those people have taken advantage of my kindness and have used me to their benefit. For me it's emotionally draining and takes a lot out of me. With some people they just took so much of me, that at night I was exhausted and didn't want to deal with anything, not even my kids sometimes. I know that sounds bad, but it's the truth. So in order for me to be happy I had to stop being friends or associate with them. Yeah sure it hurt at first to have to throw a friendship away. But in the long run I became happy because I no longer felt like I was being used. I now surround myself with positive people and understand that people can have a bad day (or two). But if they have nothing but negativity coming from their mouth and/or actions, I dump them in a heart beat. As my momma always says: Life is too short to be unhappy!

3. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON, YOU'LL KNOW:** Yeah I thought that this was all BS too. But it's not. My momma has always told me that once you meet that person you're supposed to be with for the rest of you're life you'll just know. For her she told me that she knew that my dad was the one for her by the second week that they were dating. She said she could picture herself with him for the rest of her life. Things that normally would bother her in a man, didn't bother her at all. For example, she made it a point to not date a guy that wanted more kids or had more than 2 kids of his own. Yeah well neither of them wanted kids, but my dad had 6 kids already from previous marriages. That completely didn't matter to her. She has also told me that she could be her complete self around him and didn't have to ""try"" to impress him. Everything just came naturally and just went with a flow. Since I have met my BF, I know what she means. Within two weeks of meeting him I knew that I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. I can picture myself with him for the rest of my life, going on trips with him and my kids, getting married to him and becoming a family one day. Before I met him I said that I would never get married, even if I met the right man. Yeah well that's thrown out the window, cause I do want to marry him. I also said that I would never have any more children, but if he wants to have one, I will have one. Also, I have always had this ""pull/instinct"" inside of me that has told me to keep searching and looking for the right person. I don't know how to explain it that well, but every guy I dated I just knew he wasn't the right guy and to keep looking. Well that feeling is completely gone since I met my BF. He is the one for me and I am the one for him.

4. **NEVER SETTLE:** There's a song by Surgarland called, Settlin'. If you haven't heard the song I suggest going on youtube and doing so. That song kept reminding me to listen to the ""pull/instinct"" inside of me and not to just settle cause I was lonely or sad. Because I too didn't want to settle for anything less than everything. I know all to well the feelings of being lonely, sad and scared. But that didn't keep from continuing my search for my ideal man. I knew what I wanted in a man and wanted of a man. But I just never found it and by the third month I moved on. I always said it was cause I got bored with the guy I was dating (which in a lot of cases I did), but it was cause I knew he wasn't everything that I wanted. Settling for someone just to fill those voids just leads to more loneliness and unhappiness. So I kept moving on and made a mental list of what I wanted in/of a man every time I did. I just added on to my list with every relationship, because something was always lacking. My list consisted of 10 things that I wanted in/of a man: 1. I want to be able to be myself around him, completely. I don't want to hold nothing back, because then it wouldn't be the true me he falls in love with. 2. I want him to accept and treat my children as if they were his own (and vice versa if he had kids). 3. Be able to talk to each other about anything, even the most stupidest and silliest things. Communication is very important to me. 4. My family and friends all have to like him and get along with him. 5. Not controlling in any way. I have dated plenty of men who think that they have to control me to keep me close. Yes I am a flirt, but that doesn't mean I'm going to cheat or anything of the sort. I have been cheated on and know the feeling and wouldn't want anyone else to feel that pain. 6. Honesty. Even when it's criticism. The truth hurts sometimes, but it will help me better myself. 7. Loyalty. I'm too old for playing games and having my heart played with. If you feel that you want to cheat please break up with me and do that to someone else. I don't go for that crap. 8. Trustworthy. I want to be able to tell him all of my secrets and not have to worry about him telling someone else about them. 9. Be independent but knows when to ask for help. I too have hard time asking for help, but I know that when I do need help I do ask. 10. I want a man who gives as much as he takes from the relationship. I'm a giver like I said before and sometimes I don't take as much from the other person in the relationship. So I want someone who does give and not just takes. I end up feeling used and abused in the end and I don't want to feel like that when I'm dating someone.

I hope that this advice helps you or someone you know. It's taken me along time to follow this advice myself. But once I did, my life just seemed to fall in place. But I think that the best advice my momma gave me is: Life is too short to be unhappy!

1337667064.0,6,self.relationship_tips,tyvle,"I want to know my SO of 3YRs is it for me, but can't judge the relationship well enough.  Successful relationship havers please send me your advice!",8,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/tyvle/i_want_to_know_my_so_of_3yrs_is_it_for_me_but/,"24F from USA, he is 32. I love my SO very much and want more than anything for him to be the man I can spend the rest of my life with until a happy old age. (Obviously my divorced-parent pessimism probably plays a role in why I have many doubts - maybe my bar of a good relationship is unrealistic?  Maybe I have it but have no one to compare notes with)


I can't tell if I am happy or unhappy in the relationship:


1) I live in a foreign country (Peru, Chile, Argentina) which is where my SO is from and has his family and friends.  I am NOT happy here.  I thought I could love all cultures but I do not like the society here (big city so I know its different in the rest of the country).  I am tired of the ""every man for himself"" mentality. I am tired of the ""my boys are god"" mentality that mothers put on their children. I AM friends with locals and I do enjoy them very much so its not an individual thing, but a culture-for-the-city-I-live-in thing. I am experienced living in other countries but I am not happy here (which disappoints my formerly naive self who loved Anthropology).


2) Given the above, how can I isolate my experience with my SO to tell if we could be happy together in a different country?  Could it be that just the environment is taxing as it would be on any couple?  We both work 10 hours in an over-populated city. He has a stressful job.  How much can I really expect from him for this? I have no energy when I get home. 


3) I actually AM happy with my job and out of work activities, but am not AS happy at home.  Maybe it is that by the time we both see each other we are exhausted, or maybe it is us. I am a much happier smilier person than he is though - he is a pretty serious person.


4) I am clashing with his family.  The don't talk about things that bother them and I don't obey the mom as much as she would like.  I am VERY direct (though I keep pretty much everything to myself around them which takes a lot of will-power).  I tried to explain my interpretation of some events to the mom once after she flipped out (I paid her back for something and thanked her, which was me ""throwing away all the love they have given me"") and was very polite and logical and understanding that it is different in her country.  She did not get any of it and responded in hysterical emotions so I have not tried that again. 


5) My SO is very committed and we adopted a dog together which he believes is like having a child together.  I do believe he thinks I am the one for the rest of his life. He does try very hard to improve and does learn things very well, especially considering what most men in his culture get away with.  It is quite impressive how much he helps out around the house and with our family chores considering the culture.  Given this, I would say he is A+. 


6) As his family does not communicate very well he is learning. He has gotten much better and saying when he is upset and wants something from me.  He does not communicate on a much deeper level though.  This could be a man thing but almost all of my male friends and I can talk about religions, politics, travels, growth etc for hours and the two of us do not really get into those subjects.  Maybe this goes away though when you spend so much time with someone?


7) He is a very serious person.  At work I am always the happy smiley one.  In fact, I have mostly always been known for being happy and smiling.  I don't think I am that person around him.  I would like to be and he would probably be happier if I was.  


8) We would make excellent parents together but neither of us is really interested in having children. I always avoiding being the ""Mom"" or ""Baby"" in the house game as a kid.  I was usually the dog (also almost always had only male friends). 


With the above (there is so much more but that is enough for now) I would like to know, am I doubting the relationship for a good reason or am I just being over-analytical since we reached 3 years? Am I wishing for a ""knowing"" feeling that maybe is just fantasy and I just wouldn't know any better?  Should I just say ""this is an amazing man"" and devote myself to the relationship even more?


If this person loves you and is a great great catch in his culture, and is dedicated to you and willing to learn and work on things, should you stay and try to improve the areas?  


I feel like we have already improved a lot but at some point maybe you just need to say its never enough.  Where is this point?


Basically, I feel our entire environment makes things so hard to judge the relationship between just the two of us.  Like I said, we make an excellent team for so many activities, but maybe just being a good team is not enough, or maybe its temporary and later we can be better.

We've had a really rough year. We were engaged and living together until last fall when he got publicly blackout drunk and was hugely offensive and verbally abusive. It was the icing on the cake of a few months of a failing relationship. I moved out but we kept dating. Tried counseling but the therapist wanted to only see him due to his substance abuse problems before seeing the two of us together. This was about nine months ago. After the incident in question, boyfriend tells me he is an alcoholic and starts going to AA meetings and is stone cold sober, tells me he'll never drink again. Sometimes it seems like we're mending our relationship, sometimes it seems like we're just wallowing in a shitty relationship. Meanwhile, boyfriend stops seeing therapist, stops going to AA meetings. I notice it but he seems like he is in a solid place so I don't mention it (mistake). 

We decided to go our separate ways in March after we decided we didn't feel like we were going anywhere. We got back together a few weeks later (of course). Since then, we've been doing great and things have been the best they've been in a long time. He is, after all, my best friend and my love. 

He recently returned from an overseas trip with family. I picked him up at the airport and felt like something was off. I smelled a rat. I wanted him to tell me himself what was going on. He did not. Eventually, I asked him what it was like being overseas as a nondrinker. He reveals, actually, ""I decided to have a few drinks while I was over there. Just one or two at a time. It was no big deal. I just have to control myself."" Then he gets up and leaves the room to cook food for us. I am fucking floored. After the public drunken episode (which was really really bad, by the way), he blamed his behavior on his alcoholism. Said he was going to control it. Now, I feel like by his drinking again, and being so nonchalant about it, he is essentially taking back all his excuses and reasons for his bad behavior. Then, when I confront him about how messed up this is and how he broke my trust, he reveals that he started drinking again back in March when we broke up for a stint. He's sorry, didn't know how to tell me, didn't think it would be this big of a deal. 

So - I am torn between asking him to go to couple's therapy with me or to just break it off here and now. People with alcoholic SOs, do you have any advice for me?

* He has no interest in meeting my friends. Most of my friends are big on drinking and partying and my bf dislike those activities, and I understand he does not want to meet them because of that. But I would like my best friend (F) and him to hang out, the three of us together. He says he does not understand why would anyone would want to meet him (?).

He is young and has not introduced a girlfriend to his parents before, but (correct me if I'm wrong), after almost a year I think we could go on a trip to meet his family. Just to know them and let them know I am treating their son right. As of now, he has told me we will discuss the trip later in the year.

1333953048.0,6,self.relationship_tips,s0ggi,Extremely hot girl and one of my closest friends. I like her but am confused on what to do?,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/s0ggi/extremely_hot_girl_and_one_of_my_closest_friends/,"I'm 21 (male, obviously), she's 22. We're both in college, we're both astrophysics majors. Cherry on top: We're both brown people (South-Asia represent!) in a dominantly white college-town. We were both born and raised in the States, though.

Now, she's not your typical nerdy/shy/awkward geeky girl that you'd expect from a physics major. She is incredibly hot and very sexy. She goes out to the bars almost every night, parties hardcore throughout the week and is the most extroverted/social person I know. Also very nice, thoughtful, polite and cheerful.

We've been in the same classes for about four semesters now. When I met her, she had a boyfriend. They had been dating for 3+ years and it seemed very serious, so I stayed out of it (we became really close during this time). All of a sudden (4 months ago), he breaks up with her because of some stupid reason. It takes her a month to get over him. After that, she reverts to her previous extreme partying self. Now, almost every other ""guy"" friend of hers is REALLY trying to go after her, but she wants to stay single for a while and is too nice to say no, so she lets them take her out for dates, etc. Also does random hookup sessions and sleepovers with them, but doesn't let it go anywhere else.

Now here's the real dilemma: I think I like her (it's impossible for anyone not to), and I'm pretty sure she knows this, even if she doesn't say it. She's very smart, caring, nice and is a joy to be around. But she also has very high expectations from a relationship. She is also extremely needy, very sensitive, very narcissistic and self-absorbed (she knows how hot she is and flaunts it like there's no tomorrow), CANNOT STOP TALKING and can have ridiculous mood swings from one minute to the next. Then there's me, a semi-introvert who has never been in a relationship and is looking for something that would actually last with someone that I cared a lot about.

The problem? I see it ending very quickly with her if we were to date. We're polar opposites in personality, do completely different things ""for fun"" and have a drastically different perspective on life. I really enjoy studying with her and hanging out with her as it is right now. Does it really need to change? All my friends seem to think so. Today one of them said ""After you guys graduate, you'll miss her a LOT. By then, she'll be happily dating some other dude."" This upsets me quite a bit.

We've even talked about dating or being in a relationship. Hell, she seemed to be up for it. She literally asked me to ask her to be my girlfriend and I didn't. I honestly can't see the point in being in a relationship with her if I don't see it going anywhere and if it's just going to make things very awkward between us after we break up (because you know, we'll still be in the same classes and see each other a lot, like it or not).

To accelerate the gravity of the situation, every single one of my friends is in a relationship. I live in a house with six other guys, all of them have their girlfriends over 24x7. It's no denying that there's heavy indirect pressure coming in from there.

So yeah, I'm not madly obsessed over her. I like her. I just like the way things are right now. So why the hell am I confused over this? Where exactly can I go from here? We're super tight and super close right now, what would you recommend I do?

If you’re planning on using the GPIO, you’re already a hardware hacker with a good idea of how to mount them, so we’re not concerned about this.

We're both juniors in college, and just started ""officially"" dating about 3 mos. ago, after 4 mos. of casual dating.  We've said the ""L"" word, and we've never fought, and I really enjoy spending time with him, but I feel like we see each other too much.  

I'm never sick of him or anything, but I see him basically every day, and I stay at his place almost every night (he has a single room, I don't).  We're usually only apart when we have class or other obligations, and when we're with friends.  Sometimes we even hang out with the other's friends together.

I'm usually the one that calls him, and I just ask him how his day was, and he's usually the one to ask if I want to go over at night, and I almost always say yes, since my roommates go to sleep early and my SO and I stay up pretty late.  Some weekends I don't even go back to my apartment, and he'll come and go and I'll still be there, napping or using the computer.

I've never had a problem with clinginess before, and I'm really easy going when he says he's going to do something; I try to never invite myself along, I always wait for him to ask me over or invite me to hang out with his friends.

Some days if I don't see him, he'll text or something and ask if I want to do something (like go to a movie on a Monday night), and he'll say it's because he hasn't seen me in a while....a while being 24 hours.  And he says he gets bored sitting in his room by himself, and enjoys my company.

Hi Reddit,

I need to apologise (I'm not even sure if it will work because I f*ed up big time but I'll ask what ye think?

My bf needs his space for now so I'm going to give it to him but I want to make a really meaningful apology. I've sourced a cool gift box (in his favorite color) for starters. I'm going to write a long apology letter (and say all the things that need to be said).
I was going to buy him a voucher for a shop he hasn't been to yet (because he hasn't visited the city yet) but one that he's really looking forward to going to (to give him something to look forward to instead of having to feel hurt) and (if i can afford it - i'll find the money from somwhere hopefully - I'm going to buy 2 tickets for that city). I was also going to donate money to a charity close to his heart in his name because a gift like that is more meaningful than most i think and put all these things in the box. I don't want to do this if it's cheezy and meaningless. The letter will be sincere but I want to make this apology special. What do you think Reddit? If it's a bad idea please say so and if you've any alternatives please say so too.
I want this apology to show how I feel, to show how much I love him, so it's really important it's not cheezy.

I'm not sure if the relationship will survive this so if he decides to move on I want the apology to be sincere anyway. I don't want it to be a bribe.

The thesis is essentially that due to our inherited system of male dominance, male children learn to disconnect from their sensitivities, preventing them from having real loving relationships, while female children learn to suppress their own wants and needs in favor of accommodating for others. The consequences of this dynamic in the relationships that ensue are discussed with the author offering solutions. The book is written in a style that clearly lays out points and demonstrates them using composited examples from his (the author's) family therapy practice and personal life.

I felt like this book explained alot about prior relationships of my own and has given me an enthusiasm to enter into another, while preparing me to negotiate its intricacies.

3. Toastmasters: I went back to my old hobby. Thanks to a fellow Redditor, he introduced me to a club at my old college.

So I have 3 current circles. No work circle, I work at the family business and everyone else are employees :P I'm currently looking into a spiritual community and some other people I'm meeting at the gym. How about you guys?

So there's the saying that the only thing a guy would want to change about his girl would be her last name... but is there really any truth to that?

We're both 18f. Recently, my girlfriend of 9 months and I have been getting into disagreements; I guess our honeymoon phase is coming to an end. So today we had a minor fight. We were talking on MSN; I was playing a game while she was showering and was in the middle of a boss fight when she came back. To avoid her thinking that I was ignoring her or anything, I quickly tabbed to her window and typed ""busy"". After I was done (less than 10 minutes since she came back) I quickly logged off the game and told her exactly what happened, but she was irritated and sad because I essentially chose her over a video game.

Then she said things like ""it's okay, go play your games"" to attempt to make up for it but that felt more like a guilt trip to me (""go play your games while I'm miserable over here""), so I too got slightly irritated because I thought it was unreasonable since I'd already said sorry and explained why I didn't talk to her. Anyways, I told her exactly how I felt and she told me she knew she was wrong for being mad but she couldn't stop the feeling of irritation and sadness for that split second. 

Basically: My girlfriend is sorta clingy, for the lack of a better word. I don't mind it now, but I'm scared in the long run it might suffocate me. I don't feel that being clingy is a particularly good trait, but it *is* a trait of my girlfriend and I don't want her to be repressing her feelings and not telling me if they're there. How can I work this out?

**tl;dr If you don't sit well with a part of your SO, is it right to make them change?** I know it seems intuitive that it should be a ""duh! Relationships are about compromise"" but a part of me can't help but feel guilty about wanting to change a part of my girlfriend :(",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,t3_h2l5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/h2l5x/they_say_if_you_love_someone_you_wouldnt_want_to/,

It doesn't help that I basically live on frat row in a major college town.  The kind of girls I find at social areas around here really are not the kind I ever want to speak to. So while at the Penny Arcade Expo this weekend, I figured there would be the highest concentration of girls I'd like to meet.

So anyway, as I was walking around PAX, I did see quite a few attractive girls, but I was loaded with all these questions.  Are they single? Did they come with a boyfriend?  Do most girls who come to conventions come with a boyfriend?  Do attractive single girls even attend conventions...maybe with some of their friends?  Do they get approached often by guys at conventions?  Would I just be one in a line of awkward dudes trying the same thing?

1) I only ever had one gf, in high school, never had sex with her.

2) I'm not a virgin, but sexual encounters are few and far between.

3) I've been single for the last 6.5 years.

4) Women seem to regard me as a creep, even though I would never do anything untoward.

Basically, my issue is this: I've been single and looking so long, with so little success, that I've basically gotten used to being single. I have, by necessity, learned to get along without sex or female companionship.

You ever want something you can't seem to have so badly that you just get fed up and don't really want it anymore? That's how I'm feeling about women right now. I've had it up to the ears with being rejected and ignored.

I feel as though, after this long, I'm just used to being alone. On top of this, what sex I have had has been generally unsatisfying, I imagine since the caliber of woman who I am able to attract is rather bottom-of-the-barrel.

It sucks sometimes, especially on days like Valentine's Day recently, when you can't get fresh air without being blasted in the face by images of happy couples... but it seems to me that relationships might just be all hype.
Most of the time, all you hear is people lamenting the fact that their partner is a psycho who wants to drain away their youth and virility. 

Stories abound of psychos who make their partners' lives hell on wheels. These stories are much more common than stories of happy relationships.

I know that even in healthy relationships, arguments are normal from time to time, but it seems like modern girls all expect to be whisked off to a castle in the sky, and guys who can't manage that mythical feat are doomed to be pecked to death.

So, now that you see my state of mind, I ask you these two questions:

1) Where is the flaw in my thinking? I can't help but think there's got to be one, but I can't seem to find it. Is all this grief worth the hassle?

2) Why should I trying to break down this wall, if all that's on the other side is potentially a bunch of trouble?

TL;DR: I'm so frustrated by my inability to get a gf; and so concerned that if I find one, she'll just be a psycho; that I'm wondering if looking for a gf is even worth the hassle.

However, when our college exams came around about a month and a half ago we had to make sure that we were focused on that for a few weeks and just had to make do with seeing each other a little less. We both understood that it had to be done, but it was still tough not being together as much as we'd have liked.

After exams, I went abroad for a week with some friends from uni and when I came back we only saw each other for a day as I had to go home for a while(we live quite far away outside of the college year). She ended up telling me that she was pissed off that we couldn't see each other, after so long apart, for longer than a day. I listened to her and completely agreed that it was unfortunate, but explained that I'd be moving back to the city my college is in within 2 weeks to look for work, as we had previously discussed. She was more than happy about the fact that I'd be returning but still upset for the moment. 

We've always been the couple who talk constantly to each other,and we've never been stuck for conversation,but during the exams all we had to talk about(due to study-induced lack of social lives) was how great the summer would be and finishing exams. Since I moved back to my college city, I've been looking for work(unsuccessfully so far) and meeting up with her regularly like we used to. She has a job and works different shifts during the week,so we have to work seeing each other around that. I just find that we have less to talk about since the study period for exams. We ring each other and sometimes just have silences where before we weren't able to get a word in, and if we're texting, they're often short and consist of ""what you up to?"" 

I'm not worried about a breakup at the minute,since we're the same together as we always were,but I'm worried that if the lack of conversation when we're apart spreads to our time together a breakup could happen. Is there anything I could do to spice up the conversation? Perhaps don't text or call as much?

My gut says there's something wrong, which usually means there is. The first half of our relationship we lived in the same city &amp; lived together (though not officially...we were in college &amp; had our own separate places, but we stayed the night together every night), but the past 2 years, we've been doing a long distance relationship on and off. She was in Europe &amp; I've been between South America &amp; Canada. We're both currently in Canada for the summer, though a thousand km apart.

She just hasn't been texting me back as quickly, blows off Skype sessions, etc. I treat her very well, tell her how beautiful she is &amp; how much I love her, how much she means to me..you know. She hasn't said ""I love you"" back for the past few days. We're supposed to move to Europe together in a few months &amp; I've told my whole family, work, friends, etc. that I'd be going there.

I've asked if everything is alright, only to get no response. The last time I saw her, she was a bit off, too. Just not the same girl who used to love me to death.

I'm already going through the stages of grief, preparing for losing her, but I honestly don't want to. Then again, if she does bring up a breakup, I don't want to be the one broken up with and would rather say it was mutual, just to save face, even though it's the last thing I want.

    O.K. So I met a girl at a music festival because she was friends with my friends. We kissed and fell asleep together that Sunday night, then went seperate ways the next morning. She friend requests me on fb, I get her number, and we start from there. 

  I see her that tues for a no big deal, drink wine and hang out sort of ""date"". We had a pretty good time and got to know each other a bit better. She told me some pretty personal things, showing a bit of trust. We were both kind of drunk and she goes downstairs where her roommates are, without really saying anything. Leaves me upstairs for 20 mins while I am kind of just day dreaming, and it is pretty late
 (3 am). 

 I come downstairs and she is passed out on top of her guy friends who is my mutual friend. She had said she'd known him for 10 yrs and she is a bit out of his league. This was a total drunk type of passed out too bc they both look uncomfortable.

Dude starts to try to get into her pants, lazily and from an awkward angle.  I get irritated and leave, really creeped out by the whole thing. *She just told me some deep secret, how can she have WANTED the night to end up like that...*  So I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.


I decided that it would kind of piss me off to hang out with her again and have the same sort of thing happen. This is where I went wrong, most likely. I wanted at least like a little ground to stand on if I am going to ask guys to back off. Like a we are seeing each other when we are together in person but otherwise its all fair game type thing, is what I was aiming for.

 She of course didn't know that because she is terrible at communication via phone, so I never get into any good conversations at all with her.  I do not let the txts build up, but I do txt her on Wednesday  to see if she wants to chill that week, planning on having a ""So what do you want/ what are you looking for in a relationship"" type of convo.

She was weird about answering, getting distant already. So it was wednesday, thursday i txt her bx my dads band was playing downtown, so I would be in the area, I ask her if I can take her out sat. night. I knew I was going to be hungry, so I booked a table at one of my fav. restaurants and she was pretty responsive to me asking her out.

I just wanted a sat. night date, I didnt know this was like so suffocating for some people. I felt like this was a completely normal and adult thing to do. It was a 3 hr time commitment.


She flakes, but gracefully on sat. saying something sad happened. I dont push it, I let it go.

Now also you must understand that I am in the last summer of my Sr. yr as a chemical engineer. I am raging it every day and night. She has a full time job and is busy.

So she blew me off that sat, and then after some more friendly txting, she starts getting less receiving again. How hard is it to text back ""hey I am sooo busy, ill have to get back to you"" ???

I ask her if she is going to a bluegrass show we both see on tuesdays at a local pub near her. She is nice and responsive. 

  She gets a new job. Now I am already annoyed by how she cant txt me back in a reasonable manner, but not letting that show at all. I knew that she was going to have no time, and that seeing me only twice and then not making time to at least talk some, would lead to the dissipation of this romance. I made a move, I sent text along the lines of ""I want to see you again, I want to kiss you again, you are talented and it turns me on. I know you are going to be super busy but, if you don't make some time for me, we will never get to know each other.""  
 

I got a little freaked out that I freaked HER out so I followed up like 30 mins later, "" Damn, I am a big freak, freaking out the girl I like""  
for 2 reasons, to show I can laugh at my self and am not that serious of a guy, and to gauge her response. She said I was comming on to strongly. OK good communication. I still knew that it was going to shit though. This is summer, shit happens fast, and I want a summer squeeze. 

It wasnt working out for either of us I guess, despite lots in common and a strong attraction. I know I was a bit overbearing now but *call me crazy but I enjoy being friends with my lovers, and that aint going to happen unless she commits some time so I can commute 40 mins to see her* ...

flakes on the Tuesday, not her fault though, she had her first day on the new job.

She peters off into unresponsiveness. I am totally chill for about a week in my txts, and she txts me back a little bit, periodically for a week. I asked where her new job was, saying that if I was in the hood, I would stop by. Which I would be, for other reasons than her anyway, truthfully. 

Probably freaked her out more, poor little emotionally baggaged cutie. She invites me out for a night but only MAYBE bc she is not sure when she is getting off. More unresponsiveness to texts for days follows. After 2 days of nothing I just decide to throw it out there, pretty much giving up

 "" You sure you dont want to txt me something to keep this alive? If not I just want you to know I wont be awkward if you see me and I am thankful for the time we did share together. If you want to pick this up again at some time, I am willing to forget how it left off.""  

She finally answers and says I am comming on too strong and she has been THAT busy that she couldnt txt. Of course she had time to update her status on fb about how her headphones get all tangled up though. 

My last relationship started out with strong feelings and she returned them, it felt great. Just because I wanted to follow my emotions, I ended up looking like a stage 5 clinger. It is great to be sweet to someone and have them be sweet to you back. I learned that my effort radar needs finer tuning and after a bit of unresponsiveness I should do the same.  

We both were destroying those tiny stomach butterflys for each other simultaneously and both unaware. I might be able to salvage some broken wings and abdomens, a few antenna still. I am not txting her till she txts me this time.

He isn't happy with the way school/work/life is going for him and he is bottling it up inside and then taking it out on me and that's not fair, according to him that is.

In my head I go through the obvious scenarios that he is telling the truth, or he is lying to spare my feelings and he doesn't love me anymore, or he is lying and he wants to go fuck girls for 3 months. That last one is the only one that I don't think is plausible because we went out for a while and I know him; he isn't a fan of the random sex thing and he always thought it was weird that I was (before we were dating of course). So it's one of the first two.

So I am absolutely devastated. He contacts me maybe 2 or 3 times while he is overseas to see how I am. He tells me he is thinking about me and missing me. We had planned to maybe see each other once when he got back and I decided that was a terrible idea and told him no because if I was looking forward to seeing him I wouldn't get over him for 3 months.
He returned a few weeks ago. Turns out 4 months wasn't long enough for me anyway, but I decided to do my best to suck it up. I text him because I had a few of his things still in my house and I wanted to know when I could give them to him. We met last week and he said he missed me and asked about my family etc. I told him that it would really help me getting over him if he just told me that he doesn't need to sort anything out and we are just over and he doesn't love me. He told me this and then he cried and I left.

2 days ago he texts me. He needs to talk to me. I knew it was a bad idea but I gave in anyway and he came over last night. He goes on about how he was an idiot and he can't believe that any of the stuff he thought mattered even mattered. Apparently he was lying the other day and it really hurt him to lie and he wants to get back together. We discussed this for a bit and then he kissed me.

I am seeing him again on Sunday and all I want to do is get back together with him but I am worried about the same issues coming up again. My break up friend (a girl at work who broke up with her boyfriend at almost the exact same time which was convenient because we had a lot of chat sessions) says that he just left and he doesn't deserve it, but I don't really think it's about what he deserves it's about what will make me happy.

The question for you is, does anyone have experience of a relationship breaking off and then getting back together that hasn't ended in horrid re-breakup? I need advice please.

I took her virginity and we basically have been been living together in my dorm room since. She had slept over everyday for about two months. For two months I didn't really know what I wanted with her so I never asked her to be my girlfriend, however the exclusivity was implied and neither of us have touched anyone since.

The problem is that I just graduated. She has one more year at the college and I do not know what to do. I did not think I could be overcome with such emotion when she went back home, but now I realized I made a huge mistake not trying to talk to her about 'us' more before she left. The one serious conversation we had was the night before I graduated, both somewhat drunk, she cried and said she did not want to leave me, that she has abandonment issues, etc. I told her I would never leave her and will never break her heart. It's only been 4-5 days but its still hard, even though I make sure to text and message her everyday.

I haven't gone back home yet, but we both live in the same state. Problem is we live in complete opposite directions of each other, so it would take me about 3 hours to get where she is, but only 45 minutes to meet up in the city. So I do plan to take her out when I have the money and hopefully meet her parents. I have to go to Colorado after about a month and stay there for the rest of the summer unfortunately, so I'll missing her for two months.
My plan basically is to go about it head on. Take her out for a movie/dinner/something, go to the park, and talk about 'us'. About how I want to be with her and how I want her to be my girlfriend. She's never been in a relationship before so I'm not sure how to handle this. The question is if I'm moving to fast for someone who just graduated? I really like this girl and I feel like I'd missing a chance if I did not do this. 

Also, the college we go to is only about 3-4 hours away by bus, and I could easily visit and stay with her for a month or two there. It would not be clingy at all as I have plenty of friends there and know much of the college. I'd also have a shit ton of resources at the college to network and find jobs within the area. But I'd be fooling myself into thinking that she isn't a big reason why I'd visit for so long. Am I moving too fast with this? I talked to her about it before and she was ecstatic about me staying with her and being at college for awhile, but I'm not sure whether or not its too much.

I'd really appreciate any input. Just typing this out has made me feel better, I needed somewhere to vent. Thank you.

TLDR: Really like this girl I met two months ago at college, basically lived a bf/gf life for two months straight. I've graduated, live about 3 hours away from her, but willing to see her whenever I can. She still goes to my college. Should I ask her that I want it to become more serious when I get back home?

1366837811.0,5,self.relationship_tips,1d1bg6,24F looking for general advice while in serious relationships.,5,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1d1bg6/24f_looking_for_general_advice_while_in_serious/,"  Hi r/relationship_tips. I'm a 24F and have been in a few wonderful long term relationships (1-2 year) from early high school onward, with a year or two sprinkled in of singlehood. I guess from these years, I've learned a lot about myself and how I handle relationships in general, and there's a couple of trends in my own behavior that I think I could work on.
I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to handle emotions and internal conflicts so that I can continue learning and growing and be an even better partner in future relationships.
  
  
1 - Although it's a natural phenomenon that as people grow closer, they grow more comfortable, I feel that sometimes I get TOO comfortable. What I mean is, it seems like it gets easier and easier for me to handle things poorly, maybe because I'm so comfortable with my partner that I don't watch my words very carefully.
 
  For example, I'll get annoyed with X and instead of communicating with my partner to stop, I'll complain or make a remark that automatically puts my partner on the defensive.   This doesn't always lead to an argument but does sometimes, and if not will just stir up bad air in general. The weird thing is this kind of behavior doesn't really come from me in newer relationships, and I have no problem addressing most things productively.  My irritability sort of emerges as I get more settled in a serious relationship.  

  My question is: of course I expect to be more comfortable as I start dating someone more seriously, but why am I having trouble being as thoughtful or considerate as I was earlier in the relationship? Am I just secretly a bitch and being considerate is a facade that gets put up for new partners? Even if I'm not, I'd like to avoid the negative feelings that my behavior causes. How can I fix it?
  
2 - I know that in my first relationship, I was a very dependent person and clingy at times. This is something I've worked very hard on, and I think I've become much less dependent and clingy, although I still am probably one of the more affectionate type of partner. I've realized that sometimes I confuse the transition from the honeymoon phase to the stable relationship phase with a lack of interest or my partner pulling away.
 
 During these times, I usually try to focus on improving myself via classes or extra time at the gym to keep myself from being too over bearing and clingy. However, I'm still not satisfied with how much I can get preoccupied with the stability of my relationship, reading too much into minor signs from my partner, ect.

  It feels like my previous efforts at managing how I handle these transitions have been effective.. but only for how I handle myself in my relationship and in front of others.  I guess what I mean is, I know how to ACT secure in my relationship even if things are changing, but I'd like to address the root issue of FEELING insecure even when I logically know I'm facing a natural change.

  Can you provide some fresh insight, some techniques, or other means of helping me actually let go of insecurities and ""over reading"" rather than making me appear as if I've let go of them? I realize this might be a bit confusing.. and I'd be happy to clarify any of these points.
  

tldr; 24f has decent experience in serious relationships with some single downtime in between. A couple of individual issues pinpointed from these serious relationships that I'd like some advice on: 1 - how to maintain the same level of consideration and respect that I begin my relationship with and 2 - how to be as secure in my relationships as I act, and how to not over read small incidents. edited for spacing.",,False,,t5_2sa5c,1366838221.0,,,True,t3_1d1bg6,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1d1bg6/24f_looking_for_general_advice_while_in_serious/,

Our only way of communication is through phone calls and texts. Although we are both working, we can talk on the phone anytime we want. I normally call her during fixed times of the day. 

Here's the problem...

She told me she gets the feel that I only do things for her out of compulsion and she gets the feel that *I* am honestly not that into the relationship. And because of that she tells me that she is not really comfortable in the relationship. Truth is, I love her a lot. She is the best thing that has happened to me ever. 

A few days back she went out of town to her friend's place in another town. As given, I called her in the fixed time in the morning when I used to call her. And then texted her through the day. I didn't want to bother her with my calls so I texted her at night asking her if she had had dinner. She didn't reply. I got furious but than I slept it off. I was a bit calm in the morning but I thought I will vent some out. So, I called her in the morning and asked her infuriated why she didn't respond to my text last night. She told me ""If you really wanted to know if I had had my dinner, you would have called and asked. And don't talk about stuff like you were hanging out with your friends. You could have still called me since you could text me at the same time. How can my other friends call and you can't? It's like you do things out of compulsion in this relationship. It's like you suddenly feel it's a sense of duty to call me or text me. That's what I feel. I really am feeling very uncomfortable. I am really feeling uncomfortable and I am not sure if I will ever be comfortable with you, if you keep this going""

Tell me, guys, what's something I can do to change my habits in a positive manner. And make her feel that I am not doing things out of compulsion? How can I make her feel loved?

But every now and then I have these dreams about a past love. We were never in a relationship or intimate with one another, we were just very close friends for a long time (8 years), the timing was never right, etc. I even got some closure as to why we never dated, since we both used to have feelings for one another.

My apologies if I'm breaking some kind of rule. Hoping to get some ideas.)

I have a friend that I have had a crush on for a long time. We worked for many years together up until a few years ago. We haven't really hung out too often since leaving work although we never really hung out outside of work when we were employed either. But when we hangout we have a great time. She's going to grad school in about two months. I never asked her out because I was seeing other people, or she was seeing other people, so it never quite matched up. But I think I should get some kind of closure now while I can. Especially since I just hung out with her just a couple of weeks ago, and I cannot get her off my mind.

As I see it, I have a few options:

1. Just pour out all of my feelings

2. Straight up ask her out and date for the next two months; a summer fling

3. Tell her how I feel and then ask her out

4. Leave it alone

Option 1 seems kind of like a wussy move in the sense making me look weak and probably lead to nothing. Option 2 seems good, but I don't know if asking her out out of the blue is such a good idea. Option 3 seems like the way to go, but I don't know if saying too much would hurt my chances and look needy. Option 4 seems like the wussy move in the sense I actually would be a wuss for not doing anything and probably 
live with regret.

Okay, realistically it's between 2 and 3. How much should I say? What should I say? Or do I not tell her that I've been crushing on her for a while? I'm trying to figure out how to ask her out while maximizing my chances of not getting rejected.
