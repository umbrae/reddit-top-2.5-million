So I decided to package up the shaders I have been working on lately, and put them up on Gumroad. You can find them here! https://gumroad.com/l/VOxv

Here are some gifs of the 3 shaders in action!
1) [Clip Shader] (http://i.imgur.com/AnBVEGw.gif)
2) [Surface Cover Shader] (http://i.imgur.com/D6yGVBG.gif)
3) [Pulse Shader] (http://i.imgur.com/Kul8qqy.gif)

It is a ""pay what you want"" pack. (Yes, $0 counts too! So you can try them/use them for free!).

Enjoy! I was going to post on /r/gameassets but this seems a little too specific for Unity!

Edit:

For those who like stats! Here is the first day (well, more like half a day!). Reddit was a massive help! So many people using these shaders! :D

1368638342.0,51,self.Unity3D,1ee65w,Having wonky collisions? rigidbodies being weird? objects going through walls? Look here,61,10,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1ee65w/having_wonky_collisions_rigidbodies_being_weird/,"So, Ive seen lots of people lately asking questions about why their physics setup isnt working as expected. In most cases I come by, its caused by people moving their character/whatever with the Transform, and still expecting collisions to be accurate, which is a rookie mistake. So I decided to make a short post with a few rules of thumb. Look here:


These are a few rules of thumb in regards to physics.

* A rigidbody is simply something that tells the physics engine to watch this object.

* A collider is something that tells the physics engine where an object should collide with other objects. If the collider is a trigger, the engine will tell you when a collision happens (Collision detection), but will leave it to you to decide what to do upon collision (Collision response). If its not a trigger, the physics engine will handle collision response appropriately.
* If you want collision on something it needs a collider. If this collider should move it **MUST** have a rigidbody.
* if you want 100% fine control over that rigidbody (say, for a platformer character), it should be kinematic, and you should manipulate it with rigidbody.MovePosition() and rigidbody.MoveRotation(). Never **EVER** use the transform to move physics objects. Thats like sticking a fork into a toaster, scrambling it around and expecting the toaster to deliver toast :)


* If you want to collide with objects that does never move (obstacles, walls etc), they should also have a collider, but not a rigidbody. This tells the physics engine that these objects will never move, and they are ignored when it does collision calculations (BOOM! you just saved compuation time for the fancy effects stuff)


* If you want more realistic motion with a physics object, put a dynamic (non-kinematic) rigidbody on it, and give it a collider. Move it by using AddForce. Momentum delivered courtesy of PhysX, if you adjust the drag settings correctly.
* if you are moving a rigibody over several frames, be sure to do it in FixedUpdate. If not, the physics engine is unable to calculate m/s properly, because Update is not run at a fixed interval. It runs as fast as it can (in most cases)


* If things are still moving through walls, try enabling ""Continuous"" collision detection on the rigidbodies that move. Its slower to calculate, but more precise.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1368638539.0,,,True,t3_1ee65w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1ee65w/having_wonky_collisions_rigidbodies_being_weird/,

My presentation was kind of all over the place since I tried to cover a broad range of material for both beginners and experienced users. Overall I think it went really well and I thought this community could also benefit from it since the Unity documentation for editor extensions is, well, abysmal.

I built an accompanying Unity project which includes six different Editor scripts that implement a variety of different tools, with thoroughly commented code throughout. The different tools include

* A custom texture importer
* A custom component inspector
* A multi-object material applicator
* A multi-camera viewer (Pro only!)
* [A node-based graph editor](http://i.imgur.com/P1h7JtX.png), a la Strumpy's Shader Editor or Unreal's Kismet

I'll try to answer any questions that pop up in the thread, or you can PM/e-mail me directly! I'm open to corrections or suggestions for improvements as well, if you guys spot any erroneous information.

(new reddit post announcing launch: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1j4n1p/dynamicwater3d_live_on_the_asset_store_webdemo/)).  


I've been working on side project for a while and wondered if there would be any interest in a possible Asset Store release.  
  
First, here's the [web demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/96629022/water.html). A direct link to the [Windows build](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/96629022/DynamicWater3D.zip).  
(Updated 07/20/2013 - Now includes obstruction textures, non-square planes, and Ultra quality!)
  
It is a dynamic water system designed with Unity Indie. The water surface is a high-poly plane mesh that is modified at runtime. It allows basic user interaction, character/object interaction, static obstructions, and buoyant objects. The simulation algorithm is based off of the Tessendorf Papers on Interactive Water Surfaces. The buoyancy is derived from the voxel-based buoyancy from the community ocean project.  
  
As it uses Unity Indie, it is completely CPU-bound, so performance takes a hit. I've been toying with DX11 Compute Shaders for GPGPU processing, but not quite there yet.
  
What would be a good price for something like this? Maybe $15-25? (UPDATE: Leaning more towards the $30 mark)  
  
EDIT: I get around 400-500 fps on my rig (i5-2500k @ 4.5, 24GB RAM, 560GTX 2GB). I'll add the ability to toggle vsync (or just include a 'benchmark' quality level with vsync disabled) in a future update before release. (UPDATE: Added vsync toggle to downloadable desktop build)  
  
EDIT 2: By the way, if you want to see some neat (albeit unplanned) ""features"", go to the Buoyancy example, reset all to defaults, set the Input Damping to 1, and draw on the surface. The input deformation becomes ""permanent"", at least until you lower the damping value below 1 again. I just thought that was cool :)  
  
EDIT 3: For those curious, the water shader is from Hard Surface Shaders Free (awesome package!).

So I was wondering if I could list some things and people could add to the list, while those who understand this stuff better than us could give us some answers on how expensive they are.  Just to get started:

1. The GetComponent function of an already found GameObject.  (for instance, when you have already assigned the Game Object to a public variable then call GetComponent on it.)

2.  Does scale effect efficiency (for instance the difference between the same transform being scaled to 0.001, to 1, or to 10000).

3. How do game objects that are currently disabled effect efficiency?  Let's say I have 1000 disabled game objects.

4. Coroutine WaitForSecond: does length effect cost?  Does it matter if I wait for 100000 seconds or 1 second (assuming that nothing is running alongside either of them)?

5. Several different animations running simultaneously.

6. Length/amount of curves within a single animation.

[EDIT] Added:

7.How does a SendMessage() on a known GameObject compare to GetComponent&lt;IntendedScript&gt;() and a function call?

This is just a list to get started.  Please feel free to add your own in the comments and I will add them to the list!

Also, some of these may seem a bit silly, but I am simply asking theoretically for curiosity's sake.

I just wanted to know if it was relevant to anyones interests here. If so, I can post it. I just didn't want to get downvoted for sharing something that's part of the process, but not always in Unity. Continuing the tutorial, I'll cover how I rig the asset for animation, how to process and perhaps invoke the asset's animations into Unity (i won't be doing the animations myself).

We have around 1,000 tiled materials now, all made by artists and completely ready to use in game. They all include normal maps, specular maps, height maps, gloss maps, DX11 Height Maps, etc. 

We've been open since September 2012, and have been working very hard on everything. Since we opened, we've added around 500 new materials, and upgraded the website quite a bit. 

I'd love to get all of your take on it! What do you think of our library? Obviously the site is still a work in progress, but it's definitely getting there!

If you want some free samples of what we do, here's 50!

A lot of tutorials are great because they are polished to a shine and perfectly walk you through something, *but....* That's not how real life works. In real life, people make stupid errors and forget mundane details (Michael!!). So it's great when I'm following along and he makes a mistake and then goes through how he corrects it. It's refreshing and comforting for someone just getting into this.

Some may say that it drags because of that, but it actually is nice because it gives me time while following along to spot the error and fix it myself before he notices his own error. And it provides an element of ""achievement get!"" if I spot, and correct, one of his errors before he does. It's a good self-confidence boost. :)

I don't know if this is how the rest of the series goes, but I'm liking it so far. I am also liking the gradual progression of what is introduced when.

[Walker Boy Studio](http://walkerboystudio.com/html/unity_course_syllabus.html) - Huge collection of about 250 videos ranging from 2-15 minutes long.  Hosted on Vimeo, videos can occasionally be frustrating to navigate due to inconsistent naming (eg, video 1-30 follows 1-18 with apparently no 19 through 29).  Code is done in JS.

[Unity Cookie](http://cgcookie.com/unity/category/tutorials/) - Another massive collection.  Less awkward to navigate, but not as detailed as the Walker Boy material.  CGCookie is also putting together a ""documentary"" of sorts that follows the creation of their game EatSheep including concept art, asset creation, programming in unity and publishing.  Code is done in JS, but C# is also mentioned and used.

[BurgZerg Arcade](http://www.burgzergarcade.com/tutorials) -  A ~~small~~ collection of tutorials, largely covering the basics and whatever suits the author's fancy at the moment.  Unsure of what language he codes in, I just found this one.  **EDIT:** It's C#.  Also don't be fooled by how small it looks on the surface, each link is a *topic* which opens to dozens upon dozens of videos.

[3D Buzz](http://www.3dbuzz.com/vbforum/sv_videonav.php?fid=1ec1a7be9c0d4cf9e7a31525250a30ff) - Tutorials covering the fundamentals and a smattering of other topics.  Very nice collection detailing creation of ""my first level"", etc.  Code is done in C#.

**The story behind Futile:**

I come from a background using Flash and Cocos2D, but I've always wanted to use Unity because of the cross platform support (and because C# is great). The problem was that all the Unity 2D frameworks I found had tons of integration in the Unity editor, and lots of crazy features, but I just wanted something simple that could be used 100% from code, like all the platforms I was used to.

So I finally bit the bullet, did a bunch of research, and figured out how to create a framework that worked how I want, and it ended up working really well. It was meant to be just a personal thing, but I casually mentioned it on Twitter and a bunch of people seemed to be interested, so I decided I'd make it a bit more presentable and release it.

It does a lot of neat stuff behind the scenes, like custom dynamic batching and stuff, but the core api is really simple and will be super familiar to Flash and Cocos2D developers. 

Stuff like: 

    FContainer container = new FContainer();
    container.rotation = 90;
    container.x = -50;
    FEngine.stage.AddChild(container);
    
    FSprite banana = new FSprite(""Banana.png"");
    banana.x = 10;
    banana.y = 100;
    banana.scaleX = 1.5f;
    banana.alpha = 0.5f;
    
    container.AddChild(banana);

It's still in development and basically completely undocumented, but hopefully some people find it useful. It's completely open-source under the MIT license, so you can do whatever you want with it :)

Let me know if you have any questions, feedback, or whatever!

After trying a few different techniques on how this would work a got a rough project working without any bugs.

I have a few good ideas where this could end up but for now I'm going to post what I do have working and see what you guys/gals think. 

Project Contents

 * WaterBobbing - C# script controlling water bobbing.
 * EffectBigSplash - JS script causes a reaction with trigger to cause splash

Scene Contents

 * Buoy - Cube under the water causes the bobbing action. 
 * FallingCube - The cube that falls into the water (holds the water effect)
 * TriggerBigSplash - is a cube trigger that causes the water splash reaction

The Scene when you press play will show a cube fall into the water it will then have a splash effect and it is dissipate. the cube will then be bobbing up and down in the water for the rest of the scene the bobbing action is caused by the lower cube ""Buoy"" interpolating between 2 points on the y axis the script is easy enough to follow if you read the comments. 

The way i see this project moving forward would be boat physics and i have the basics here ill break down what need to be done and see if you guys/gals have any other ideas. You have a boat the ""Buoy"" from the scene would be the shape of a ships hull and without a mesh render-er then have triggers in the water causing the wave response like on the rotational axis. 

I hope this help's you if your using Unity Free as with unity pro you have access to buoyancy control, swimming and much much more. But this is very basic water physics i cant make it so you can swim but very basic water physics with boats will work very effectively.

**NOTES**

I'm trying to compile a list of the best paid and free options for 2D game development on Unity. So far these are the ones I've collected from tutorials and the asset store. What I'd like to get is more feedback from the community that uses these things as to what their strengths and weaknesses are, other plugins that would fit, and whatever other details.

Add'l comments: Some of these are on sale in the March Madness sale, but I'm just listing the regular price.

The Google Doc is set to let people leave comments on items. I can change it to open editing if people are interested/think it would work.

The list is mostly plugins, except for an external texture packer utility to round out one of the plugins. I'm debating opening it up to include things like Qubicle or Paint3D.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,True,,,True,t3_raa58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/raa58/the_best_2d_tools_and_plugins_for_unity/,

Water simulation is achieved by running a wave simulation algorithm and applying it to a high-poly mesh. While this is not a full-scale ocean simulation package, it works really great for small water bodies such as small ponds, pools, fountains etc. Also includes a nice realistic voxel-based buoyancy system.

Links to the demos:

[Webplayer demo](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/)

[Direct link to Windows version](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater_PC.zip)

[Direct link to Android APK](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater.apk)

Some keynotes:

* Compatible with Unity 3.5.7 - 4.2.

* Designed to run as fast as possible on any possible hardware using only Unity Free. As a downside, the simulation is purely CPU-bound.

* Tested to work on Android. It actually shows quite good performance - Motorola Droid 2 runs a 64x64 grid with some buoyant objects at 50 FPS. I'm sure it will run on iOS without problems as well.

* Contains a powerful feature that can increase performance drastically (up to 6x in some cases). Especially useful for low-performance hardware such as found mobile in devices. The caveat is some possible quality degradation, which can be unnoticeable for most scenes, but ruin the quality  in some rare occasions.

* Supports static obstruction geometry for achieving non-rectangular shapes. All collider types are supported.

* Buoyancy simulation system is made to be totally separable from water simulation. In fact, you can use it independently for things like air ballons and blimps.

* Allows setting multiple ""splash zones"" on a single water instance (see Waterfall demo).

* User-friendly editor interface.

* Code is written in a way that allows extending the asset for your needs easily. See [docs](http://docs.zimm.biz/dynamicwater/) (Docs are in early state now, but will be updated before release).


Demos include two scenes that are optimized for mobile. (Note that Waterfall scene is not optimized for mobile in *any* way and will most certainly lag *a lot*)

It has already been submitted to the Asset Store a few days ago, so I am waiting for approval soon.

Thanks for checking this out, I'd be really glad to hear feedback from you :)

The battle still wages on! Here are a couple updates from what we've learned so far:

**Web Interface**

* Background on the web interface needs to be slowed down
* It's confusing on how to get into the game via the web interface
* The screen aspect ratio for the web interface is causing some issue for some users
* We need a gameplay video / explanation 
* Creating a new character for private accounts is broken

**Game Client**

* Laggy for people who are geographically further away from the sever (hosted in Portland, ME lol)
* Trouble getting out of the south base (go through the back door facing south)
* When a player dies, they sometimes keep moving
* You can shoot / kill yourself
* You can fall off the edge of the map and not respawn
* You can't hear the other persons gun or bullets (silent death)
* Hurt indicators are all the noticeable / too fast

Anything we missed? Let us know what you think!

Thanks everyone for all the feedback! Fellow redditors and I currently in game so feel free to hop on a battle!

------------------------------------

Hey All!

My name is Max and I am the lead developer behind Centerpoint, a real-time massively multiplayer game. The goal of the game is to be a cross-platform, persistent MMO + RPG + FPS + RTS (lol) but we're starting small with just a huge, 24/7 death match. 

Right now, it's in the earliest stages of development but the game is up and running, ready for you and your friends to just hop on and play. All you need to do is go to the link below and have the Unity Web Player installed. 

www.centerpointgame.com

Also! We're doing an Indiegogo campaign soon so keep an eye out for that. 

Last but not least, if you find yourself with questions, comments, or suggestions, head over to our reddit!

I've been using this for a while, and it's very, very good. Takes a while to get your head round it but when you do you'll love it. 

You can easily create dialogue scripts with branching logic, conditional statements, redirection etc. Very simple xml-style language. It also comes with a GameKeys feature. Basically you can set and test for 'keys' within the dialogue script or in code. So you can set up quest keys, currency, inventory, and manipulate these in dialogue (e.g. player chooses yes or no to a quest and a key is set accordingly. Player speaks to an NPC more than once, set a key. NPC gives player an item, set a key).

You can basically make an entire RPG with little more than this plugin. And the latest version comes with an NGUI example.

So yeah it's pretty good. Worth checking out.

I just wanted to take a second to show you the labours of my last 18 months within Unity, Montague's Mount. What initially started off as an experiment in environmental scene setting ended up being a personal trip through my mind.

As a solo developer, working in total isolation, it has been both the most rewarding project i have undertaken, as well as the hardest and most emotionally draining; being semi-autobiographical in nature, there is a lot of 'me' in this chilling story.

I am now coming to the end of the development and just have the Oculus support to implement... i can then take a well earned breather.

In an attempt to get Montague's Mount out to the most people possible, I am currently going through a Steam Greenlight submission and could really do with your 'yes' votes. So, if you could take a minute out of your busy day to head over, check it out and 'give me the thumbs up', your support would be very well received.

I use PoolManager to avoid instantiating too much, but some people still say it lags a little. I suppose even when you're moving dozens of objects every few seconds that can get a little laggy. How would I improve that?

Anyway, any feedback would be welcome from anyone who has an Android device (performance, features, etc). I have a high-end Android so unfortunately I don't have a lower end device to see how it runs, and getting Profiler to work is a nightmare.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,False,,,True,t3_1fbq6m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1fbq6m/finished_my_first_game_android/,

Just found out about this subreddit and thought I'd share the game my team and I have been working on.

Fields of War is a massive multiplayer game focusing on large-scale battles, up to 100 vs. 100, with AI bots replacing missing players to keep the war exciting and interesting.
It is a persistent game, meaning there is no end to the fight, and every time you log in to the server you will find it in a different state according to what the other players did in your absence.

Fields of War was developed using almost entirely with Unity3D, the only exception is that we use XaitMap for AI navigation. All the network code is done using the native API.

Fields of War is available for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms and is currently in beta and under active development.

You can find out more about Fields of War on our site: http://www.thermalerosion.com/fow/info/

While most people will never need to encounter this inconvenience, some of us do (mostly tool programmers who want to store System.Type and have it serialized so that it exists between runs of Unity).

As a work-around, I wrote a simple little class that can be constructed given a System.Type object and which can give you back a matching System.Type object after de-serialization. It's really very simple in that it's essentially just a convenient wrapper around some fields with the SerializeField attribute and a call to System.Type.GetType(). Nevertheless, it may come in handy for some of us, which is why I'm sharing it here.

**[Download link here](http://bryankeiren.com/files_public/UnityScripts/SerializableSystemType.cs)**

**An example use-case would be:**

You wish to store data for each component that an arbitrary GameObject has. You can't know beforehand which components it will have and you want to be able to add/remove components at any time without having to rewrite your data-keeping class, but you'd also like direct access to the System.Type objects for each component. As a solution you decide to use a dictionary-like approach where the keys are the component types themselves. You can't use System.Type because Unity won't serialize it and you will lose your data. 

SerializableSystemType to the rescue! The class already does the hard work for you, all you need to do is use it and access it's SystemType property to gain access to the System.Type you love!",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1374080521.0,,,True,t3_1gyzua,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1gyzua/serializable_systemtype_get_it_while_its_hot/,

Firstly, thank you all so much for [your enthusiasm on me sharing any of this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1g97jz/any_interest_in_tutorials_covering_art_pipeline/). I felt I should ask since in what I have recorded thus far I only have a part of the pipeline that concerns itself with Unity, but I don't actually get there just yet. I promise I will get there though. I can even show you how this guy will fire, though that part might seem a bit complicated in my already large codebase.

I'm going to keep updating this thread with links as they finish uploading. If there's not a link for it yet, there's no video uploaded to YouTube yet. Feel free to subscribe to my YouTube channel as well as I'd like to keep doing this and perhaps do some QA ones (though I was thinking about getting a Livestream.com account for that so it's in realtime with only 10 second delay in HD quality).

Our assets aren't incredibly complicated as you'll see, which I think helps me with being able to only take as long as I have to explain it (it's still kinda long). I try to take every opportunity to help the viewer get some insight into more effective use of Maya and be thinking about the needs of the artists on your team as well as concerns with efficiency when you take your assets into Unity. I also wanted this to be as real as possible, so I think i make a few mistakes along the way and you get to see how (and if, up to you) I recover, ;).

I've been hankering after a better setup than the default Unity+Monodevelop. It's passable, but I need more bang when I'm coding than the very basic stuff it provides (I'm thinking something closer to VS+Resharper which sounds constantly like the dogs doo-dars when I read about it).  
Looking around I can't find anything concrete enough on OSX to change my current setup. I'm getting close to switching my dev environment to Windows. I'm using OSX out of convenience mostly, I prefer neither operating system so that's not an issue. I'm working off my MBP and I tend to use my wife's 27"" iMac as a second screen. If I use Windows, I'll have to ditch all that and the whole setup would become a whole lot less convenient.  
I'd prefer to stick with OSX, but maybe it's time I should break off this relationship. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.  
Thanks

**UPDATE:**  
So my first trial will go into a Parallels setup, running both Unity and Visual Studio in the virtual environment. It allows me to use the iMac screen as a second monitor (completely forgot about VMs as an option - stupid me). I'll see how it goes! I'm interested in xamarin too and will give that a whirl when I've got comfortable with the first experiment.

I started a blog a few days ago and posted some kind of tutorial on the making of a [Voxel Engine](http://learninggeekblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/1-final-result.jpg?w=660). There is probably a better way to do it but it is how I got my feet wet on the topic.

It can also serve as a good introduction to unity for some beginner. I tried to explain the processes step by step so it should be pretty easy to grasp. Full code source is available on Part 3(which will probably be edited because it's pretty simple as of now).

I would be interested in getting feedback from you on how to make better tutorial, what you would like me to talk about and criticism in anyway.

So here is the link, thanks!

**Heart of Stone**

David Stone crossed the wrong guy.  He's been shot, and left for dead, floating in the Hudson.  But the bad guy has his daughter, so he'll have to muster his last ounce of strength to save her.

*Heart of Stone* is a stealth adventure game, but the fact that you're wounded adds a twist: you're constantly bleeding out, and if you exert yourself too much, you'll double over in pain, unable to move for a while.  Can David Stone save his daughter, or is she as doomed as he is?

**Check it out**

[Play it online](http://www.barkingdoginteractive.com/heartofstone/)

[Image gallery](http://imgur.com/a/0Efa8)

Use the arrow keys to move.  You may have to click on the game to give it focus if the keys don't seem to be working.  *Try to move slowly* - if you over-exert yourself, you'll drop to your knees and won't be able to move for a while, which can be bad if you're somewhere a guard will find you.

**Postmortem**

The game was built by one person, and represents about 16-18 hours of total work.  All graphics, level design, models, and coding were original for the game jam; music and sound effects were pre-existing assets.

*What went right*

Unity.  I wouldn't have been able to make a game like this in such a short time span without it.  In addition to the 3D engine drastically cutting the effort required to get images on the screen, the physics system made things like light-of-sight and walkability trivial to implement.

Simple graphics.  I'm really happy with the visual style of the game, even though it's pretty low-fi.  The low-resolution characters, as blocky as they are, feel more expressive than if I had tried to put more detail into them, and it made the graphics reasonable to produce in the constrained time frame.

Simplified AI.  The guards' AI seems a lot more sophisticated than it really is.  The AI is ""pre-trained"" by having set waypoints for their sentry behavior, and a script drives their motion from waypoint to waypoint.  The ""idle"" states are entirely separate game objects with different graphics which are set to destroy themselves and replace themselves with the actual patrolling guard when a proximity trigger is tripped.

*What went wrong*

Doing it by myself.  This is the first time I couldn't participate directly in the game jam but tried to make a game anyway.  No teammates means you have to drastically cut back what you can do.  Also, it's less fun.  If you can, *always* work with other people on game jams.

Baking the AI for the guards.  About halfway through production, after I'd already written the guard AI, I realized I'd need some AI for Kaitlin, the daughter you're trying to save.  I had to go back and re-engineer how I did a few things to make it work for her, so that she wouldn't blast her father as soon as he came into her line of sight.  Separate out your components, people!

The Blood.  Currently, the blood is implemented by adding a new GameObject into the scene for each drop of blood that shows up on the ground, which in turn adds a new draw call.  That's not nearly sustainable, so if this weren't a game jam, I'd be writing an object to ""collapse"" all the blood drops into a single mesh.  Sadly, I didn't have time to do that, so I had to rely on players just getting through the levels (or dying) fast enough that it doesn't become an issue.  That, in turn, meant scaling back the amount of blood that shows on the floor, making it almost unnoticeable except when you get shot.  Since it was done as part of the theme of the competition, that's a net loss, but it's easily fixed with some code later on.

Unsatisfying end scene.  I'd hoped to get something a little more satisfying in place for the end scene if you manage to save the daughter.  Didn't have time to implement it, but at least I was able to reuse some code to have *something*.

There are also a few *tiny* visual glitches that I didn't have time to address.  Overall, I'm not too concerned about them.

Hope you enjoy the game!  If you have any questions, fire away.

**What is Ludum Dare?**

Ludum Dare is a competition where entrants have 48 hours to make the coolest game they can!  There are no prizes, but there are winners, voted by the other members of the tournament.

**What are the rules?**

Make a game in 48 hours based on a theme chosen at the start of the competition.

**No seriously, there's got to be more rules than that!**

Yeah, there's a bunch of rules.  You can see them here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/

What it boils down to is that there's 2 competitions; one is 48 hours.  You must work alone.  You must make all assets (Code, graphics, sound) during the 2 days.  You are allowed to use a publicly available game engine, or your own engine; however you must provide full source code for your submission.  They also would like you to post your starting code to the community beforehand, though I've never seen them be particularly strict on that point if you post it with your game.

There's also a game jam, this is much more relaxed, allows for teams, you don't have to provide source code, and gives 72 hours to complete your project.

**Why did you make this post?**

/r/Unity3d is all about making games, and this community is filled with people who are passionate.  I want to see some Ludum Dare action here and I wanted people to have a couple days of heads-up so that they can form Jam teams or prep their workflow for the competition.  It's super fun!

I have since completely rewritten the planet generation to create planets with working spherical LOD that have more interesting terrain than before.

Caleb's Cubes is my first Unity project. It's named for my son who loves the idea of me making computer games for him and giggles himself silly when he kamikazes through the cubes. He doesn't get very good scores.

I'm a novice C# programmer and I've decided to dedicate myself to learning Unity so I can realise my dream games. I started with a more ambitious project, but got a little demoralised with the challenge, so made this game instead to help get a foundation in Unity and also restore some confidence. ;)

I started work on Caleb's Cubes on April 19th and estimate that I spent an average of three hours a day on it until now, April 23rd. So the whole project would have taken me approximately 15 hours. I have been blogging my journey as well, here:

http://gregxavier.wordpress.com/

I had two problems while making it, the first is explained here:
http://en.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1ctw19/can_runity3d_help_me_with_my_strange_screen/

And the second was with building it for the web. It wouldn't display any of the GUI elements (Score, time, or restart button). I built it for every web player option it gave me, but no dice. Eventually just submitted a bug report and settled with the PC build here.

My high score thus far is 1300. :) Anyone who actually enjoys the game enough to play it twice, please let me know!! :P
Also, if anyone (maybe other newbies, or better yet, people who just love to offer advice on how a novice coder can improve his work ;) !?) is interested in seeing the code, let me know how best to make it available and I'll do so.

And a big thank you to MiniRat!

Run in 1440 x 900 (or equivalent aspect ratio).

WASD for movement

Use the sphere of righteousness to smash the multi-coloured cubes of evil. Avoid the red cubes (unless there are only red ones, then take the score hit for the greater good) while collecting the other coloured ones.

When the red cubes become overwhelming, use the purple DESTRUCTOBALL to destroy them, but be careful not to DESTRUCTOBALL the last cube!!

Edit: Gah, forgot the most important bit. Any advice, constructive criticism, or suggestion for improvement on any of the above will be gratefully received!

Edit 2: I have just uploaded a web version as well, even though it doesn't display the GUI elements for me. Maybe it will perform differently for other people's computers! https://www.dropbox.com/s/c930odgxcvpknuf/Caleb%27s%20Cubes%20for%20Web.html

Three months ago, I decided to lean Unity and go for 2D with it (target platforms and asset store). I know C# pretty well, and I made a small 2d platformer in XNA last summer. I've been looking through the script reference and doing all the 2D tutorials, and it's just not clicking for me.

What is your typical workflow/setup?,21,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/12kv6d/trying_to_learn_unity_what_is_your_typical/,"I have decent experience with programming, mostly in Java for college and a number of other programs I’ve scripted with. I’m generally capable of looking things up and figuring things out on my own. The problem with Unity is I have no idea where to *start*. I don’t know what the typical workflow is. I’m given a huge toolset and I have no idea where to begin, what to learn first, or even the context of what I’m looking for so I can do a search for information and try to figure it out.

I’m going to use a simple analogy I just used with my wife to explain the problem I’m having. I had her tell me how she goes shopping. She makes a list, she goes to the store, she gets a cart, she goes shopping. I had her break down various parts: how do you make a list? You check what’s in the cupboard, you see what we’re missing. And there’s catches as well. You want to get *heavy* stuff last, so you’re not carting it around the whole time. If you know from your shopping list that you only have a few light things, you might grab a basket instead of a cart. That sort of thing.

So I’m looking for a breakdown of a typical workflow, what I’m looking for and what to put where, how to get a simple something into a game level and the terminology/basic concepts of how to move it around, as well as a few catches I might be looking for. Even if I don’t know what a shopping cart *is*, I know that I’m looking for one and I know I need one *before* I put things in the cart. I need to know what I’m looking for. Similarly, in photoshop it’s a good idea to put a layer mask around an object to mask out the background rather than deleting it, because if you need to make changes later on with a deleted background you would have to start over from scratch. So a layer mask is like getting heavy stuff last. It saves me time/effort knowing ahead of time to watch for something simple like this.

**tl;dr: I don’t know where to start and how to proceed. What’s your typical workflow like? Mention as many key terms/functions as possible so I can look those up and learn about them.**

* You are the dark figure in the middle of the circle.

* Simply click the white squares that are attacking you to kill them.

* As you kill the enemies will spawn faster.

* If you miss a click it will start your streak back at one and reset the multiplier.

* Enemies spawn faster and faster starting at 10 kills then every time you double that.  So 10 - 20 - 40 - 80 - 160 (this is where it starts to get interesting) - 320 - 640(the last time it speeds up).

* I'd recommend listening to something good in the background.

After buggering about with XNA from time to time it seems like Unity is the thing I've been waiting for all my life. I have a couple of questions though:

1) in my game you may notice there's a white point light illuminating the player ship and its surroundings. When you thrust (lol 'thrust') it turns on an orange spotlight to represent exhaust (more obvious in other unpublished sections of the game). On the web player this causes the white point light to turn off. On the desktop it doesn't. Are there any limitations of the web player that would explain this?

2) I'm assuming that a build only incorporates assets that are used in each scene, not everything I have in my project. Is this correct, or is there some clean up I should do before building?

3) Not a question but a big thanks to Drakfyre for his excellent Cooking With Unity video tutorials. My sidescroller keeps the player stationary and moves the environment (I think his did the opposite), but I've learnt a huge amount from every video of his I've watched. Highly recommended.

And finally, here it is. It is intended as a 'bonus level' in a wider game, but it's kinda fun just on its own:

1356255536.0,17,self.Unity3D,15bl2o,I created a VERY HARD lander game in unity.  Can you beat it?,21,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/15bl2o/i_created_a_very_hard_lander_game_in_unity_can/,"Hi Gang,

I just finished a lander game written in Unity.  It has a 2D aesthetic.  The game is very hard, but the main difficulty is two-fold.
1) the ship is top heavy so balance is key (like flying a broom by the handle)
2) the ship has suspension and a joint in the middle which gives it a very unique bouncy feel.

Why I like made this game:
  I always loved flying the helicopters in Battlefield 2.  It is very hard to learn to fly those beasts, but once I got the hang of it, I still wanted a challenge.  Unfortunately for my unknowing, terrified passengers, I wasn't content just flying high and letting my passengers shoot from a distance.  I liked to get into the thick of it, buzzing between buildings, and strafing capture points, pushing my flying skills to the limit.  
  To me, the fun of this game is similar.  It might take half of an hour to learn to fly it, but those who do will hopefully find it's appeal.  It's a bit like riding a unicycle, you don't ride it to get around, you ride it for the thrill of overcoming the difficulty.

I just wanted to note that I see a lot of posts where beginner and intermediate Unity3d users will have a problem with their game, and attempting to work around it, they go off on a tangent that may or may not work, but is very far from an optimal (Or even easy) solution.  When they end up posting a question, the question is about the tree they are barking up, not the base problem.

While it's potentially helpful to be specific about what you are trying to get the scripting system/animation system/gameobjects/other components to do, you should ALWAYS include the intended results in the context of your game.  It's very possible that while someone might answer your question directly and it might actually work, you may be missing a much easier solution that is more efficient because people are answering your specific scripting question rather than attempting to solve the underlying implementation problem.

**tl;dr Please tell us what is broken with your GAME along with what you THINK is broken with your scripts.**

Additionally:

* Pictures are worth 1000 words, sometimes more.  Please include screenshots if they can give us a better idea of what's happening/not happening.  Reddit loves [imgur](http://imgur.com) and it's easy to use, but feel free to use any image hosting service you like.

* A playable demo is worth even more words than a picture.  Set up a scenario that shows the problem and make a web build so that we can see what's happening.  In this case you'll need hosting; [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) is very good for setting up public links to Unity3d and is free for a certain amount of space and bandwidth.  If you have your own servers for hosting files/http, go ahead and use that of course.

* Be open with your code/assets.  If you are comfortable sharing your project files, you will get much better and more specific answers from people.  Sometimes this isn't an option due to NDA or self-imposed secrecy.  I do wish to note that at least in the US, any code you write and assets you make are implicitly protected by copyright, whether you register them or not (You do not even technically have to place a copyright notice, though it costs you nothing and you probably should).  We are not here to steal game ideas or code or assets, and publishing your partially finished works here gives you more of a trail of ownership.  That all being said, we respect your privacy and you are under NO obligation to share anything you've made here.  It just sometimes helps a LOT with troubleshooting.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,False,,,True,t3_y0wdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/y0wdr/submission_tips_for_people_seeking_help_with/,moderator

The reason why thats in quotes is because there are a million 2D level editors that are used inside of Unity's editor but not in a game on runtime. 

Nothing is more important than having a community become a larger part of your game and make/share their own levels! 

So I made my own. Its working well so far and I wanted to share my progress and maybe see what you would be interested in if I were to put this on the asset store. 

There are two editors. One that is not user friendly but gives you more advanced features and one that is more user friendly but locks the room size to be 30x30 tiles. 

**World Editor:**
1. Exports to a .txt 
2. Set the Grid X and the Grid Y size
3. Click in the text editor and type a letter or number that represents a block.
Here are some images:

**User Friendly Editor:**
1. Select a tile from the Texture Grid 
2. Click and Drag or Click one at a time

This is the first game I've done in a while, It's called [ColorSpace](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6836390/pacbomb/WebPlayer/WebPlayer.html) and it's it's a top down 2D arcade game.

The idea is to avoid enemies, collect pellets and explode bombs to score points. 

You move with the arrow keys and double tapping will get you a speed boost in that direction.
As you pick up pellets it will grow the bomb they are attached to. Anything inside the blast radius will explode when the bomb is picked up and any bomb inside the blast radius will also explode. Any enemy inside the explosion will be destroyed and the more enemies you destroy the more points you get per enemy.

Un-exploded bombs also produce certain effects if enemies or the player go inside the blast radius

Red: Player moves faster

Green, enemies move slower

Blue: enemies are repelled


Sorry about the current graphical state of the game. It's all programmer art as I don't have an artist to work with right now. If anyone is interested in working on the project then shoot me a message with a link to a portfolio etc so I can check your stuff out!

I'm looking for a kit that:

* makes it easy to manage your sprite atlas (import your 4x sprites and then have 1x and 2x atlases automatically created, or just import the TexturePacker atlases)
* has excellent support for bitmap fonts (fast on mobile, don't really care about extra features like shadows or outlines or tints)
* has high performance tweens for scale / rotation / position / alpha
* has flexible anchors (top, left, middle, etc)
* has excellent support for parenting sprites to other sprites so you can move / rotate / scale them as a single object
* has high performance touch input support on mobile
* doesn't need to have tons of custom Editor GUI - I'm fine with doing things in code and not via the Editor. But, it would be nice for sprites to show up in Editor mode so you can arrange them in realtime.

My hope is build a free chunk of code that will abstract away the sound cues/music to a singleton GameObject, which can then be called by another script that will be attached to player objects (et al) that will automatically add AudioSources when needed, Sound banks with multiple sounds that can be randomly selected for things such as footsteps, etc. I'll be using Custom Editor scripting for this.

Giving away a bit of code I've been working on over the last few days. It a bit of procedural terrain generation code for a 2D platformer. 

Attached below is a package containing a procedurally generated mesh that acts as a terrain. Well two meshes actually. The script attached to the ""Plane Mesh"" game object generates a mesh based off an equation and applies a mesh collider, then a prefab ""curve prefab"" is added (without a mesh collider) to attach a pretty curve front end to it. I separated the two meshes out for performance, the idea being you constrain the character to the area above the mesh collider. The other mesh is just added for aesthetics.  I've added a simple sphere object with some controlling script to give an idea of what I was going for.

http://imgur.com/a/U4QC5#ohNRUrz

This code is a bastardised ""Heightmap Generator"" example that Unity released.

There is a problem tho that I haven't been able to fix (hence the giveaway) and that is at high downwards velocities (anything roughly over a velocity of 25 m/sec) the mesh collider fails and my sphere falls through the mesh. Strangely if you hit horizontally at high speed it doesn't seem to have this problem.

I've learned a lot working this problem through, and happy to move onto a different idea and you guys/girls have helped me so I thought I should throw this out there if anyone wants it. Although if you fix the problem let me know :).

Couple of notes, I've jacked up the physics iteration count to 20 to try fix the problem (to no avail) so if things run weird for you turn that down to about 7. 

Also another thing to keep an eye out if you start changing this for your own project, I've upped the gravity to a value 25 as the regular value of 9.81 was too ""floaty"" (which really exacerbates my problem).

edit: I've thought of a solution using a raycast straight down and checking if the length of the ray is below a  threshold (the diameter of the sphere in this case) but its late here and I need to sleep. I'll probably give it a crack later on and see what happens. 

Cheers

Just to let you know we released the latest version of our Concave Collider tool.
It basically computes a set of colliders automatically that fit your dynamic objects. Dynamic object's can't collide between each other unless they have convex colliders, but this is sometimes too restrictive as many dynamic objects have irregular shapes.
Our tool approximates these irregular shapes with multiple colliders, and everything just with one single click!

Also, what if you wanted the player to sometimes see themselves (or something requiring just flat out making the player control a whole human instead of just arms), would you have to animate every movement, or can you take the time to manually adjust the bones to various targets?

I'm excited to say that **Dynamic Water System** asset is finally available on Asset Store!

This is a custom dynamic water physics simulation system designed for Unity Free. Water simulation is achieved by running a wave simulation algorithm and applying it to a high-poly mesh. While this is not a full-scale ocean simulation package, it works really great for small water bodies such as small ponds, pools, fountains etc. Also includes a nice realistic voxel-based buoyancy system.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**[Asset Store link](http://u3d.as/content/lost-polygon/dynamic-water-system/)**


**Links to the demos:**

[Webplayer demo](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/)

[Direct link to Windows version](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater_PC.zip)

[Direct link to Android APK](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater.apk)

**Features:**

* Compatible with Unity 3.5.7 - 4.2.

* Designed to run as fast as possible on any possible hardware using only Unity Free. As a downside, the simulation is purely CPU-bound.

* Tested to work on Android. It actually shows quite good performance - Motorola Droid 2 runs a 64x64 grid with some buoyant objects at 50 FPS. I'm sure it will run on iOS without problems as well.

* Contains a powerful feature that can increase performance drastically (up to 6x in some cases). Especially useful for low-performance hardware such as found mobile in devices. The caveat is some possible quality degradation, which can be unnoticeable for most scenes, but ruin the quality  in some rare occasions.

* Supports static obstruction geometry for achieving non-rectangular shapes. All collider types are supported.

* Buoyancy simulation system is made to be totally separable from water simulation. In fact, you can use it independently for things like air ballons and blimps.

* Allows setting multiple ""splash zones"" on a single water instance (see Waterfall demo).

* User-friendly editor interface.

* Code is written in a way that allows extending the asset for your needs easily. See [docs](http://docs.zimm.biz/dynamicwater/).

*Thanks for checking this out, I'd be really glad to hear feedback from you :)*",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1376564856.0,,,True,t3_1kdmlw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1kdmlw/dynamic_water_system_released/,

I have thought myself programming about 4 years ago. I started with C++ (bad idea) and got discouraged. Then started playing around with Java and I liked it. 

I decided to go back to University (I was 24 at the time and only had a degree in lighting effects, I was working on movie/television sets). So I did and just finished my first certificate in software development (it's like one third of a bachelor) I have to study part time because I work full time and I have bills to pay. I'm pursuing a bachelor in computer science.

I have been a gamer my whole life, I love games so much. I always tried to make my own games (when I was younger with RPG maker) modding morrowind, making starcraft scenarios, etc. Problem is I never finished anything. When it's a contract I do for my father developing a program it's easy to finish. You're bound by a contract and you're getting paid at the end. But for my own projects, I can never seem to make it, even if I really love doing it. 

So here it is, two months ago I heard about Unity3d and everyone kept saying how easy to use it was. Realizing you can code using C# I jumped on it! This is the language I use to make all my other applications. Great! 

So I started watching tutorials, I started following Drakfyre and made a space invaders clone. And decided to jump right away into making the game I always wanted to make, ever since I played Cultures. 

I don't have a title yet, the game is set in a fictive universe where a great empire has fallen, chaos as taken up the capital and people are fleeing north to the wild lands in small groups to start over. It's a classic city-building, ressource management game with a couple of elements thrown in. For example you can eventually have multiple cities connected with trade routes (not on the same map like in Anno, think offline Sim City), You can send explorers to far away lands and if they return they'll bring back exotic food, new architecture, new ressources, perhaps a trade request and so on. 

As things are now there will not be any combat. One of my influence is The Guild 2 and Majesty. I don't want the player to have actual Control over the population. You'll place buildings, define the properties of that building, and the people will react accordingly. I feel like combat would detatch from that, watching your people fight while you helplessly watch them is not a good experience. 

I'm very sorry for the extremely long post, I've been working every weekend for the past 2 months on this and would appreciate some input from people in the field €

I just want somebody to give me something.. (this is good, this sucks, I wouldn't do that this way) because right now I'm afraid I'm just going to get bored with this project and I would really like to finish it.

Here's a little glimpse:

I'm thinking of submitting this album to the Screenshot Saturday of /r/gamedev but other people's games look so much better I feel ashamed of presenting this. I have great confidence in my game logic, code, execution, but as you can see on the images, I can't do art for the life of me.

To name some of the features: lots of different weapons, quick, responsive and dynamic gameplay, local co-op, leaderboards, a high skill ceiling and a blasting beat (by bignic) to accompany it all. 

You can check out a quick gameplay video over here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZggvugkjYiM

I slowly started out building Zenzizenzic at the end of 2012, learning Unity, coding and everything that comes with developing a game (which is a lot I found out!) over the following months without any training or education in the field, besides 15-20 years or so of playing games. During this trek I actually dropped by here in the Unity3D subreddit before a few months back (http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/193eju/the_very_first_result_of_my_experiences_with_game/), got an awesome response, and now finally I'm able to present you an early playable test version which you can give a whirl yourself.

Basically the solution was to scrap the Instantiate/destroy idea and include the outline as a child object on the cube and just enable/disable it. See below for the code.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have some basic cubes. When the player looks at a cube I instantiate a dark cube frame around the cube to kind of outline the cube so the player can see which cube exactly he/she is looking at.

I make sure the outline is only instantiated once by using a raycast and only instantiating the outline when the object the raycast hit changes.

The problem I'm having is how to destroy the outline object when not looking at the cube. I tried  making a public Gameobject named outline and then using Destroy(outline); but that throws some errors and looks like it's trying to destroy the asset itself and not the in-game object.

Any help is appreciated.

Problem code:

       Ray ray = camera.ViewportPointToRay(new Vector3(0.5F, 0.5F, 0));
            RaycastHit hit;
            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit)){
               if (hit.transform.tag == ""Cube""){
	    			
	    			
	    			if (hit.collider.gameObject != current){
	    				if (current != placeHold) {Destroy(outline);}//&lt;-- This bit was the problem
	    				current = hit.collider.gameObject;
					Instantiate(outline,current.transform.position,current.transform.rotation);
				}

Fixed code:

		Ray ray = camera.ViewportPointToRay(new Vector3(0.5F, 0.5F, 0));
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit)){

I am currently working on an online game. I was able to set up a Master Server and a Facilitator and connecting and playing together already works.
Now the problem I'm having is that I do not seem to have fully understood the way the data needs to be handled.

I think I am right when I assume that the client should make as little decisions as possible, to avoid hacking. 
This means, I don't want the client to run the scripts for i.e. damaging an enemy and dropping things when it died, but rather have the server send the information to the client. Do I manage that only by using RPCs or am I missing something entirely?

Another problem I am having is setting up a database, which basically breaks down to the same thing. I don't want the client to have direct access to a database, that would be insane. I want the client to send a request to the server and the server to handle that request. Also I only found single-player / client sided database options, but none for multiplayer games.

I did not find any topics about this, neither here nor in UnityAnswers.
I apologize for any grammatical hiccups, as I am not a native speaker.

For Unity there's [M2HPatcher](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/111671-M2HPatcher-The-Unity-patching-solution), but it's always sounded a little bit dodgy. I know Kerbal Space Program used a version of it originally and it didn't meet their needs. Then they made another patcher which also somewhat crashed and burned (much like my rockets), which only shows what a mission it is to make a decent patcher yourself. Now they're working on a third one. I actually asked them if they're thinking of selling the final updater on the Asset store at some point because their system is pretty much exactly what I'm looking for, and they said maybe, but not until KSP is done.

Basically what I'm looking for is:

* Cross-platform: Preferably Windows, Mac and Linux
* Only updates the differences, not the whole thing every time
* Allows for user login, where the user's login details can be checked against a server list

I'm using Unity right now but it doesn't have to be Unity-specific; I'd expect the updater to be standalone. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1360978902.0,,,True,t3_18m3nb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/18m3nb/good_crossplatform_game_patcher/,

Basically I was thinking it might be pretty fun to use Unity like MineCraft in a recreational way -- progressively creating worlds for the fun of it instead of worrying about actually completing a game.

I was thinking it would be neat for a group of people to put together a basic texture pack, a few scripts, and some premade objects to allow a number of people to share resources.  There can be a standard messaging system to simplify interoperability between different people's components -- similar to how MineCraft uses redstone signals for activating and deactivating different things.

Then, the fun part would be to share these worlds online for people to simply explore.

I know a lot of you probably are already working on games, and probably wouldn't want to do something like this in your free time, but I thought it might be enjoyable and possibly even relaxing -- not needing to be too concerned with game design, level design, story telling, or anything else.  It would be about making whatever come to mind entirely on a whim.

Like I said, I wasn't sure if this idea is weird or stupid sounding, but I figured I'd see what other's think about it.

Edit: I just thought of something.  There can be a UnityCraft core set of files that a community of people can upgrade and expand.  All that different people would need to do to upgrade their worlds would be to delete the old UnityCraft folder from their assets folder and unzip the new version in its place.  This core functionality can include character control, inventory, a basic set of reusable game objects, textures, sound effects, music, etc.",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1353217345.0,,,True,t3_13dyhb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/13dyhb/unitycraft/,

I saw Mandi post about Unity4 and an influx of new users into our subreddit, so I wanted to see what you guys were thinking about Unity 4.

Mandi, I sure hope you're right about the new adopters (and subreddit subscribers for [/r/Unity3d](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3d)) for Unity 4. Of all of the releases I've been around with Unity, this one seems to have the coolest reception. It's likely a blend of factors. A lot of people misunderstood the roadmap &amp; seemed to think that the new GUI was coming in this release. A lot of people thought Flash was going to be free (which was naive). Anyways, I do hope it will be received well. I'm not particular psyched about it, but I know eventually I'll have to pay up big for it all again because they'll only support future iOS versions.

For the record, I have Unity 3 Pro, iOS Pro, and have license &amp; subscription for Maya 2013. It's quite punishing for an indie like me to pay this stuff every year or every other year, especially when my game development cycle takes a year due to very small team and having to make money to afford this all while we work until game sales dictate otherwise.

I'm excited to announce that the **DynamicWater3D** package is now available on the Asset Store!  
  
Asset Store link: [click here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/9697)  
Webplayer demo: [click here](http://relicweb.com/unity/water.html)  
Windows Standalone build: [click here](http://relicweb.com/unity/DynamicWater3D.zip) (runs much better than webplayer)  
  
**Recent Updates: v1.1.4** (awaiting Asset Store approval)  
* Moved wave propagation to a simulation step coroutine, everything is now completely frame independent.  
* Added mesh interpolation between simulation steps so motion is much smoother at lower speeds.  
* Added simulation speed controls to inspector and example scene GUIs.  
* Various performance tweaks gave a slight boost.  
  
**A few caveats:**  
* Everything is currently CPU-bound which keeps it Indie-friendly, but performance isn't as high as GPU-accelerated would be. (GPU processing will come in a future Pro version)  
* It is designed to be a small shallow-body simulation, not a full-scale ocean/large-body simulation. Things like swimming pools, fountains, small ponds, etc are ideal.  
* It is limited to square/rectangular meshes, however through clever use of static obstructions and/or obstruction textures, almost any shape can be achieved (see demo for examples).  
* Mobile deployments (iOS, Android, etc) are currently considered ""untested"" as I currently lack the necessary hardware. (APK coming soon for testing)  
* The included water shader is nice, but I highly recommend the Hard Surface Shaders package (the Glass-Diamond shader specifically). They have both Free and Pro versions.  
* It currently requires Unity v4.2.0, however an update has been submitted to reduce the requirement to v4.1.0.

A few weeks ago I posted my first completed Unity3D project. It was a super simple game I made to restore my confidence after it was thrashed pretty soundly while in the early days of making THIS project, my real first project. http://en.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1cxfpn/my_first_unity_project/

Now I have Starbase Battles to the point that it has all the features I want in it and needs some testing and feedback. It's not complete. It wont be complete until I have put a fair bit more polish on it

I'm trying to make SB to fairly high standards (for a novice). I want to be proud of my first real project, and I want to see it though to completion. So far I'm really happy with how it's turning out, but while I am pretty critical of it, I do look at it through rose coloured glasses, so I'd really appreciate some feedback.

I'll stop babbling now and offer up some appropriate links...

Controls are Q, W and Z for Blue. &lt;, &gt; and P for Red.

1. Most of the level is constructed in a program such as Blender or Max, and is imported in to Unity3D/UDK. Then it is filled out with all the various interactive elements; or
2. Blender or Max is used to create many individual components which, once imported in to Unity/UDK, you would then use to construct your world.

I am a programmer who has been using Unity for the past few months. A few days ago, a friend asked me to teach some Designers/Artists on how to best Organize their project, and their (javascript) code.    
These people only have a few days of experience with unity, but that time, so I am to give them a high level look at how to best organize their projects.    
    
I had the following outline so far, and the questions for them follow each:    
    
1. How to organize your assets folder? I can keep the Scripts folder well organized, but things like Scene files, Images vs Materials, Sounds, etc... I'm a bit confused at the best way to organize each. I would like to know if there is some sort of ""Standard"" for this, so they may look at it, and possibly use it. Keeping to a standard makes it easier for other unity devs to come in and quickly understand what's happening.    
    
2. Javascript, Variable Names, and Functions. As a programmer, I strive to keep my code clean, readable, and commented. Unity is very much along these lines, but there is 'some' uncertantity, and again, I would like to know the standard way.    
What should the public variables be named? The private? My variables are always hungarian ""mVarName"" but this gets screwy with the Unity Editor, coming out as ""MVarName"" in the editor.    
Function Names? I always do ""FunctionNameHere()"", but i've seen unity docs to ""Function_NameHere"" or  ""functionNameHere"" somesuch. What's the general concencus on this guy?    
    
3. Breaking up your components. In my latest project, I had a player with many scripts on him. He had a Health script, Attack script, PlayerController and SideScrolling script, Aggro script (ammount til he goes into super mode), etc.    
I found this a lot more organized that one script to rule them all, but Unity examples seem to do that! Others, like the player controller, have sub-objects within the script that you define.

Then in your shader, use #include ""path/to/file.cg"" and you are golden. If your shaders are glsl then use that (obviously?).

I made new video showing what's new in 0.3.0.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjzE3lDcS1I

This update has been all about making the game more fun. So some new rules have been added. First, we now have a Heart-cap, this means that you can only carry 5 hearts at the time, until you level up your Heart-cap. 

You can now level up your weapons to level 3, and add boosts such as Range, Damage and Bullet size.

There is a time limit on the levels, that will start hell-mode if you take too long. I rewritten the jumping so it's easier to control, and some enemies will now charge you. Most of the graphic bits have been redrawn and lightened to make it easier to see where you are going.
Have fun!!

Bugfixes: Curser aim improved No more than one pet More control when jumping straight
Added features: Shake on hit and explosions Heart container. 5/5 One UP extra heart for heart-container Volume slider New Character animations Rewamped Weapons and power-up system New tutorial Shotgun re-made New GUI BossFight SHAKE DOWN ladders Earth gold blocks!

I spent the better part of yesterday tracking down why I couldn't click on my buttons after they moved. They seemed to take about 10 seconds to ""enable"". I could manually disable/enable the collider and they seemed to turn on a bit faster. Debugging led me to the Physics.Raycast() method failing when it should be working. I could leave my mouse over the buttons and after around 10 seconds the Raycast would magically start working again.

My 2d game uses very simple movement and I just wrote the translation code myself, skipping the built in physics engine. Months ago I noticed that the in-engine profiler showed the majority of time was spent doing Physics.Simulate. Being the premature optimizer, I turned the Fixed Timestep and Maximum Allowed Timestamp up to their max value of 10 since I wasn't using Unity's rigidbodies or physics. 

As you might guess by the numbers, this was the issue. The colliders on the buttons would not be updated after being moved until the next Physics Timestep happened. Restoring the Timestep to 0.01667 (60 fps) fixed my issue. So this is again proof that premature optimization will lead to bugs. I was sure that I wasn't going to use the Unity physics engine for my project, but I was wrong!

I re-created my Controller, same parameters, same animations, everything just like before, and the new one works fine with no code changes, so it does seem to be limited to the Controller asset itself, and luckily it was a simple idle/walk/run system so it wasn't a big deal to recreate, but if I'd had something more complex in a project I upgraded to 4.2 format, I would not be having a good night.

The drawbacks of this are clear when you try it out, such as:

- Sliding off of colliders (usually unintentional behavior)
- Inability to have moving objects that do not suit the capsule shape

I've only thought of two alternatives, which are:

- Collider+kinematic rigidbody with custom collision detection using raycasts
- Collider+rigidbody modifying the velocity directly

There are problems with the above, though. For the kinematic rigidbody, I have trouble implementing the collision detection, probably due to my inexperience. Rather than ramble on for 20 minutes, I'll just leave it at that.

For a normal rigidbody, I haven't done too much work with this. But I foresee a problem with the fact that it's a rigidbody with physics. For a character, this doesn't seem like a good idea. There's bound to be a bunch of unforeseen physics problems that'll occur (such as colliders pushing it around), and the majority of the time you might not want this with a player character.

**TL;DR:** Awesomium lets you use HTML to build your in-game GUI. Folks at Awesomium had a working Unity Wrapper, broke it. Said they were fixing it but if so they're taking a good while without letting anyone how how far they're progressing. Solution: A custom (third-party) wrapper for Unity around Awesomium's C++ API.


**For those of you that can read**:

As some of you might known, the folks over at [Awesomium](http://awesomium.com/) have developed a way for application developers to integrate a webbrowser based off of Google's [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home).

This is all because it's pretty awesome to be able to build your in-game (or more general: in-app) interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and whatever plugins a solution might support (Flash, for example).

Now, a good while ago (think months), the good people of Awesomium decided to start developing an official Unity wrapper (they also altered their licensing to be far more liberal towards indie developers, thank goodness), so that people using Unity could also use the awesomeness that is Awesomium.

However, after with the release of version 1.7, things broke. Awesomium would no longer work due to an EntryPointNotFound exception being thrown. Without the actual source of Awesomium, this was unfixable. 

People asked for fixes, the issue was acknowledged by some folks at Awesomium and there even a few mentions of a solution ""[within the next few days](http://answers.awesomium.com/questions/332/unity3d-plugin.html#)"" and ""[in a few days](http://answers.awesomium.com/questions/951/help-with-fixing-entrypointnotfound-error.html)"".


The wrapper that I've been working on today borrows a lot from the official Awesomium wrapper for Unity (the one that's broken) in terms of design, but it's not nearly as elaborate and functional as the official one was. This is on my TODO list. The functions in the wrapper simply call their C++ counterparts, and I've also added a method to allow Awesomium to copy a rendered webpage to a Texture2D from Unity using graphics-library specific code (Supported are Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11 and OpenGL). Especially this last part is nice because there's a bunch of wrappers out there that function somewhat the same (Such as the Unity Berkelium wrapper -- Unchanged for three years btw), except they use Unity's Texture.SetPixels() method (which is slower).

Currently it lets me browse the internet by attaching 1 script to an object that has a renderer and a collider attached (see screens). 

The point of this post is to gauge interest in this wrapper to see if enough people would want to be able to use Awesomium in Unity again, but don't have time to wait for the guys (and gals) over at Awesomium to release an updated, working version of their own wrapper.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I'm sure I've left some information out because I don't have a whole lot of time while I'm posting this, but if you'd like to know anything else about the project, drop a comment or a message!

Would you do the animation in Blender or in Unity's new system? How would you go about working on the model in Blender to ensure it wouldn't be a resource hog in a mobile platform?

I've recently started with game development and besides learning python, I also made up my mind about starting with unity. Not only is it something I will get in college a year from now but it also seems so rewarding to make your own game and create your own worlds.

My question now is, what's the best way to start?

Now, before you think I did not do my research, I am in fact fully aware of the different options that are laid out in front of me. I visited Digital Tutors, 3DBuzz, Cooking with Unity, UnityScript, ...

But this wide array of options, albeit very nice to have, makes it also a bit daunting and through to trees, it's hard to see the forest anymore (Dutch expression, poorly translated). 
I need something that does not just shows me how to make a game without covering how and why different steps are taken or shows me the design aspect of the program. I need the whole package, the design as well as the scripting and this on a beginner level.
Could you give me your opinion on what tutorial covers this the best?
It would need to be free, though.

If they're just world/level containers, do they always exist in the same loaded environment if you load a second scene with Application.LoadLevelAddative or is there a way to give each a unique origin? Is that basically what happens if they're on separate layers?

The challenge I'm up against is the trite desire to have a walkable ship interior and a physically simulated exterior for various space activities. I've skipped the idea of using RenderToTexture window panels for performance reasons (there'd be lots) and for the simple fact that I'm not using Pro (yet?). The workaround I'm looking at learning how to implement is to either hide the ship interiors in a single scene with the space environment, or plop them into a second scene and find a creative way to look out the window.

What I *think* I can do when it comes to looking out into space is use two cameras for the player; one standard camera tied to the player's model and a second camera parented to the ship's rigidbody and translated around a (likely scaled) local position relative to the player's position in the ship interior. If I'm understanding how that should work, I can move both cameras in real time, cull the interior from the ship camera, and cull everything else from the interior camera.

What I'm asking is: will I run into obvious feature scalability problems with either the multi-scene or culling solution? My suspicion is that multi-scene could cause horrific problems when trying to adapt to multiplayer (a long-term optional feature), but the camera culling might greatly complicate moving ship interiors and player cameras intact through area transitions.

1366626588.0,9,self.Unity3D,1cutvv,2D movement with transform.translate and collision detection...?,11,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1cutvv/2d_movement_with_transformtranslate_and_collision/,"Hi there, this might end up as a long question but I'll try to provide as much information as possible.

I'm looking for a bit of help with collision detection. I'm prototyping a 2D top down roguelike. At the moment I have a Player cube that can move up, down, left and right, one square at a time. Every time they move there is a chance to spawn an enemy from an enemyPrefab. If the enemy is within a certain distance of the player, the enemy will move towards the player one square at a time every time the player moves (every turn). This all works reasonably well but all movement is done with transform.translate.  
  
At present the enemies will move towards the player and then come to occupy the same square as the player. What I would like them to do is stop in the adjacent square instead and then spend subsequent turns attacking the player, additionally if the player attempts to move onto the square occupied by the enemy I want them to instead attack the enemy. Once the enemy is dead the player can move over their square.  
  
I'm assuming to do the things I want, I'm going to need collision detection, am I right? After doing some research it would appear that collision detection doesn't seem to work with transform.translate, is that correct?  
  
Does anyone have any advice for how I could proceed?  
  
Someone on Unity Answers suggested this:  
  
    float xDist = Mathf.Abs(transform.position.x - player.transform.position.x);
    float yDist = Mathf.Abs(transform.position.y - player.transform.position.y);
    if(xDist &gt; gridDistance || yDist &gt; gridDistance)
    {
        //move toward player
    }  
  
This works fine for the enemy, they stop in adjacent squares and begin attacking, but I'm still at a loss for how to make my player attack them instead of moving onto their square.

Edit:  
  
I ended up using raycasting and setting it uplike this...  
  
    void SearchSquare(Vector3 direction){
    
    RaycastHit target;
    if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, direction, out target, 1))
    {
        string targetName = target.collider.gameObject.name;
        GameObject enemy = target.collider.gameObject;
        //Debug.Log (""You hit a "" + targetName);
        hitATarget = true;
       //return targetName;
      Attack(enemy);
    }
    }  
  
So now when the player tries to move it first calls the SeachSquare function, which casts a raycast in the direction the player pressed. If it finds something it sets hitATarget to true and runs my attack function, if its doesn't find anything then it defaults back to movement and sets hitATarget back to false.  
  
I don't know how efficient this is all considered to be, but it definitely works. Now my player can destroy the square and spheres that are chasing him.  
  
Although I ended up using a different method to the one aDFP suggested, I probably wouldn't have even followed this line of thinking if he hadn't suggested what he did.

1. They have 0 code knowledge.
2. It needs to work on iOS and Android.

I know how to port C++ pretty nicely, but the dev time on that is really big. I can't much use other languages, that I know of, because they don't have any knowledge!    
It's been fusterating, but honestly I keep coming back to unity. It's geared towards Artsists and Designers, who have no code knowledge when they begin, and ports to everything. But... UI Only app? it feels wrong in Unity, a 3D framework.    
    
Am I right in thinking Unity is my best option here? What are some nice and easy GUI libraries I can utilize in Unity for this?

I'm completely new to Unity.  I'm making a primitive Asteroids game.  When the ship goes off the left of the screen, it needs to reappear on the right.  But it can't suddenly reappear.  i.e., as it goes off the left you see it coming in on the right.

Fortunately the screen size will remain fixed.

I'm not looking for code to copy.  Just suggestions for techniques.

One idea that I had is that when the ship goes *near* the border, a clone is made.  For example, when the ship gets *near* the left border, a clone is made screen-width off to the right, so that when the original ship does begin leaving the screen, the clone will enter it appropriately.  

Then once the original ship is completely outside of the screen, it will be deleted (otherwise we'll have clone ships building up indefinitely).

Does this seem like a good way to do it?

How would I go about cloning the ship and putting it in the right place?  The script for the ship is 'attached' to the ship itself.  Where else/how else might a script be running?  Again, I'm completely new.

Can a game object be deleted in-game?

I have been trying to figure out, if it is possible to randomly generate a world, consisting of prefab tiles/rooms that are combined, and then still use a navmesh for AI navigation?


It seems to me that the navmesh has to be baked while editing, and that it cannot be create at runtime, is this correct?

Also would it be possible to create each tile/room as a scene, bake a navmesh and then create the finished world by additively loading the scenes and combining the navmeshes ?

Edit: I found a solution posted here  http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/122545-Problem-with-NavMesh-and-Asynchronous-load in the last post, kind of ugly, i will keep this post up in case someone else is searching for a solution to this problem, or someone has a better solution.

Is there a better solution for this problem? 


EDIT: Because there's been a few requests..

        if(grounded){
        float xInput = Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"");
        float zInput = Input.GetAxis(""Vertical"");

        moveDirection = new Vector3((Input.GetMouseButton(1) ? xInput: 0) ,0, (zInput));

            if(isWalking == false){
             speedMod = runSpeed;
            }

            moveDirection = transform.TransformDirection(moveDirection) * speedMod;

        }



        moveDirection.y -= gravity * Time.deltaTime;


        controller = GetComponent&lt;CharacterController&gt;();


        grounded = ((controller.Move(moveDirection * Time.deltaTime)) &amp; CollisionFlags.Below) != 0;

Of course there's more to the script, but this is how it currently handles the movement, if I use MouseButton1 &amp; xInput &amp; zInput it'll put me in a diagonal movement that is choppy to the point that it looks like it updates x then z and looks zig zaggy instead of fluent. The only solution I've found was to add something like

           moveDirection.z = moveDirection.z - 0.05f;

Just before the end bracket of if(grounded){

EDIT #2 - Matter of a fact, I have this short video of Unity's Scene window showing the choppy movement.. (Please excuse the shortness of it, before hand I put some normal movement into it to show that everything else is smooth, just the diagonal looks like that)

What you're seeing are two cubes through my orthographic camera.  I'm trying to fake a drop shadow.  The shadow is just parented onto the blue one.  

So, if I move the blue cube across the scene slowly, you can see it jiggling all over and sort of re-sizing.

Is there any explanation or solution for this?

**Edit: My Findings so far:**

First, thanks everyone for your help.  

I have no clue if this is really practical, but it seems to have answered my question so I'm just going to do a brain dump.

* **To find the amount of pixels in 1 unit:**
 * 0.5 * screen height / ortho size = pixels in 1 unit
* **To find amount of units taken up by 1 pixel:**
 * ortho size / 0.5 * screen height = units in 1 pixel

Therefore, I see that it seems to be possible to scale a game object to an exact pixel size, given any ortho size and screen height.

* **To scale game object to desired pixel amount (hopefully power of 2, otherwise not much point):**
 * ortho size / (0.5 * screen height) * desired pixels = scale needed to achieve desired pixels on screen

And one more, with this one you can adjust the ortho size instead of the game object, to enable to you display a game object in a desired pixel amount

* **(having a little trouble here, tinkering with this still) To scale ortho size to display game object at desired pixel amount:**
 * object scale * (0.5 * screen height) / desired pixels = ortho size

Don't laugh at my mathing, this was hard for me, but I got the results I wanted.  Hopefully it's not completely bs, I have been testing this and it seems to work so far!

So with this in mind, would I be able to download unity, find some tutorials and get myself started with only a very small, shaky base in a programming language?

**Edit: After seeing several different tutorials suggested, plenty of advice on where to get help, and much encouragement, I feel like I would be an idiot to pass up on trying Unity. All I have to lose is my time, but with so much documentation/help/advice available I cannot see that being the case! Thank you everyone for taking the time to help me out.

I'm using a raycast inside my fire script that checks infront,behind aswell as left and right to look for another object tagged as ""fire"" If after such a time there isn't a fire there I'm trying to create on there.
I have it working sort of but it's creating the new fire prefab directly on top of the current one. I know how to create a prefab that would shoot forwards like a bullet or something but I don't understand how instantiate a new stationary prefab directly in front of my current fire. ( I'm using C#)

Currently if the raycast doesn't find an object tagged as fire then it calls the following method.

private void FireStarter()
{
GameObject.Instantiate(p_fire, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);

* Recursively add more rooms within the 8x8 grid, adjacent to existing rooms, until we hit a random maximum number of rooms for this floor *(this is the part I'm especially unsure about - any suggestions for an algorithm would be appreciated!).*

Some Background: You are leah. She loves cats. Cats are loose all around the world and you are starting at your neighborhood. You run around collecting cats, protecting them from dogs and possibly other dangers. At the end of each level the amount of cats youve collected is added to your house. 

Features other then what are in the prototype include: mutant cats, each bird they eat increases their size; super-power cats, each bird they eat increases your speed and jump speed; play as a cat or dog in special missions; use dogs on leashes to persuade cats movement; use toy mice to lure cats a certain direction.

Not included in the instructions: Tab opens GUI.

It's very short, I was just wondering if anybody had any suggestions. Such as darker colors, Vector art instead of pixel (I am not the best artist), changing the GUI or anything really. I feel like its missing something.
There are a few features not shown in this prototype, such as switching control of character's in-game. So I could have like a mind swap device, then there's unchaining dogs. There are birds that fly randomly, making cats eat them gains extra points.

* App1 Android: 6.68MB
* App1 iOS: 30.2MB
* App2 Android: 11.38MB
* App2 iOS: 38.5MB

Since I'm new I thought maybe this was just normal, but I saw that Angry Bots was the same size in the Android Market and iTunes.

I've never used Xcode before so I'm assuming that I am building apps incorrectly.

Here are settings/steps I set to build, everything else should be default. Can you guys look over it and shed some light on the matter?

UNITY SETTINGS

* Api Compatibility Level: .NET 2.0 Subset
* Target Platform: Universal armv6+armv7 (OpenGL ES 1.1+2.0)^1
* Script Call Optimization: Fast but no Exceptions
* Target iOS Version: 3.1.3

XCODE SETTINGS

* Build Settings &gt; Supported Platforms: DELETE iphonesimulator^2
* Build Settings &gt; Architectures: armv6 armv7
* Build Active Architecture Only: No
* Valid Architectures: armv6 armv7

I tried searching for an answer but all I could find was general build advice, nothing relating to the same exact app being much larger on iOS compared to Android.

Thanks for any help you can give.

.^1 I know Unity recommends not building for ARMv6 but I test my apps on an Optimus V which is a relatively weak ARMv6 phone so I know my apps will work on low end devices and I don't want to exclude the iPhone 3G or older iPod touches. I also tried changing the build settings in Xcode to ARMv7 only but it didn't seem to change the final build size, so I don't know if this is the issue or not.

.^2 Not sure if this is necessary.

I'm working on a prototype and I'm having a tricky time getting a feature behaving property.

I'm looking for a **field of view** effect similar to that of **Monaco**:

Or **Teleglitch**:

http://mytide.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/teleglitch-2012-12-14-15-19-47-52.jpg


These are both 2d rendering examples but I'm taking a stab at something **similar** in 3d.

Here's what I have so far.
**CODE**

Which produces this:
**IMG**
http://i.imgur.com/xc9PTbN.png

And that's alllllmost what I want - but there were a few things I wanted to do to make it feel more 2D.

Namely
* Remove attenuation from the point light so that the coloration of the surface remains consistent (not fade the light over distance)
* But still, hopefully, have a maximum range.

To accomplish this, I THINK I need to customize the lighting model in my shader. Here is a half hearted attempt at addressing this:

**CODE**
http://paste.bradleygill.com/index.php?paste_id=4511

It's results are not that great. It ignores the bump mapping which is fine, but notice the complete lack of dynamic shadows and the infinite light range. I've looked through the Unity shader documentation extensively but only really teaches by example. I don't know if this is the correct approach and have no documentation to read on functionality of CG in Unity.

If anyone knows where I should go from here or ever have an opinion on how to approach this effect, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1374280220.0,7,self.Unity3D,1io1ud,How to create a super fast update loop without using FixedUpdate,9,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1io1ud/how_to_create_a_super_fast_update_loop_without/,"So I'm working on a project in which I need an update loop that runs about 200 times per second. We can achieve this by changing the timescale for the FixedUpdate, but that also causes the Physics Engine to run much faster, which I don't want to do. What's the best way to go about creating a new UpdateLoop that runs on it's own timescale? Thanks!

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, to answer your question of why, I am not updating an in game object at 200 Frames per second. I am updating a external haptic device. The device uses motors which move tactors that stretch your skin. This device needs to constantly be sent values which tell each motor what position to move to. It works at 60fps, but unfortunately your brain is a lot more sensitive to framerate with touch than your eyes are. At 60fps, you can feel stepping. The stepping starts to smooth out around 120fps and something around 200fps feels great, and gives a really solid smooth sensation. 

I only really need about two loops that run at 200fps. In the speedy loop we will do all our math to calculate forces and stuff from our game objects. We then filter these values using an exponential moving average filter, so we get a real nice curve. The precise filtered number is then sent to the controller. At our current state, changing the timescale works pretty well, but there is really no need to calculate physics objects that fast. As more Physics interactions start occuring, it will eventually cause the fixedUpdate to run slower than the desired framerate. This is quite problematic as then the values sent to the controller will slow down and you will feel the difference. 

The solution is probably to create a new thread. I've never tried doing such a thing in Unity and have no idea where to start and what kind of problems I may run in to. 

**Edit 2:** I've concluded that pretty much the only way I will be able to do this will be to create a separate thread, which is a slightly more complicated solution than I wanted, but I can make it work. 

**Solved** Starting a separate Thread was the solution. This of course can cause some issues with keeping stuff in sync but since I'm not needing to use Unity's API in the thread, it's no problem. Did some testing and am able to run a separate thread at 9434014 times per second, so 200 times per second is not a problem. Again, thanks for the comments and ideas!

**Edit 3: For anyone else wondering how to do this**
I've been reading a bunch about how to work with Threads in Unity, it's actually not too difficult. I found [this](http://www.albahari.com/threading/) article very helpful as well as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlLEpf4Pih0) video tutorial. 

Here is a simple script I wrote to test the execution of a separate Update Thread

    using System.Threading;
    using System;

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This class shows how to make an Update loop on a separate thread that is faster
    /// than 60fps
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public class SuperFastUpdateLoop : MonoBehaviour
    {
        // These are used to display how many times per second the loop is being updated
        public int RegularUpdatesPerSecond;
        public int ThreadedUpdatedsPerSecond;

        // This is our thread that we'll use to do our super fast update loop with
        private Thread _updateThread;

        // This keeps tracks of how many times Update is run per second
        private int _updateCount;

        // This is used for keeping track of time
        private float _time;

        // This is used to lock the thread while writing
        // However, this will not be needed in this example
        private object _threadLock = new object();

	    private void Start () {
            // Start the thread that will be the SuperFastLoop
            _updateThread = new Thread(SuperFastLoop);
            _updateThread.Start();

	        _time = Time.time;
	    }

        private void OnDisable()
        {
            // Stop the thread when disabled, or it will keep running in the background
            _updateThread.Abort();

            // Waits for the Thread to stop
            _updateThread.Join();
        }
	
        // Regular Unity update loop, should run at 60fps
	    private void Update () {
            // One second has occured
            if (Time.time - _time &gt;= 1f)
            {
                RegularUpdatesPerSecond = _updateCount;
                _updateCount = 0;
                _time = Time.time;
            }

	        _updateCount++;
	    }

        private void SuperFastLoop()
        {
            // We can't use Time.time which is a Unity API, instead we'll use this
            var time = System.DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks;
            const int oneSecond = 10000000;
            var count = 0;

            // This begins our Update loop
            while (true)
            {
                if (System.DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks - time &gt;= oneSecond)
                {
                    ThreadedUpdatedsPerSecond = count;
                    count = 0;
                    time = System.DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks;
                }

                count++;

                // This suspends the thread for 5 milliseconds, making this code execute 200 times per second
                Thread.Sleep(5);
            }
        }
    }

Is there a way of making sure the second game object follows the same movement? I need to still trigger collisions, so I don't think simply setting the following object's position to be += the .move() vector will work.

I started this framework because both uLink and Photon can be quite pricy for an indie, or an individual, and let's face it, Unity's Raknet implementation sucks. So here I made Topan which implements the features I've always wanted for networking in unity, but free. Topan is built on top of Lidgren, but lidgren is not fit for a unity game and trying to use lidgren can be very hard. Lidgren is not a full framework and provides only messaging, so I used Lidgren to make my own framework. My samples do not quite show all Topan's features, but there is a bigger picture underneath and I'll keep making samples. Topan is very similar to Unity's Networking in usage, but supports more data types and features, so many unity networking tutorials will work with Topan, but Topan provides some more thing such as using something similar to hash tables in network views for data syncing, byte serialization for custom file types, and more. It is also open source, so not to keep you waiting, here is the link. Enjoy and tell me what you think.

1361134046.0,7,self.Unity3D,18pidn,Discussion on physics in voxel engines,8,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/18pidn/discussion_on_physics_in_voxel_engines/,"I've been experimenting with a voxel engine in Unity for a little while now, and like any voxel engine has to, I'm dividing the world into chunks and procedurally generating a mesh for each chunk whenever any of its voxels change. This part is pretty simple and runs well, even with very large worlds, but I'm struggling to come up with a way to handle collision detection and physics without shooting all performance to hell. Hopefully we can get a discussion going here on some various techniques that will work in Unity.

First, let me tell you about the ways I've already tried and considered, and why I don't think they work.

The easiest and most straightforward method imaginable is to simply use the meshes that are generated for the graphics as MeshColliders. This will work perfectly if your world is static (i.e you cannot add or remove voxels at run-time), but otherwise it's not good enough as whenever a mesh is rebuilt and reassigned to the MeshCollider, the physics system needs to process it which will cause an unacceptable delay and freezing the game for about half a second.

Another approach is to use BoxColliders for individual voxels, and in the same way you generate the meshes, you'll only add colliders for voxels that are currently visible, destroying them if the voxel they´re associated with is removed or suddenly hidden behind others. I've tested this and it works quite well with small worlds, but creating and destroying GameObjects is slow and the bigger your world, the longer the delay (or game freeze) when editing voxels. I'm not sure why it is like this, but with the amount of GameObjects you get with this method it's not surprising.

It might be possible to optimize this method by not destroying a collider when the voxel is removed, but rather disabling it and moving it to a separate list - a pool - of inactive colliders, and grabbing them from that list and enabling them when you need to create one. This is probably what I'll try next but it will still lead to a crazy amount of GameObjects and I'm not sure if it'll work.

Yet another method I thought of, but have not tested, was to only create colliders for voxels within a certain distance of moving objects. Then you could also avoid creating and destroying, and instead just shift them around as the objects move. This approach might work, but I'm worried it will cause problems with fast moving objects.

The ideal solution, in my mind, would be to write a custom collider for chunks, extending the standard Collider class. It could access the voxel data directly and play nice with Unity's physics system without having to create a whole bunch of other stuff. Sadly, I've learned you cannot extend Unity's built in classes, or at least not the colliders.

So, before I go any further in my experimenting I thought I'd throw all of this out there and see if any of you have any experience with problems like these, or has some ideas anyway.

Here is the game I'm working on: http://tonycoculuzzi.com/gamefiles/doomed/

In the web-player (at least for me) you have to be very close to the doors or interactive objects to activate them. And then when they move, you have to look around for where their hit-boxes might be. When you finally find where the hit-box is, it's very far away and off. I'm casting a ray directly in-front of the camera which should hit whatever you're looking at up to 2 units away, but when you look directly at the door (when opened, look at the edge of the open door model) it doesn't trigger a hit, but when you look more toward the wall, it does.

This isn't supposed to happen, and in-editor and in the standalone exe/app files, the collisions work fine.

Thoughts?

We take 2-3 days between now and the 6th January to work on whatever we want individually or as part of a team. As long as its different to our main projects/anything we've tried before. For example, the game I'm working on is mostly autobiographical, something I usually would steer WELL away from. Theres no real theme per se. Just a kick up the arse to dust off those cobwebs :)

I say we submit here when were done and on January 6th I'll create a new post for the submissions and link to everyones projects.

I've got a prototype build of a game we've been playing around with built in C# using XNA. We seemed to get a lot of positive feedback on it so we're moving forward with developing the game.

Because the team wants to move to multi-platform, we're changing from the prototype engine built from scratch in c# to Unity.

One of the issues I have is the I built the engine for a 2d game, and I'm having a really hard time finding a solution in Unity to deal with 2d collisions.

Right now I have the option of building 3d objects for collision and restricting the movement to two dimensions, but I'm not sure of the overhead of that 3rd unused dimension, perhaps somebody else can tell me how good/bad an idea that is? The other option seems to be building my own collision code then simulating the world in code and then rendering using planes.
The only requirement is that the collisions have to be handled dynamically with the game, as the players can change the collidable terrain.

There seems to be a lot of resources for 2d sprite's which is good to know. Any opinions between 2Dtoolkit, ex2d and spritemanager2 would be nice.

Thanks guys, I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but seriously any help or opinions you can provide in either case would be GREATLY appreciated

I've managed to get the Java SDK, the Android SDK and the device drivers for my phone (Infuse 4g) working. I have the ADB link going, I've gotten the Remote app working and I've exported .apk files and gotten them installed and running on my phone.  I've got more modeling experience than coding experience as far as a gamedev knowledge base but I can figure my way around procedural code okay, and I'm slowly figuring out OO code. So far, all Javascript.

 I've got quite a few questions that pertain to how things work, best practices and how things should be done. Rather than clutter up  /r/Unity with a post every few days as the ideas came up, I've collected them into one post and lettered them (in no real order of importance) to make replies to individual questions easier (indeed, I'll probably go off onto some radical tangents). Any answers or information pointing me towards finding the answers myself would be greatly appreciated. In fact, thanks for even reading this far.

On to the questions. Hold on Chewie...

**A**) Identifying individual devices - I'd like to take some unique device ID and use it or a derivation of it as the key in a mySQL table for each player but I haven't been able to find a best practice for identifying an individual player's phone (or tablet I guess, but I'm just gonna say phone). Apparently Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID isn't necessarily implemented by every manufacturer, and the IMEI can be duplicated so I was going to use MAC but then that changes depending on if the player is on wifi or cell network, right? How is this done usually?

**edit:** Since I've started this list I've found SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier . Is that a good solution?

**B**) Getting GPS coordinates - I'd like to get and use the player's GPS coordinates in game mechanics. Everything I can find points me towards using iPhoneSettings.StartLocationServiceUpdates() even if I'm building for Android, is that still the case? I got to the Unity party late, but it seems like Unity had iPhone support first and then added Android after the fact. Is this still the way to go about it or is there a proper Android call now? In addition, is there anything I can do anything in particular to minimize the games' effect on the battery due to the GPS use? I wouldn't need to pull GPS coords more than every 5-10 minutes for gameplay to work the way I want it to.

**edit:** Again, found more. Is this (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LocationService.Start.html) where I need to be looking?

**C**) Minimum API level - In the Player Settings, you can set the minimum API level to build for. My game idea isn't graphically difficult (though GUI heavy) so I don't want to cut out potential players unnecessarily but I also don't want to aim to include old hardware that isn't especially common and would just complicate the situation. If there a standard cutoff?

**D**) Audio files - Are audio files handled the same on Android? Do I need to do anything to source files as far as compression before I bring them in as assets?

**E**) Images/textures -  What is the ""really don't go bigger than this"" size as far as images and textures? If I really wanted  to splurge on the texture size for say a skybox, since it's one of very few non GUI elements onscreen, would that be a very poor idea? How about transparencies/translucency? Is that done any differently that for desktop clients?

**F**) MySQL - I want to store and retrieve player and environment data in a MySQL server. First, is this a terrible idea as far as any sort of scaling? Would I query directly from the SQL server (isn't this a security risk?) or would I send it to a php script on my server which then interacts with the SQL server?

**G**) Statistics - What numbers should I be shooting for to get a pretty wide range of playability across hardware? I was told when developing Unity for PC/Mac, that draw calls are the most important thing to keep to a minimum, and if you observed best practices in doing that, the rest should follow nicely. First, is that total bullshit? Second, whats important on Android?

**H**) Other security concerns - I would imagine the largest concern would be an open vector into the SQL db, are there other problems more unique to mobile apps that I need to be worried about?

**I**) Screen Orientation - I want to switch between landscape and portrait in different stages of the game, I assume that its possible to override the Default Orientation setting in the player settings?

**J**)  Application.genuine - Does it work reliably?

**K**) Purchased Scripts/Systems - I have a couple of purchased scripts from the asset store that I'd like to use in my Android project. Is there a way to verify scripts will work on Androids interpretation of the script vs desktop interpretation? Did that last sentence even make any sense?

**L**) Load Times - What do people usually put up with as far as load times? What's your personal goal to shoot for as far as the longest a player has to sit looking at the same screen? What are the major offenders as far as load times?

**M**) What do you wish you knew when you started on Unity for Android?

If you've gotten this far, you're among the most steadfast of redditors and I applaud you. I realize this was a wall of text, but I figured one long post was less disrupting than numerous one-question-each posts.

I've been tinkering with Unity's networking support today, and while it's easy to get started and use it, it doesn't seem to lend itself to security. 

They have [Network.InitializeSecurity](http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/Network.InitializeSecurity) which takes care of network layer security (but it doesn't seem to authenticate the server), and their docs say 'You will need to account for this [...] at the game layer.'

Here are my gripes with using Unity's networking to do ""game layer"" security:

 * It doesn't seem to be possible to restrict who's allowed to call Network.Instantiate/Network.Destroy. For security, you'd want only the server to be able to instantiate and destroy objects.
 * RPCs always arrive with NetworkMessageInfo#sender set to -1 (if you used RPCMode.All and this is the sending machine) or 0 (every other case, indicates server). Since I can't find a way to filter RPCs on the server, this means that **any** connected client can call **any** RPC method on other clients, and the clients can't tell it's not from the server. The only solution to this involves not being able to use RPCMode.All in your code, and instead use RPCMode.Server to fake broadcast: You'd have the server relay the information with a unique magic number for each client, so that the client can ascertain that it came from the server. This also means you need to re-implement buffering (since you can't use RPCMode.AllBuffered).

Are these concerns correct - or did I miss something in my tinkering? If they are, what do you guys use for networking your multiplayer games?

As alternatives, I've seen the following thrown around:

 * [Photon](http://www.exitgames.com/Photon/Unity) - has semi-authoritative support, but doesn't integrate well with Unity (according to [this post on the unity forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/113321-Experience-with-Unity-Networking-Photon-and-uLink-UnityPark-Suite-for-My-Giants))
 * [uLink](http://muchdifferent.com/?page=game-unitypark) - seems to have good security and integrates well with Unity, but even the indie license is tad expensive for my hobbyist needs (EUR550)

Any others? Any input on these?

* If you go into the next room, after a while the door closes behind you and the previous room unloads.

* If you open a new door in the next room, it closes the previous door, unloads the previous room and loads the next room.

* When a room unloads, everything in the room (enemies, pickups) reset, unless they are marked by a global flag (for example if a bridge is broken, the bridge will stay broken even if you go back).

There are quite a few 2d map making plugins out there, and many of them look really great, but I'm trying to find one that will work best with my needs rather then spending money on plugins to find out something isnt quite what I wanted. I'm hoping there might be a plugin that we can modify or use to save time and hoping anyone with experience with these might be able to throw in any advice or suggestions on a plugin, based on our needs below. Also, hopefully any answers to this post will help other people in the future as well.

What we need and what we're doing/looking for:
We're planning on creating a 2d multiplayer rpg with some maps hand created, others randomly generated (yay another 2d game). The game will be top down view, not side scroller. We will have our own artwork, raster based pixel art, or possibly vector due to scaling. We plan on making this very basic at first because it's a learning experience for us (two ppl working on this). I've programmed server side before (although not for a game), so this project is sort of an amalgamation of all my previous experience and learning more about game development as well. Regardless, we want to begin with a very basic 2d map with client(s) &lt;-&gt; server interaction.

My question is, what might be the best supported 2d map making plugin for unity that offers map creation with collision detection that is not just standard shapes but rather poly based? My main concern is ensuring that collision and what not are also later on able to be synced with other connected players through a server. Likewise, we're looking for something that can scale big and small, something that can support larger maps without consuming a lot of resources. With that said, obviously it would be bad coding if the entire large map was generated for a client but only the user viewable area was seen (i.e. 5km x 5km map with .25km x .25km viewable), thus I'm not sure if there is a map making engine that only renders the user viewable area when compiled.

This is usually my process when exporting characters into Unity from Maya.  

1. I select the mesh and just export as an fbx. More times than not this works and everyone is happy.  If this doesn't work,

2. I reset the bindPose, export.  If this didn't work,

3. I bake the joints.  I don't like doing this since it tends to increase the size of the fbx considerably, but if it looks right I am satisfied.  If this doesn't,

4.  I select all the joints and mesh and export.  This shouldn't work, but sometimes it does.  If not this,

5.  I bake the joints, remove all IKs and Constraints and select the entire rig and export as fbx.  Not terribly efficient, but also have found satisfying results.

My question regards the generation of the level.

I've also tried making normal planes with trees and objects attached to them, and then saved them as a prefab. This was ok, but I feel that when I start to make my objects more detailed with better effects, more grass and better trees it'll severely affect performance.

Unfortunately we wont have access to the console for a while, so at the moment we're gonna focus some things that aren't reliant on console input (such as items, environment, that sorta deal), got a few questions though and was wondering if I could get some help answering them.

1- Do C# scripts work with Android, and can we transfer them from regular projects to Android ones by copy/pasting whatever? (This one seems kinda stupid I think, but I literally have no Android Dev experience not even tech demo's so better safe than sorry right)

2- Does anyone know the differences between controller inputs (OUYA, Dual Shock, X360) on the console and how they'd act differently within the environment?

3- Do you need the OUYA connected at all times for deving in Unity, or just for whenever you want to Debug/Run the game?

I greatly appreciate any response from you all and it would really help out, we want to dive in and get some of the more trivial core stuff working while waiting to get at an OUYA.

Also was considering building an Input script to handle each players input, allowing to test gameplay on PC and then just change the script around when it comes to OUYA dev with the new inputs, is that feasible?

Should probably also note, I'm mainly a designer, still relatively new to programming (only really been trying it out for the last 6 months ish) so sorry if my post makes no sense and sorry for the long post.

I ask because right now I have a script the detects a left click and does a raycast from the screen in to the world to see if you clicked on a mob and if so it selects the mob.  Now I added an action bar and I am realizing that I am going to need to make sure that if the click happened on the action bar then the unit selection code should not consider that to be an attempt to select a unit.  I could put code in the unit selection script and in my action bar script to make this work, but that seems like it could get messy real fast as I add more and more uses for left click in my game.

I am thinking I should create a central place to handle all user input and send messages to components when the input system determines that a user input was meant for a specific component/script.  I started writing this game using the BurgZergArcade [Hack and Slash tutorial](http://www.burgzergarcade.com/hack-slash-rpg-unity3d-game-engine-tutorial), and from that tutorial I had added ""CSMessenger Extended"" from [http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=CSharpMessenger_Extended](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=CSharpMessenger_Extended).  I am thinking of using this to send messages from the input system to the components.  Does this seem like a good way to do it?  What do you guys do?  Do you put your input code directly in to the components that make use of the input or do you put it in a more central place to manage the inputs coming in?

**Edit:
After hearing about how I shouldn't be using Unity's GUI, I figured out and got a test running of using 2 cameras, one for the 3D GUI (yay 3D!) and one for my 3D world.  This definetly shows me though that I should consider having the mouse click code in one place so i can do this:**

    if (raycast hits my gui) {
      have gui respond
    } else if (raycast hits a mob in 3D world) {
      select mob
    }

**So this leads me to now ask, does anyone here have experience using separate cameras for GUI and 3D world?  My test works nicely, but right now my GUI and GUI camera are just sitting around under my terrain :D  Do you guys that use this technique put the GUI in a separate scene and LoadSceneAdditive?  I'm thinking at the very least I will need to add a plane below my 3D GUI objects because having them float in mid air is pretty disorienting to work with in the scene.**

A: Not mecanim compatible and 
B: Not something that's in terribly high demand.

So, I guess since i'm going to give it a try if people are interested i can see about documenting my progress so that others that might be interested can find something out. That said, i'm willing to bet that others have tried this so if you have, let me know what you've discovered does and doesn't work.

The focus i'm hoping for is to emulate the Incredibles' Elastigirl or DC Comics Ralph Dinby. If you've had any experience trying something like this, let me know as i'd greatly appreciate it. 

AS it stands, however, some preliminary testing shows that Unity will heed scaling of bones so that's a start... It also seems with these preliminary tests that it can also factor in non-uniform scaling (though i don't know if this is doing seriously gnarly stuff under the hood.)

Update, Day 1: So, i've been doing some research into this... some limitations, some issues... i would suspect that the process of exporting the scaling itself is going to be the real issue here since every package handles the exporting process in it's own way. Right now i'm working on a way of linking a stretchy bone up in such a way as to harness the constraints system. this is working somewhat though there's some rather odd voodoo going on under the hood which i think i'm going to have to brush off some scripts (it's to do with wiring parameters together.) As it stands, however, only one other thing... mecanim will read them as long as you don't change anything in them. when it does, it just drops that info. so, Legacy is the direction i'm headed.

Update, Day 8: So, with the help of some redditors and people over on Polycount I've been able to get a handful of videos that show how i built wha ti needed... note, this is for max and you agree to use this information at your own risk because messing about and making some errors in the expression/wiring phase could cause some seriously bad stuff to happen.

**The Goal Is Simple:** Keep Bobby from exploding for as long as possible. The longer Bobby survives, the higher your score. The more coins Bobby collects, the more power-ups you can buy. The higher your score, the more you can brag about being at the top of the world-wide Leaderboards!


**How You Can Help:** If the game sounds interesting, please, grab it from the Play Store and give it a try! Any feedback ( praise, criticism, improvement ideas, bugs, etc ) would be greatly appreciated :-)

Having lots of 1x, 2x, and 4x sprites and spritesheet animations is very expensive in terms of asset size, and we want to keep the download small(er), so for this game we'd like to try and use animated vector art.

It looks like pretty much the only plugin for this is RageTools Pro.

Has anyone here used this plugin much? It seems good from the videos, definitely a learning curve (to be expected), but I just hope the workflow isn't too frustrating for artists.

I'm thinking that our workflow will be:

   * generate puzzle icon in external program, save as SVG.
   * Import SVG into Rage Tools
   * animate the object

An example icon and animation would be a flower with an idle animation of it swaying in the wind, or its petals opening up and blooming. Fairly simple. We're not talking full on characters here.

None of the animations would be physics based. I'm not trying to setup a skeleton for some kind of IK rig either. Just simple timeline animations. If it's easier to do the IK rig though, I'd like to know that.

What happens if we have to change the SVG? Does the existing animation work basically get trashed and you have to redo it all?

Is creating animations with this really frustrating? I know when I try to use the Editor to edit Ragesplines or do any kind of non-code animation I want to shoot myself. I end up doing everything in code.

We might have 20-100 of these symbols with animations on the screen at once, and each one might be a few thousand vertices based on the complexity. So that's 40k-200k vertices on the screen. Hopefully the mobile performance is still good (we're targetting iOS and Android).

I guess it comes down to how it will be used so I'll try my best to explain my goal for the first test with it. I want to create a small landscape and have a little ball (PC) roam around it (easy enough). I'd like the focus to(obviously) be the sound and music though. I'd eventually like to put real assets in there that can fight and have adaptive music to fit the mood but I'll be happy with two balls, and as another ball gets close to the PC the music changes.

What I want is to shoot a 'thick' ray with a radius the size of the crosshairs and highlight anything that intersects with it.

So far the only thing I've tried is putting a larger trigger collider on the object in addition to a solid collider and setting raycasts to hit triggers. This worked OK if an object was isolated but it got confusing when trying to pick up objects with overlapping triggers.

Hello My Unity Brethren!

I'm having trouble deciding on this one. Should my game have an open-world? or should it be scene based? 

**I ask this because I'm not entirely sure how to make a continuing story on one scene. (Like one quest leading to a next one etc... without losing progress every time you load another scene.)**

My Ideal game would be an open world with a campaign, with optional side-content.

*The Reason I ask,* is because I'm not a programmer, I'm more of a storyteller / artwork type of developer. I do have a programmer but I'd like to know if there are any resources available on this subject. For peace-of-mind and understanding I guess.

I am racking my brains over, *How will the player enter and exit buildings*, *How to save differences between scenes (Like a enemy outside your house remains when you enter and exit)*, *How to save and Load progress from any point on the level*... Just a bunch of questions relating to an open world game.

**OR do I sacrifice the open-world aspect for a more linear approach, yet this would be more approachable from my own perspective. My game is very story based.**

If anyone could share some insight, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Unfortunately, saving the project and many other operations bring up a dialog asking me to resolve unfixed textures, resetting these bitmap types to normal map and degrading the way things look; in the long run, this means at some point I'm going to miss what this dialog is saying and then mark these as normal maps, dicking things up.

*  Generating cells (From here, I can quite easily generate their actual contents, but for the most fundamental thing, I'm lost)

* Confining units / buildings to cells

* Movement of units with certain characteristics (restricted to cell types, only move x cells)

Just a (hopefully) quick clarification.  I may be over thinking this, but which is more costly - a raycast or a collider?  I am making a game and am trying to save memory and keep speed up however possible.  I have an enemy object that checks if it can see the player and then reacts.  I have 2 solutions so far, and both seem about the same speed with my smaller scale tests.

1) Have a sphere collider  (trigger not collision) on the range of hearing/vision.  When the trigger is sent off the enemy then raycasts at the player to see if they can see them.  If they do, they respond.

2) I have an enemy that raycasts at the player out to a similarly set distance all the time and only engages when the player is close enough.

Which of these is better?  In my mind, the raycasting is more processor intensive if it's processed each frame.  I am not sure of how triggers on colliders are handled.  Are they in a dumb state (idle) until triggered, or is it using a similar amount of processing power?

If I were to scale this - let's say to 50 enemies - which would be better?   

Or is this whole approach wrong?

Thanks for your time and I appreciate any help/advice/insight you are willing to offer.

I'm no stranger to this program, but there are some problems that I just can't solve on my own, so I've come here to ask for help on an indie game I'm making.)

I'm making a stealth game, and one of the features I want my game to have is the ability to flatten the character's body against a wall, and move left and right while against the wall. This is what I mean:

http://www.leetgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/metal-gear-solid-2.jpg

This is a classic stealth game mechanic, but I'm not sure how to pull it off.

Here's what I've come up with so far (temporary art):

http://i.imgur.com/VwyyE.png

The red cube at the character's feet is a collision box. When the character enters that collision box and presses a button, the character's rotational value becomes equal to the rotational value of the box, and she can only move left or right. Each individual red cube will always be oriented to face away from the wall it's next to.

However, I don't think that this is the best way to implement this feature. I have no idea how to tell the character something like, ""You can only crab-walk X distance before you have reached the edge of the wall and have to stop"". Also, this method requires me to manually place red collision boxes everywhere, which are all at the right size and position...that would be a giant pain in the long-term.

I'm Gabriel Ochsenhofer, a programmer from [Cats in the Sky](http://www.catsinthesky.com). We made a free Unity3D plugin in the past (FarseerUnity), and now we're happy to introduce our first commercial plugin, Texture Tools:

[Introduction video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0yhtIS0wh4)

Texture Tools enables you to tweak some aspects of your textures inside Unity. All filters/tasks run in a separate thread, so they don't stop you from working on your game scenes.

The current version of our plugin contains:  

*  Solidify - Removes white halos from transparent textures. Solidify fixes the fully transparent pixels of your textures so they can be displayed properly when they are sampled by the engine.  
*  Resize - Lanczos (great for reduction), HQ2X, HQ4X and HQ4X Smooth (great for enlarging pixel-art textures).  
*  HSL - Hue, Saturation and Lightness/Luminance. This can be useful if you're building for mobile and can't afford a custom shader due its performance cost.

Here's the asset store link if anyone's interested:  
[Texture Tools 1.0.0 ($10)](http://u3d.as/content/cats-in-the-sky/texture-tools)

What is planned for future versions:

*  A simple texture editor for pixel-art painting and/or prototyping (multiple layers, brushes, etc.) (1.2.x);
* Example scenes for using Solidify, Resize and HSL in-game (the filters don't depend on Editor classes, so they can be used for processing textures inside a game) (1.1.x);

I am a game programmer, back-end web programmer, designer and animator so I've been pretty fortunate being able to take on development work largely on my own. I'm looking for another project to sink my teeth into, one that revolves around an online persistent world that players can log in to, become a part of and interact with. The problem is, I know game development from the client-side, but I have no clue what I'm looking at in terms of cost, the type of server setup, whether I will have a master server that maintains the overall game state and tracks users and that is relayed to servers that host various sets of users. I don't know what I don't know at this point. The idea is to start small, with basic functionality, something as simple as having the player, enemies, spawn points and pickups. Not to the scale or complexity as WOW but the same type of network setup (I guess). You will not have access to hundreds of inventory items, the world will be small, and there will be no quests or objectives. Just spawn, find enemies and kill them. So on to my questions:

1) What type of network/server setup will I be looking at for a game as described above that is persistent? Master server, child servers, client? Master Server, Client? Is Unity even capable of this? From my research there are tools out there but it will require tons of work to get rolling.

2) I have a dedicated server (4GB ram, QuadCore, 10TB Bandwidth) that I pay for each month that is pretty much just sitting around with a few sites hosted. Could this handle being a starting server? If not, am I looking at costs that would explode beyond affordability, is this just a pipe dream for an indie developer without the big front-end budget of a AAA studio? I'm not thinking that I will consume millions initially or that it will even get to that point, but what am I looking at for 100,000 concurrents, 1 million, 100 million?

3) Lastly, what am I missing here? I am not naive, I realize that this will take a lot of work and dedication and I do not intend to go about it on my own by any means, I'm also not looking to do it for free and I realize that there is potentially a large cost in this. Mainly I just want the low down on what this type of game would require in terms of network connectivity. I am not one of those kids who got the free version of Unity and want to start out making an MMORPG, far from it.

I currently have a rigidbody setup with an addforce command controlling the movement according to the accelerometer axis. However, i find it pretty unresponsive at best. The main problem I'm having is that whenever I tilt the phone and the ball collides with something, that spot becomes sort of a neutral spot on the axis. So instead of just tilting the phone to the same degree the other way, i have to do double the work just to make it move. I have debugged the velocity as well to see if my code was acting up, but nothing has shown in that.

I have no idea why that is, and i can't really find a better solution then using addforce.

An idea that i have is setting up a threshold for the accelerometer, so then the ball has a speed limit, and tilting the phone forwards or back is measured along that instead of just being thrown straight into code like at the moment as : target.rigidbody.AddForce(input * rollForce);

Any further information on possibly using Rigidbodies to my advantage would be much appreciated.

I have been laying down the basic mechanics for an RPG.  
The player can press the tab key to cycle through nearby enemies and left click to attack, which removes health from the current target.  
Everything related to this works fine, and I have removed all bugs.  
The only problem I am having which I haven't been able to solve is that when I target one enemy, get close enough to attack it and left click, it removes health from every enemy in the scene.  No matter how far away they are.  
The enemy's health is displayed on a plane which floats above the enemy and faces toward the camera.  The texture of the health bar is changed at different health levels to indicate this.  I am suspicious that using this method to display health may be the cause of the problem but I thought I might ask for help here first before I bother recoding it to work in a completely different way.
...
Here is the script which controls how the player attacks and targets enemies:  
.........

private var attackDistance = 3;

var targetInfo : GameObject;

	{  
		target = FindClosestEnemy();  
		var oldIndicator = GameObject.FindWithTag (""targetIndicator"");  
		Destroy (oldIndicator);  
		var targetHealth = target.GetComponent(EnemyHealth);  
		Instantiate (targetIndicator, target.transform.position, target.transform.rotation);  
	}  
	if (target != null)  
	{  
		if (Input.GetButtonDown (""Fire1"") &amp;&amp; (Vector3.Distance(target.transform.position, transform.position) &lt; attackDistance))  
		{  
			targetHealth.health -= 1;  
    	}  
    }  
}  
  
function FindClosestEnemy () : GameObject   
{  
    // Find all game objects with tag Enemy  
    var gos : GameObject[];  
    gos = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(""Enemy"");   
    var closest : GameObject;   
    var distance = Mathf.Infinity;   
    var position = transform.position;   
    // Iterate through them and find the closest one  
    for (var go : GameObject in gos)  {   
        var diff = (go.transform.position - position);  
        var curDistance = diff.sqrMagnitude;   
        if (curDistance &lt; distance) {   
            closest = go;   
            distance = curDistance;   
        }   
    }   
    return closest;      
}  
  
function clearTarget ()   
{  
    target = null;

So, guys. I just started a project this morning. On all my little fun experiments, I've used a presupplied character controller. This time, I made my own, and here's how I did it: I made a simple movement script, attached it to a box, and then parented it to the main camera. Simple, right? Just in case it's necessary, here's the script I wrote:

    public var speed = 5;
    function Update () {
        var newPosition : Vector3 = transform.position;
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.W)){
        newPosition.z += speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.S)){
        newPosition.z -= speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.A)){
        newPosition.x -= speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.D)){
        newPosition.x += speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        transform.position = newPosition;
    }

I then made boxes and a wall. Their positions and rotations are locked on all axis, and the character's position is locked on the y axis. The character's rotations are locked on all axis as well.

So, I made them all rigidbodies to attempt to make it so that that the character would stop when it hit something. It worked, to the extent that the character could not pass through boxes. However, it gained permanent momentum in the opposite direction that it encountered the rigidbody at. When it came to a wall, the character was flung through it and gained tons of permanent momentum.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I did a bit of research, and saw somewhere to check the ""Is Kinematic"" button. However, all this did was make the character pass straight through the other boxes.

If you want to actually see this happen, go here:

I need help understanding how to access a script on an object that is stored in an ArrayList.

I have a piece of code that fires a raycast, gets back the collider that was hit and then sets a 'selected' variable inside a custom script called 'Selectable'.  I then append the collider to an ArrayList called 'selectedUnits'.

However, once I've added the collider to the ArrayList, I can no longer call GetComponent&lt;Selectable&gt;() on the collider!  I get an error from unity's compiler saying 

**Type 'object' does not contain a definition for 'GetComponent' and no extension method `GetComponent' of type 'object' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)**

But if I use Debug.Log to print 'selectedUnits[0]', I get back a collider, not an 'object'...what's going on?  

My code follows:

    public ArrayList selectedUnits = new ArrayList();

    void Update()
    {
        SelectUnits();
    }

    void SelectUnits()
    {
        Ray rayUnit = camera.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
        RaycastHit hitUnit = new RaycastHit();
        int unitLayer = LayerMask.NameToLayer(""Unit"")
        int unitMask = 1 &lt;&lt; unitLayer;
        if(Physics.Raycast(rayUnit, out hitUnit, Mathf.Infinity, unitMask))
        {
            hitUnit.collider.GetComponent&lt;Selectable&gt;.selected = true;  //This works fine.
            selectedUnits.Add(hitUnit.collider);
        }
        else
            ClearSelectedUnitsList();
    }

    void ClearSelectedUnitsList()
    {
        for(int i=0; i &lt; selectedUnits.Count; i++)
        {
            selectedUnits[i].GetComponent&lt;Selectable&gt;.selected = false; //This breaks.
        }
    selectedUnits.Clear();

1. Does Unity Android allow me to code in C# despite the lack of .NET? I don't know Javascript and while it isn't a dealbreaker necessarily, I'd prefer not to have spend any time learning a new language if possible. 

2. How does Unity games perform on Android emulators? I've never programmed for Android but I've heard nothing but horror stories about its emulators. I have a Droid 3 and a Xoom, but would like to emulate other devices. I have programmed in C#/XNA using Windows Phone emulators without any hassle or problems.

3. Are there any particular things that are lacking in the basic unity android edition (but are in the $1500 version) that you find more than slightly detrimental to making your games?

I use an orthographic camera in my game. Lately I changed the way I make houses to use texture atlas.

The problem is that since then I got some strange artifacts when the camera is at a certain position.

Like this: http://i.imgur.com/Od2yH53.png

I got those before (like the one on the door which doesn't use an atlas) but it got really visible with the atlas.

I know it has someting to do with the camera orthographicSize but I can't get it right no matter what I do. And it has to work on all resolutions.

-----------

Here's how the camera is configured

var s_baseOrthographicSize = Screen.height / 64.0f / 2.0f;

Camera.main.orthographicSize = (s_baseOrthographicSize * 10);

---------------

How can I avoid these ? It seems to be more rare on the scene window by the way.

Edit: the texture import settings: http://i.imgur.com/T6TsP2z.png

Edit2: What I'm calling atlas is in fact a spritesheet (or tileset), didn't know ther was a difference before today

  How hard is it to get things to work with the mecanim system if I create everything (model/rig/animations)?  I've watched the tutorials and they make it seem pretty easy to use but I'm skeptical of how easy it will be once I'm using it and get my assets imported.

 My understanding is that there's some base animations that can be applied to any rigged model as long as they have the same # of joints.  Do I just go create some animations for a particular character and then as long as my other characters have the same # of joints and joint hierarchy, those baked animations can be applied to an infinite amount of other characters?  

Also, for character diversity, is it easier to set up a finite # of different characters with individual features (ie 5 females w different clothes &amp; hair and 5 males w different clothes &amp; hair) or is it better to have swappable clothes / hair meshes (like a mr. potato head toy), put them on a rig, and then put them through mecanim to animate?  I'm also worried about it being buggy and from a lot of other posts by other people, it looks like things get messy with the joints when it's not exactly set up like the default unity model.

Sorry for this barrage of questions, I'm new to this whole mecanim thing and since it's just me working on all these character assets, it looks like it would make things a lot more efficient than rigging and animating 10+ characters.

Quick question and I thought I would post it here because I dont have the fully paid version of NGUI yet which means no support.

How do you organize your NGUI assets? I am setting up a menu and it has several screens, so I have a ""main menu"" panel, and then under that I thought I would set up several more panels for each screen. Is that a bad idea?

Then, under one of the panels, it has several slides depending on buttons you click - so I thought I would give each one of those a panel.

Well by the time I got that far, I started running into all kinds of glitches. Like when I add a new widget, its huge and if I try to scale it down it gets all blurry like its too small.

I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I guess I could put everything in one panel but then it turns into a huge mess that I cant manage.

One other thing, I have all these panels and they show up in the panel tool, but when I go to add a new widget in the widget tool, I can only add to my ""main menu"" panel, not all the other ones I have.

So I ask you:

* How do you manage all your NGUI Assets?
* How do you organize stuff?
* Can you nest panels? Or is that bad..

Any other tips?",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,False,,,True,t3_1j11pq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1j11pq/managing_your_assets_in_ngui/,

Example: I have different Head Models, Torso Models, Arms Models, and Feet Models. They're all the same size, height, and length so they're pretty much universal. Think of them like Lego men and women where you could mix and match different articles of clothing and size.

My question is how would I create a skeleton rig so that I could make animations for the my project and then just have the models loaded to the right joint rig?

I'm currently using Cinema4D as a way to animate the models. I've created a whole joint rig using the ""Joint Tool"" by loading up a base torso and merging the rest of the models together so that the joints are ""One Size fits all"". I'm having a little trouble after that though.

From what I understand, you pick a starting point resolution and design everything around that. After that, there is a way to control global scaling of the UI based on the users end resolution.

I was testing control schemes for two handed weapons with the Hydra: http://youtu.be/gDlozuuWoKc

The position of the rifle is bound to the position of the right hand, and the rotation follows the location of the left, in this case just using transform.LookAt. It's cool, but it feels kind of wonky. I'm sure I could tweak it some to make it feel better, but since the Rift doesn't track translation it makes it damn near impossible to ""shoulder"" the weapon in a natural position. You end up having to hold it out directly in front of you to look down the sights and aim effectively. 

I also did some testing using one handed weapons with both position and rotation bound to the weapons respective Hydra controllers. That feels a lot more natural than the rifles do. Here is a link to a video of that if anyone is interested in seeing that in action: http://youtu.be/8GJqk58NjTc
