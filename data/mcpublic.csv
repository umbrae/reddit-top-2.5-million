--------

The whole topic has deviated. I want to get to the bottom of the being a dick rule.

Not everyone is aware that it is a 'catch-all' for shit behaviour. Why not just write ""Mods reserve the right to remove players at their discretion"" if you want a catch-all.

Players like myself and others will point at the current ruling and say ""Get rid of him. He's being a dick"". And then matters like this arise.

In relation to what happened between me and Pkome I just think it's a shitter when I would have to log off for a while or stop what I had intended to do because somebody else can't play the game with consideration for others enjoyment.

AGAIN! I am not anti-PvP. I'd play on PvE if this was the case. It is not.

A rule we do have is ""No harassment"". For those that don't know the definition it is as follows:

""A feeling of intense annoyance caused by being tormented.""

Now as far as I can see this is another rule that gets ignored to the discretion of the mod online at the time. But whatever.

It's becoming clear that the only way to beat the people that ruin the game for you is to go find another server. What kinda server is run with that ethos in mind?

Anyway. There's my opinion and my clarification on what this thread was about. It's raised a ton of discussion which is quite cool, so I hope the mods will get together and discuss the matter.

Thanks to the people that were constructive. As for those who can't read or think ""Go somewhere else"" is the answer, well take your own advice.

Thanks! -Pete

It's time this was either elaborated on and enforced, or dropped from the wiki and rules board.

Certain players get their rocks off it seems jerking around other players and typically ruining the gaming experience, either by constant PvP or trolling through text chat.

Responses of ""Go PvE"" can fuck off. I enjoy the survival aspect of the game. But this isn't COD here. It's a game where killing is an aspect of it, not it's sole intent. If it gets to the point where the game becomes unenjoyable for it's users then something is wrong.

The Reddit servers shouldn't be represented by childish sociopaths whose only form of pleasure is making other players mad and frustrated. It will eventually come down to the abandonment of the server in favour of one run with a better sense of fairplay by mods who care about the well-being of it's users.

I'm not throwing my toys out of the pram and I'm not complaining about the PvP extents on the server. I'm trying to address an issue that does need to be spoken about properly and an outcome reached.

Someone stole the gold block and replaced with a yellow wool block and put the redstone torches back on. They then deconstructed whatever scaffolding they used to get to the top, leaving not a trace of evidence unless you got close enough to see the different texture at the top.

Hi all,

Now that details of the exploit our servers have been facing today are becoming widespread, we wanted to give you full details of exactly what has been happening today, what we’ve been doing about it, and how we plan to respond moving forward.  Skip to the TL;DR if you don't need details.

----

First sign of trouble was at 5:54am* this morning, when Notch logged onto Survival.  No reason to suspect it wasn’t legit at the time (besides healthy skepticism), but his IP connections and the subsequent attacks have since made clear that this was a test of the exploit.

At 9:06am, a user illegitimately logged onto Creative as forty_two, and immediately gave admin privileges to another player, who in turn gave those privileges to 10 more players.  Collectively, this group used the full range of admin powers to attack C, such as WorldEdit, bans/unbans, etc.

We became fully aware of this about 20 minutes later. As we began to assess the damage, we first muted chat on C, then eventually shut it down and moved it to a staff whitelist so staff would work on repairing the server while the admins investigated what happened, exactly.

It quickly became clear that someone had gained access to forty_two’s account, which we then immediately banned, unbanning it only once forty_two had changed his password.  Nonetheless, the hackers were about to log onto S using forty_two’s account again - forty_two confirmed that he hasn't logged into any unknown servers lately ruling out a MITM attack. It's also impossible that the hackers cracked his password so quickly. (A few other admin accounts were compromised, but not able to do any meaningful damage.)

Once we realized that hackers were able to bypass authentication entirely for certain users, the following actions were taken by staff, particularly the tech admin team (who did an awesome job staying on top of this all day):

* Immediately took backups of the S and P servers (nothing was lost)
* Brought down all servers
* Parsed through the logs of every account that was compromised and given illegitimate admin privileges, to make sure all damage was undone (config reverted, bans/unbans undone)
* Made a  [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/wjxg5/server_admins_did_notchsephblingetc_log_in/) to /r/admincraft with the thought of cross-comparing plugin lists to find one with a back door. We decompiled and pulled PEX and NoCheatPlus apart, and found no back doors. 
* Retrieved the most recent available backup of the C map (approximately 10 hours old), to replace the current, griefed C map
* Set up the temp chaos map (event.nerd.nu) once it became clear this wouldn’t be fixed soon.

To eliminate the chance of it being a plugin bug/backdoor, we put a honeypot server up on c.nerd.nu with a [minecraft protocol](http://wiki.vg/Protocol) proxy attached, to record how they were triggering it, and [advertised this fact](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/wk6ey/creative_and_whitelist/). Within an hour, the hackers took the bait (twice) and connected to the (now whitelisted) c.nerd.nu server, again as forty_two.  The details of what we learned are on [barneygale’s r/minecraft post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/wl0zy/psa_exploit_in_minecraft_login_server_hackers_can/), but the net result of our investigation is that there was a major exploit in the Mojang authentication servers, and thus a proper solution was beyond our ability.  Essentially, **it is possible for Mojang authentication to be bypassed entirely for some users**, and Mojang needs to fix their authentication server to remove this exploit.

We’ve spoken to Mojang staff about this, who requested we not reveal the details of this exploit.  After lengthy discussion, our planned response was to inform trusted server admins when possible, but hold off on posting a general PSA about the exploit, as it is unfortunately easy to execute once known.  However, since full details of the exploit are now circulating rapidly, we feel it important to get everyone on the same page (especially if you have your own servers to protect!).  Our recommendations for how to handle your own servers are listed in [barneygale’s r/minecraft post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/wl0zy/psa_exploit_in_minecraft_login_server_hackers_can/).

*all times in US MDT

----

Here are the actions we will be taking, moving forward:

* **Once the exploit is resolved, servers will go back up on their current maps. C will unfortunately be subject to an approximately 10-hour rollback** from the time of bringing the servers down; P and S will be exactly as they were at the time, no progress lost.
* We will be reconfiguring our backup scheme to ensure more recent backups are available in the future.
* We will be expediting our move from PermissionsEx to bPermissions, which (among many other good reasons for a switch) will prevent any users from modifying permissions in-game.

Thanks for your patience and understanding as we handle an issue that has been largely out of our hands.  And please remember to thank everyone who did an incredible job staying on top of this for 18 hours now and counting, particularly our tech admin team.

----

**TL;DR:** Servers brought down due to Mojang-level exploit allowing bypass of Mojang auth for certain users; C was attacked using this exploit; all servers will come back up with current maps once exploit is fixed (S and P exactly as is, C with ~10 hour rollback); go enjoy temp chaos on event.nerd.nu!

We're happy to announce that we are ready to launch PVE and Survival this weekend!

* **s.nerd.nu** (survival with PVP) will launch **tomorrow (Saturday) at ~7pm EDT**
* **p.nerd.nu** (survival without PVP) will launch **tomorrow (Saturday) at ~10pm EDT**
* [Convert to your timezone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) (above times are in New York / GMT-4 time)

Thanks to everyone who has been working to get the servers and maps ready, and to everyone else for your patience! :)

Some details on how 1.5 Redstone Update features will work on the servers:

* Hoppers will be completely allowed, but there will be some restrictions (enforced by LWC) on where they can be placed. In particular, you won't be able to place hoppers adjacent to any LWC-locked object (chests, furnaces, etc.) unless you are the owner of said object. This will prevent someone from, for example, placing a hopper next to a chest they don't own and stealing its contents. This will NOT prevent a hopper from being placed next to an unlocked chest, even if the chest is locked later, so be careful!
* Since they are containers, you will be able to LWC-lock hoppers, droppers, and trapped chests. Remember on S: ""No use of LWC-locked blocks for the purpose of base defense or any other use than to protect the items within the locked block."" (Also remember that you can't LWC-lock minecarts with chests, since they are entities.)
* Minecarts with hoppers won't be allowed, as we have no way to prevent them from accessing LWC-locked chests. Minecarts with TNT also won't be allowed, for obvious reasons (though we may be able to turn them on for S if we can disable block damage).
* Anything else in the 1.5 update will be available in its full glory!

The only plugin we haven't gotten working fully in 1.5 at this point is SafeBuckets. We'll be debugging it today; if we can't get it working in time for launch we'll let you know what the alternative arrangement will be.

Look for more specific details about the new P and S revisions later this weekend!

As it currently stands there is a lot going on within nerd.nu

There are lots of new staff coming on, some internal reshuffling and the everyday jobs that go into keeping these server playable and friendly.

Behind the faces of our [pretty](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Ooer) front line staff there is a small team of [tech admins](http://katmou.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/gremlins-gizmo.jpeg), we are those guys that reboot things when they die, implement fun new things like [the new modreq](https://github.com/NerdNu/ModReq) and [safe buckets](https://github.com/NerdNu/SafeBuckets). But we also tend to hide in the background and just fix/implement things as we see them.

this is...*bad*.

When a problem arises, most people are completely in the dark. For those of you in [#RedditMC ](https://gamesurge.net/cms/GameSurge_Overview/) you probably are in the best position to know what is going on.

\#RedditMC is where we all hang out, chat about new features, receive warnings that the servers are down and generally interact with the wider community.

That, however, is no excuse on our part.

So starting now we will hopefully be taking a more interactive role in the community, posting fairly regular updates on things we are working on, things we know about, and our frequent demands of pizza.

*So, down to business..*

There are some things we are currently aware of,

1. Live maps are down
2. Abuse of logging on Survival
3. Rollbacks and frequent crashes on PvE
4. Chaos server down
5. Length of downtime upon crashes
6. Mob limits [S &amp; P]
7. Frequent spam attacks

Phew, quite the list :(

Not to fret, most of it we are working on! :D

#### Live maps ####

Not a whole lot of movement, due to the performance problems dynmap introduces to the server it is not feasible for us to be running a live map right now.

A more frequently updated carto should be in the works, the possibility of hosting it at the conventional /maps/ location on nerd.nu is a tempting option.

#### Logging during PvP ####

As many survival players well know there has been a lot of talk about how to deal with loggers, there have been several attempts at a technical fix, with many instances of a logout cool down being tried with some success on the server. However the bugs outweigh the gain, things like switches inventories, item duping and invulnerability are words associated with logout cool downs, and not something we are able to allow to happen.

Thus a reactive approach was taken, a new plugin called NoLog is being trialed on S as we speak. Without going into boring detail it works as follows, if you are take damage from another player and log out less than 10 seconds after that a violation is sent to in game staff, and also recorded to logs, building a history for each player that can be called upon to reinforce bans for logging. Currently running quite successfully.

#### Rollbacks and crashes on PvE ###

PvE is somewhat the black sheep of the nerd.nu family. With the introduction of PTM in the generation of the map the number of entities grew considerably. With so many overhangs, large caverns and other dark spots for mobs to spawn the server quickly became bogged down with the massive influx of entities. To combat this there have been things such as the light a tunnel competition, in the effort to limit the places these mobs can spawn.

Despite the noticeable positive effect this had on server load it still was not enough. So a hard cap on **all** mobs was implemented. As the setup currently stands every 5 minutes all loaded chunks are scanned for mobs, a quick count is done and if there are more than 25 entities in a chunk the extra ones are removed. The plugin will remove hostile mobs before passive, making farms still viable.

The outcome of this test has been a much more stable server, ram usage is down and crashes are a lot less frequent. Overall there will not be much change to the limit. Given the option of stability or overpopulated farms, we figured you would take the first :)

#### Chaos ####

This follows on quite well from the previous point. As it is, we are using every bit of ram we have to host all 3 servers, and even then we are reaching our upper limit and crashing under exceptional circumstances. The resources to run chaos right now are simply not there, we have expended all we can just keeping the other 3 up and operational. No ETA.

#### Lenth of downtime on crashes ####

There are currently 3 active tech admins. With Wraithguard01 working on heavy development of CommandHelper and Amaranthus on holidays we are doing all we can to cover the time zones, but we are only 3 people, bear with us :)

Steps are being taken at creating bots to automate the restarting of the server when a crash is noticed, but we are still a while from a robust solution. Your best bet as always is to send an email to outage@nerd.nu - Most of us get push notifications to phones, and from there we can get to a terminal asap to fix the problem.

#### Mob limits on S and P ####

As previously stated these limits are there to give us some measure of stability, by no means do they prevent critical aspect of the game functionality, just spread your farm over multiple chunks if you really must have 500+ sheep.  They will probably not be removed any time soon.

#### Frequent spam attacks ####

As most S and C players will know we are quite popular for spammers, a new plugin is being trialed. Currently an admin of any type has the ability to effectively 'lock down' a server. With the option to disable all chat/commands/join messages we can somewhat combat the visible effect on the servers.

We are running low on funds to host all three of our Minecraft servers. In an effort to limit bandwidth and maximize server resources for Survival and PvE, our more popular servers, we have decided to permanently close down the Creative server. While this was a tough decision, the administrators ended up deciding unanimously that with our lack of money, P and S are the two servers which will remain running. Please complete your builds by this weekend; Creative will go down as soon as the new P and S revisions begin. A backup of the map will be available shortly after the server closes.

Survival and PvE will likely receive an influx of players after Creative is closed down. We encourage our regular P and S players to share their food and diamonds with any Creative immigrants who approach them. Bans will be issued to any players who accuse Creative players of 'taking over their server' or similar offenses, as this is a blatant example of hate speech.

Additionally, in an effort to clean up our player base, the administrators have collectively decided to scan the entire Creative map and create a list of all players who have built structures comprised of 100 or more blocks that are deemed by our team of admins to be 'derp'. This list of players will be banned from both Survival and PvE. While appeals will be allowed, it is unlikely that most of these players will be unbanned, as their lack of respect for the map proves them to be toxic players. A complete list of players who will be banned is available [here](http://tinyurl.com/26qgesb).

Absolutely nothing.

1) Reddit servers depend on several admin plugins written for the hMod platform, this allows protection of areas in creative, grief stick etc.




2) Minecraft was updated, this broke how hMod platform worked.





3) hMod can't be updated. The code was written very poorly and is very outdated.




4) Bukkit is the future but currently it's not the present as it's unstable and incomplete with builds coming thick and fast as they work on getting it stable.




5) We're currently testing bukkit and several plugins including some plugins have been made by AllNaturalX and author blues.




6) There is a whole bunch of issues with using different version of the plugins and versions of bukkit that are causing hassle.

",59,2,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/thw20/in_one_week_may_18_pve_will_reset_to_a_new_map/,"That’s right! The time has come for PVE to get a new map. Over the past three months we’ve thoroughly explored and conquered Rev 7 and it’s been an incredibly fun experience. I hope you’re all proud not only of the stunning things you’ve built, but also the strong and supportive community you’ve helped to create. I know there will be many questions, I’ll cover the most common ones now and will try to answer any additional questions in the comments.

 
**When will the reset happen?**
In about a week, on Friday, May 18th. The exact time will depend on the availability of tech admins.

    
 
**What is the status of the current revision?**
The current rev is still alive and running. **All the rules (*such as no griefing*) continue to apply**. After the reset the map will be made available for download at [nerd.nu/backups](http://nerd.nu/backups). Use the next week to finish your projects and get things ready for the download. 

     

**What is a reset?**
When a map reaches the end of its life we take it down and replace it with an entirely new one. The old map is saved, taken offline, and made available for download. The replacement map will be completely new terrain. Everyone starts fresh with an empty inventory. Nothing can be carried over from the old map. 

    
 
**Why reset? I like this map the way it is.**
PVE maps generally last 2-3 months. The current (and seventh) revision started on February 19. We reset the map either when it breaks or when it gets old and activity levels drop. Three months is a long time to be playing on the same little patch of land and sea. A fresh map brings exciting new opportunities and gives everyone, from newbies to old farts, a chance to explore an untouched wilderness as naked, diamondless equals. 

______________________________________________

Finally, I’d like to give a bit of information about the new map to help everyone with planning.

It will be a 6000x6000 map made using the current vanilla terrain generation settings. There will be no resource plumping. Ore levels, clay distribution, cave sizes and distribution, ect will all be vanilla. Basically, to help ensure the map is stable, we didn’t mess with anything underground. Above ground is a different story, however. 

The surface of the map has been heavily modified with World Painter. Much of the ocean has been drained (though there is still plenty of water for those that want it) and you can now find extensive forests and plains stretching across the empty basin at level 45. Explorers will find massive mountains, sandy beaches, expansive 100 block wide rivers, and more. Additionally, the biome sizes have been increased dramatically. Imagine a desert that you could explore for many in game days and still not reach the edge. Vast jungles that stretch from the highest peaks to the depths of the former sea bed. A massive stinking swamp where the mooshrooms roam free. You’ll find it all on PVE Rev 8!

Hello, all.

I wanted to give everyone a quick update on why PvE was still down right after the map reset, and what we're doing to work on it. Yesterday, many of you noticed how extremely sluggish the server felt. Initially, some assumed it was just the influx of players and chunk loading, but the tech admins soon suspected something more.

Initial probing found that the server was using far more memory than it should have been, and the reason for the instability is that it would run out of memory and crash. Last night, we pulled PvE offline. This gave Amaranthus a chance to strip a copy of PVE of all its plugins, and re-introduce them one by one in order to get to the heart of the memory problems. This process led him, and us, to believe that the source of our issues lie with WorldGuard trying to run far more processes than it should be, thus increasing memory load to the point of crash.

I'm still a little fuzzy on all the details, but needless to say, Amaranthus and all the tech admins are hard at work trying to solve the problem so the map can get back up as soon as possible.

Every time anyone tries to talk about this, the offenders come in and tell us to stop whining, don't go on S if you don't want pvp, etc. 

Most likely everyone knows what I'm talking about, but to be clear, there are a few people on S that seek out unarmed players or players minding their own business working on projects, and kill them. There is no way to protect yourself from this besides hiding well enough that no one can find you. And like someone mentioned on another thread, you may as well just be playing single player.

If that's really what the greater S community wants, then I will bow out and never go on S again. But from the conversations I've seen, it seems like there are a lot of players from P and C that would *like* to play on S for the pvp experience, but also want a certain level of maturity in how we use pvp. 

I'm not going to write a book here, but what I am asking is this. Please, can we have an actual conversation about what the S server is? Maybe I just don't get it, but nothing about it seems like a fun place to be and I honestly don't understand why anyone enjoys playing with that kind of shit going on.

As [Bukkit](https://twitter.com/EvilSeph/status/231613334351380482) and plugins continue to be a work in progress, we're still figuring out which 1.3 features we'll be able to incorporate, and how. However, we have worked out many of the planned changes for the new revisions, so now's as good a time as any to start announcing them.

Two things to keep in mind:

* This is not a complete list - more to come in a future Part 2. We haven't figured out what to do with all the new 1.3 features, so if it's not listed below, we don't know yet.
* Nothing here is permanent. We're taking a wait-and-see attitude with many of the 1.3 changes to see how they work on a large server. Please bear with us until we can try them out (at which point feedback will be much appreciated!).

----

**The Planned Changes** (part 1)

* The **difficulty** of the S server is increasing to **hard**.
* **Map Sizes:** 6000x6000 worldpainted for C, 4000x4000 large biomes for P (future expansion possible), 4000x4000 vanilla for S
* All new 1.3 **structures and world gen** will be incorporated as-is on S and P. Please note that player traps continue to be banned on P, including modifying and/or expanding the traps that exist naturally in 1.3 structures. 
* All **blocks** that are new to 1.3 will be allowed on all servers. Note that ender chests do not require LWC, since other players cannot ever access your personal ender chest inventory.
* Rules for killing **passive mobs** (including all villagers and farm animals) are *not* changing on S or P. In particular, all mobs are fair game for killing on S, whereas the policy on P is that passive mobs should be left alone if they are clearly claimed.
* **Villager trading** is planned to be incorporated as-is on S and P.
* We will be reverting to **vanilla XP** on S and P - with the 1.3 XP/enchanting changes there is effectively a 4x buff already, plus many new ways to get experience (mining, smelting, mob spawners). On P, make sure to protect any mob spawner you intend to use for grinders, etc.
* On S and P, **cocoa bean farms** will be treated just like netherwart farms (which incidentally work in the overworld now). That is, you may use other players' farms so long as you replant every plant that you broke.
* We intend to change **minecart behavior** to be the same as boats on S and P - that is, like vanilla, but with any unoccupied entities being removed from the map every 5 minutes.",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_xp3c5,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/xp3c5/planned_changes_for_our_new_13_revisions_part_1/,moderator

We’d been debating whether to wait for everything to update to 1.4.3/4 before launching the new revisions, but ultimately we want to get you guys back to enjoying our main servers as quickly as we could.  Hope you enjoyed another taste of chaos in the meantime :D

1346639495.0,51,self.mcpublic,z9dcf,Mob farms are a problem on PvE. Here’s what we’re going to do about it.,54,3,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/z9dcf/mob_farms_are_a_problem_on_pve_heres_what_were/,"As you may or may not know, the current situation with mob farms on our server has gotten out of control. At the start of the rev we asked people to be responsible and reasonable with the sizes of mob farms. Most players have been good about it, but a significant number have not. As a result we have way too many mobs on the server and significantly higher lag than we otherwise should. The situation needs to be remedied. I’m going to provide a breakdown of the nature of the problem and then list the steps we will take to help fix it.

__________

**The Problem**

*1*) There are too many mobs. We have well over 10000 mobs, we need to be at like 5000 or less. The vast majority of these mobs are animals from farms. Therefore, many farms need to have their populations reduced. Keep in mind this is not single player. This is an online server that hosts hundreds of players. Many single player play styles such as massive farms simply are not possible here. 

*2*) It is pretty much impossible to define in concrete terms what numbers are reasonable for a farm. It depends on need and purpose. It depends on how many people are allowed to use it. It depends on how many other farms are in the area. It depends on how often the chunk is loaded. There are a million things to consider. On top of that, how to even define a farm? The real world doesn’t fit nicely into “farm” and “not farm” categories. There are simply too many variables at work here. One number or definition won’t cover everything and encourages exploitation and gaming of the system. This type of problem demands a subjective solution. 

*3*) The previous solution to this problem, a hard plugin enforced mob cap, was bad. And that’s being diplomatic about it. The plugin mob cap punishes the entire server quite severely for the excesses and selfish actions of a relatively small number of people. This is obviously something that we don’t want to do.

_________________

**The Solution**

Quite simply, we (the PvE admins) are going to be using our judgement. We will begin culling farms that we think have excessive numbers of animals and as a result are hurting the server. We’ll never wipe out a farm completely, but we will start reducing them to reasonable sizes.

*Advantages to this approach*:

It’s humane. This allows us to try and take as many variables as possible into consideration. Farms that are actively used by large numbers of people (in a city for example) would be allowed to have more mobs than a private farm in the wilderness. It allows us to talk to people and figure out the situation before taking action. Basically, it allows us to allocate a limited public resource (CPU time) based on need. It’s also more fair than a hard cap. People won’t lose all their animals just because they were offline at the wrong time. People that like to play as farmers can still have their small collections. 

*Disadvantages*:

You have to trust us. Sure, the potential for abuse and favoritism is there, but I hope that over many months our actions as server admins have spoken for themselves. Thrawn, Ooer, and I work hard day in and day out to provide a fair, fun, and friendly server for all of you to play on. I hope you can look at how we’ve conducted ourselves and how we’ve run the server and trust us to act as neutral arbiters. 

__________

**Additional changes to mob policy**

I would like to take this opportunity to announce that all farms must now make an effort to lock themselves to the general public. Farms should be protected and locked behind an iron door with a redstone torch. We will no longer be replacing animals unless they are griefed from a locked farm. 

The reason for this is because the logs are hard to read and search. There are many (on the order of dozens) of animal grief reqs every day. Each one can take 15-20 minutes to figure out and deal with. Frankly it’s too time consuming and stressful and we don’t want to deal with it anymore. None of the admins want to log on and spend all their free time searching through logs day in and day out. So we’re asking you to help us help you. Secure your animals. 

Keep in mind that although “the map is open for exploration” and we don’t allow people to create large inaccessible areas, there is an exception for private animal farms. 

___________

**TLDR**

We’re not allowing absurdly large animal farms anymore. Admins will be removing animals from farms that are too large. We’re asking you to trust our judgement. The alternative is a hard plugin enforced mob cap and no one wants that. 

Farms need to lock animals behind protection + iron door and redstone torch. We won’t replace animals lost to easily accessible farms

Finally, if anyone has any creative solutions to this problem that aren’t mentioned here and that you would like us to consider, please post and we can talk about whether or not it’s feasible.

1366449192.0,42,self.mcpublic,1cqf1m,"A HUGE downloadable list of 90+ waypoints for Reis Minimap for PvE including EVERY city, portal, end portal, rail station, grinder, and major landmark on the map thus far.",49,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1cqf1m/a_huge_downloadable_list_of_90_waypoints_for_reis/,"If you haven't installed Rei's Minimap and wish to you can find a download and instructions here:

http://www.minecraftdl.com/reis-minimap-mod/

Ok, so I've spent about 10 or more (probably way more) hours on this the past few days. Basically, my point was to make a waypoint for just about everything on the PvE map and to help alleviate questions like ""where is X grinder / portal / town"" As far as I know, I've got just about every city (there are over 20 separate cities), EVERY nether portal (overworld and netherside), EVERY end portal, and every grinder I could find (I'm sure there's more), and additional landmarks (like Poseidon). 

If you're on the overworld map in the nether by the spawn portal then you're in this list, and then some. If you're not, then you can either message me in game (shredtilldeth) or you can post here with your EXACT x,y, and z coordinates and I will add you. I've found the ""generic"" coordinates on the overworld map to be somewhat accurate, but also somewhat unreliable so hence one reason for this download. This is not a diss to UMC or Zuziza who put the map together but sometimes I had trouble locating a specific city (Necropolis, for example. Thanks to ZombieEater123 for the help in locating his city and end portal) due to non-exact coordinates. In fact, the overworld map was a HUGE help in this project so I commend everyone involved in the making of it. This is to be seen as merely an addition to their hard work.

I believe this to be an excellent tool for brand new people to the server, as well as veterans who want to expand their waypoints. I've labeled most major cities by their boundaries. For example, Seneca has multiple waypoints. Seneca East, West, and North, in addition to their rail station and nether portal coordinates. So, if you're coming from the north to Seneca you'll find the Seneca North waypoint most applicable because that is the waypoint that was marked on the north border of Seneca and, it is marked on a north road going to Seneca. Some of the smaller cities only have one waypoint. I tried to mark most stuff due to easiest way to get there from the roads. Also, I personally traveled to each and every waypoint in this list to obtain maximum accuracy. The ""generic"" coordinates are good but they don't include the y coordinate which can get confusing sometimes, especially on this map where the Y coordinate can be particularly important.

If I have gotten a coordinate wrong for your city, grinder, or landmark, just message me here on reddit or in game and I will update this list. If you have a grinder or other landmark you want listed again, just message me here or in game but PLEASE include EVERY x,y,and z coordinate and I will add it or fix it. If I don't get all 3 coordinates this defeats the purpose of my list.

I organized the list in general by quadrant. You can install and rearrange the list if you wish by following the directions below:

To install coordinates:

1. Go to your .minecraft folder.
2. Click Mods folder
3. click the rei_minimap folder
4. Replace your p.nerd.nu.DIM0, p.nerd.nu.DIM1, and p.nerd.nu.DIM-1 files with those in the download.

OR, to add my files to yours without losing your current waypoints (for secret stuff or personal locations) or vice versa:

Open the p.nerd.nu.DIM0, DIM1, or DIM-1 files with notepad. DIM0 is the Overworld waypoints, DIM1 is The End, and DIM-1 is The Nether dimension. 

Copy and paste wanted waypoints into these files, put them into the .minecraft/mods/rei_minimap folder and you're good to go.

You can also re-arrange the waypoints in notepad this way if you wish. Also, just a disclaimer, if you fail to backup your stuff and lose waypoints I am not responsible. You should ALWAYS backup your stuff first!

Also, I know its been said a million times already but as someone who has LITERALLY traveled most of the map in person I really commend Thrawn on her EXCELLENT map design. I absolutely love how much of the map is realistic, we've got a fairly large ocean, we've got rivers that can actually be traveled via boat (as opposed to vanilla terrain), mountains that actually LOOK realistic, as well as highlighting the really cool stuff Minecraft can do, i.e. the Pico region. I sincerely hope we have a map this cool next revision and onward! Thanks again Thrawn!

I think I've covered everything. If not I'll post here. I really hope you all benefit from my hard work. Let me know if there is anything else I can do. If people find this helpful I plan on continuing this work for as many revisions I play on this server. Just let me know! Current version, PvE Rev 11 Version 1.0.

1358735484.0,44,self.mcpublic,16yqjk,Tips on making Minecraft run better,56,12,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/16yqjk/tips_on_making_minecraft_run_better/,"Throughout my 3-4 months on the server, I have noticed that a lot of people complain about low FPS (Frames Per Second). I wanted to take a moment and help those players out. 
    
First off, I should explain my specs:
    
    Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium
    6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601
    HP Pavillion dv6 Notebook PC
    64-bit
    Intel Core i5 @ 2.5GHz, 2 Cores, 4 Logical Processors
    8 GB RAM
    
So I'm not running on an alienware computer, but then again, it's not a crappy laptop either. I get around [30 fps](http://i.imgur.com/l1hT1wc.png) when I have a clean install of minecraft. After applying these changes I can get [170 fps](http://i.imgur.com/XdmFRgH.png).
    
When applying these settings, test your Minecraft before going on to the next tip. That way if your computer has an adverse you can easily revert your changes. Please remember that these do not work for all computers it all depends on a lot of things.
    
**Task Manager:**
    
To open task manager, hit CTRL + SHIFT + ESC. Navigate to the Processes tab.
    
Notice how you have some processes running without the actual program running? Sometimes programs like Chrome, iTunes, and Quicktime always have a process running that doesn't need to be. **Don't just shut down random processes!** Head on over to [ProcessLibrary.com](http://www.processlibrary.com/directory/a/1/) and type that process exe name into the search. This amazing resource will then tell you if the process is a okay to stop, not okay, or even if it's safe or not. Go through and end the processes that you don't need running. The processes ""dwm.exe"", ""explorer.exe"", and ""winlogon.exe"" should never be ended. Your cat will die if you end it.
    
Open Minecraft and log in. Then go back to your Task Manager Processes tab. You should see the process ""javaw.exe"". Right click it and set the priority to ""High"".
    
**Java**
    
Make sure you have the most current and correct version of running on your device. To check which version you have, open CMD and run the command ""java -version"". You should get something like this:
    
    64 bit output: 
    java version ""1.7.0_10""
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_10-b18)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.6-b04, mixed mode)
    
    32 bit output:
    java version ""1.7.0_11""
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_11-b21)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 23.6-b04, mixed mode, sharing)
    

Next, check if you are running a 32 or 64 bit operating system. Hit Win + R and type ""dxdiag.exe"". Click ""OK"". An alert may pop up saying that it may have to access the internet. This is normal. Navigate to the System tab under Operating System it will either say 64 or 32 bit as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/71Dw7LB.png).
    
If you have a 32 bit OS you should get the 32 bit output as seen above. If that is the case, skip to the next section.
   
For 64 bit computers only:
    
If you are running only the 32 bit Java on a 64 bit OS, you are going to lose 40 fps or more. To check and see if you have both and are installed correctly, open your 32 bit internet browser and go to the [Java checker](http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp) and follow the instructions. Then open up Minecraft and log in. Open your Task Manager with CTRL + SHIFT + ESC and under the Processes tab right click on javaw.exe and go to properties. If you are running 64 bit java for Minecraft it should read ""C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin"" under the location.
    
If minecraft is running java out of \Program Files (x86)\ you are using 32 bit java for Minecraft and should do the following
     
* [Download and install](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) both Java JRE for 32 and 64 bits. 64 should install to c:/program files and 32 to c:/program files (x86)
* Go to your path variables by typing ""system path variables"" into your start search. The first option is ""Edit the system environment variables""
* Open that up and go to the advanced tab. Click on ""Environment Variables...""
* Under the bottom half of that window is the System variables. Scroll down to Path and select it. Click edit.
* Make sure that both bin directories are in there. It should look something like this on the end of the current variable value. 
    
    ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin;
    
* Hit OK for each of the three screens open
    
To verify that everything is working correctly, again, open your 32 bit internet browser and go to the [Java checker](http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp) and follow the instructions. It should say that you are good to go. If not, go to Google and do some research. Open up Minecraft and log in. Open your Task Manager with CTRL + SHIFT + ESC and under the Processes tab right click on javaw.exe and go to properties. If you are running 64 bit java for minecraft it should read ""C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin"" under the location.
    
**Allocating more RAM to Minecraft**
    
Here is a great [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QttgiVI97R0) that explains why allocating more ram is important and how to do it. Please note that allocating more ram **may** make you have lower fps. Test it out and see first. To see how much RAM you have in the first place hit Win + R and type ""dxdiag.exe"" again. Click ""OK"". Under Memory is the amount of RAM you have. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/71Dw7LB.png)
    
I wouldn't set the max heap to 100% of physical RAM, because the OS will start thrashing if it gets to that size.
You can use the 'g' suffix to indicate gigabytes. For example, -Xmx4g would tell Java that it can use up to 4gb.
    
If you're running a 32-bit system, the max useful number for the -Xmx parameter is -Xmx1024m
Default sizes are system-dependent and determined at runtime. Don't just plug things into the command line and expect instant results. Do reasonably good experiments and track your results. 
    
**Allocate more RAM to Java**
    
~~Open your Control Panel and click Java. Select the Java tab and click view. Under Runtime Parameters there will probably be a blank field. Enter in ""-Xmx**RAM**m"" with **RAM** being the amount of ram you have. Refer to dxdiag.exe to find the number that you should use. Here is my [dxdiag](http://i.imgur.com/71Dw7LB.png), and here is my [Runtime Params](http://i.imgur.com/0bN9AK5.png)~~ People said not to do this... I have and don't see a problem with it.

    
**Optifine**
    
Check out the minecraftforum.net post for [optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-b4-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/). Follow all the instructions on there and remember to **back up** your .minecraft folder so you can revert back. Just copy and paste it to your desktop. If you don't download correctly or something kills Minecraft, just move that original file back to your appdata/roaming/ folder.

[Here](http://pastebin.com/fp6hQ3Qs) are the settings that I have for optifine. Under video settings, set your Performance to MaxFPS. You can also search on Google for the best settings for Optifine. 
    
**Magic Launcher**
    
""One thing I would add is (if possible) for people to use the [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-launcher-magic-launcher-100-mods-options-news/): it makes it very convenient for installing multiple mods (it makes it so much easier for me to upgrade REIS mini map + optifine) when there's an update, you can configure how much ram to allocate to Minecraft through the magic launcher as well."" -ne0codex
    
I don't know how this program works with my other fixes as I have not tested it. Magic Launcher has a setting for adjusting the amount of allocated RAM, so I don't think you should do that section. I don't know though as I am not familiar with Magic Launcher.

**Computer management**
    
If you have a lot of files on your computer, it could be making it run slower. Open Disk Cleanup. This can be found by hitting Win + R and typing ""cleanmgr.exe"". Click ""OK"". Select all the the boxes *Check your Recycle Bin for any files that you may have deleted by accident.* Then click ""OK"" and ""Delete files"".
    
Open your temp folder by hitting Win + R and typing %temp% and clicking ""OK"". Go ahead select all the files and delete them. Skip over files that are being used by another program.

Lastly, run your Disk Defragmenter. Hit Win + R and type ""dfrgui.exe"". Click ""OK"". Select your C drive and click ""Defragment disk"" Let the process run until it is done. The program will make multiple passes to make sure everything is defragmented. 
    
Laptops: In your power settings make sure it is set to Max Performance and not balanced or power saver
    
Also try running Minecraft in fullscreen mode. ne0codex suggested it and I did get about 10 more fps when I tried it. 
    
.
    
Let me know if you have any questions. That is a bit longer that I thought it would be. Please remember that I am not reliable for any loss of data, your computer exploding, or your cat running away.

1343251794.0,45,self.mcpublic,x5j52,[Announcement] All servers will be resetting for 1.3 - details inside!,53,8,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/x5j52/announcement_all_servers_will_be_resetting_for_13/,"Hey guys - you've probably heard some of this in [bits](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/w6li3/ok_pve_its_time_to_start_planning_for_the_next/) and [pieces](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/vw3cy/survival_has_reset/) already, but it's time for the proper announcement!

**We will be resetting all three of our servers - c.nerd.nu, p.nerd.nu, and s.nerd.nu - when 1.3 is released.** This means that when the 1.3 patch is released, the current revision for all three servers will immediately end. A new revision will begin on each server once all of our servers and plugins are updated.

I'm sure there will be a lot of questions related to this announcement - we'll address the main questions below, and try to answer any remaining questions in the comments.

----

**The servers reset when 1.3 is released - but when will 1.3 be released?** It's up to Mojang, but the announced 1.3 launch date is a week from today, **Wednesday, August 1st.**

**What is the status of the current revision?** The current revisions are all still alive and running. *All rules (such as no griefing) continue to apply.* After the servers are reset, backups of the current revisions will be made available at nerd.nu/backups. Use the remaining time before 1.3 to wrap up your projects!

**What is a reset?** We take down the current map and replace it with an entirely new one. The replacement map for each server will be completely new terrain, with a new spawn. Everyone starts fresh: empty inventory, no builds, nothing is carried over.

**Will the new revisions launch the moment 1.3 comes out?** No - we can't launch our new revisions until CraftBukkit and all of our plugins are updated. This could be hours or it could be days, but it is expected to take a bit longer than usual this go-round. Once everything is ready, we will launch each new revision one at a time - don't worry, we'll announce everything as it happens.

**So what happens while we wait for the new revisions?** Once 1.3 is launched, but before the new revisions are ready, **we will be hosting a temporary 1.3 chaos map on c.nerd.nu**. Note that this temp server is volatile, and may be occasionally reset, though stability should improve as we get more familiar with 1.3 over time.  Join the chaos and explore 1.3 with your friends!

**Will we be able to use (insert 1.3 feature here) on the servers??** We won't know for sure exactly what 1.3 looks like until it launches, so no promises on what will or won't be included. We will do what we can to make sure as many of the new 1.3 features as possible are available.

**Give me more details about the new (C, P, S) revision!** The server admins will provide more details on each server's new revision in the coming days.

----

Thanks, and we hope you're looking forward to 1.3 and the new revisions as much as we are!",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_x5j52,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/x5j52/announcement_all_servers_will_be_resetting_for_13/,moderator

You can see it in action for PvE here: [http://minecanary.com/#/u/p.nerd.nu](http://minecanary.com/#/u/p.nerd.nu).

It does two things: lets you know how much time has elapsed since the last crash/restart (protip: restarts are roughly every 2 hours) and lets you see the player count without having to constantly spam the refresh button in Minecraft.

The actual server contact is limited to the single server list ping packet, so this shouldn't put any strain on the server (actually, if many players use this instead of spamming their refresh buttons, this should *reduce* the packet traffic).

This should work for any Nerd.Nu Minecraft server (see [http://minecanary.com/#/u/c.nerd.nu](http://minecanary.com/#/u/c.nerd.nu), [http://minecanary.com/#/u/s.nerd.nu](http://minecanary.com/#/u/s.nerd.nu)) as well as any other server -- though the Nerd servers are the only ones that I have set to update every minute even if nobody's looking to keep the last-down time accurate.

[edit] Another protip: in case it's not obvious, you can hover over the humanized time (such as ""about 2 hours ago"") to see the exact time.

[edit] Yet another protip: again in case it's not obvious, the bar turns orange-yellow if the server is mostly full.

[another edit] If you want to see historical data, forty_two has some great graphs: [http://forty-two.nu/mcpublicstatus/](http://forty-two.nu/mcpublicstatus/).  I'm not sure how frequently his checks, and also it doesn't concretely display the time of the last crash/restart, which is why I created MineCanary (MineCanary also has a cool player-meter and works for any server).  Ideally you can use the two tools together in harmony :D

This is still a very new and hacked-together tool, so let me know if you have problems with it.

I'm working on making it better visually as well, but the priority was to get it working reliably first.",,False,,t5_2s52h,1338253452.0,,,True,t3_u98z5,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/u98z5/tired_of_endlessly_refreshing_to_see_when_the/,
1333812298.0,45,self.mcpublic,rxx14,[PvE] Ultimate Lottery!,59,14,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/rxx14/pve_ultimate_lottery/,"[So today, I realized that I have way too many diamonds...&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;](http://imgur.com/lQNR3)

So, in order to make people happy because I brag about it too much, I'm going to do a lottery for you. The prize: A whole stack of diamonds.

How the lottery works will be like this: I've built a redstone game in Melonville where people guess which grass block will survive under stone for the longest time possible (The death of each block is detected by a BUD and indicated by the turning off of a redstone torch). There are five grass blocks overall.

The blocks are number 1-5 from left to right. Since the order of the deaths are completely random, I realized that the order is a random number which could be used as a selection in a lottery.

**Rules:**

Each person gets two picks. This is what you do: Get the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and create a number out of them. The same number cannot be repeated twice. Legitimate numbers include 15324, 42135, while 22514 and 33333 are not. There are 120 possible combinations overall, so if 60 people compete, there will be no more numbers left. Leave a comment in this post stating the numbers you choose, your in-game name, ~~your PIN number~~, and the coords to your base if you want me to trek a long way and deliver the diamonds to you.

ENTRIES ARE FREE, NO NEED TO PAY ME ANYTHING.

**ENTRIES CLOSE AT 11:59PM, MONDAY, APRIL 9TH, 2011, AUSTRALIAN EASTERN STANDARD TIME (MELBOURNE). This is Monday 8:59am US Central Time, Monday 1:59pm GMT, Monday 7:29pm in Calcutta. I'm not responsible for anything if you can't convert time zones. Use a tool online or something.**

This lottery is only available to players who actually play on PvE. I'm not giving you 64 diamonds on Survival.

To make it fair: If nobody wins the lottery, I will keep playing my game until a winner comes up.

No two players can select the same number twice. :)

One of the fancy new features that I have put into the system is for users to be able to see their own open requests.  So after you have made a request, you are able to /check to see a list of requests that you currently have open.


If you no longer require a request to be completed, instead of sending another one saying ""I don't need this anymore"", you can simply close your request by typing /done &lt;id of the request&gt;


eg:  if you do /check, would will see something like
#1. [OPEN] Mar.14@19.43.54 by Deaygo - can you make this water flow?
#2. [OPEN] Mar.14@20.00.00 by Deaygo - I found some grief

If you don't want the water to flow anymore you can type /done 1 and that will tell the mods that you don't need that request anymore.

The time has come to reset the PVE map. This second map has had an excellent run, starting out *very* rough and sudden. But, the PVE users rallied and turned it into an *amazing* server to play on. We have the best record of all the nerd.nu servers for map longevity, but it's time to move on. This is not a sudden decision. We've been talking about it internally for some time. We've listened to the general chatter in-game, on mumble, and IRC to gauge whether this is the right decision, and we feel it is.

I know this announcement will be met with a spectrum of reactions. Some of you are in the middle of new projects and it seems heartless of us to reset the map right in the middle of that. Some of you stopped playing weeks ago and have been ready for a map reset for some time now. The unfortunate truth is there's never a good time to reset the map. For those of you who are just starting new projects, I *totally* understand how you feel. When I first started playing on the Creative server last year, I was well into a huge, brand new project when a map reset was announced, so believe me, I do understand.

But, while it's hard to believe looking at the cartograph, the server is actually getting crowded. The number of land disputes has risen sharply just as one indication of that fact.

Not long after the reset, both PVE maps (the first and second maps) will be available for download. If you plan to build locally, though, you will want to make sure lava flow and fire spread are turned *off*. Otherwise, your world will burn. [(Spawn would look like this.)](http://imgur.com/a/VPhFT)

I will be happy to answer questions on why's and wherefor's of the reset in the comments, but now it's time to look forward.



**WHAT TO DO DURING THE NEXT WEEK**

Starting immediately, what we'd love to see is all the users documenting the astounding and amazing creations on the current map. Post your creations on [/r/Minecraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft)! Post them on [the wiki](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Main_Page)! Let's get this map remembered! Not only will we get more people wanting to come see your stuff and build on the server, but it will give ideas for future players!

Take screenshots! Shoot video! Document as much as you can and get it posted for people to see! Some people on the other nerd.nu servers have *never* been to PVE. Let them see what they've been missing.



**WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THE NEW MAP**

Believe it or not, setting up the new map has been actually underway for some time. Here's a brief summary of some of the changes you will see in the new map:

* An even more ""epic"" landscape, though not as ""epic"" as the first map.
* Plumped ores, though not to the ridiculous levels like the first map, and a few modifications.
* Iron now reaches all the way up to level 76, instead of just 64. This means all the mountains will actually have iron in them, not just coal.
* Redstone veins have been reduced slightly. Its use is limited in SMP and the amount available will easily faciliate the needs for interesting projects, boosters, etc.
* Gold has been increased ever so slightly to accomodate the increased need for gold in boosters.
* Flowers, pumpkins, and mushrooms are more plentiful.
* Higher trade rates. The current rate is 3 diamonds per nether block. The new rate will be 4 diamonds per nether block. (The rate on the first map was 5 diamonds per nether block.) The rates reflect the relative ore plumping.
* More mobs. This is a side-effect of the more epic landscape. It won't be as bad as the first map, but just be forewarned that the ""versus environment"" part of PVE will be a step higher on the new map. Take it as a challenge. :)
* Lava flow will be back on.



**THE PLAN**

Exact details are still being worked out with the tech admins, but the basic plan is to take the map offline about a week from today. Then the new map will be copied over. Then it's a short matter of creating the required protections, testing the plugins, and then opening up the server to the users.



**GET STARTED!**

Please! Go take screenshots, go shoot video! Let's get this current map immortalized for the awesomeness that it is. Show off your stuff to everyone! I occasionally see some really amazing stuff posted to /r/Minecraft, but honestly, I'm way more impressed with what I see *every day* on the PVE server.

it's ready
for you to come


&gt;and stay.

-----

The 17th s.nerd.nu map will go live at roughly the same time as p.nerd.nu's new map.

Some notable changes:

- 4 portals on the roads.
- 6 warp signs at spawn, with 2 in the wilderness.
- you can exit spawn via drop - you don't have to use the warps if you don't want to.
- significantly expanded protections around warp &amp; portal points.
- ice strips on the center of every road for faster travel and interesting jousting.
- warps are now at each 500,500 point, meaning roads are longer - allowing more room for bases along the roads
- the server is now on HARD difficulty (you can starve to death and zombies can break down wooden doors, as well as other small increases in difficulty)

As usual: any problems with protections or the map need to be swiftly reported to an admin and we'll take care of it!

I can't wait to see you all there &amp; see what you've all got planned for this revision!

Sometime last night one of our drives became full, and as such the servers started to have issues and caused some corruption.  Some time in the last month our backup script stopped working and had gone unnoticed.  I would also like to apologize for that, it seems that we have a terrible track record with this.  We were doing well, we have probably 300-400 GB of backups from the last month or so, it just so happened that we didn't notice that the script had stopped running.

&amp;nbsp;

As a result of all of this, there is some map corruption on PvE that we are working on resolving.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/utTQneN.png) you can see some of the damage corruption that has occurred.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/gK8eJo4.png) is what it previously looked like.  What we are going to do is revert the region that was corrupted, and following that we will be replaying the logblock log to try to bring back as much as we can.  Again I would like to apologize on the behalf of the Reddit Public staff for this incident and we work as quickly as we can to get this resolved.

&amp;nbsp;

**Note**: if there are any issues you can get in contact with a PvE Admin and they will do what they can to assist you.

I don't play as much on roastnewt anymore, I just used it to do modreqs while bored and ban obvious xrayers and spammers.  

I didn't play on roastnewt because I was tired of dealing with users saying ""You can't base camp me, you're a mod,"" or ""You teleported to me in modmode to find my secret base,"" or ""That lava room was obviously made with spawned lava.""  And drama like that.  So I play on FatherSouth.

But only playing on your mod account to do modreqs is apparently not enough to just let you play the game.  From other mods complaining about you to higher staff because you're ""too mean, if he's a mod he should be nicer to people,"" to making up rules to try to get you in trouble (like these nonexistant rules:  No fighting in spawn, no making a trap to catch a combatlogger even if you clean it up after it kills them, no using enderpearls to pass through floors, no changing your mumble name).

So anyways, I'm stepping down so I don't have to deal with it.  Its not worth the ""privilege"" of working for the server for free to have to deal with being scolded like a child over things that aren't against the rules.

1349056162.0,44,self.mcpublic,10qmqy,PvE Proposal: Joint building with Japanese students,48,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/10qmqy/pve_proposal_joint_building_with_japanese_students/,"Hi all,

I am an English lecturer in Japan and am running a special course on learning English with video games. The game we have chosen is minecraft and as a part of their assessment, I am considering letting them loose on an English speaking minecraft server with the explicit instructions to build a structure with a native English speaker. Being a keen redditor (and the admin on this English for foreign speakers rage comics [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/EFLcomics/) ) I thought it might be a good idea to enlist the help of fellow redditors to help me out. 

What I am thinking of (at this point in time) is to bring in my students (approx 8) in January, and have them introduce themselves, meet some of the regulars on the PvE server, get a feel for the layout of the server, and then possibly buddy up with a native speaker and build a pre-determined structure as a means to test their ability to communicate in English. The first non-native/native pair to complete the structure, being declared the *winners* (I use the term loosely here).

If any of you might be up for something like that, let me know.

* Spawn has a portal at 0, 0. All other portals are **random**, though there is at least one in each quadrant of the map.

* **None** of the map is vanilla, but there are many places that are very similar to vanilla.

* The center circle of the map features custom **built** mountains and other landforms. This means I placed every ridge and whorl in the land.

* The four corners feature custom **genned** landscape. This means I determined generally how the land will look, but not the placement  of each and every lake and valley.

* There is mild plumping over **all** of the map. I varied the ore plumped by biome:

&gt; Deserts: Gold and Lapis

&gt; Extreme Hills: Redstone

&gt; Jungle: Iron and Coal

&gt; Ocean: Lapis

&gt; Plains: Iron and Gold

&gt; Swamp: Clay

&gt; Taiga: Redstone and Gold

Diamonds are not plumped anywhere.

* Glowstone will be able to be found underground all over the map, with slightly higher frequency in the terrain control land.

* To compensate for the raised land level, ore heights have also been brought up in the tc lands. 

Also please remember that there are 4,096,000,000 blocks on this map, and only one of me. I've worked real hard to make sure that everything looks good, but there may still be things I've missed. **If you find something that looks out of place, please make a /modreq with [thrawn] at the beginning**, and I'll come have a look. 

Two things I know for sure might be interesting are the deserts and the villages. I can confidently say that no map *in the history of Minecraft* has been built the way I did this one, and it did some [straaaange things](http://imgur.com/a/ZliGh) to the villages. I leave it up to the players if they wish to inhabit or renovate some of these kooky by-products of experimental map design. 

As for the deserts, terrain control took my planned seed and turned all the deserts into something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jCbGNA7.png). In order to give you guys proper (non-fractured) deserts, I used world painter to fix the biomes, but that produces the dreaded one-block deep sand on top of stone. I flew up and down every  desert on the map repeating //replacenear to fix this, but I can't say for certain that I got every single spot.

As you may have seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/19ukum/the_redstone_update_15_will_be_released_on/), on [r/minecraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/19uepn/minecraft_redstone_update_prerelease/), or elsewhere, the 1.5 [Redstone Update](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Update) patch will be going live next Wednesday, on [March 13th](http://mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-redstone-update-pre-release/). With that in mind, it's time for us to announce our plans for the patch! In particular:

* **p.nerd.nu** (P) and **s.nerd.nu** (S) will be **ending their current revisions** when the 1.5 patch comes out, and will be **resetting to new revisions** when our servers and plugins are updated to 1.5.
* **c.nerd.nu** (C) will be **staying on its current revision** through the update to 1.5 - **no reset planned**.
* As has become tradition, we will have a **temporary 1.5 chaos server** running at chaos.nerd.nu ASAP after the patch is released, and until we're ready to bring back up S and P on new revs.

I'll leave it to the server admins to announce their plans for the new revs (and the end of the current ones) - I will just say that we have some really exciting changes in store for the community :)

----

Now, some **Frequently Asked Questions!**

* **So what happens when the patch comes out?** We'll end the current revisions of P and S, and take down those servers (the current revisions will keep going until the patch comes out). We'll put up a temp chaos server, running the new 1.5 patch, at chaos.nerd.nu. C will stay exactly as is, running 1.4 - so hang on to your current .jars so you can keep playing there.

* **How long will it take to update the servers?** It depends. We have to wait for new versions of Bukkit and our external plugins to come out, and our techs will need to update our internal plugins, too. This may take a few days, or a week or more. We'll make sure to keep you guys updated (usually by posting a spreadsheet showing our progress).

* **Okay, so what happens when you're updated?** We'll announce start times for new P and S revisions, then launch them. We'll also update C to run on 1.5 (but still using the current map). We may or may not keep the chaos map running, depending on the load on the other servers.

* **What does a server reset mean?** It means we wipe the map, and everyone starts fresh - a brand-new world to build and explore in, no builds or inventory are carried over. Use it as an opportunity to try something new, build/fight with a new group, or get to work on that dream project of yours.

* **What if I want to keep building on the current rev?** We always put up copies of retired revisions up for download at [nerd.nu/backups](http://nerd.nu/backups), so you can use it in single-player or on your own server. (For example, we posted the most recent S rev #19 this week.)

* **Will we get to use (insert 1.5 feature here) on the servers?** We can't say for sure yet - we'll have to see what the patch looks like when the final version comes out, and how our plugins interact with it. We generally try to default to allowing new stuff, unless it totally breaks the server/gameplay. (For example, it may take us a while to figure out how to get hoppers/droppers to play nice with LWC.)

* **It's a Redstone Update - can we do a redstone building contest??** YES! Still figuring out when and where would be the best place to do it, but...it's gonna happen.

----

**TL;DR** new S and P revs for 1.5, not for C; 1.5 temp chaos in the interim

Tame a horse, lay down some carpets, run away from zombies with reinforcements, we have it all (well, with the changes described below) - so join up at p.nerd.nu for 1.6.2 fun today!**

**There is an additional feature added on P that was not mentioned in the original post below: Riderless tamed horses are now invincible!  That said, we do not recommend keeping your riderless tamed horse in a pool of lava.**

***
Thirty-four days ago, Mojang officially released the Horse Update to Minecraft.  With it brought nametags, carpets, new variants of clay, and of course a new mob, the eponymous tameable furry quadrupeds.

Thirty-four days later, we at p.nerd.nu are still running the now-slightly-out-of-date version 1.5.2 of this marvelous game.  Why the delay, you may ask, especially since the new update is already running on chaotic S?  Well, for most of the time since 1.6.2 was updated, we were waiting on plugins.  Once those were done, there were some issues presented by the new content (mostly related to horses) that we wanted to sort out before the server update, the solutions to which can be found below.  With that now done, and with an update time set with the techs, we are pleased to announce that **p.nerd.nu will update to 1.6.2 at approximately Tuesday 9 PM EDT ([click here](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20130806T21&amp;p1=179) to see this in your time zone).**  In the meantime, if you seek golden apples or glistering melons, you may want to stock up on them now before their crafting recipes become more expensive in a few days!

**This is not a new rev; rather, we are simply updating the current map (rev 11) to Minecraft version 1.6.2.**  We are looking at a reset eventually, but that will be [further down the line](http://redd.it/1j2pae); we will announce more details on the reset as we confirm them.

For this new PvE update, we have made some changes related to horses and nametags; read on for more details!

**Horses:**

We will be seeding horses pseudo-randomly across the map for players to find and tame.  **Horse accessibility will initially be restricted as wolves and ocelots are; that is, only the tamer of the horse will be able to ride it.  If you wish to open riding permissions to other players, however, use /unlock-horse and right-click on your horse, and anyone will be able to ride it.  To undo this and restrict riding permissions to only you again, use /lock-horse and right-click on your horse.**

Since this was generated on 1.5.2, the current map did not spawn with horse armor, so **for this rev only we are implementing [these crafting recipes](http://i.imgur.com/FbdotcV.png) for horse armor.**  We reserve the right to change or remove this for the next rev (which, when generated, will actually have horse armor on the map), but for now, enjoy these recipes and keep your horses safe!

Also for this rev only, a [crafting recipe for saddles (scroll down a bit)](http://i.imgur.com/FbdotcV.png) will be implemented.

**Nametags:**

None of the dungeons on this map contain nametags, so again **for this rev only, we are implementing [this crafting recipe (scroll down a bit)](http://i.imgur.com/FbdotcV.png) for nametags.**  If you've ever wanted to see what it's like to keep around a mob named Grumm or Dinnerbone in regular PvE gameplay, now's your chance to try it out!  Same goes if you want to keep around a mob not named Grumm or Dinnerbone, though we take no responsibility for any less-than-dramatic results that occur.

Please note that your names must comply with P chat rules (including but not limited to: no homophobia, racism, or any other form of hate speech), and we reserve the right to remove or rename any mob that does not.

That's it!  Apologies again for the long delay in updating to 1.6.2, and as always, feel free to comment below or come to us about any questions, comments, concerns you have about this update.  Also, watch the subreddit for news of a PvE feedback thread where we seek your input on everything PvE, including the update changes we will be implementing for the rest of this rev.",PvE,False,,t5_2s52h,1375846953.0,pve,,True,t3_1jpop6,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1jpop6/162_coming_to_a_pve_rev_near_you/,moderator

Hellooooo everybody!

With map preparation finalised, and with our update to 1.6.2 accomplished safe and sound, we're finally able to set a proper date we can launch Revision 22 by. This time and date (seen above) is pretty much as secure as it can be, the only thing that might delay or hold us back is one of the admins falling ill or otherwise being unable to make it unexpectedly. If something comes up we'll let you know as soon as possible, but we're not waiting on anything in particular to get this revision up and running.

However, we are announcing this a week in advance for a couple of reasons. One being that we're done with map preparation and we would like to make that known, another being that a weekend works best all around for map launches, and it would have been an unfair amount of short notice to spring the new revision on you *this* weekend.

Chaos events will be ongoing on s.nerd.nu until then, and we're looking to bring in a more reasonable config for Enchantism in the upcoming round, so keep an eye out for the post for round 7 when we have more concrete plans for when we'll be available to set that up. Have a [complimentary chaos puppy](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbd8tvlE7m1rcyxhzo3_250.gif) in the mean time :)

----
**General details about the upcoming revision**

----
- Map size will be the standard **4000x4000** (i.e. from -2000 to +2000 on both the X and Z axes)
- We're running with the **four cardinal roads** this map, with portals located at the **300** and **800** block marks down each road. There are also four 'hidden' nether portals further out up for discovery.
- Roads are protected up to **25 blocks** above and on average **5 blocks** below their surface. Roads are protected much further down in the ocean biome(s), check those out when you get a chance. If you want to build in the space above the road between yourself and a neighbour, **you must have their consent** before doing so. We'll also monitor any builds that take up large portions of the road and contact anyone we feel is taking their claims with these a bit too far. Portal zones are protected up to **sky limit**, but only around **6 blocks** below their surface. Similarly, we'll monitor any cases where it seems people might be abusing the protections offered by these areas.

----
**Changes being brought in with the new revision**

----
- **Enchantism** - Currently setup and working perfectly fine on the chaos events, we'll be going ahead with this for the new revision with the aforementioned updated config (accounting for any suggested further changes, of course).
- **PvPTimer** - We'll hold off on bringing this on board until at least a few days after the map launch, to ensure things are as dangerous as ever in those early couple of days. However, once it's in effect, players who have first joined the server will have (an optional, they can turn it off if they choose) **1 hour** of gameplay free from PvP. PvPTimer also comes with an option for protection upon respawn - we'll be keeping this as well unless there's any serious concern with it.
- **Rebalance Villagers** has apparently been facing some issues. Per totemo, ""*RebalanceVillagers is not building because their repository for downloading dependencies has been down for many days at this stage.  I'll try to work around it when I have a  moment.*"" It seems to be mostly out of our hands, but if we can't get this ready prior to map launch, we'll progress with vanilla-style villagers.
- Crafting recipes for horse armour and saddles should hopefully be available upon map launch, if not shortly after. We'll let you know what these are when we've come to an agreement on them.
- **Creeper spawners** - An idea suggested a short while ago, we've gone ahead with putting a few of these around the map. Being that abandoned mineshafts are much more easy to locate than individual mob spawners, what i've done is replaced a number of **cave spider spawners** across the map with ones that will spawn creepers. These are spread out randomly across the map, and i've tried to ensure a reasonable distribution in each of the four quadrants of the map. I can't guarantee which abandoned mineshafts out of all of them will be discovered, so the numbers i've replaced are done with that in mind.
- We've dropped the 5 minute timer on despawning carts, however this change was made following putting the map up on event.nerd.nu. I've repopulated a number of abandoned mineshafts within the proximity of spawn with physical chests (all with sweet loot) to account for the chest minecarts that were lost, and hopefully those further out into the map should be unaffected.

----
**Things that aren't changing/will carry over into the new revision**

----
- Your clan chat should still work fine from the previous revision, i've noted that these have persisted throughout the chaos events.
- Books will still only require 3 paper to be crafted.
- PlumpXP will still be in effect, continuing an experience plump of 8X the vanilla amount (correct me if this is wrong, couldn't find the appropriate subreddit post for this).
- Armoured head drops will continue to be in effect.
- Any additional changes similar to this can be found listed on the **second floor** of the spawn building.


----
**Some pointers for the first day of the revision**

----
- To combat the concerns of a complicated spawn setup whilst maintaining that we do need the additional floors to hold information relevant to newer players, there is a warp sign directly off the respawn podium for each of the roads that will teleport you down two floors right before the drop. Roughly about a week after we've settled into this new revision, we will update the signs so that the warp takes you down to *below* the drop, and into the PvP-enabled zone. This is to make sure that people using the warp signs aren't given a massive advantage on the first day over those that prefer to walk their way down, as well as to give a second chance to those that might have accidentally clicked the sign.
- **Land claims** - Bolded because it's a hassle *every* revision, land claims are by far the biggest issue we have to deal with as staff on the first day of the new map. These are many, and they are often complicated and require upwards of 30 minutes of our time to dedicate to, so please, in the interest of freeing up the workload for us and making things easier on everyone involved - **talk to the person you're contesting the land claim with first** and see if you can't come to a resolution between yourselves. Getting a moderator involved often means we'll check the LogBlock timestamps of whoever placed what first, and more often than not all we'll end up doing is separating your claims down the middle if they overlap. Please try to be reasonable with one another if you end up having claim issues, and please make a modreq rather than personally message a moderator if you need it to be resolved on your behalf. Modreqs go into a queue, and we handle them in the order they come in.

Hopefully i've covered what needs to be said about this upcoming revision, and please, if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask! I'm incredibly forgetful at the best of times, so chances are i've forgotten something completely obvious. Some additional interesting ideas about changes have been thrown about behind the scenes in the past couple of days that we could consider bringing onto Survival with this upcoming revision, but i've held off from mentioning them until there's anything concrete there. I'll be keeping everyone up to date with any further changes, both here and on the forums!

Wanted to give everyone an update on where we stand with the servers and our plans to launch new revisions of S and P.

First off, wanted to provide some context for all the downtime last week. Basically, the servers were getting attacked, and in an effort for the datacenter to preserve uninterrupted services for other users, our servers had to be taken offline for a period of time. During this time, the servers were coming up and going down fairly often, as you probably noticed. As it was a pretty unstable situation, we didn't want to post that things were back up until we were sure things had stabilized again.

That is now the case, and everything should be back to normal for the near future. Thanks for your patience as we sorted those issues out. :)

A side effect of the downtime is that it slowed our progress a bit in getting everything updated for 1.5. Regardless, anyone who's looked at our [progress spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah6wg6DGNNqwdEcxMjlhRTk4MHdGZk5vNElKNy05UEE&amp;usp=sharing) can tell that we're quite close. As such, we wanted to let you know that **we are targeting a launch of both p.nerd.nu and s.nerd.nu for early this coming weekend** (April 5-6).

This timeframe is still subject to change, as we simply can't guarantee that everything we need will be in working order by then. For example, Bukkit has yet to release a beta/recommended build, which is not ideal, and as of this morning some of the external plugins we rely on for P and S are still definitely broken. But we'll be aiming for a weekend launch throughout this week, determining whether everything is sufficiently working to proceed.

Thanks for being a part of our community, and hope to see you either on C or on the new S and P revs!

**tl;dr** servers stable again, aiming for P/S launch this coming weekend

I would like to thank some specific people as well as the community itself. (Sorry it’s so long)*


Ever since I first joined MCPublic early of Rev 13. (Feb 2011) It was my first time on a public server. I have had the pleasure to meet some fantastic people on the servers. Sure, MCPublic, as a whole was a great pleasure for me. In fact, you guys have helped me overcome some serious life challenge that I have suffered through. Up until I joined the servers, I had never had “real” friends before, you guys were so welcoming and caring about me and welcomed me in open arms. I never felt any since or fear of intimidation from anyone. One of my first friends was Marting11. When I was a MC noob he helped me with my shitty redstone contraption I tried to make. After he was finished he showed me around the map. Taking the CTA rails around the server was amazing. To see these magnificent works of art you guys built.

Since then, I have been playing on these servers with other fantastic people for years now, and I would like to personally thank them for everything


* Verros- From The Netherbox to Dome5 to The Big Ignuf, you have (in my opinion) brought the Creative server community together. Actually, digging Dome5 gave me chances to meet some of the great friends I have now. (Skylord_Char, JernAdams1735, imwoood etc.) And for that I thank you for bring me and the server as a community together through the numerous community events you have hosted in the past, and I hope there are many more to come.


* Skylord_Char- Oh god, where do I even start with you? We never really hung out that much until the start of the excavation of Dome5, when I think it was you who first convinced me to join mumble. I was so scared, I had never really talked to someone else online before. But when I first heard you and your English accent and just general goofiness, you just put those fears away. Since then, you have been a remarkable not only friend, but mentor to me weather you knew that or not. Mentor, when my home exploded in May of last year. I had nothing. I was devastated. Hopefully you remember this but I went on mumble later the week of the incident and was so freaked but you talked me down, and actually gave me a few laughs in a time where laughs were pretty much all I had.

Today, you have been the best friend to me. We always see things eye to eye with each other and we can have a serious conversation than switch to something completely off topic and then have some good laughs. I struggled through school last year and was actually quite depressed after everything. But through all of that every time I talk to you, you always have that british cheer amongst you. And no matter what was plaguing me I forgot about it and had a great time.  


* John(*Jern*)Adams1735- Damn. From the first time you joined and helped me build my shitty little town, you were so nice to me and helpful with the city. (Haha you were so excited when I made you Co-Mayor :D) To go from Mod to Server Admin to Head Admin in a span of only about 6 months. Just damn. But there was obviously no doubt why you climbed the ladder so quickly. And no doubt you would make an amazing Head Admin, and server mom as well. 

From the beginning, when you first joined, you were always out looking for someone who needed help. Wether it be with making a town or just someone who got griefed and didn’t know what to do. Or with EVERY community project, you were always happy to help. Now, as a head admin, you have the get done attitude while still holding onto the personal aspect of server life, you always seem so approachable about whatever needs talking about. Which, really, was not always fair I went to you about everything. But no matter what it was, you listened, and you took appropriate action. I haven’t always been fair to you in the past, but that’s because you were someone I could really talk to about everything, no matter how big or small.


* To all past and present staff- Im going to be very blunt here. **THANK YOU** for putting up with this shit for as long as you have. To sacrifice your time and energy into something that your not being payed to do, just to volunteer, wow. Whenever I had a modreq that needed to be complete, it was completed in a timely manner. But modreqs are just a fraction of what you have to worry about as im sure you know. From ban appeals to just making sure the servers run like clock work. Through the highs and lows, you made sure the community chugs through like a steaming locomotive.


* Everyone else not mentioned- Wow. What a great group of people. Hopefully I have had the chance to meet and chat with you a bit (if I haven’t yet PM me :D). You guys have been great friends of mine ever since day one. I’ve never found a server quite like this one with such a great user base. You guys are the important thing. Without you, these servers won’t thrive long. Thats why you need to stick around and tell your friends about this server, thats why if you see a griefed house, modreq it, thats why if someone needs a hand with something, you lend a hand. **YOU** practically control the server. So I hope when the next revs come out you will lend a hand to one another, and continue to be the thriving server base we were and still are today.  



                                                                                     -nolanater5711 (Nolan)
 

**EDIT** This is not a suicide note, or a goodbye, just wanted to get a little deep I suppose. Thanks for the concerns though :)

**EDIT 2** Wow thanks for all the kind words, I really appreciate them :)

Additionally, prior to the launch (sometime late Thursday), the server will be going to down in order to do some much needed back end upgrading. This will minimize downtime as we transition from the beta to the full game. As always, please expect some delays and temp maps as all the plugins update.

1. Currently **fire will spread** from lava and adjacent sources, again due to CraftBukkit bugs.  The fire will hurt you, but it will **not** destroy blocks.

1. **ModTRS** (our modreq plugin) **needs an upgrade** - while we're doing this, /modlist will incorrectly show everyone as a mod, and you'll occasionally see bright green messages referring to new modreqs, modreqs being completed, etc.  You can safely disregard this - use /list to see which mods and admins are online.

Likely you have not heard my name before today. This matters not.

I have placed three missile silos throughout our fair land. In each missile is a nuclear warhead. 

These missiles have been targeted at various structures in Creative. A map is attached. If the ransom is not received, in full, in 48 hours time, I will launch these missiles. (9:30 PM Eastern Wednesday)

There is a fence, and at the end of that fence there is a rock. That rock has no business sitting where it is. Place the ransom (1 Billion in gold bullion) under this rock.

X:560
Y:85
Z:-1535

If the mods or Admins interfere, I will launch the missiles. However, I am looking for a second in command. The first person to find all three missiles, and PM me the exact target coordinates for each, will win a prize redeemable from Steam.

After almost two years of working on Brom and its various franchises I’ve decided it’s time to branch out and try something new. I’m going to follow my dream of building roads to connect the towns and cities of the server and I hope you’ll join me!

The RBA will be supportive, friendly, and open to anyone who wants to help out. We’ll focus on providing material support as well as organizational guidance for as many road projects as possible. 

_____________

**Why roads?**

When I first joined the server as a newbie many moons ago I got my start by walking the player made roads out of spawn. I found a nice spot half way down the East Road and built a house. Not long after I started making friends in the neighborhood and haven’t looked back since. 

I feel that roads are far more accessible to newbies than the rail system (though I do agree that the rails are extremely important) or nether. Even a poor, naked, new guy can find and navigate a road. The added benefits of this spill out to the whole server as roads help to direct and organize development in such a way that strongly discourages derp and ugly sprawl. Finally, roads encourage exploration and make it easier to meet new people. 


**What’s the plan?**

Our initial priority will be to connect cities and towns to spawn and to each other. Ideally we would like to partner with cities on individual projects and arrange some sort of resource sharing. However, in the event that no one’s requesting connections we’ll just do our own thing. 

The road designs will be simple, affordable, and quick to build. They will be well lit with signs pointing out nearby destinations and will be dotted with public rest stops containing a bed, crafting, food, and other amenities. 

Our first project will be connecting the city of Pico (or, I suppose, its base camp) to spawn as soon as possible after map launch. 

______________

Once the map launches we’ll head out with the Pico folks as they hunt for a spot. Once they’re established we’ll start blazing a trail back to spawn. The eventual RBA headquarters will be somewhere on the road between Pico and spawn. Once the Pico road is up and running we’ll start on projects to other cities that may be interested. 

**Updates and additional discussion will be found at /r/pveroads**

So, join me, fellow infrastructure nerds! Together we will slice through the unforgiving wilderness in order to provide safe passage for civilization’s advancement and growth!

Over that time, he has both witnessed and helped guide the slow evolution of PVE, from its infancy in early 2011, through the major improvements to PVE gameplay in Beta 1.8 and Release, to the bustling community it has now become.  Along the way, he’s seen much of what works and what doesn’t on the servers, and always has practical ideas for keeping the community strong.

The server's address is **chaos.nerd.nu:1337**.  The port number is required, if you leave it off you'll get an error message about not being on the whitelist.

Here's how it's setup:

* No /give, just like survival
* No /tp, /warp, /spawn, etc just like survival
* WorldGuard protections are disabled, so everything goes.  Water flows, lava flows, obsidian is placeable, fire burninates, and TNT explodinates.
* PVP is turned on globally, and obviously health is turned on
* There are no protected areas at all, except 30x30 surrounding spawn
* Because this is chaos, we decided to mix things up a bit and all previously banned users are not banned on here.
* Regarding the rules - there pretty much are none.  Except racism, hate speech, etc.  Keep that off the server or be banned.
* We reserve the right to disable stuff that lags the server too bad and makes it unplayable for the masses.
* The lack of rules applies to the mods / admins also, we can do whatever we feel like doing.
* The map should be considered *volatile*.  We can reset it at any time, for any reason.  For that matter, consider the server *volatile* as well.  If we choose to stop this experiment at some point for any reason, we will.
* There won't be backups, cartographs, etc published for this server.  When the server goes down, it takes last priority over the existing creative and survival servers.
* Do not message the mod chat with chaos server issues.
* This is hosted in Denmark, so if you're getting lag, it's likely network related.
* **Edit:** Client hacks are not permitted.  Those caught using hacks will be asked to stop, and banned if they do not.

And one final note.  While we know people have been screaming for a PvE only server, please don't think that setting this chaos server up indicates our lack of willingness to do so.  A PvE only server is likely to be much, much more popular than this chaos server, and as such we want proper hosting in the same datacenter as creative and survival.  This is on our todo list, but hardware must first be acquired.  Be assured we are working on it.

Not only are we updating the server software when the beta is released, we are also doing a map reset on both creative and survival.

First things first - before the reset, we like to go out with a bang.  So, approximately 24 hours before the map reset / beta release on the 20th, we will do one final backup of the creative and survival maps and then open them up for a TNT party.  The backups will be posted to [nerd.nu/maps](http://nerd.nu/maps) at some point during the day.  Cuboid protections will be turned off, chest protection will be disabled, and TNT will be enabled.  We are still banning fire, lava, and water mainly for the fact that when they are mass-spammed, any users in the area will get knocked off the server and be unable to join in the griefing.  Be aware that massive TNT explosions have a tendency to crash your client, so don't go overboard.  We will update the MOTD that you see upon logging in to let you know that the TNT party is in progress.

When the beta is released, you will likely see a message upon attempting to login to the server, something along the lines of ""Outdated client"".  When this happens, we will setup a vanilla server at c.nerd.nu running a fresh map and **no plugins**.  This means no /give, /tp, /warp or any other commands that hey0 and it's plugins provide.  This will be a **temporary map**.  All the existing mods and admins will be ops on the server and can give you items, teleport you, etc at their discretion.

At this point, we will be at the mercy of waiting for the hey0 server mod to update.  We won't have a timeline for how long this will take, but it usually happens within 24 hours.  Once we get the update, we'll need to test compatibility of the plugins that we utilize: WorldGuard, Cuboid, Borderlands, and GriefAlert being the most important.  The technical admins will be on Mumble during this phase of testing, and will possibly enlist the help of others on Mumble to test.

Once we have a stable hey0 server up and running with our usual plugins, we will be copying over the chosen spawns from the [spawn contest](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/emosj/spawn_design_contest/).  Our focus will be on getting survival up and running first, then creative.  We will update the MOTD's that you see upon logging in with a message once the map is finalized, until then, don't get too attached as it could be reset at any time.

If at any point during this process you want an update, please join our [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) server at mumble.nerd.nu port 6162.

1. Inside that, open the bin/ folder, and swap out the existing minecraft.jar for the one you just downloaded. (Note that you will lose any mods installed on the previous .jar, so you may want to hang onto it for later.)

* The Bukkit team and all those in Bukkit IRC who answered my questions.  And gave me that pink plugin developer badge.  It's snazzy.

But as I was digging away, I had a bit of a brainstorm. I have no idea if this is even possible, but it might make for a nice bit of fiction for you all to read.

First thing they notice is the portal to The End closes. Huh, that's odd, right? But surely we'll just build another one with the mods permission. Mods aren't responding? Oh well, we'll just build it over the location of an old one. Except it doesn't work. No End Portal. No limitless supply of easy enchantments and XP.

The next thing that happens mobs can now destroy blocks. The Withers caged up around the world break free, and it's all hands on deck boys. Enchanted weapons and militias muster, and people log in to find huge holes blown into their houses. Seneca and Endor look like war zones, and anyone that had them on a private estate... Well, I'm sure we can rebuild in time...

But we've got other problems. Creepers are spawning more and more frequently, especially in the underground railways. Explosions are inevitable, tracks break down, the worst ones dump the unfortunate miners into a cavern full of monsters or pit of lava. Ouch. It gets harder and harder to move around as the days go on, and people have to bring stacks of tracks with them wherever they go to repair the damaged railway. Except the mobs keep coming, with greater and greater frequency. But that's just in the Overworld, the Nether still connects all the cities.

Except the next thing that happens is all the Nether portals erupt in explosions of lava, sending streams of molten rock through main city streets, fire now able to burn through the cosmetic building materials we all take for granted. Coloured cotton and wood houses burn like matches in the night, as more mobs descend on the players, hounding them into their houses.

The next worst thing to happen is all the beds disappear. We can no longer spawn near our caches of weapons, armour, and blocks. We're each and every one of us sent back to spawn, to try and trudge through a nightmare hellscape of broken tracks and burning, empty cities. It's like a scene out of The Road, players scavenging the most basic of blocks, hoarding iron and coal like diamonds.

But there is a rumour, at the farthest edge of the map several players have banded together, built a makeshift fortress, and are rebuilding. The thing is: They have the last bed on the server. They can respawn as soon as they fall in battle to plug the walls before Creepers and skeletons can make it into the main fortress. Groups of players start a migration, away from spawn, carrying seeds and potatoes, wearing leather armor like refugees from Mad Max and trying to coax along stubborn livestock with the promise of wheat. Weapons are crude, stone swords mostly but a few players have enough flint for arrows. Many fall on the exodus to be sent back to spawn, their gear scooped up by the surviving players. Some wait for their friends to rejoin the group, others continue on. Those who wait are trapped in the respawn loop along with their compatriots, quitting the server in frustration. Those who continue on bring much needed supplies and manpower to the fledgling fortress.

Then the final apocalyptic event: All crafting tables vanish, and nobody can craft anything. What has been stockpiled is all that can be used, pix become essential for mining cobblestone to be thrown into a furnace to be made into stone and stone bricks. The line holds, for now. Every able bodied avatar is armed as best they can scrounge. Maybe a few heroes still carry enchanted bows with infinite enchantments, and the glint of unbreaking diamond swords can be picked out amongst the gloom along the ramparts. But the nights are growing longer, things are breaking apart, and the crops are having a hard time growing in the snow.

Then one night, a scouting party can be heard in local screaming for help. All caps, all typos. They were out hunting skeletons for bone meal on the open plains, relatively safe. Except from over a hill they heard a sound nobody on the server had heard in days. Withers. Four of them. The scouts ran all the way back to the fortress. The Withers followed hot on their heels, and death followed the four Withers. Skeletons and Creepers mob the walls and gates, the defenders throwing everything they've got at the small army of hostiles.

Clever traps help thin the numbers, zombies and skeles tumbling into pits of lava dug out days ago and hidden by pressure plates and pistons. But the Withers are destroying blocks everywhere, battering down walls and giving the moats a few stepping stones for the monsters to crawl over. They're inside the gates now, picking off one or two players here and there but the majority are dying from the Withering barrage. Finally, the archers manage to bring down two of the three headed boss mobs, another going down to a lucky elevated fellow and his sword. But the last one is tearing apart the settlement, crops and livestock are blown to shreds as people run everywhere, trying to bring it down, but not before it destroys the last bed on the server. Those who die fighting it respawn impossibly far away, cut off from their friends. But the remaining survivors at last destroy the final Wither. As it dies and drops it's Nether Star, a single crafting table appears beside it's corpse, only capable of building one kind of item.

Someone digs out twelve cubes of Obsidian, someone else smelts the glass. Gold and Emeralds are formed into blocks and four beacons light up the sky as the sun rises, igniting the zombies and skeletons. There is nothing left, all the tools are shattered, all the crops are gone, and the livestock is scattered or blown to hamburger. But those four beacons blaze into the sky for the rest of the day, and when night falls and the monsters descend on the ruins they find no players. If they are capable of coherent thought, they might wonder at the four beacons left behind, blazing in the night like perfect falling stars.",PvE,False,,t5_2s52h,1375252359.0,pve,,True,t3_1jemry,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1jemry/how_the_world_could_end/,

But the nether gate being all the way up there and the rail station way down there is such a pain (and lethal considering the 2 block bridges). Some could say that spawn is a player trap (people bringing their Dtools/Darmor simply to fall to their deaths).

I still don't know why the staff okay'd this spawn, but as long as transit isnt a pain as it is now it would all be fine and dandy.

For those of you who don't know, the reason why item frames were originally banned was that clusters of them would cause fps drops to people nearby and groups of them would destabilize the surrounding area. 1.4.6 helped with some of the fps problems with normal items, but maps in item frames still caused the same lag problems. 

We've now sorted out a way to separate the two, so maps will still remain banned from placing in frames, but all other items will be placeable! A word of caution, item frames will still cause lag in large groups (like 30+), so please keep your use of them in moderation, and be aware of how many are in nearby buildings you if you live in a city or town.

There has been a lot of back and forth on the use of Cuboid.

Overview: Cuboid is a tool that allows the user to edit the terrain and create walls of blocks simply by selecting the two endpoints.

In the near future there will be two servers; a creative server, and a survival server.

The survival server **will not** have cuboid. It will also not have item spawning or teleportation.

This thread is regarding the creative server. The biggest argument against cuboid has been that it takes away from the survival aspect. So, just to be clear, once there are two servers, this decision only affects the creative server.

Here is my suggestion: Due to it's destructive potential, Cuboid use should be allowed for a small group of very trusted people (a subset of mods). These mods can use cuboid to assist other players in leveling land, creating starting foundation, replacing blocks, and creating walls. Now obviously, if a structure is created entirely of cuboid, it is pointless. A structure that took no creativity or imagination to build is pointless, and does undermine the point of ""Creative"" mode. But, this is the case for any silly structure built, even without Cuboid. But in the case of very very large structures, cuboid can simply be a time saver. It allows you to complete tedious tasks quickly, while still allowing you to be creative. Remember, this is not the survival server. As long as we have item spawning, stick-delete and teleportation, we're already ""cheating"".

(For all those familiar with Cuboid functions, the Sphere, Ball, Faces, and Walls commands will not be allowed. Simply too easy to screw up. See my [Cuboid Tutorial here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/dpx0n/official_server_welcome_and_tutorial/).)

Please vote in the comments, choosing from the list below. 1 = yes, 2 = no. The letters simply denote the reason why.

---------------------------------------

1a. Cuboid should be allowed for a small group, because I understand it can't be given to everyone, and I would like their help for my projects.

1b. Cuboid should be allowed for a small group, because I don't care. It doesn't affect me.

1c. Cuboid should be allowed for a small group, because this is the creative server and there's no such thing at cheating.

1d. Cuboid should be allowed for a small group, because since they would be on call, it would expand everyone's limitations of creative mode.

I really enjoy exploring the maps heavily before settling on a quiet spot and occasionally helping out people I pass in the wilds.  

I often dig my builds under or into the ground rather than above it and occasionally pop up a structure in a town I admire.

This map though is different to all of the others, to me it feels like I have been gifted the opportunity to play my first day in the game all over again.  The terrain I have traversed so far is akin to a matured offspring of revision 4 and 7 with wondrous new features sparking a real need to explore rather than settle.

Spawn is amazing and the back story to our arrival in the world here is intriguing to say the least, and I for one can't wait to find out what all of the log books reveal.

Listening in on mumble I heard people exclaiming with delight at the new mushrooms, enormous trees and the magical ice forests. Floating islands and lakes within cavernous cenotes bordered by dense forests and random plentiful glowstone in he overworld, I am honestly astounded that this is the work of just one of the admins (with a maybe a little help from a few others?) 

I have only really been able to see the North of the map for myself and will be taking my time in selecting a place to make my home this rev as usual, but with the added motivation that by the time I have done a full lap of this truly challenging terrain, the lag from 150 other explorers will have settled to a reasonable level, and that the environment on this rev really does deserve the capital E.",PvE,False,,t5_2s52h,False,pve,,True,t3_1bux03,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1bux03/im_a_nerdnu_hermit_and_the_environment_in_this/,
1359214309.0,32,self.mcpublic,17bfol,Let's talk about Iron Grinders,38,6,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/17bfol/lets_talk_about_iron_grinders/,"One of the biggest changes I've noticed in rev10 is the prevalence of iron grinders. For those of you who are unfamiliar with them, basically they are made up of ""pods"" with a lots of doors and water collection, as well as 4 cells each with villagers.

Since each cell has 4 villagers, there are 16 villagers per pod.

The problem is that I've heard people talking about making bigger and better iron grinders for rev11. There's nothing wrong at all with wanting to make bigger and better things on p.nerd.nu, but bigger grinders will increase the number of villagers. The main grinder east of spawn, for example, has 12 pods so requires 192 passive mobs.

The thing I want to prevent is people taking the time to create large iron grinders and then having to shut them down because the number of villagers causes too much lag (villagers are excluded from the mob plugin). To prevent this happening, I was hoping we could come to some sort of agreement before rev11 starts up. Either:

1. Set a hard limit to the number of pods a city could have in their iron grinder

2. Once a city has produced a 15 pod grinder, they could request it to be replaced by a single iron golem spawner (spawner produces 1 golem / 20 seconds, about same as 15 pods)

3. Once a city has produced a single functional pod, have the villagers removed and place a single golem spawner in the pod with modified attributes to produce one every 5 minutes.

4. Do no policy on the issue right now, but if the villagers do end up causing noticeable lag then going with option #3

Personally I think that option #4 would be the best, but thought that it would be best to talk about it before the rev starts.

As a large server we face a lot of challenges, catering to a huge user base, running 3 separate servers with totally different goals, and of course those players that wish to ruin the fun for others.

Today we were the victim of a cute little exploit we had not encountered before, it was being used to crash our servers by a few individuals who for whatever reasons dislike our community.

After we spotted this being used against us the team of techs jumped straight on it, Deaygo has patched and updated our bukkit version in record time ( *really, the dude is awesome* ) and we have alerted the bukkit team to the issue.

While we all hate downtime we hope you understand that sometimes it is unavoidable, as a large community we are bound to be a target for people like this.

I thank those of you who used outage@nerd.nu, the lack of subreddit posts made me very happy \^_^

We hope the new patch can provide stability while we continue to iron out some of the other issues faced by our servers.

In case you missed it, PvE will be resetting to a new map when 1.3 comes out. I’m going to give a few specific details on what to expect for the next PvE map.

About a month ago [we had an awesome discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/w6li3/ok_pve_its_time_to_start_planning_for_the_next/) about map generation. Thank you to everyone who participated. It was great to get your input and your opinions will help determine the direction our maps take in the revisions to come. However, after consulting with the tech and head admins, it was decided that we need to make the elimination of PvE’s long standing lag issues a priority. 

The crippling lag, crashes, and rollbacks (especially at the start of the map) are just killing us. Even after the mob cap went into effect PvE’s CPU and RAM usage were significantly higher than what they should have been. At this point we need to consider the possibility that the modified terrain is somehow part of the problem. We want to have more than 80 people on launch day. We want to ditch the mob cap. 

So our plan is to go back to basics. We’re going to become a mean, lean, block simulating machine by stripping down to a small vanilla map. The map will be generated using pure vanilla 1.3 settings and will not be modified in any way. On launch day the map size will be 4000x4000 with the possibility of expanding later on. If all goes well and there are minimal issues this rev we can look into reintroducing modified terrain in Rev 10. Hopefully in the end we will have a much more complete understanding of the lag issue. With any luck we will eliminate it. 

___________________________________

**Revision 9 Details**

**Map size**: 4000x4000 at the start, possible expansion to 6000x6000 later on.

**Generation details**: Vanilla 1.3 generation using the large biomes world type.

**Terrain modifications, ore plumping**: None.

**What’s the map like?**: Good mix of all the biomes, plenty of 1.3 features (temples, pyramids, villages, extreme hills) to go around.

**Portals**: 4 portals at the corners and one at spawn to start (who knows, maybe a couple secrets, too). More to be added if the map expands.

**Mob cap**: Hopefully we can get rid of the mob cap. We will see the return of normal farms, functioning grinders, and a generally populated wilderness. Though we may need some sort regional limitation to prevent absurd (as in many thousands of entities per farm) sheep and villager breeding. For the good of the server, be responsible with your farms. 

**Player cap**: We're aiming for well over 100 (I'm hoping for 150ish) players with minimal lag and no crashing. Everyone who wants to play should be able to get in.

Up until last Friday.....since then it has been a dicksplosion. 

Friday my friend was toiling away in the mines clearing out some diamonds. Out of nowhere a townie from next door runs up and mines them right out from under her. I know the mines are public but she cleared the way to the vein and it was clear she was actively working on it. She got upset, called it an evening and logged out.

Saturday she logs in with a fresh attitude ready to build! She quickly finds out she can no longer build in her already established base because the same town that ganked the diamonds has been given protection on it. The solution was to give her access, not remove the erroneously given protection. How happy would you be with that resolution, a whole group of strangers that have already proven themselves to be rude as hell at the very least now have access to modify or destroy your build as they wish?  Now, I wasn't there to witness it but I'm pretty sure her [head exploded.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY-03vYYAjA)  Why was this protection granted in the first place? It was obvious the town had not built anything on the land, isn't that a requirement? Did the mod who granted it not come out to even look at what they were granting? 

Now for my own thrilling sob story! Yesterday, I was robbed. At first I was confused and thought it was one of my friends. Then I realized I did not know this person and I gave the obligatory ""WTF!"" shout. They saw me and my...question...and instantly ran away as I was frantically checking the locks and inventory of my chests. I didn't catch their name at first because of how quick they bolted when I busted them but then as I'm evaluating the situation they actually ask if it is ok to take things from private chests that are unlocked. The response from the server was yes. I don't know where you peeps are from but I've never been in a situation where WTF translates into ""Hello neighbor, take whatever you like"". This person knew these chests were supposed to be locked, my fault I admit. They had two choices, ask me if it was public or take my stuff and log before I could talk to them. They chose to take my stuff and log. How is that not being a dick, how is that not a violation of the Golden Rule of the servers? Instead of taking the law into my own hands I put in a /modreq which was closed without so much as a /msg to me. 

I was guide for Everquest so I understand being a mod is usually a thankless (sometimes hated, always unpaid) job. I appreciate the sacrifice of gaming time these people put forth to keep the server running and I realize yesterday was chaotic, the server bounced about 20 times while I was on. 

Life is life, shit happens. These things have happened and I don't expect a resolution but I have to ask, is this the type of environment we can expect on this server? A place where a town can simply take over your land and people are free to **knowingly** steal mats from you because you forgot to lock a chest?

There are a few big changes on the way that will significantly alter certain aspects of how we play the game. 

**We plan on these changes going live this Friday, December 9**

One of our goals in running the PvE server is to provide an experience that is as close to vanilla Minecraft as is practical. Recent technical advances have enabled us to take a few steps in that direction. I'll run down each of the changes and provide details as to how things will work. 

---------

***-/home and beds-***

Our tech admins have managed to get beds working as they are supposed to. That means that we no longer need the /home command and it will be disabled. Although we have all got used to using /home to get around, it is time to give up this crutch.

Beds will work exactly as in single player. To set your spawn: get in the bed at night and wait until the screen fades, then click the get out of bed button. When you die you will now respawn at your bed, not the server spawn point. If everyone goes to bed at the same time the server will skip to day, but don't count on that ever happening. There will be a brief period (a week or so) where /home and beds are both active to allow people to get things all set up. 

---------

***-Water/Lava buckets-***

The bucket testing is going well on survival and we feel ready to implement it on PvE. Here's how it will work:

-You have to gather water or lava in a bucket like in single player. You can place the source block, but **it will not flow**. 

-If you need flowing water/lava, place the source and make a /modreq to make it flow

-Mods will no longer place water/lava for things like farms, moats, incinerators, ect. 

-**PVP with lava is strictly prohibited**. This includes placing lava next to someone to hurt them, putting lava where someone is likely to fall into it, ect. **Anyone found to be using lava for PVP will receive a minimum 1 month ban**. If lava buckets become a problem we will disable them, so please be good. 

---------

***-Nether-***

Just a reminder, there will be a nether only reset this Friday. 

The trade signs have been fixed. After this new nether has been picked clean we will set up one or more nether trade signs at spawn. Exact pricing will be determined at that time. 

Hopefully this will be the last nether reset. Once the trade signs are set up and the nether is stable we will start doing protections there again. Until an announcement is made, however, nether protections are still on hold.

1350886856.0,33,self.mcpublic,11vuuz,[Announcement] All servers will be resetting for 1.4 (details inside),38,5,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/11vuuz/announcement_all_servers_will_be_resetting_for_14/,"As you may know, Minecraft 1.4, a.k.a. the [Pretty Scary Update](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pretty_Scary_Update), is slated to come out this Wednesday, October 24.

This is the official announcement that **we will be resetting our three main servers - c.nerd.nu, p.nerd.nu, and s.nerd.nu - for 1.4.** This means that once each server has been properly upgraded for the 1.4 patch, we will be launching a new revision, on a new map, for each, to take advantage of the new 1.4 content.

----

**What is a reset?** We take down the current map and replace it with an entirely new one.  The replacement map for each server will be completely new terrain, with a new spawn.  Everyone starts fresh: empty inventory, no builds, nothing is carried over.

**Will the new revisions launch the moment 1.4 comes out?** No - we can't launch our new revisions until CraftBukkit and all our plugins are updated.  We don't expect this to take as long as 1.3, but we can't say for sure.  As with 1.3, we will try to keep you as informed as possible regarding our progress, and will announce each revision launch in advance.  Keep your eyes on this subreddit and our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/redditpublic)!

**What happens after 1.4 comes out but before the new revisions launch?** We're still deciding what to do exactly, and will let you know once we've finalized the plan.  I can say that (1) there will likely be some kind of 1.4 temp chaos map, and that (2) at minimum all three servers will stay on their current revision until 1.4 comes out.

**What is the status of the current revisions?** They are all still alive and running, and will remain active until *at least* the moment 1.4 comes out.  Remember that all rules continue to apply until the end of the revision.  Once the revisions end, they'll be available for download at http://nerd.nu/backups.

**What are the changes in 1.4, and how will they affect the servers?** Check out the [wiki page](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pretty_Scary_Update) for more info on 1.4. We won't know for sure exactly what 1.4 looks like until it launches.  We'll let you know what features will or won't be included, but it will likely be some time after 1.4 comes out.

**What's the plan for the new (C, P, S) revision?** Look for more details from the server admins in the coming days!

[Server load diagram](http://i.imgur.com/QXM2h.jpg) - 8 is 100% (roughly speaking)

With load averages well over our capacity, we are unable to launch creative (hell, we're barely running 2 servers!)

To combat this, we have been profiling the servers intensively over the past couple of days. While this has resulted in the occasional crash, we finally have results that provide some measure of insight into the causes. We have pinpointed several of the lockups that are causing the main bukkit thread to halt, resulting in a *freezing* type affect on game play that many of you will now be familiar with. 

The results of the profiling precipitated a rewrite of SafeBuckets, the temporary removal of plugins, and more. As some of you have well noticed we have experimented with many possible causes of lag; at times NoCheat was even removed from the servers for a duration. We are exploring all options.

We also tuned some plugin configurations, and are continuing to trial a custom bukkit build on PvE, with good results. Server load is still spiking, but for the most part it has come down, meaning we are steps closer to launching Creative again!

Over the coming days we will continue to profile the servers and speed things up where possible. We avoid affecting game play where possible, but in certain cases we have little other choice - profiling is a resource-hog itself!

I am sorry to say we have a *lot* of work to do in order to launch Creative. We need to get the server load to a manageable form and once again update NerdBukkit to remove all growth from the server ( *Both as an anti-griefing tactic and as a removal of a resource intensive portion of game play not needed* ). The map has been ready for a while but we just haven't had the capacity to run it :(

While we are all getting annoyed that Creative is slow to launch I hope this provides some measure of insight into why we have been taking so long. We are honestly worried that launching another server will not only just be a lagged out server nobody can play on, but that it will in turn bring the other two down with it. In the event that we *cannot* get the servers to a reasonable state soon, we will invest in more hardware. Doing so is a last-resort, as the issues may be fixed at any point rendering the new hardware redundant, and the increase in monthly spend is not something to be taken lightly.

The last few updates have been fairly minor and have involved a great deal of work from our faithful tech admins and a fairly limited time delay for us players... 

However this one is more like the old days.... This update is such an overhaul of the way minecraft works that the tech admins and thus us are at the mercy of Bukkit developers and plug in developers. These people have said, it is going to take time.

As it stand creative is a disjointed sandbox of people and places. Sure, there are good builds here and there but the entire server feels disconnected in a way.

Community projects are basically boring and quickly forgotten, minecart rail designs are degrading as they are practically worthless on the server, not enough people want to help with any projects whatsoever, the map gets stale in under 3 weeks and the average age level of the player base is 10.

Our plan was to disable flying on the creative server, simple as that. This change is intended to bring players more enjoyment out of the creative server and better establish a sense of community. Originally we hoped to disable it in only specific areas, but that turned out to be impossible tech-wise (so don't ask). The other admins have had disagreements with this, so we resolved to put it to a vote by the community. Below there will be two different comments, one will  state

""Yes, I would like to change the current creative mode"".

The other will state:

""No, I want to keep the current state of the Creative server"".

Only upvotes will be counted in this poll (aka don't bother downvoting the comment you disagree with). We all have our own reasons for this change and we would like the community to share their opinions on this change as well.

Once you've made a modreq to get a region protected, you will be able to do the following:

1. Region Owners can now add members to their regions using the the command:

            /region addmember REGIONNAME USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ... 
    
2. Region owners can remove members using the following:

            /region removemember REGIONNAME USERNAME1 USERNAM2 ... 
    
3. Region owners can add additional owners using the following:

           /region addowner REGIONNAME USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...
    
Region members will have full access to edit inside of a given region (say, a town), just as if you made a modreq to get someone added. Region owners are the same, but owners are able to add and remove members as well as add owners. If you want an owner removed, you must still make a modreq to do so. This setup is much like how subreddits are moderated, where you can't have a coup to overthrow town mayors.


This should cut down on modreqs, and give more control to players' protected areas. As always, if you need help please feel free to PM the head admins, contact us in-game, on the forums, here on reddit or in this very thread with questions comments or concerns.

1293647143.0,33,self.mcpublic,et75c,How to Survive in PvP,41,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/et75c/how_to_survive_in_pvp/,"There are a lot of posts lately about PvP, and how to improve the overall player experience on the SMP server.  Not suprisingly, most of the suggestions involve rule changes, server modifications, or simply banning successful PK'ers.  It seems people would rather have the world change for them rather than adapt themselves to the environment.  In hopes that there are people out there who would appreciate learning how to better survive in *Survival* mode, I thought I would create a list of things you can do to avoid getting killed.


Before you downvote this post based solely on the fact that it was made by me, please keep in mind that some players may find this information useful.  I kill a lot of people, and this is a sincere attempt to make a list of things that make my life harder.


* LWC works now.  The first thing a new player should do is punch enough trees to build a chest.  This will take you less than 10 minutes.
* Lock your chest with '/lwc create private', and use it to store the supplies you aren't using.  If you're building a house, why do you need to carry all of the iron you've ever mined?  There's no reason why anyone should lose hours of work in PvP.
* Build.  A.  Mine.  A deep mine is safest.  The game is called Minecraft for a reason.  If you're gonna spend 99% of your time on the surface of a PvP area, punching trees for you wooden house-- you will die.
* Use 'shift' to crouch.  I don't know how the exact mechanics work, but this appears to make it very difficult to see your nameplate.  I've only killed one person who used this trick, and that's because his friends ratted him out (I guess they didn't read the rule about being a dick ;).
* Don't walk around in diamond armor unless you expect to PvP.  It's not a very useful deterent, and unless you're a notorious PK'er, you just look like a walking jackpot.  I don't even wear diamond armor very much anymore, because nothing will attract PvP attention more than that.
* Know where PvE zones are, and look around you.  Nametags work both ways, and I can't tell you the amount of times a person has gotten away because they saw me coming, and made it to a road.
* Bows are very annoying.  I hate when someone uses bows in PvP, mostly because it's hard to tell whether they will work or not, depending on server lag.  It's a good way to keep people at a distance most of the time-- just hope they don't have more arrows than you.
* If all else fails, consider getting a foothold in one of the PvE areas.  Chromium(?) is pretty dense right now, but unless you're Osama bin Unix, most other towns will welcome you with open arms.


That's all I got for now.


**Edit 1:**
Changed '/lwc create password' to '/lwc create private'.  LWC stores your passwords in cleartext on the server, and is therefore extremely insecure.

Minecraft is a *terrible* pvp game. It's just not designed around it. Multiple examples. 1) You can see other people's names through rocks. Line of sight has no meaning. You can't hide in a cave or secret base. You can't even HAVE a secret base. What the hell, seriously. 2) You drop all your items on death, and on vanilla/without LWC (which the server currently lacks) your chest is open to robbery too - meaning, in other words, unless your chest was well hidden or you got lucky, you just lost all of your work since progression in MC is basically entirely inventory-based. Minecraft essentially has permadeath on large survival servers. I wouldn't play on PvP servers in WoW if every time I got ganked I lost everything in my inventory.

If I wanted to fight other players I would play Starcraft or Call of Duty. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one here who likes survival but doesn't like being ganked and griefed by trolls.

It still requires some beta testing in time for P launch, but I can share with you some things for what to expect.  

* Endermen in the End now have red eyes and a gray bar around their face.  These will become completely hostile, which means as soon as you enter the End, they will start swarming you.  However, these new aggressive Endermen are not without their weaknesses, and Smite will now do 4x damage against them.  This means that as long as you have Smite V on your sword, you can one-hit KO these Endermen in the End.  Also, punching these Endermen with a torch will set them on fire.

* The most important change is that the End's Ender Dragon has been replaced with a Pink Dragon!  This Pink Dragon behaves similarly to the stock Ender Dragon (i.e., it's not nice and wants to kill you), except it has the ability to shoot fireballs similar to the ones fired by Ghasts.  Like Ghast fireballs, they travel slowly and are relatively easy to dodge.  Unlike Ghast fireballs, they cannot be deflected and CAN destroy End Stone.  Take too long to slay the Dragon, and you might find yourself parkouring over the remains of the End island!

We'll reveal more as the map gets closer to launch, but for now, some teaser screenshots:

Revision 9 was a lot of fun and the PvE community built some amazing things. From individual builds to giant cities and everything in between, I'm always amazed by why our community puts together. I'm excited to see so much planning going on for the new map. However, it would be helpful to have some information about how the map will be structured and what our plans are. 

____________

**Map Size**:

One of the reasons we scaled down from a 6k map in rev 8 to a 4k map in rev 9 was to test the impact of map size on server performance. In the end it was determined that map size is one of the most important factors when it comes to how well the server runs. For the foreseeable future all maps, including rev 10, will be 4k. This size worked well for us in the past and sustained rev 9 for 3 months. 

So, just to be clear, map will be 4000x4000 blocks, the same as Rev 9. 

____________

**Terrain**:

The main reason we went with vanilla terrain in Rev 9 was to see if somehow modified terrain was impacting server performance. In the end the tech admins determined that modified terrain in and of itself doesn't do anything to slow the server down. Rather, it was the large build up of entities (hostile mobs) that was the problem. Thanks to this, I'm pleased to announce the return of modified terrain for Rev 10!

This will be a very special map with a unique generation scheme. The center of the map from 0,0 (spawn) to +/-1000 in each direction will be a vanilla generation with some interesting World Painter features added here and there. For the most part, however, it will be flat and tame. 

From +/-1000 to +/-2000 the map will consist of unique terrain generated by the Terrain Control mod. There will be massive jaw dropping land formations and sky islands. This is the type of terrain that the PvE server was started on and that we most recently were able to enjoy in Rev 7. 

_________

**Ores and plumping**: 

The center portion of the map with the vanilla generation will have vanilla ore levels and distribution. 

The outer portion of the map with the TC terrain will feature ore plumping. The exact nature of the plumping will vary depending on biome. We'll leave the details to you guys to discover but some examples are:

-Iron and coal can be found from bedrock all the way to the tops of the highest land formations and sky islands in all TC biomes.

-Extreme hills biomes in TC terrain have emeralds up to the top of the mountains and diamonds up to y50.

-Jungle biomes in TC terrain can have lapis, redstone, and gold ore up to main surface level (y70 or so).

Caves in the TC terrain are essentially the same as vanilla. 

__________

**Portal placement**:

The portals will be in the corners again, same as Rev 9. They will be placed close to the terrain dividing line, around +/-1000 in each direction. There may also be several secret portals, who knows. 

__________

**Spawn**:

Spawn will be a single building surrounded by simple landscaping at sea level. The portal and train station are visible from and right next to the exit from the rules. 

__________

**Mob policy**:

We've been testing c45y's new mob management plugin on the server over the past few days. Testing has gone extremely well. The plugin is amazing! It will be active in Rev 10 with the current settings. Any changes to the config will be announced in game and [on the wiki](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Pve_Mob_Plugin).

If you'd like to see an image of where we are now you can take a look at the TODO list on the wiki. http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Todolist

Here is a status of all the servers.


* **Creative**: *Up and running*. Some minor tweaking of plugins needed.


* **Chaos**: *Up and running*. Needs a few not-so-minor changes to be truly chaotically fun.


* **PvE**: *Not up*. Needs to have a creeper nerf plugin working (i.e. creepers can't blow up spawn/protected areas) also /home is broken.
After this we could probably roll it out. All we'd REALLY need is the creeper nerf which is coming.

* **Survival**: *Not Up*. As well as the above it also needs to be marked out for seperate pve areas too possibly.


What I'm looking for though here is suggestions. The only two servers currently operating are chaos and creative. What are they missing? What's wrong with them? Any and all suggestions considered, take a look at the to do list to see if your suggestion is already there.



My Goal is to have the four servers running and stable by at most this day week. I've written some (very poor) plugins to help and AllNaturalX has worked his butt off too so thanks for your patience and we'll be back online as quick as we can.


In the mean time try out chaos or creative.

During high usage times we regularly run at 4-9 ticks per second while the ideal is 18-20. This makes everything run at a quarter the speed it should thus making movement, PVP, smelting, etc drastically slower.

It seems obvious a large part of this lag is caused by players idling in experience grinders letting massive numbers of mobs build up so they can kill them all at once to gain levels. Just today a player sat in a blaze mob grinder long enough to make 600 blazes spawn and kill any client that came close. That many mobs also has a large effect on server lag.

So, starting now, we have a new plugin running. Its job is to keep the number of hostile mobs in a chunk limited to 20. It will kill any mobs that go over this limit. The hope is that this will reduce the load on the server and give everyone a more enjoyable experience. Note that this doesn't make experience grinders completely ineffective, it just means you'll have to actually kill them as they spawn rather than idling waiting for them to build up.

I'm working on other ways to get profiling data from the server and fix performance issues in both the server and our plugins.

1324601173.0,31,self.mcpublic,nnbhg,[PvE] Rules Update - Effective Immediately,36,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/nnbhg/pve_rules_update_effective_immediately/,"Hi everyone, I've updated the PvE rules on the [wiki](http://redditpublic.com). These changes are mainly putting in writing some long standing (unwritten) policies on the server. There are no changes to already established rules or policies. 

I'll post all the new parts below, [visit the wiki](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Rules) to see the complete list of rules. 

---------

Updates to PvE common rules:

* Be a good neighbor, give other people some space. The map is huge, don’t build right up against other people’s structures unless the area is very crowded. Buildings that violate this rule may be moved to a new location without warning. 

* Any building scaffolding or access structures such as tard towers (towers that are only a single block wide) should be removed when no longer necessary. Permanent scaffolding or tard towers are frowned upon and may be removed by staff. Long-incomplete structures that are in the way may be removed at the discretion of server admins. 

* Be respectful of the map and do not mar the experience or view for other players. Certain “very low quality” structures including but not limited to cobble/netherrack boxes and floating skyrails may be removed if they significantly impact the surrounding area in a negative way. Such removal will be done entirely at the discretion of server admins. 

* The map should be considered open for exploration. Players are not allowed to completely block off large sections of the map. Access to land and buildings should not be ""restricted"". Anything can be explored by anyone. Rare exceptions include structures such as private animal farms.

---------

Clarifications regarding the Nether/End

* All server rules still apply in the Nether and End. 

* The End should be considered volatile and could be reset at any time. Don’t store blocks or items in the End that you don’t want to lose. 

* The Nether may be reset from time to time. We will try to give several days’ notice before a Nether reset, but this is not guaranteed. In general, don’t store blocks or items in the Nether that you don’t want to lose.

* Due to the possibility of resets, we will not protect builds in the Nether/End. Exceptions include spawners.

--------

Clarifications regarding protections

* Protections serve two distinct purposes:
* (1)To prevent unauthorized edits to player made structures and other builds (this includes strongholds and NPC villages significantly improved or worked on by the player). 
* (2)To control the development of a town or city

* Protections are not used for “claiming land.” Mods will only protect builds (houses, rail, farms, ect) and clearly established cities. Requests to protect empty land or to protect a very large buffer around a structure will be denied.

* Protections generally will cover the entire area above a structure (to sky limit) and about 10 blocks below the lowest floor.
* We will not protect to bedrock unless your structure extends down that far. Underground resources are considered to be public property. Mines, drop shafts, ect, will not be protected.

We are thinking of doing this: Create a snapshot of the server and host it elsewhere without build privileges. It will be for people to take pics/document the creations for a few days. This would be alongside a reset for the main server.

Rest assured we haven't been ignoring everyone and sitting around doing nothing.  There have been quite a few of these changes already on our todo list that got a bit side tracked due to some staffing changes.  We're doing our best to fill in the gaps and keep things progressing along.  

I do want to make it clear we are not attempting to completely change minecraft.  What we ARE trying to do is encourage pvp by making competitive level gear easier to get and more rewarding to use.  As of right now there are no huge changes to the game; instead there are fairly large tweaks that we feel will help in that regard. 

These will be going live in the coming days.  I will make another post when they do.  I just figured we'd throw it all out there before hand to give everyone the heads up. 


* We will be reintroducing XP plumping.  Everything will drop 2-3x more XP than it does right now (we're not sure on exact numbers yet...).  This will make obvious effects by halving or thirding the time it takes to get your XP to level 30.  

* C45Y will be implementing an unenchant command.  Hold the item in your hand you want unenchanted and type /unenchant into the chat box.  

* C45Y also made it so enderpearls will now always do 2.5 hearts of damage no matter what armor you're wearing.  This is to discourage (or make it impossible in some cases) to pearl away from fights or spam pearls in all directions.  It doesn't remove pearling, but it makes it far more strategic. 

* Yours truly implemented a glicko2 (www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf) rating system for survival seeded with every kill from the revision and updated pseudo live, every 4 hours (due to the algorithm requiring quite a few 'battles' calculated at once).  This gives us an Armor rank, No Armor rank, and All kills rank for each player.  C45Y has built a very nice sortable leaderboard with that data and some additional goodies that will be put onto nerd.nu.  


There are some additional things we'd like to do as well, but we feel these are a pretty hefty start and should make things quite a bit easier to manage.  They'll cut enchanting times down dramatically and completely remove wasted diamonds with 'crap enchants.'

Here's the start, and feel free to add more.

1)  Friendly animals are almost non-existent outside of ranching.  Don't expect a supply of wild chickens to stave off your hunger.  Get some seeds, some wood for a hoe, and find a water supply to set up a farm next to.  In PvE, man can and frequently does live off of bread alone.

2)  On the subject of wood, after chopping down a tree make sure to  get the saplings.  Use one to replant the tree.  The rest  can be used to turn a non-productive plain into a wood supply.

3)  PvE is a sort of civilized Minecraft.  A fair share of the world is lit at night, making it much easier to avoid mob swarms.  Use the light and dark to your advantage for pursuing or avoiding mobs as you trek across the frontier.

4)  Skeletons and spiders are now your hunting prey of choice.  Spiders drop string which makes wool at a ratio of 4:1, as well as bows.  Skeletons drop arrows (the only way to get them without chickens) and bones.  One bone = 3 bonemeal = 3 instant wheat = 1 bread.  Grind them bones to make your bread.  If you're not up to fighting skels, wait until a bit after sunrise and harvest the remains.

5)  Creepers won't break stuff, but they can still kill you and kill other mobs.  Don't let the lack of craters fool you.

6)  If you set up house near other people, don't expect to mine down into a pristine chunk of stone.  The best mine potential will be far away from as many people as possible.  If you do hit someone else's tunnel while mining, be careful.  Wandering around unknown tunnels is a good way to get lost/burned/exploded, and you shouldn't be mining out their stuff anyway.",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_n6fgp,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/n6fgp/pve_newbie_tips_for_surviving_alone/,

Although I am active in the community, I do not speak a lot or a lot of interaction with people. However, despite this I keep anomyous order to avoid reprisals.

I have downloaded the latest survival map and decided to poke around. To go based on other people and see what they in their chest. However, in doing so, I've found a lot of people with very questionable content.

One of the most top players have two big boxes full diamond armor. 54 * 2 = 108 and an average of six diamonds of all armor peices, that would be 216 diamonds. I thought that maybe this person has played a lot and just taken the spoils of other people, but they have zero armor damage to them! A second player (unknown who) had a pile of grass blocks.

I also found two mods that a similar case in their chest. If one has more than 25 piles of pumpkins (25 * 64 = many). I do not think it possible to collect that many in the alloted space. A second mod was a pile of diamond blocks, several piles of iron blocks, and the chest filled with the pig saddles. I do not think this is possible.

We have too many mobs and too much stuff on the ground. 

To put things into perspective, S usually has around 2,000 mobs (hostile and passive) during high traffic times. By comparison, PvE often has over 12,000 mobs plus 2000+ items on the ground. It's just too much for the server to deal with. This is the main limiting factor with regards to lag (ticks per second) and player capacity. 

In the interest of (hopefully) getting more people on the server and in drastically improving performance we're implementing a hard cap on the number of mobs allowed to exist. PvE will now be capped at 3000 total mobs, about half of that allocation being for sheep. Some of the habits and play styles we've developed over the past few revs just aren't sustainable. These massive animal farms and grinders are killing the server. It sucks, but this is necessary. 

After the cap was implemented we saw a massive increase in performance. We went from 9 ticks per second at 50 people to 20 ticks per second. We need to keep watching to see how things look when the server is maxed at 80. If the performance improvements hold we will be able to increase the player cap. 

**Edit:** After additional testing, I'm happy to say that we're still running at 20 ticks per second (aka full speed) with around 80 people on. As a result, we've increased the cap to 100. If the gains hold we can go higher. Additionally you'll notice that rail is smooth, leaves decay quickly, crops grow fast, ect

Even with cap limitations, they still cause massive lag - When generating the map, I hadn't the time to double check some of the defaults like clay ores and cave rarity and for this I am very sorry. I was spending a lot of time generating maps, trying many many different settings until I could get something interesting, but not so intense like PVE1, 3, and 4. Again, sorry to be ""that guy"". You may throw eggs at me in game.

I hope you all are enjoying something different from vanilla; almost everyone seems to like it for what it is and I'm glad we'll have at least this map different from vanilla even if this process is vetoed in the future. I would like to make the best of this opportunity...

Solution?!
If we all go under the most popular areas, cities, and our own homes and light up all the caves, we might really kill off mob spawn in a big way. It is a lot of work, I know, but please consider the long term effects of lighting up all the things. This process requires that you do a few different levels of work, finding caves low and high, and maintaining a sense of direction so that one might find their way back. I've found that minimap helps a lot. I think we can make a difference if we try - if everyone spent a few hours into just placing torches underground, we might save ourselves a lot of time in the future from lag reduction and help grinder builders. I'll be hitting Pico, Argoth, spawn, and some other places soon with many many torches.",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_qa29c,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/qa29c/pve_lag_issue_a_statement_semisolution/,

Just wanted to give you all a heads up on where we are with map building, and make another opportunity for community input. In our [last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/15poj6/feedback_thread_for_pve/), we covered a fair few big ideas, and now we're looking for more! We saw that there were a good few people who liked the floating islands, but many preferred the more realistic World Painter terrain. The current plan for next rev is to have the map be a [circle within a square](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8dq-qZO-K1Y/UHwgqZLSIkI/AAAAAAAAALM/9GYCCnAV8Fk/s1600/circleSquare.png), as opposed to the square in a square that we did this rev (this means more WP, less TC). The center circle would have a variety of World Painter built terrain, while the outer corners would have a mix of Terrain Control and hand-built places. 

World Painter lends itself to more realistic landscapes, and while we certainly have loads of ideas, we'd like to hear what kinds of areas the players would like to see in their map. Nearly anything is possible, and I relish the challenge! I've been going off of the [wiki list of landforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landforms) for ideas, but is there anything in particular (fjords, mesas, volcanoes, canyons, ect.) you would like to see on the map?

 * Overworld Nether Portal Placements
 * Spawn Nether Portal Placements
 * Spawn Station Placements
 * Rule Board Placements
 * World Painted Terrain
 * Terrain Control Terrain
 * Using Multiple Terrain Editors in the Same Map

1353149850.0,27,self.mcpublic,13cisa,"It’s time to tone down Survival chat - how we’re enforcing chat rules, and a reminder that harassment is never okay.",35,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/13cisa/its_time_to_tone_down_survival_chat_how_were/,"So we need to talk about the chat situation on S.

Historically, we've been fairly loose in the degree of trash talk and taunting that is tolerated on the Survival server. This is not because we want the server to be a negative place, but because this kind of talk is inevitable on a heated, competitive server. We largely want players to resolve these kinds of disputes on their own, within the existing gameplay (though we actively discourage public accusations, instead asking users to /modreq like always).

That said, the taunting, harassment, and otherwise toxic behavior by some players, in-game and elsewhere, has gotten disappointingly out of hand the past few weeks. For example, we’ve had to remove S from nerd.nu/modreq for now because players were repeatedly using it to criticize other users for modreqs either made or directed at them.  C’mon guys, it’s ridiculous that we have to do this to protect players reporting issues.

It’s unfortunate, because we don’t want to inadvertently limit reasonable trash talk - it’s fun, and part of what survival is.  But when I see so many players getting so upset over what’s happening in chat, it’s clear that we need to shift the enforcement line.  So we're going to take the following steps to nip this in the bud right now:

* We are not in the business of protecting players' alt accounts - but if a player has made it clear that they don't want their alt accounts publicized, then you need to respect that. **Taunting players with the names of their alt accounts**, particularly if those players have made it clear that they are uncomfortable with this, **is out of line and will be treated as harassment.** I don't care whether the players in question are mods or not.
* Moving forward, staff will be more proactive in removing accusations, personal attacks, excessive trash talk/taunting/trolling (regardless of who started it), and otherwise spammy behavior. Consequences may be issued after the fact. “They were trolling/harassing me worse!” is **never an appropriate justification for your actions**.
* Attempting to manufacture work for staff, whether through false modreqs, ""fake"" rule violations, or similar behavior, may lead to bans without warning.
* In general - if something you have said has made someone uncomfortable and they have asked you to stop, then just **stop**. This is not hard. We will remove players who are clearly and intentionally persisting in this kind of behavior. It's harassment.

If you have an issue with another player, /modreq or talk to a mod/admin. If you have an issue with the actions of a mod, take it to an admin immediately. Harassing the players involved in chat or elsewhere is not an appropriate response.

I hope that users will listen to these requests and take them seriously.  Finally, just wanted to say how much we do appreciate those users who contribute to making Survival a friendly place, for whom this is never a problem.  Thanks for making this a fun place to play!",Survival,False,,t5_2s52h,False,survival,,True,t3_13cisa,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/13cisa/its_time_to_tone_down_survival_chat_how_were/,moderator

For though it is always our goal to keep the experience on our servers as close to vanilla as possible, this is most certainly not SSP and we simply cannot continue to run at the number of mobs were do now. 

---

Some farms have already been reduced in number, those of you who have been contacted, please refrain from breeding them back to their previous sizes. For people looking for rough numbers to judge their own farms by, try to keep the total number of mobs below 20. If your farm has currently less than 20 mobs in it, please remain at that number, don't breed up to the limit. A good rule of thumb would be to keep one or two breeding pairs of pigs, sheep, cows and chickens, and then breed as your projects demand, but before you log off, kill the excess mobs to return to the bare minimum. As for towns and cities, please try to keep your farms to the lowest breed-able numbers as well.

---

The amount that we are plumping drops is not yet set in stone, as we will be monitoring the number of mobs on the server and trying to find ways to encourage players to voluntarily reduce their farms. Hopefully, we can all cinch our waistbands together, and not have to resort to a mob cap in order to have a stable server. :D


As always, msg or mail the admins if you have any questions, and if you come across a farm you think we should have a look at, please make a modreq :)

The current rules were written by many different people over a period of many months. We've edited the text to remove redundant information and to provide a more consistent writing style. It's also about 300 words shorter. 

For the most part, the rules themselves are the same. There are only 3 policy changes included with this edit:

-**Clarification on PVP**: Basically, PVP arenas will be allowed. Nothing else. If you want anything more than the most basic bare bones PVP experience, head over to S.   

-**Property disputes with expanding cities/projects**: Detailed clarification of current policy: (1)try to avoid the conflict, (2)try to talk it out, (3)if no solution is found get a mod to mediate. 

-**The End**: Confirmation that we do not plan to reset the end during the course of any particular revision.

This post is so that everyone has a chance to look over and review these changes before they go live. Any questions, comments, or concerns are welcome. 

-------------------------------

Revised PvE Rules:

**General**

-All MCPublic universal rules still apply.

-No killing or trapping other players in any manner except in clearly marked PVP arenas. Only reasonably sized arena style (think spleef arena) builds are eligible to have PVP enabled. Enabling PVP will be done on case by case basis, entirely at the discretion of server admins.

-Do not leave large numbers of items on the ground from mining, farms, grinders, ect. This is detrimental to the performance and stability of the server.

-The map should be considered open for exploration. Players are not allowed to completely block off large sections of the map. Access to land and buildings should not be ""restricted"". Anything can be explored by anyone. Rare exceptions include structures such as private animal farms.


**Structures**

-Don’t build very close to other players’ structures, be sure to leave some space. Buildings that violate this rule may be moved to a new location without warning.

-If you have a large project such as a city or megabuild, expand in directions that do not come into conflict with other players. Exhaust all available unopposed routes before expanding near already established players. If you must expand in the vicinity of other players, speak with them first to see if they are willing to participate in your project. Leave signs, /mail, or /msg them in chat. If you are unable to come to an agreement, contact a moderator for assistance.

-Scaffolding, 1x1 towers, and other temporary builds should be removed as soon as no longer needed. Such structures may be removed by moderators at any time. 

-Be respectful of the map and do not mar the experience or view for other players. Certain “very low quality” structures including but not limited to cobble/netherrack boxes, floating skyrails, and abandoned incomplete builds may be removed if they significantly impact the surrounding area in a negative way. Such removal will be done entirely at the discretion of server admins. 


**Nether/End**

-All server rules still apply in the Nether and End.

-The End should be considered stable and will likely not be reset during any particular map revision.

-The Nether should be considered stable and will likely not be reset during any particular map revision.


**Protections**


-Protections exist solely to prevent grief and other unauthorized edits.

-Protections are not used for “claiming land.” Mods will only protect builds (houses, rail, farms, ect) and clearly established large projects such as cities. Requests to protect empty land or to protect a very large buffer around a structure will be denied.

-Protections generally will cover the entire area above a structure (to sky limit) and about 10 blocks below the lowest floor.
-We will not protect to bedrock unless your structure extends down that far. Underground resources are considered to be public property. Mines, drop shafts, ect, will not be protected.


**Banned Items**

-TNT (mods will not place)

-Flint and Steel
-Make a /modreq to request fire

-Water and lava buckets only place static liquid. If you need water or lava made to flow, or fire placed please make a /modreq.
Mods and Admins reserve the right to deny flowing water or lava.

-Redstone mechanisms, dispensers, and pistons may be removed at moderator discretion; abuse of these (lag inducing, player traps, etc) may result in a ban

-Portals
-Players may not build or light portals. Official portals are provided at spawn and in the wilderness.",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_tmkzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/tmkzi/revised_pve_rules/,moderator

I've been around in this community for almost two years now.

I'm a pretty old hand, and I've watched these servers rise from a tiny 10-slot SMP server hosted in a 16-year-old's bedroom, to a 3-server, 100-slot-per-server monolith of the minecraft community, hosted on a pretty expensive dedicated server.

I would like to stress that for once I am not trolling, and I am being completely serious.

I have primarily been a survival player since the day Creative and Survival were split from the initial, simply ""SMP"" server. I enjoy murdering people. It is most amusing to me when people complain about my killing them. As I frequently comment, their tears sustain me.

However.

As of late, the experience on the Survival server has been rapidly decreasing in quality. 

I've posted my often rude and offensive opinions on as to why this is to multiple people, but I'll be honest here.

The true reason for survival being boring is because we scare everybody away.

The survival crowd has ended up whittled down to a small bunch of regular players, all of whom know each other, and hate each other passionately. 

Mumble, for instance- The survival channel completely died when the Wolfpack decided to start using a different mumble so that we could make plans without being listened to, and (the real reason), so that we could make obscene jokes without fear of reprimand. This was to the point that Alansmithee came on our mumble and asked us to come back, because ""mumble was completely deserted without us"". 

Most are killed, get angry, and then quit, to another server. The type of server Survival is, it is very unwelcoming for a newbie. There is flat out no solution to that- We can't implement PvE zones, that just won't work, and you can't change the temperment of the core playerbase.

Rather than more moderation, I believe survival needs less moderation, and less restrictions. 

A breath of fresh air.

I'd like to suggest, first off, that we either clearly define what it is to be logging in PvP, or completely remove the rule altogether.

Hear me out, now, and I will justify the removal of the rule- I know it'll be an unpopular opinion, and not necessarily one that I fully support myself.

PvP logging is something that is nearly impossible to detect. You can't tell whether or not somebody did it intentionally or not, especially with the instability of the 1.2.3 client, with invincibility glitches, frequent crashes, etc etc. 

Should a mod or administrator be (unfortunately for you) watching you PvP log, you are banned.

But this isn't fair to those who are caught, because there are countless more who go about and do not get caught for it. Frequently as of this release you have to flat out close the game in combat, because you are getting roughly one frame per minute. 

You're wearing full diamond, and somebody else in full diamond is fighting you. Suddenly, your client freezes up (as 1.2.3 has been fraught to do), and you decide to end the java task. Is that PvP logging?

You're wearing full diamond, and somebody is attempting to punch you to death whilst wearing nothing, however they have the invulnerability glitch that makes your client refuse to acknowledge them as a entity, and thus you are unable to damage them, and you log out- Is that PvP logging?

You're wearing full diamond, and somebody is attempting to stone sword you to death whilst wearing nothing, and NoCheat is being funky with player movement, and you are unable to hit him, so you log out- Is that PvP logging?

I would assume that the answer most of you would give for the first three examples would be No, No and Yes (At least, that's what I would answer). 

But how does one prove any of these things? There isn't really a discernable way (unless the logs show that you closed the java process through a different disconnect reason, I am unsure) to discern these sorts of things. 

I tenatively suggest that the logging policy be dropped completely until such a time as we have ways to prevent these glitches, or at least ways of detecting them.

Here's why I feel no alternative will work:

If we give moderators the ability to ban for PvP logging, something that is extraordinarily volatile, we could (and doubtless will) see somebody eventually be banned simply because a moderator does not like them. This will, of course, cause a huge amount of drama and bring the entire logging policy into question once more. 

Administrators, as I stated above, cannot have that sole power- There are not enough administrators for that to work. It's silly to suggest that it could work.

C45Y's log-trawling plugin that alerts whenever somebody logs during PvP does not remove any of the issues I stated above.

I would very much appreciate discussion on this particular point, because I have put a lot of thought into a PvP logging policy that would work, and simply cannot come up with one that, when viewed critically, would work.

My second point is in relation to NoCheat.

NoCheat provides an invaluable service to these servers, in that it detects the most common of hacks- Forcefields, Flyhacks, Nodamage, et cetera.

However, I believe that at first, the Survival server was put up without anti-forcefield on, and -aside from the blatant forcefielders, who will plague survival regardless of NoCheat's presence- there was very little difference in the amount of hackers.

However, one thing that there definately was a huge difference in, was the amount of PvP-related lag.

I experienced a similar thing on the Chaos map, when NoCheat was disabled, and it was simply glorious. For the first time the entire revision, I could reliably hit people, and contrary to the claims that the server ""runs at 20 ticks with or without NoCheat"" and that ""extensive stress testing had been done on the matter"", once NoCheat was re-enabled, PvP went back to being nigh-unplayable. 

I made a point similar to this to Amaranth, and I think the exact line I recieved was ""The day NoCheat leaves our servers is that day I do. This is non-negotiable.""

There was absolutely no consideration given to the possibility of alternatives- something that is very, very foolish, and if it goes unrevised, could end up killing the survival server.

That is not, of course, to say I don't appreciate what Amaranthus does for our servers. He's a great tech admin and the servers have improved leaps and bounds in size since he joined the technical administration team. However, I would like to take the opportunity to pose a question: Why should somebody who does not play on the server be making arbitary and gameplay-changing decisions about the server (for another example of this, see the debacle about disenchanting weapons using forges).

It's really those sorts of things that should be put to the community to decide, rather than being arbitarily decided by a single person who barely even plays the game in the first place. It influences and affects the gameplay of everybody who plays on the nerd servers (and, in the case of the disenchanting, everybody who plays using craftbukkit!)

Survival without PvP is like.. I don't know, Creative without the ability to give oneself blocks? It ruins the purpose of the server itself- The server is for killing people. If you can't kill people because of a plugin, removing or fixing that plugin should be the top priority in terms of the server. 

My third, is the short and simple suggestion of more events.

Some will disagree with me. I in part disagree with myself, as Survival is not supposed to be a lovely friendly community with competitions and honour and the rest of that bullshit. However, it is undeniable that centralised tournaments and competitions make the game more fun to play. 

I feel that we need more of that, to pour a tad of the old War servers into Survival to give it a bit more life, because Survival certainly is not alive right now. 

My fourth and last point, is clans.

Clans are both a boon and a curse to any server.

They unite the server against a common enemy at their best- Or they dominate the entire server and ruin it for everybody else at their worst.

I have no adequete suggestion for how to deal with clans- In reality, there is no way. You can't force people not to group together. I'm quite aware of this, I did start the Mumble Clan, Team Britain and now the Wolfpack.

The last two revisions have been rather terrible- In part because of NoCheat, but also because of the resurgence of dominance of clans (Team Britain ruled 1.8, Roastnewt's clan effectively ruled 1.0, Usurp ruled 1.1 and now it seems that the Wolfpack, assuming they do not all get banned, will dominate 1.2)

Rather than discouraging clan behaviour, why not encourage the formation of coalitions against whichever clan seems to be the most powerful at the time? 

Why not work clans into events? Clan-based arenas and the like could be really very fun. 

A conclusion.

I don't really appear to be saying anything of use on the topic of clans, but still- It's something that deserves consideration, because at the moment, Survival is stagnating. It's becoming progressively less and less fun, and I've had almost twenty-five people come to me with the suggestion of us starting our own servers and running them how we see fit. 

I don't think s.nerd.nu is beyond redemption just yet. I'd bloody well like to at least try to haul it out of the slump it seems to be in, but many notables from the community have suggested this to me, and the general spirit seems to be one of discontent. 

I've done my best to verbalize my thoughts in a non-trolly manner, and I certainly hope that I will, for a change, be taken seriously, rather than being shrugged off as ""eh, he's trolling"" once again.

Oh, and as a little final thing, I'd also like to suggest that we nerf or outright disable poison potions. They are obscenely strong and destroy the entire PvP mechanic, which is silly.

I'm also fairly certain that Bromgoth, Pico and Seneca will also want ones, as these were the portal cities for rev 10. There is also Wellspring, Lothos and others. This is not to say that the portals are for these cities and these cities only, but rather that historically (past 3 revs) these cities have had them.

Lets keep in mind that there are also end portals and secret portals (although the latter can't really be ""rushed"" for).

So, what portal does your city plan on rushing for? Are you looking for specific terrain, or just a fixed direction?

Discuss!

**UPDATE:**

Here's what's I've gathered from this thread. I'd encourage towns interested in the same portal to open a discussion amongst themselves.

**SW**

* Seneca

**NW**

* Port Aperture (?)

**SE**

* Pico (?)

**NE**

* ??

**Secret Portals**

* Walla-Walla
* Shroomville

**End Portals**

* Deerside
* Lothos

**No Portal**

* Argoth (?)
* Atlantis
* Brom
* Burgeth

We've tried some things to bring some players back (XP plump, rankings, pearl changes, beer).  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have been quite enough.  

In the opinion of the S admin staff, minecraft PVP is broken.  We want to change it drastically (to make it more fun and rewarding) and want to know your opinions on our proposed changes or any changes you may have thought of that we haven't.  

* New, old style map layout (centralized spawn, roads, portals at obvious locations, pre-built up nether for fast travel).  The warps were fun for a bit, not so fun anymore... We need the insane compact users of yesteryear. 

* Remove enchants on Armor and Weapons.  Bringing us somewhat closer to the glory days of minecraft beta where everyone was on relatively equal footing gear wise, skill mattered, and you left with a useable full kit from the bad guy.  You could mine for an hour and have an entire pvp kit with dsword and iron armor and compete.  
  
* Make food also heal.  Lets face it, hunger is stupid for pvp.  It's great for the adventure game so we don't want to remove it, but having food also insta pop your health up should be a nice addition to PVP.  This may or may not include removing the eat animation?  Not sure that's in feasible.  

* Remove villagers (we wanted to remove just some trades, but that doesn't seem possible tech wise).  This removes the infinite diamond gear as we saw during this revision.  Obvious broken game mechanic for PVP. 

* Removing enchants on PVP gear will also force us to re balance or remove potions depending on how strong they become.  Also golden apples... :)


SO!  let us know right here what you think or have come up with.  

also... we're going to be resetting end of this week for a fairly short pre 1.4 map.  Most of these changes are probably going to have to wait until the 1.4 rev though...",Survival,False,,t5_2s52h,False,survival,,True,t3_10tnew,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/10tnew/official_survival_feedback_thread_of_glory/,moderator

Here's the post with details on the rest of the 1.3 features.

Remember:

* Nothing here is permanent. We're taking a wait-and-see attitude with many of the 1.3 changes to see how they work on a large server. Please bear with us until we can try them out (at which point feedback will be much appreciated!).

----

**The Planned Changes** (part 2)

* As noted in Part 1, we're changing **minecarts** on S and P to behave just like boats - like vanilla, but with any unoccupied entities being removed from the map every 5 minutes. However, to make sure you don't accidentally lose minecarts, any removed minecarts will leave drops behind, rather than just disappearing.
* **Dispensers**: On S and P, dispensers will be able to dispense minecarts and boats, exactly as in vanilla. They will also be able to inhale/exhale water and lava, but this water/lava will be non-flowing, just like water/lava buckets now. On C, we're still working out what to do with dispensers - they're still banned for now, but there are a lot of creative ways to use them now with 1.3, so we'll be looking into options for potentially unbanning them.
* **Written Books**: Allowed. Remember, our usual chat/language rules still apply - no hate speech, keep it civil.

Let me know if we missed anything, or if you have any other last minute questions before our new revisions start going up. P is [ready to roll](http://redd.it/xz1ey), and S and C won't be far behind (if they're behind at all ;)!

However, the current state of affairs is that with PvP on, Minecraft turned into yet another FPS. A pack of griefers and trolls in a killing spree murdering anyone barely trying to get anything done, or even start at the server. The thing is, if I had wanted an FPS, I wouldn't have been playing Minecraft (instead I would have got one of the 3478023752 FPS released for Xbox 360 on a monthly basis). In my opinion, **Minecraft** should be about **mining** and **crafting**, not about PKing the heck about everyone.

This is why I propose to disable PvP and turn the survival server into a truly cooperative, constructive experience in the best Reddit spirit (it's, after all, the Reddit server, not the 4chan server), or create another service for this kind of experience.

I've talked to many players in creative who were in the same position as I am: they wanted the survival server for increased building comradeship and fighting against the world hazards together, but found the PvP feature a total deal breaker.

As some of you may know, lately the staff have been working on assembling an official McPublic youtube channel.  The channel is now up and running, but we have encountered a bit of a problem...

**We need videos!**

As of now, the channel has absolutely no video to it's name, thus making it quite a pathetic channel.  This is why we are looking to you for help.  Starting today, we will be accepting video submissions from any player.  

**What we are looking for:**

Obviously, if at all possible we would prefer that you submit high-quality, well rendered videos.  We are open to all kinds of videos, so we are leaving the content up to you.  Recorded a particularly interesting arena battle?  Submit it!  Want to show off your PVE city?  Sumbit it!  Want to create a timeline of Dome6?  Submit it!  We have no preference what is contained in the video, as long as it is well-made and follows all the rules of the server.

**How do I submit a video?**

To submit a video, you may simply send the video file to myself (tacodude3), buzzinbee, or JohnAdams1735.  We will screen the video to make sure it fits all of the aforementioned guidelines, and it will go through an approval process.  Once it has been approved, we will notify you, and it will be uploaded.  So what are you waiting for?  We can't wait to see your videos.

[Subscribe to the channel to keep in touch here!](http://www.youtube.com/user/MCPublicServers)

there is a glitch that if you place a mob head in a protected region.they dupe.Because of this everyone decided to make withers.
For this reason, heads are probably going to be banned.

1347250404.0,28,self.mcpublic,zmys1,Reviving Survival,35,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/zmys1/reviving_survival/,"This revision and the last have been deprived of pvp, and we as a community need to come up with ways to increase competition and make people want to pvp. I have a few suggestions on how to make our survival server more competitive, please let me know what you think of these suggestions and feel free to tell me some of your own.

1) The maps now are too spread out, we need to make the new revisions centralized. Two revisions ago there were the nether portals that were almost right next to each other that made it easy to get around and find a player you needed/wanted to kill. Warps are something I haven't cared much for though when you put together a nice clean nether like there was in revision 15 I feel there can be a lot more pvp.

2) Some sort of PvP rating system, I feel if we had this PvP rating system players would strive to be on the top, or the leader boards. The rating system would know when a player was killed in a certain type of armor and the enchant (if possible) and what the players pvp rating/rank is and give the player who killed them x amount of rating because they killed that player in diamond armor. Also a players specific pvp page or just server page would have their highest kill streak, k/d ratio, favorite weapon, clan, and anything else you could imagine that has to do with pvp (suggestions appreciated) I know doing these things would be a challenge for our tech team, but I believe they could do it and it should be a priority, somethings could be exploited but players who would exploit it would be punished. (Barneygale inspired)

3) Now, we know that arena night brings around a lot of people, right? Why? Because people are given unobtainable items, for example I got cow eggs and pig eggs from the last arena. Using this rating system players should be able to obtain these items causing them to want to knock off the top players, to be the top and get these items. If say nyislanders2121 was the top pvper and was the top rated pvper for one week he would get x prize, if we could keep that title for another week he would get a different prize etcetera. I don't know about you but if there was a way I could obtain these items I would without a doubt want to try and get these items, another prize could be a sharpness V sword or protection V armor, though that might be getting a little too extreme. (Barneygale inspired)

4) Bounties using said rating system we could set up a true bounty system where players could offer iron or diamonds for knocking a player off the number one spot or number two spot. It would be a way for players in the number two spot or below to have a chance at getting to number one spot since everyone will want to kill that player for the bounty. This wouldn't require killing him just once, it would require killing him while he is in diamond because he would lose more rating that way 

5) Clans, clans are a big part of survival. There could be a way of incorporating these clans into the rating system, the average of all ratings in a players clan would be the clans rating. It would work much like the individual stats. The top clan would get just like an individual would, it was suggested that clans be able to open up other clans chests for a limited amount of time, but I feel that would not fly on survival. Also there would be a way from in game to see which clans are accepting members at that time. But, creating a clan would have to be done from the nerd.nu website.  (Barneygale inspired)

6) Buff experience again! Players would not have to sit at their grinders for anywhere near as long in rev 15 because of the XP buff, and they were almost guaranteed a good enchant on armor because it was at level 50, but now the enchants are worse there and there is no XP buff which makes grinding a pain again. Sure the enchantments are capped at 30 now, but at what cost? Players spend more time than ever on grinding because of the new max level. Not only should we buff experience for mining, but buffing experience dropped from players would be great also again, more reward for killing other players.

7) Enderpearls, this one is controversial. Some suggest rid of them completely, personally I think that is too extreme since enderpearls are still a huge part of pvp. I think it was declared that in future revs, revs past 17, the end would be free game, chaos. This is great because there will not be any endgrinders since they would get griefed to hell, therefore causing enderpearls to be more rare. Another great suggestion was brought to mind not too long ago in another post, have enderpearls even with full port IV armor take away 2.5 hearts, basically no absorption of four pearls and your dead without regeneration and health potions. Link to the enderpearl suggestion post: http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/zjtst/a_wall_of_text_about_mcpublic_survival_and/

8) Logging, logging has been a huge problem on survival I know that we have warnings for people who log but, it would be great if we had a plugin that either took away login invulnerability and or left a ghost there for a couple seconds and if the ghost was hit, it would stay until not hit for x amount of seconds.

All these things will require a lot of work and time from the tech admins, but I do believe it can be done and will improve survival greatly. These things could bring survival back from the dead. Again please post your own suggestions and whether you agree or disagree with my ideas, also please elaborate why you do not agree with my ideas. These suggestions come from regular survival players not just myself, even though I use me and I, it is a collaboration of many.",Survival,False,,t5_2s52h,1347315412.0,survival,,True,t3_zmys1,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/zmys1/reviving_survival/,

PVE 6 is about to turn three months old. This has been an amazing map and is by far the longest lived we’ve ever had. However, the map is showing its age. We need some new challenges, a new pristine wilderness to burn and plunder. A new Eden to call our own. 

Therefore, on Sunday we will be resetting the PVE server. That means that the current map will end and we will start up on a completely new one. For our new players that may not be familiar with the practice, this is something we do every couple of months. A new map means a clean, fresh start for all players. No inventory, chests, or anything else will be carried over from the current map. 

For this next map we are planning to go back to PVE’s roots. Back in the day, when PVE was formed during Survival’s Great Carebear Exodus, it was decided that without PVP to provide a challenge the terrain would have to be interesting and more difficult to traverse. Until revision 5 PVE used maps with special terrain, and each map had a unique and memorable feel to its land. Since 1.8 came out we’ve been trying vanilla terrain, but to be honest, it’s got boring. All the maps look like plain variations of the same thing. 

This time around, barring any last minute technical complications, we’re going to bring back that special terrain. We’ve got great settings that will make exploring and building very fun and interesting to say the least. For our old school people, nothing nearly as crazy as PVE 1, 3, or 4.

Teasers: [1](http://i.imgur.com/5gYZj.jpg)  [2](http://i.imgur.com/4aRO7.jpg)

I know there will be some questions, I’ll answer now:

*“Why reset now, why not wait until 1.2? What about jungles and cats?”*

- **In an ideal world we would have waited for 1.2. To be honest, we’ve been ready to go for a few weeks, but we’ve held back, waiting for news on the update. There’s still no set date and the map is too old as it is. I can smell the mothballs from here. We won’t have jungles. However, the new terrain has some interesting features that will more than make up for it. As far as cats go, we’ll have a trade sign at spawn for them.**

*“Can I keep my inv/house/chests?”*

- **No. We all start fresh and clean.**

*“Can I get a copy of the map?”*

You'll notice when you look at these that all the newish blocks have not been rendered, this is due to me being stuck with using a mapping program that is a little outdated. I'll compile the latest source in a bit and see if they've fixed this. As they are these cartos should still give you an idea of what's been built and where things are though.

",33,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/mp0pl/pve_please_reconsider_plans_for_home_heres_why/,"When I first heard that the mods were considering changing ""/home"" so that it would only work from spawn, I was okay with it, until I ended up in a situation where I needed it. 

Allow me to explain: I was exploring an underground abandoned mine, when the server crashed on me.  When I re-joined the server, I was placed above my position; not in my exact position in the cave.  

The problem with that was that ""above my position"" turned out to be on the bottom of a very deep lake - a lake we had paved over when we terraformed Pico. 

Without ""/home"" I would have lost all my tools, my ores, and my rail, through no fault of my own.  

I understand that the idea behind ""/home"" restriction was so that people would have to live with the consequences of falling into lava or getting lost underground.  But without ""/home,"" we lose a way to recover from bad situations that the server puts us in through bugs as well. 

I would be happy with a compromize where you were only allowed to use ""/home"" once in every 24 hours, in the case of emergency.

The time has come for us to take a bold step forward into the future. We can no longer follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and trudge from city to city on foot. In this modern age, why should anybody be forced to walk long, dangerous, and confusing roads? With a united PVE rail system, we can join our cities and become a more united, more powerful, and more prosperous world. 

We already have a rudimentary rail system that centers on the spawn terminal. From this location, 6 destinations can be reached. There are:

-Brom
-CityMaybe
-Airfree
-Pico
-Seneca
-West Portal

However, it would be wonderful if many more of our map's cities could easily be reached. Fortunately, the rail engineers and bureaucrats of Brom have dreamed up an elegant solution. 

Our main rail terminal, the Brom Land Terminal (or BLT), is now fully operational and ready to accept connections from around the map. 

[photo of station interior](http://i.imgur.com/ahwLc.jpg)

This massive facility is powered by the most advanced redstone technology known to man and is capable of managing arrivals and departures from 25 separate destinations. The brains of the operation is the collection of four BromTech Mark 9 Completely Automated Rail Transit System (CARTS) computers. 

[photo of CARTS computer](http://i.imgur.com/iRjj7.jpg)

Capable of performing an astonishing 1 operation per second, and boasting 1 bit of memory, these computers make it easy to get where you need to go. Each button can be programmed to deliver the rider to a specific destination, resulting in the fast, easy, and luxurious travel that the modern consumer so desires. 

[photo of CARTS computer interface](http://i.imgur.com/D3dNu.jpg)

The current plan is to start accepting connections to destinations located to the south and east of Brom. Locations north and west of the city will be added later. We will work on lines as we can, but the railroad builders of Brom are very busy, and progress will be slow. 

For that reason, we invite you to start digging your own rail tunnels. Get your line to the coordinates provided and we will take care of the last 200m or so of the final hookup. As more and more towns start to connect to the system, it will get more and more useful. Soon enough you will be able to reach any city or town on the map by taking a relaxing cart ride, with a brief stop in Brom to transfer. 

If you plan on making a rail connection to Brom, we recommend that you adhere to PVE Rails standard gauge construction: 3x3 tunnels located around y=20, with rail running on both sides of the tunnel and space for torches in the middle. Sticking to this standard of construction will make integrating the various systems very easy.

For locations east of Brom, please dig your tunnels to: -1230, 60, -30. There are 5 open destinations in this direction. 

For locations south of Brom, please dig your tunnels to: -1066, 56, 100. There are 4 open destinations in this direction.

I would like to hear from town and city mayors that would like to connect to the system so we can start to coordinate our efforts. Builders of awesome megaprojects are also welcome to connect to the system.

Mentally prepare yourself for the fact that it all might be gone this time next week. It's just part of the reality of playing an unfinished game.

* For the last Creative map reset, we had a [""future planning page""](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Creative_Future_Planning). *Go update it!* Put in your thoughts that have come up during this map version.

* [PVE has a planning page now too!](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/PVE_Future_Planning) Go fill it with ideas!

* If someone wants to set up a Survival future planning page, *do it!*

Now, keep in mind that a map reset is not *guaranteed* to happen, but wouldn't you rather have prepared for it and be expecting it than be totally surprised and disheartened because you weren't expecting it?

You guys rule.,29,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1jnrrv/its_like_christmas_morning_every_new_revision_you/,"I can tell you that I've been gaming for many years now. I used to raid endlessly in WoW, played RuneScape instead of doing middleschool work, and have pretty much gotten into any game under the sun. That being said, absolutely nothing compares to the adrenaline rush of the start of a new revision. 

Every start is filled with the most intense rush for land claims, portal rushes, people rushing stone swords to steal loot or defend their own, and just general pandemonium. It's honestly the perfect gaming scenario - dozens, if not over 100 people all sprinting about, trying to get started in this cruel world, with nothing but the skin on their character. Some form clans and support eachother, others become roving traders, and a dastardly few become fearsome raiders once communities are established.

The part about this community that I absolutely love is that you can do *anything* your heart desires. This comes with the guarantee that your hard work won't be destroyed, because of the ever-watching, hard-working moderators and admins. Got griefed? That person will be *punished* for their actions, something you rarely see on Minecraft servers these days. Afraid of pay-to-win? The only benefit of donating is keeping what is, in my opinion, the best server out there afloat. Not sets of Prot X diamond armor with a godsword for donators, just the guarantee that the place that you've made your home will remain there when you get back.

I always like to revisit older revisions before new ones start. I know it may not seem like awhile to you veterans, but I've been here since the beginning of revision 15, survival. Going back and seeing the places I once fought raiders, traded with other clans, and worked my way up simply cannot be matched by other servers. We have history that everyone who has been here can relate to.

That's why I'm making this post. No other server, game, or community gets me this pumped as does the ol' nerd.nu. When I saw the revision 22 anouncement, I went to work to request the two days following off. To sum this gooshy-gushy rant up:

This is a follow-up post to [this announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/11vuuz/announcement_all_servers_will_be_resetting_for_14/) earlier this week, where we noted that we'll be starting new revisions on all three of our main servers - c.nerd.nu, p.nerd.nu, and s.nerd.nu - once CraftBukkit and all our plugins are updated for this week's ~~1.4~~ 1.4.1 patch (now scheduled to happen [Thursday 10/25](http://mojang.com/2012/10/minecraft-1-4-1-pre-release/), **not** tomorrow).

We've talked to the techs and worked out a plan for transitioning to 1.4.1, so here it is!

* All three of our main servers (C/P/S) will remain on their current revision until *at least* when the 1.4.1 patch is released. Once the patch is out, we'll **continue running the current revisions on 1.3** on c.nerd.nu, p.nerd.nu, and s.nerd.nu - so **hang on to your 1.3 .jar** so you can connect! At some point each 1.3 server will be taken down, depending on (1) user activity/interest and (2) whether we need the server to set up the new 1.4.1 revision. But hopefully we'll be able to keep them going for a while, and minimize downtime.
* Shortly after 1.4.1 comes out, we will be setting up a **temporary 1.4.1 chaos server** on **event.nerd.nu**. Note that this temp server is volatile, and may be occasionally reset, though stability should improve over time. We'll also be using temp chaos to test our other server plugins, so don't expect a full chaos experience all the time - we may be testing things like LWC, protections, and non-flowing water/lava over the life of the map(s). But this should still be a fun way to explore 1.4.1 with your friends :D
* [As noted before](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/11vuuz/announcement_all_servers_will_be_resetting_for_14/), we'll launch new revisions on each of our main servers once they're fully updated for 1.4.1.

----

**TL;DR:** New Minecraft patch (1.4.1) on Thursday; temp 1.4.1 chaos on event.nerd.nu; current revisions stay up on 1.3 for a while, so hang on to your 1.3 .jar

For those of you who are active on PvE, or have been keeping an eye on the subreddit, you are probably aware of the recent decision to try to enforce a “reasonable mob farm size” standard for mob farms on PVE, in an effort to reduce the total number of mobs across the server and improve server performance.  We know that many of you are unhappy with the way we handled this decision, including how the decision was reached, communicated, and implemented.  We have been collecting a lot of feedback and discussion over the past few weeks.  With this in mind, the objective of this post is threefold:

1. To apologize for the execution of the mob culling policy;
2. To provide some context on how we arrived where we did, and how we’ve been enforcing it;
3. To present a set of alternatives for handling mobs on P, and to **collect your input on how best to proceed.**  While I hope you read the rest of this post, feel free to skip to the end if you want to see the alternatives and how we’re collecting feedback.

----

**First off, an apology...**

On behalf of all the admins, we want to apologize for our handling of the mob culling approach.  The decision to do so was well-intentioned - to be able to reduce the number of mobs on the server, necessary for strong server performance, without having to to subject you guys to another mob cap, which I don’t think anyone enjoyed.  We’ve known from the moment we set this up that aspects of this approach would be inherently subjective - there’s no way to establish a farm size that makes sense for every single farm on the server - so we have tried to be as fair as possible in enforcing this.

That said, we should have sought more feedback from the community before making such a major and invasive change; we should have done a much better job of communicating the change, not just on the subreddit; and we should have done a better job not only explaining our enforcement, but letting you guys know to come talk to us if you felt it was being enforced unfairly.  We have tried to act in the best interests of a happy, stable server - but if the players don’t trust the approach and its implementation, then we have failed in our objectives.  Regardless of how we proceed, we want to do a better job of communicating.

Thus, we want to take steps to address the concerns raised, some of which will be discussed at the staff meeting.  **As of now, while we discuss alternative approaches, the mob culling policy is not in effect.** This does not mean go absolutely nuts with mobs.  Remember, mob drops are still plumped. But while we figure out a fair way to proceed, we’re not going to be enforcing strict limits.

----

**Second, the context...**

As you know, P has always struggled to maintain comparable performance to the other two servers for a given number of players.  For people who were around this summer, you are probably aware of the decision to combat the unbearably low server TPS* by reducing the number of mobs on PvE. Before any cullings, PvE had nearly 11,000 mobs in loaded chunks at any one time, and we were running at roughly 2 TPS, or 10% speed.  By comparison, Survival had 3000 mobs and was running at 20 TPS, or 100% speed. After testing and searching out all possible sources of memory usage and lag, the techs and admins came to the conclusion that one of major culprits was the sheer number of animals on P.

*Ticks per second (TPS) is a measure of how fast the server is running.  TPS is exceptionally important, for it determines how fast your farms grow, your mobs age and regrow wool, redstone accuracy, boat/cart lag, and many other things.  Having low TPS and high memory use not only lags the game, but puts the server at risk of crashes, like the rollbacks and map corruption we’ve seen in previous revisions.

We knew that past implementations of mob caps were met unfavorably, and we didn’t have a good technical alternative, we looked for an alternative method and decided to try having the P admins monitor individual farms.  Though this policy has been very successful in increasing server stability, (as we're now running at a constant 20 tps with roughly 4.5k mobs on average) there have been both positive and negative comments regarding it. We're sorry if any of you felt that your concerns were not heard, but trust me, we pay attention to everything said on the forum and subreddit, and do our best to be active in-game to get a feel for all of the various opinions  brought up in chat. If you ever have any questions or concerns, all of the  server and head admins are approachable, through PM’s in-game, on reddit, on IRC or in mumble.

There is a great deal of discussion that goes on between the mods and admins, everything from individual modreqs and ban appeals to policy decisions, and the mob culling was no exception. We have moved [these](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/16845/formerly-admin-chat-feedback-on-the-new-mobfarm-culling-policy-on-p#Item_13) [two](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/16843/ac-trade-signs-spawn-portals-and-the-p-philosophy) admin chat forum threads to the public sections, and in them you'll find a good deal of discussion regarding mobs and the PvE philosophy in general. We have tried to leave this threads as unedited as possible, only removing reference to a few specific incidents (in an effort to avoid stirring up further drama) and sensitive information from logs. The gaps in the dates between posts are when enough admins were together in IRC that we could talk there, rather than through forum posts, but these issues have been under constant discussion for over three weeks.

----

**Finally, the path forward...** 

All of us want what's best for the community, and have tried our hardest to be fair while addressing the technical limitations of the server. We feel we've managed to come up with four possible, very different solutions regarding mobs that we want to try.  These suggestions are listed below.  Remember, mob drop plumping is still in effect.

Under these extraordinary circumstances, given the background with this issue, and the fact that it's a policy that affects the server and gameplay in a fundamental way, **we've decided to put these various options to a vote.** Voting will be open **after the conclusion of tonight’s creative event**, and we will be using the results to help us make our final decision. In an attempt to reach all of our players and not just the ones active on the subreddit, **this voting will occur in-game, with a /vote command and a broadcasted link to this thread.** Voting will be open for a week, with only one vote per player.   Of course, you’re also welcome to leave feedback below.

----

**Option 1:** Have no practical restrictions on mobs.  Only extreme cases directly affecting server/client performance in the area (e.g. out-of-control villager breeding) would be looked at.

* **Pros:** This allows every player to have as many mobs as they wish.  No subjective enforcement needed.
* **Cons:** Historical data strongly implies that this will significantly affect server performance.  Reduction to 2-4 TPS is likely.  The risk of crashes, rollback, and map corruption will increase.

----

**Option 2:** Continue with a refined version of the current approach, admin monitoring of farms, with no technical limitations.  We will make a concerted effort to explain our approach and specify appropriate farm sizes on a case-by-case basis, whenever possible.

* **Pros:** No technical limitations on the existence or breeding of mobs, both hostile and passive.  Allows players to exceed mob limits temporarily, particularly if discussed with an admin, or the farm is actively being tended to.
* **Cons:** Impossible to develop universal standards that are appropriate for every farm on the server.  Inherently subjective; requires judgment calls from the admins, and trust from the playerbase in that judgment.  Requires a lot of work from admins to enforce; excessively large farms may not be noticed immediately.
	
----

**Option 3:** Use an experimental mob cap plugin, developed by c45y.  This enforces a per-chunk mob cap, and only culls mobs when a chunk is unloaded.  (This does **not** include chunks unloaded during restarts.)  The exact size of this cap is not yet determined, but will be public knowledge.  Any reductions in the cap will be announced ahead of time.

* **Pros:** Allows unlimited mob breeding as long as a chunk is active.  Enforcement is objective.  Because enforcement is on a per-chunk basis, mob distribution should be better than a traditional cap.
* **Cons:** Experimental plugin, may have unintended consequences. May result in lag spikes if players breed heavily. Per-chunk mob limits will almost certainly be very low, to maintain a reasonable of total mobs across the server, especially if the per-chunk limits are gamed by players.

----

**Option 4:** Use a hard mob cap, like those used in the past.  The exact size of this cap is not yet determined, but will be public knowledge.  Any reductions in the cap will be announced ahead of time.

* **Pros:** No mob breeding lag spikes. Guaranteed target mob numbers and server stability.  Enforcement is objective.
* **Cons:** Kills mobs based on which chunks were loaded first/last, which can be unfair and arbitrary.  Easily possible for certain regions/towns to end up with much larger farms, depending on the evolution of the mob count and who breeds what and where.  Severely limits the existence of roaming mobs (including hostile), as well as the ability to breed new mobs.
 
----

Other suggestions are welcome, either through a comment here or contacting an admin directly.  One suggestion is to augment any option with some kind of trade signs, but we are extremely weary of moving so far away from survival mode gameplay. Another is to try to set up farms at spawn, as Appleanche suggested in a thread earlier today.  Another is to mess with the extent of mob drop plumping.  And while all of this is happening, we’ll be looking for other ways to improve performance, which may allow us to revisit this later.
 
We would also like to reiterate that if under any circumstances you ever have any concerns, PLEASE talk to us, we are here to help. :)

I had an interesting idea for a charity event/end of the revision party. This could only happen if PVE and S were reset around the same time. The basic idea is that S would invade PVE The plan goes as follows:

1. Both maps are saved before it is announced downloading later
2. It is announced a few days before the event that S will be **invading** PVE
3. The PVE'ers are given time to construct bunkers, build traps, defenses, and get ready to battle, S players ready potions and weapons
4. A fancy plugin(multiworld?) or other tech-admin wizardry connects the two maps/servers via a plugin
5. The S people invade the PVE server, going up against the traps, defenses, and superior number of carebears
6. The chaos begins!

Just an idea,
Let me know what you think :)

I mean, without WorldEdit, changing my still water to flowing water must have taken a lot of effort. Also, a big thank you to the tech admins responsible for the plugin, because I have noticed no additional lag at all. None.

1322673281.0,25,self.mcpublic,muwl1,[PVE] Regarding Glowstone &amp; The Nether,26,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/muwl1/pve_regarding_glowstone_the_nether/,"So I'd say less than 5 days in the large majority of glowstone was gone, and now it seems just about all gone.

Glowstone in most small to mid sized servers as well as SSP is a (very) common resource. It's also a very useful and unique one that no other block can duplicate.   Like most players who missed out on the gold rush it's sort of frustrating not to have such a (imo) critical block unavailable.

Now the mods have come up with the idea of swapping Lapis for Glowstone at a 16:1 ratio [here](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/8642/pve-nether-the-end#Item_5).

To me 16:1 is really high.  Lapis in itself is uncommon and you'll get about 4-8 per block.  Veins at least in my playing time are typically fairly small too.  I branch mined at level 13 for about 2 hours last night and explored some caves around level and managed to find just a stack of lapis.  That would only amount to 4 glowstone blocks for 2 hours of searching.  

Compare that to other servers where 2 hours in the nether would probably get me at least a dozen stacks of glowstone dust equaling around 200 blocks of glowstone.

So I guess my first idea would be to cut the ratio in half to 8:1 to reflect this.   Or possibly substitute something that is easier to find but up the ratio.  Redstone might be a good one to do at high ratio, since it's fairly common you won't have to go on wild goose chases like Lapis but you'll have to get a lot of it (48:1 or 64:1?).

Another question I have is if it's possible to regenerate the Glowstone in the Nether without resetting anything else? That way it's still natural and sort of a challenge to get, but it retains it's common status if it's regenerated weekly.

1370842356.0,24,self.mcpublic,1g11v4,Announcing the implementation of two new plugin changes (and a minor fix)!,29,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1g11v4/announcing_the_implementation_of_two_new_plugin/,"I'll start off with the minor fix! As many people will know, some time last week the script that we have set up that handles the armoured head drops stopped working. Turns out this was an issue within the CommandHelper plugin itself, and the effect trickled down to the script we were using. This has since been fixed within CommandHelper itself, and armoured head drops now work again! Additionally, you no longer need to worry about named swords or the fire aspect on your weapon stealing your precious loot - these will no longer play a deciding factor in whether or not a head drops!

**Now, onto the new stuff!**

Probably the most anticipated command of the revision, yes, you can *finally* **ignore** people (goodness, that sounds so bad to be glad for). The only issue with our current setup is that this will only work for public chat, and not /me or personal messages. However, if someone persists in messaging you privately after you have requested them to stop, then it's toeing the line of harassment and we can look into moderating such an issue.

The commands for this are straightforward and are case-insensitive, so you don't have to worry about correctly capitalising someone's name to ignore them. The commands work like so:

/ignore playername - Will ignore the player with the specified name

/ignorelist - Will list the people you currently have ignored

/unignore playername - Will allow you to return to seeing the player's contributions to chat

And it views like this in-game: http://i.imgur.com/JRG8lGt.png when you type each of these commands.

We will be looking into the potential of getting something set up so that private messages (and /me) are possible to ignore as well, but hopefully this works well in the meantime :)

The second big change we're bringing in - **invisibility potions** (as well as **night vision potions**) are once again brewable! The potions were blocked previously over concerns about players abusing the ability of being invisible, however these concerns have been remedied somewhat by introducing two features:

&gt;**Edit**: Looks like something's unintentionally blocking the fermented spider eyes from completing its brewing cycle and it won't create invisibility potions from the night vision ones. Apologies for this, but it looks like we won't have an available tech admin to take a look at this for a little bit :( I'll update this post when this bug has been fixed!

* Invisibility potions will wear off upon striking another player
* Invisibility potions will wear off upon being struck *by* another player

So plan your potting wisely, and don't strike until you're sure you're ready. 

I would like to emphasise great thanks towards **smiler100** for putting together these features that made bringing back invisibility potions possible, as well as **LadyCailin** for making the fix to the CommandHelper issue and working with us to get these changes implemented on the actual server.

To keep some general anticipation going (and to prod myself to hurry up putting it together), we'll be setting up a formal discussion thread on the forums some time within the next week on the topic of where we stand in terms of the next Survival revision, when would be the most appropriate time to move over to a new revision, and what we would like to carry over, newly implement, or remove as part of Revision 22. 

To declare now, there are **no set plans** for the reset date for Survival, and we will not be announcing this in the forum thread, we will simply be opening up discussions about it. I look forward to hearing everyone's input on this topic when we get the post set up, so please stand by and note down any ideas you might like to bring up in discussing the new revision. We'll make sure to put an announcement post up here on the subreddit as well as put out a rotating [Server] message in-game when the forum post goes up, to ensure maximum visbility.",Survival,False,,t5_2s52h,1370843724.0,survival,,True,t3_1g11v4,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1g11v4/announcing_the_implementation_of_two_new_plugin/,moderator

We’ve gotten a lot of feedback from you about how to make S a more fun place to play, and we’re using this revision to try out many of those ideas.  It will be exciting, and a good chance to see where we want to take S from here. First, about the new map:

* **4000x4000**, same as usual, we’re gonna jump back to vanilla terrain this map.

* Based on your feedback (which was mixed but seemed to lean towards not doing warps), we won’t be doing spawn warps this map.  But...

* We’ve set up the roads and portals to make travel all over the map quick and painless.  Grid-like system for the roads (similar to revs 15 and 17), with four cardinal roads connected via two “ring roads,” kind of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QSWSjNn.png).  And lots of road portals. Seriously, like, 24 of them, all connected with Nether roads, too.  Plus the four hidden portals.

* Roads will generally be protected up to 25 blocks above and 5 blocks below. Please don’t try to cover entire sections of road, or build drops into other people’s bases; we’ll ask you to remove such things.

* [Spawn](http://i.imgur.com/j2wXNA5.jpg)! [Main arena](http://i.imgur.com/Cx9evUoh.jpg) (winning design by Bestor)! [Public arena](http://i.imgur.com/fOWbMec.png) (winning design by mrloud15)!

----

New/returning features that will be available **at launch**:

* **Clan chat** will be available for all players - details [here](http://redd.it/1ba4v1) (format will be the same as on C). Remember - *this is a group /msg system, it is not intended to be used as a global chat replacement.* Players should still feel comfortable using global chat in all the ways they would have before.

* I’ll be running a **weekly arena league** this revision, to encourage lots of top-tier fighting.  Basic premise is that you’ll earn points from fights at special arena nights toward revision-long standings.  Winner gets awesome bragging rights - more info next week!

* The **survival leaderboard** at http://nerd.nu/survival should be back up and running again (with a clean slate) at the start of the rev!

----

Gameplay that hasn’t changed from last revision:

* The book recipe still doesn’t require leather.

* All enchantments are enabled.  All potions are enabled except invisibility (for now, anyway).

* Use /unenchant to remove enchantments from items (including books).

* No villagers.

* Experience will be plumped (more on this in the comments).

* Please get a mod to protect your beacon pyramid so people don’t steal the valuable blocks all the time.

* Earn the skulls of the vanquished!  If both you and your opponent are wearing all iron/diamond armor (with Protection 3 or 4 on the chestplate and legs), you’ll drop your head upon death.  More info [here](http://redd.it/19tgy1)!

We’ll also be adding a bunch of features during the rev, most of which came directly from your feedback [here](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/18388/s-improving-the-s.nerd.nu-experience/p1). More on that in part 2!

----

Finally, a bit of commentary about S policy. Thanks for your recent [feedback](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/18441/lets-discuss-base-camping) on base camping.  There was certainly no consensus, but the general vibe seemed to be that there are many instances of base camping that make sense from a gameplay perspective, but there are also some where the intention is clearly to prevent other players from playing the game.   And it’s ultimately this latter behavior that we’re not comfortable having on the server.  Yes, it’s a competitive server, but it’s also a server for people to have fun playing Minecraft with PVP.  The line should be drawn where your actions become solely about denying other players that opportunity.

Here’s the general idea of the policy we have in mind, written to hit on as many of the points from your feedback as is reasonable:

&gt; *Do not repeatedly attack and kill ungeared players, to prevent them from leaving or entering parts of the map.  Players found doing so will be asked to move on, and may face consequences if persisting.*

&gt; * *Ungeared means PVP equipment, building materials, and/or any other inventory items.*

&gt; * *A good rule of thumb is that if your group has killed a player twice in the last half hour and has no items to show for it, it’s time to move on.*

But we’re gonna try not adding this to the rules, and hope that a rule like this can go without saying - that we can all have the attitude where actively preventing other people from playing the game is not okay.  I really don’t want us to have to add such nitpicky rules for cases like this.  We’ll file this under the broad category of “respect other players and their time”, which hopefully is common sense and a default behavior for everyone, no matter how worked up you get over the game.

Ello PvEr's! Some of you may remember a [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1950l6/jeb_says_15_in_around_2_weeks_what_does_this_mean/c8kv10n?context=3) a little while back about the plan for the upcoming 1.5 update and new rev. I'd introduced the idea of ""Passive-Aggressive vs Environment"" or PAvE, and it seemed like people were interesting in trying it. The 1.5 update is expected to drop this coming Wednesday, at which point Rev 10 will be going down so that we can host a fun chaos map with the new items. But 24 hours before that, we will be trying out PAvE on the **current** map. The final save for the archives will happen Monday evening, and then it will be a full Tuesday of blowing everything to radioactive smithereens! 

What is PAvE?

PAvE is essentially vanilla pve.
 
* Swords and bows will still not deal damage to players. 
* Safe buckets will be turned off, so all water and lava will flow.
* Fire spread will be turned on - wood buildings beware!
* TnT and creeper damage will be turned on.

All protections (save for spawn) will be turned off, and **chaos rules will be in effect.** 

This will be a temporary end-of-the-rev party and **all normal rules of PvE will return with the new rev.** This includes banning work-arounds used to indirectly pvp.

I'm starting to think the level of trolling, mean spirited, and drama filled stuff happening on S needs to stop.  This is a game... can't we all just have some fun and try to figure some of this stuff out on our own?  I understand it's competitive, but above all we should be cordial with each other and not taking advantage of blatant limitations or mistakes.  

As far as the grinders are concerned... here's what's going to happen.

* Tonight I will be removing the offending platforms from around the grinders.  (by platforms I, of course, mean all builds intended to disrupt the existing enderman grinders). 
* You will have ~three days (until midnight GMT on the 14th) to claim the land you need around your grinder (normal rules apply to your claim, do not claim already claimed land if not part of this drama). 
* After that point normal rules apply.  This means the same thing can happen in the future if you don't plan ahead.  

As far as the chests/builds above the warp points.  Apparently we made the protections too small and allowed player placed chests to have access from the ground, that was an oversight and I seriously wish more players would simply inform us of this obvious mistake before taking advantage of them.  

* I will be removing all of the chests and builds from immediately above the warp platforms tonight.  (If I find anything of value, iron or higher, I will mail you and reimburse). 
* The protections will be raised to disallow this abuse in the future.

**100% of all received donations will go directly to Child's Play.** Child's Play is a wonderful game industry charity which raises millions annually to improve the lives of children by providing toys and games to hospitals worldwide.

We'll provide more specific details the day of the event. For now, mark your calendars, invite your friends, and we hope to see you there!",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,t3_o35oa,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/o35oa/this_weekend_rmcpublic_2012_charity_marathon/,moderator

As of this week, I've been one of your head admins for a year. It's been a blast, but I'm at the point where there aren't many new ideas I can bring to the job. More importantly, I'm graduating! It's time for me to shuffle off into the real world, so I'm officially retiring.

That being said, you won't notice too much of a difference. I'll still be doing scads of modreqs and banning people left and right; I just won't be as active with the behind-the-scenes mischief.

""Players using modifications to change gameplay may be asked to stop, kicked, or banned with little or no warning depending on the severity of the situation. This includes, but is not limited to: flying, speed modifications, **xray/ore-detection**, player radars, and duping hacks.""

There is **no** gray area on this rule, people - you are willingly breaking the rules when you turn it on, and we have many tools at our disposal to detect it.

In the interest of protecting the competitive balance on the server - as x-raying is perhaps most damaging to that balance - we've asked moderators on S to significantly increase the penalties on users caught x-raying.  I will not tolerate players ruining the experience for everyone else.

### General Tips

* Don't grief.    
* Griefing: Deliberate destruction or obstruction of another's creation.    
* Griefer: One who griefs.    
* Play the single-player game before joining the server! There are a lot of nuances of the game you need to be     familiar with before you try to play multiplayer.    
* When you enter the server for the first time, take a moment to look around the spawn point.    
* To talk, press T.    
* All commands must be typed in chat, and be preceded by /(forward slash).    
* To get back to Spawn at any time, type ""/spawn"".    
* Need a quick refresher on available commands? Type ""/help 1"" and ""/help 2"".    
* Make an awesome structure, and want other people to see it? Ask a Mod to set a warp.
* Have a lot of items you need to get rid of? Don't just drop them. Go to Spawn, and toss them in the incinerator.    
* Lava, Water, Obsidian, Bedrock, TNT, Mob Spawners, Flint and Steel, Fire, Minecarts, Minecart Tracks, and     Switches are banned. These items are either not optimized for multiplayer and result in a crash, or can be easily exploited for destruction.    
* Be warned: The server restarts every hour automatically to clear lag and memory leaks.
* Have a complaint, or just want to hang out? Get on Mumble! Server: mumble.nerd.nu Port: 6162
* Want a reserve slot on the server? Donate to Kiva, and get a reserve slot for a month! Kiva is an international micro-loan agency, and you get your money back as the borrowers pay it off.

### Causes of Server Lag

The following are purely hypotheses.

* Large number of droped items on the ground.
* Large amounts of water/lava dynamic spreading.
* Many players online at once.
* Thousands of stored player files.
* Disk usage.


### Future of the Server

There are many things we plan to implement in the near future.

* Player stats
* Automatic cartograph generation and upload

For over four years now, we all have worked and played hard to make these servers awesome, but the fight is not over - we have yet again to play Minecraft until our hands feel as if they’re about to fall off, and this time for a good cause! Us!   

The event will be a fundraiser - the servers need your help to keep running for the next 12 months, and beyond. So, time to roll up your sleeves, laugh in the face of fatigue, and play Minecraft for all you’re worth! (And donate if you’d like.)

**Date/Time:** Saturday, June 22 @ 4:00pm EDT [Convert this to my time zone!](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CTF+Fundraiser&amp;iso=20130622T16&amp;p1=179)

**Details:** None! Just kidding - it’s CTF like the last two times, but we’ve prepared a few new twists to the “old” format ;) We have taken into account the ton of feedback we’ve gotten over the last six months from the last event and have incorporated what we could, coupled with several twists of our own! Keep your eyes to the subreddit for possible teasers over the coming week.

She's also put in an inhuman amount of effort to make PvE have highly unique spawns, the Rev. 8 forest/canyon being of particular note.

**The second announcement** is that sometime in the coming days our forums are getting a face-lift. The current forums software we use is old and bits of it are broken, so we are moving to new, more up-to-date and dynamic software.

*What does that mean for you?* The forums will still be accessible at nerd.nu/forum, but you **will** have to make a new account. The old forums will also still be accessible (but not editable) at nerd.nu/oldforum (probably). We'll let you know if that changes!

The new forums will function much like the old ones, but expect some changes and improvements. If you have questions/comments/concerns, you are welcome to post here, in the new forums (when they go live) or contact staff via the various ways we have available (in-game, ).

 *  The holes ALL OVER the map. There is absolutely no reason for those, they were just rage inducing. They did nothing but made it to difficult to run while being pursued. I would use a vanilla map in the future.

 *  The mountains were ridiculous. Just as the holes they made it to difficult to raid another base. And if someone does raid a base it is almost impossible to push them back. Again I would use a vanilla map.

 *  The map was to huge. Takes 10 minutes by a straight tunnel to get to a base (if you don't fall in a hole) 

 *  Moderating. I found several instances at a certain base where in a protected door, fences were placed making it impossible to proceed into the fort. Also, during the snafu of all green team being kicked, no mods were present. While I know you all have lives and worked for hours to set this up with little sleep. It could have been moderated better.

With my bitching over, i will however say that I think this event has brought some closer together, yet, drove more people apart. This event has shown many people how to work together and co-operate to 
accomplis a common goal. While it had it's ups and downs, it was very fun and I thank all the moderators, admins and tech-admins for all the amazing work you guys did with very little sleep. I thank you.

---------------------------------
Alright, so I have been working on ideas for how to make the mob cap system work in such a way that makes the loss be equal and people not lose everything.  This is the idea that I have come up with that should have a balance between satisfying the users while keeping the server stable.

So the basic idea is to split the map into sectors and limit mobs in quadrants as well as globally.  The current PvE map is 6000x6000, each chunk is 16x16, the map would be divided into 15x15 quadrants.  What this would mean is that there are 225 quadrants on the map.   Each quadrant would be 25x25 chunks.  So the map would be broken up like so

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

So what we would do is have a mob cap across the whole map for mobs, if we focus just on sheep for now, say we allow 1500, that would allow 6.6667 (so we will round that to 7) per sector.  Now, this does not mean you can only have 7 sheep.  What this means is that you will never go below that seven.  If there are sectors (which there will be) that do not have their max count, you will be able to have more in your sector to a maximum (tbd).  This will ensure that you wont lose all of sheep (you will have at least 7).

I know that while this might not be the best solution, but it is the solution that I think works best for this situation, and _hopefully_ we will be able to remove this eventually when 1.3 comes out.  But for now, this is kind of what we are left with.

#### If you have ANY valid input towards this, please voice it, if you have nothing constructive to say, then don't bother. ####

#### On another side note, I would like that say that I am very disappointed in the way that this community has reacted in this situation.  I understand that things kinda got screwed up with last solution, but when this server is being run by volunteers in their free time, you harassing admins in mumble, etc when it has already been said that a solution would be worked on when I was not at work.

So, I present the results: an overhead map of the pve server. Hopefully some of you find it interesting, maybe even a little bit useful. :)

http://www.mediafire.com/imageview.php?quickkey=qophdblysretqfy&amp;thumb=6 MediaFire due to size; there's a link to download the original file below the image (6000,6000; 11.3MB).

How to read: Biome colors are displayed correctly for grass, though not in swamps. However you can still tell where a swamp is by all the green specks in the water. Additionally blocks at higher elevations are lighter, so for instance the really pale patches of grass should be plateaus or mountain tops.

Water isn't transparent because I couldn't get it to not look terrible. For similar reasons glass isn't displayed at all. Or netherbrick fences, though that one I have no idea why.

More info: I started this when the most recent maps where a few weeks old. Some people were using Rei's minimap and patching together screenshots. Since that's allowed due to adding no additional server load, and only displaying a surface map, I decided to try to write my own mod that instead saves the map to an image on my hard drive.

Once I had that working I then got to running concentric laps around the server to fill it in. Due to the sheer amount of time involved in that, I decided to finish even though the live map is now working. It's not exactly a user-friendly finished mod, more of one big hack that worked just well enough to get the job done. But here's the source, in case anyone is curious: EDIT: updated source: http://pastebin.com/YktuK0WM

So, thanks for looking. Hopefully it's a little bit useful. Oh, and if anyone was interested there's two small mushroom islands near x = -2000, z = +400.",,False,,t5_2s52h,True,,,True,t3_nrp8v,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/nrp8v/pve_overhead_static_map/,

1302772219.0,24,self.mcpublic,gps5p,[PvE] A proposal to enhance cooperation trade and exploration by making travel better balanced,24,0,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/gps5p/pve_a_proposal_to_enhance_cooperation_trade_and/,"**Currently in PvE we have a few non-standard but very useful ways to travel, which open up the map to some degree. Pre-defined roads and gates allow travel to one of 6 different nodes. /sethome allows travel to one more user-defined location. I propose adding /spawn (or enabling it - I believe it's already in the mod)**

What we currently makes sense, especially on PvE: it allows better cooperation and exploration along the two major axes and some way to get back to your site quickly. However, getting back to spawn is another matter (effectively a central marketplace as well). Right now, if I am not on a major road or near a gate site travel is prohibitive: it's a very long slog. If I want to trade with others from a distant home not on the beaten path I can walk all the way, but to paraphrase someone else, it's Minecraft, not Walkcraft.

Right now there's only one easy way to get to spawn (if you are /sethome far away): stash everything and die. There! You're at spawn, but with nothing to trade. You can load up on a few things like wheat or such and /home back to your base via /sethome.

Adding (enabling) the /spawn command would remove this asymmetry, allowing people to go to the spawn area as quickly as they can leave it, from one particular point (presumably their base). It would greatly encourage trade as well as donations: notice how empty the public donation bins at spawn always are? Other than a few found objects like feathers (mainly feathers!) I've seen little else for the new player to start with short of random kindness by people nearly the spawn area. I'm sure people put things there (I was grateful so I ""passed it on"" early on), but it's prohibitive once you are settled far afield.

There's an argument that this might lead to more space usage. However, maps here really don't have a long shelf life... it's always a few months at most before they are reset. That leaves a lot of unexplored territory no matter what.

And this isn't PvP, where such commands are ripe for abuse. Here, we're cooperating if we interact at all.

**Adding /spawn would allow people to cooperate and trade while exploring far-flung places (if they wish). And as always, you still have to hike to that remote place to begin with.**
