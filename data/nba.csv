1362439156.0,2866,self.nba,19o38z,"Hi r/NBA, my name is Robert and I'm an athletic trainer. This is my Kobe Bryant work ethic story.",5097,2231,725,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/19o38z/hi_rnba_my_name_is_robert_and_im_an_athletic/,"I've been a professional athletic trainer for about 16 years and have been able to work with a range of athletes from the high school to professional level. Right now I run in a clinic in Cincinnati and have most recently been training with some players on the Bengals. 

I activated my reddit account just a moment ago and because I've been seeing the videos of Kobe's most recent dunks and the comments you guys have had to share I decided I might as well chime in what I know about the man. And let me just state by saying that this story doesn't touch on anything we don't know about Kobe but rather that he simply is not human when he is working on his craft.

I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, and as we know they would eventually bring home the Gold (USA). I've had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. We first met three days before the first scrimmage, on the day of the first practice, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time. 

The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up. 

""Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I'm not disturbing anything right?""

""Uhh no, what's up Kob?""

""Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that's all.""

I checked my clock. 4:15 AM. 

""Yeah sure, I'll see you in the facility in a bit.""

It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn't even 5AM. 

We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow. 

I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility. 

This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went -- I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, ""Good work this morning.""

""Huh?""

""Like, the conditioning. Good work.""

""Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.""

""So when did you finish?""

""Finish what?""

""Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?""

""Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.""

My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there's no surprise to why he's been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication, every quote that he's said about hard work all came together and hit me like a train. It's no surprise to me now that he's dunking on players ten years younger than him and it wasn't a surprise to me earlier this year when he led the league in scoring. 

Thanks for reading and allowing me to share you my Kobe Bryant story. If anyone has any questions I can clarify. Sorry if the story was at all hard to follow as this is my first time on reddit.

Rob.

You got Harden's beard distracting everyone from your average post game, and Lin and Parsons can't trash talk about your toughness because they are in a full on bromance. No state income taxes. I get it. Slim Thug fixin' you with bad bitches. I get it. Baby Mamas only getting 20%. I get it.

But if you though Kobe was riding your ass, wait until you have a pair of post legends trying to make you a competent post scorer after your neglect of the art for nearly the past decade.

Dwight, you can still change your mind. Come to Milwaukee. We almost literally don't have a roster. We almost literally don't have a general manager capable of making intelligent decisions. We almost literally will have probably watched all the teams in our division get better than us, worse than us, and then better than us again over the last decade. You can literally be the GM and build-a-team like some 2k shit.

No one will talk shit about you. There is literally no pressure. People are too burnt out after Packer season to give a shit about this franchise. Aaron Rodgers and Ryan Braun will be recognized on the street more than you will. People will ask you if you are a new linebacker for the Packers and you'll respond ""No, I'm the center for the Bucks"" and they will ask you why you are here instead of in Tampa Bay practicing your long snaps.

How the fuck could you not want to play inside of [this fucking thing?] (http://media.jrn.com/images/mjs-bradley_-nws_-lynn_-1\(2\).jpg). It looks like the fucking architect realized last minute there were no fucking windows in his original design, so he decided to compensate by fucking *gluing* a smaller building to it that is *only* windows. WE COULD LITERALLY PAINT A MURAL TO YOU ON 90% OF THE BUILDING. LITERALLY. LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I PROMISE YOU THE OTHER SIDE LOOKS EVEN WORSE.

This is exactly what you want. Build your own team, no pressure, have fun, max deals until you die, no trade clauses, player options. Amnesty yourself if you get bored, no one will even know you were here.

1366638288.0,2075,self.nba,1cv1yk,IAmA Request: Kobe Bryant,4453,2378,352,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1cv1yk/iama_request_kobe_bryant/,"This request has been posted before: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/117rbr/ama_request_kobe_i_have_no_means_of_doing_this/

Didn't receive much attention and everyone was making fun of the OP.

However, I believe the moment is now, as Kobe has picked up a strong social media momentum, and, to be honest, he seems bored and has too much free time not being able to travel with the team so why the hell not to try to get him to do an AMA?

As the first request said it - he seems pretty comfortable writing and interacting with fans; in the meantime, he has confirmed this assumption by dominating twitter (seriously, the #dominate tweet was better than most of us could imagine). He has never seemed more human and humble and reachable.

I believe he is one of the most intriguing people in the NBA, not just because of his achievements, but simply because of his life path. I mean no need to explain, he's Kobe.

If he does agree to do the AMA, this is what I would ask the following:

* How has your partially European upbringing contributed to your development, both as a player and a person? How ""foreign"" did you feel upon your return to the US?

* What's your take on the Grantland article on your hip hop career? Could you answer this in rhymes?

* Are you aware of all the .gif-s of you on the interwebs? If so, which one is your favorite?

* Eddie Jones, Isiah Rider, Glen Rice, Mitch Richmond. What was your relationship with them? Did you learn anything from them?

* Did the facelift of the Lakers uniforms in 1999 have an additional psychological effect on you guys?

So yea. Hope this works well.

**EDIT ON FURTHER STEPS**: Judging by the support, this time the idea seems more plausible. So I guess the thing is now to proceed on to letting Kobe know about the initiative and actually getting him to do the AMA. I had already tweeted earlier, even before coming up with this post, and I guess mass tweeting to him might get him to pay attention. Any other ideas are welcome. Also, not sure if x-posting to r/lakers or r/IamA is a good idea? Hope to get valuable feedback in the comments.

**A BRILLIANT [IDEA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1cv1yk/iama_request_kobe_bryant/c9kfm9x)** by /u/omar12:

&gt;How hard would it be to send a ""get better soon"" basket to him on behalf of the reddit community? If this is possible, this can be a good push along with tweeting, to convince him to do an AMA or Game thread.

I told them about the accident, and that we'd be sore for a month or two, but everything was good.  They said ""Look, whenever you guys get healed up, give us a call, pick out a game and we'll comp you 5 tickets.""  And they did.  Last night we took the family down and caught the Cats play the Nuggets.  Had a great time and the boys had a fabulous belated Christmas gift.  Thanks a million to Charlotte.

* It is well-documented that Tim Duncan is one of the bigger nerds in the NBA.

&gt;Tim Duncan is the NBA's first superstar nerd. I find it very interesting that Tim Duncan's off the court pursuits include sword and knife collecting, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, fantasy videogames &amp; paintball. Add to that, dude's got a freakin' tattoo of Merlin from Arthurian lore! His other tat is of a Skeleton Jester. No barbed wire or homages to dead relatives here. Just pure (and endearing) D&amp;D nerdcore.

* He also wears a [Punisher Knee Brace](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/928712/Tim-Duncan-Punisher_medium.jpg)

* There has been a recent influx of funny Tim Duncan actions throughout the playoffs, which I am convinced is a result of him indirectly acquiring karma, knowing that /r/nba gets a kick out of every Tim Duncan moment caught on TV.

* If Manu did an AMA, there is no way that there aren't other people on the Spurs team that know about reddit, and naturally r/nba. In fact Tim Duncan might have been the person that convinced Manu to do it.

* If I can spend around 10-15 minutes a day on /r/nba it's really not that farfetched for NBA players to be browsing a little reddit in their free time. A bunch of them are on Twitter and Instagram.

and my last point...

* It just seems like a Tim Duncan thing to do, hiding around on /r/nba, blending in and posting with the rest of the posters. I can totally see Tim Duncan posting 'Spurs in 6' in the Finals prediction thread, knowing that people have no idea who just commented.",,False,,t5_2qo4s,1371542501.0,,Warriors1,True,t3_1gkknj,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gkknj/tim_duncan_i_know_youre_here_reveal_yourself/,

1371659066.0,1559,self.nba,1gnw0s,Some fun coincidences between this Heat team and the Kobe era Lakers,2127,568,420,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnw0s/some_fun_coincidences_between_this_heat_team_and/,"Last summer, just before the Finals, I started noticing coincidences between the Miami Heat team ('06 - present) and the post-Shaq Laker team. After Miami managed to equalise the series 3-3 last night, I was reminded of these events, and how they have perfectly carried on. There are differences between the teams, and I'm not saying that these mean anything, but they are quite interesting to see:

2002 - Los Angeles Lakers win title with Shaquille O'Neal

2006 - Miami Heat win title with Shaquille O'Neal

**2 Years Later**

2004 - Shaquille O'Neal leaves the Lakers, Lakers become lottery team

2008 - Shaquille O'Neal leaves the Heat, Miami become lottery team


**After that**

**2006, 2007** - After missing the playoffs, the Lakers have back to back 1st round exits. Their first playoff bout ends in 7, their second in 5. During this time, the team is essentially Kobe Bryant (A top-5 player) and garbage.

**2009, 2010** - After missing the playoffs, the Heat have back to back 1st round exits. Their first playoff bout ends in 7, their second in 5. During this time, the team is essentially Dwayne Wade (A top-5 player) and garbage.

--------------

**2008** - The Lakers' solid offseason/trade deadline allows them to become one of the best teams in the league.

**2011** - The Heat's solid offseason/trade deadline allows them to become one of the best teams in the league.

--------------

**2008** - The Lakers make it all the way to the Finals, without much competition, only to lose in 6 to a defensive minded team full of hungry veterans. Their star player recieves a ton of hate for his poor performance.

**2011** - The Heat make it all the way to the Finals, without much competition, only to lose in 6 to a defensive minded team full of hungry veterans. Their star player recieves a ton of hate for his poor performance.

--------------

**2009** - The Lakers make it back to the Finals, and get matched up against an unexperienced team featuring one of the brightest young stars in the NBA.

**2012** - The Heat make it back to the Finals, and get matched up against an unexperienced team featuring one of the brightest young stars in the NBA.

--------------

**2009** - The Lakers win in 5, proving all the doubters wrong

**2012** - The Heat win in 5, proving all the doubters wrong

--------------

**2010** - The Lakers make it back to the finals, matched up against a former title team with it's core still in tact.

**2013** - The Heat make it back to the finals, matched up against a former title team with it's core still in tact.

--------------

**2010** - The Lakers go down 3-2, but win Game 6 to force Game 7 at home.

**2013** - The Heat go down 3-2, but win Game 6 to force Game 7 at home.

--------------

**2010** - The Lakers manage to win game 7, claiming the NBA title and winning back-to-back.

I've been working on this on-and-off for years as a hobby. It's only recently gotten to the point where it's fairly complete. The general idea is that you act as the GM for a basketball team. You draft players, make trades, sign free agents, and adjust the roster to try to build a dynasty. But if you lose too many games or spend too much money, you might get fired.

If you're a programmer, [it's all open source](https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm). Hop in and start hacking. If you're not a programmer and you still want to help, then artwork, design (both UI and gameplay), testing, and feedback are all needed.

Last week I posted this thread giving details of my father that had been in a serious car accident: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1k3itw/my_father_was_paralyzed_on_monday_nighti_need/

I'm sad to say that today, at 6:42 pm eastern, he passed away due to multiple complications that popped up over the last 24 hours.

First of all, thank you for all of the support over the past few days.  I've had a number of conversations with you wonderful strangers and your kindness blows me away.  

Don't ask me why, but speaking about this whole thing publicly (to friends on Facebook, on the phone and here on Reddit) has been major part of the grieving and healing process.

Enough sadness!  Let's get to the happy stuff!

A number of you helped me get in touch with some NBA personalities and a few of them came through in a very short amount of time:

1.  Mark Cuban - u/rgluna gave me Mr. Cuban's personal email address and Mark sent me a direct email wishing my family the best.  A small gesture that shows what kind of character he has.

2.  Glenn Beck - u/eldertheelder put me in touch with a member of Mr. Beck's production team.  I've been told to expect a few signed items in the mail and we're excited to get them.

3.  The Lakers - u/horrificmedium came through huge and reached out to Linda Rambis (wife of former lakers player and current assistant coach Kurt Rambis).  Linda shipped out a whole box of Lakers gear to lift my dad's spirits.  This included: A regulation ball signed by the team, a smaller ball signed by Phil Jackson, a Lakers Hawaiian shirt (which is VERY much my dad's style), a Laker's blanket, Kareem and Chick Hearn bobbleheads (!), and a few other items.

Check the package out here: http://imgur.com/a/qWXLu#0

While my Dad wasn't able to enjoy the gear for long, my sister did have this to say: ""He was very agitated and moving a lot before and by the end was calm and still.""

Thank you to Reddit and to the Lakers for helping give my father a little bit of joy and peace during his final moments.  This helped put a smile on all 6 of his children's faces and my mother's face.

Since I have League Pass, I usually just replay the requested event from a game and post it here. However, every time someone requests a video they just say ""does anyone have a video for *this* or *that*"" without giving any sort of timestamp or frame. Exact time would be excellent but simply saying the quarter or even the half helps immensely. That way I can quickly find what you're looking for instead of going through the whole game.

Rant over.

Thank you.

Edit: (Thanks to /u/swollencornholio) A good way to figure out the time frame if you forgot when it was is ESPN's play-by-play. They give you down to the gametime second of shots, player substitutions, rebounds, steals, and assists.
The fastest way to get to the play by play that I found is google ""your team's name"" +""espn"" the first hit should bring you to your team page on espn.go.com , click schedule, then find said game. On the game page hit ""play by play.""

Edit2: (Thanks to /u/Mrjoehobo) There is also a play by play on nba.com game story/box score that is linked in the gamethread description.

Some real experts on this stuff have written for [HoopsWorld](http://www.hoopsworld.com/bogans-getting-paid-well-in-celtics-nets-deal) and [ShamSports](http://www.shamsports.com/2013/07/its-official-keith-bogans-will-earn.html) on this trade, too.

The Celtics/Nets trade may be one of the most complicated in NBA history but is also a really good study in how a smart front office can use the CBA to their advantage. Everyone focused on the draft picks in this trade but it turns out that the way the Celtics have positioned themselves for next year's free agent class might be just as important. Here's a break-down of what exactly happened in this trade. How did the Celtics end up with a big trade exception? Why did D.J. White appear in the trade at the last minute? Read on to find out...

**Important Concepts**

* The NBA doesn't always consider a trade to be a single transaction. Trades can be [simultaneous](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q82) or [non-simultaneous](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q83), and a single trade can be treated one way for one team and the other for the other team within a single trade.

* When a [team trades a minimum salary player](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q84), only the portion of the salary paid by the team is counted and that salary only counts for the ""outgoing"" team but not the ""incoming"" team. That means minimum contracts can be used to get to a ""salary match"" because they only count for one side of the trade equation.

* A free agent who made under $1.2M in the prior season that is included in a trade as a sign-and-trade player only counts half of their salary when trying to reach a salary match. This is known as a [base year compensation](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q87) player.

* [Trade kickers](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q97) have to be salary matched by teams accepting the player but the kicker does not count for the team trading the player away.

* Teams under the luxury tax have different trade rules than taxpaying teams and the rules are dependent on the size of the trade.

**What Went Down**

The Celtics and Nets decided they wanted to make a trade built around Pierce and KG. The Celtics made the Nets agree to take on Jason Terry's contract but the Nets really only had a few players they could include from their end. The problem was that the Nets are above the cap so they can only take in contracts equaling **125% + $100,000** of what they are planning on receiving. Also, Jason Terry had a trade kicker that made him more expensive for the Nets to receive by $400k/year.

Nets Get|Salary|
:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,333,334|
Kevin Garnett|$12,433,735|
Jason Terry (w/ trade kicker)|$5,625,313|
**Total**|**$33,392,382**|

To match this, the Nets would have to send out at least **$26,633,906** in salaries because the Nets are over ([way, way over](http://www.reddit.com/r/capology/comments/1i31e9/the_nets_roster_is_crazy_expensive/)) the luxury tax. However, all the Nets had that the C's were willing to take was:

Celtics Get|Salary
:--|--:|
Kris Humphries|$12,000,000
Gerald Wallace|$10,105,855
MarShon Brooks|$1,210,080
Kris Joseph|$788,872
**Total**|**$24,104,807**

The Nets were **$2,529,099** short. However, they had the rights to one Keith Bogans. Bogans only made the veteran's minimum last year which means if he were included in a sign-and-trade his contract would only count for half in the trade. This is to keep teams from gaming the system because it's expensive. The Celtics apparently didn't care because they just signed Bogans to twice the amount the Nets were short: **$5,058,198**. This made the trade valid from the Nets perspective, and that's all that really mattered.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,333,334|Keith Bogans|$2,529,099
Kevin Garnett|$12,433,735|Kris Humphries|$12,000,000
Jason Terry|$5,625,313|Gerald Wallace|$10,105,855
  |  |MarShon Brooks|$1,210,080
  |  |Kris Joseph|$788,872
**Total**|**$33,392,382**|**Total**|**$26,633,906**

-----------------------

Now that the trade was valid, the Celtics could break it up into multiple trades that give them the greatest benefit, even though it has to be viewed as a single trade by the Nets. Knowing that, the C's went to work.

First, minimum salary players never need a salary match so they traded nothing for Kris Joseph and then waived him. His salary only mattered to the Nets for contract matching purposes.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
  |  |Kris Joseph|$788,872
**TOTAL**|**$0**|**TOTAL**|**$788,872**

Next, the Celtics tried to put together the most beneficial multi-player trade possible. This is important because they could only get a trade exception from a trade where they only send one player so it was important that they preserve the largest contract possible for that purpose.

Originally, the plan was to trade Pierce and Terry for Humphries, Wallace and Brooks.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,333,334|Kris Humphries|$12,000,000
Jason Terry (w/o trade kicker)|$5,225,000|Gerald Wallace|$10,105,855
  |  |MarShon Brooks|$1,210,080
**TOTAL**|**$20,558,334**|**TOTAL**|**$23,315,935**

This would have worked fine, and left KG for creating a nice exception, but wasn't ideal. It would be better to include KG instead of Pierce but each trade has to be legal for the Celtics and that means they can only accept **$5,000,000** more what they're sending out and with KG's smaller salary they didn't quite make it because $12,433,735 + $5225000 +$5,000,000 = **$22,658,735** which is less than the salaries of Humphries, Wallace and Brooks.

Enter D.J. White. White has a league minimum, non-guaranteed contract. Minimum contracts only count for the outgoing team's salary so the Celtics could add him to any of their trades without the Nets having to add any more salary of their own. The Celtics were going to waive White, anyway, so instead they added him to Garnett and Terry to get over the salaries of Humphries, Wallace and Brooks. This only works because the Celtics are currently under the luxury tax. If they were over they could only accept 125% + $100,000 of outgoing salaries and they would have been **$37,100 short**. Instead, a trade of under $19.6M for a non-tax paying team is a match if the teams are within $5M, which they now just barely were.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Kevin Garnett|$12,433,735|Kris Humphries|$12,000,000
Jason Terry	|$5,225,000|Gerald Wallace|$10,105,855
DJ White|$884,293|MarShon Brooks|$1,210,080
**TOTAL**|**$18,543,028**|**TOTAL**|**$23,315,935**

The teams were then left with Pierce and Bogans. The Celtics can make the trade because, from their perspective, they're sending out more than they receive in contracts and that's always allowed. Because the Celtics are only including one player in this trade, they receive a trade exception for the difference.

Nets Get|Salary|Celtics Get|Salary|
:--|--:|:--|--:|
Paul Pierce|$15,333,334|Keith Bogans|$5,058,198
  |  |Trade Exception|**$10,275,136**
**TOTAL**|**$15,333,334**|**TOTAL**|**$15,333,334**

**So? What Does That Do?**

This trade exception expires on 7/12/14. The signing moratorium ends on 7/10/14. Keith Bogans' contract is completely non-guaranteed for 2014-15. This means that, during the moratorium at the beginning of next year's free agent period, **the Celtics could arrange a trade, or a sign-and-trade, for over $10M without sending any guaranteed contracts back plus they have Bogans' ""super expiring"" for over $5M more.** They could throw in some of their many draft picks to entice a team to agree to a sign-and-trade if they get a free agent to agree to sign in Boston. They could take someone else's expiring contract. They could help someone get below the luxury tax. They only have a few days to work with, but the Celtics not only picked up three draft picks (and the right to swap another) to build the future, they also made themselves real players in next year's free agent super class, if they want to be one.h",,False,,t5_2qo4s,1374063277.0,,Celtics1,True,t3_1igbmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1igbmp/explaining_the_celticsnets_trade_in_1000_easy/,

1362803058.0,1119,self.nba,19yf6h,My incredibly deranged prediction for this season,1570,451,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/19yf6h/my_incredibly_deranged_prediction_for_this_season/,"Here's my prediction for the remainder of the season:

The Lakers finally start playing inspired basketball with Dwight Howard becoming a fan favorite by playing “Shaq-like” basketball. In an unbelievable turn of events, the Lakers reel off twenty straight wins and advance all the way up to the fourth seed in the West. Redeeming himself even further, D12 makes game winning plays multiple times through the first three rounds of the playoffs.

Fast forward to the Finals, where the Lakers are playing Miami at home and leading Game 7 by one point with three seconds left. The Lakers hold home court after Miami finished the season on a terrible losing streak due to injuries to LBJ and D-Wade. After a time out, LeBron misses a fade away jumper that would’ve won the series for the Heat. Dwight Howard grabs the rebound, when we hear Jim Ross with this historic call: ""Howard with the rebound and this should lock up the champineship for the Lakers... GOOD GAWD ALMIGHTY! WITH GOD AS MA WITNESS, DWIGHT HOWARD JUST SLAM DUNKED THE BALL IN HIS OWN HOOP! WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON HERE? WAIT A MINUTE! LEBRON AND HOWARD ARE SHAKING HANDS!"" Jerry Lawler, who had previously despised Dwight Howard for being liked, suddenly turns into D12's biggest fan. 

Dwight removes his Lakers jersey to reveal a Heat jersey, stunning the Lakers and all their fans. It was all an elaborate hoax - the back injury, the desire to play in Los Angeles, the good guy act to win the fans back during the Lakers' playoff run. Dawning the black and red, Howard grabs the mic and cements himself as a heel when he says, ""All you stinking fans in this DUMP of a city can all KISS-MY-ASS!"" Expectedly, the crowd boos at the notion of their city being called a dump.

The Heat bench clears as they start decimating the Lakers with steel folding chairs. Immediately, the refs call for a disqualification, resulting in a no-decision for the NBA Finals. Metta World Peace, who has reverted to his Ron Artest persona, adds to the chaos by going into the stands and punching the first fan he comes across. Having seen enough, Shaquille O’Neal runs down to the court and starts fighting side by side with Kobe, as an emotionally charged arena cheers their every punch. Unfortunately, the Heat proves to be too much for the three-time championship duo. Kobe fights off a few Heat players, and tries to reason with Howard, who returns the Black Mamba's words with a choke slam through the scorer’s table. LeBron and D-Wade hold Kobe down as Howard rips off Kobe's jersey and spray paints, ""Queen Bryant"" on his chest.

When all hope seems lost, the crowd starts chanting, “MJ! MJ! MJ!” That's when Shaq gets up, breaks a basket with a dunk, causing glass to shatter and Steve Austin’s theme song to start playing. Michael Jordan appears, driving a Coors Light truck with Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, and Horace Grant standing on top. MJ gets out of the truck, drains a Mikeweiser, grabs the mic from a frightened Howard and screams, ""HOW 'BOUT WE MAKE THIS A THREE WAY DANCE?!"" in which the crowd responds: “OH HELL YEAH!”

The crowd erupts as the Bulls begin attacking the Heat players. Pippen starts punching LeBron and Wade, although he is stomping the court with his foot equally hard for some reason. Following one open-handed Pippen punch, LeBron James staggers and falls down exactly at center court. Dennis Rodman steps in, and delivers a People’s Elbow, running from one side of the court to the other, covering a distance of approximately 188 feet. 

On the sidelines, Magic Johnson renegotiates the Finals with the refs, and ultimately they decide a five minute overtime between the Heat, Lakers, and '93 Bulls is the only way to determine the true 2013 NBA champions.

During the overtime, Dwyane Wade chases after a loose ball and dives head first into the crowd, where is he is met by a deafening trash can shot by longtime Lakers fan and famous actor, Jack Nicholson. As Nicholson celebrates, Dwight Howard grabs him and readies him for a tombstone pile driver, but is met with a swift kick below the belt by Jeff Van Gundy. In a bizarre turn of events, every single player from each team is eliminated from the game through a series of foul-outs, low blows from Laker Girls, and being thrown over the newly installed top rope at courtside. Almost too surreal to believe, the final three players remaining are: Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan.

With one minute remaining, Kobe goes up for what looks to be a nail-in-the-coffin dunk, but is surprisingly met with a Singapore cane shot by Jordan, causing good ol’ J.R. to remark: “GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! MAMA BRYANT’S BABY BOY IS BROKEN IN HALF! HE MUSTA BEEN A GOOD TEN…. TWENTY FEET IN THE AIR!” Having witnessed the carnage, the Laker crowd – even the celebrities who are usually reserved but are now more animated than a junkie on Skid Row – start chanting “HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!” During a subsequent replay, Jim Ross claims, “And here’s another shot of that last series of events, folks. Kobe musta been a good… forty feet in the air when Jordan hit him with that foreign object.”

Exhausted from a combination of being fifty years old, playing a quarter of basketball, and knocking out Kobe with a thunderous Singapore cane shot, Jordan falls down at the three point line, perfectly perpendicular to the basket. Atop of the scoreboard is LeBron James, who launches a beautiful Five Star Frog Splash on Jordan. While he goes to cover Jordan, David Stern runs down to ringside. LBJ drapes an arm over Jordan and on the count of two, Stern orders the ref to “RING THE BELL GODDAMIT!” even though MJ kicked out. Ultimately, this gives LeBron James and the Miami Heat a very controversial NBA Championship, as Michael Jordan gets screwed over in his last match in Canada.

1349505053.0,1078,self.nba,1117b6,I can possibly get Ron Artest to do a AMA,1356,278,210,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1117b6/i_can_possibly_get_ron_artest_to_do_a_ama/,"Edit: I don't know if anyone reads this anymore, but I got some news........  mostly bad but some good. Ron never responded LOL my guess is he is too busy with preseason. However, his manager did respond to me. She actually said she and ron are aware of reddit AMA after Obama did his. It's just that they never decided to do it for one reason or another. She then told me, that Ron often does a live ustream and answers questions from twitter, so technically it should be like a video AMA, except on twitter instead of Reddit. I told her that Ron was very wanted on the reddit community, she would bring it up to him again. And that's all I have folks. Now, proceed to downvote me into oblivion! OP does not deliver!! 

3 years ago, he tweeted if there was anything to do in San Diego. I was attending UCSD at the time, and coincidentally UCSD was hosting an all campus dance at the time. I tweeted him to come to UCSD. I jokingly said ""your not down"" and gave him my number thinking he would never respond. Apparently he had direct messaged me ""what time should I come"" about three times on twitter, but I didnt check twitter. He then called me on the phone while I was eating at a cafeteria. Anyways, to save you guys from reading alot, he essentially came to my school and performed and let me go on stage with him. Needless to say, I became very popular. His manager thanked me through text for allowing Ron this opportunity. I kept in contact with him and his manager through text, and he has provided me with Laker tickets twice (btw I hate the Lakers, Rockets fan here). I sometimes text him and his manager and they have responded most of the time. He updates me with his new # each time (he goes through like several different numbers a year, because he is constantly doing giveaways). I just discovered reddit about 3 months ago, and barely realized this connection. I can possibly text him and his manager to do an AMA, if interest is there? I can't promise anything, as this is training camp and the start of the season, and he is VERY serious about training. But it's worth a shot if interest is there.[Proof](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/8533_1261443375377_2329273_n.jpg) and [More Proof](http://i.imgur.com/4r7Wg.jpg) 

Edit: I sound like I'm showing off with the long story lol, I'm just wondering if anyone would even care for there to be a AMA for Metta World Peace. 

Edit 2: Ok guys, I just texted his manager and him so I'll let you know if they respond. To all the people bashing me for being an attention whore.... I agree, this was a very attention whoreish post and I'm sorry lol. I also did think it would be a story people would want to hear and enjoy. With that being said, I wasn't doing this for karma (self posts dont get karma) or trying to impress people I don't even know. I really did want to get a general feel for Ron's (Yes I call him Ron, and so does his manager) popularity. I wasn't sure if people absolutely hated him, thought he was a douche, wanted to cuss him out, etc.... I didn't want it to be a disaster for him and waste his and his manager's time. It seems most people love Metta. Anyways, I'll update when there are updates.

""I'm tired of everybody saying he is responsible for them losing. Okay, he had a rough 4th quarter and you have been talking about that all day... He had 39pts. They wouldn't have been in the position to win the game if he hadn't been doing what he had been doing. Overall, he did struggle down the stretch. I think instead of blaming someone, sometimes you have to tip your hat off to the other team. You have to look at how man free throws the Pacers shot, how many points in the paint they shot, how more balanced of a team the Pacers have... I really don't think Melo is the person to blame. Throughout the whole series... he didnt have the best series, but he was more consistent than anybody else on that team. If you are going to blame someone, its certainly not Carmelo Anthony.""

On a personal note: more than that -- we're hitting the final stretch of the season.  It's a glorious time to be a basketball fan.  The battle for playoff seeding is seriously underway.  And for a few unlucky teams, (I'm looking at you, Lakers fans.  Suck it.) dark omens portend ominous futures: futures filled with the dying screams of playoff dreams.  So I'm here to throw down the trash-talk gauntlet and make a prediction: The Jazz will be in the playoffs in 2013.  Everybody's talking about the difficulty of our schedule, and that's right, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  The finest blade is forged in fire.

So what do people mean when they say that the league was watered down for Jordan?

I'm going to do my best to explain and to give you guys a better idea by making modern day equivalencies. They won't be perfect, but I'll do my best.

------------------------------------------------
**EXPANSION:**

When Jordan's Bulls really started to take off it directly coincided with a period of expansion.

In 1988 the NBA added 2 expansion teams (Heat and Hornets). In 1989 they added another 2 expansion teams (Timberwolves and Magic).

Imagine if the NBA decided to add 2 new teams before the start of this season. That would be 2 new teams, who would get to pick at the top of the draft, thus making it harder for the existing bad teams to acquire franchise players, while hurting any franchise players the expansion teams selected by putting them in truly horrible situations.

There would also be an expansion draft, meaning that the 2 expansion teams would get to pick players from existing teams to fill out their roster. Existing NBA teams would get to protect 7 or 8 players, but the rest would all be up for grabs.

How would this benefit a team like the Heat, and a player like LeBron, for example? 

Well, the Heat would easily be able to protect all of their top assets, and top young assets, and seeing as their role players are all comprised of veterans, there is very little chance any of their players get drafted in an expansion draft. An expansion team building for the future isn't going to want to select 38 year old Ray Allen, for example, even though he is a key cog for the Heat.

More likely than not, the players being drafted would be key reserve players from young up and coming teams that could potentially serve as threats to the Heat in the future. It would be a huge blow to a lot of those organizations and would stack the deck for a number of years for already established franchises, like Miami.  

Now imagine that after there was an expansion draft this off-season, there was *another* expansion draft next off-season, that would further rob from the middle and lower tier teams, and again, Miami would remain untouched.

So not only are the Heat remaining the same, or possibly getting better by adding more key veterans, but Miami's competition is getting weaker, and talent league wide is getting further diluted. 

This is basically what happened for Jordan's Bulls.

There was also another expansion draft in 1995, and it's no coincidence that the Bulls won an NBA record 72 games the year the Grizzlies and Raptors were introduced (even though, as Raptors fans will fondly remember, they beat the Bulls that year).

------------------------------------------------------------

**LUCK:**

Now, imagine if the second best player in the NBA other than LeBron who also happens to play on a title contender (Durant) suddenly contracted a life threatening illness and retired well before his time like Magic Johnson did in 1992 (Granted, Magic was a bit older than Durant).

Also imagine the league's best point guard suddenly retired after an injury he could have come back from, well before his time like Isiah did, retiring at only 32 years old (Bye bye, CP3).

Also imagine if a 35 year old legend on a formerly great team's career fell apart due to injuries (Larry, Kobe) and retired.

Now, imagine if a young budding superstar, who might possibly have been LeBron's chief rival died suddenly and unexpectedly (Len Bias and Derrick Rose) before he got a chance to reach his full potential.

Also imagine if the best potential defender of LeBron died in a car accident (Reggie Lewis, Paul George).

So basically, imagine if 2 seasons from now the Heat are the exact same team, playing at the same level. Plus, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, and Paul George are all out of the league. Combine that with 4 expansion teams in 2 seasons (soon to be 6 in a few more years, right as LeBron is hitting the downside of his prime), sapping a number of future contenders of valuable contributors, while also watering down talent league wide, and you have a mix for LeBron and the Heat to go on one hell of a title hording run.

----------------------------------------

**CONCLUSION:**

I think Jordan was GOAT, but no one can deny that he had a hell of a lot of luck on his side. 

In a lot of ways he fell into the absolute perfect position. Granted, he had to make the most of it, and while the league was watered down as a whole, making his path to the finals somewhat easier (particularly during the 2nd 3-peat), there were still a couple of really good teams he inevitably had to beat, and he beat them all. 

Still, if Magic and Isiah aren't forced to retire. If Larry Legend plays out the remainder of his career with health similar to Kobe, if Reggie and Len don't die, and if so many draft picks and role players weren't robbed from decent teams to fill up expansion squads, things might have been different.",,False,,t5_2qo4s,1376239952.0,,Pistons1,True,t3_1k51e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1k51e1/what_people_mean_when_they_say_the_league_was/,

Edit: An AMA request on /r/IAmA must include five questions that are not too general (e.g., what is your favorite color, Steve?) or otherwise it will be removed by the mods. For the sake of quasi-democracy, I'd like to hear from you guys what you'd like to ask him!

Edit 2: Alright, so I'll post a request on /r/IAmA with the following 5 questions...(copy-pasted and randomly picked to ensure pseudo-fairness)

1. How do you feel about being on the lakers, your old rivals?

2. Who is the funniest player you know?

3. Why don't you play basketball in the offseason?

4. We know you take extremely good care of your body. Who in your opinion are the most conditioned athletes in the NBA?

5. With comments made from Raymond Felton indicating he is the top point guard in the league, where would you rank yourself in the league?

I know there are tons of other great questions to ask him, and I hope he can get around to answering them all if/when he does an AMA. :) Thanks for all the great suggestions, guys!

Game 3? Break up the Heat, trade Bosh, the blueprint failed  
Game 4? Bill Simmons ""The Heat are firmly in control""  
Game 5? DANNY GREEN WILL NEVER MISS ANOTHER 3PT SHOT

Time to own up peeps, nobody has any clue what is happening next. Not one person here or in the media predicted any of this. Nobody saw Danny Green coming. Nobody had Ginobili exploding. Nobody had Duncan reduced to the 3rd wheel. Nobody had Mike Miller starting 2 games. Nobody had Lebron going 1-11 in the 2nd half of a Finals game. Nobody had the Spurs deciding they could out tempo the Heat. Nobody had Spo keeping pace with Pop. 

The board and the media are talking like the Heat are dead. Guess what? THE HEAT STILL HAVE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE. In a 2-3-2 they are exactly where they should be and if you asked any Heat fan if they would take 2 games at home to win the title they'd take it.

But isn't that the best part? The uncertainty of every game has been what made this series so riveting (even if the 4th quarter of individual games haven't been). Stop acting like you know what it is going to happen next, because none of us do, and that's when sports are at their best. IMO, this is a great series between 2 very evenly matched teams, 5 or 6 HOFers and 2 coaches that don't make dumb mistakes. You know who wins? Whoever is hottest in the last game.

1373760795.0,827,self.nba,1i8w5w,An Improved 2013/2014 Season Predictor Based on Win Shares,968,141,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1i8w5w/an_improved_20132014_season_predictor_based_on/,"An Improved 2013/2014 Season Predictor Based on Win Shares

My last model had some serious flaws in the code so here are the major improvements:

Win Shares for next season are calculated as the sum of the averages of win shares per 48 of the last three seasons plus the sum of the averages of net changes to win shares per 48 for each player. 2013 minutes are then estimated and multiplied by each player’s win shares per 48 projected. This so called “pie” value is then divided by the total “pie” for the entire NBA to get the fraction of total wins allocated in the NBA each year that player is responsible for. 

Rookie projected win shares are now all based on the NBA comparison players listed on nbadraft.net.

Improvements after the rookie season are scaled back but still remain optimistic for all players as no rookie gets worse. For this reason, the model tends to favor younger teams and is most likely overestimating how good Orlando, Utah, and Charlotte can become with one more year of experience. Then again, it still thinks Ben Gordon is the only shooting guard currently signed on Charlotte’s roster. 

- Injured players still come back at 85% of their previous season’s WS/48

- Rosters used were based on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1i63rl/201314_nba_rosters_so_far/) post so teams like Milwaukee and Atlanta literally don’t have a legitimate point guard, though I gave Dallas Brandan Wright. 

Eastern Conference

Miami 58.94-23.06 (The champs still project as the best team in basketball)

Indiana 52.09-29.91 (A strong offseason for Indy and the return of Granger make them a stronger team than last year)

Chicago 49.89-32.11 (Even with Rose at 85%, the emergence of Jimmy Butler makes them the favorite for the three seed)

Brooklyn 47.28-34.72 (Going to be a super dangerous team to face in the playoffs even if they don’t have the best regular season record especially because their better players will start playing more minutes. The model assumed they will keep Pierce and Garnett fresh for the playoffs by distributing minutes like San Antonio)

New York 43.66-38.34 (Win shares is not a big fan of the Bargnani trade and the lack of minutes for Stat and the retirement of Jason Kidd with no real replacement. God could they use Metta real bad for some serious replacement effect)

Atlanta 38.22-43.78 (Wow, under 500 and still a 6 seed but they could always match that Teague offer to be a slightly better 6 seed)

Toronto 37.42-44.58 (I want to say don’t sleep on Toronto, they’re coming for a seven seed but 37-45 is more of a made playoffs by default than a good season)

Detroit 36.55-45.45 (Hey look, Dumars put together a sub 500 squad but he made the playoffs so he keeps his job)

Cleveland 36.11-45.89 (At least Kyrie goes off to the tune of 7.2 wins produced but they just haven’t addressed the gaping hole at small forward)

 Milwaukee 35.39-46.61 (Bucks nation is waiting with baited breath on the Teague offer and the chance to compete for the 8 seed)

 Washington 33.21-48.79 (Eric Maynor is not a win producer and the front court is really below average. The back court looks nice for the future though.) 

 Boston 32.13-49.87 (Jeff Green is the best player on this team but they really lack a bonified team cancer to get them in the league of the teams truly bottoming out)

 Philadelphia 28.42-53.58 (We all know Philly is trying to be bad and guess what, it appears to be working)

 Orlando 28.33-53.67 (The youth gets a year better but the Orlando Magic starting lineup couldn’t even win their own summer league)

 Charlotte 26.43-55.57 (Even with the Big Al signing, letting Henderson will still leave them as the worst team in basketball)

Western Conference

San Antonio 57.75-24.25 (Would you imagine that, the Spurs are going to do well in the regular season)

LA Clippers 56.28-25.72 (Bringing in Redick and Dudley while retaining Barnes makes this Clippers team deadly next year. Still could use some front court depth) 

Oklahoma City 53.17-28.83 (OKC just keeps losing contributors but the core is still enough for a top three seed)

Memphis 52.36-29.64 (That Koufos deal was sneaky good for Memphis. Also, this projects to be the year Pondexter takes a step forward into the starting rotation.)

Houston 50.43-31.57 (Adding Dwight makes them a 50 win team and contender in the West)

Denver 48.10-33.90 (This offseason has been terrible but if there’s any team with the depth to absorb the losses, it’s Denver. Going to be worse than last year but they aren’t going from the 3 to out of the playoffs)

Dallas 46.11-35.89 (Dallas is starting to look really good on paper but between Caldo, Ellis, and Dirk, I’m not sure who’s going to be stopping the other team from scoring. A real center would be nice though the bench mob had good WS/48 so they probably project better than they actually are.)

Golden State 39.06-42.94 (Jack and Landry were actually really important)

Portland 37.94-44.06 (Hey, they got bench depth but the rest of the west got better just as fast around them)

Utah 37.82-44.18 (If the young guys can keep their old efficiency with heavier minutes, then Utah is poised for a mediocre season, but there’s probably hope in that)

Minnesota 37.80-44.20 (Minnesota should be good but the West is just brutal. They’d still make the playoffs in the East)

 LA Lakers 35.46-46.54 (Kobe will not take less money and he will not let this team be at the front of the lottery)

 New Orleans 34.32-47.68 (There sure is a lot of hype for a team that just lost a decent center and brought in a 2nd tier star who they will play out of position.)

 Sacramento 31.12-50.88 (Luc Mbah a Moute does not mean that your small forward woes are over)

 Phoenix 28.19-53.81 (Bottoming out, no new information here)

**Current Era Recap**

*The Mavericks are a franchise that has been spoiled by success over the course of the recent decade. The franchise was founded in 1980 by Don Carter. The Mavericks three eras can be most aptly defined as follows: a period of semi-relevance and dark-horse playoff contention from 1983-1990 (the highlight of which was Dallas taking the ""Showtime"" Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference Finals in the 1987-88 season), a miserable period of irrelevance from 1990-2000 in which the team failed to make the playoffs even once (reaching an historic low point in 1992 under Richie Adubato in which they opened the season 2-27), and finally; the Mark Cuban/Dirk Nowitzki era (from 2000 until today). During this recent stretch, the Mavericks have qualified for the playoffs in every season but one (which was last year). The three head coaches during this time period were Don Nelson (no defense), Avery Johnson (too much defense), and Rick Carlisle (just right).*

**2012-2013 Season Recap**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup - skip to 2:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcChDBNKSAo)

* This was a particularly painful season for Mavs fans for a couple of reasons; chief among them being injuries to crucial players. By now everyone is probably familiar with the knee issues Dirk had last year to start the season (he missed the first 27 games due to arthroscopic surgery and recovery).

* As always, with an injury of that nature and a player of Dirk's age - even a typically healthy one, he is an iron man as far as veterans are concerned - there is a lengthy reincorporation process for the player to get acclimated to playing at game speed and being in game shape.

* This problem was exacerbated by the fact that Dirk was surrounded by an entirely new group of players and playstyles that he was forced to adjust to on the fly. Dirk is one of the smartest and most savvy players in the league, and surprisingly he was able to make it work to a significant extent (the Mavericks finished the season 28-18; beating the Nuggets, Bulls, Clippers, Hawks, Rockets(2x), Nets, Warriors and Grizzlies during the aforementioned span).

* Marion also missed 15 games including a brutal stretch of eight games down the home stretch in mid-March when we were still clawing for that 8th seed.

* Of course, the second reason the season was painful was that we didn't make the playoffs, as is evident at the top of the post. Last season marked the first time since 2000 that we had missed out on the postseason - and while we consoled ourselves with the fact that our team was able to remain so competitive despite being so utterly devoid of talent and cohesion, it was of little comfort to a franchise accustomed to success.

* Although Dirk has labored (and triumphed, mind you) with supporting casts that are downright laughable in comparison to the murderer's row trotted out by the likes of Miami (and the Clippers/Nets it seems this year), last year's squad was particularly pathetic. Because the Mavs were trying to save up cap space for a marquee free agent like Dwight Howard (oops...), and the front office was unwilling to pay nine figures in luxury taxes (unlike Brooklyn), the team was almost entirely composed of players signed to 1-year deals (Collison, Brand, Kaman) or 2-year deals with player options for the second year (Mayo).

Ah, but alas, a new day is upon us! Let us set gaze to brighter future, and see glory brought to this house once again. ~~Batiatus!~~ Let's go Mavs!

**2013-2014**

There's been a TON of activity on this front for the Mavericks - it's been a busy offseason to say the least. But let's start with the draft.

Dallas had the 13th pick in this year's NBA Draft.  They pulled off a trade with the Celtics to move down to 16 and then a subsequent trade with the Hawks to move down to 18. They also acquired Milwaukee’s 43rd pick via trade with Atlanta. Here’s who they got.

Shane Larkin | PG | University of Miami
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Larkin was the Co-ACC Conference Player of the Year. He also won the Lute Olson Award in addition to being an AP Second Team All-American. Unfortunately, he messed up (read: broke) his ankle during summer ball and will be sidelined for another 8 weeks or so.

Chad Ford's Take: *The Mavs were looking for a point guard with Darren Collison heading into free agency. Larkin is small, but he's an elite athlete, plays the pick-and-roll very well and can really shoot the ball. If he were a little bigger or longer, he would've gone much higher. He's a solid pick here for the Mavs.*

The second pick of the draft for the Mavs was:

Ricky Ledo | SG | Providence
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Ledo was initially taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 43rd pick. This pick was traded to the Hawks, who then traded the pick to the Mavericks in return for Brooklyn's 2014 second-rounder (which Dallas acquired from Boston earlier in the draft) and the rights to Mike Muscala out of Bucknell (whom Dallas drafted on behalf of Atlanta). His biggest knock is that he's had some significant character issues.

Chad Ford's Take: *Ledo has top-10 talent. He's a scoring machine who can really shoot the ball. He slipped after missing the season because the NCAA declared him academically ineligible in addition to numerous off-court issues. If the [Mavs] can rehabilitate him, he has a chance to be this year's Lance Stephenson.*

In the past, the Mavericks have typically sold draft picks at fire sale rates in order to lubricate transactions for veteran role players. But it seems like the front office's approach to the draft is evolving under the specter of the new collective bargaining agreement. I'm really excited about Ledo. He's a 6-6, 200 pound pure athlete who can score at will. If Carlisle can get him to apply himself and buy into the system he would be an absolute theft of a selection.

Now let's get into the free agent market! (Part 2 in comments, ~~Part 3 in comments~~ Part 3 posted here!)

I had never shown this before, since I've got no real proof aside from the story myself and my friends tell. Cellphones at that time didn't have cameras like they do now, at least mine didn't. In this [Video @ 6:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbZoeyngmMM) is a slow-mo replay of the cup in question. Yet I don't need proof to know that what I have in my possession is genuine. Here's the backstory: 

  It was 3 days before my 20th birthday. What better a gift than a Pistons game that was bound to be a tug of war rematch of the previous year's titanic Eastern Conference Finals. Myself, my girlfriend, and my best friend from college had scored amazing seats, in section 115, row CC. Three rows behind the Detroit bench. It was heaven (In a twist of fate, I've sat in that exact row now 4 times since then..). The game itself was a slight disappointment, for a victory wouldve been an excellent early present. I remember Rasheed and Darvin Ham had a particular great game. I despised the Pacers, but respected them utmost. Hell, I was and to this day an enormous Artest/World Peace fan. I think he would've made one hell of a Piston in fact. 
      
  Fast forward to the moments after The Shove. The Detroit bench was surprisingly hostile, and I remember clearly Elden Campbell heightening the situation by making crying sounds, trying to entice Artest or whomever. It was strange, considering I always thought of him as a gentle giant. Anyways, Artest starts to calm down and decides to lay upon the scorers table, about 25 feet from myself and my company. Both benches are standing and shouting at one another. It was getting pretty damn grim. My girlfriend and I were panning the audience, the little that had remained, and everyone's look was that of worry and clairvoyance, as if we all knew that things were going to come to a head. As I was looking to the left of me, one section over and maybe 6 rows back, I witness very obviously a man in blue Pistons garb throw his drink toward the court.(This man has since been identified as John Green). The timing, and aim, couldn't have been more devastating. My girlfriend had seen him toss the cup the exact same time I did. What happens next is one giant cacophony of regret and shame on the part of the mob-mentality fans and players. When Artest started to lunge upon the fans, I recall Rick Mahorn, who was doing the local TV play by play, leap out of his seat and go after Artest and pulled fans away. Mind you this was all occurring no more than 30 feet from us. All the meanwhile the security had hardly any control of the situation, and fans were already entering the court. The entire time, I never took my eyes off the Cup. It was repeatedly kicked and swatted, with no one as much thinking to jump upon it. At one time, when Jermaine ONeal had just slide-punched one fan, he was being restrained by Johnathan Bender and other teammates. During this melee, one of them had managed to kick it (along with many other things that were thrown upon the court) clear across the court and right in front of Larry Brown, who at this time was trying to comfort his son whom was the ball boy. 
     
   Fast forward to about 4 minutes after the players had left for the locker rooms. Mason, the announcer, and other police/security guards were demanding we all leave in a calm fashion as quickly as possible. I had to retrieve that Cup. I had in my mind the idea that if I myself were to get it, I would be pepper sprayed or some sort of force would be taken upon me. So, being the kind hearted gentleman I am, I asked my girlfriend to lunge for it. She obliged immediately, and simply walked down to the court and picked it up. At this point, security was not within 100 feet of us, and the Cup itself was still laying where it had been for a good 10 minutes. She picks it up, still with traces of liquid in it, which was not alcohol but definitely a soda of some sort. She hands it to me, I tell her to place it in her purse. The three of us leave with gusto. 
      
   Now it resides at my father's home. No markings of the chaos, no real authenticity of the event. Just the story that can be vouched by other people, and just maybe video somewhere out there. To this day I refuse to watch footage of the Malice. Just thinking about it makes my eyes well up, I get a lump in my throat and I am overcome with remorse. A lot of things changed that night, most for the better, but the images and stories I ponder from that night will live with me forever, as will this mundane yet infamous article of NBA history.

* Predicted Lakers over Spurs in 6

* Said that the key to that series was the Kawhi vs Pau matchup. (????)

* Said that the only way the Spurs can win against the Grizz is if they score more than 30 points a quarter.

* If the Grizz want to win,  they have to pick up their pace, because clearly a up-tempo offense is what has been winning them games.

That's just during Spurs games. I'm sure there's other idiotic things he's said during other games as well. As long as I'm ranting, I might as well say ESPN needs to find a new NBA crew ASAP. Wilbon's ok, but he seems disinterested at times. Magic says nothing of value during anything, pulling stats and information out of his ass. I hate Jalen Rose's voice; I know that's a shitty reason to him but whatever. And Simmons. I like Simmons when he writes. He clearly has knowledge of the game, but I never see that. And the thing is he respects Jalen and Magic too much too call them out on any of their bullshit. Magic can say whatever the fuck he wants cause he's the greatest PG to ever play. And Jalen and Bill are friends from Grantland, so there's never any arguing between them.

And that's exactly what they need. Arguing. TNT works because Kenny,Chuck, and Shaq respect each other, but aren't afraid to call each other out or disagree with one another. And of course no one's better than Ernie.

TL;DR - Magic pulls things out of his ass, no one calls him out because he's Magic Johnson. And ESPN needs a new halftime/pregame crew

1371454812.0,709,self.nba,1gi5gg,Why the Miami Heat are in serious trouble (long read),922,213,517,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gi5gg/why_the_miami_heat_are_in_serious_trouble_long/,"We’ve all seen the see-saw back and forth from this Heat team throughout the playoffs, so it wasn’t necessarily a surprise that they lost this must win game for SA. And although most will try and not take away too much from this loss, chalking it up to it simply being the nature of the Heat, I personally believe that Miami, for the first time all season, is in serious jeopardy of defending their title. The reason is very simple: They cannot stop this SA offense anymore.


Miami has yet to, this entire playoffs, face a team as elite offensively as SA is. Forget about the SA defense, which has been great, let’s just talk about the SA offense. My god is it on another level.  Entering the finals, there had only been one time the entire postseason where someone broke 100 on Miami and that was in an overtime game by Indiana. The Spurs have already done it 3 times, twice for over 110. Popovich is fully aware now that their defense is going to be there, and now it’s time to blitz Miami’s defense with their offensive execution. Even with the 18 turnovers tonight, SA forced Miami to keep up to **THEIR** scoring pace just to compete. Spo has been forced to play Miller and Allen extended minutes just to keep up with SA’s offense because, as he said “it was survival.” Against this line up, or really any line up Miami threw out, Popovich implored his team to run and challenge the Miami’s defense, forcing their best defenders to be planted on the bench. Miami, who took pride all season by forcing other teams to adjust to them, found themselves on the other end of it tonight.


Miami now faces the same problem that ultimately became Memphis’ undoing: choosing between offense and defense on the wings. Because Chalmers and Battier have been unable to space the floor properly for Wade and Lebron, their minutes have been greatly reduced. Now with Miller and Allen, the Heat’s major problem is on defense, where Danny Green has been lighting them up.  First off, as we all agree, the man is absolutely on fire. It’s literally gotten to the point that we are a little surprised when he misses, ala Steph Curry. Green has been very adept at finding the open space anytime the defense has their attention elsewhere (Parker iso, Duncan iso, Parker/Duncan PnR, etc…). Both Allen and Miller have been caught too many times ball-watching and leaving Green wide-open. The same thing happens whenever Wade is guarding Green as well because Wade is a roamer. The same gift that makes him an incredible weak-side defender and “free safety”, blowing up passing lanes and disrupting the SA offense, is what leaves his own man completely open to exploit the Heat. Given how hot Green has been, this has become inexcusable. Yes, I understand their unwillingness to let Parker destroy them in the pick and roll, but perhaps that needs to be reconsidered giving how SA is shooting the 3s. Miami got away with it in game 4 simply because Wade was otherworldly as a “free safety” by generating 6 steals. But for the majority of the series, he’s repeatedly been caught in poor help defense position, trying to contain Parker/Ginoboli, only to give Green a wide open 3 pointer. So unless Battier and Chalmers 3 point shot returns to form, and Wade stops roaming, Green is going to get his open looks again in game 6. 


The starting lineup that SA threw out tonight is likely going to be the same 5 that starts out in game 6. If that’s the case, Miami is in serious trouble. There is not one weakness in that small lineup for SA on either end of the floor. Not one. Every single man is both a capable offensive and defensive player. 
Furthermore, Miami’s defense has excelled at taking away the first option passing lanes for teams and forcing them to use precious time to determine what the next best option is. So what’s wrong now? SA’s offense is so well run and has such great passers (Parker/Ginoboli/Diaw/Duncan) that they are able to find that next pass without too much difficulty. Miami has yet to face a point guard in the playoffs with Parker and Ginoboli’s ability to get into the paint and destroy the help defense. Miami, who thrived all year on their ability to rotate in time to cover the 3 point shooters, simple can’t against this SA offense. The shooters move too well off the ball and Parker and Manu are too good at finding them for Miami to cover them in time. Add in the Heat’s attention to Duncan, and there’s just no way for the Heat to take away all of SA’s options. 


All season long the Heat have forced opponents to play small, knowing that no one could compete. But for the first time all season, there is another team playing smallball better than them. Minus the game 4 explosion, The 3 headed monster of Green-Leonard-Ginoboli on the wing has matched up against the Lebron and Wade duel. Adding in the shooting of Neal and passing of Diaw off the bench, and SA’s offense doesn’t miss a beat at any second of the game. There is no time for the Heat to take possessions “off” from defense against this particular SA team.  


Miami survived game 4 from a combined superhuman effort from Lebron, Wade, and Bosh (and a hobbled second half Parker). Can they do it again? Sure, of course they COULD do it again. Is it likely, that the Heat get that top of production on both ends from ALL 3? Hell, are the Heat even going to get a double digit rebounding game from Bosh again this series? And to be completely honest, even if Miami’s big 3 shows up to 90% of what they did in game 4, can they even beat tonight’s SA team? Miami stepped up to a new level this season because of the leap from their role players. Where are those guys now? Battier’s shot has almost completely abandoned him this series to the point that he’s contemplating retirement. Norris Cole was abused so hard by Tony and Manu that Spo played him only 7 minutes. Mario “the GOAT” Chalmers has shot 31% this series. The Birdman must’ve been stuck in the bird cage because he didn’t play a single second in game 5. 


What was once a team challenging the title of “greatest team of all time” and “fo fo fo fo” has now been reduced to one loss from elimination. What was once the promise of “not one, not two, …” is one loss away from a summertime of what’s next. What was once deemed the next dynasty is one loss awau from the final villain in Duncan’s 5 championship legacy. Lebron, who finally broke out of being the butt of all jokes to have a regular season for the ages, is one loss from a tarnish on his legacy that can never be recovered. Miami has 48 hours to figure out to how to stop the best offensive team that it has encountered in the last 3 years. Whatever happens, I can’t wait for game 6. And this is coming from a fan not rooting particularly for any side. 


**EDIT**


It’s nice to see the discussion here as we all eagerly anticipate for game 6. I just want to add that by no means am I saying SA has this thing locked up, it’s just that the problem at hand is not as simple as a case of playing “better or harder” for Miami. The big 3 played very well in game 5, and offensively Miami wasn’t that bad. It’s going to be a case of stopping the SA offense that is the problem.



Consider the following.  Everyone, myself included, said that:


Game 1: SA won’t have another 4 turnover game

Game 3: SA won’t have another 16 3 point game

Game 5: SA won’t shoot 60% from the field

While all of this is true, SA just needs one more good offensive game. Is a 12 turnover, 50% fg shoot, 10 3 pointer game really out of question for SA?  Will Miami's offense be good enough as well to combat a game like this from SA?

First of all, **Dwight's a bitch.**

Second, the NBA superstar culture is enabling his bitch ass antics. Look at the Dwightmare, we thought maybe it was just due to him being indecisive that made him look so bad, and that a change of scenery would fix everything. 

Even through all of the Dwightmare, teams were stepping up left and right to fellate him just for a one year rental with no long term commitment, ready to give up asset after asset. He is Top 3, game changing player, I'll admit, but still, with every passing day of the Dwightmare you could see more trouble in the water with this guy.

So the Lakers ended up with him. We heard it all:  ""more championships, no parity in the league, we need to contract teams because its just nor fair"". But this is not to bash the lakers, I've done that enough until the next time they lose. This is about Dwight.

Bringing score sheets around the locker room and media like some twisted show and tell type shit? Really my nigga? You only got how many shots? How about Pau, which is worlds better offensively having to play second fiddle to you, when you have no post moves, Linus Caldwell might as well be your opponent the way you get stripped, and you can't shoot free throws!! I wouldnt give you the damn ball either!!!

Talking bout ""Let's stay together guys, we have to stay together, everybody be friends"" when you're throwing your guys under the bus because you havent improved your weaknesses and its bringing everybody else down. Now your frontcourt mate has no morale because he has  to sacrifice to make you happy just like he did last year, but at least Bynum could score and doesn't look like a big ass whale out of water doing post moves to the basket.

You pushed a coach to his limits and ultimately got him fired because he felt he didnt deserve to put up with your Bullshit. Now you're one of the main reasons a historic franchise is being destroyed from the inside out.

You got a free throw at two different franchises and went 0 for 2 on both chances. But hey,  your pretty familiar with that arent you?

As diehard Mavericks fans, we have a tradition of buying our three sons tickets to the Bobcats/Mavericks game for Christmas every year.  I’m not sure we can afford to continue this tradition.

Two years ago we made the trip (Great game, Mavs won!), halfway home, the motor in our van blows up.  In the middle of hillbilly gulch.  I swear I heard banjos.  Walk miles to get to an exit.  Buy new van.

Last year, the strike kept the Mavs out of Charlotte.  Disappointment was as thick as a London fog.

This year, redemption.  Mavs coming to town on a weekend!  We splurged, got five new Mavs shirts from MavGear.com to wear, and bought floor seats.

After 3-1/2 hours of driving, just 30 minutes from the arena, we get caught up in a multi-car accident.  No serious injuries, thank goodness, but a totaled van, bruised/broken ribs for me and my wife (kids are apparently a lot tougher than us old folks), $65 taxi fare to the Hertz place, $275 for a ONE DAY VAN RENTAL from Hertz to get my family home, $288 ticket (all of the vehicles involved got the same ticket, failure to reduce speed to avoid accident), insurance will no doubt skyrocket, and my wife and I will miss at least a few days of work because it hurts to even breathe right now, much less move.  And 5 floor seat tickets in my pocket that sat empty all night.

Next year….when the Mavs come to Charlotte….

We’ll be there.

Go Mavs.

I did a January AMAA about high school/college scouting [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/16ztry/iama_basketball_scout_for_college_and_nba_teams/) in /r/collegebasketball, and as I've been consulting on this year's NBA Draft, I wanted to talk with you guys about that on here.

As with the AMAA I did in January, I intend to answer every question I possibly can. I can't really talk about specific conversations I've had with teams, but that's about it I think. I'll come back to answer any more questions that pop up throughout the week too.

I'll be here awhile. I'm recording some video with Coach Nick's bballbreakdown YouTube channel later today. You'll get to watch that this week too.

Let's talk about prospects and the Draft!

AMAA!

EDIT: It's 4:35 Eastern, 1:35 Pacific. Got to answer A LOT of questions. I need to start getting ready to record video for bballbreakdown. I'm going to try to get to every other question over the next couple days.

EDIT2: I guess I lied. After ten minutes, I came back and started responding to more questions. Still here...

EDIT3: It's almost 9 PM Eastern. I went through the whole thread and I think I answered every question. I'll keep responding to any questions that pop up.

I recorded some video with Coach Nick of bballbreakdown a little while ago, and we're doing more tomorrow. Stay tuned for that this week.

I really appreciate everyone who participated and those who read along today.

1363543004.0,678,self.nba,1ah2av,A good story about Dwight Howard. Maybe he's not so bad?,875,197,276,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ah2av/a_good_story_about_dwight_howard_maybe_hes_not_so/,"Found this on [Pacersdigest.com](http://www.pacersdigest.com/showthread.php?82216-Something-nice-to-say-about-Dwight-Howard)

&gt; At half time Dwight was one of the first players out of the locker room for shoot around, he stood in the tunnel and watched the Red Panda Acrobat do her thing and gave her a standing ovation when she left.

&gt; Anyway after she exited the floor Dwight came onto the court and got a ball from a ball boy, who btw he shook his hand and thanked him. He then took a couple of jumpers when someone yelled something to him from over by where McKey sits at games. Dwight pointed at them and they both laughed that person then came over &amp; he and Howard shook hands and hugged so I assume he knew the guy.  **Dwight turns to walk away when he spots a little man jumping up and down in the 3rd row. Kid was probably anywhere from 8-10 and yes he was wearing a Lakers Howard jersey. Dwight stops in his tracks and walks over to the kid and throws him the ball. I actually thought he was giving the kid the basketball to keep as he walked toward the aisle with it but he then turned and walked to the court where Dwight let him come on the floor and shoot three shots. Afterwards he and the kid slap five and the kid floats (because he was just so damned happy) back to his seat with his Mom (at least I think it is his Mom) who has been taking photo’s and is now yelling “Thank you” to Howard.**

&gt; I’ve been going to games since 1985 &amp; I can tell you that I have never seen a superstar player so fan friendly and it’s just a real shame that he is now a villain for what he did to the Magic.

The idea is that a bet is made (pitting the glory of your team against that of another, calling how many games a certain series will go to, who will progress to the conference finals or anything else you can think of) between two redditors and the loser pays out a pre-determined amount to a pre-determined charity. 

It's fun, you get to gloat afterwards and the losers don't really lose - the charities you pick definitely win. 

Personally, I'd keep the monetary values low, but higher value bets are acceptable!

The sub had a little interest around the soccer transfer window, but I'd like to expand it and playoffs seem like a perfect time to do that. 

I'll throw out an opening bet (to be accepted by one person only!) that Knicks will beat Celtics in the opening round of playoffs. As I said before, low bets for me, so let's say £5 to the charity of the person who accepts this bet. **Bet accepted by /u/R33V3R13**

If there's enough interest, I'll make some other bets too!

* ""Missing free throw 1 of 1""
* ""Making free throw 1 of 1""

Since the play-by-play stats are available for all finals games, searching for **""Free throw 1 of 1""** would indicate if a shooting foul was committed while the basket was made (with the exception of a technical foul).
