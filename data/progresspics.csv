I was a reddit newbie and stumbled across the sub and started looking at all the wonderful before/ after pics...reading their stories, it seemed so simple...just count calories??? I thought maybe I would give it a try and maybe this would be the thing to finally stick....turns out it did!

Hello! 

In about a year, I lost a little over 80 pounds. I decided I was sick and tired of always being tired (out of breath) and just feeling awful about myself. I've always struggled with my weight but now I feel great! I eat much smaller meals, I joined a gym and I cut out soda completely. Water became my new best friend. I thought I'd share my before and after pictures, as I'm always lurking around here looking at yours. :-) 

I'm still working on my body, mainly toning right now and I'm hoping to lose a couple more pounds but I'm not in any rush. I just enjoy being able to keep up with my kids now.

[updated weight loss gallery](http://imgur.com/a/XC97g)

I posted here [4 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/qwjqj/i_can_see_the_finish_line/), and my weight loss has only been another 13 lbs in the last 4 months, but the difference between 160 and 147 is pretty staggering for me. For the first time in my life I can see my actual shape peeking out and look damn fit! What? Love it.

I was a chronic overeater and addicted to sugar for most of my life, to break the cycle I had to do keto very seriously for the first couple of months, weighing measuring logging tracking everything I could. After that I continued tracking but would eat more carbs. I also do intermittent fasting where I only eat between noon and 8 and found that to be very comfortable and easy way to continue my weight loss. 

This summer I've been kind of on a plateau because I've been indulging in more crap... but I'm still improving in my running to balance it out. At the end of august I plan on diving into another month of Keto to ""reset"" my metabolism again and cut the last of the fat to get down to 137 lbs.

Went on holiday with my BF last August, and realised for the first time just how much I hated my body. Was going through some heart complaints previously and warned off any high resistance exercise, so as soon as the all clear was given, I went mental! Daily cardio to start off with, mixed with a healthy diet (mainly sushi and greens). Over the past few months I've started lifting, and am loving my new muscles. 

Still a long way to go - want to lose another stone and get some more tone. Not as strict on diet anymore and am struggling not to eat naughty things now that I'm happy ... how do you all abstain?

Thanks to everyone for the inspiration!

I made a throwaway because I am kind of embarrassed about sharing this but I've been working pretty hard so I thought I would give it a shot. 

I went from 194lbs to 172lbs by running 4-6 days a week(around 3 or 4 miles a day), doing a combination of Weight Watchers and MFP and lifting weights 3-4 days a week. I lost the majority of the weight over the summer and when I got back to college the weight loss stalled a lot. Late night snacking and sugary temptations are my undoing! I've continued to work out so I haven't gained a ton back but I definitely am not done losing. My goal is to lose around 20 pounds more and then work on getting more toned.

I have just begun keto about a week ago in hopes of shedding the fat in my leg and arm areas (my problem areas!) I'm a little worried about how keto will affect my running since I have become a pretty avid runner but we shall see!

I grew up in an obese family and never really *saw* what I was doing to myself until this moment. [""Moment""](http://i.imgur.com/QL3bv.jpg).
I just felt absolutely... fat. It was disgusting. 



Last January I really kicked myself into gear. I needed to change. I downloaded myfitnesspal to my phone and started tracking calories. I limited myself to 1400 calories a day and exercised when I could. I lost the first 30 pounds and fell off the bandwagon- didn't gain any back though. 



Now I'm back at it and feel super successful. I eat 1200 calories a day and I'm doing 30 minutes of eliptical with 5x5 over head press, squats, rows, bench, and deadlifts 3-4 times a week. Yesterday I weighed in at 218. That's the lowest I have ever weighed in my (young)adult life. I'm so proud. :)


I fit into a dress size 18!! holy shit! :) Just wanted to share and help any others out there who are struggling and need motivation.


I'm new to this subreddit but I'm excited to stick around! Thank you for reading!
