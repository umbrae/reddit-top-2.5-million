The NDAA is unconstitutional and unlawful and there is **no** arguing that.

If it passes, protesters may be deemed ""low-level terrorist"" by our current government. They may be threatened, interrogated or possible killed by our own military for standing up for our Constitution.

I hope the history books will tell our kids and our kids kids of the brave people who stood up for what was right and brought about a change in this nation.  

Lets all hope history will stop repeating itself at some point.

I don't expect you to believe me. I want you to read this, take it with a grain of salt, and do the research yourself. You may not believe me, but I want your movement to succeed. From a former tea partier to you, young new rebels, there's some advice to prevent what happened to our now broken movement from happening to you. I don't agree with everything your movement does, but I sympathize with your cause and agree on our common enemy. You guys are very intelligent and I trust that you will take this in the spirit it is intended.

I wish I could believe this Occupy Wall Street was still about (r)Evolution, but so far, all I am seeing is a painful rehash of how the corporate-funded government turned the pre-Presidential election tea party movement into the joke it is now. We were anarchists and ultra-libertarians, but above all we were peaceful. So, the media tried painting us as racists. But when that didn't work they tried to goad us into violence. When that failed, they killed our movement with money and false kindness from the theocratic arm of the Republican party. That killed our popular support.

I am sharing these observations, so you guys know what's going on and can prevent the media from succeeding in painting you as violent slacker hippies rebelling without a cause, or from having the movement be hijacked by a bunch of corporatists seeking to twist the movement's original intentions. If you think this can't happen, it happened to the Independence Party and the tea party movement. Don't let it happen to your movement as well.

Here's how they turned our movement into a bunch of pro-corporate Republican Party rebranding astroturf, and this is how I predict they are turning your movement into a bunch of pro-corporate Democratic party rebranding astroturf. I believe many of these things are already happening, so take note.

1- The media will initially and purposely avoid covering your dissenting movement to cause confusion about what your movement is about within mainstream audiences. It might feel like this is to enrage you and make you appear unreasonable.  Perhaps you will feel even invisible.

2- While the obsfuscation is happening, stooges will infiltrate and give superficial support, focus and financial backing to the targetted movement. In the tea party movement's case, it was the religious Republicans and Koch Brothers. In this case, it's many unions that cozy up to the Democratic Party (the organizations as quasi-human entities, not the members themselves) and Ultra Rich liberals who pretend to care, but frankly do not serve liberators and freedom seekers but rather the interests of some union leaders and the Democratic Party.  Democrat, Republican, these parties are all part of the same corporate ruling system.  Case in point: http://www.debates.org/

3-The media will cover the movement only after this infiltration succeeds. Once the infiltration is completed the MSM will manufacture public media antipathy towards the movement by using selective focus on the movement's most repulsive elements or infiltrators on the corporate Conservative media side, while the corporate Liberal media will create a more sympathetic tragic hero image -- this is the flip side of the tea party, but same media manipulation tactics. I go into greater detail on this tactic: http://vaslittlecrow.com/blog/2011/09/08/how-the-media-and-ideological-groups-manipulate-your-beliefs/

4- Someone in the Democratic Party will feign sympathy for the movement and falsely ""non-partisan"" entities provide tons of funding and unwanted organization, just as was done with the tea party movement by Republicans. Once people assume that the pro-corporate government operatives are their friends, they will hijack the movement and the threat of your movement will be neutralized.

If this new Occupy Wall Street movement is to survive, here's what needs to be done.

1- Loudly denounce violence and disavow the violent rabblerousers of the movement. They do not help the cause.

2- Be image conscious. Present your best face and call out those who act like fools within the movement. People are more likely to pay attention to you in your Sunday dress and bringing homemade food, than when you are drinking a bottle of Snapple and chomping on Big Macs while you are looking like a slacker rich hipster/unwashed hippie stereotype.

3- Accept that you've already been infiltrated by the corporate-funded government, and work hard to say, and state what your movement is and is not about. ""No, this isn't about unions or liberals, conservatives or bored spoiled brats. This is about 99% of our population being exploited and manipulated for the sake of profit."" ""No we will not resort to violence."" ""Yes, all we want is for for the end of government collusion with corporate entities that are illegitimately recognized as people."" And, so forth...

4- Don't forget who you are as the illusions are thrown at you. Corporatists are masters of illusions. That's the most powerful weapon they have. That's how they sell products you don't need and convince you to justify accepting atrocities for the sake of products Don't fall for it. Otherwise, your cause will be lost. Be wary of large donations from special interest groups or non-profit corporations that were not involved this movement from the inception. Special interests groups are not your allies. Non-profit corporations are still corporations, and unfortunately, too many of them care more about donations than doing the right thing. Killing a movement with kindness is easy.

5- Remain independent and focused. If you can, pick a face to represent your movement. Rosa Parks wasn't just a random lady in a bus. http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/systems/agentsheets/New-Vista/bus-boycott/ -- She was chosen. You too can use the power of illusion against those who oppose you.

6- On the web, you can prevent a lot of hijacking simply by checking the small print, or going to the about pages of a group or individual.  Non-profits and political action groups are legally obligated to disclose a lot of things, and you need to be aware of this.  If the information is nowhere to be found, do a whois page.  Image searches can also be helpful.  Examine who is posing with whom. Company owner? Where is that company located? Did they have a convention/charity event?

7- If you hear people who you know are part of the machine saying stuff like,  ""Progressives need to be more like the tea party,"" don't accept it on face value.  Always follow the money, study past statements and groups they claim to be part of. If such people are suddenly telling you to emulate organizations that they once consistently denounced as evil or racist, without any rhyme or reason, they are lying to you. 

I wish your movement better luck than we had with the tea party movement before it got hijacked by the theocrats and corporatists. We used to be non-partisan too. We were the older version of you. But, I believe that as the media apparatchik and infiltrators start to twist your cause, you will understand the frustration us early adopter tea partiers felt and that we were not your enemy after all. A fascist oligarchy on the verge of winning is our common enemy. This should be your focus. Don't be dazzled by the illusion as we were. For the sake of our future, know who you are.

Thank you for reading. I would love to read your ideas on the subject.  Correct me where I am wrong.  Explain what is going right.  This is ultimately your fight.


EDIT: To understand how movements get hijacked, check out this fantastic video that JamesCarlin shared: http://vimeo.com/20355767

**tl;dr** Hibernator's excellent and much less paranoid sounding summary below:

""Someone starts a movement. It starts small, and there's a lot going on in the world, so the mainstream media gives it minimal coverage. Today's mainstream media is also understaffed, so they don't investigate and they wait for someone else to slap a label on it.

Eventually a sound byte X pops up above the noise and the mainstream media uses this to engage viewers and define the movement. This defining characteristic X spreads like a meme.

People in power now notice what's going on, and think to themselves ""Hmm, this new movement is defined by X, and that's almost in line with my goals, so maybe I can use them to further my ends.""

But people in power are all labelled as Democrats or Republicans, so now the media applies the polarizing filter of American politics to associate movement X with one of the parties.

The original movement has now been labelled X, and associated with a political party, and none of this happened because of any 'government conspiracy.' It just happened because that's what you get as output when you plug something new into the American political system.""

The prosecutor and judge refused to allow the contract we had with the city to be allowed into evidence. The jury deliberated for 2.5 hours! They were hung for quite some time 4 for guilty and 2 for not guilty. They found me guilty and set the fine at...$1. I think that speaks volumes. My attorney asked for time served in lieu of the court costs of $74 and the judge refused that as well. My attorney and I will be appealing this to the county court now based on principle alone. We will subpoena the city manager as well as others on the city council.    
     
I refuse to lay down and just take what the city is doling out.  I do not think they had any right to evict us from the park and I will fight it to the end.

EDIT:  Thanks you guys, I appreciate all the support, it's been a long, draining and exhausting day.  I have to work a double tomorrow but will respond to any more comments and/or questions tomorrow night when I return home for work.  For any of you who are considering fighting your charges, please do!  Feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss your cases and want my perspective.     
         
EDIT #2:  Just a side note on how ludicrous the prosecutor was being - I had left at 9PM with 4 other occupiers to go to a drum jam off site for a couple of hours.  We got word at 10:30 that we could be getting raided soon so we all jumped in my car and got back as soon as we could.  I couldn't get within about 4 blocks of the camp because all the roads were blocked off.  The prosecutor mentioned on numerous occasions and in her closing statement, ""If you're a protester, why wouldn't you be there protesting, why would you leave to be entertained?  I don't understand how you can say you're protesting if you aren't there.""  Apparently, for 43 days straight, I wasn't supposed to leave the camp.  She never said shit about me leaving for work and school, though.  Nor leaving camp to use the bathroom.      
        
EDIT #3:  For any and all who are interested, my attorney is Daniel Sullivan in Dallas, TX and his office number is 469-547-1168. He is a great attorney with a huge heart who is professional and a supporter of those who are oppressed by the system.       
       
EDIT #4:  Some have been asking so here's the info:  the judge on my case was Julie Clancy and the prosecutor was [Stacie S. White](http://texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Find_A_Lawyer&amp;template=/Customsource/MemberDirectory/MemberDirectoryDetail.cfm&amp;ContactID=303259).

What happened to Scott Olsen was obviously terrible, and the cops responsible should go to jail.

But people trying to use this to turn the OWS movement into some kind of anti-police movement will destroy OWS if they succeed.

The wider public have a lot of time for the core messages of OWS, but I can assure you they have no time whatsoever for people who are generally opposed to the rule of law, or in favor of anarchy.

I live in Austin TX and the OWS movement here seem to have a great relationship with the police.  If they didn't, people here would have very little time for them.

tl;dr: If OWS make the police their enemy, they lose.

Even CNN is whitewashing their own coverage from yesterday, and they were doing the best half assed coverage of the major networks yesterday!  

  In the morning, protestors showed up at Liberty Plaza/Zuccotti Park at 7AM.  When at least 1,000 protestors were there they marched to various blockaded intersections near the NYSE.  They tried to disrupt people getting to work and engaged in various peacefully ""disruptive"" tactics which were sometimes dealt with less than peacefully by the police.

Here are some clips you won't see on the news:

Here is a *beautiful* angled shot of the incident:

This is the video CNN, Fox, MSNBC, and others were showing in response to the reported hair pulling incident when they mentioned it throughout the day.

Reuters is also having ""technical difficulties"" regarding OWS videos.  CNN and Reuters are far from alone in this:

I am certain there are many more videos of this part of the day, but no major network was anywhere near this action, except Russia Today if you consider them a major news source.  CNN, seemed to be the only ones putting in a morning effort and they just hung out near the empty Zuccotti Park.

The protestors decided to reassemble at Liberty Plaza/Zuccotti Park. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AykRe2ECu4I

After the park had slowly filled up, because police bottlenecked the park through one entrance, protestors took down the barricades and reclaimed the park:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRNXttY6_Xc

Here's a CNN video that still plays:

http://www.youtube.com/user/cnn?blend=1&amp;ob=4#p/u/23/GG0xPfi5nSs

The police flipped their shit, called in riot police and pretty much any reinforcements they could:

Police attack protestors with barricades:

(can't find it, but it was on CNN yesterday)

The police surrounded the already barricaded and penned in park and tensions mounted.  Then the police engaged in ""snatch and grab"" tactics, going for protestors who are more visible members whom they keep thinking are ""leaders"".  

This is how the tactic is being used against Occupy Wall Street:
Large numbers of police surround the protestors at any time, sometimes a hundred, sometimes several hundred.  TARU, HMS, and various other law enforcers video tape the protests and pick out people they think are leaders.  Taking out leaders should slow things down, plus they get to start up files of these people and interrogate them.  During briefings, the police are told, ""when you have the order and the opportunity, take these people.""  These are some of the people you see arrested when police seem to pick and choose from all the protestors they want to arrest.  Really, any videos of ""mass arrests"", like the others I posted here, show who the ""visible protestors"" are who get confused with ""leaders"".  The police often target these highly ""visible protestors"" when they target individuals out of hundreds. 

Here's a mass arrest example:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVStSG2Lx-k

Does this guy look familiar?  He was the last person to use the old bullhorn before we started using the much slower peoples' mic.  Here's his first arrest photo for using the bullhorn.

He was also a ""visible protestor"" in Steven Colbert's satirical interviews:

http://occupywallst.org/article/ketchup-and-justin-foil-colbert-optation/

There are MANY examples of other ""visible protestors"" being arrested online if you look.

Protestor thrown over Zuccotti Park barricade.  I don't know when this was (probably around the Zuccotti conflict), but it sucked for that guy, I'm sure:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzfcJqV6uks

After the police retook the park by force, everyone decided to go off on other actions.  The most publicized were when protestors went into subway stops to ask people to join up for the rally at Foley and the march across the Brooklyn Bridge.  News outlets were erroneously reporting we were going to shut down the subways and cause chaos.  The truth is that protestors effectively used the subways to bring tens of thousands of people to Foley Square.  They did not want to shut them down!

Fox News reported subway chaos more than most, but all networks reported plans for subway chaos/shut downs:

http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1281472607001/protesters-to-rally-on-subways-city-hall-and-bkln-bridge

This is what protestors did, this was the Occupy Subways plan all along:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk8pPkdgHLc

Another.  There are more, but I'm running out of space here.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBvyFvs307Y

Protestors have done similar things many times before as an outreach action.  We truly aren't the violent anarchists we have been smeared as being.  There are more videos than this of different people occupying on different days, just look around:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXfylbl_bVM

Here's Mr Kill Money a month ago ""Occupying the Subway"":

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpOj-WScQh0

Well, after all the occupations of subways, which were not violent BTW, tens of thousands of protestors rallied at Foley Square. There was Hip Hop:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGetw-06kio

Some more footage of larger than reported crowds from the ground:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaTfWZrXODU

Protestors listening to police scanners heard the police estimate was 30,000 protestors.  CNN reported it and showed helicopter shots.  I found some some videos are being blocked or buried.  Maybe they'll come out later today with a little *nudging*, but the morning media… even CNN, is completely whitewashed.  Maybe we'll see a change in the news story tonight, maybe not.

Here's one screen cap of the helicopter footage.  The helicopter did pan around and show a crowd of tens of thousands, who all rallied there from various parts of the city, gathered together through Occupy Subways, which was to use the subways effectively to protest.. NOT shut them down.

http://occupywallst.org/article/november-17-historic-day-action-99/

Hey, look!  I found the helicopter footage without Candy Crowley's commentary!  It took a few hours... it was so buried, ridiculous!:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHjS2r55L_k

This was projected on the Verizon building for people crossing the Brooklyn Bridge to see. Many cars honked in solidarity.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxG4g62rnd8

Keith Olberman has some good footage near the end of this video.  I get the feeling he saw what I did, but didn't record it before the chopper was told to buzz off.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NRirhZffgc&amp;feature=related

I will try to find more video evidence of the day's events.  

Hopefully I did a better job than the morning news shows compiling this information for you.  It is unfortunate the major networks are blocking and burying many of the videos I saw them run live yesterday.  There is much more compelling evidence, but it's being censored.

For your entertainment, here is a good article about the Fox News smear campaign, just for shits and giggles.

http://mediamatters.org/research/201111160003?frontpage

Anyway, morning news, no mention of all the people who rallied at Foley Square. There were so many people it took hours to cross the Brooklyn Bridge because the queue was so long. Most people stayed on the pedestrian walkway, and apparently CNN became so disgusted by the mostly peaceful protest they covered ALL DAY, that they removed or blocked most of their footage and snubbed OWS all morning. I can't even find mirrors! All that is being reported is 400 and some odd arrests, 7-10 cops with such severe injuries as finger stitches and vinegar splashes. Oh, and the increasing verbal smears.

Please help me fill in the blanks of the day with videos?

Their excuse is that it must have been a computer malfunction.  If that is the case please explain why:

Just moments before the sprinklers came on, a police SUV drove past, called the officers over, then the officers crossed to the other side of the street.

When the protestors attempted to block the sprinkler by putting a bucket over it, an officer confiscated the bucket and drove off playing ""La Cucaracha"" on his PA.

Many of the protestors have no place where they can go to get dry and warm, and the police confiscated most of their blankets and sleeping bags in a raid a few days ago, so turning the sprinkler on them in freezing temperatures could literally have been a fatal sentence for exercising their first amendment rights.  The sprinkler over-sprays onto the sidewalk where the protestors were assembled since they are trying to cooperate and stay out of the park itself as local ordinance requires between the hours of 11:PM and 7AM.  Not to mention that watering the lawn in Denver in October is a waste of water, could lead to frozen and burst pipes, and root rot on the lawn.

If you wish to express your feelings on this matter, you can leave a message for Mayor Hancock at 720-865-9090.

EDIT for updates and clarifications:
My wife talked to someone with the city today.  They claim that the sprinkler would normally be shut off by this time of year, but they have it on due to re-sodding areas of the park.  They gave her a schedule for the sprinkler system.  I failed to mention that this occurred at 1:00 AM, so even though it was warm here today it was very cold last night (and will be again tonight).  The temperature I mentioned is approximate; the temperatures last night did reach freezing, which would be 32 Fahrenheit or less (0 Centigrade) but I don't know exactly what the temperature was at 1:00 AM.",,False,self,t5_2sn7r,True,,,True,t3_lho2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/lho2e/denver_turns_sprinklers_on_protestors_in_30/,

The City, if nothing else, is concerned with ass-covering.  No agency is immune.  It runs from the top official down to the cop on the beat.  You have a family to support, lawyers are stalking, so you *always* cover your ass.

Until now.

So complete is the tunnel vision of the city to squash any vector which may pose a threat to property value, that for one brief, blissful municipal-blink-of-an-eye, numerous agencies have apparently decided life is too short to spend it on ass-covering.

Carpe diem, but keep your eye on the prize.

If you can station 200 police at a park ahead of a rally for public safety reasons, you can put *one* ambulance there.  If it's a big enough deal to blow all that money on riot police overtime, it's a big enough deal to have a medical professional nearby.

Too much?

Ok.  Just *one* EMT with a field kit.

Still too much?

How about Just clearing even a *single* certified (or un-certified) medical professional to cross police lines in the event of an emergency with *one* individual.

Still too much?

The city cares more about squashing protest than public safety, and it is probably not politically motivated.  It could be some misguided attempt at protecting delicate ears of financial elites.  It could just be about property value.

Edit3:  Nurse and redditor philosophicfruitfly points out that the police in Detroit turned a crew of volunteer nurses away.  So I guess we can add ""how about not turning away certified medical professionals"" to the above city auto-denial list.

Edit2:  Thanks to EMT and Occupy supporter jerry8135 for pointing out that the police actually *are* the trained medics I lament the absence of.  Who knew? Though, apparently, they are [not required](http://mobile.gothamist.com/2010/09/08/parents_rally_for_brianas_law.php) to be periodically retrained or certified.  There is some legislation which has been introduced to require NYPD to be retrained periodically after a case last year where an NYPD officer refused to give CPR to a girl who died.  True to Commissioner Ray Kelly's record, he denied an NYPD officer had been the culprit, and later scapegoated the officer for rightly refusing to do something he was not qualified to do.  Its hard to find detailed info about the NYPD policy.  I am citing one weekly, so, any additional research is welcome.

I don't want this to be a cop bashing festival.   City policy priorities are the issue here, not individuals.

If you identify any officers not listed here, please take a screenshot and let me know in this thread, and I'll update the list. I suggest you download the highest quality videos you can (use www.keepvid.com or something similar) and go through them frame by frame until we have all names and badge numbers. If you have any video or photos of yesterdays brutality, please upload them immediately, even if you don't think it's much. You'll be surprised what a single frame can show the world. As always, stay peaceful.


**Edit***

I'm in the process of gathering links to all videos where names and badge numbers are clearly visible. I'll post them when I'm finished.

**Edit****

Here's a list of their names which link directly to the video they appear in. I tried to link directly to where the name is best visible, but you may have to download the video to see it more clearly since youtube doesn't really let you skip frame by frame like quick time will.

1326600800.0,710,self.occupywallstreet,ohm0i,"BREAKING NEWS: Road2Congress group(Occupy Greyhound) was removed by police in Amarillo, TX because driver Donald Ainsworth ordered ""all protesters off the bus""",1025,315,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/ohm0i/breaking_news_road2congress_groupoccupy_greyhound/,"Donald Ainsworth immediately began yelling at all passengers in the lobby.  Once he realized 13 passengers were with Occupy he began making personal and rude comments towards members when boarding with tickets. No one responded. Once the bus was boarded he began shouting ""Sit down and shut up! Anyone standing is getting kicked off the bus."" Several passengers, not just Occupants, began addressing the driver's conduct. He left the bus, and locked all passengers within for over an hour. He made a lengthy phone call and before too long the police had arrived. The officer came on the bus and spoke with us, stating he knew Don's attitude was poor but he had the right to remove us. After everyone agreed to be quiet, the officer re-approached Don and had a calm argument with him. Following that, Don and the officer entered the bus and the officer announced he wanted 13 people off the bus. When asked who those people are, the officer began to chuckle and stated ""The Occupy Wall Street people."" He and Don began to walk down the aisle and Don asked every passenger ""are you with Occupy?"" To the 13 of us who responded yes, the police ordered them to exit the bus. Then Don said ""Anyone else support Occupy? You can get off too!"" Now we're in Amarillo at the Greyhound station. Please call Greyhound and demand we be given a charter DIRECTLY to DC. Also, a few random acts of pizza would be nice:)

UPDATE: We now have our current tickets for our re-boarding. However, greyhound has refused to refund any money or compensate us in any way. We have also been warned concerning the next driver, so we'll see how that goes. About 20 minutes until we board.


UPDATE: We have just left the incredible city of Nashville, TN. Next stop is Knoxville. According to Greyhound, we will be going straight to DC and arriving at 3pm. Not a single stop after Knoxville. The issue I personally see is that it's around eight hours from Knoxville to DC. If we arrive in Knoxville at 1am, we would have to leave at 8am to be arriving in DC at 3pm with no stops. SO PLEASE STAY TUNED, as it appears we may be facing some... underwhelming accomodations.

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the nation has been led astray by the greed of corporations and of self-serving politicians. We are awakening to the reality that certain corporate entities and certain politicians have conspired to usurp control of this nation from the People. The People have been deceived, but we cannot allow the borderline treasonous actions of a handful of very powerful individuals to corrupt the ideals upon which this nation was founded.


Our politicians have revealed themselves to be incapable of performing their duty in the interests of the People; therefore, it is the duty of the People to take action, in order to protect those ideals for which our forefathers risked their lives. We have arrived at a critical point in our nation's history, and we must each ask ourselves whether we want the illusion of freedom or the real thing. 


If we desire true freedom, we must act quickly, but we must first understand the strategic position at which we now find ourselves. Obviously, we have aligned ourselves against the interests of corporations, which means we have also aligned ourselves against the majority of politicians. We have no political recourse in the current environment for two reasons:

 
* The Occupy movement is not a culturally, economically or politically cohesive group of voters, which means politicians have no need to integrate the demands of the Occupy movement into their campaigns. The 99% is a demographic scattershot of Americans. Therefore, neither Republican nor Democratic politicians will lose an election due to their refusal to acknowledge the issue.

* Politicians understand that campaigning is impossible without corporate funding. They will not sacrifice their career goals for the demands of the people.


We understand these things, which is why the movement has supported a Constitutional Convention. However, we cannot rely solely on this outcome, nor should we be so naive as to believe such an outcome would solve the problems facing our nation, to do so would be a tremendous waste of the movement's momentum and the possibilities that it has created for us. 


We currently have the means and resources to launch a campaign to create a new political party that more accurately represents the desires of voters. [I recently outlined what such a party could look like in 'A Sincere Proposal'](http://anoncentral.tumblr.com/post/11395867006/a-sincere-proposal). We must remember that if we fail in our efforts to force a Constitutional Convention, and we do not have a 'Plan B', we may not be able to recapture the momentum the movement currently has.


The Occupation movement is not about the redistribution of wealth, as some fear-mongering media outlets would have us believe; it is not solely about the demands which we have made; it is about a permanent redistribution of power from corporations and government back to the people. This is what we are really demanding. As long as our political system does not allow for a viable third party, our politicians will continue to act in their own interests.",,False,self,t5_2sn7r,False,,,True,t3_lw761,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/lw761/the_occupation_movement_is_not_about/,

[The Atlantic Wire Updates](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/judge-temporarily-reopens-zuccotti-park/44992/)

The court hearing is going on right now. No word yet from the courthouse. 

[Copy of court order](http://nlgnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Order-re-Liberty-Park.pdf)

The police has to present evidence as to why they evicted the protesters from Zuccotti park and then a decision will be made and the temporary court order will end. Police have waited it out and not allowed the protesters in ZP. The injunction ended at 11:30am. Everyone is waiting to here the out come of the court hearing.

During his 8 a.m. press conference, Mayor Bloomberg seemed to acknowledge he was familiar with the temporary restraining order, but claimed he had not been served and was keeping the park closed.

Protesters are reading the court order out loud in unison to the police. The police are still blockading them from entering the park. 

EDIT: Police took a flag (what kind?) from protesters and put it behind their lines inside the park.

EDIT 11:35am: Police have been given the court order by some sort of Lawyer's Guild (National Lawyer's Guild?), but continue to hold out silently. TheOther99 is questioning officers as to why they are disobeying the judge, but they are not responding. TheOther99 is reading their names and badge numbers out loud. Most officers are being completely stoic while others are smirking.

EDIT 11:58am: The crowd is pretty calm now. Everyone is waiting to hear news from the courtroom.

EDIT 12:00pm: A protester decided to break from the crowd and jumped over the barricade, ran into the park carrying an American flag in an attempt to plant it in the park. Crowd started cheering, police immediately converged on him and carried him off in zip ties. Crowd has found some spirit again. Chanting ""Shame, Shame"" and cheering for the flag runner.

EDIT 12:13pm: Police might be taking down barricades at the moment. Not confirmed.

EDIT 12:20pm: Speculative word is circling that court hearing is over. Pretty sure police are NOT taking down barricades.

EDIT 12:23pm: An officer just said that he had not received a court order - although another cop earlier said he had. However, this same officer just said that the court order has been appealed.

EDIT 12:28pm: If you're a fan of [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLud2Op7eAc&amp;feature=related) (Jesse LaGreca), he was just making a little speech again. Nothing seems to be happening at the moment.

EDIT 12:38pm: Still no word about the court hearing. Unrelated news: Protesters were taking refuge at the Trinity church parking lot. Around 10:00am I heard them saying the church said they were welcome. However, just moments the church said they were unwelcome and police are mobilizing to remove them if necessary. [News report saying the protesters cut locks](http://www.wtam.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=104668&amp;article=9398396)

EDIT 12:49pm: The original judge assigned to the hearing has been removed by the city of NY (how?why?), which explains the delay somewhat. &lt;No evidence other than hearsay&gt; A new judge must already be assigned because there is a court hearing going on. Speculation that this is a delay tactic by the 1%. Supposedly the new judge was assigned by lottery.

EDIT 1:05pm: There is rumors that Oakland is in a ""full-blown riot... breaking bank windows"" No confirmation yet. Probably just an exaggerated rumor.

EDIT 1:15pm: There is a report coming to the police on the ground. Rumor is decision has been made, that protesters are good to stay. Additonal rumors that global revolution is broadcasting a march that is composed of 500 strong headed towards Z park to join the people already there.

EDIT 1:17pm: People can ""hear the march coming."" Much cheering and excitement... and drums.

EDIT 1:23pm: The [globalrevolution stream](http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution) is now also at ZP, after following the marchers.

EDIT 1:30pm: [LIVE TWITTER FROM COURTROOM}](http://twitter.com/#!/alicitabrennan). Kind of deserves its own thread/update. Very interesting. Protestors chanting ""Open the park""

EDIT 1:41pm: The OWS crowd has grown extremely dense since the arrival of the marchers. More and more people are converging on ZP. Rumors Oakland being full riot seem to be certainly false.

EDIT 1:48pm: In the courtroom, OWS attorney seem to be making it a freedom of speech argument and pointing out that the park is healthy and taken care of. City says that OWS doesn't need ""tents"" to make their message heard, so removing them isn't unconstitutional; also, they say the park is dirty and w/ unhealthy conditions.

EDIT 1:52pm: [New judge is Michael Stallman](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/judge-temporarily-reopens-zuccotti-park/44992/)

EDIT 1:56pm: Judge Stillman says there will be no extension until he makes final decision at 3:00pm (one hour)

EDIT 2:09pm: Everyone is simply waiting in suspense. No one can go into park. Police have been barricading all day and a throng of additional police showed up when the crowd exploded with marchers from  coming to join in. The marchers came from Duarte Square after being kicked out of Trinity Church, where the police have [totally cleared out the parking lot.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/judge-temporarily-reopens-zuccotti-park/44992/)

There is a pretty good amount of energy going on, considering that most of these OWS'ers were up all night being evicted and watching their belonging taken or destroyed. The judge is suppose to give his decision at 3:00pm, so we still have 49 minutes.

Alright ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately, I must go buy my mother a birthday card and go to work. I've left some useful links at the top so everyone can try to stay updated. Someone should take over so the people who are at work can read the updates.

She and many other people told me that all the violence and law breaking had happened much much earlier in the day.
The only reason the occupiers entered the YMCA was to get away from the police. 
The mainstream media has essentially launched a propaganda campaign.
Nearly all of the 400 (yes im hearing 400 now) that were arrested were peaceful.
I know my sister was for a fact.
My family has contacted the county jail and opd jail and they say she was never arrested.
After contacting the NLG we were told that they are screwing up the processing consistently. 
She has not been able to make a phone call and we have not been able to confirm where she is.
Its been 16 hours.

Edit:
she just called from santa rita county jail
what sucks is she called my moms cell phone which she could not answer from and now santa rita still claims they have no record of her, even though she is obviously processed.

Edit 2:
after 25 hours she has been booked and we
received this message through proxy from her

1318724670.0,615,self.occupywallstreet,ldmo9,I just closed out my Chase account and have some advice for November 5 I wanted to share.,675,60,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/ldmo9/i_just_closed_out_my_chase_account_and_have_some/,"I know most of you plan to move your bank accounts on or before November 5 and I just wanted to share the experience my wife and I went thorough today. I expect you'll likely have the same experience. 

My wife had a BofA account from when she was in college. We went in to our local branch to close out her account. 

First off, they are already feeling the squeeze of people leaving. The rep asked us if we were leaving because of the fees. My wife said she was for that reason. The rep then decided to try and educate us on the fees. Don't listen to them. My wife stood to her guns that she wanted to just join a local credit union to support our local economy, etc..  That ended the rep's attempt to keep my wife a customer. 

My wife had her account closed and she pulled out all her money. Total time, about 20 minutes at most. 

My experience was a bit different as I was with Chase, and had a lot more money in my account. 

I walked into my local branch and spoke with the branch manager about closing my account. So she helped me. 

Once we say in her cubicle, she asked me why I was leaving. I told her I wanted to move to a local bank and help with our community by investing in it by being a customer. I could tell this conversation was going to be difficult. 

It literally took me 30 minutes to close my account. But the branch manager was freaked out because of me closing my account, she was worried her district manager would ask why I was closing my account. I then told her this, ""look this isn't anything against you or any of your tellers in this branch. I'm just not comfortable having my life savings wrapped up with Chase. I've read plenty of news articles about shady practices Chase has been in. I'm worried that Chase invests money in other states with bad loans. I'm not comfortable letting a for profit company take everything I saved and make bad choices. I dont want to contribute to the cause. I want to take my money, put it in my local credit union, and help them give borrowing capability to my community.""

She looked like she was about to cry. I didn't say it in a dick tone mind you. I just felt that she would have to answer to her boss why someone pulled their entire savings out in one day, she had to know the truth. 

At any rate, my wife and I opened our new credit union accounts and we're happy. I'm in my 30s and I remember as a kid, banks used to have a personal feel to them and our credit union has that. Everyone smiling, chocolate candy dish at the front desk, it just feels good. 

So the point of this rant is I wanted to just give everyone a heads up about these things:

- remember, the teller, manager, branch manager are not the enemy. They're part of 99% too and they need to earn a living. Please don't take your frustration of fees and other problems out on them. I almost did until I stopped myself. 

- when asked about why you're leaving, be honest. Not happy with the $5 fee? Let them know. Not happy they foreclosed on homes of friends? Let them know. As we draw out our funds, the district managers will know something is up and ask their branch managers. If the branch managers have our feedback to give, it could really affect changes in the future. 

- stick to your guns. If they dangle a free toaster in front of you, ignore it. It'll make things easier if you pick out a bank ahead of time. It took us ten minutes to find the one we liked. We compared the two banks and decided the CU was way better and was worth an hour or two of our time. If you have an idea of how much better a new bank is, it'll be easier to get rid of the old one. 

- don't feel guilty for leaving your bank. I did for a bit, but kept reminding myself that our CU was going to make life easier.

If you feel compelled to tell the CEO of your old bank after you leave, do it. You might feel better. Just don't write any nasty things. Be honest and tell them you left because of this list of reasons. Sorry I you couldn't stay with them, but you found a better bank because they don't have these list of reasons after bank. 

Here is a list of the big four banks I could think of. These are the email addresses of the CEOs:

Chase - jamie.dimon@jpmchase.com

BofA - brian.t.moynihan@bankofamerica.com

Wells Fargo - John.G.Stumpf@wellsfargo.com

Citibank - Vikram.Pandit@citi.com

1328466382.0,550,self.occupywallstreet,pc1tw,"I just had an idea for how Occupy could get its 
message out to the entire 99% and there would be 
no way the 1% could or would want to stop us: 
Occupy Banknotes",749,199,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/pc1tw/i_just_had_an_idea_for_how_occupy_could_get_its/,"[I'm thinking something along the lines of this](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1678641/1-bills-defaced-with-occupy-wall-street-charts), but *en masse*, and with all denominations; Here's the gist of it:

Occupy is taking in a lot of money in cash donations, and these cash donations are being used to purchase supplies at local businesses in the surrounding area, and the People who work at those businesses are on the sidelines of Occupy; those who aren't yet able to join for whatever reason or don't want to because they're so deep in the media haze that they can't see past it. They might not want to hear what we have to say if we talk to them directly; But, there is one thing that they are very likely not to get rid of or refuse to take: Our Money.

The whole capitalist system runs on money; on cold, hard, cash. Yes, plastic has changed the world, but banknotes aren't going anywhere anytime soon and they're used by almost every part of the 99% (and yes, I saw the post about the person not being able to pay for their mortgage with cash; this is dealing with the 99% as a whole, not with what the Banks want).

We need to be piggybacking our message on the one means of control that the 1% needs to maintain its power: Money. 

**Every Occupy chapter needs to recruit a team of people with nice handwriting to sit down with the donation money they've collected and write facts about income inequality and other pro-Occupy information on all the bills being used by their chapter, that way when the bills end up in circulation they spread to every corner of the local municipality, thus advertising for Occupy and spreading real facts throughout the general populace. Individual Occupiers should do this to every bill they use, as well. Remember, [There is no law on the books in the US against defacing banknotes; this is perfectly legal](http://www.ehow.com/list_6535889_defacing-u_s_-currency-laws.html).**

The best part of this? If the facts get written on $20s or $50s, almost no-one is (realistically) going to destroy the bill, since the 99% are fairly hard up for money and whom do you know who would be benefitted by Occupy that would be willing to trash a $50 just because it had a political message that they disagree with written on it? Nobody; they're going to spend it instead, thus keeping the bill in circulation. The only other option is to take it to the bank and ask that it be exchanged, and in that case the cashiers and front-line 99%ers who work there are going to be inundated with requests to have this money changed out to fresh bills, and in the process the front-line people at the banks are going to read a *ton* of pro-OWS facts.

This is a way to cut right through the media bias and reach people in their day-to-day lives away from the protests. If Occupy is going to become a larger social movement, this isn't a bad way to do it, I think.

**TL;DR: Write pro-OWS facts and information on all your banknotes and on all the bills that your local Occupy chapter has collected in the form of donations and then get those bills cirulating in the local community. (e.g., facts on income inequality, quotes about democracy, URLs for pro-OWS websites, facts about Media Bias and corporate control of Media; whatever you can think of that will wake people up)**

Let us use the weapon of the Enemy against Them.

*Edit: grammar*

*Edit 2: I'll put an actual link to the [Occupy George](http://occupygeorge.com/) campaign, which really is the impetus of this idea; I'm only suggesting that we ramp up production. The site also has a pretty good map of Occupy Events in the US &amp; Canada.*

*Edit 3: Another idea - Maybe we should start calling this new kind of currency ""Occupy Dollars"" and start trying to get sympathetic stores to only accept ""Occupy Dollars"" once there are enough in circulation. Since merchants are allowed to refuse any transaction they want, and ""Occupy Dollars"" are just defaced US currency that's still legal tender, we can create a kind of ""Counter-Monetary system"" that symbolically states our resistance to their control. As in, ""Yes, we have to use the money issued by the Federal Reserve, but it's still the PEOPLE's money, we are a Free People, and we have a right to change the way it looks in any way we want"". Money is a powerful symbolic tool when it comes to defining a people and a community. Every nation puts the things that are most important to it on their money. If we're going to make Occupy a real social movement with long-term viability, maybe we should start enshrining our own Occupy facts on the money; it hangs around a lot longer than most stuff; I still find Wheat pennies and Bicentennial quarters sometimes, and I still have a $2 bill. I think all Occupiers should start using Occupy Money. This is a viable long-term thing if we can keep it going that might really let us leave our mark on the public consciousness.*",,False,self,t5_2sn7r,True,,,True,t3_pc1tw,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/pc1tw/i_just_had_an_idea_for_how_occupy_could_get_its/,

I'd like to start, briefly, by thanking the staff at Highland hospital in Oakland, CA, for the help they have given Cpl. Scott Olsen. From what I hear, his condition is continuously (albeit slowly) improving, and we owe them our full gratitude for the work they have done, and continue to do. To Cpl. Olsen's family, I offer my sincerest apology on behalf of anybody that has yet to apologize. What happened should not have occurred, and I am deeply sorry for what you are currently going through. Know that he, undoubtedly, has great determination, and I hope to see that realized further as his condition continues to improve.
  
  
Now is not the time for further anger or violence. Now is the time to hurl logical thought, with rational minds, and calm demeanors. Yes, a lot of us are angry, but that anger can be directed in very productive ways. There is no changing what has already occurred, be it in Oakland, New York, or any other city across the globe. Instead, we move on, more rational than ever. The police, as a whole, should not be blamed for what has, unfortunately, already occurred. The individuals responsible, and their chain(s) of command, need to be held accountable -- not the organization(s), themselves. If the anger that we all feel is directed at the police, in general, then it is misguided. 
  
  
We need to police our own. We need to be better men and women than those whom we think currently oppose us. If fire is fought with more fire, then you end up with nothing shy of an inferno. Stones and insults hurled from your side of the line need to be cut down before they reach the other. If we are self-policed, then the need for police *officers* to do it is lessened. They will be thankful, have room to breathe, and time to think about things for themselves with clear heads, much as you all started doing long ago. Have patience and let them have the clarity required to see how any actions they are taking may be hurting you. They are human beings and, whether they display them or not, have feelings that just may include not wanting to see their fellow human beings suffer.
  
  
I have seen a lot of quoting of John F. Kennedy lately. Specifically, ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" I urge you to be better than this quote and, I assure you, peaceful ""revolution"" is not impossible. Stand your ground, and stand it firmly, but do not turn to violence. For every violent act, hurled object, insult, or generalization that is lobbed in one direction or the other, another brick is stacked on the wall that currently separates us. Cool heads, collected thoughts, and rational minds can tear down this wall. The American police, during this time, are our Egyptian military, during their recent revolution, and we need those uniformed men and women on our side. 
  
  
With insults currently flying around, I want to discourage our use of them. Please try to refrain from unintended and inconsiderate soundbytes full of foulness. Foul language paints a bad picture and, for the most part, isn't usable in most broadcasts. I know for a fact that we are all better than this. Do not be reactionary; we are in this for a much bigger picture than immediate reactions and overgeneralizations. Take a few seconds to collect your thoughts, and find a proper response before giving it. We must provide the artists in the media with no option other than painting us as a logical, rational group. Do not give them the ammunition, for which, they beg.
  
  
As children, we are told that we can be anything we want to be. If we work hard, our wildest dreams can become realities. If anybody tells you otherwise, let them, but keep this in the backs of your minds. I want to be a man that encourages change and reform, and encourages it happening with no further injuries. If you want to turn your dreams into realities, you have the power to do so.
  
  
Dialog and debate are two very different things. Encourage dialog, especially with people that disagree with you. If you don't let them tell you their side of the story, you can't expect them to be willing to listen to yours. Know that they are not against you just because their opinion differs from yours. Hear them out and, respectfully, ask that they hear you out. Have a fair and peaceful exchange, not a battle. To quote a man much wiser than myself, ""Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress. When you're pissed off at someone and you're angry at them, you just haven't given them enough time. Just give them a little more time and they almost always will impress you.""
  
  
In the end, he or she who speaks loudest does not always win. It will the voices that resonate the most, and the longest, that prevail. I implore you, be part of that voice. Let your message echo for eternity. Be the better people.
  
  
Semper Fidelis

As an aside, I have recently been speaking with people at Occupy Trenton. They are in need of cold weather gear, including gloves. If you're unable to donate your time, please consider reaching out and donating gear to your local Occupy protesters, especially with the fast-approaching unfavorable weather. If you don't agree with what they're protesting, that's fine -- but it doesn't mean they should suffer. Thank you very much.

""Tools of violence"" would include helmets, shields or any ""Impact resistant material with straps"" which could mean backpacks, and ""Clubs"" which could be defined as tripods, or water bottles. This ordinance would give officers probable cause to search and arrest anyone found carrying these items at a ""Demonstration."" What a demonstration is, is not defined at all in the ordinance, so a demonstration could consist of any event any officer subjectively decides is a demonstration. 

Please come to the special public safety committee meeting tomorrow (5/22/12) at 6 pm, Oakland city hall to air your grievances.

They want to ban anything made of wood, plastic, or metal, of any length, if it is bigger than ¼” x 2” in diameter, or if cylindrical bigger than ¾."" That’s how the ordinance defines a “club.”

This would ban just about anything – cameras, ice chests, water bottles, etc. Even if it is amended to specify a minimum length, so it actually identifies potential clubs, the dimensions are so small that it would ban tripods and monopods, boom stands for microphones, and a lot of sign posts.

Worse, it would give the police probable cause to arrest anyone carrying anything which might be bigger than those dimensions.


There is plenty of legal justification against this law. First of all, it isn't enforceable. A law that is not enforceable creates a situation of selective enforcement by default. There is no possible way to arrest every person carrying a ""Club"" as defined by this law, they will only arrest those that they feel like arresting, creating a situation of political repression.

Second about shields, and other personal protective gear. It is completely reasonable to assume that you will be injured at a protest if you are in the vicinity of the OPD, regardless of if you are within the law. This is well documented trend. The OPD regularly violate their own crowd control policies, and seriously injure protestors. Therefore, it is reasonable for any person to take measures to protect their person from needless injury. 

Click on the link that says ""View report"" to read the text of the ordinance.

UPDATE: We are calling for a protest for tonight if this ordinance against ""Tools of violence"" passes. Tweeters and social organizers, please get the word out. I feel like it is a necessity to show our discontent, our ungovernableness, and complete opposition to this law immediately.

Also this means that anyone, at any job, can start a union to improve their working conditions, if they're willing to go through the legal hoops.

I wasn't working there for all that long, and only a couple shifts per week, but for the people that've worked there full time for years... I don't want money, but this is bullshit. My coworkers deserve better than this shit, we don't even get shift meals.

The goals of OWS will not be accomplished while the same two parties are in control of everything.

What can you do about it? Get voter initiatives and referendums on the ballot in 2012. Vote for people who support electoral reform. Support third party candidates. Spread the word. Make this such a huge issue that our current elected officials can't ignore it. It should be political suicide to oppose electoral reform.

Specifically, how do we reform the system?

1\. **Change our system of voting.** 

Right now, in the US we use a system called ""first past the post."" Everyone gets one vote, you vote for one person, and the person with the most votes wins. Fair, right? No. First past the post (FPTP) is mathematically and historically proven to produce two party systems. The reason for this is with FPTP, instead of voting for the candidate you support the most, you tend to vote for the candidate who has the best chance of beating the candidate you hate. 

That's not real democracy. Everyone should be able to vote for whoever they support, without ""spoiling"" the election, and those votes should actually matter. **The purpose of an election is to gauge public opinion to determine how the electorate can best be represented in the government. FPTP doesn't do that.**

So, what other systems are there?

[Range Voting.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting) You rate the candidates. The candidate with the highest rating wins.

[Instant Runoff Voting.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) You rank the candidates, and preferences are taken into account in determining the winner.

[Proportional Representation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Elections have multiple winners, with seats allocated to parties proportionally to the vote totals. 

There are many more. [Please educate yourself.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system)

2\. **End [gerrymandering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY).**

Our elected officials should not be determining the circumstances of the elections that keep them in power. That is absolutely absurd.

So how do we end gerrymandering? We make [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUS9uvYyn3A) the law.

3\. **Greater [ballot access.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access)**

4\. **Get the money out of politics.** How do we do that? It's gonna be hard. The first thing we can do is get rid of [Super PACs.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/beware-the-super-pac/2011/08/31/gIQAdGB5wJ_story.html) Publicly-funded campaigns could also help. Etc. Support groups that aim to get the money out of politics. An election shouldn't be a contest to see who has the most billionaire friends, or who can cater the most to corporate interests.

Let's say you're a young kid, and your parents are divorced. You live with your dad, and he violently beats you. To escape this, you move in with your mother, who also starts beating you. To escape this, you move in with your dad, who beats you. Doesn't make sense, does it? That's what the two party system is. That's what we keep doing to ourselves. We can't afford to leave our country's future in the hands of these same people anymore. They need to be held accountable, and we need to be properly represented. The only way we can do that is by destroying the two party system. 

Now stop just complaining about it, and DO something!

I'd recommend [this guy's videos](http://www.youtube.com/cgpgrey) if you want to learn more about elections. Thanks.

So much of the current ideology is one of the people, and the people's representatives, serving the interests of capital.

The right to maximize profit is not enshrined in our founding documents, though it is something that is endlessly repeated and enforced by the centers of power. This is a struggle that has gone on for centuries, a struggle that human beings not be exploited by business or corporations. This is a moral issue. That point of the statements by Bill Clinton, and others demanding that OWS simplify their message, is so that they can neutralize the questions of morality of the current form of American capitalism and governance. 

The occupations have been expressions of moral outrage at the existing system. That is why they have been effective. Why should the 1% have so much wealth and essentially control the levers of power, as this is a perversion of the promise of the Constitution, and the promise of democracy. Corruption is a moral problem as it is any other type of problem. 

Right now, we are seeing financiers undermining the sovereign democracies of European nations, stopping referendums and installing unelected ""leaders"" and ""technocrats"" to force austerity measures down the throats of the people (Greece, Italy).  The use the instruments of capital, the bond markets, as well as many forms of shadow investment (gambling), to force the change they want. Should markets be able to do this to any democracy, including the US's?

And this is a problem on every level of government in the US. City councils, state legislatures and Congress continually serve the interests of business while continually imposing hurdles (also not listening) for the interests of citizens.

Scott Olsen's health is improving every day

Thanks so much for supporting Scott Olsen. You and thousands of others sent over 2500 emails to the Mayor of Oakland and donated an un-precedented $28,000 to our special fund for Scott!

As of last night, Scott's health is much improved, and doctors have upgraded his medical condition from critical to fair. Scott is surrounded by his family, is cognizant, and is breathing on his own without a respirator. He is still not able to speak based on the fact that the injury and swelling he's experiencing is located in the area of his brain that controls speech.  But he is able to write notes to communicate and has started working with a speech therapist.

Scott is improving daily, but despite this wonderful progress, we must remember that Scott has experienced a very serious traumatic brain injury, something that thousands of service members have suffered from IED blasts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Information about his long-term prognosis is not currently available, but we know that he has a very long road to full recovery ahead of him. The support you have shown Scott will make a huge difference in his ability to heal from this terrible tragedy.
Iraq Veterans Against the War is part of the 99% - Veterans to march in NYC

Like Scott Olsen, hundreds, perhaps thousands of veterans -- including IVAW members -- have been participating in the Occupy Movement. Like many who consider themselves among the 99%, veterans face uncertain economic futures including few job prospects and rising tuition costs. In addition, many veterans return home and have to fight for their right to heal from war wounds from an under-funded VA system. Veterans know that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have drained resources from the 99% over the past 10 years. In fact, a recent Pew poll shows that only 34% of post-911 veterans think that either war has been worth the cost or sacrifice.*

That is why this Wednesday at 11:00 AM, members of Iraq Veterans Against the War will march from Vietnam Veterans Plaza to Zucotti Park in New York City - the heart of the Occupy Wall Street movement - and hold a press conference explaining why veterans support the 99% and calling on other veterans and service members to join the Occupy movement in their local communities.

If you are a veteran who wants to join in this action, contact:

Veterans' Day Call to Action - Support Veterans' right to heal with a special focus on issues for Women Vets

This Veterans' Day, November 11, IVAW's Operation Recovery Campaign is focusing on the sacrifices and needs of women service members and veterans.

When it comes to the traumas of military service, the experience of women service members is compounded by the rampant sexism of the military. 1 in 3 women reports Military Sexual Trauma from sexual assault and/or harassment. Because of this, women have an increased likelihood of experiencing Post Traumatic Stress. There is often little support for women service members who are parents. Moreover, women are subjected to gender discrimination and are scrutinized above and beyond their male counterparts.

Sign up here (http://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=9yS9l9A9DVl2GHctZ7%2Bu9YoEiAyqyynG) to participate in IVAW's postcard campaign to General Campbell, the commander of Fort Hood.

At Fort Hood, Texas, where the Operation Recovery Campaign's organizing team has been focusing our efforts, it has been reported that there is only 1 counselor who specializes in Military Sexual Trauma on a base of over 50,000 soldiers and their families. There are very few daycare options for soldiers who are single mothers; one woman soldier told us that she was ordered to bring her toddler to work with her when she had trouble finding child care.

This Veterans' Day, we are calling on Fort Hood's commander, General Campbell, to support women's and all soldiers' right to heal. We are calling on the general to:

1) Improve access to trauma care at Fort Hood; and

2) Hold a public town hall meeting to address issues of untreated trauma at Fort Hood.

Help us send the General with this message. Sign up here, and IVAW will send a postcard to General Campbell on your behalf or send you postcards to distribute to your friends.

Thank you for taking action,

I've slept elsewhere three times since the beginning, the other time was spent occupying.

As everyone knows, we were stormed a few short days ago and many of us were arrested. I was the second person arrested. I had my head slammed into the concrete and zip-ties so tight they cut off the circulation to my thumb for four hours, killing the nerves from the joint to the tip of the finger. I was not read my rights and I was threatened with pepper spray as I called to everyone not to resist. The same threat was levied when I asked why I was being arrested. ""If you don't shut your mouth I will pepper spray you in the f***ing face."" I watched my brothers and sisters being beaten by the police from the back of a van for close to two hours. I watched an 18 year old girl have her face smashed against the ticket window at the Civic Center for sobbing and asking ""Why are you doing this?"" I listened to my sister scream for a female officer as three male officers held her down and searched her. My brothers and I spent the next 9 hours on a bus being denied of food, water, or access to a bathroom. We eventually had to designate a spot for urination on the bus after hours of begging officers of the San Diego Sheriff's department for human compassion. Although most of us had been released by 7PM that night, there was over 1000 people at the Civic Center as I arrived following my release.

All who were there witnessed the terrorist-like tactics of the police as they sent a squad of riot cops to barricade and intimidate women, children, and veterans. People began to leave immediately. They felt unsafe due to the aggressive presence of those who are supposed to protect us. They have since detained an active-duty military member for spitting in the bushes and arrested a young man for walking into an active crosswalk with his sign and standing there. They tackled him to the ground and dragged him off the road before the ""stop"" countdown had even begun. He broke no laws.

These exact occurrences are the reason for dwindling numbers at the Civic Center. The city is using fear as a tool of oppression. We are allowing them to. We need to show them we will not be silenced. Jim Morrison said ""They got the guns, but we got the numbers, we're gonna win, yeah we're taking over."" With that being said, I implore you.

1318553690.0,425,self.occupywallstreet,lbhro,How to Handle Tear-Gas and OC Spray: From an Army Medic,467,42,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/lbhro/how_to_handle_teargas_and_oc_spray_from_an_army/,"Hey guys, 

I wanted to offer some support and advice if the police become aggressive, especially if they use tear-gas and oc sprays (pepper spray).

One of the most important things to know about these two are that they're non-lethal, except for a very minute portion of people. Those being the elderly, sick or very young - they shouldn't be apart of the protests when things get hairy. If you're out of shape, a young kid (what are you doing there anyway), or elderly - please let the young people handle the beating.  Losing lives among our most vulnerable is counter productive.

Even if you're standing in a cloud of Tear Gas or OC Sprays, and your lungs are coming out of chest, you can't see, and you feel like you can't breathe - you still can. The very concept of non-lethal is to exact pain to make you move and comply. You will feel like absolute SHIT!! BUT YOU CAN SURVIVE IT.

**Effects:**

Tear Gas: An over production of mucus and severe pain the chest. Severe coughing. I highly recommend you wear glasses when they do this, because tear gas *CAN CAUSE CONTACTS TO FUSE TO YOUR EYES AND MAY PERMANENTLY DAMAGE THEM.*

OC Spray: The burning piss of Satan across everything you know

Your first reaction will be to run away. Exactly what the cops want. I DEMAND that you don't! Rather, link arms with your friends and take the beating. Don't fight back or get aggressive. This whole image will bolster your legitimacy. It reflects your strength and solidarity.

Further, cops would ABSOLUTELY HATE to handle you if you have OC Spray or Tear Gas on you. That shit rubs off on them and they'll even get a bit of pain themselves from it. If you stick it out once, they will become reluctant to use it again because they'll know they'll have to carry you out.

**How to treat those things:**

Tear gas: You will have to wait it out in fresh air. AGAIN THOSE WITH CONTACTS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO NOT WEAR THEM - get your glasses! It will be a bad day for your vision for the rest of your life. Also, avoid everything you can do to rub your eyes because the crystals may damage your eyes.

OC Spray: Fresh running water and baby soap. This will relieve the pain by a significant amount. The logistics may be difficult, but I would recommend 'OC Spray Teams' of people with gallons and gallons of water and baby soap washing peoples eyes and faces out.

Remember, your legitimacy derives from being peaceful. There are plenty of cops out there who empathize with you; don't make enemies of them. They are not and were never your enemies. They are only the buffer for what's considered peace. Your opponent is the Corporations who steal money from everyday citizens. 

---

**Anecdotes:**

In Basic Training, we were subjected to Tear Gas chambers where we had to stay in an enclosed environment for something like 2 minutes breathing that wonderful stuff in. It was not pleasant, but stands to testify that you can live through it.

Also, I worked in a detainment camp where we used it during Riots, and that stuff out in the open is a whole lot more potent. Again, still survivable.

As far as OC Spray goes, the main thing is to channel the pain. During non-lethal training, I saw large and tall soldiers come down like babies. I've also seen little women take it in stride. Its all mental.

Having said its all mental, make it mental with your friends and fellow protesters. Link arms and show solidarity!",,False,self,t5_2sn7r,True,,,True,t3_lbhro,http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/lbhro/how_to_handle_teargas_and_oc_spray_from_an_army/,

It's about time we start fighting the police in a different way. Allow me to suggest the ultimate in passive resistance:

Do not cooporate with the police. 

This means do not speak, and do not move. Let your body go completely limp, so that those motherfucking pigs are forced to move literally thousands and thousands of pounds of protesters by themselves.
This tactic has worked in the past to pressure police departments into taking a more peaceful role, since there's absolutely no way not to look like an evil pig if you're spraying or bashing a limp protester.
And don't forget... film everything and upload immediately.


**POINTS TO REMEMBER**

1. 100% passive resistance, meaning physical AND mental (see above) is no guarantee that you won't get the shit kicked out of you or maced in the face by a cop.  The idea is that if you're being beaten, do *nothing* to stop it.  Of course, protect your face and soft parts if you can, but other than that do NOT stand up, do NOT roll over, do NOT move of your own volition.  This will paint a very clear and TRUE picture of the police-- they are NOT our friends, they are NOT here to protect us, they are NOT trying to make anyone's life easier by nicely offering you a chance to stand up.

2. This technique of complete passive resistance makes it very difficult for the police to clear a protest area of protesters.  What may have taken 15-30 minutes will take all night, giving everyone lots of photo and video opportunity, and a much larger time window to contact other protesters around your area to get them to show up and be more dead weight to move.

3. Again, it makes the police look very bad when they get violent.  **And again, this is not to say that this method will protect you from police violence-- it WONT**, but what it does do is give the police and their supporters a much thinner leg to stand on legally, politically, and ethically. 

4. Remember what we're doing, and what we're trying to change, and why.  Let it get into your head all the way when you're lying there, limp, waiting to be thrown into the back of a pig wagon.  You're doing something not only of tremendous importance, but you're also doing it *absolutely* nonviolently, and *absolutely* non-confrontationally.  

I've seen a limp-out first hand, and let me tell you… there's no silence in this universe quite like that silence.  It can move a mountain.

It happened in the civil rights movement, in the women's struggle, in the gay liberation movements, and even most recently in Wisconsin. Unions are only *potentially* progressive institutions, very often they channel the energy of movements with huge potential into their own fight for short-term reformist goals, which ends in the disillusionment of many in the movement. I don't want to speak for everyone, but I think we need to make it clear that we want more fundamental change, not simply the re-election of Barack Obama, nor even a Democratic landslide in the next election. We need to build *independent* political institutions, parties, forums, and all the rest with the intention of *leading* the unions in the struggle. It doesn't matter whether you're liberal, anarchist, Marxist, or whatever; what's absolutely necessary right now is that we build *political* organizations that can maintain the level of energy we've achieved thus far, while pushing it forward at the same time in a more *revolutionary* direction.

1) Remain peaceful as best you can. Any mainstream media covering the event WILL record every act of violence however small and play it a thousand times over as evidence that this movement is dangerous and scary. 

2) RECORD, RECORD, RECORD.  Bring your camcorders. Bring your camera phones. Bring your cameras.  If you have a high-quality camera with a long lens, try to get to a high place where you can see.  

We *need* HIGH-QUALITY, UNEQUIVOCAL video of the actions undertaken by the protesters and the police, positive and negative. We *need* to take that video and send it to our friends and family, and to every local and national media outlet we can. 

People need to know what it is really like out here.  

Good luck, and be safe.  If I can, I will be out there with you.

- Do you think it's reasonable that the top 1% of Americans control 40% of the wealth while the bottom 40% (that's about 125 million people) of Americans control less than 2%?

- Is it fair that 90% of elections at all levels are won by the person who spends more money (or gets more money from private interests)?

- Do you support the right of corporations to spend millions of dollars lobbying congress, undermining the relationship between politicians and their constituents?

- Does it seem moral that politicians can use insider information based on policy decisions to trade stocks and line their own pockets?

- Is it okay that politicians who help corporations often end up getting high-paying jobs from those same corporations when they leave office?

- Does it seem fair that the Wall St. bigwigs who, through reckless gambling, usury and fraud collapsed the housing market and the economy with it, did not lose their ample fortunes, let alone serve jail time?

- Is it right that many of those same bigwigs actually got millions of dollars in bonuses while hard working Ameircans were having their houses forceclosed on?

- Does it seem logical that in our capitalist system, a massive financial institution could become ""too big to fail,"" forcing taxpayers to pickup a multi-trillion dollar bill brought about by destructive and reckless decision making by those institutions' leadership?

- Do you see a problem with the fact that 20 years ago, you could raise a family on a single income, while today 2-income families sometimes barely scrape by - and that trend looks to continue?

- Is it acceptable that peaceful protesters exercising civil disobedience are subjected to tear gas, pepper spray and beatings?

The real question isn't ""Why support Occupy."" It's ""How COULDN'T you?""

EDIT: Responding to the question of ""What are the solutions you're proposing?"" To boil down some other well-written arguments in this thread:

""We don't have them. These are difficult problems to solve, and it's not really our job to solve them. But our current political system and current representatives are incapable or unwilling to solve them, and so we must take up the task. If you agree that these things are problems, then lend your voice and your support and help us come up with solutions.""
