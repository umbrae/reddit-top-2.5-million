EDIT FOR OFF THE WALL AMAZEMENT!!!!!!!!!!

************Guys who ever gave the reddit Gold THANK YOU. Please no more gifts though, I am not here for the Karma.

Let me tell you what I am here for.

I am here for people like John (name changed) who messged me because he is at the end of his rope and ready to give up in life. He has been bullied and made fun of and had no one to talk to. 

If weight loss has done ONE FREAKING THING for me, it is an attitude to change the world. Please feel free to message me if you are struggling. It is my honor and a privilege to help/encourage people in the shoes I have walked in.*********

Since some mod (epaka, maybe?) decided to delete my other post quoting epaka on the keto IRC chat, I'll put the quote here: 

&gt; I want to ban every one of these stupid fucks. It's just post after post, message after message about how I'm a tyrant and I need to resign and deliver a public apology.

deleted post: http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1686tm/i_want_to_ban_every_one_of_these_stupid_fucks_its/

***end of update***

I found r/keto browsing /r/all. Being able to see the progress pic with ease piqued my interest and brought me in. *I would likely not be here otherwise*.

We vote to bring the things we want to the top. I'm sorry you mods don't like what we like, but deal with it. *We* make this a community, not you.

I'm starting a new subreddit, /r/freeketo. There will never be any moderation or restrictions there, ever. Feel free to join.

I am unsubbing from /r/keto. If you object to this decision, you should too.

EDIT: another option is /r/theketodiet, who have done a nice job getting their ball rolling and have promised to keep their moderation very hands off.

EDIT2: I'd like to bring some attention to a portion of andr50's comment. While I don't agree with all of it (I am recommending leaving), he does have a very good idea:

&gt; If the mods are not happy about the science articles not hitting the top, they should do something similar to what /r/gaming did - keep /r/keto the catch-all, keep it the big, front-page keto sub, and spec the science to /r/ketoscience or something. Make ANOTHER place for jsut the stuff they want propagated, and keep the 50k+ subscribers who subscribed already because of what the community IS (not what they want / think it could it to be)

It's Friday and that means it is time for an update. I just want to start off by saying that finding this subreddit and using the tools and motivation here is basically saving my life.  In just over 2 full months I feel more alive than I have in many many years. Everyone here along with my friends and family have been so supportive and I am feeling better than ever.  Right before I started keto I had reached a state where any physical activity left me in extreme back pain so I had decided to solve this by simply not doing anything and missing out on things in life.  Now.. I am ripping and ready to go at all times and can do many many things without feeling pain.. I've still got a long way to go but I feel like I've come a long way so far..   

As promised here is the picture set.  Left side.. heaviest, weight unknown. Shirt size 6-8x depending and leaning toward the high side.. Pants 62.

I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes almost 15 years ago. Last week, my Dr. pulled me off of all diabetes meds because my blood sugar has normalized. I'm still big, and have a long way to go, but apparently I crossed that line where my pancreas just said, ""Thanks... I got this now bro""

This is a huge HUGE deal to me.  I've always kept my sugars fairly in check, but it was always at the back of my mind. ""I'm diabetic. I'll probably have a heart attack early. I won't be an old grandpa and see my grandkids grow up. I'll probably lose a foot or some bullshit. I hope I don't go blind.""

Being taken off of these meds has given me new drive and a new desire to keep going and change my body. This is just preliminary, and both my Dr. and I are watching my sugar levels carefully. I'm still officially diabetic, but I am hopeful that one day my Dr. can tell me I am in the clear.

For years diabetes has been this black cloud over me.  Like death looming over my thoughts of my future... teasing me saying ""Maybe you'll be fine... maybe not though... I'll be around.""

Now, who knows what my future holds?",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_1dewhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1dewhf/nsv_huge_fucking_nsv_huge_big/,

***Please upvote for visibility. This is a self post and receives no karma.***

We’ve recently been discussing the future direction of this community and have found that many of the science-based posts and other relevant discussions are buried under an endless list of progress pictures and food porn. We love all of your amazing weight loss stories and to see the results of this lifestyle change on so many different people is truly inspiring. We also believe that this community is a place to help people succeed with Keto. That being said, in order to improve the overall quality of the community, we’ve discussed and put into action the idea of making /r/keto “Self-Post/Text Post Only”. What this means is that for most posts, nothing changes. What does this change?

_________________________
**Progress Pictures:** We'd love for you to create a writeup that lets people know about your specific keto experience; where you started, how long it's taken you, struggles you've had along the way, how you've overcome them, some of your favorite recipes, tips for beginners, where you'd eventually like to end up, your plans to get there, etc. And with this write-up, post links to your progress photos.

**FoodPorn:** Same deal. We want to know how you made whatever it is you’re eating! Post a recipe or even a simple process if it’s just something you threw together in the kitchen. If it’s a really well thought out recipe or an external link, you might want to think about posting it to r/ketorecipes.

**Scale Pictures:** Please don’t. It’s really exciting to look down and see a number you haven’t seen in a long time (or have never seen) and to know that you’re making progress, but to the rest of the community... it’s simply numbers and toes on a scale. Instead, create a full blown progress post! How did you get down to 299lbs, 99kg, or 20 stone?? Take photos of yourself along the way, or even just before and afters!

_________________________

We really think this small change will result in an overall boost in quality posts on /r/keto. We want to encourage more content and detailed information along with your posts of infographics, progress pics and crazy food porn. What we hope is that this small change will improve the overall quality of the content you read in the community and give some of the more important discussions the ability to reach our front page, and thus a wider audience.

Martinus and LadySixString have been working tirelessly to get our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq) updated and ported over to the new Reddit format and we’ve got some great info in the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/about/sidebar) and [Keto In A Nutshell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZfJejOM8fJsX1iCilmnpp1qmT_KncJwWCR4-EsaEHc/edit?pli=1) that tend to answer 98% of the questions you’ll have regarding Keto. Read through everything and still have a question? Either enter a keyword in the keto search bar or create a post! There are literally thousands of people who have been exactly where you are that can answer just about any question you throw at them.

Thank you all for being a part of this amazing community! We can’t wait to see what 2013 brings!

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012


http://imgur.com/a/q9eWO


I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big &amp; Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.

Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.

Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

Most of you know I did have weight loss surgery, however I still follow a keto diet. This morning I had 1 egg and some franks red hot. KETO ON!

EDIT: r/loseit is not the enemy. For the most part they were very supportive. I did get the occasional yahoo that messaged me saying that I was hurting my body due to keto. Some people just do not understand.

So recently /r/keto has gotten a few shout outs in mainland reddit with crossposts and bestofs and such.  I wanted to make this post as a sort of general guide to keto noobs who inevitably ask the same questions.

**Can I eat (X)?**

You can do whatever the hell you want, I'm not your mom.  If you are trying to remain in ketosis then the answer is ""What does the label say?""  People with absolutely no knowledge of food contents may be surprised to see that things like brown rice, apples, milk, and beans are high in carbohydrates and incompatible with a keto lifestyle.  However, we shouldn't have to tell you that because this data is posted for free online.  If you don't know, look it up!  www.myfitnesspal.com www.nutritiondata.com www.sparkpeople.com are all great sites with great nutritional information.

**Herp Derp Coke Zero?**

what does the label say?  Diet soda won't knock you out of ketosis.  That's Broscience^TM.  It has no carbs.  What it will do, however is make you hungry and crave sweets.  I recommend tapering off artificial sweeteners as best as you can.  They're not helpful in developing healthy eating habits.

**Derpa doo calories?**

Yes, Virginia, calories do matter.  5000 calories of bacon and eggs a day (5KCOBED^TM) is not how one loses weight.  You do need to maintain a caloric deficit to lose weight, there is simply no way around that.  What Keto does is ensure that fat is the body's primary fuel source so that when you are in a caloric deficit, the body quickly burns the fat stored on your body.  Ketosis is also, largely, an inefficient process and people often find that their base metabolic rate seems to be higher on keto, allowing them to lose more weight on a higher calorie intake than they were losing on a traditional restricted calorie diet.  Get into ketosis first, make good habits to avoid carbs for 2 weeks, then do a sanity check to see if you are anywhere near a caloric deficit by tracking what you eat.  Initially you will likely lose a considerable amount of weight even on a caloric surplus because the diet is highly diuretic, but this is short lived and you will stall out.

**Narf narf keto flu?**

Some get it, some don't.  If you get a fever and break out in hives, that's not keto flu.  Keto flu is a sense of being lethargic and foggy for a couple of days.  The best cure for keto flu is an understanding that it is basically a hangover.  Your body is starved of the nutrients it is used to, is dehydrated (DRINK YOUR DAMN WATER) and may be lacking in electrolytes.  Meat broth, coffee, and heaps of fat are what you want here.  Also doing what you can to deplete the little amounts of sugar in your body as quickly as possible seem to help get your body into ketosis faster.  My prescription for the keto flu is to go to the gym, do a depletion workout with big heavy weights (squats, brah) and when you're done come back home and have a small meal of nearly entirely fat.  A heavy-cream protein shake, spoonfuls of coconut oil, etc.

**KOLESTERALL???**

Eating cholesterol doesn't make you have high cholesterol, eating fat doesn't make you fat, eating brains doesn't make you smarter.  Eat real foods, your body will reward you.

**Chocklit fatkinz bars!!!!1**

Don't eat that atkins frankenfood bullshit.  It'll turn your ass into a firehose, you'll have to install a seatbelt on your toilet, and you'll probably be kicked out of keto.  Sack up and do your best to kill the sweet tooth, you'll be glad you did.

By popular demand:  **i can haz cheet meel?**

Once again, I'm not your mom.  Do whatever you want.  In relation to ketosis, there seem to be benefits of having a carb-up every so often to break a plateau, largely because it will make you Take A Dump^TM  The danger here is that a cheat meal or cheat day is not an excuse to pack yourself full of poptarts until your blood caramelizes.  Throw in a few carbs and the switch up will help keep your body on its toes.  The additional glycogen that results will also let you have a more intense workout or two which leads to confidence which leads to focus which leads to aesthetics.

First off, in the 6 months I have been on keto I have gone from 543 to 501.  Its much slower than I would have liked, but I also have not been as strict as I would liked and exercise is quite difficult for me.  I had lost weight previous to starting keto and lost about 24 pounds from a 'meal replacement' diet that had left me starve... so my total weight loss today is about 66 pounds!  

Still, 42 pounds from Keto across 6 months is about 7 pounds a month average.  That's more weight than I've ever been able to lose on any diet, EVER.  I have averaged between 1-2 pounds a week which is what my doctor asked me to target :)

When we scheduled the bloodwork I was nervous... but the results came in GREAT.  My good cholesterol had dropped a little (I stopped taking fish oil because I am dumb) and my bad cholesterol had not changed (it was already in a great range).

MOST EXCITING NEWS WAS THAT EVEN AT 500ISH POUNDS AND AT 38, I HAD MANAGED TO EFFECTIVELY REVERSE MY DIABETES.  My glucose levels were in a non diabetic range, without medication.

I have found the diet for me, for a lifetime.  Its slower for me than I would like, but it has had two lasting effects; It has finally curbed my insatiable appetite and it is causing me to lose weight.

To start off with, I am not a doctor and can only speak for my own experiences, but I feel obligated to share them -- partly out of fascination for the results I'm seeing, partly as an outlet.

Some background: I am a 34 year old male, I had a psychotic episode when I was young (late teens), and have been on atypical anti-psychotics since then. I was lucky to have a great support network and the right doctors in the early days, so this enabled me to be a high functioning schizophrenic and bipolar person since then. I've always been employed, independent, stayed out of hospitals, and stuck with my medication. I've followed the advice of doctors and fought against this illness for 15 years and I had come a long way to rise above it on the road to recovery.

The medication has kept me going, and will do, to be sure -- without this element of modern science I doubt I'd ever be here to tell this story. But although to some extent I've been able to put them aside and function well, I've still had nagging and critical voices in my head, mood swings, difficulty concentrating at times, and strong emotional highs and lows.

I'll try to cut the story a bit short here. After 5 weeks on keto I've lost roughly 26 pounds. I feel better than I can ever remember. My brain is firing better than it has in years, but astonishingly the symptoms (voices) have lessened by what must be 90%. Yes. My brain is silent again and I can concentrate. I can read properly again. My wife says my moods are better. The sex is better.

Find it hard to believe? So did I, and so did my doctor. Until I showed him a study from Duke University which reported similar results in a schizophrenic patient on a low-carb, ketogenic diet:

http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/6/1/10

His jaw nearly hit the floor and he's been amazed at my reports of my improved symptoms, my  improved bloodwork, my weight loss, and especially the food choices by which it's happened. :)

Even typing this has been cathartic, so thank you for the outlet. I hope this isn't too loaded, heavy, or inappropriate for this subreddit. Take it as a case of another re-educated doctor -- and an enlightened, happier and healthier person.

The main reason for this is to have something much more accurate than the typically recommended ratios:

http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/

I'd appreciate any feedback!

**UPDATE**: Wow, I did not expect such a big interest! I'm trying to improve the calculator while still keeping it simple, and most importantly as scientific accurate as possible. The latest update now remembers your form data so your data is not lost when you reload the page. If you want something improved, please tell me!

**UPDATE 2**: I had a second look at the protein numbers. I am now using the middle way between the suggestions from [here](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/protein-intake-while-dieting-qa.html), and the book ""The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance"". (I used the numbers from the second source earlier). The protein numbers have therefore increased a bit, when you reload the page.

**UPDATE 3**: A target caloric goal can be chosen, and percentage for MFP are calculated.

**UPDATE 4**: Please see [Keto Calculator 2.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/12amhq/keto_calculator_20/)

**UPDATE 5**: Now it's more flexible. protein intake can be specified, and monthly loss is estimated.

**UPDATE 6**: IE support. Lots of minor changes.

**UPDATE 7**: Now with fancy estimated weight loss chart

**Optimal Metabolism**

If you have trouble maintaining a healthy weight, it’s very likely that you have a problem with how fat cells communicate with your brain Contrary to conventional wisdom, obesity is caused by inﬂammation and hormone mismatches, not by a lack of will-power, lack of exercise, or even calorie intake. Here’s how it really works:

Fat cells secrete a hormone called leptin. Leptin travels from fat cells and tells a part of the brain. the hypothalamus, how much fat you have. Under optimal circumstances, the hypothalamus is very responsive to leptin. When this is the case, the hypothalamus matches appetite and energy expenditure, resulting in easy weight control. Likely you know someone like this. They seem to eat as much as they want, but they always stay lean and ﬁt. This person is leptin sensitive. They have a fat thermostat that works.

On the other hand, in an obese person, the receptors for leptin are damaged, thus making the hypothalamus blind to leptin. Even though such a person might have a hundred pounds Of fat stored on their belly, energy to spare so to speak, the hypothalamus perceives that the body is actually starving. This hormonal “mismatch” drives excessive appetite, cravings, persistent fat storage, low sex hormone production, low thyroid secretion, muscle wasting, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, and fatigue. Such a person is leptin resistant. Their fat thermostat is broken and all the hormones that govern metabolism are deranged. If your hormones are wrong, you can eat like a bird and still gain weight.

So this begs the question, what causes the body to become leptin resistant? Well, there are many reasons, but here are a few of the big ones:

**THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH LEPTIN RECEPTOR DAMAGE:**

* inflammation
* high insulin levels
* poor sleep and/or night shift work
* low Vitamin D
* low Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio of fatty acids
* high blood sugar
* high triglycerides
* elevated LDLp form of cholesterol
* infections (viral, bacterial, ﬁmgal)
* high fructose corn syrup
* lectins and gluten from cereal grains
* an injury or severe illness
* high body fat percentage
* low exercise or sedentary job
* childbirth and/or multiple pregnancies
* too much stress: physical, emotional, or mental
* MSG, aspartame, NutraSweet, BPA, phenylalanine (common in processed foods)

The next question you might be asking yourself is whether it is possible to ﬁx the leptin receptors? Yes, it is, but it requires speciﬁc actions.

**HOW DO YOU HEAL THE LEPTIN RECEPTOR?**

The most important leptin receptors are in the hypothalamus. This is an ancient part of the brain that controls hormones and circadian rhythms. It’s a part of the brain that requires sleep, low stress, low inﬂammation, proper nutrition, and in some cases, cold exposure to work well. Living your life in a way that maximizes hypothalamic function will ﬁx the “biological mismatches” that have fouled up your hormones and metabolism. **Achieving optimal health is all about correcting these mismatches and living as nature intended.**

Resetting your fat thermostat requires **5 LIFESTYLE CHANGES.**

**1.  DEFEAT STRESS: Stress raises cortisol and turns sex hormone production off. It also makes your cells more resistant to insulin. High cortisol and high insulin keep your cells in “fat-storage” not “fat-burning” mode.**

* Decide in your mind that you will be in charge of your health and your life.
* Resolve any high stress conflicts.
* Don’t procrastinate.
* Simplify your life.
* Take 10 slow, deep breathes every hour. This shuts off the sympathetic (panic) nervous system.
* Plan out your meals in advance, so you’re not stressing or scrambling, and eating poor quality food.
* Exercises like yoga, calm walks with a loved-one, and being outdoors help, too.

**2.  EAT FOR YOUR GENES: The USDA food pyramid is not helping the nation’s obesity problem. The Standard American Diet is a complete failure. Our bodies crave nutrient dense food that satisﬁes our physiologic needs 100%, not processed junk and gruel.**

* Eat a “whole food” or “Paleo” style diet. More on diet is explained below.
* Don’t eat any processed, canned, or packaged foods.
* Don’t eat anything with artificial sweeteners. Stevia might be the only exception.
* Eat a **BIG** breakfast with 30-50 grams of protein within an hour of waking up. Eat until you’re quite full. Don’t use protein powder (whey) for this. It causes an insulin and sugar spike.
* Eat 3 meals a day. Avoid snacking. Breakfast is big, lunch a bit smaller, dinner a bit smaller. If you eat a small, low-carb dinner, your liver will burm fat all night long. Eventually you might only need 2 meals a day.
* Eating frequently, especially loads of carbohydrate, keeps insulin “on”. This means you’ll store fat instead of burning it.
* Limit your carbohydrates to around 50-150 grams a day. Eat fewer carbs in the winter, more in the summer.
* Eat dinner 4-5 hours prior to bedtime.

**3.  HACK YOUR SLEEP: Leptin enters the hypothalamus only in the deep stages of sleep. Your brain won’t know how to burn fat without it. We also repair our bodies (autophagy) during sleep. When we don’t repair damage, we a more likely to get cancer. Artiﬁcial light, especially after sunset, turns up cortisol (stress hormone that causes fat storage) and turns off sex hormone production.**

* Expose your eyes to natural sunlight every day, especially in the morning.
* Dim the lights in your entire house after dinner.
* Keep your bedroom cool and dark.
* Don’t read in bed.
* Wear yellow or amber tinted glasses after dimmer time. Yellow lenses block blue wavelength light. Low light levels prepare the brain for sleep.
* No bright lights, T.V., or computer within 90 minutes of bedtime.
* Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep.
* Many people will start to lose weight when they turn off the TV, computer, and iPad when the sun sets.

**4.  HEAL YOUR GUT: The total surface area of the gut lining is nearly two football ﬁelds. Although it is mostly hidden from us, the gut is the main way our body interacts with the outside world. We have 100 times more bacteria in our gut than we have cells in our entire body. The gut bacteria interact with our immune system in a major way. Inﬂammation that damages leptin receptors and triggers auto-immune diseases usually starts in the gut. Healing your gut will promote the maximum absorption of vitamins and minerals and keep “poop” out of your bloodstream. This will calm down inﬂammation and allow the leptin system to heal and function normally. You will also reduce your risk of autoimmune diseases.**

* Avoid cereal grains, seed oils, excessive sugar and especially high fructose com syrup, soy products, beans, excessive lactose and casein. See more on diet below.
* Eat some food with fermentable ﬁbers (starches like sweet potato, yam, tapioca, etc.).
* Eat fermented foods like keﬁr, Greek yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi AND/OR take a high-quality, multi-species pro-biotic tablet.
* Coconut oil is a super food for damaged intestines, also bone broths.
* Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) or PPIs (Prilosec, Nexium) if possible.
* Older patients might need HCL acid supplements.

**5.  TRY SOME COLD THERAPY: Cold exposure turns on growth hormone and GNRH, the hormone that stimulates the sex hormones. These hormones build muscle and bone. Also, the leptin receptors really turn on in the cold. Cold tells your body to turn fat into heat by converting white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and muscle. We are warm-blooded mammals and as such, much of our calorie expenditure every day is related to heat production. You can easily burn as many calories generating body heat as running on a treadmill, for example. Cold exposure also sets the body up for excellent sleep.**

* Drink ice-cold water.
* Apply ice packs to your belly for 20-30 minutes a day (a “Colpac” brand oversized ice pack works Well and can be ordered on Amazon)
* Exercise in colder temperatures.
* Swim in cold water.
* Take some cold showers.
* Work up to taking cold-water baths


**A BIT MORE ON DIET**

The Standard American Diet (S.A.D) is well. ..SAD. Americans suffer from more chronic health problems than any other culture. Why? We eat low-vitamin-content food that our bodies aren't designed to use in an optimal way and that often leaves us feeling unsatisﬁed and hungry.

Much modern “food” messes up digestion, leads to obesity, and triggers or exacerbates many auto-immune diseases.

You are what you eat after all, right?

Why not eat what the human body is designed to consume‘? Eat real food! (Just in case you were
wondering, a Twinkie is not real food.)

Here’s what I avoid eating: **1) sugar, 2) grains, and 3) vegetable oils.** Along with the “big 3” listed above, I don’t eat many legumes and not much milk.

The above mentioned foods are toxic to some degree for most people. Although these foods don’t typically make us acutely ill, we are more likely to develop “chronic” problems if we eat them for long enough: obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. I call such problems **diseases of civilization** because they rarely existed prior to the modem diet or among present-day indigenous cultures that eat natural foods. I ﬁnd that quite interesting.

If you avoid “the big 3” mentioned above, you are Lmlikely to be obese or get Type 2 diabetes, and you’ll also reduce your risk of cancer, auto-immune disease, and heart disease. Here’s a short explanation why I don’t eat these foods.

* **Sugar** causes insulin spikes and damages the leptin receptors in the brain that control appetite. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar from going too high after you eat by storing that sugar as fat. Insulin spikes are bad because they trigger excessive appetite and eventually, obesity. Insulin spikes also burn out the pancreas, which leads to Type 2 diabetes. Sugar in the diet also causes “glycation”, an oxidative process that damages tissues, especially arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart attacks. Glycation also damages the “appetite control” leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Having damaged leptin receptors puts your metabolism into “starvation mode”, even if you have too much fat already. Not good. Sugar makes you fat, especially around the waist, and the bigger your belly, the more likely you are to get diabetes or heart problems.
* **Grains** trigger a hyperactive immune response in many people and damage the protective lining of the gut. This makes the gut “leaky” which allows all sorts of bad things to enter the circulation that shouldn’t — like poop! When the immune system has to deal with more than it can handle, it can inadvertently attack “innocent bystanders” like thyroid tissue, brain tissue, skin tissue, lung tissue, etc. This haphazard stimulation of the immune system can exacerbate thyroid problems, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, eczema and many others. Many of these problems start with a “leaky gut” issue. Another problem with grains, it that they spike insulin levels just as much as pure sugar does. They also contain “phytates” that interfere with calcium, copper, magnesium, iron, and zinc absorption. Lastly, practically all grain these days is genetically modiﬁed, which makes them a questionable food source, at best. So with grains, you give yourself a triple whammy: hyperactive insulin, a hyperactive immune system, and lousy mineral absorption. Can the human organism survive on a grain based diet? Yes, of course it can, but we want the very best fuel for our bodies, not gruel.
* Just like grains, **vegetable oils and margarine** have chemical structures that ﬁre up the immune system in an indiscriminate fashion. Vegetable oils such as those derived from sunﬂower, safﬂower, canola, com, and soybeans contain an excessive amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids. If you eat too much omega-6, your body over-produces inﬂammatory proteins that can lead to health problems and pain. Additionally, most soy and com these days is also genetically modiﬁed.

Can we survive on a diet based on sugar, grain, and vegetable oil? Yes, of course, but this is not optimal. When you are trying to restore your health, survival foods are not going to cut it. You need to eat foods that satisfy the dictates of our evolutionary heritage to have optimal health.

So, what’s good to eat?

* Pretty much all **veggies** in any quantity you like. Get all the colors: green, yellow, red, purple, orange, and white, but go easy on the starchy potatoes if you want to lose weight. It’s best to eat these in spring, summer and fall, a bit less in winter. Organic is better if you can afford it. Growing your own is the very best, in my opinion.
* **Fruit**: 2-3 pieces of fruit a day is okay, but eat less if you have diabetes, need to lose some weight, or have irritable bowels. Our hormones and metabolism are set up to eat fruit when the days are long and getting cooler —late summer and autumn. That’s the best time to eat them.
* **Fish**, including the skin if you like it. Salmon is a super-food. So are sardines. Eat ﬁsh often. If you don’t like ﬁsh, take a ﬁsh oil, cod liver oil, or krill oil supplements to get your Omega-3 fatty acids. The longest lived people in the world all eat **seafood: shrimp, scallops, lobster, clams, mussels**, etc. **I challenge all my patients to eat some ﬁsh or seafood every day.**
* **Seaweed** is a super-food and can be a daily addition to your diet. If you decide to do a very low-carb, ketogenic type diet, you need the iodine in seafood to keep your thyroid going. Kelp tablets can help get the iodine you need on days you don’t eat seafood.
* Grass-fed or “free-range” meat: **beef, lamb, pork, turkey, chicken,** etc. **Wild game** is great, too. Grass-fed meat and wild game has higher Omega-3s and many other nutrients than does “feed-lot” produced meat. Find a local rancher if you can. Store bought meat is not as good, but it’s okay. KSL classiﬁeds can be a good resource for this.
* **Butter, ghee, or cream** from pasture-fed cows. Milk is loaded with carbs, so drink water instead. I restrict dairy products in some patients, but for starters, it’s probably okay.
* **Eggs**, especially from “free-range” chickens that can eat insects, worms, and grass.
* **Organ meats like liver and heart**, especially if you’re one of 25% of the population that doesn’t convert beta-carotene to real vitamin A. Butchers can mix these into hamburger for you if you don’t like it plain. Menstruating women can really get a boost from these iron-rich super-foods. Eat less of these if you have high ferritin or iron levels.
* **Bone broths**. Critical if you have arthritis, cartilage damage, herniated discs, or osteoporosis.
* **Ghee, lard, butter, tallow, or coconut oil** are great for cooking.
* **Macadamia nut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil** are useful for dressings.
* Small amounts of nuts are good for you. Macadamias are the lowest in Omega-6. Don’t go nuts on nuts, however. They are an accessory food.
* Eat foods with “healthy” bacteria: **kefir, Greek yogurt, homemade sauerkraut,** etc.
* **Dark chocolate**, 65% and up is best.
* Drink plenty of **ice-cold water**. Green tea is okay. Coffee if you like. Avoid other beverages.
* **Himalayan Pink Salt**. This salt has dozens of trace minerals and is vastly superior to table salt. It does not have iodine, however, but if you’re eating plenty of seafood and seaweed, you’ll be getting all the iodine you need. 
* **Sweet potatoes** are a safe, starchy food. If you’re athletic and need to “carb-load” this is the best food to do it with.
* Do not eat packaged and processed foods. Avoid soda, additives and preservatives. If it has a long shelf life, you should not put it in your body.

Beans and other legumes are okay when sprouted or cooked for a long-time, but these foods have proteins that can damage the gut lining in some people, just like the grains do, so I can’t give them a total green light. They might be okay in small amounts. Personally, I’ve stopped eating them.

If you want to lose weight, keep your daily carbohydrate intake at around 50 -100 grams and get the rest of your calories for the day from fat and protein. If there is a secret to weight loss, this is it. Use the website Fitday to calculate your carbohydrate intake.

Most people will be less hungry on this diet and won’t need to cotmt calories. Just eat until you feel satisﬁed, but not “stuffed.”

Here’s a site with plenty of recipes: [http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex](http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex), but meals can be very simple: some meat or seafood, an egg or two, some veggies, and a slice of fruit. Done.

Read Mark Sisson. His website also has a lot of great information: [www.marksdailyapple.com](http://www.marksdailyapple.com).

[http://perfecthealthdiet.com](http://perfecthealthdiet.com) is another resource I like.

**HOW WILL YOU KNOW YOUR “FAT THERMOSTAT” IS WORKING AGAIN?**

* Hunger and cravings greatly diminish
* Sleeping like a rock
* Feeling refreshed in the morning
* Less muscle soreness
* Mental calmness
* Steady weight loss
* Increased libido
* Softer skin and stronger nails
* Improved mental ability
* Fewer headaches
* Dreaming, especially about moving your body (dancing, exercising, exploring, etc.)
* More energy
* Firmer gums, smoother teeth

**WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE?**

It’s important to wait until you have some clear signs of leptin sensitivity prior to working out hard. If you push it too soon, you can damage your stem cells and push cortisol levels up before your metabolic and hormonal systems are ready. Once you have 5-6 signs of leptin sensitivity (from the above list), you can start doing more exercise: walking, lifting weights, calisthenics, and eventually sprinting. You don’t ever have to jog again! (If you don’t want to, that is.) Exercise outdoors whenever possible. Long-distance running and cycling are not the best exercise for losing weight. Weight training, sprinting, and body—weight exercises like push-ups and squats are better. If you do these types of exercises at a high intensity level, your heart and lungs will get plenty of a workout. Work into exercise slowly. For many people, it’s a good idea to get a treadmill test prior to working out to make sure your heart is good to go for it.

**WHAT PROBLEMS MIGHT ARISE WITH A BIG DIET CHANGE?**

* Moodiness — This can be mitigated with a 5-HTP supplement, B complex vitamins, and selenium. Also, fat is your friend with this one. Eat more coconut oil, olive oil, cream, butter, fatty ﬁsh like salmon, or bacon. Eating a high tryptophan food, like turkey, along with a little bolus of carbs, like sweet potatoes, can boost serotonin levels pretty quickly, too. 
* Headache, muscle weakness, and dizziness. These will go away as your body builds up its fat buming machinery, usually within a week.
* Smelly urine — this is from ketones in the urine and it generally a sign that you’re eating enough protein and the right amount of carbs. Don’t be alarmed.
* Constipation — If this happens, eat more vegetables. They are full of soluble ﬁber and have less of a “glycemic-load” than fruit or prunes. Ground ﬂax seeds and magnesium work well, too.
* Some people, especially women, do better with a slow decrease in the amount of carbs. You can follow higher carbohydrate version of the Pale diet without eating gluten grains or sugars, just eat sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, or rice instead. As your fat burning machinery kicks in, you’ll be able to decrease carbs to 50 -150 grams/day eventually without feeling irritable.
* Plateaus: These are to be expected. Weight loss and metabolic optimization often progress in ﬁts and starts. You are rebuilding your metabolism and this takes time. If you plateau at a certain Weight for more than a month, there’s probably a hormone problem to address. See me and we’ll ﬁgure it out with some labs and a review of your diet, sleep, and exercise pattems.


In general, I’m not a big fan of supplements, but most people with broken down metabolism and hormone problems have nutritional deﬁciencies that can be helped in the short term by medications or supplements. Once you are at a healthy weight and have eaten well for 6-12 months, they typically are not necessary.

For everyone:


* A high quality **multivitamin** helps because if you’re not eating a good diet, it’s very likely you have vitamin and mineral deﬁciencies. It’s expensive to test for everything, so this is just a low-risk, low cost way to get up to normal.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids** via ﬁsh oil or krill oil help restore the balance of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids. These two fatty acids use the same enzyme pathway, so if you have too much of one, it outcompetes the other. Essentially all Americans are overloaded with Omega-6 from packaged foods, margarine, and vegetable oil. Too much Omega-6 causes persistent inﬂammation that damages the leptin receptors (and everything else for that matter.) I can take years of eating well to get to the proper balance. If you eat ﬁsh daily you probably don’t need a supplement. If you don’t eat much ﬁsh, take l-3 tablets a day.
* **Vitamin D** is low in most of my patients, so get it tested. Some people need high dosages to get to optimal ranges. I test my level a few times a year. Taking 2000 IU daily is okay to start, but many people need more. A good level is between 50-100.
* **Magnesium** is a required co-factor to make A/TP, which powers all of your cells. Magnesium competes for absorption with Vitamin D, so spacing these two supplements by 12 hours helps. Most people should take 400-800mg daily in the form of magnesium glycinate, threonate, or malate. Magnesium oxide is more readily available in stores, but doesn’t work quite as well.

For special circmnstances:

* **5-HTP** helps if you get moody while adjusting to a new diet. This is a serotonin precursor.
* **PQQ** (pyrroloquinoline quinone) helps rebuild muscle mitochondria.
* **Vitamin K2** is a co-factor for calcium-binding enzymes. This is good for people with osteoporosis, along with Vitamin D. Naturally it occurs in fermented foods. Post- menopausal women need this as much as calcium and vitamin D.
* **Ubiquinol** (the more costly form of Co-enzyme Q10) helps rebuild mitochondria in the muscles. This can really help when you’re ready to start more vigorous exercise.
* **DHEA** can help if you have a sex hormone deﬁciency or pregnenolone steal syndrome. It also helps with sleep. Men can take 50 -100mg. Women can start around 25mg. Repeat testing is essential with this one.

****EDIT****

There is a lot of discussion as to whether or not calories count in a diet.  I think one of the goals of this document is to look at it a bit differently than we have in the past.

[Leptin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin) is fairly new in our understanding of health.  It was discovered in 1994!  Just a couple of weeks ago, the news was all over a new study showing the effect of fructose has on the body and its inhibition of leptin receptors (http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/01/13393/sugar-fights-still-simmer-new-brain-study-finds-fructose-might-stimulate-appetite)  Please read the UCSF article!!

This document is making the case, that calorie counting when you have damaged leptin receptors does not work like it should.  After you have repaired those receptors and stop taking in things that damage them (things you find in modern diet), then calories are now doing what they should be.  You will make better decisions (making it easier to calorie count) because you are not as hungry, and your brain isn't confused as to how much storage it has.

So - both sides are correct.  Calorie counting should not be discounted, and strict calorie counting does not work for everyone.

(to date). I struggled with a fat ass my whole life until I found this little corner of the intertubes. I learned how to lose weight, keep it off (mostly), and get a daily dose of inspiration when browsing /r/keto and it's sister subs.

But I can't stop thinking about what I read yesterday. Like many of you fellow ketoers being excited to have lost that ___ number of pounds and wanting to share, Honeymaid posted his pics obviously happy to have lost fat and gain muscle. He also wanted to thank /r/keto for being there for him. Here's where things took a turn for the worse.

Let me say, these are my favorite types of posts. I get inspired by the ""look at me fat/look at me not"" pics and the accompanying ""how I did it with bacon"". But for the first time since starting to follow /r/keto, I was speechless at some of the mean spirited comments heaped on Honeymaid. People felt the need to tear him down because he happens to wear a nose ring (I like it Honeymaid). One person went so far as to let him know he shouldn't even be posting this to /r/keto, apparently he didn't lose enough fat for that persons tastes.

Put yourselves in Honeymaids shoes for a minute. Here is a person happy that he is finally happy with his self and wants to thank our community for helping him get there. He even posts his before/after pics, which I always commend because at that moment you give up your intertube anonymity and expose yourself to the world.

Instead of getting pure inspirational comments, which is all I ever see for what it's worth, he gets inspirational comments mixed with a healthy dose of mean spirited comments on his looks among other things. This isn't a fashion show or high school /r/keto, this is real people just trying to better themselves and occasionally sharing their stories with the community.

**TL/DR: I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and bacon and we'd all eat it and be happy...**

**Edit: Sorry I opened this can of worms everyone, please accept my apologies. And you get some bacon, and you get some bacon, and YOU get some bacon!**

But I came across some gamechangers. These are a couple of the things that, for me, made this lifestyle totally realistic and even enjoyable.

**1) [This julienne peeler](http://www.amazon.com/Messermeister-Pro-Touch-Orange-Julienne-Cutter/dp/B003CT3S00/).**

Dude, let me tell you right now that if you think shirataki is fucking gross, stop buying it. One of these $8 thingies will give you all that you want without soy water stink. I MEAN [WOULD YOU JUST LOOK AT THESE ZUCCHINI NOODLES](http://i.imgur.com/7XLFRXr.jpg) HOLY SHIT.

Took me all of 90 seconds to do two big ass zukes and I do declare they make better tasting spaghetti than real noodles. I also use them in pad thai and curry. I mean sure carbs but they're so minimal and hey vegetables. Which leads into..

**2) Coconut. You can get oil in a jar, you can get flour in a bag, you can even get it in a god damn [cooking oil spray can](http://imgur.com/SUPuhu6).**

Add some butter and sweetener to the flour, awesome shortbread crust! Freeze a bowl of sweetener, cocoa and coconut oil for 10 minutes and you've got some lazy ass late night keto chocolate. The coconut cream at Trader Joe's I can practically eat out of the can, but I like to just heat it with a couple tablespoons of curry paste and toss it on some vegetables.

**3) Speaking of sweeteners: [EZ-Sweetz](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O/) is rad.** I ordered this stuff like 9 months ago and I use it all the goddamn time. Still have half a bottle left. Very no-fuss and super cost-effective.

**4) [Lazy keto chicken](http://cavemanketo.com/2012/06/23/lazy-keto-chicken/). It's the total weeknight warrior of keto recipes.** Anyone can make this and everyone should.

**5) [Yanni grilling cheese](https://www.karouncheese.com/images/products/155_tn330_Yanni-grilling-cheese-8oz.jpg). You put it in a pan and it [COMES OUT LIKE THIS!!](http://i.imgur.com/P0jMduV.jpg)** Okay so I had just fried bacon in that pan so it's not the prettiest shot, but damn it was good.

Once I tried to make mozzarella sticks and that was really LOL so I saw this stuff at Ralph's for $5 and gave it a shot. I swear to god it tastes like pizza hut stuffed crust.

I think we were both in the 280-lb range. [2009](http://i.imgur.com/HRoRHPH.jpg)


This is us when he hit 300, and I had gotten to (at least) 310. [Summer2010](http://i.imgur.com/uXehse7.jpg)


And this is from fall, where he was at 185 and I was somewhere around 218. [October2012](http://i.imgur.com/xVOo5oe.jpg)

I believe he's the same right now, he's putting on more muscle.... and today I clocked in at 199!!!! I haven't seen 190-anything since middle school. I'll have to get an updated pic of the two of us. We've both been big our whole lives.

We had to spend some time apart during college, and he had started keto back in fall-winter of 2010. He told me about it, but I didn't think it would do anything for me. He kept losing weight and in January he joined the Navy. By the time he graduated from basic he was down to 185. I think he only lost 10 lbs during bootcamp.

The weekend he graduated, (In Sept 2011) I went home and started p90x (which before, I had failed to complete several times) and he guided me in how to change my eating. I never worried about keto-sticks and I had a lot of slip ups with eating early on. I can't believe my cheating didn't hinder me as much as it should have.

So I eased into keto, since he originally just wanted me to go low carb.

I'd say we've been super strict with absolutely no bad stuff for about a year now. 

It kind of blows my mind that so far we've lost so much weight that you could ""make"" a third person that's a little heavier than either of us. And I'm still going!

Here's a small ""headless fat person"" pic of me before I started. For some reason. It's really hard to find any full body pics. I had trashed my original before pictures because I thought I would never lose anything. What a shame. [me, oh god](http://i.imgur.com/hc7GthI.jpg)

I've completed one month (1 month and 4 days, now I suppose.) of keto, and I'm so happy with my results that I'd love to scream it to the world.  I'm sure they don't want to hear it though, so I thought I'd show off to you guys, instead.

I'm incorporating cardio and just a tiny bit of strength training in with keto, keeping my ratios as near to 60f/35p/5c as possible.  I'm eating 1200 cal a day (More on my exercise days, of course.) and doing my best to stick to 10 carbs a day.  I figure if I stick to 10, it gives me wiggle room for carbs I may not know about.  I've broken it and went up to 15 on occasion, but for the most part I've done well to stick to my goals.  

As far as scale victories, I've lost 17 lbs on keto.  I've went from 196 to 179. A very, very good portion of that was water weight - I was retaining water like crazy before I started, because I rarely drank water.  It was all energy drinks and soda for me.  My goal weight is 125.

Non-scale victories are increasing rapidly for me.  I've moved 4 notches on my belt and went down a pants size.  We live near an army post, and a few gate guards now have asked me how much I've lost so far when I handed them my I.D., and told me how great I look.  My husband, son and friends are telling me they can see the difference.  I even bought my first medium (men's medium, I hate women's clothing.  But still a medium!) shirt the other day.

I'm not tired all the time anymore, and I actually look forward to exercise.  I feel better than I have since before I had my son, eight years ago.

Now, on to the pics!  First from the front, then from the side - both going from start date/two weeks in/now.  NSFW as I'm in my bra.  I look like crap in the last set too, I was really tired from a loooong day.

I'm sticking to this, it kicks butt. :)

- Kerrygold Butter. It's 2.99! Wowthat'scheap. Carbs: 0

- Marcona Almonds with Rosemary. 4.49 Carbs: 1/4 c. is 5 carbs, but 3 are dietary fiber. Cray yummy.

- Extra Virgin Organic Coconut Oil. 5.99. This is cheaper than anywhere else.

- Bacon - beef, pork AND turkey. The Center Cut is the best, but all varieties are GMO free and start at 3.99

- Carne Asada Beef. Weighed by pound. 1 carb/per 4 oz. Pre seasoned and delicious for the lazy.

- Almond Meal. 2.99. Whaaaat. So cheap, and 1/4 C. has 2 carbs - 1 of those being dietary fiber. 

- Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. 2.99. 1 cup has 2 carbs, 1 being dietary fiber. Dude, this stuff rules.

- Soy Creamer. 1.49. Tired of Dairy? 1 carb per tablespoon, and that's all you need for coffee goodness.

- Frozen Wild Alakan Cod. Price varies. So good, and 1 package (about 6 dollars) lasted me two meals. I chose to defrost and bread these in the almond meal and fry in coconut oil. BAM.

- Wasabi Mayo. 1.99. Spicy. 

- ONE OF THE BEST DEALS: Vitamin D. 4.99. For a lot of it. This is half the price of what I've seen it for in other health food stores.

- Ghost Chills. 4.99. Want spice? Babam. Use with caution.

- In fact, most spices we have there are carb free. I reccomend the Garlic Salt and Lemon Pepper. They come with grinders and are only 1.99.  

-Aside from those specifics, I got a buttton of veggies at a good price, sour cream, and other small fatty sundries. 

Hope this helps.

1363808773.0,497,self.keto,1aolg9,[Rant] Is Butter a Carb? The Continuing Misadventures of Explaining Keto to My Father,596,99,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1aolg9/rant_is_butter_a_carb_the_continuing/,"My dad can eat a half gallon of ice cream by himself in one night. And he does.  

When I was a baby, my grandmother used to put Pepsi in my bottle, and later coffee with milk and a lot of sugar in my sippy cup. ""What!"" she'd say to my incredulous mother as I ran circles around the dining room table, practically frothing at the mouth. ""She can have a little. What's the harm?""   

So yes, I know exactly where my sugar addiction comes from. And I also know that, for most of us, the road to carb hell is paved with the sweet intentions of relatives. *Eat, you're too skinny. Have another helping, I made too much pasta. Try my ice cream. Do you want another piece of pie?* These people - we love 'em, but come on - are the reason that *some of us* have been known to sleepwalk to the kitchen and eat an entire cake at 3am.   

Okay, so it was me. Whatever, right? We're all friends here, so I will tell you that I ate the absolute shit out of that cake, man. The scary part is that I would have no recollection of eating an entire 8-inch layer cake by myself if not for the forensic evidence:  a morning-after ring of chocolate around my mouth, or telltale chocolate frosting drool stains on my pillow. Did I use a fork, or did I just go at it with my bare hands, like a fucking raccoon foraging in a dumpster? Couldn't tell you. I like to imagine it like the sleepwalking scene in Step Brothers.  

I will also confess that this happened way more than once. Waking up to get a snack (sugar; always sugar) was a near-nightly ritual for me. One time I woke up with my sheets covered in chocolate streaks and a chocolate-chip cookie stuck to the small of my back, but I was drunk and that's another story entirely. Don't judge me.         

When I started keto in September, I explained it to my dad as simply as I could: low carb, which means no rice, no bread, no pasta, no flour, and absolutely no sugar. He looked at me as if I had told him I was going to start shooting heroin to curb my appetite. He asked if this was a fad diet. He offered me a pack of Oreos. Now, my dad is Southern. *Really* Southern. He speaks slowly and sometimes it takes him a while to process the things his overly-excitable, fast-talking, Northern-raised daughter is telling him. It's like a sitcom up in here. We like to joke that Saturday Night Live is really funny for him Sunday morning. I'm not saying he's stupid, because he's not: he just likes to take his time with things. So I try really hard to be forgiving when he offers me something that I can't have, even though the impatient Yankee in me is screaming that it has now been six months, goddamnit dad six months, and if I haven't eaten that fucking Moon Pie yet I'm probably not going to.  

Sometimes a simple ""no thank you"" doesn't appease him and I have to take whatever he's offered me or he'll follow me around for a while, waving a candy bar vaguely in my direction and telling me I should try one because it's got *caramel* in it, or something. My dad is like a lovable, hapless drug pusher. I usually just put it back in his sugar stash once he's gone, but it drives me absolutely nuts. I'm sure my fellow ketonians know exactly what I'm talking about, here. The unrelenting, misunderstanding, but ultimately well-meaning relative. Can't kill 'em, can't get 'em to stop offering you some of their ice cream.  

The worst is when he thinks he's following my diet. Somewhere along the line he heard ""bacon good"" - and this part stuck ok - but ""bread bad"" still fails to compute, despite countless explanations. He'll make a bacon sandwich and then tell me that he likes ""this new style of eating."" Or I'll make something keto-friendly and he'll go on and on about how great the dish would be with a side of buttered rice. Last night he saw me eat a tablespoon of peanut butter and so he definitely just walked in and asked if I wanted half of his peanut butter and banana sandwich. I love him, I really do, but oh my god some days it's like he's doing it deliberately. And today I was feeling really bad about myself, so I almost said yes - screw it - gimme the fuckin' Elvis Special.  

But I didn't. Tiny victories.   

People love to tell you how to eat. This will not change, not ever. Even fellow Ketonians are guilty, and I've definitely caught myself doing it, too. You have to remember that these people generally mean well, even when the things they say are hurtful or woefully misinformed. Everyone has an opinion and you won't change their minds, so you have to change the way you respond to it. Don't take it personally, even though it may be really hard not to. I know that my dad just wants me to be happy. Sugar makes him happy; sugar used to make me happy, too - and so did bread and all of that junk. But now my priorities have shifted. Being able to run without having a coughing fit, not having crippling acid reflux, having a better quality of life: these are the things that make me happy now. But sugar is still there, lurking in cabinets and grocery store bakery cases and even in my dad's well-meaning hand, waiting for me to slip up and come crawling back.   

Even if I did take the bait it would be my own fault, not my dad's. I know this. Through this huge lifestyle change I've learned to take responsibility for my choices, no matter how much it blows sometimes. So what if I was practically bred to be a sugar addict - I don't have to choose to eat that shit anymore. And make no mistake, an addict is exactly what I am. The first step is admitting you have a problem, right? I can't have cheat days, because I know I won't stop. I'll backslide right back into the lifestyle that made me feel like shit, made my asthma worse, made my stomach hurt constantly. And while I don't look down upon the people who can treat themselves and then jump back on the wagon, I have to accept that I am just not one of them.  

So no matter how many times a day my dad offers me something that I used to love, I'm going to hold fast and decline. And I'm going to do my best to do so gently because he really does mean well. I'm going to learn from my past, but I can't allow myself to repeat it. Or forget it.   

I'm always going to be the girl who sleepwalked to cake.

1362444634.0,499,self.keto,19oaio,Twelve things I've learned from Keto.,599,100,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/19oaio/twelve_things_ive_learned_from_keto/,"I'm making this post both for newbies and those considering adopting TKD, just to give some more perspective on it from someone who's been on the diet for a while, and for fellow ketoers who will probably recognise a lot of these things from their own experiences:

**1. Everyone is a nutritionalist.** You can scarcely describe the ketogenic diet to a layperson without having them either lecture you about how awful it is, or secretly think you're some poor idiot who's just fallen for a fad diet. I've even had people ask me how I lost weight, and when I describe keto, even then they'll tell me that it can't work.


**2. EVERYONE is a nutritionalist.** Including you. Let's say I know about 3% about all their is to know about human nutrition, I can run into a person who follows the whole low-fat and calories-in calories-out dogma, and let's say they know 0.5% of all there is to know about human nutrition. It's very easy for me to think 'Hey, I'm six times smarter than this person, I ought to tell them what they should and shouldn't eat', but what I'm forgetting is that massive 97% of knowledge I don't have, and that, really, it's best for a variety of reasons to just keep my mouth shut. That, or anything I DO say should be contextualised to my personal experience, rather than giving generalized theories about nutrition, weight loss and health.


**3. People are bias in favour of simple, easily understood explanations for things.** This can be described as the drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost--he looks there because there's light enough for him to see, not because that's where they're most likely to be. I've often been asked to describe how my diet has worked for me to lose weight, and when I start talking about different hormones, insulin, and metabolism, sometimes with long words, I can see the look of zoning-out in the face. Further, people don't like the idea that one problem might have two different causes. On [a recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/19kt53/rantif_i_hear_calories_in_vs_calories_out_is_bs/c8oys5p) in this subreddit, two Redditors were having the insulin vs calories argument, both with evidence to back up their claims; what neither of them realised† was that they *both* might be right and that, believe it or not, obesity might have more than one cause. If you accept that, then you can accept that obesity might also have more than one cure.

**4. The 'Fat bias' is really, really strong.** Even for people who embrace the caloric balance theory of weight gain loss and management. Take, for instance, a Thai red curry: were you to add 45g of heavy cream to it, it's suddenly unhealthy; but were you to add 100g of white rice to it, you've somehow made it a perfectly balanced and healthy meal. This despite the fact that they have roughly the same amount of calories, and the cream at least has some calcium.

**5. Weight loss is very unpredictable in the short- and medium-term.** I plateau for no reason. Sometimes I'll lose a lot of weight even when I'm drinking alcohol, sometimes I'll lose no weight even when I'm doing IF. Referring back to points 2 and 3, we just don't have all the information to know exactly what's going on in our bodies. They are such complicated machines with so many thousands of processes going on, and so many variables, our bias for a simple explanation leads us to oversimplified ideas of what's happening in our bodies in the short- and medium-term.


**6. Exercise isn't necessary for weight loss.** So whenever I hear some twit on the TV pontificating about how you *have* to exercise and *have* to get your heart rate up to some arbitrary bpm, I now know they are talking directly out of their arse.


**7. Convenience = Carbohydrates.** Of the three major macronutrients, carbohydrates are by far the cheapest. Naturally, if the food isn't made by you, then the person or company selling it to you is going to try their best to get out all the costly fat and protein, and load it up with cheap cheap carbohydrates. 

**8. Most foods can be replicated to be keto friendly, but not all.** I've baked a few cheesecakes since starting keto which were delicious, but my attempts at nachos, dumplings, and pasta have all ended in disaster. Pork rinds with guac, salsa, sour cream and cheese just didn't cut it, and shiratake noodles just taste like failure. Moussaka is just as delicious as lasagna, but I'm giving up on carbonara and bolognese altogether. Nothing can replace a wanton.


**9. Strangers will have more time for you, be more polite and respectful to you, and take you more seriously about any topic... when you're thin.** I imagine this is because when you're fat, strangers' initial impression of you is that you've failed at something, so you're starting at a disadvantage. Or it could be that usually you're just more attractive when you're thin and strangers have a bias for attractive people.


**10. Being fat doesn't mean you will necessarily have a loose skin problem when you lose the weight.** I've lost on average about 0.6kg (or 1 and a third lbs) per week over the last ten months. That totals 25.5kg, or roughly 55lbs, and I have no problems with loose skin or sagging anything. I am 27 (28 in three months), so my youth might be a factor, but for anyone my age or younger, lose it slowly and you'll be fine.


**11. If you can't sell a supplement, exercise machine or some other gizmo, nobody will promote the diet.** I've gone around the merry-go-round of silly diets, weight loss supplements and exercise machines. Some worked, none I stuck to for more than a few months at a time. I've found keto so easy to stick to, with such predictable results over the long term, AND with spending so little money, it really infuriates me to see sharks and low-lives trying to exploit the fat and confused, and use their misery to grind money out of them. 

**12. Keep calm and Keto on**. It's really just excellent advice--your health and personal well being is more important than somebody else's paranoia or stupid opinions, so whatever the difficulty, you know that keto will work in the long term and the results will speak for themselves. That's the advantage that this wonderful diet and lifestyle affords you, so take advantage of it.

I want to close with a quote; it's from British Economist John Maynard Keynes, who was referring to governments' economic policy, but is such a wonderfully clever quote that I find it perfectly applies to the mainstream approach to nutrition and weight management today:

**""Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally""** 
-The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, Book IV Chapter 12

But Almond Thins are just like crackers, and you can choose your flavor. I prefer an onion and garlic and have them with some creamy french onion dip. but also a nice treat is cinnamon-thins (linda's other recipe for almond thins) which I dip into peanut butter or chocolate spread.

*one recipe note: I reduced the sugar per serving by about half and they came out great. don't need that much sweet in my crackers. 

Also, i tripled the recipe and it made approx. 50 1"" x 2.5"" cracker rectangles

1375702623.0,470,self.keto,1jqgav,"""In Ketosis"" vs. ""Keto-adapted""",580,110,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jqgav/in_ketosis_vs_ketoadapted/,"I feel a need to clarify the difference between being ""in ketosis"" and being ""keto-adapted""

The point of a keto diet is to be in ketosis - what this means is that your body is breaking down fat at such a rate that there are ketones in your bloodstream. This happens after fasting, or with a low carb diet. It's a normal metabolic state. If you've ever had steak and veggies for supper and then had eggs for breakfast (or skipped it all together), you've been in ketosis. 

It's also important to note that your body burns whatever fuel is available - glucose, FFA (free fatty acids), ketones, alcohol. Whatever there is more of is what it burns more (which is why alcohol ""pauses"" ketosis, your body will burn up the alcohol first). 

Ketostix will measure excess ketones that are in your urine. However they are not the be all and end all of being in ketosis. If you are using all your ketones for energy, or if you're getting rid of the excess through sweat or saliva, ketostix may be negative. 

One of the goals of the keto diet is being ""keto adapted"". This means that your body is primed for functioning with very little glucose. Different enzymes are involved for breaking down fat than breaking down glucose. When you first enter ketosis, you are using fat for energy, but at first it's in limited amounts because you don't have as many fat-converting enzymes. These get built up over time. This is what causes the tiredness at the beginning of the diet. Once the enzymes are in place, your cells change the way they get energy. It's really amazing all the changes that have to happen internally for keto-adaptation to happen. It's like you can't just put diesel into a regular car engine and expect everything to work smoothly. 

Once you are keto-adapted (which can take a few weeks to a month depending on the person), fat/ketones becomes the preferred fuel. Hormone levels are changed, glycogen (glucose stored in muscles and liver) is lowered, you carry less excess water. You're able to function well - lots of energy, you can exercise, lift, build up endurance etc. 

When you're keto adapted and get an ""overdose"" of carbs (more than your body needs at the time) different things happen. First, glycogen gets replenished, which causes water retention. Secondly, insulin rises, which can affect other hormone levels as well. While your body processes the carbs, you are not burning ketones. Once the glucose is dealt with, you will go back into ketosis. When you're keto adapted, this doesn't take long because you already have the enzymes and are ""primed"" to use fat for energy. 

When you're starting keto, the more often you have sugar, the longer it takes to become keto adapted. When you are keto adapted, sugar will will still take precedence over fat for fuel (because excess blood sugar is fatal and so your body *needs* to handle the sugar first). 

If your goal is weight loss, excess glucose is counter productive. There is no ""need"" for a carb up, even with endurance sports, but some people find the boost helpful depending on their goals (Peter Attia has said he doesn't use any carbs unless he is cycling more than 3 hrs, so if you're under that, going carb free is at the very least possible). Even building muscle while in ketosis is possible, just ask those over at /r/ketogains

My wife was quite supportive in the beginning but since some time she's bugging me to eat fruit because vitamins and stuff... I told her all about vitamins in fruit and how I get enough vitamins through veggies and my daily vitamin pill but she doesn't listen and wants me to have my blood tested. You probably already see where this is going...
Today we had a visit at the doc because of a minor thing that she has (don't worry she's fine) and when her examination was done she said ""why don't you ask the doc about this diet of yours?"". So I tell him that I'm on low carb, I don't eat bread, sugar, fruit, potatoes and whatnot. I tell him that I lost quite some fat and that I feel fitter and better then ever. He says ""Listen I know what you are doing. You can quote me on this. Keep it up. This is the best thing that you can do for yourself. Know that there are no essential sugars. Essential as in needed for the human body. There is no such thing as an essential sugar or carb. Fat, amino acid, protein - all essential, but not sugar. If you want it we can test your blood so that your wife is happy but I don't see a reason for that.""
I'm really curious as to how she will treat my diet after this.
So if you need another argument for your diet it's this - sugar and carbs are not essential while fat, amino acid and protein are.

And while I'm at it - yesterday I bought myself a nice new suit. Size 48. I could not believe it. And I might say I look really dashing in it. The last suit I bought a couple of months ago was a size 54...

Still, Ive had great sucess with keto, and I have been enjoying my meals.

So heres a list of quick, easy, non-obstrusive meals for keto'ers who arent experienced cooks, and/or who dont have full control over their kitchens, their fridges, and their shopping lists.

**Breakfasts**

* 2 eggs: Fryed or however you prefer, just scramble them if the yolk breaks or you ""screw up"" somehow.

* Cream cheese wrapped in sandwitch meat. Ham, turkey, whatever. 2 ""rolls"" is a decent sized breakfast

* Tuna salad. A can of tuna, some mayo, and some celery

* Nuts and dairy. Mix nuts of almost whatever kind, with either yogurt, cottage cheese, or cream cheese. (Caution: some yogurt and cottage cheese are not keto friendly, even those that are are just barely acceptable)

(have some lettuce or spinach with any/all of these breakfasts)

**Lunches**

* ""BLT salad"". Exactly what it sounds like.

* Chef's salad. Hardboiled eggs, meat (just lunch meat is fine), and cheese on a bed of greens

* Hotdog weiners (boiled, fried, or BBQed - or hell, even microwaved) on a bed of greens (Caution: some hotdogs arent keto friendly. In general the better quality ones have the least carbs. I like the ones stuffed with cheese ^.^ )

**Dinners**

* Taco salad. Cook some groundbeef, add taco seasoning, slice some veggies, and find some sourcream.

* Bun-less burgers. Cook (BBQ or frying pan) frozen burger patty(s), garnish, and wrap in lettuce (getting fastfood burgers with no bun and no ketchup works too if youre not at home)

* Frozen veggies (streamed, microwaved, or however they say to be cooked) and streaks (BBQed, or however), or any kind of meat.

* Chicken ceasar salad. Chicken (I use leftover boneless chicken breasts baked in the oven), lettuce, and ceasar dressing (store bought, or make your own).

**Dessert**

* A couple of berrys, or some cheese.....mostly just skip dessert in my opinion. Its more trouble and more carbs than its worth.

This might be TMI at first but trust me, it's not what it seems.

So I was walking around today, and I felt my crotch was a little bit cold, like I’d sat in something wet, so obviously I went to the bathroom for a sly trouser-mirror-check just in case.

But there was nothing, and I was really confused. 'Maybe it's just a really cold day and I'm wearing thin trousers', I thought. I walked around some more with my friends, and my size 6 friend (who wears skirts all the time) said “argh, this stupid crazy wind is making it feel like I’ve wet myself.”

*...What?* 

After asking what she meant, she said “the wind’s going through the tops of my thighs and making it feel weird, like I’ve wet myself.” Then she laughed.

And then.... it hit me.

There is air. Between my thighs. At the top. PROPER SPACE BETWEEN THE TOPS OF MY THIGHS. THAT’S WHY IT FELT COLD.

I have a teeny tiny miniscule but still there thigh gap.

THIGH GAP. THIGH. GAP.

Guys- I'm a pear of epic proportions. There's a 5 inch difference between my bust/hip measurements. I have HUGE thighs/hips. I didn't even think a thigh gap, for me, was possible. My legs barely touch when I walk any more.

This is the 2nd to last thing on my weightloss checklist, the last being a stomach flat enough so you can properly see my abs (they're there when you poke my stomach, and I have ""fl-abs"" which is basically a cute little layer of fat in the shape of a six pack)-- but then I'll be DONE. The finish line has NEVER been this close.

Now if you'll kindly excuse me, I think I'm going to go strut my thigh gap into the gym.

Deciding to repost to help out the new folks who have come here after the New Year. Welcome, and I hope this helps you learn more about Keto.***

Howdy.

I've been a regular subber of /r/Keto and other related subreddits for a while now, and I notice the same kind of questions/posts coming up day after day. You've probably noticed this too.

Here's how you can utilize Reddit functions to get the best out of r/Keto:


1) **Read the FAQ!**

This one is simple. Don't just know it's there: go on and read it. Today. The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq) is a nicely organized source of information put together by mods and users here in r/Keto. In the FAQ, you will find:

* a [tl;dr](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#toc_2) of the Ketogenic diet basics
* Further information about [what may/may not be eaten](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#toc_3)
* (My favorite) A fantastic list of [resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#toc_59) to help you find answers to your keto-based questions.
* A ton more information you won't know unless you read it


2) **The Search Function**

If your question has not been answered by the FAQ, do not fear! Chances are, it's been asked before and answered before. You can utilize Reddit's search function to find these threads.

*Question: What are your favorite Thanksgiving recipes?*

We will conduct a few searches confined to r/Keto using keywords. [Here's how to](http://i.imgur.com/VPE1h.png).

* Keyword search: [Thanksgiving](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=Thanksgiving&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- This shows 160 threads pertaining to Thanksgiving.

* Keyword search: [Pumpkin pie](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=pumpkin+pie&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 30 threads relating to Pumpkin and Pumpkin pie.

* Keyword search: [Turkey](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=turkey&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 440 results all about turkey.

* Also try the FAQ's list of [common r/Keto searches](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#toc_68)

3) **Top Posts** (Motivation!)

I like to browse the top posts in r/Keto here from time to time, not for information, but for *motivation*. (If you don't know how, look [here](http://i.imgur.com/HVKLl.png) for a how-to or go straight to the [top posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/top/)). The top posts here are highly upvoted before/after transformations from our own users.

I personally find these a billion times more motivating than posting and asking folks here to motivate me. You have to seek your own motivation--no one here can talk it into you. I personally find motivation in the accomplishments of others, and r/Keto has plenty of success stories.

Spend some time looking through the photos and reading the stories of our users who have lost weight and changed their lives eating Ketogenically. (Is that a word? I'm going with yes.) 


4) **The Seester Subs**

Keto has plenty of other related subs that may help you in what you're looking for. Don't eat meat? Try /r/VegetarianKeto. Want to share and find great keto recipes? Try /r/KetoRecipes. The full list can be found on the right sidebar. Speaking of sidebar...

Edit:

* [All the keto-related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto+ketorecipes+ketocirclejerk+xxketo+ketorage+vegetarianketo+ketogains+ketodeals+ketomeatup+ketosnackexchange+theketodiet) *without r/ketogonewild*
* [All the keto-related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto+ketorecipes+ketocirclejerk+xxketo+ketorage+vegetarianketo+ketogains+ketodeals+ketomeatup+ketosnackexchange+ketogonewild+theketodiet) *including r/ketogonewild* **NSFW**
* Language/location-specific subreddits in sidebar


5) **The Sidebar**

The sidebar is full of links that may not otherwise be found in the FAQ. Go ahead and scroll on down. You'll see:

* The list of sister subs
* Some general Meta info on posting in r/Keto (also heed!)
* The Useful Links section full of, well, useful links
* Sites that r/Keto members have made
* Post Tags (these can be searched for and help keep the sub neat)
* The Moderators

**Using these resources before posting questions help keep the subreddit nice and neat, open you to a wealth of information, and may even get your questions answered immediately.** We have a really great sub here that tends to get cluttered with the same questions day after day. I hope this helps you learn to get the most out of r/Keto!

*Happy Ketoing!*

**Edit:** Sorry about links not working, it looks like the FAQ was changed a bit between the last post and this one. All links are functional now. Also added /r/TheKetoDiet to the list of subs.

**Edit 2:** It seems like this post has sparked some debate, some heated. Firstly let me say that I have no problem with questions, and neither does 99% of this sub! I love /r/Keto because it's a supporting community full of folks sharing information to help each other achieve their goals. Asking questions helps us all learn more and understand concepts more clearly. The intention of this post was to provide everyone with more tools to gain information and get more out of the sub. **In no way did I mean to imply that asking questions was a bad thing. It is very much a good thing, and I encourage you to ask anything and everything!** I often see the same questions posted daily (""Anyone on MFP?"", ""Can I eat X food?"", etc) and those questions are answered often. There is a MFP thread with names added daily, and plenty of resources listed in the FAQ to find out what foods are ""acceptable"" on Keto.

1374681371.0,410,self.keto,1iyndo,"Welcome to Keto, some things to remember",517,107,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iyndo/welcome_to_keto_some_things_to_remember/,"In my time here at /r/keto I've noticed things tend to go in waves. There are certain trends that happen, and certain misinformation that gets tossed around a lot. At the same time, there are things we often take for granted that everyone knows, when really we generally all start off pretty clueless. Here's some things that have helped me over the last two years

* keto is not a magic bullet. For most healthy people, keto doesn't work any better than calorie counting, with perhaps a slight advantage of keeping people feeling full longer and making it easier to eat less. For people with metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, hormone imbalances, PCOS, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and other health issues, keto can have other benefits, but the weight loss isn't magic. 

* It's normal and healthy to lose 1-2lbs a week, unless you are morbidly obese. And keep in mind that's an average - a few weeks here and there with no loss is also normal. If you are morbidly obese it's fair to expect/experience quicker weight loss, but it will slow down as you keep going. 

* ""Stalls"" are normal. It takes time for your body to adjust to weight loss, stalls happen to pretty much everyone, even if the math says they shouldn't. Biology works like biology, not like mathematics. Sometimes people lose in [wooshes](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/of-whooshes-and-squishy-fat.html), sometimes people lose more steadily. Hormones, sleep, diet, water retention, stress all play a factor. If you're at the same weight for more than 3 weeks and no other changes (like measurements) are happening, we can trouble shoot your diet. If it's just been a few days, keep calm and keto on. 

* water retention happens. Diet, stress, sleep, activity, hormones and a host of other things can affect how much water you've got. 3-10lbs fluctuation is within a normal range. So if you lost 2lbs of fat but are holding on to 4lbs of water, the scale won't move. Keep calm and keto on, and start taking measurements. 

* protein is not the enemy. While there is some debate over how much protein you need, it is an essential nutrient. If you are not getting enough, you will lose lean mass (which leads to ""skinny fat"" - high body fat percentage even at a ""normal"" weight). Yes, too much protein can be a problem, but too much is a whole lot of protein. Follow the guidelines in the keto calculator, you'll be fine. 

* Diet makes you lose weight, exercise makes you look better. It helps with the losing weight too ([especially lifting](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/02/01/what-burns-more-calories-cardio-intervals-or-weight-training/)), but you will never be able to outrun your fork. Eating back all the calories you burn after a workout is counter productive. Don't exercise yourself to ridiculous (netting 0 calories on a regular basis probably isn't wise), take care of your body. If you're unsure of where to start, talk with your doctor. If you have physical conditions, talk to a physiotherapist or a trainer. 

* Freestyle keto (not tracking) is possible, but you need to be smart about it. If you can't eat when hungry and stop when you're not, if you're unsure about portion sizes, if you eat for any reason other than being hungry, or if you aren't losing as much weight as you think you should, track your food. I'm not saying calories in/calories out is a perfect formula (because it's not, biology works like biology, not like math), but it is easier for your body to use dietary energy than it is to use stored fat, so if you're getting all the energy you need from what you eat, you will generally not be losing fat.

I went to the doctor two days ago for a follow-up to my original check-up after losing nearly twenty pounds. I've now lost just over 40lbs, and my doctor was quite happy. We did a lipids test, and I was BEYOND happy with the results that came in today:

 | 5 Feb 2013 | 6 May 2013
:--|:--:|:--:
**Weight** | 235 | 214
**Blood Pressure** | 164/74 | 122/78
**Total Cholesterol** | 228 | 185
**HDL** | 32 | 47
**LDL** | 182 | 126
**Chol/HDL Ratio** | 7.1 | 3.9

I nearly screamed in excitement when I saw these numbers. I couldn't believe how much they had changed from a good diet and exercise! Although I ended up cancelling my follow-up appointment with my dietitian, I now plan on forwarding these results to her, in the hopes that she realizes just how well this diet can work.

Some Background:

-I am a long-time (~3 year) redditor who mostly lurked by had decent karma on my old /u/.

-I started Keto after seeing a r/keto post cross-listed somewhere else and was AMAZED at what I saw on r/keto. I felt ""this is exactly what I have been looking for! this is a way that I can make the big weight loss change I know I want to do, but without being miserable for months or years on end! I thought HOW DID I NEVER KNOW OF THIS BEFORE?!

-The reason I had never seen it is simply that nobody seems to talk about or be supportive of the Ketogenic Diet. Sure Adkins and South Beach are popular and people all know that some people do a ""low carb"" diet. But when I explain Keto to people they think I'm crazy, and that I am going to drop dead of a heart attack.

-Getting a delicious cookbook to the public will show the world (and all your worried parents, friends, and SOs) that this isn't some crazy and dangerous fad diet...this is an alternative way of eating and using your body that for many people is an easy and enjoyable bath towards a happier, healthier, thinner, life.

-I have only been doing keto a week but I am always full, feel healthier, and have already lost 10.5 pounds (I know this is mostly glycogen water weight). So, I want to be in this for the long run, and even after just a week, I feel that the food (as I don't have a lot of money to spend on non-bulk and expensive items) is getting repetitive.

-Before Keto, one of my great passions was gourmet cooking. Seems like many here on r/keto are quite skilled in the kitchen as well.

-THere are already tons of delicious recipes on r/ketorecipes.

-SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PULL THESE RECIPES TOGETHER, ADD SOME NEW ONES, AND COMPLETE A COMPLETE COOKBOOK FOR KETOGENIC EATERS THAT COVERS:
-Everyday Breakfasts
-Everyday Lunches
-Everyday Dinners
-Everyday Snacks
-Special Desserts (Birthday Cake, Cheesecake, Ice Cream)
-A Keto Thanksgiving Meal
-A Keto Christmas Ham Dinner
-A Keto Passover Sedar (oy)
-We can consider more as we go on

-So...if you are interested, reply on the thread! This could be really cool! 

Feel free to PM me ONLY about:
-The Keto Cookbook
-Keto Recipes
-Showing me yoursel(f) naked

THanks guys! I really hope there are other people out there who think this is cool. Maybe I'm Crazy, if thats the case, feel free to let me know as well.

Feel free to get me On KetoChat, my handle is: Twisted

I started keto for the wrong reasons. I was angry. Angry at the world and not at myself. A broken misguided heart and a wallowing depression. My motivation was a Shakespearean quote ""Anger is my Meat, I sup upon myself and so shall starve in the feeding"" for the first few months of Keto.

I stumbled upon /R/keto via a random post on the front page, someones progress pics. followed by reading a post state ""A years going to pass whether or not you do anything about it"". and that hit me.

It started with a horrible stomach virus the weekend after discovering r/Keto. I spent the weekend in my shorts, taking nothing in but fluids. reading/pouring over the SideBar guides, watching documentaries about food and nutrition. planning. Figured a 3 day fast would be a great start, especially  using a stomach virus to help totally cleanse my system.

And so I started. I donated my entire pantry, potatoes, pasta, ramen, cookies, chips, everything. Donated it all and started totally fresh. Avoided anything with a carb in it. ended up relying on Sardines and farmers cheese for a go-to snack. 3 egg omlettes in the morning, with bacon, a salad with grilled chicken and Ken's Bleu Cheese dressing for lunch, a large piece of protein for dinner with broiled veggies in butter. 

I proudly admit that i've never cheated, never made a conscious choice to do something anti-Keto. I drank Vodka and Seltzer on occasion, cut out all soda, drank 2 gallons of water a day. and the weight came off.  I had a plan too. Every plateau hit, led to changing it up just slightly. enough to get me out of it. 

First was cutting out carbs completely. (&lt;20g / day)
next was following the ratios
followed by calorie counting (&lt;2500/day)
followed by Intermittent Fasting 

The intermittent fasting was the greatest challenge. I needed to break the bad habits I had accrued over the years, snacking, eating out of boredom, eating for the sake of eating because it was 8am, 12pm, 6pm. I needed to reteach myself. To eat when I was truly hungry. and I found it was easy once you got used to it. True hunger comes from the back of the jowls, not a grumbly tummy.  

I kept that up, I lost weight, grew a beard, and joined up with KetoChat. A wonderful support system can be found there if you talk to the right folks. My handle was 'Twisted' and I still head over there on occasion.

**I'd love to help anyone struggling, I know how hard it can be. And yes there are challenges to overcome and yes sometimes you just gotta muscle through it**. 


FYI: had my cholesterol checked and Blood pressure checked.

Cholesterol reads at 195, the technician didn't believe her equipment was working right when I told her what my diet consisted of, she claimed it should have been in the mid 200s. so she stuck me a second time and used a second machine. 195.

My blood pressure once read 190/115. its now 120/80 on the dot.

As a child I was always chubby. At the age of 11, having to be bed-ridden from severe illness (which my doctor prescribed lots of sugar to cope with) I put on a lot of weight. By the time I made it into Jr. High I was well over 200lbs. By early high school I was approaching 300. I managed to stay at around 350lbs for the next several years but, in my late 20's, I put on an extensive amount of weight, eventually reaching 465lbs.

My doctor at the time insisted that I get a gastric bypass. After a good amount of debate I finally capitulated. Following my bypass, the weight flew off of me. I managed to get down to 218lbs and could not seem to ever get any lower. No matter what I did, it seemed like 218 was where I was meant to be.

Over the past several years I'd managed to put on more weight, eventually getting up to 290lbs.

Another redditor posted an open invitation to his home in our hometown subreddit to smoke cigars and do some grilling. I'm not usually one to take advantage of an offer like that but I figured ""what the hell"" and took the drive. I noticed that the host, Jay (/u/Loudness), was eating his burger without a bun and asked him what was up with that. That's when I first learned about keto.

I looked into it for myself, did some research, and decided to give it a try. I was already determined to lose some weight and this seemed like something that might work (though it seemed really hard to believe that people were having such wonderful results).

That was in September of last year.

I went clothes shopping this past weekend and almost burst into tears. I tried on a pair of 36 jeans... and they fit. And it dawned on me, while I was having so much difficulty finding some shirts, that I was still shopping in the ""big guy"" section of the store. I walked into the other section (you know, the ""normal"" section) and that's when everything hit me. It was everything I could do to keep myself together.

I originally set a goal weight for myself of 215lbs (which I honestly thought unrealistic) and I'm only 2lbs away from meeting my goal. Once I get there (and I will) I'm going to set a new goal weight and see how far I can take this.

1358553735.0,396,self.keto,16ujle,6 months ago my doctor advised me not to do keto...,479,83,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/16ujle/6_months_ago_my_doctor_advised_me_not_to_do_keto/,"I'm about 6'0"" and was 204 lbs at the time. I'd heard about keto at the very end of June, and spent a week or two researching it. I was excited about the possibilities of the diet for a number of reasons (I've never really dieted before, because I hate normal ""diet food""), but my wife was very skeptical of what I was telling her. We're pretty big on fruit, and she thought a diet without fruit could never be healthy. I agreed to see a doctor before starting the diet to make sure there was nothing I should be worried about.

A few days later, I'm sitting in front of my doctor explaining how I'd like to try a ketogenic diet to shed some weight and hopefully improve my body's inner workings. He was pretty adamant that the best way to do that was to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, exercise, and eat fewer calories. Basically the standard ""how to lose weight"" ideas. I tried explaining about some of the research I'd read regarding keto, but he dismissed it as a ""fad diet"" like Atkins, South Beach, etc. and advised me not to do it. He did agree to have me take a blood test to check my lipid profile and fasting glucose levels, then see him again in 6 months.

Skip ahead a couple days and my blood test results come in. My cholesterol is 266, triglycerides are 128, HDL is 40, and calculated LDL is 200. My tri/HDL ratio (which I learned here on /r/keto should ideally be 2 or lower to minimize heart attack risk) was 3.2. Overall, I'd say it looked pretty bad. This was somewhat deflating because I figured if I shared this information with my wife, she'd be even more against me trying a ketogenic diet out. Now, I wouldn't say I **lied** to my wife about my doctor's advice nor my blood test results, but it's fair to say I diminished their significance when discussing them. In the end, we agreed that I'd try keto for a month and re-evaluate things then.

3 months later I was still doing keto. I'd lost 30 lbs and was feeling pretty darn great. A month or so into the diet I'd also figured out how to work in two or three 1-hour gym sessions a week, and that seemed to be paying dividends as well (feeling stronger, getting better muscle tone, etc). I emailed my doctor and explained to him that I had lost a fair amount of weight since my visit 3 months ago, and I'd like to get a blood test before the 6 month mark to make sure my diet wasn't adversely affecting my body internally. He ordered one, and a few days later I found that not only had I lost weight, but my cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and fasting glucose levels had all dropped pretty significantly! Encouraged by this, I decide to stick with keto and see where it takes me.

I hit the 6 month mark with keto around January 11, a day after I got the blood test that my doctor had asked me to get back in July. Suffice to say, [the results have been exciting](http://i.imgur.com/VO87iGl.jpg)! Not only do I [look a lot better](http://i.imgur.com/LtmFO.jpg), but I feel better and I have to believe that I'm at much lower risk of heart attack and type 2 diabetes. A couple of days ago I had my follow-up appointment with the doctor and got nothing but ""atta boys"" from him. He didn't ask me for specifics about how I lost the weight, so I'm a bit worried that he still thinks that a ketogenic diet is bad and will continue to warn other patients against it, so I'm considering emailing him to give him a little detail about my 6 month journey. Regardless, I'm happy to say that keto has worked out great for me, and I'm really glad that **in this particular case** I didn't listen to my doctor's advice.

Just wanted to share my story for a couple reasons. First, I hope it will help encourage those of you starting (or considering starting) keto. Second, because I know that my experience was enhanced greatly by you fine folks here at /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes and I want to thank you for your encouragement, information, recipes, etc.!",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_16ujle,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/16ujle/6_months_ago_my_doctor_advised_me_not_to_do_keto/,

One of the things I've been having a lot of problems with is eating out, especially when traveling for work. Since as a day job I am a web and mobile developer I think every problem can be solved with software. I'd like to present to you my latest small project, KetoFinder.

http://ketofinder.com/

Over the last week I've built out the website (which looks pretty good on mobile devices), and iOS app, and soon an Android app. The iOS will even cache the information. If you have an iPod Touch just go view your favorite places once and they'll be available when offline. Here are some screenshots of the iOS and Android app.

http://imgur.com/a/jM9JZ

The iOS app is almost done, but I will have to wait a bit to submit to Apple to ensure that it's not rejected for ""lack of functionality"" due to there not being a lot of food information yet.

Whats Next?
This was just a small fun project and experiment I wanted to try. The value in it depends heavily on the information available to everyone. If you think you'd find it useful for meeting your goals please contribute your favorite menu items and meals. To make it as easy as possible no user accounts are required to contribute, all items will be reviewed by an admin and approved before published. It's also worth noting that the webapp and the mobile apps will always be free.

My DR is kind of a hippy..  Any way I got on the scale and he was like.. ""14 lbs in three weeks?! My scale must be broken!"" he steps on it and then said ""nope its working fine""  I told him about keto and he said ""Oh I do that shit to man, I eat tons of meat"" 

So yeah.. 14 lbs in three weeks lifting weights once a week till failure and doing it with keto. as my hippy DR would say ""Fuck yeah man!""

**To recap:** 

Holee cow. Not only am I wearing a swimsuit...I'm wearing a swimsuit on the internet. I have r/keto, oven bacon, and my own vanity to thank; I couldn't have done it without you. :)

I'm a 5'11 female that has been eating Keto for the last 6 months or so. I was on a high-carb crazy train to deal with work and life stress. I stopped weighing myself at 185 so I'm not sure how heavy I was when I started with a keto diet. 

Within three months of keto I got down to my current weight of 158 or so. In early January I began light weightlifting and running. In early February I started Crossfit 2x per week. I eat about 30 grams of carbs a day and don't count calories. 

For the last three months I haven't really seen my weight change, but I've seen huge changes in my body and energy levels. [Here are some pics.](http://imgur.com/a/G5Jt0)

I've tried low carb diets before but was not nearly as successful as I've been after educating myself here at r/keto. I attribute my success largely to two things: 

1. In the past, I ate low carb, high protein. Becoming comfortable with eating fat has made all the difference. No more rabbit starvation and HEAVY CREAM FOR ALL MY FRIENDS. 
2. Almond flour! Flax meal! Stevia! Riced cauliflower!! Coconut oil!!! There are so many low-carb friendly foods that I didn't know about 5 years ago. They make cooking on keto interesting (and more importantly, delicous). 

**TL;DR Lost 30lbs, have a buttload more muscle and tons of energy. I'm stoked.**      




**Edit:** A few folks have asked if I have any advice for someone that's new to keto. Adding it here: 

There's a good chance you will feel HORRIBLE for a few days, if not a few weeks when you first start out. I'm very sensitive to sugar, and on the third day of no sugar, my keto flu was so extreme that I could hardly get out of bed, and I actually barfed in the shower. :(

Also, you may find that your physical performance is kinda miserable while your body adapts to burning fat. Have you ever had a dream where you're trying to run but you can't get your body to move (kinda like the air is thick like Jello...). Trying to work out while Keto adapting can feel a lot like that.

Oven bacon WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND as you get started. I just cover a baking sheet in tinfoil, lay some bacon on it, turn the oven on to 450 and put the pan in the oven. No need to preheat. Bacon is usually done in around 20 minutes depending on your oven temp and how thick the bacon is cut. I do this in the morning before I get in the shower, and then I have bacon waiting for me when I get out. It's pretty dreamy.

I'd also say don't get caught up in weighing yourself day to day. Your weight will fluctuate and it doesn't actually mean much. Find some really tight clothing, and some clothing that won't fit at all. Try it on once a week or so. This is a better gauge of the way your body is changing than watching numbers on a scale.

Finally, I think these websites may all be listed in the right-hand nav, but here are some of my favorites:

* [Linda's Low Carb Site](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/) -- This site looks really simple and kind of outdated, but it's got TONS of great recipes. She puts a star rating in the bottom of each recipe. It helps to pay attention to this. Sometimes she'll post recipes that aren't all that great to save you from finding them somewhere else and trying them yourself. Weird, I know.
* [I Breathe I'm Hungry](http://ibreatheimhungry.com/) -- This woman is super creative and posts delicious, original recipes. They're usually pretty simple to make, too. Try the faux mashed potatoes... they're wonderful.
* [Low-carb muffins (from Linda's low carb site)](http://xmasmuffins.blogspot.com/) -- These kept me sane when I first changed my diet. I love them SO MUCH. Be aware that they contain a lot of fiber and you may gain a little weight after eating them due to the bulk. Banana walnut are my favorite. Make these with a liquid sweetener to cut down on carbs. 
* [Cauliflower Pizza Crust](http://www.eat-drink-smile.com/2011/04/cauliflower-crust-pizza.html) -- Sounds weird, tastes wonderful. So many options with this. You can put alfredo sauce and artichoke hearts, pesto and sausage, make your own pizza sauce and add pepperonis and tons of veggies...

I started my journey nearly 4 and a half years ago.  I was always a fat kid, and I always told myself ""When I hit (275/300/325) pounds I would actually do something about it.

I started by eating breakfast everyday, cutting out liquid calories, and eating half as much as I used to.  Eventually I started counting calories.  In about 9 months I lost 115 pounds.  I had started to walk, bike, and even do a little weight training.

One day, I injured my back, and stopped almost all of my exercising.  For the next year and a half or so, I just put weight back on.  By NYE 2011, I was back up to 275.  I made a resolution to do something about it again in 2012.

And I did.  I tried the same weight loss strategy I had tried 3 years prior.  And I only lost 30 pounds.  It was disappointing.  I couldn't even get myself as low as I had previously.  I was also training for a Century.

Then I discovered this subreddit.  It was about a month before that 100 mile ride.  I decided I would start Keto the day after that ride.  Best decision I've ever made.

I've never felt so good.  Never had so much energy.  And the weight just fell away.  I was also fortunate.  Never had the keto-flu.  Never felt weaker.  I do often have to get more salt into my diet though ;)

You're great. You really are but ... please for the love of God stop posting your daily diary on this subreddit. I love updates(especially bloodwork), I live for the progress pics. What I can't stand is the need to give us your daily assessment of how keto is treating you. I know you're excited to lose that water weight. Hell, it's the thing that kept me going on this diet. But I beg of you, please stop doing the following.

Post 1: Day1: YAY I FINALLY DECIDED TO DO KETO! One question though how much fat am I supposed to eat? Can I just eat meat? Can I still eat this item(nutrition facts on label ignored)? Can I still eat sugar and bread? Essentially any question that can be answered by the FAQ or search option.

Post 2: Day2: Lunch... AM I DOING IT RIGHT!? (blurry pic of eggs and bacon)

Post 3: Day3: The stick just turned a different color, I'm IN KETOSIS!

Post 4: Day4: Does anyone else get really bad headaches on this? I feel really bad. someone help!

Post 5: Day7: THANKS FOR THE TIPS ABOUT SALTY BROTH, NO MORE KETOFLU! I'VE LOST 5 POUNDS OF FAT IN MY FIRST WEEK!

Post 6: Day 10: I really MISS CARBS, where can I find a substitute for mashed potatoes, indian food, pizza, pasta, etc...

Post 7: Day 14: I CHEATED! MAKE ME FEEL BETTER!

I beg of you newbies, there's no need to update us this much. Other newbies please chime in if you find those daily posts helpful and I will stop but for the love of God, your Day 2-4 updates are most certainly not necessary. Please give us your Month 2-4 updates instead.

Many thanks for those of you that have not taken this post personally. I love that you're changing yourself for the better. Please keep this subreddit filled with quality posts though and you'll find the much needed support you're looking for due to the fact that you kept the veteran ketoers from leaving.

I was a professional student forever and finally finished my Ph.D. Landed a great postdoc and I started to put on the pounds. Donuts everywhere, paid lunches, conferences with indulgent foods etc. I ballooned from 175 to about 245. I'm 6 foot, so this was certainly a big big change. I was solid all over, no gut, just became stocky. I knew I didnt want to 'diet' in the traditional sense. I didnt want to think about what to eat, or feel hungry while I'm concentrating on so many other things during my days. I stumbled across keto on reddit and then found the subforum. I gave it a shot, remembering this in biochem from my undergrad. Of course, I thought. I was reluctant about the cholesterol, but as I found out, my cholesterol was perfect well into keto. 

Initially, its weird to start out. I felt a little shitty the first day or two. Then it all changed. It. All. Fucking. Changed. No longer did I have stomach pains or unkind bm's. Lets talk real while we're here. About a month in I began to hear my face looked thinner, and my pants required a belt, unlike before. This first, noticeable change became this huge boost in the confidence I had for keto. Talk is talk, pictures are pictures, but until YOU experience that change, and realize YOU are going to effect your end result, you wont believe it. 

I began to subsidize the diet with exercise. By two months in I was down around 30 pounds. the more you see change, the harder you press, and I was loving it. About 4 months in I surpassed my goal weight of 175 and I am now at 170 and cut. I was never that person, I was in shape, but never cut. The only reason I'm here now is because this whole thing works. Its not some crazy pseudo-science. I despise that shit as a scientist, so I would never espouse that babble without the facts. 

But this, this shit is the legit method to burn off that fat and essentially, change your life. I never have stomach issues any longer, no problems with digestion. As an added aside not having all the sugars in my mouth changes the local environment, you'll see. Think of it as a surprise. 

I implore anyone, those wanting to shed a few for bikini season, to those at risk for disease brought on by weight gain to give this a real attempt. A month into it and you wont even be thinking youre on a diet. Just, oh a bagel? No thanks I'm fine. 

Happy baconing.

These are normally not an issue, but mine is exceptionally large (7.2 cm X 7.4 cm).  The oncologist referred me to a heptologist to make sure my liver was in good condition in case he needs to go in after this thing to remove it.  I soon started the keto diet to try to get in shape for what looks like inevitable surgery.

When the heptologist recommended that I lose weight (because insulin feeds tumors), I told him I had already lost 13 pounds.  He then said, well, I guess you don't need my diet speech.  I asked him for the short version.  His exact words were: carbs are bad and need to be almost cut from the diet.  He said he counsels patients to go Atkins at the very least.  When I told him I was doing keto, he didn't know what it was but told me I should keep on because it obviously worked.  

Anyway, although I usually keep to the ""first rule of keto,"" I think I will now tell people it's a diet my liver specialist recommended to shrink my tumor by dropping my insulin levels and working to reduce my insulin resistance (by dropping the weight).

I got MFP and started eating ""healthier"". Whole wheat sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and tracking my calories every day. I stayed under my calorie goal every day. I also joined a gym and worked out 5 days a week. I did about 20-30 minutes of cardio each day, and lifted weights for about an hour. 
I did this every day, I even did this while I went on vacation. 

I started my journey around 265 and by September, I was at 246. People had complimented me on my weight loss, but I wasn't happy. I didn't feel like I had been truly rewarded for all of my hard work.

I found out about keto and started on September 10. I don't have to tell you guys what happened next. 

I was adamant about tracking my weight every day so I could see what the weight loss looked like. 


[Here is that chart.](http://i.imgur.com/FObHT.jpg)


If you look at the chart, you will see how much my weight fluctuated while I was on a more ""recommended"" diet and workout plan. I have highlighted every time my weight spiked over my 10-day average weight. 12 times, to be exact. Once keto started, my 10-day average couldn't keep up with my weight loss. 

There were four spikes over the 10-day average and each one was some form of cheating days/weekends. In order: friend's bachelor party, Thanksgiving, friend's wedding, Christmas.

I truly believe there is no other diet out there that you can enjoy being on, and give you these kinds of results. I haven't hit my end goal yet, but I'm getting closer.

Thanks /r/keto. I owe this all to you guys.

After that was done, I went with the salesman to try on some new suits.  After measuring he sized me into a 44R jacket.  I tried some on and found a few cuts that fit me nicely right off the rack.  We then had them marked for tailoring (only needed the sleeves and pants hemmed...NICE!)

Calm down, young padawan. Keto is a journey. A long and tasty journey - the lifetime kind. One single error will not undo months or years of progress. It is the habit, not the exception, that matters.

Let's say you've been ketoing for a month. You've lost 5 or 10 or 20 pounds, you're feeling pretty good. Then one day someone is like ""Come over for dinner, we're having BBQ"" and you have way too many honey bbq wings which, when calculated, turns out to be 300g of carbs. You start to feel a little sick or hyper or sleepy and you realize your mistake. You're up all night with a stomach ache. You feel like you have the flu. Or maybe you just wake up and find you've gained a bunch of water weight.

So the next morning, you wake up, make yourself a spinach omelet or bacon and eggs or a low-carb protein shake with almond milk, and you keto on. You remember the carb meal fondly or distainfully, it doesn't matter, but you *do* remember that it was a one time thing that was an accident. You put it behind you. The water weight goes away in a matter of days, and you've lost none of your progress. You resume losing and you feel better again.


If you're doing keto because you're overweight, which a good number of us are, remember that you gained weight because you haven't been eating well for a very long time. You didn't go from 150 pounds to 300 pounds overnight, it snuck up on you, slowly. So slowly that you didn't think anything of it when your pant size crept up from an 8 to a 16 or a 34"" to a 46"". 

Losing weight is just the same in reverse. You won't lose 50 pounds overnight. You will lose what you need to over the course of months or years. A single day will be but a tiny drop in the bucket. It's a lifestyle. It's an everyday habit that gives you slow but noticeable results.

Just remember - keep calm and keto on.",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_rgxpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rgxpa/psa_one_carby_mistake_will_not_kill_you_its_just/,

I finally told her about keto/LCHF. I calmly explained the science behind it. The fact that cravings go away. Gave her some good resources. Even told her about the keto flu. And in that instant, she went from poli sci student to fully qualified nutritionist. 

Every shift after that was her berating me about my terrible decision. I was putting my family at risk because I was surely going to have a heart attack. Ill gain all the weight back. All that fat will catch up with me in ten years. Carbs are NEEDED, etc etc. Every. Single. Shift. 

I left that job about 11 months ago. Today I was on Facebook for the first time in months, and wouldn't you know it she is posting about the 4lbs of bacon she cooked up for the week.

This is just a friendly message from your moderators regarding our policy on cheat posts. You'll see over in the side bar that it very clearly says:

&gt;Posts related to cheating will not be tolerated. Posts considered to be ""low-effort"" will also be deleted.

(Go ahead and check, I'll wait)

So coming back from vacation and telling us about all the ~~delicious~~ horrible food you ate, or that you plan on going to a friends wedding and ~~binging~~ enjoying as much as you can is a bad idea. 

Yes, we all know in the grand scheme of things one meal/day/week/whatever doesn't really count and isn't going to make a huge difference. In that light, don't feel the need to tell us about it. You don't need to confess, you don't need to justify it, you don't need to tell us how much better you feel with/without cheat days. If you mess up and feel bad, then do better tomorrow. If you plan on eating whatever the hell you want on weekends, go ahead and do it. 

This forum is for talking about being on a ketogenic diet, not ways to *not* be on a ketogenic diet. We are not going to talk about the mental benefits of a planned cheat day, or how long it will take to get back into keto or how awful bread actually tastes when you haven't eaten it for a while. Sure, you might be able to handle it, but there are some here who can't, be respectful of that. 

Also, if you see a post that you feel doesn't belong in /r/keto, feel free to report it so the mods can take a look. We don't always read every thread/comment, so the reports help us keep things tidy. 

Finally, if you're sincerely looking for info about doing TKD or CKD in order to build strength/muscle while keeping your body fat low, please check out /r/ketogains, you'll find all the info you need. 


EDIT: the reasoning behind the ""no cheating posts""

&gt;since the idea of keto is to lose weight and gain control over insulin levels by restricting carbohydrates, creative/emotional/situational ways of eating carbohydrates goes against the purpose of the diet. We get a lot of new people asking about doing carb ups and cheat days/weekends/whatever because they think it is normal/allowed/the thing everyone does. It's not. For an obese person, having a cheat meal/day/weekend/whatever is counter productive to the purpose (regulating blood glucose) and goal (losing weight) of keto.


EDIT#2: to clarify

* ""Guys I'm going on a cruise, what can i expect/what can i eat/how did you do it"" is aok
* ""Guys it was my birthday and i had a huge cake and fries and all the thigns and now i'm back did you miss me"" is a no
* ""Is eating low carb torillas ok/worth it"" is a great topic
* ""I cheated and it was worth it and here's why it's ok"" is not

If eating carbs on vacation/special occasions/when your grandma makes you cokies is ok for you, that's all fine and dandy, but keep in mind that's not standard keto and not everyone has the ability to do that. The idea here isn't censorship or control, it's to keep all the posts/comments about how it's ok to have sugar/carbs/whatever and you're still keto to a bare minimum.

1370105684.0,347,self.keto,1fgyak,[Update] One full year on Keto. Some thoughts and how it affected my life.,419,72,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1fgyak/update_one_full_year_on_keto_some_thoughts_and/,"Greetings, Ketopians and lurkers. Today marks the anniversary of when I decided to turn my life around for good and to embark on the wonderful ketogenic lifestyle. Quite a lot of things have changed since then and I’d like to share a few points about before and after June 1st 2012. Passionate for the truth, delving deeper into science and medical journals, I am fully armed to defend this diet and its positive effects. 

[Before it all started. Shirtless and bulging.](http://imgur.com/zed9Njk)

Before the diet I was at a staggering 200 pounds (5’11). Now mind you that some here started at 300-400-500 pounds. It is a good display at how this diet works for a wide range of individuals, and how Metabolic Syndrome  by carbohydrates is the leading cause of weight gain in the West, arguably the world. Stuck on this paradigm that fat is fattening, that a calorie is a calorie and breakfast is vital to human health, the carbs came easy. How about a nice glass of orange juice for breakfast, followed by a piece of whole wheat bread with 100% fruit jam? Surely a responsible breakfast when following the rest of the crowd that babbles for human health. Well, if we modestly calculate the carb count we get over 60 grams of carbohydrates, unrefined, easily metabolized and nice wake up call to your pancreas. This is not a problem for the average individual if their paradigm favours the infallible laws of thermodynamics. Calorie wise, the breakfast suggested could be considered low calorie. And this is most likely why we are here; fat, desperate to find a way to shed off the pounds that have been accumulating over the years. We are ordinary people, doing ordinary things, always “watching” our calories, but the scale never binged downwards. 

After discovering this subreddit by the nice folks of r/loseit, I was automatically attracted to the conspiracy theorist level of bias and fallacies of the current diet proposed by the USDA and most Western countries, feasting on the literature being posted everyday with the very visual [Science] tag. So I jumped in, low-carb, high exercise ketoing. My goal was to lose 30 pounds in two months, and I lost 40. 
How did I do it?

[Some progress back in June-July 2012, Shirtless man incoming](http://i.imgur.com/Oz78A5S.jpg)

I set a strict 1500 calorie diet for the first month, always respecting my carb limit, and never cheated apart from one BLT 6 weeks in. I’d fast in the morning as long as possible, oft times accidentally fasting for the entire day. Diet sodas and sweeteners were allowed, to maintain my sanity after the sudden diet change. Coffee (2 cream) was a lifesaver, pushing my hunger pangs to much, much later. I did not suffer from a keto flu or maybe I just didn’t differentiate the horrible condition my digestive system was before the change. What I blamed on “lactose intolerance” was just not being healthy. Interestingly enough, my “intolerance” to lactose magically disappeared after those two months. Headaches are now rarities, early mornings less painful, and the general feeling of fatigue that I felt before the diet simply vanished.  

[Shirtless, now.](http://imgur.com/5z5oCz7)

I would run every two or three days, to the point where I managed to run steady 5k runs and went up to 12k one evening. This is when I finally concluded that running and ketoing are mutually compatible. Endurance is much more needed than spontaneous energy, and fat burning was extremely effective in giving me the endurance to run those extra kilometres. The ability to metabolize ketones at a speed fast enough to properly fuel your body during cardio exercise is possible. I believe I have achieved that stage. Jogging late at night and listening to music that motivates one to face the world made me feel so alive. It is well rewarding and I recommend anyone who is capable of running to do so. Although losing weight is 90% diet, exercise is a good component for self-improvement and general fitness. Without exercise, you might lose a lot of weight, but I can assure you that muscle can be lost on the ketogenic diet. So keep yourself busy. 

[Back from a run](http://imgur.com/UEkilZQ)

After losing forty pounds it was like being reborn. People don’t recognize you anymore; it’s like a brand new start. Going back to college and talking to old classmates who double-take when they see you feels great. The number of NSVs are uncountable and you get noticed by curious, attractive eyes, anywhere you go. Speaking of which, might I remind you the wonderful effects sexual hormones, uninhibited by insulin, manifests onto an individual’s life. The workouts are fiercer, taken as a challenge rather than a burden. Sex, to keep it relatively short, is amazing and the love of my life is very welcome at the idea of having more of it...when she gets back from England.
 
With a final college course on writing a 10-15 page paper on any subject of choice led me to write an essay on the leading causes of obesity in the western world. Gary Taubes was my main source and I had the privilege to read both of his books on nutrition, as well as reviewing countless scientific journals on nutrition and energy expenditure. I concluded that the genetic predisposition of an individual’s metabolic response towards carbohydrates is the leading cause of obesity, more specifically in ethnic minorities and Native Americans, but very much so with white Europeans.

My prof was very much interested. As an Irishman who ate potatoes all his life and seen the decline in physical labour, it was hard for him to fully grasp the idea but respected my proposition nonetheless. Before giving him the finalized copy of my work, he said something like this: “You have to watch out, for what you are proposing is that you have found the Holy Grail!” I did, sir. I did.  

One year has passed by and I have kept the same weight, but significantly gained more muscle. Being 20 years old, I still have a long way to go. At least I’ll start on the right track. 

[With my favourite human](http://i.imgur.com/PfsDH41.jpg)

And I am content.

Cheers, love you all.

Top 10 all-time Caveman keto recipes + progress pics inside!!!,404,63,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/16naai/sv_nsv_one_year_of_keto_down_60_lbs_lost_top_10/,"Well, its been a long ride. Like many others, I randomly came across the /r/keto subreddit while randomly browsing reddit.  I believe I clicked on a link via /r/loseit.  I had no idea what it was and I had never even heard of the diet.  I was intrigued by the bacon and my love of cooking bacon and combined with the extra fat of the holidays, I began to ponder the diet. After much research I finally convinced my wife we should try the diet.

Previously to /r/keto I was a reddit lurker so I started this account to interact with the community. I started by posting pictures of my food on imgur and one day someone asked if I had the recipes on a blog somewhere.  Being in grad school with a decent amount of free time, I started [Caveman Keto](http://cavemanketo.com) and the rest is history.

I ended up losing a total of 60 lbs over the course of the diet!  I've met a lot of cool people and hopefully helped others at the same time.

**Here are some NSVs:**

* Went from an XL to a medium
* Size 40 pants to 33/34
* Obese to normal BMI
* Did a 50 mile bike race
* Biked over 1000 miles since starting the diet
* No longer get winded walking to my office from the car
* Started browsing /r/malefashionadvice and totally reworked my wardrobe

And now the obligatory **Progress Pictures**: [Caveman Keto before and after the keto transformation](http://imgur.com/a/EgVdX)

I've taken other progress pics with more skin throughout the journey but I'm not sure I'm ready to post them yet. Also, since food and the blog have been such a large part of my journey, I'd like to present to you the top recipes of all time based on the number of visitors.

Thanks for all of the help /r/keto and here's to another year!  My goal by next year is to work on adding exercise and weight lifting to the mix to tone more.

This year I went from 274.8 to 220 - about 54 lbs. Not as much as last year, where most of my weight loss occurred, but still about 4 lbs a month average, so I won't complain! My waist size two years ago was something like 62 and my shirt/short size was 4x. I'm now down to a L shirt and 36/38 waist.

Common questions: 


**Do you have loose skin?** Yes, although the only place its really noticeable is in my crotch area. It's unavoidable with weight loss this dramatic. Just be sure to minimize it by not smoking and supplementing your omegas (Fish oil). other factors outside of your control are genetics (natural skin elasticity) and how long the skin has been stretched for (those obese for a long time will have worse extra skin). 


**Why are there spikes on your chart?** Holiday-related cheat meals (January is pretty self-explanatory, but my birthday is in August). As you can see I gain weight at an astronomical rate when I eat a lot of carbs. Some would argue this is mostly water, but it still delays my weight loss for a long period of time.

He was happy with my weight loss, and as far as keto went, he said he ""wasn't sure if it was a sustainable lifestyle, but weight loss is what's important."" All in all, I was comfortable with his opinion. He did, however, recommend I get a dietitian's opinion.

I went to see the dietitian today - let's just say things did not go as smoothly. I gave her a copy of my food log, and the moment she saw 51g of saturated fat, she started laughing and saying ""no, no, no."" I told her I didn't understand why I've lost nearly 30lbs in two months if what I'm doing is so bad.

This is where I really got mad. She told me because my cholesterol was in poor shape (which it is), the saturated fat was doing more harm than good. I tried to counter with bread also raises LDL, and she came back with ""did you ever see the movie Supersize Me?"" If you've watched Fat Head like I have, and done your research on carbs, this should piss you off as well.

In the end, it was an hour filled of total bullshit that I already knew and was against. She wants me to get 200g of carbs - I laughed at that. I'm going back to her in a couple months with new test results; I really want to prove to her this works. I've never faced so much opposition against keto before, and it sucks. All I know is that this diet is amazing, and it's working wonders for me.

I've been a regular subber of /r/Keto and other related subreddits for a while now, and I notice the same kind of questions/posts coming up day after day. You've probably noticed this too.

Here's how you can utilize Reddit functions to get the best out of r/Keto:


1) **Read the FAQ!**

This one is simple. Don't just know it's there: go on and read it. Today. The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto) is a nicely organized source of information put together by mods and users here in r/Keto. In the FAQ, you will find:

* a [tl;dr](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#TLDR) of the Ketogenic diet basics
* Further information about [what may/may not be eaten](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#TheStandardApproach)
* (My favorite) A fantastic list of [resources](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Resources) to help you find answers to your keto-based questions.
* A ton more information you won't know unless you read it


2) **The Search Function**

If your question has not been answered by the FAQ, do not fear! Chances are, it's been asked before and answered before. You can utilize Reddit's search function to find these threads.

*Question: What are your favorite Thanksgiving recipes?*

We will conduct a few searches confined to r/Keto using keywords. [Here's how to](http://i.imgur.com/VPE1h.png).

* Keyword search: [Thanksgiving](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=Thanksgiving&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- This shows 160 threads pertaining to Thanksgiving.

* Keyword search: [Pumpkin pie](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=pumpkin+pie&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 30 threads relating to Pumpkin and Pumpkin pie.

* Keyword search: [Turkey](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=turkey&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 440 results all about turkey.

* Also try the FAQ's list of [common r/Keto searches](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#CommonrketoSearches)

3) **Top Posts** (Motivation!)

I like to browse the top posts in r/Keto here from time to time, not for information, but for *motivation*. (If you don't know how, look [here](http://i.imgur.com/HVKLl.png) for a how-to or go straight to the [top posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/top/)). The top posts here are highly upvoted before/after transformations from our own users.

I personally find these a billion times more motivating than posting and asking folks here to motivate me. You have to seek your own motivation--no one here can talk it into you. I personally find motivation in the accomplishments of others, and r/Keto has plenty of success stories.

Spend some time looking through the photos and reading the stories of our users who have lost weight and changed their lives eating Ketogenically. (Is that a word? I'm going with yes.) 


4) **The Seester Subs**

Keto has plenty of other related subs that may help you in what you're looking for. Don't eat meat? Try /r/VegetarianKeto. Want to share and find great keto recipes? Try /r/KetoRecipes. The full list can be found on the right sidebar. Speaking of sidebar...

Edit:

* [All the keto-related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto+ketorecipes+ketocirclejerk+xxketo+ketorage+vegetarianketo+ketogains+ketodeals+ketomeatup+ketosnackexchange) *without r/ketogonewild*
* [All the keto-related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto+ketorecipes+ketocirclejerk+xxketo+ketorage+vegetarianketo+ketogains+ketodeals+ketomeatup+ketosnackexchange+ketogonewild) *including r/ketogonewild* **NSFW**
* Language/location-specific subreddits in sidebar


5) **The Sidebar**

The sidebar is full of links that may not otherwise be found in the FAQ. Go ahead and scroll on down. You'll see:

* The list of sister subs
* Some general Meta info on posting in r/Keto (also heed!)
* The Useful Links section full of, well, useful links
* Sites that r/Keto members have made
* Post Tags (these can be searched for and help keep the sub neat)
* The Moderators

**Using these resources before posting questions help keep the subreddit nice and neat, open you to a wealth of information, and may even get your questions answered immediately.** We have a really great sub here that tends to get cluttered with the same questions day after day. I hope this helps you learn to get the most out of r/Keto!

EDIT: Links to pictures removed for future security. Feel free to ask if you really want to see- I still have the links. 

People are asking me about food and what I did. Several of my recipes are found here in r/Keto if you look back about a year- who has time for that?! I'm a vegetarian- so this was all VegKeto.

Staple foods/weekly shopping:

Olives

Nuts

Kimchi

Pickles

String Cheese

Veggie Burgers

Heavy Cream

Eggs

Veggie breakfast meats


Recipes: These are not scientific- I am not good at quickly throwing down recipes- you can PM me if you want more detail.


Keto Cheese Soup (a recipe found on here that is someone else's idea but I can't find to credit): 1/2- 1 stick of butter melted in a pan with 1 cup of heavy cream. About 1 cup of cheese of choice (I used cheddar mostly). Melt it together until it becomes soup. For variation, sometimes I throw it in a blender with a couple cups of cooked broccoli.  This has a huge fat ratio... and tastes amazing. Don't overdo it (have it every day) or you will be sick.

Mashed Cauliflower: Head of cauliflower cooked and then blended with heavy cream and cheese- all to taste preference. Add spices of choice- I like cayenne. 

Fried Tofu: Craptons of butter in a skillet. Extra firm tofu sliced 1/2 inch thick or less. Fry tofu on medium until crispy and then flip. Take off pan and coat in buffalo sauce, then serve appropriate amounts of blue cheese dressing with it. Have some celery to make yourself not feel like a glutton. 

Peanut butter cheesecake mess: However much cream cheese you want mixed with a bit of splenda and vanilla extract (to taste). Slather peanut butter on top. Cram it in your face. 


Exercise: During the summer, because I felt like it, I rode my bike for about 20-30 miles twice a week. I would ride my bike three towns over in the summer heat and share half a small pizza with my SO. I cheated and worked at the same time. I don't advocate cheating- but don't kill yourself with exercise, you have to refuel somehow. 

Often, I would go indoor rock climbing for fun as well. Mostly, I didn't exercise for exercise though.

I'm 5""7 and went from 187 pounds to 155 in 3 and a half month.

I never really counted calories or anything like that. For breakfast I usually had some cheese or some cucumber slices with cream cheese on top and for lunch I went very light with just some cheese and maybe a small smoked 95%+ meat sausage.
After about 5-6 weeks I felt very little hunger during the day (despite me being a real muncher before doing keto) and often times skipped breakfast or lunch, effectively doing intermittant fasting without really caring about doing so.
One thing I must note is that I felt more energetic while doing keto than I've felt in many years before.

As for excercise I tried to take a detour to make my walk to the bus each morning a few extra miles, and that's it.

I got a lot of inspiration from this subreddit and I hope this can contribute somehow with some inspirations for food :)

Feel free to ask me about any recipes (or anything else) but I think most of the recipes are self explanatory just from the pictures, apart from some.

The yellow sauce you see on some of the pictures are either store bought bernaise sauce (1g carb per serving) or the following butter sauce:

* heavy cream
* butter
* lemon juice and chopped dill or parsely for fish OR very little lemon juice and ground pepper + what's on your mind for meat
* salt to taste

Reduce the cream to about 50-70% of it's original volume in a sauce pan, then add cold butter one tablespoon at the time, let it blend in while stirring and repeat until you got as much butter in it as you want (rough estimate: 1 cup cream should have 4-6 tablespoons of butter)

1366106121.0,335,self.keto,1cgb9t,I am a Keto failure: I gained back TWICE the amount of weight I lost. Some advice from a guy who loved Keto as well...,421,86,255,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1cgb9t/i_am_a_keto_failure_i_gained_back_twice_the/,"I think we can all agree that Keto is a lifestyle change and not a diet.

Please understand that I LOVED keto food too, lost a ton of weight, and felt great. But I just couldn't live the rest of my life (I'll say that again...'rest of my life') without a burger bun, a french fry, or potato chip. One french fry turned into two, then I found myself eating carbs and the same ratio as I was eating keto food before I knew it. On keto, I could eat a ton of veggies and meats which was great, but that 'portion mindset' transitioned over when I slowly relapsed. I gained it all back and tons more. 

I spent the last 7 months losing all the weight again through simple calorie counting. At one point I ate fast food for a month and lost 20lbs. But guess what? I still love and eat Keto food! I may not be in ketosis, but I still enjoy all the delicious dishes it has to offer.

Why I failed:

The simple mindset of feeling restricted from certain foods was what caused me to relapse after the initial excitement (6 months in) wore off. Now that I have learned to properly manage my calories, I can still enjoy keto food but not feel restricted at all. This is what became so mentally taxing after a while; That feeling of 'this food is off limits forever'.

It is so often stated around here that calorie counting can be ignored, but I STRONGLY suggest they should go hand in hand just so you have an idea of what you are putting into your body to properly manage a relapse. Think 6 months, 1 year, or 10 years down the road.

1373348450.0,329,self.keto,1hx2rw,[NSV] How Keto Is Saving My Family,391,62,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1hx2rw/nsv_how_keto_is_saving_my_family/,"It started as an experiment: how could I lose enough weight to exercise comfortably without sacrificing my love to cook, and my equal love of eating? It seems as though I had gone through every option and failed... No soda, no sweets, vegetarian diet, even going full-on vegan, and I could never see a result worth the struggle. I was browsing reddit when I came across the word 'keto'. I did some research and started my journey in early March of this year. 



From my heaviest, I've lost a solid 50 pounds (200+, I stopped weighing myself after a while due to the shame, now down to 155). I've never felt more secure and confident in my body and everything it is capable of. Yoga, hiking, running, swimming, dancing; I love the feeling of my body in motion without the extra strain once attached to it. My family in friends who haven't seen me in a few months consistently have the same reaction: ""You look amazing, how did you do it?""



The past two months, however, have been hard on my family. We received news that my father has prostate cancer. His doctor went to great lengths to emphasize that he needed to lose as much weight as possible for the upcoming surgeries. He's been so positive about the treatments, it's inspirational, but when it came to changing his diet, he was upset to say the least. My former Navy Lieutenant Commander, 6-inch-long-grey-beard-wearing, Harley-riding father was going to have to stop the boozing and barbecuing that made his motorcycle club meetings feel like family dinners. My dad and I had a distant relationship at best, he being strict and logical where I was creative and spontaneous, but I decided to offer some advice. Keto had worked for me, so why not give it a try? I explained that he didn't have to calorie count unless he really wanted to, and meat and cheese were free game. He was skeptical, but agreed to try it for a week, as long as I cooked. 



He's been on keto with me ever since. The first week's worth of meals impressed him so much, he said it felt like he was getting three restaurant-quality meals made for him every day. I'd cook and stock the fridge with only keto-friendly foods to help him avoid temptation, and he'd clean the kitchen and wash dishes in return (my two least favorite chores... So a definite win-win!) Not only am I cooking every day, my dad and I started eating together... AT A DINNER TABLE. After a whole lifetime of sitting by myself in front of the TV while I ate dinner, it was so amazing to enjoy a conversation and really take in the effort of my labor instead of mindlessly shoving food in my mouth alone. My dad doesn't talk about the pain from the procedures and the surgeries, but he does talk about just about everything else. I get to hear his views on politics and science, things he doesn't share with his club brothers or my mom. We talk about our jobs and music-- I never thought an engineer who loves classic rock and a waitress who loves EDM could relate so well. After dinner, we watch movies and play guitar together. Right now we're learning Put Your Lights On by Santana, one of his favorite songs of all time.



My mom and sister are a bit more reserved than my father and I, but even they are coming around and joining us at dinner. It feels good to sit at the table with them and hear about their days. My mom says eating in every night is saving money, something that stressed both of my parents out for a long time. My kid sister is choosing to stay in for our after-dinner movies instead of staying out late with friends.



Dad's lost about 25 pounds since he started, getting closer by the day to his goal of 200lbs. Once he hits that, we're going to try exercise too. I remember my dad waking up at 5 a.m. for his morning runs when I was little, but this time, I'll be waking up with him. I know this is only the beginning of the journey for my dad and the rest of the family, but I'd say we're off to a pretty good start.",,False,self,t5_2rske,1373421958.0,,,True,t3_1hx2rw,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1hx2rw/nsv_how_keto_is_saving_my_family/,

I have struggled with my weight for years, and around thanksgiving of 2011, I decided I'd had enough.  I weighed myself at my heaviest at 251, and said to myself, ""that's too much.""  I poked around at diets, and settled on Keto, because it seemed to fit with what I liked to eat, and what I could give up.  And the weight started to come off.

It was hard to stick to sometimes, but I weighed myself every day and kept losing weight.  I found it pretty easy to stay motivated, and to link my behavior to my weight, because every day I would wake up, weigh myself, and know if what I did yesterday was good, or if I screwed up.  For the first few months, all I had to to was change what I ate, and weight loss just seemed to happen.  Then I started to hit plateaus, and began to count calories, and weight started coming off again; slowly, but steadily.

I started running.  I was terrible at it (I still am), but I'm actually starting to know what ""healthy"" feels like.  

I went from an XL to a Small or Medium in shirts, and from a 38 to a 32 in pants.  I've given almost my entire wardrobe to goodwill.

The first picture is from a backpacking trip I took with my sister.  I was horrendously out of shape for it, and was close to my heaviest weight.  The second picture is from a few days ago, when I realized just how far I'd come, and wanted to share.

- i have dropped 40 pounds from my all-time high.

- i sized down from from a 12/14 to a 6/8.

- i lost a cup size. D:

- i went down a shoe size.

- i got laid! by pretty good-looking dudes, i might add. i still don't feel fully sexually attractive, but whatever. doesn't matter; had sex.

- i feel confident enough to go out more often. no more nights sitting alone in my room, playing skyrim and listening to audiobooks about the nazi regime!

- i made my little asian mother cry with pride (and possibly relief). she has now made it her personal mission to buy me lots of new clothes now that i'm no longer creeping towards plus sizes.

- i cook less than i ever have before, which is a bit odd. but part of that is due to how often i skip meals. typically, i forget to eat dinner because i get busy and i'm never hungry.

- the staff at jimmy john's know me on sight. every time i walk in during lunch, someone yells 
MIMIIIIII! UNNNNWIIIIIIIIICH!""

- i also eat at wingstop far more than i'd like to admit. people tell me i'm going to become massive if i continue to devour chicken wings like i'm a middle-aged man watching football in my living room. but i keep getting smaller, so pretty much fuck that notion forever.

- i have converted at least 3 people to the keto lifestyle. am i a ketovangelist now?

- i let people take full-body photos of me without being filled with self-loathing and paranoia.

- i have gained a new appreciation for certain foods i did not used to like: spinach, dark chocolate, almonds. now i love them reverently.

and most importantly, i think:

- i no longer refer to myself as a fat girl.

this subreddit has (with absolutely no exaggeration) changed my life and my relationship with food. i was so ridiculously skeptical the first time i came across keto, but letting myself be open to the idea of LCHF has been the best thing i've ever done for my self-esteem. group hug, please.

It's come to that time again when we're faced with a massive influx of new users with their regurgitated broscience, anecdotal paradoxes and non-conformance. Although the majority of /r/keto content is rich and worthy, there's in increasing number of posts completely void of relevancy or usefulness. To keep this place clean and helpful, please note the following and report all posts which don't adhere to these simple rules for keeping the content relevant: 

**Cheating**  
Please don't enable cheating. This issue has arisen before and the general consensus is that you don't bring a flask of Jack Daniels to an AA meeting. Similarly, please don't look for approval to cheat or belittle the seriousness of a personal slip-up. If you're not 'doing keto' and you're just being negative about your own failed interpretation of the approach then you aren't contributing - you're clogging the place up with negativity. Your motivation should be intrinsic, you're doing this for you and /r/keto isn't a place to come crying to when you've folded because you like cake. Carb-ups are not the same as cheating and discussion of the beneficial applications of carb loading is entirely welcome. So, please, no more ""I ate 3 loaves of bread and I feel awful!"" or ""I'm going to cheat, someone help me because I don't have the discipline to!"" - it detracts from the spirit of this sub-reddit and clogs up the place with whining and negative failure.

**Slanderous Posts**  
Unless there is relevant scientific content contained within, please refrain from posting snotty articles about the absurdity other methods and approaches. It offers nothing.

**Post Tags / Titles**  
Please remember to post your tags correctly using the appropriate tags from the sidebar - they make posts easier to identify and find at a later date. If you could also use memorable, concise titles for your posts - it makes them easier to find too.

**Upvoting and Downvoting**  
It's tough, but please try to avoid upvoting things on a knee-jerk, ""that's funny because it's true"" reaction. It prevents real content from hitting the front page. Example of what I mean: The top post just now is a picture of the USDA food pyramid and how silly it is. Everyone here knows that. If they didn't know that, they didn't read the fucking FAQ. Meanwhile [this open question](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rqz0l/ideas_for_not_regaining_all_the_weight/) about keto and regaining of weight has 10 points and will barely be seen. Think ""would people actually benefit from seeing this""? If so, upvote, please.

**Memes**  
Please posts rage comics and the like to /r/ketorage - that's why it's there.

I've talked with a few regulars and a couple of other mods about whether or not this should actually be posted and we all agreed it was for the best. This is an awesome community - one of the best on Reddit IMO - and we need to keep it that way or it just becomes a shitty, cluttered circlejerk.

If you haven't made them, hopefully this shows you how!  Have a recipe you like that you want me to post? Let me know below with a comment.

I fire him. ,365,46,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/zgk3g/sv_its_official_ive_lost_100_pounds_doctor_freaks/,"Went to the Dr today for a checkup. Haven't been in his office since last Halloween. According to his paperwork, I weighed in at 427 pounds. I remember the cold feeling in the pit of my stomach when that happened. And the embarrassment of having to go upstairs to the ""special heavy duty scale"" to get weighed. 

When I arrived today, the nurse tried to take me up there, and I politely insisted that they weigh me on a regular scale. She did. Then she had me step off and back on again. Then she took me to another scale. Then we went upstairs. On every single one of them...327 lbs, 

Back to the examining room. Doctor enters, tells me to step on the scale, and we do it again. Then...he starts grilling me. 

He does nothing but shake his head and tut at me when I explain what I've been doing, and he asks me more than one if I'm taking something either over the counter, or illicit. Then comes the lecture about what a dangerous fad diet the whole low-carb thing is. 

I stop him halfway through and ask him why he's lecturing me without having any bloodwork to look at. He gets irritated. I stand up and tell him that he's fired, and that I'll be finding a new physician. 

Made some calls, got hooked up with a new doc that's keto-friendly, and set up for an appointment next week. 

TLDR: Haters gonna hate, even doctors. Fire them, move on and continue to win. 

EDIT: Thank you all so very much for your support. This is a fantastic community, and it's really, really helped me in many ways. From the recipes and food porn, to the science talk it's been great.

However I made a crucial mistake, after a week of omelets and bacon I decided to scoff an Atkins Daybreak breakfast bar, no problem I thought. Then time simply slipped away. 

Before I knew it I found myself in the early afternoon on nothing but that breakfast bar. No fat, no fibre, no protein. Now at this point Keto had been going well, I was pissing like a racehorse and drinking like a fish. My strips couldn't get any more purple, my energy is abundant and pounds are starting to slip off however I was completely unprepared for what happened next. I began feeling strangely lightheaded and disorientated, I wasn't exactly hungry but I instinctively knew I had to eat and eat fast. Cue a frantic dash back to the car loading up the spoils of the grocery war and then the surreal moment itself. With my horrified wife in the seat beside me and my baby son sleeping in the back I preceded to eat a full rotisserie chicken with my bare hands.

Letting each piece of skin and flesh melt in my mouth as the fat ran down my cheeks I was the poster boy for gluttony and like a barbarian warrior feasting on the spoils of war I was filled with both a sense of achievement and shame for what I had done. For a few raging minutes of savagery the manners instilled in me by my dear mother were cast aside as I tore the carcass asunder.

I can honestly say following that frantic feeding session, I have never felt so good, it was as if my body was buzzing on endorphins and adrenaline as the fat and protein reached my gut.

Here I am, 57 lbs lighter than when I started. It looks like someone deflated me! (Pardon the censoring ... heh.) This is more skin than I've ever shown on the internet, but ... what the hell. I'm proud of my accomplishment.

[Bonus shot of me holding my little buddy](http://i.imgur.com/d5xqdyY.jpg), who weighs about as much as I lost. He wasn't happy with this shot.

I knew I lost weight -- I saw it in my clothes (which failed to fit), but it still took awhile for me to really accept that I wasn't the same guy I was when I started. That realization came when I stood up and my shorts, which normally my fat held up, just dropped. I went from a size 40 waist to 34, an XL to a medium in shirts, and a neck size of 17.5 to 16. Here's [a before/after shot](http://i.imgur.com/iLOgYc3.jpg) I posted a little while ago, showing my absolute fattest a month before starting the diet last year.

These days I've been pretty lax on logging, but I've maintained the diet and am dropping slowly. My goal has been 185, to get to the weight I was when I graduated high school 15 years ago, and I'm pretty darn close! I think I can stand to lose another 15 or so, though, so as soon as I hit this goal I'll be shooting for another.

I'm getting married in October. While I'd love to hit 170 by then, I'm in no rush. More important than hitting goals is being healthy and eating healthy (get them fresh veggies!), and I feel awesome just doing that. Those of you just starting, don't let the numbers or dates hold you up. Just stick to it and enjoy life. 

Thanks to everyone here and in the other various keto subs for all the support, help, information, and inspiration. And cheers to all my buds at MyFitnessPal. If you want to add me I'm also big_onion there.

Like, do you REALLY like jerky?
Think of your favorite store brand of jerky. Jack Links... Wild Bills, Slim Jim.. Mmmmmmmm salty, chewy goodness..

NO. Spit that shit out. Look at the back of that package. Look at all those chemicals. And look at that beef!! its soo.. BLECH. 
IT'S SOYLENT GREEN!!! (Ok, I admit, I will eat it too from time to time) 

Now, do you want to know the easy way to make some bad ass.... make-your-mouth-water and 30-cats-stand-at-your-door-when-they-smell-it jerky?

Read on..
if not.. go enjoy your nasty overpriced meat chips. Be careful to not choke on the ""do not eat"" packet they hide in there. Yes, they ARE trying to kill you.

First thing you need to do.

Call your local butcher, or meat department of your favorite grocery store. 

Tell them you need 5 lbs. (you can do less. 5 lbs is a decent amount and not too much) of lean roast for jerky. If they ask you what kind, tell them rump roast, top round, or flank. Just make sure it is lean. Why? I know.. we love fat on keto. Sometimes it is inevitable and there will be fat in your cut. It's ok. But here is the thing. Fat in jerky makes it go rancid. When I get fatty pieces I keep those in the fridge, and eat them first. And also to be honest, I think they are really really tasty morsels. 

Anyway, these meats... need to be NO MORE than 1/4'' thick. Any length is fine, and with as well. Just tell them you are making jerky and they should oblige. And this shouldn't cost extra. 

Ok, so when you go to the butcher or wherever and get your meat, we have to grab our supplies.

This is for 5 lbs.... 

6 tablespoons of onion powder.
3 cups Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup soy sauce (more if you like it salty)
3/4 of a packet of dry italian dressing mix
Garlic powder, pepper to taste.


Now, when you get home. Crack open a low carb beer. Labatt 52 is my choice. 1.9g carbs per bottle. Now, take that sliced meat, all that marinade and throw it in a gallon zip lock bag. Sip that beer as you do this to assert your manhood in jerky making. Feel free to mix up the ratios to your liking. I will make the marinade separate and dip my finger in that shit to taste test. Then go nuts with a straw like a newly dumped frat girl on a pint of Ben and Jerry's

Anyway. Throw that in the fridge for 24 hours MINIMUM..

Also don't forget to occasionally during the time to swish things around in the bag so everything gets all nice and marinated. No swishing means jerky with dull, no flavor spots. Dont fuck this up for us. We have a lot riding on this you know.

Ok, so 24 hours later, after a shitty day at work, you're ready to call in sick because, well ... fuck responsibility right? Besides, we need this time to babysit our meat curtains. 

So, let's get the oven ready. Im not going to type out a paragraph on how to do this but basically, take your meat.. and do [this](http://imgur.com/cWGGn) See how I took the bottom rack and lined it with tin foil? that catches the drippings. Also, dont ring the meat out like a washcloth, but try to get as much of the moisture off as possible. I like to run the meat between two fingers before I put it on the rack. And yes, I know.. I have to clean my oven. Everytime I put it on the clean setting it smokes like a chimney and I have to abort the cleaning cycle like an out of wedlock fetus.

Shit, that was just a paragraph, wasn't it?

Anyway. Now, slide those racks into the oven BUT DONT CLOSE IT!! 

We want to leave that door open 1/8th of the way I prop mine open with a can of beans. Why? Well, for our nice aroma to fill the house, and how else are you going to summon 30 neighborhood cats?  (really, it is to let the moisture out... we ARE drying this meat out, and not cooking it.. right?)

Set your oven to the lowest possible setting. 150-180 if you can.. 200 and over.. you can do it, but keep that door open 1/4-1/2 to let heat and the moisture to fill your nostrils. Now is the hardest part.. we wait. 

and wait..

and wait..

And then the only question you should have.

How do I know when it is done?

Well, here is what you do.. take your meat flap.. and fold it in half. What we are looking for is it to crack when folded in half BUT NOT SNAP. this aint no 2x4. Think of when you snap a nice green twig off a tree branch for roasting marshmallows. It wants to snap, but it really splinters but stays together. This is the optimum time to pull it out like a catholic contraceptive. 

Also, nothing beats a nice piece of warm jerky. When it gets close.. hell yea, give in to temptation and taste test that shit.

If it gets too dry, or you have pieces with a lot of fat on them(so it doesn't go rancid)... throw them in a zip lock bag and put it in a fridge. I don't know why but it softens it right up. 

Now take your jerky.. hold it up, and swell in your man(or woman!)hood.

And then plan on making another batch. This shit doesn't last long. I always seem to lose mine in other peoples stomachs.

I found this subreddit one day just browsing around on reddit. I had already been in the process of trying to find not so much a ""diet"" but a different way of eating. 

I have suffered from severe stomach pains for the last 5 years. It got to the point where i was vomiting many times a day and vomiting up  blood. I tried different ways of eating that the doctors would suggest to me, none of them worked. I just got sicker and sicker, was in more pain everyday, everyday felt like a battle just to be able to get up and more around. 

I lost my job due to being sick, started drinking heavily spend the better part of 3 years being in a drunken state, depressed because I had to give up my job which i loved and drinking as much as I could because it would help me forget about the pain. 

When I stumbled across this subreddit and started to read a little but about it I became intrigued and started to read as much as I could. I quickly decided that I would give it a try, hell I didn't have anything to lose and everything to gain. 

Now onto more of less how I started and still continue with my way of eating today. 

1st) The day I started I decided I would go about this not a day at a time but a week at a time. I would prepare my dinners for the week along with lunch. So if i was going to have chicken I would make enough chicken for the whole week. I already had a foodsaver so it worked out well for me. Breakfast was and has been 3 eggs and 4 sausage links. Its 500 cals for the meal and very filling.

2nd)Lunches would always be what i was going to have for dinner that night, it was already cooked and ready to go just needed to be warmed up. 

3rd) Dinner would be the same for me for a week, a good example would be "" chicken thighs/broccoli,cauliflower, zucchini. 

Now I would always eat when i first started until I was full. No more no less. Snacks are always either pork rinds, sun flower seed kernels or almonds. 

I can answer any questions anyone might have for me.

Right now.,360,53,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/17aw9l/thinking_of_trying_keto_you_should_today_right_now/,"So, I found /r/btfc back in August and decided to give it a whirl.  I did a little bit of research about what diet/exercise combo gave me the best chances of winning, and I stumbled on /r/keto. 

So, I started it.  And I started exercising.  And I lost 12 pounds in 11 days, and it was unbelievable.

And then I just quit.

I honestly don't even know why I did.  I just... stopped.  And then the weight came back, so I stopped stepping on the scale.  And then it got worse and I buried my head in the sand.

And I ended up, 6 months later, about 10 pounds heavier than when I'd started - higher than I'd ever been.

I started back on the 18th, and I'm already down 8 pounds.

Seriously....Keto is magic.

For everyone out there who is thinking up excuses about why not to start.... just do it.  

I'm not gonna lie - it's (about) one week of hell.  Even if you are really careful to avoid Keto flu by keeping your electrolytes up (I salted the hell out of everything I ate and drank a TON of water), you're still going to go through a period of carb cravings.

There were a few moments last week where I could have stabbed a kitten for a doughnut.

It doesn't help that I'm a stay-at-home mom - I'm handing out crackers and cookies and cutting apples and oranges all day long, and being surrounded by that stuff and having my hands on it makes my mouth water.

For those of you like me with families who aren't conforming, here's my recommendation, and I know this goes against everything you'd think, but EAT.  Then eat some more.  And then some more.  Ignore your calories that first week or two and only pay attention to the carbs, and stuff yourself full of Keto foods.  It's SO much easier to say not to carbs if you're stuffed to the gills with steak and cheese and whatnot.  You'll eat less than you think.

Once you get your rhythm you can pay attention to the calories.... but it'll actually come easy by that point.  One of the weird side effects of this diet is the lack of hunger.    I mean, if I could ""legally"" and healthily throw back a whole bag of animal cookies and a gigantic bowl of ice cream right now, I would.  But do I feel like eating a spinach and bacon omelette right now?  No.  Ick.  

And that's the beauty of Keto - it teaches you to figure out the difference between hunger and cravings.

I know I sound kind of preachy for someone who is still relatively new at this, it's just that.... two weeks ago, I hated myself.  I mean, I loved my life, but I just hated what I had become.  I hated that I was that fat, stereotypical American mom - the kind they make fun of over in Europe, you know?  I felt disgusting.

And here we are, only a week and a half later, and I just feel so much better about where I am in my life.  I'm still wearing the same pants size, I'm still wearing the same shirts... but I feel sexy because I feel powerful (confident?) about how heading in the right direction, if that makes sense.  

On a side note, I have a friend who is my ""diet buddy"".  I am doing 1400 calories of Keto.  She is doing 1250 calories of carrots and boiled chicken breast.  We're doing the same amount of exercise (if anything she's doing more.)  I've lost over twice the amount of weight she has, and it's driving her nuts.  Keto works :)

I look forward to sharing updated photos with you all.

Also, I know there have to be lurkers out there who were like me - I still came and read everything here, even when I had ""quit"" Keto and was back to hating myself.  Come out of the woodwork, y'all.  Jump back on the ""treat your body right"" train.  It feels good :)

**TL;DR:  Keto works.  DUH.**


**Edit:**  I didn't want this to be an OMGWTFBBQ I LOST LOTS OF WEIGHT ON THIS CRASH DIET, YOU SHOULD TOO"" type post.  I included the weights because, honestly, reading about those and seeing the progress pics are what inspired me to go beyond reading and take the plunge the first few times.

They're almost always downvoted - and rightfully so.  But just to clear things up once and for all, I wanted to point out some of the research to back this up.

[This article](https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/artificial-sweeteners/MY00073) from the Mayo Clinic gives a good broad overview of the different types of artificial sweeteners.  It also points to the root of the ""fake sugar = cancer"" myth.  Back in the 70s, some studies on lab rats found a link between saccharine (sweet n low) and bladder cancer.  This has since been [deemed irrelavant](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/artificial-sweeteners) for humans though, as a combination of biological differences between humans and rats and the dosages involved mean there is *no actual risk* for humans.

[Here is an article](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/are-artificial-sweeteners-safe/) that spicifically details the safety of aspartame.  It also debunks some of the more popular myths about the substance.  The *only* exception is if you have a genetic condition called [phenylketonuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria).  If you have PKU, you must avoid aspartame.  Though if you have PKU, you'll already know this.  All infants are tested for the condition at birth, and as they must also avoid meat, nuts, and dairy, they're almost certainly not doing keto in the first place.

[This section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose#Safety_studies) of the wikipedia article on sucralose links to several of the over 100 human and animal studies showing the sweetener to be safe.  Even the National Cancer Institute, which claims damn-near-everything gives you cancer, [says it's safe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/artificial-sweeteners).

There are a few people still claiming artificial sweeteners are dangerous, but they're either quacks or hucksters (or both).  [This guy](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2000/12/3/sucralose-dangers.aspx) is one of the worst offenders.  His website is full of made-up horror stories about how sucralose is a neurotoxin worse than DDT (amazing how regulatory boards in over 90 countries failed to notice this ""fact"").  His site also full of links to buy his books, videos, and snake oil supplements.  Nearly all internet FUD about sucralose links back to this guy, as I'm sure was his original intent.  Nothing like using fear to sell your products.  He's been [thoroughly debunked](http://kentuckychemistry.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/on-the-similarities-between-sucralose-and-ddt/) by the legitimate scientific community.  

-----

If you don't *like* artificial sweeteners, then by all means, avoid them.  But if you do have a sweet tooth and you're minimizing carbs, then go ahead and load up on whichever artificial sweetener you prefer.  *They're not going to hurt you*.",,False,self,t5_2rske,1368894623.0,,,True,t3_1ekxs3,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ekxs3/ysk_sugar_substitutes_do_not_cause_cancer_have/,

I'll just go ahead and get the main picture out of the way here: http://i.imgur.com/zLR4Np7.jpg

I started dieting back in February of last year. I began with weight watchers' points system, and then decided about 4 months later that it wasn't going fast enough for me, and I wanted a bit more... substance out of my food. I'd lost 20 pounds by May/June when I started keto.

The first picture above is of my (now) wife and I at Christmas 2011. She also began dieting with me in February, and she managed to lose approximately another 60 pounds after this. She's currently pregnant and stagnating with the weight loss, understandably. She started keto before I did and converted me to her cause, so I have a lot to thank her for.

Here's a picture of us on our wedding day in June, with me weighing in at approximately 210-220: http://i.imgur.com/ERYkQAZ.jpg

I continued on keto for quite some time, and am still on the diet. I simply love the way it makes me feel. I'm also currently on a polyphasic sleep schedule and have found that a ketogenic diet GREATLY reduces the amount of time that you spend in light, useless sleep, freeing me up for more healthy, restful sleep in the 4 hours a day that I get it.

Here are some pictures of my wife and I at Thanksgiving 2012. Here I weighed about 155 or so.

I began my Keto journey back in July of 2012.  July 24th to be exact.  One of my coworkers had great success with it and for lack of a better explanation I dodged Keto for awhile, scared mostly about the naysayers.  I can say now that I do not regret anything and will continue to use Keto to meet my goal.

I've submitted many a food porn and posts containing random rants.  I've submitted blood test results.  But it's finally time to post some pictures.

Let me drop some back story.  I'm the typical ""big guy all my life"" but started gaining after high school.  I'm sure I topped out at 500lbs in 2011.  I ended up in the hospital with guillain-barre and a pulmonary embolism.  Scary times.  I dropped close to 50 pounds during that ""vacation"" (ha, vacation...) and was on my happy way eating better options for food.  Complacency set in, I returned to my old habit, and gained about 30 pounds before starting Keto.

I created this [album](http://imgur.com/a/UZ0A4) today.  If I ordered the photos correctly... which I hope I did.  I was probably around 450 lbs in the first photo, and the second photo was when I was at 483.  I believe in my February photos I was around 370, and today I'm at 362.

My weight loss has come from diet.  I've restricted calories on most days to 1200-1800 (sometimes as low as 1000).  I had great success with 16/8 and 20/4 mixed intermittent fasting.  I've also done a 3 day fat fast, where I think I lost 8 or 9 pounds.

My journey isn't over, and this year I haven't lost near as much weight as I had hoped I would but I'm okay with that.  I'm happy with what I've done and what I'm doing.  I will continue to eat low carb and to take it to the next level I'll be adding weightlifting.  My theoretic goal is to get to 240 lbs and I will continue to move towards it.

Thanks r/keto for all of the support you've given me over the last 8 months.

I’ve always battled him over this issue, resenting the fact that my Mom and the rest of the family are burdened by his weight.  His weight has been a major cause of tension between us.  


Anyway this story has a happy ending; 4-5 months ago when I was getting into the low-carb lifestyle, I showed him some of the youtube keto propaganda that I found through this subreddit. For some reason, after decades of rejecting diet after diet, something about keto finally clicked with him (The bacon?).


After 3 months of keto he has lost 35 lbs.  Last week he went to the doctor and all his pre-diabetic symptoms are now gone.  His doctor was amazed.

http://i.imgur.com/0nuCt3L.jpg

The pic on the left was taken about 4 months ago before I started lifting weights and keto. When I started lifting I was eating the typical 6 meals a day with brown rice, pasta blah blah, I gained a little muscle but could never shift the body fat and certainly wasn't losing weight then I discovered the pure magic of Keto about a month in and began to shed weight very quickly. I still want to lose a little more weight and try to get to around 10 11% body fat. 

I am eating around 1800 cals a day, when I go to the gym I try to increase this to around 2000. I think I was able to put on a little muscle with few calories because I has never lifted weights before. I mainly eat tuna and chicken for my proteins and use a lot of mayo and olive oil to make up my fats. 

I have also found that intense cardio has really helped me in the last month. I have dropped the most weight in the last month due to sprint. I would do 30 seconds sprinting or very fast run, 30 seconds rest for 10 mins 2-3 times a week, this really helped me shift a lot of weight.

I was thinking about the past few years the other day, and I was really curious as to how many carbs I was consuming during the periods of my life where I experienced the most weight loss. Luckily, I have been logging all (well, most) of my meals into MFP for the last 2+ years. 

I started being concious about what I ate when I was 265lbs, a little over two years ago, and I downloaded myfitnesspal with a hope that I could lose some weight, and start to feel better about myself. I didn't concern myself with protein or carbs, and adhered to the typical ""low fat, low cal"" way of thought that the media/food industry basically forces on everyone. 

Well, it worked. I started out making HUGE caloric deficits, eating between 700-1300 calories a day, and I lost weight fast. I was at my lightest two winters ago, when I was 155-160lbs. It was far, far too much (for contrast, I'm sitting at 185lbs right now, and I feel great.) 

I looked back on myfitnesspal to see the average of carbohydrates/fats/proteins I was eating daily at this point, around my most successful weight loss point. It turns out, I was eating about 300-500g of carbs daily, only 50-100g of proteins, and on some days, as little as 15-30g of protein. My average caloric intake daily at this point was 1700. I wasn't cheating, whatsoever. 

At this point, I was THIN. I was also partaking in little to no exercise, and had basically lost most of my muscle mass. I felt weak, but I was happy that I was so slender for the first time in my life. I was however, obsessed with food. I wasn't happy with the amount of food I was eating, and it was a constant source of stress and anxiety. 

Fast forward to now. I gained some of that weight back (thankfully..) and evened out at about 185. I was ""skinny fat"" (which I'm still working on.)

It's been 5 weeks into starting keto, and I'm honestly feeling better than I have in a long, long time. I'm eating at maintenance, or just under. I'm working out 5 days a week, lifting heavy at the gym, doing squats, presses, etc. My body fat percentage is sitting at about 19%, and I'm much more muscular than I've ever been. I've lost 5lbs so far with keto, and I'm seeing improvement in both strength and size as far as muscle growth. 

Here's the best part though. I'm happy with the food I'm eating. 

Really, truly, happy. I'm not craving carbs. I'm not sitting on the couch after meeting my caloric goal, beating myself up for wanting to go get a snack. I feel healthier. I'm putting more REAL, UNPROCESSED foods into my body. I'm eating vegetables, good fats, quality proteins, and I'm having fun doing it. I'm cooking more. And best of all, if I engorge myself on food (like I did last night. Honestly, I ate about 3000 calories over maintenance yesterday. Don't ask, I was ravenously hungry after an intense leg routine at the gym.) I don't hate myself for it. I don't wake up bloated, I don't stress all day about how I should drink caffeine for diuresis, or eat less, or workout harder (all very unhealthy practices, I know.) I just keep calm and Keto on, as you say. 

For the first time since my weightloss journey began, I'm happy with food. And I'm happy with myself. 

And THAT'S why I enjoy, and reccommend keto. Not because I feel that it's better for weight loss than calorie restriction alone, but because it's a healthier, more enjoyable alternative. 

I hope some reads this and takes something from it. If not, downvote me out of your view. See if I care. :D

Your own personal success stories kept me going through the keto motions. As for now, a little story time. 

Back in July I was hanging around 305 lbs while only 17. I was always one of the largest (and tallest) kids in my class for as long as I can remember. I had a pretty bad problem with not only eating tons of the wrong foods, but also overeating those same foods. It wouldn't be a surprise to anyone if I sat down and ate an entire bag of pretzels while  playing with my friends on my PC. At parties and gatherings I would always eat quite a bit much as well since, what's 4 or 5 slices of pizza to anyone? Overall I was a pretty big guy. 

Then one fine morning, disaster hit. My heart felt like it was filling with cement and my chest felt as if it locked up and was on fire. I sunk to the floor, trying to best catch myself, and attempted to deal with this immense pain. While it was only temporary it was a scary feeling. I am 17 and already having health problems with my heart. A few weeks prior I had even been diagnosed with a fatty liver. My blood was no different either as my blood pressure and heart rate were completely terrible. That moment in particular though got to me and I knew I needed to change. 

So how did I find Keto? Well one of the Youtubers I watched actually mention Keto in one of his videos a few months before I started the diet. I remember watching it and skimmed back to it. Because Reddit pretty much has a subreddit for everything I also checked Reddit and found this community and decided to join. 
Link to video in question: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-l8MRaWfxs

From there on out the rest was history, I'll let the pics do the talking. My start date for Keto was somewhere in late July.

As you can see, I seem to be missing a bit of my face. My old suit from July could probably be used as a blanket at this point. Once again, thanks to everyone who posted their own personal success stories, you sure as hell helped me along my own journey. My life is totally different than it was 6 months ago and I hope that anyone who is new to keto reading this somehow finds this helpful.

Part of my job involves quite a bit of annual training for my specialty area.

Today was sepsis class.  For those of you who have no idea what that means it is basically infection in the blood stream that causes loads and loads of bad things to happen, organs to fail, and has a 50% mortality rate in the US of &gt;750,000 people each year.

So what does this have to do with keto?  Well, a side effect of infection is elevated blood sugars in everyone.  Usually this is controlled with insulin.  After class I asked the educator why not put patients on a ketogenic diet and induce ketosis instead of throwing sugar-based solutions, feedings, and medications at the problem?  - - On a side note, this would constitute a paradigm shift if implemented.

So I was astounded when she told me that she had actually just read an article that the A.S.P.E.N. group (the gurus of patient nutrition in all its forms) was researching exactly that: placing septic patients on ketogenic diets!  Just with my limited knowledge I can come up with several reasons that a ketogenic diet might benefit my patients or make my care safer so this has me really excited!  If this research comes out and starts being implemented with positive outcomes this could be the beginning of something huge.

TL:DR The guru's of patient nutrition are researching using keto diets in hospitals to treat a condition with a 50% mortality rate.

Time it took: **266 days**

I don't even know where to begin and who to thank... Keto has been everything to me, and a way of life that I am completely in love with.

Don't want to go on to long, and I'll gladly answer any questions people have..

But here is a few things I did to keep myself whipped up during my journey:

* ate only between 1250-1500 kcal/day 
* never ate my exercise or cardio calories i burned
* counted calories like a mad scientist
* logged everything in MFP to keep myself in line
* measured all food i ate with food scale and measuring spoons
* drank nothing but water and coffee and occasional diet sodas
* walked wherever I went, took the stairs a lot
* play hockey twice a week and gym 1-2 times a week for 5K cardio jogs
* weight-lifting very sombre (but I will have to work on this more now to tone up)

She looked at what was there then asked me to come weigh in again on a different scale.  I did and she looked at me perplexed.  Then said ""this can't be right, the last time you were here it says you were 315, I think the scale is broken or they wrote it down wrong.""  I just smiled, shook my head and said ""no it's right.  I was 315 around 8 months ago.""  Her eyes got big and she asked what I have been doing.  ""I'm on a ketogenic diet"" I said.

Holy wow!,352,60,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/19tgf7/picsupdatensfw_1_month_on_keto_and_down_25_pounds/,"Okay, when I click on these posts the first place I go is to the pics, so here you go (NSFW warning...fat, shirtless dude): **http://i.imgur.com/zAgsAWX.jpg**

Now that that's out of the way, on to my story. I don't have much to say beyond what I've been journaling once a week on Facebook, so I'll just copypasta (copybacon??) it here:

* 1 week into the Keto diet. I'm firmly in ketosis and I've lost about 10 pounds (primarily water weight, don't get too excited). My hunger has diminished greatly and I don't snack hardly at all. When I do, it's very little. My breath smells bad (acetone breath as a bi-product of the ketone's breaking down), but Altoid's help when I need them before talking to someone. The best part, though, are the things I get to eat: Steak, beef, chicken, cheese, spinach, high-fat dressings (Ranch, Caesar, etc.), pepperoni, bacon, eggs, sausage, avocados, sunflower seeds, and pork rinds. It's amazing what you have to cut out to get down to 20g of carbs a day but it's also amazing the things you get the eat that we were always told were ""bad"" for us. I know I'm just getting started, but after doing a lot of research, I'm a total believer in this diet and the science behind it.

* Keto Week 2: 350 &gt; 338 - 12 pounds lost, 2 this week. I'm feeling really good on this diet and really comfortable with it. I notice my overall mood has been much more even. I'm not near as tired as what I used to be and I don't yawn near as much. My appetite is...interesting. There are times when I can go 16 hours between meals and not feel hungry, and other times I can go only about 4 hours before I want to eat again. I don't snack hardly at all, though, so that helps a lot. And even when I do, it's usually something like a cheese stick or a piece of ham and I'm good to go. It's hard to tell for sure, but I think my ""keto-breath"" has gotten better. Drinking a lot of water helps, and hoo boy do I drink a lot of water. Having very little carbs in my system and therefore virtually no glycogen stores means that I don't retain water like I used to, so it's a necessity to drink 4 - 5 liters a day. It also means I'm up a couple times during the night to pee, but that's manageable. Right now, I'm in a gray area between the very beginning of the diet and what is called being ""keto adapted"", which means my weight loss is very little if at all (it honestly fluctuates a couple pounds up and down every day), so it'll be interesting to see where I am next week after 3 weeks on the diet. So far so good though. The first week was tough, but I think I'm finally getting the hang of it.

* Keto Week 3: 350 &gt; 332 - 18 pounds lost, 6 this week. I think I'm finally keto-adapted. If not, I'm awfully close. I'm kind of shocked that I dropped 6 pounds in one week, but I don't think I'll keep up with that. Looking at myself, I don't think I look much thinner. Maybe a bit in my face and my sides, but nothing dramatic yet. One cool side effect has been forcing myself to be more inventive in the kitchen. Since ingredients are somewhat limited, I've had to find interesting and new ways to create meals and foods that work with this diet. For example, today I made something similar to a cinnamon roll using flax meal. I couldn't believe how fluffy it came out and how delicious it tasted! The next step will be to start incorporating some exercise once it warms up just a bit more. I'd really like to get back into running, biking, and swimming and really push myself in some triathlons later this year. I'm even toying with the idea of trying Redman [Ed. note - local iron-distance triathlon. I did the 1/2 iron two years ago, and it nearly killed me] again...but that's a ways away. Finally, I want to brag on [my wife] just a bit. She's been doing this right alongside me and not only has she lost 12 pounds, but her blood sugar has been consistently under control since we started! I'm so proud of her and can't wait to see her endocrinologist's reaction when she goes to see her next month!

* Keto Week 4 (1 month!!) - 350 &gt; 325 - 25 lbs lost, 7 this week. It's been a crazy month. I thought when I started that I would see good results, but this has exceeded my wildest expectations. I love the food I get to eat and generally how effortless this has been so far. It hasn't come without its challenges, of course. Reinventing everything you know about nutrition and finding ways to have some semblance of foods you used to enjoy has been interesting. I've learned to love broccoli and all the different ways you can prepare cauliflower. I've found which dressings do and don't work so well with spinach. Eggs have become my best friend, and I've discovered that you save a lot of money when you buy them in a pack of 3 dozen. I've made ""cinnamon rolls"" out of flax, fake gummy bears, fake sherbet, and found out that cream cheese mixed with cocoa powder and cinnamon with no sweeteners isn't near as good as it sounds. I've had to adapt my way of thinking and ordering meals at restaurants as well as exercise some restraint when those delicious carby appetizers come by. I'm learning to start listening to my body and recognize when it needs food and when I'm just thirsty.

I'm so pleased with the decision I made and the change in lifestyle. It's something that I adapted to quickly and can see sustaining for a long time. I understand that it may not be for everyone, but for me, it's perfect.

So, there you go. I also want to say thank you to the /r/keto community. This is what got me into the diet and coming to this sub every day and reading the successes, great foods, questions, and discussion has helped me tremendously. The knowledge base is tremendous and I always point people to the FAQ if they have questions about the diet (it really is an amazing resource).

I can't wait to check in on April 6th. I'm hoping to be under 300 by my 30th birthday (April 15th) and I really feel like I can do it!

edit:
For the eating part, I have bacon and eggs pretty much every morning and I don't really put any spices or condiments on it. For lunch I usually just have grilled chicken with ranch or a salad with ranch (I love putting ranch on everything). For dinner, just more chicken and ranch lol.
For the exercise I was in wrestling this past year and I started the diet right when we started lifting weights. So I attribute a lot of my ""transformation"" (I still have a long way to go) to being dedicated to my diet as well as lifting weights.
Also, if I'm tired of eating the same stuff everyday I change it up, like instead of having chicken and ranch for lunch/dinner, i'll either have a shake with heavy whipping cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk and a table spoon of peanut butter, or I sometimes will also have like 3-4 mcdoubles (without the buns of course). But I won't have these two specialty options for days in a row. (if that makes any sense).
Hope this somewhat helps.

1358277600.0,290,self.keto,16mtrl,Today is my 1 year keto anniversary!  55lbs lost.  Pics inside.,337,47,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/16mtrl/today_is_my_1_year_keto_anniversary_55lbs_lost/,"Hello r/keto!  Today, January 15th, marks my one year keto anniversary.  A year ago today I made a vow to myself to finally lose weight and get myself in better health, and I can safely say I've accomplished that goal.  I started last January 15th at 235.6lbs and hit 180lbs in September of 2012.

**How did I do it?**
I stuck with the usual: 20-30g of carbohydrates a day.  Mind you, I wasn't very strict when monitoring this like a lot of people are.  I just stuck mostly with meat and veggies.  I avoided bread, pasta, starches, drinks with calories(for 9 months I had nothing but water to drink) etc.  I never used ketostix either, but the telltale signs of keto were more than enough to let me know I was in a state of ketosis.

And this was all diet.  No exercise.

**What have I learned?**
More than anything, a year of a huge change like this has taught me about my body and how I respond to certain foods.  What foods I know I can eat and not gain, and what will make my scale weight jump up 3lbs the next day.  I also learned that certain carbs make me feel fat and bloated.  This is why I don't drink beer anymore.  It makes me feel like shit.

I also learned patience, and have rid myself of the ""I need results now"" mentality.  I've still got a little fat on me, but I've been working hard in the gym to rid myself of it.  This morning I texted my girlfriend ""My love handles are disappearing!  I'm guessing in a month or two they'll be gone for good!""

2 months for a change doesn't seem like a lot to me now, especially when you put a year in perspective and how MUCH I've accomplished in that time.  Before, the idea of spending 3 months on a diet seemed agonizing.  Now, 3 months is a small chunk of time to me to dedicate to something to see if I like it.

The trick to dieting for me: preparing excess portions for leftovers.  I need to have prepared food ready to consume or I know I will likely make bad choices.  When I cook chicken, I cook a ton of chicken.  If I have healthy food always ready to eat, then I've no problem succeeding.  Learn what works for **YOU!**

**Where do I go from here?**
Keto on!  I've been hitting the gym hard for the last 6 weeks.  I train weightlifting 3 days a week using Greyskull LP, and the other 3 days I do kettlebell workouts.  Yesterday I started Couch to 5K because my girlfriend and I are going to run Color Me Rad in April.  My goal for the year is to reach 10% body fat, and be lean and muscular.  

And before anyone asks, I experience no fatigue as a result of training low carb.  This may change in the future, who knows?  I expect when I start lifting really heavy weights that I will need to incorporate a carb day at some point, but this is uncharted territory for me so we'll see what happens.

I'd like to thank everyone here at r/keto for being a huge inspiration and help to me in this ongoing journey, and here's to another year! 

Feel free to ask any questions you'd like, I'm more than willing to answer.  And of course, here's what everyone wants to see, pics!

* I'm sending /u/darthluigi some simple base questions which he can mull over and send back to me
* Wednesday at around 17:00 GMT -6 I'll open a thread and post his answers, tag it as a mod thread and such for visibility. You guys can then start asking questions
* Starting at around 18:00 GMT -6 /u/darthluigi will start answering your questions at his convenience. 

I know it might sound odd to do it this way, but there are a few considerations:

* this allows the important/obvious info to be available ASAP
* it gives the community a chance to upvote the most interesting/relevant questions before comments start getting cluttered
* it makes the most of /u/darthluigi's time (we want to be good to our KOTWs)

1347215713.0,286,self.keto,zm1e3,[PSA] If you won't read the FAQ before posting at least read this.,353,67,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/zm1e3/psa_if_you_wont_read_the_faq_before_posting_at/,"I don't want to discourage anyone from feeling like they can't ask questions in this subreddit. I have noticed, however, that questions begin to get repeated more and more often before somebody offers a gentle reminder to read the FAQ or browse for your question before asking. 

That being said, here are a few pointers that I would like to present for those of you who are new to keto and also those of us who maybe have forgotten.

1. [Keto sticks are not an absolute.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#HowcanItellifIminketosis) Some people might never turn them purple. You might be one of those folks so stop worrying!

2. [The scale is not an absolute.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Whatwillmyweightlossprogresslooklike) Just because you're not losing weight it doesn't mean you're not losing inches. Measure yourself weekly. Some weeks neither sets of numbers will move.

3. How bad did you mess up? That can only be answered by [how you choose to continue to eat afterward](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Ischeatingworthit). Most of us have had moments of weakness. It happens. Searching for sympathy when you cheat is not a healthy way to deal with your blunder. You can do this, we support you, get back on the keto wagon right now.

4. The first week is different for everyone. Some people lose a lot of weight (possibly 10+ lbs), some people lose none, some people may even ""gain"". [Everyone's initial reaction to low carb is different](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Howlongwillittaketoreachketosis) so don't begin keto with specific expectations. 

5. Keto hasn't ""stopped"" working. [Plateaus happen](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#AllaboutPlateaus). Change something - what you're eating, what you're drinking, how you're exercising, etc. Search for hidden carbs in everything you put in your mouth. That includes cough syrup!

6. Keto flu comes in various shapes and sizes. Fatigue, muscle aches, lightheaded feeling, headaches, etc. [You may get some relief by drinking more water and adding salts and electrolytes.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Ifeeltiredandlightheaded)

7. By volume, muscle weighs more than fat. If you're incorporating exercise or weight lifting, keep in mind that the scale (again, it's not an absolute!) may move more slowly as your body burns off fat and adds muscle.

8. Liquor &gt; Wine &gt; Beer. Also, moderation. Avoid liquor with added flavoring to avoid unneccessary carbs, dry wine will have less carbs than the others, and yes there are some low carb beers out there. [Tread lightly, because keto might turn you into a cheap drunk](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#CanIstilldrinkalcoholcoffee).

*MOST IMPORTANTLY*, your journey through keto is unique to you. Not all of the rules or results will apply to you and you shouldn't expect them to. Do what you can and do it to the best of your ability and you will achieve success, keeping in mind that you didn't get fat overnight and therefor can't expect to get skinny overnight either. We are all in this together. **Relax, you've got this!**

Edit: Green_like_the_color makes a good point in that it is really easy to point somebody to the right area of the FAQ when you run across a question that is easily answered there, so I did the same to my post.

I was looking at another year wasted, and I knew that I wasn’t getting any younger. I realized it was time to take my life back. Getting my diet and exercise under control and seeing results gave me the confidence I tackle some of the other deficiencies in my live. 
I've been out of college for around three years and I was absolutely convinced that NO ONE would hire me.  I've probably applied for over 500 jobs, had a handful of interviews and not a single offer.  I took a menial job about two years ago to pay the bills and it had started to feel like I’d be there forever.  About a month after starting keto I decided to redouble my efforts in job searching and applied for about twenty jobs on a weekend. 
 I got a call for an interview, and it went really well.  A week or two passed and they called me in for a second interview.  They said they liked me, but were concerned that I lacked motivation and asked why I hadn’t worked in my field since graduation.  I admitted that I had grown a bit complacent in my current job and had almost lost hope of getting out of there.  Until I found keto, I told them about my realization that I needed to take my life back.  I told them that I had lost almost 50 lbs since mid-May and they were blown away. I got the feeling that they didn’t believe me. 
This morning I got the call, and I got the job! I’ll move back to an area where I LOVED living. I’ll double what I’m making now by the end of the month and I’ll be doing something I actually enjoy. And I couldn't have done it without r/keto!  If you’re on the fence, please don’t waste another day. Let this awesome community help you, and take your life back.

It was a great event, they had the most delicious strawberries (with no sugar added) and unsweetened heavy cream in a can, which I didn't even know was a thing that existed! So in addition to getting to have a great keto friendly snack, I hadn't seen anyone at the party in at least a year and close to ten dress sizes!

So, I used to date their son, and while we didn't break up because I was overweight, it was definitely a factor since he was a soccer player and looking for someone he could be active with. But today, wearing my skinny jeans, weighing 55 lbs less than the last time I saw him, and just being so much happier than the last time I saw him...it was a good day. I was watching the England-Sweden game with the men folk and he came walking down the hall and just came to a dead stop when he saw me. It took a bit longer for me to actually get around to talking to him (and meeting his girlfriend, who is lovely) and he mentioned several times how great I looked.

I'm so very in love with my boyfriend, but today it felt wonderful to have an ex see that not only am I healed and happy, I am healthier than I've been in all the time I've known his family.

I'm especially excited that if I can get this response from someone who isn't my boyfriend...when I see my actual boyfriend next week for the first time in nine months, having lost about 40 pounds since then, I imagine the reaction will be even more amazing.

Keto is a dietary method, and it's all about macronutrient balance. Nothing else. There are few things beside that we all can agree on.

I realize that some people think that things like caloric restriction, fiber, vegetables, cheating, not cheating, water, low protein intake, high protein intake, exercise and whatnot is crucial to keto. They might be to you, but not to everyone.

Please take a step back and think before you tell anyone that something that works for you is essential for them.

This should be true for any US retail store (so not the ones in Target and such, those are different but should be similar. There may be a different charge for heavy whipping cream).

Drinks:

* Any brewed coffee
* Any hot tea
* Any iced tea unsweetened (black, green or passion tea)
* Iced coffee unsweetened (you *should* be able to get it with heavy whipping cream for free)
* Americano (ETA: there is about 1g carb per espresso shot though)
* Any sugar free syrup is make with splenda (I believe), and should be okay.

For the iced teas and iced coffees, the sweetener is added separately, so you can always ask for it unsweetened.

ETA: There may be some regional differences in the iced teas and iced coffees. Out here in CA, it's just super concentrated fresh brewed tea and coffee but if your Starbucks uses a concentrate it may not be keto friendly.

Also, you can get heavy whipping cream in any drink. You can get a latte with heavy whipping cream if you like. If it's over 2oz there will be a .60 charge though. Some people may not know this, so if it's just a splash and they charge you you may want to point out that it's less than 2oz. ETA: If you don't want to worry about a fight about the .60 just ask for room and ask for heavy whipping cream when you pick up your drink.

ETA: Be smart about the heavy whipping cream, it is high calorie. A venti latte would have over 2000 calories with heavy whipping cream. And there are carbs in heavy whipping cream,  almost 7g in 8oz.

**Note:** Make sure they know you mean heavy whipping cream when you ask for it, especially in an iced coffee or the like. This is a VERY rare request and your barista might assume you mean half and half. I had that happen to me with an iced coffee once. Half and half is still a low(er) carb option but they do have the heavy whipping cream available. You want to see HC in the milk box and not B (short for breve which means half and half).

Options with a .60 charge:

* Latte with heavy whipping cream (warning: very high in calories)
* Caffe Misto (cafe au lait, so half coffee/half milk) with heavy whipping cream

For food:

* Dry Roasted Almonds (they should be right by the register)
* Cream Cheese
* Butter (ETA: apparently not available at all Starbucks, but should be available at all stand alone corporate stores. Not the ones in airports/Targets/Safeway, etc.)

That's the only guaranteed keto friendly food. 

However, since I work there and often don't have time to bring a lunch, I just eat the sandwiches without the bread. The breakfast sandwiches are the easiest to do this with. If you're eating there, you can even ask for it on a plate with a knife and fork and just toss the bread part and eat the egg, cheese and meat. Are there hidden carbs (especially the sausage)? Probably. But it hasn't ever kicked me out of ketosis.

**Chicken in sauce**

Chop a chicken breast into cubes and simmer in a small amount of chicken stock very gently for 30 minutes. Add a cup of sliced mushrooms and continue to simmer for 5 minutes or so. Stir in two tablespoons of smoked paprika and two tablespoons of hot paprika, three tablespoons of creme fraiche (or heavy cream with a tsp of vinegar) and half a cup of chopped parsley. Take off the heat immediately. Add a sprinkling of parmesan before serving.

Best thing to accompany: cauliflower



**Sole Meunier**

Either coat sole fillet in almond flour or leave plain.

Fry two sole fillets (lightly salt them first) in 1 tsp coconut oil for 2 minutes each side. Then add a lot of butter and when it foams, begin to baste the fish for a minute. Continue to cook until the butter is nut-brown.

Then add half a cup of chopped parsley, and the juice of half a lemon and immediately remove from the heat and serve.



**Beef Stew**

Take cubes of stewing beef and coat in paprika. Fry a few pieces at a time on a medium heat in coconut oil until just brown. Fry some pancetta/lardons/chopped bacon. Leave the bacon in the pan when just brown and add the beef back to the pan.

Then simmer in beef stock for 2 to 3 hours until the cubes are just falling apart. Add low carb vegetables of choice - I recommend zucchini/courgette and mushrooms and cook for 8 or so minutes more. Remove from the heat and add creme fraiche. Allow to cool a little an add some butter and chopped coriander leaves and finely chopped chilli pepper. Finish with a squeeze of lime and some grated cheddar cheese.



**Meatloaf**

Take one kilo of fatty minced beef and add 250 grams of sliced mushrooms and one grated zucchini/courgette and one egg. Add two tablespoons chopped chilli, one tablespoon chilli flakes, one tablespoon of ground cumin, one teaspoon cinnamon, two tablespoons dried oregano, one tablespoon salt. Stir very well and place into lined loaf tin and cook in oven on medium heat for an hour.

I was in there for some gastrointestinal issues that I had thought would go away after losing this much weight.  They are getting a little better, but I've still got a little ways to go...
The lowest weight I ever remember being was 220 in 2005 when I was in High School going to the gym every morning before school to try and get in shape.  It was working then but I wasn't really taking it that seriously.  
I remember being 280ish in 2008.  The weight gains in between those times were just because I didn't REALLY understand healthy eating.  The sad part is that I thought I did but just didn't care, obviously.  I never really noticed that I was getting that big.  I have always been the big kid and I thought it was because I was ""Big-Boned.""  You can see I'm not the smallest framed person in the world and my grandfathers on both sides of my family are two of the biggest (Frame-Wise) people I've ever known.  There were always times when I remember not being able to fit into clothes I used to but I just shrugged it off as growing...  
Over the summer of 2012 I was doing the whole counting calories bit, but not really what they consisted of.  It definitely wasn't until this Keto experience, especially once I got closer to my CW that I realized just how many Calories 2k a day is (even though now I do about 1600 a day).   It didn't help that at previous weights MFP said I could do 2800 a day!  
Nov 1st was the first day of the first month in a new residence for me.  I had done some research on Keto after hearing about it on Reddit and I decided to make that day the day to start.  It's been a good journey since then to get where I am now.  I've learned a lot and I feel much better.  I honestly have no idea what my GW is or when I'm going to start doing any real exercising, but Keto is treating me alright now and I have all of you to thank for it!

my coworkers have been commenting on my weight loss recently, and asking me what i'm doing to get these results.  i work with several older women who are a bit heavier and always looking to lose weight.  in fact, they started a biggest loser competition a couple of months ago- but quietly discontinued it when i pulled into the lead and no one else was making any progress.
 
the usual conversation goes:
 
""girl, what are you doing?  i need to be on whatever diet you are.""
""i don't eat any sugars or starches.""
""oh no, i can't do that.""
 
this is usually followed by something along the lines of ""i can't live without my desserts/pasta/rice/bread/etc.""  and it's the same line of interrogation i received from friends and family when i first told them about my keto resolution.  there's a lot of ""but you can't even eat fruit!  you love fruit!""
 
dude, i don't love fruit enough to be fat for it.
 
that's what keeps me going past fond thoughts of spaghetti.  prior to keto, i loved carb-heavy food.  i'm sure most of us did.  being asian, rice was a daily staple.  i didn't think this was a diet i could follow.
 
but i really had to consider what i was holding on to, and what it was worth to me.  that slice of cheesecake is not the last cheesecake on earth.  i can have a piece of it some day down the line when i'm not sitting uncomfortably, wearing a hoodie in 75 degree weather because my arms are too fat for the top i'm wearing.  none of these carb-rich foods are worth being fat, being horribly self-conscious, being unhealthy for.
 
i tricked myself for so many years thinking ""i can't do that.""  i fooled myself into believing that i really could not do without my comfort foods.  i ignored my perpetual daily headaches and rising blood pressure.  i kept thinking that deprivation of any food group would have terrible effects on my body.
 
i'm so glad that i found keto, because it's been more of a change in mindset than a change in diet for me.  my coworkers think i have this crazy iron will, but it's really just more of a perspective shift.  i don't grit my teeth and feel conflicted when i see a birthday cake in the kitchen.  i just look at it and think, ""that's not worth being fat for.""  and guess what?  i live just fine without cake.
 
i wish i could tell them all of this whenever they hear about my diet and react so strongly, saying ""oh i could never do that.""
 
if i can, anyone can.  seriously.

After [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ajeuz/low_budget_keto_is_it_possible/) post about low budget keto, I mentioned my methods.  I live on my own so it's very hard to have a lot of fresh food and to use it all before it goes bad.  So, I plan my meals through MFP, cook over a weekend and freeze them all individually.  I've got about a month's worth of lunches and dinners in this freezer.  It makes my life SO much easier and keeps me on track.  I spend about $130-$140 a month on food and feel like I eat like a queen.  Keep in mind, I live in Canada, our food costs are higher.  

Below are some of the recipes in the freezer.  Also, there are chicken burgers, chicken wings, frozen avocado (smoothies), cooked bacon, frozen chicken and ground beef (on sale).  Most of the recipes that I use never call for full cans of stuff, so instead of chucking it, freeze it, use it later.  Half a pepper?  Chop the rest, freeze it. 

* [Cheesy Hamburger &amp; Broccoli](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/cheesy_hamburg_broccoli_cass.html)
* [Stuffed Peppers](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/make_me_stuffed_peppers.html)
* [Meatloaf](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/meatloaf.html) - with spinach and cheese
* [Chicken Parmesan](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/chicken_parmesan2.html) - with shirataki noodles (which you don't freeze- learned the hard way)
* [Peanut Chicken Curry](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/chicken_with_peanut_curry_sauce.html)
* [Meatballs](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/baked_meatballs.html) - with zucchini ""pasta"" and lowest sugar tomato sauce that I can find.
* [Coconut Flour Pancakes](http://www.nourishingdays.com/2010/07/fluffy-coconut-flour-pancakes/)

I generally try to choose recipes that freeze fairly well or leave out ingredients like sour cream and add it later.  

Any questions, fire away.  I hope someone finds this useful! 

**EDIT** this does not include breakfasts (aside from the frozen pancakes) and snacks.  I recently discovered [Linda's Cheese Pie](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/moms_cheese_pie.html) made without the crust and baked individually in ramekins.  It's delicious and usually counts as my night snack.

[NSFW]",318,51,489,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/151f44/i_need_help_or_im_probably_going_to_die_nsfw/,"First off, I'm having a slight panic attack just typing this out. The fact that I actually took pictures AND uploaded them to the internet has me breaking out in hives. 

Secondly, this is a new account. I have a secret life online, and I wish to keep it that way since it's my only means of happiness. 

I am 5'2 or so, and 350lbs the last time I was weighed in July. I've always been fat, and it's sort of evened out in the past few years. I went from 289lbs to 350lbs in around 6 years. 

I've tried diets. I've tried working out. I used to be fairly active. I even used to run. I have a very hard time losing weight. I have hypothyroidism, but the pills never worked for me. I sort of gave up. 

I get heart pains frequently. My body always hurts. Taking out my trash or walking back and forth in my house makes me out of breath. I'm fairly certain I'm either close to diabetes or full blown. I rarely leave my house. I have no real life friends or family...no support system. I'm all alone except for my pets. And my online life. I need this life, so I can't reach out for help from them. They will shun me, and then I will have no one.

I'm terrified. I don't want to die. I want to live for my pets. I want to be happy, have fun...I want to live for once. I'm in my mid 20's. I shouldn't be living like an old person. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

My budget is incredibly limited. I can't afford a gym membership, let alone the funds to get there and back. I have no energy. None. Zero. Less than even. I wake up feeling exhausted. 

I need help. I really, really do. 

I'm willing to work out somehow at home...sit ups, walking in circles, yoga, whatever. I'm willing to figure out a diet plan. From what I've read, Keto sounds like it's the way to go when you're a land whale like me. I live on food stamps, and I do try to buy mainly healthy foods, but I sometimes buy the bad stuff just because it's cheaper. 

I'm not looking for a pity party, I'm looking for advice, help, support, whatever. 

I don't want to die alone and have my body rot into the floorboards. It's one of my biggest fears. Nobody will even know I've died until my body has wasted away completely. I want to be missed. 

And now the pictures. I've edited them to keep my privacy as much as possible. My hands are shaking right now. I went all out with these. I'm totally naked before you. Please don't crush my soul.

My mom has noticed that I haven't eaten any rice or noodles and asked me why today. Even though I was hesitant, I told her that I have completely cut out all starches/sugars from my diet and went into a little detail about what my diet now consists of. I braced myself for a lecture about the importance of rice but she didn't say a word. 

30 minutes later she gives me this plate of food! It's not the prettiest but it was delicious.

* 4oz of salmon belly glazed with garlic black bean sauce 
* Cilantro/green onion/asparagus tossed in the residual salmon oil
* Pea shoots sauteed with garlic
* Ginger poached chicken offal - heart and gizzard

I'm smiling like an idiot and dig in. I finish everything except the salmon belly because it is SO rich. My mom takes my plate and starts to wash it. (I usually do my own dishes) I look over and I can see that she is tearing up. WTF, I freak out and ask her what's wrong. 

She explains...she would rather I eat rice but she didn't care because she hasn't seen me eat so heartily since I was going through puberty. After puberty hit I have always been a little pudgy (about 20lbs overweight on a 5'4"" frame) and my mom has watched me diet for the past 12 or so years. She said no matter how old I get, it's really hard to watch your child eat lean cuisines and nibble on crackers for dinner. She said she knew when I was starving myself even though I tried my best to hide it. She knew I was ALWAYS hungry. 

She cried, she told me about how she had to run when the Japanese invaded her village in China and how she remembers very vividly how hungry she was during the ordeal. She could never understand why someone would subject themselves to feeling that just to be thinner. At this point, I started to cry too - I really had no idea my dieting cause her to worry so much. I feel fucking terrible. 

She said she doesn't really understand keto but hopes I eat like this forever and never go back to dieting even if it means no rice. I don't ever plan on looking back. 3.5 weeks in, no cheat days. I wake at 5:30am with no trouble and I feel healthy. 15lbs to go and I hope to incorporate low sugar fruit or do a hybrid keto/paleo diet to maintain. 

Tomorrow we're going to the Boiling Crab - shrimp, crab and lobster smothered in cajun garlic butter. Oooh yeah!

This is the album of a picture every week starting on January 30th 2012 to January 28th 2013. Here's another picture I've shared with some people, taken around April 2011 http://i.imgur.com/Q3x3MEw.jpg. To my knowledge I was around 385. Now that some pictures are out of the way I'll give a little more information on this.

**Diet/Food**

I'll start with giving my MFP account just in case anybody wants to add me. Things aren't that exciting but you can check what I ate and the consistencies www.myfitnesspal.com/fodazey. Here's a general breakdown of the foods I ate:

*Protein*

- Lean chicken

- Lean/extra lean ground beef

- Beef/pork steaks (cut was depending on price, I wasn't too worried about it)

- Whey protein (Dymatize Iso-100 and Kaizen whey from Costco)

- Eggs

- Fish (mostly smoked salmon)

A lot of people would think ""oh man, those aren't fatty cuts of meat"" and I agree, but after awhile you learn that getting your protein to where it needs to be is harder with fatty cuts of meat while still saying under calories. So instead of using up fat on meat, I use lean cuts so I can use more fats within my cooking if need be. 

*Fat*

- Unsalted butter

- Extra virgin olive oil

- Renee's ceaser/ranch/blue cheese dressing

- Hellman's mayo

- Coconut oil

Pretty simple here. Use butter for cooking, olive oil for random stuff, salad dressing in salad and mayo for things like dip or coleslaw dressing (mayo, liquid sweetener, mustard and vinegar). Coconut oil has been used for some random 'dessert' things because I never really enjoyed it for cooking. 

*Vegetables*

- Broccoli

- Cauliflower

- Spinach/baby spinach 

- Lettuce

- Avocado

- Brussel sprouts

- Bell peppers (more so green than any other color)

- Mushroom

- Onion

Once again, pretty simple here. I ate some kind of vegetable in every meal. My go-to vegetable dishes are creamed spinach, caulimash, sauted broccoli or just an easy salad. Mushroom and pepper were used for my Philly cheese steak dish. I also made the occasional chili with kidney beans and crushed tomatoes but that happens once every few months. Other than that I keep things pretty simple and didn't over think it. 

*Dairy/Miscellaneous*

- Cream cheese

- Heavy cream

- Sour cream

- Cheeses (provolone, havarti, cheddar, parmasan, etc.)

- Almond milk

- Almond/peanut butter

- Sesame/pumpkin seeds

- Spices (onion/garlic/chili powder, paprika, cayenne, half salt)

- Low carb ketchup (I bought this at SuperStore in Canada)

- SugarTwin liquid sweetener

- Almonds/walnuts/macadamias

Self explanatory here. I use cream cheese for some chicken dishes or mix it with avocado for a nice dip/topping. Cream is used for creamed spinach and a little depth in the ice cream I make. Almond milk for drinking and recipes. Almond/peanut butter goes in the ice cream or just take a spoonful for the lulz. Sesame seeds are used in the sesame bar courtesy of keto4life. Ketchup is used for taco salad or just general dipping (or homemade russian dressing). These are things though that aren't used every day but are convenient to have.

**Exercise**

Initially I did plan on working out and I've done a few spurts but prior injuries have forced me to go into physio therapy. It proved to me that I was doing the majority of exercises wrong anyway and that the just getting a good foundation was better for me at the time being. I do plan on going back to Strong Lifts once advised by my therapist. Until then, I'm doing body stuff like plank variations, squats and some muscle stretch/strengthening things for adductors/glutes/core and things targeted for my prior injuries. If I could go back I would have started therapy a lot earlier in hopes that I could be working out full time by now but that's all hindsight.

**Miscellaneous Info**

Other than all of what you can see here, I kept my keto simple. I've upped my calories because initially I would be at 1500 and I really didn't want to screw over my metabolism so I've since upped my calories to 1800+. In the beginning, as most people experience, I wasn't hungry at all. Know that this changes and you shouldn't really hold yourself back on calories. On days that I'm hungry I'll just eat but stay keto and more than likely I'll still lose. I've gone through phases of absolute hunger or absolute non-hunger. Just know that our bodies are trying to tell us something so eating over calories for a day won't hurt as long as you stay in parameters. 

As for water, I just drank until I was hydrated and gauged it off of my bathroom use. If my urine was anything not close to clear I was probably slightly dehydrated so I just drank. Some days you'll really feel thirsty, some not, I find it goes in cycles. 

Besides all of that I did use fasting to my advantage to fit in meals. Some days 16/8, some days 20/4, some days not at all. As I've said before, there are days when you're hungry and some days you aren't and you just need to be aware of how your body is reacting and what to do for it.

If there's any other questions, feel free to ask.

1371389914.0,260,self.keto,1ggbm4,[Update]Tomorrow is my 30th birthday and I just hit my goal weight!,318,58,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ggbm4/updatetomorrow_is_my_30th_birthday_and_i_just_hit/,"Pretty excited. I've always been kinda chubby, even as a kid, but kind ballooned up after college (desk job and all). A friend of mine recommended Keto after he had a lot of success and after trying calorie counting, vegetarianism, and a few other things I figured why not.

The first 50 came off with diet changes alone (no working out). That took me 4 months, then another 3 to lose another 13 as I guess I was gaining muscle while burning fat and I was on/off keto. For the first 4 months I usually skipped breakfast, but if I ate breakfast, it was three eggs and 4 pieces of bacon. Lunch usually consisted of 100grams of spinach, 1tbsp full fat Caesar dressing, 2 oz of salami and 2oz of cheese. Dinner was usually meat and a veggie. I really didn't eat much of anything else. However when I started working out I kinda fell off the wagon. I ate all my meals keto, but would cheat with snacks (handful of chips, a few pieces of chocolate, small things) with probably kicked me out of keto. I also bought those Bryers Low Carb Fudge bars but would eat 2-3 a day :( I was still losing weight, just at a slower pace as I wasn't in keto. However a few weeks ago I buckled down and got back to strict Keto like I did when I first started. No more snacks, no more low carb fudge bars that I'd binge on.  The weight has started coming off quickly again.

My workouts are pretty basic. I do the 30 minute circuit at planet fitness which basically has 10 stations that work different parts of the body and 10 stepping stations. I also ride my road bike about 60-80 miles a week.

I think I'm going to update my new goal weight to 175. I still have a bit of torso fat and some around my thighs. I'd like to get lean.

Keto on everyone!

1360081032.0,261,self.keto,17xs28,[Pics] xpost from loseit. Started working on my health while I was paralyzed; no longer paralyzed and I lost 140 lbs.,310,49,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/17xs28/pics_xpost_from_loseit_started_working_on_my/,"A fellow redditor from [r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) pointed out this subreddit to me when I posted there. Then I realized I've been on a Keto diet the past year of my life. He mentioned you guys might like my story, so I figured what the hell. Thanks, [Arclight](http://www.reddit.com/user/Arclight)!

So just a little *back* story on what I've been through the past year to drop the weight.. I woke up paralyzed from the bellybutton down about a year ago, due to a sports injury back in high school. A disk in my upper back was restricting my spinal cord; luckily it didn't sever. The funny thing is, I'm glad it happened; it changed my life forever. So a year later I'm 140+ lbs lighter, and probably 200% more in shape than what I was before the paralysis. This is all with zero surgery, really hard work, and little miracles. I truly am lucky! I may have lost a year of my life recovering, but I gained a lifetime of wisdom from it. If there's a lot of interest, I can edit this with what happened to cause this. 


I started my weight loss Journey with a 1200 calorie diet, which worked out really well. Once I started to plateau I switched to a low carb diet, called [Keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto). I allotted myself 20 carbs a day, which I mainly got from my coffee cream in the morning. You can eat all the protein you want, but the main structure of a meal is normally protein and a veggie, as well as a fiber. Exercise is key though, as it is with any sort of diet. You HAVE to stick with it, no matter what. You can come up with really lame excuses to why you shouldn't work out that day, but you're only hurting yourself in the long run. My exercise when I first started was walking around a tiny living room floor on my walker three times, then gradually increasing where I could walk the surface area of the house. Along with walking, I used a little motorized bicycle that I could use while sitting in my chair. Even though I couldn't lift my legs to pedal that bike yet, the pedals turned for me, so I was forced to endure the work out. I started with 5 minutes and worked my way up to 30 min cycles. What came next was swimming. It's literally the best work out you can get, and it's non-weight-bearing. The day I was able to walk up the steps to the pool is the day things accelerated, progress-wise. I swam laps for an hour straight and then ran in the pool for about 30 mins at first, then worked up to an hour. I got to the point where I did all of this every single day, no matter how sore or tired I was; I even kept adding on more time/reps. This sounds really crazy, but it's easy when you see progress. Losing weight gets addicting, trust me. You have to constantly push yourself, even if it's one more step. Those steps add up and it counts. The biggest thing to remember is you're not just dieting or working out, you're making a lifestyle change. 


These days I'm back to a weight training regiment; where I don't put a ton of pressure on my back, because that would basically be suicide. I'm also running for 45 mins a day around the neighborhood. Yup, running. No more walker, wheelchair, or any sort of assistance. 


The doctors told me I would never walk again. They literally said, look, you can get surgery on your back; however you would be taking a huge gamble. The chances were incredibly high that I would be paralyzed upon waking up; they also said if I didn't get surgery, that eventually I would be paralyzed. Obviously this devastated me, but one night it was like i flipped a switch. Instead of sitting around depressed that I'm morbidly obese and paralyzed; I literally said, ""I'm not going to live my life like this the rest of my days. There's no way in hell that this is it. Fuck that."" My experience made me believe in the power of human willpower. You can do anything you want in life, if you want it bad enough. Take me as living proof; I shouldn't be walking right now, let alone running.


The main reason I'm posting is to gain a little bit of motivation back. Life is amazing right now for me, I've even managed to bring an amazing woman into my life recently. She loves me more than anything, and it's for who I am, which to me is really beautiful; I honestly couldn't be happier. I figured if I couldn't get pumped up to go another 100 lbs, then perhaps I could inspire someone to change their life around, or even just to motivate them.

Anyways, I have a few progress pictures: 

* [430ish lbs](http://i.imgur.com/sYJi6KK.jpg) Not exactly my highest, but close. 
* [380 lbs](http://imgur.com/SCcLDEf) Don't mind that beastly mane. 
* [360 lbs](http://imgur.com/At6iLkz) 
* [320ish lbs](http://imgur.com/n2YpAqn) 

Here are some pictures of me within the last couple months: 

* A few face shots: [First](http://imgur.com/88XcTyz), and [Second](http://imgur.com/oUbiwsG). 

* These are the best body shots I have at the moment, I'll probably go take one after this post if it's requested; kind of cracking up that in three of these I have my black hoodie on. Damn you weather! [First](http://imgur.com/1wjbk3Q), [Second](http://imgur.com/P7DpMDO), and the [Third](http://imgur.com/TVIw8WA). Please don't mind that purple thing on the right.. it's obviously not my room, lol. I swear. 
* The [last](http://imgur.com/KBgwSoO) one for now; I know this is a douchey picture, but it's the only non-hoodied picture I have on me at this moment. I don't feel very photogenic, and generally don't take many pictures. I don't like the picture itself but I'm loving my shoulders so far, lol.

Thanks for reading :D I hope I could inspire some people with my journey, which isn't quite over yet, I'd like to lose another 100 lbs.. I would be pretty satisfied with 50 more as well. Any feedback or advice is most welcome :)

She is down around 30 lbs and looking great. She Still wants to get about 25 more off I think she said. I have lost a little over 50 lbs now and have a goal to lose about 70 more lbs. 

We started going to the gym together about 5 weeks ago then my wife hurt her ankle and we have not been going for a couple weeks now. This was our first night back and we road stationary bikes about a half hour then walked the track outside for a while. 

While we were on our walk outside we were talking about our losses and how it was feeling to get smaller. (Now I normally would never share the rest of this but I feel pretty close to you guys now since we are all on the difficult process to lose weight together. You all are sort of my weight loss support family) That being said I told my wife I feel for the first time like my belly isn't sticking so far out but instead is starting to get floppy at my belt line. I hope this is making since what I'm talking about. It just feels more like a lot of skin now I guess as opposed to a mass of fat hanging over my belt and it only sticks out inches instead of a foot like it used to. My wife then looked at me and said she knows and that the best thing was my belly doesn't slap her in the forehead anymore when she is orally pleasuring me. I about fell over on the track laughing. 

I had never thought about it when it was happening cause I was just enjoying what was being done. At least now she is not receiving brain damage for loving me. Anyway I hope this doesn't offend anyone. I would normally never share something like this in a public forum like this but I felt it was a small weight loss victory that others could enjoy. 

We have been married 19 yrs this past March and I have been overweight for the majority of those years. I really hate this is something that she actually thought about or didn't like during our love making. She had never said anything about it before and I would never had picked up on it. I hope this doesn't embarrass her too much and I told her I was going to share it with you all because it was so funny but also something others of you may not realize or have thought about either. As our bodies get smaller and more in shape we are able to enjoy many things better about life even sex or foreplay in this case. 

Thanks to all of you who have been encouraging me whether you know you are doing it or not.

I am pre-diabetic with PCOS and I'm sick of being unhealthy and feeling unattractive more often than not.

I go through phases of working out regularly but never longer than a couple months or so at a time (hoping that gympact and the fear of losing money will change that)

Anyhoo I'm here because I need community and support :) I found a translated version of ""Keto in a Nutshell"" and printed it out for my mom because she'd never understand it in English. I live in a household where there is *always* rice available. And if not rice, then bread, etc., you get the idea. So not eating a bowl of rice with every meal is going to be a Big Deal for me and my family. 

Knowing my mother though there's no way we're going to just throw out the huge 20 pound bag of rice in our kitchen, so I have to prepare myself to resist some major temptation.

See you guys around!

Personally I haven't had this issue and thought that perhaps it may be the approach I choose to introduce the diet.

&gt; Essentially I have quit sugar; I realized that I was highly addicted to sugar and that its effects were doing horrible things to my life.  For instance if I didn't eat for a while I would get horribly cranky or if I ate a bunch of sugary food I'd be really down and depressed the following day (all mostly verified from some searches online).

&gt; In place of sugar now I eat more fats (not transfats mind you) which I have found to be the only way to feel properly satisfied with my meals.

&gt;Additionally, I have cut out low nutrient dense carbs like starchy foods like pasta, rice and potatos.  Instead I eat greens like spinache and brocolli which are very nutrient dense.

&gt; Interestingly, by my estimate if you ignore the high fat content my diet is actually much healthier (by popular standards) than it was when I was eating high carb meals that I was filling my stomach with only to eat even unhealthier snacks afterward.  With fat I feel satiated having eaten less food than I did before and do not need to have snacks in between meals (sometimes even between breakfast one day and the next).

Anyway, I find guiding people through a logical thought process rather than directly introducing concepts that break their existing belief system much more conducive to them accepting how and why I am eating the way I do.

Hope this helps others.  Obviously not everything applies to everyone but I'm sure it can be modified to suit the individual.",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_197fb2,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/197fb2/how_i_describe_how_i_eat_keto_to_people/,

Even when you hit your goal.",306,48,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ebaa2/a_lesson_from_a_keto_vet_if_youre_going_to_commit/,"My story in a nutshell:  Ever since college (~13 years ago), when my metabolism started weaning, I slowly but steadily gained weight, precipitated by a sedentary lifestyle.  At 5'8"", I was around 210 lbs.  Last May, I started keto, and by October, I had dropped a little over 30 pounds and hit my goal of 175. Everyone noticed the difference, I felt better than I had in years, I could do more, got tired less, it was awesome.

After that, I put myself in ""maintenance"" mode where I eased off a bit and made my daily carb limit higher, took Saturdays ""off"", which turned into ""OK, Fridays and Saturdays"", which turned into ""Well, why not just Friday through Sunday"".  Holidays used to be a time to shine where I could show myself the willpower to stay on keto in the midst of heavy temptation, but turned into ""Meh, it's just one day, I'll catch up later.""

The take-away is this: For most people, myself included, that mindset is nothing but a VERY slippery slope.  I gained back a significant amount of weight very slowly to the point where I've started actually seeing a difference in my appearance again, for the worse.

I'm back on the wagon now with a new commitment, but can't help but think of where I'd be had I not back-slid for several months, and now have to play catch-up just to get where I was before.

So even when (or ESPECIALLY when) you hit your first goal, don't get complacent.  Stick with it.  Remember, it's not a diet. It's a lifestyle change.",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_1ebaa2,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ebaa2/a_lesson_from_a_keto_vet_if_youre_going_to_commit/,
1359450122.0,257,self.keto,17hky6,Stretch marks? Try coconut oil!,306,49,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/17hky6/stretch_marks_try_coconut_oil/,"Ok, a couple of weeks ago I discovered the magic of coconut oil thanks to the lovely ladies over in /r/thegirlsurvivalguide. I read all about how much it helped tighten and moisturize skin during weight loss and made stretch marks pretty much invisible. I went out and bought myself a container as soon as I could and man, I wish I did it sooner!!! Every night I glob it on all over my body, and it's working wonders. I used to have horrible, red stretch marks all over my tummy, upper arms and thighs - since using coconut oil once a day, these have become incredibly less red (and much less sore) and some of the older ones are getting more and more invisible every day. I had some ""silver ones"", which have now become a (much less noticeable) skin colour. I also had a few crease marks from fatty rolls that were a slightly pinker colour to the rest of my skin, since I'm pretty pale, and since using the coconut oil, these have become much less noticeable as well. Oh, and I also used to have little red bumps on my arms, which have also faded away! Not really keto/weight loss related, but awesome none the less! It's amazing, I can't believe something as simple as coconut oil can clear all this up. I use it on everything now... Feet, legs, lips, face... I've never had such soft skin before! But my favourite is what it's doing to my stretch marks.  

So basically, it looks like [this](http://i.ihttp://i.imgur.com/52rOzXH.jpg). I got this from an aussie chemist, so there's probably a hundred different types, but most of them come in a jar like this - as it's used for cooking. I've read you can buy it from most chemists, health food stores and grocers. You just get a [chunk](http://i.imgur.com/juP77uK.jpg) out (or however much you want to use at a time) and then just rub your hands together until it turns to [oil](http://i.imgur.com/1PBwuYZ.jpg). It'll only take a few seconds. Then, just glob it on EVERYWHERE. 

I usually do it after a shower and before bed.  



I thought I'd share, since I don't think too many people know much about it. I know a lot of people (on /r/keto especially) hate their stretch marks like I do and honestly, it's making a huge difference. So yeah... Coconut oil. Check it out - it is AMAZING!!! Pick up a bottle next time you're out and you won't regret it. :) Plus, it smells delicious! :D You'll smell like a yummy coconut for a few hours, which is also nice.

I never thought I'd be able to get rid of most of these marks and was getting really depressed about it, so I really hope some of you guys and girls out there which marks that bother you try this out because it really works! You won't see results overnight, but trust me, if you do it every day, after a few weeks, you will notice the difference! :)

EDIT: Also, never get water in it! It will go gross and/or moldy.

I don't have any problem with posts that invoke intelligent conversation on cheating/recovery or asking for help, but from now on any posts advocating cheating/cheating experiences or posts which make it difficult on users who struggle with self-control will now be removed. This includes posts along the lines of, ""I ate 42lbs of fries and donuts last night and I'm still in keto! yay!"".

We understand the benefits of controlled carb-ups for intense workouts and breaking plateaus in some people's cases. This is not the same thing as a ""cheat"". It's a controlled dietary approach to build muscle and burn the last few lbs. Posts pertaining to CKD, TKD and posts asking how to make the best out of a bad situation will not be removed.

I understand this decision will be controversial to a handful of /r/keto members who *really* like cake, but this community is supportive of people who want to succeed and there's no sense in making it more difficult on people who already struggle to stick to a new lifestyle. Our community exploded in January and we want to see our noobs succeed.

Thanks for reading.

I found r/keto by happenstance while browsing reddit and gave it a try and in the end wound up loosing ~30 pounds in 5 weeks. I am shocked that something that works so well so quickly is such a secret, and I have a feeling that it won't be a niche market for much longer.

As a result I am considering creating an iOS and Android app focused on Keto dieting, and am wondering how much interest there would be in such a thing. And if there was interest, what r/keto frequenters would want and expect from it. To put it lightly there is a *lot* of dieting apps on the app store already. It is possibly the most saturated market there is. So if I am going to dive into it I want to be sure there are some people that would find it useful.

I already have an app half way through development for an upcoming keto cooking youtube channel/blog that a friend will be releasing in the next couple of months. Initially the app was just going to break up the youtube videos into individual steps so you could follow along on your phone/ipad while cooking, but now I am considering being a bit more ambitious with it and making it a more general Keto diet companion app.


These are the extra features I am considering at the moment

 * A keto recipe cookbook database with user ratings and reviews

 * Recipe ""Mods""
	* Each recipe would have a ""Popular Variations"" tab allowing the community to add or substitute a step or ingredient to keep thing organized, so we wouldn't wind up with 6 different keto pancake recipes different only by the type of flour they use.

 * A fat/protien/carb tracker and all the commonly used food calculators
	
 * Some kind of web interface (either a simple website, or a flash  app on the blog) allowing access to your tracking data from your computer as well as your phone (cloud storage/data syncing)

 * ""Substitute"" product database
	* not sure exactly how this would manifest itself, but essentially it would be a user rated product recommendation system. So for example when looking for a keto friendly replacement for say ""maple syrup"", the app would display a list of brand recommendations rated and reviewed by the users.

 * And finally the original intent of the app, the features relevant to the accompanying youtube series/blog

How many here would be interested in an app like this? What features would be mandatory for you to be at all interested in using it? What keto specific features would aid you on your diet that you currently can't get from the numerous existing dieting apps on the market? And if you are interested, would you prefer it to be a free app with mobile ads, or a 99 cent app with no ads?



EDIT: Wow I am glad to see there is so much interest. When I can see the light at the end of the tunnel I will start posting some regular progress updates. In all likelihood the youtube channel will be releasing before the app does, so I may be chiming in again sometime soon for some suggestions on it as well. Thanks for the support, I'll keep you posted.

It will forever be my go-to diet when I need to cut/lose weight again. Here are the results I achieved in 11 weeks on keto! http://i.imgur.com/l3Mz4Fd.jpg

The first 9 weeks were a breeze, I would eat 1600 calories a day, and get through my intense workouts, HIIT sessions, kickboxing and work with no problem. In the 10th week I hit a serious wall, I was incredibly tired all the time and mentally exhausted. Even though my body was looking better than ever, I was starting to look sickly and gaunt in the face. I think it was just a pro-longed period on such a big calorie deficit, not so much the keto... 

I hung on another 2 weeks, and then finally tapped out at 11 weeks, after achieving my weightloss goals.

My problem was I knew I had to start eating more calories, but I was worried that I'd put the fat back on, and eating more carbs scared me even more. I decided what I would do is take my waist, and chest measurements along with my weight and monitor my caloric intake for the first week(s) to put my mind at ease, and make sure everythings stable.

So I calculated my maintenance calories using Lyle Mcdonalds basic method. It said 2500 per day, but to be safe I decided to eat 2300. I upped my carbs to 100g a day, and let me tell you, once you reach your goal weight, it feels so great to be able to NOT eat at a calorie deficit. I have alot more energy and can eat much more food without putting on weight.   http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/how-to-estimate-maintenance-caloric-intake.html

I have noticed my muscles, now full of glycogen/water, appear bigger. My explosive power has definitely increased, and for some reason it seems like my abs are getting clearer. Here is a photo I took today (albeit after a hard workout)

Anyway I just to remind you guys and girls to not be afraid of carbs once you reach your goal weight. Just keep tracking your progress and eat at your maintenance calories when you get there, and good things keep happening!

1321318646.0,241,self.keto,mcg7p,Been eating this way for almost five years now... Changed my life.,288,47,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mcg7p/been_eating_this_way_for_almost_five_years_now/,"Can't believe I just stumbled on this subreddit full of My People! I thought, in case there are any folks out there struggling with the idea of eating this way forever, my story might be of some inspiration...

In 2007, after twentysomething years of eating complete shit (and occasionally trying to lose weight by counting calories, doing Weight Watchers, etc), I suddenly started to gain weight like whoa. I mean, I'd always been on the heavier side of normal for a girl, but never, erm, *fat.* Now, all of a sudden, it was like I couldn't *not* gain weight. I'm 5'8"", but at 178 pounds, I was starting to pass plump and move into fat. Worse yet, I noticed that something about my appetite felt different: I literally could not get delicious foods like chips with queso, or chocolate peanut butter ice cream, off my mind. Worst of all, even when I ate them, *I never felt full*. 

It's so terrifying to feel like your appetite is betraying you. Terrifying too to try to diet as the mainstream says you should, and not only be starving, but also not drop a pound of weight. I cried nightly into my rice cakes and low-cal soup. And then one day I stumbled across an Atkins book in a thrift store and thought, ""Seriously, what do I have to lose? Atkins is so unhealthy -- but if it helps me to *stop getting fatter*, I am down with unhealthy.""

I laugh looking back at that moment. My entire life I'd been the low energy one, the girl who barely made the 1 mile run in gym class, who frowned in puzzlement when everyone said, ""Enjoy life now, this is the most energy you'll ever have!""

Well, they were wrong and so was I, when I thought LC would be an unhealthy way to lose weight.

Trying a very low carb, very high fat, moderate protein diet  meant learning to cook: truly a desperate measure, in my view back then! But the prospect of becoming truly fat seemed even more desperate. So, I looked up a bunch of easy recipes on low carb forums. I baked chicken and bought string cheese and made some truly disgusting meals in the beginning and winced as I added tablespoons of butter to my eggs.

But within three days I saw one difference that kept me going: while I felt like shit, a pounding headache, starting awake at night on bolts of nervous energy, *I wasn't constantly hungry* any longer. And that alone was enough to keep me going in the beginning.

About a week in, I started noticing something else: *I wasn't always tired.* In fact, I had almost too MUCH energy, at first. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was getting so much stuff done. Errands didn't exhaust me. I no longer had to fight to stay awake in the afternoons. Instead of wanting twelve hours of sleep a night, I was waking up after eight or nine. 

""Holy shit,"" I thought. 

Oh, and I'd also dropped five pounds.

It took me about six months to complete the weight loss period. I ended up dropping forty pounds. As a thirteen year old, I'd been told by my doctor (upon starting yet another round of Weight Watchers) that because of my genetics and my build, I needed to be reasonable in my weight loss goals: I'd never be smaller than a size 10/12.

Since my weight loss, my default has been a size six.

At some point along the way, after I'd put in a lot of hard work learning to cook (all sorts of things - endless meat dishes; pot roasts; flaxseed crackers and low carb muffins for treats; learning to enjoy cooking, in fact), it all became natural. And along the way, even while losing weight, I kind of forgot eventually about weight loss as the ultimate goal, because for the first time in my life, I just felt so damned good. And all that extra energy? It finally drove me to the gym, where I discovered that I'd never been into exercise because I'd never before had the *energy* to exercise. Now I had it, I understood why so many people loved it.

I'm not sure why some people react so dramatically to a ketogenic diet. But for those of us who do, it's such a godsend that the idea of ""slipping"" back into old ways gradually becomes unintelligible. Sure, I occasionally have some pizza here and there; I'll eat ice cream on my birthday. But these are rare and special things, and I don't miss them afterward, and having them no longer triggers cravings for more. After almost five years of eating this way, it IS the norm. 

Anyway, a very long way of saying: GO KETO! And go all of you, and I'm so glad I found this subreddit!

As I write this from being six weeks strong now on strict keto, I offer up some tips to those in the first few weeks/just starting that helped me stay strong in the face of sweet things, sugary snacks and carbs.

- When people asked me about keto or laughed at my plate of bacon, broccoli &amp; swiss cheese, just laugh back at them.
- Don't treat keto as a 'diet'. It's not. I just think of it as a lifestyle 'experiment' that I enjoy.
- I have a massive sweet tooth. I found that the cravings for chocolate/sweets came at certain 'weak' spots during the day. So rather than just say ""cut all sugar"", I dug a bit deeper and listened to my body of when I craved it most. For me, it was mid-afternoon, and straight after dinner. So I scheduled a coffee for each of those times (or tea). As soon as that 3pm craving for milky sugary chocolate came over me, I just made a strong coffee with heavy cream (along with the usual 3L of water each day of course).
- Someone on here wrote a huge self-post a while back which really resonated with me for a particular point: don't think long-term on this. Set day-by-day goals. Each day as it comes. You made it one day without sugar or starchy carbs? WINNER. Now just do it again and again. Small gains, large rewards.
- Last but not least, make an effort to drop in on /r/keto once a day at least. I don't know about you guys, but I find it super SUPER inspiring to come here and look at food porn, inspiring stories, belt-notch snaps, people's progress pictures etc. UPVOTES all round!",,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,t3_x2e97,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/x2e97/some_tips_on_staying_strong_and_avoiding/,

1373660691.0,240,self.keto,1i6de1,Things I know after a year on Keto,285,45,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1i6de1/things_i_know_after_a_year_on_keto/,"After a year on keto and more than a few pounds lost, I am now an old man and therefore an internet expert. :).   These are some of the things I know after having learned them, and perhaps they will be helpful to your journey and success.

1.  Weight loss is about diet, exercise is about fitness.   You are way overweight (that's why you are here at keto) and therefore for some time, stop worrying about exercise.  Exercise is great for body composition, but it doesn't have dick to do with weight loss.  I can't tell you how many people I see come on here with great plans to do keto, exercise and do all this other stuff and within 3 weeks they disappear never to return.   They may just be bored with /r/keto, but my guess is that it's too hard trying to do everything at once.  Ignore the exercise at first.  pay attention to the diet.   The diet is hard at first, it's a pretty dramatic change and the diet is way more important.  Set doing some exercise as a goal (after I reach X lbs, after I lose X lbs, I'll start doing run/walk/lift/whatever)

2.  Weight loss is definitely emotional.   Don't deny it, but learn from it.  You can be a success, this does work and if you stay with it, you will be in better shape.  This is why stalls and plateau's are so dammed frustrating.  You are doing everything ""right"" and the body is not cooperating and it's like rebellion and anger against your own body.  

3.  On the subject of anger, we have totally been lied to for the last 40 years about food.  Makes you wonder what else they (government/media/monsanto/etc) are lying about?   If I had known all this 20 years ago I certainly would never have gotten as big as I did.

4.  nobody reads the FAQ.  Ok, that may be a little harsh, but a LOT of people do not read the FAQ.   Lots of experienced people on here who have been there and done that and they get tired (me included) of reading the same question 4 times a day that's answered in the FAQ.  Read the FAQ, it's quite good and there is a lot of information in there.   On the same subject, nobody uses search either, or reads before posting.   Seriously, use the search, Luke.  

5.  Monthly reports, updates, pictures, stories are dammed motivational.   Best part of my day is reading/seeing those stories of success and showing that anyone and everyone can do it.

6.  Cheating sucks and isn't worth it.  This is a strict diet in one parameter (everything else is pretty wide open), falling off after only a week, 3 days, a month is not good for your long term health or success.  The first month is hard as your body adapts, but it's offset by the rapid weight loss.  The 2nd month is harder.  Almost everyone stalls, the diet gets boring (or can), the weight loss slows.  you see a lot of people disappear at the 6 week mark.   Be strong, stay on it, it really gets easier and after 3 months just becomes a normal way of doing things.   Keto is like magic, but it's still hard work, you have to think and check everything and some places and foods are just off limits and you just need to accept that.   It works, but it still takes some time.  It didn't go on a week, it's not going to come off in a week.   Be strict for the first 3 months, then do what you want.  After that 3 months it will be a lot more normal.   do you want to be healthy/skinny/look good naked or do you want to eat that one piece of cake?

7.  I haven't seen this posted in a while but it used to be around here a lot.  ""The next year is going to pass whether you choose to do anything about your weight or not"".    I like that statement.  

8.  Fathead, the movie is really helpful in explaining things to family and friends who really don't understand.  (it's on netflix)

9.  Carbs are dammed addictive.  Anyone who doesn't think so has never tried to quit.  

10.   Find a real butcher, your town certainly has one.  Grocery store meat SUCKS, it's just terrible.  yeah, you might pay 50cents of a dollar more a pound, but it's worth every penny.  The yield is better, the cut is better, the meat has taste.  You're saving a ton of money eating keto (which sounds counter intuitive, but if you've been here a while you know it's true), take a few of those saved dollars/euros/pounds and treat yourself to real meat instead of crap.   A fishmonger is great too if you happen to have one.  

11.  use a food log (for at least the first 3 months as above).   Way too many people post issues here and have no food log.  No food log means we can't help you.  YOU need to know what you are eating.  And since people really only eat about 10-20 things a week (this is true BTW), after you get it set up, it's pretty easy.   There are tons of tools here, but for me, the key number is grams of carbs.  Keep that at 20 a day or less and everything else falls into place, including your appetite. 

12.  Stalled?  (not just PISS, but a real stall).  Start the food log up again, track meticulously.   Drink more water.  Stop drinking any diet drinks.  Get more sleep/take a nap (seriously, this matters a lot).  Cut out dairy.  Those solve probably 90% of the stalls.   But do one thing at a time so you learn what stalls you.  What stalls me may not stall you.  

13.   Moderation.  Yes, I know, I preach strictness and paying attention.  But after those first 3 months, this is a marathon and really a lifestyle change.  Low carb works, but going low carb and then going back to standard diet is just going to get you fat again.  You wouldn't be here if your body could handle the standard carb heavy diet.  And to be a lifestyle change, it has to be maintainable.  This means real food (no shakes that simply won't last beyond a few months) and sometimes it means taking a breather.  maybe you have an anniversary or birthday or just a night out.  But plan it, don't allow it to just happen and make sure you get right back on plan.   A meal is moderation, a week is falling off the wagon.  It's an addiction and it's always going to be there, you need to plan for it.  

14.  There are some great recipe sites on here and I've tried a bunch of them and some of them sound really good.  But for me and my wife, we eat meat, cheese, and green leafy veggies.  Simple, easy, tasty with only occasional ""hard"" recipes.  It's real food (it's probably some what paleo/primal) and it's maintainable.  It's also easy to eat out as you know what you can have and what you can't.   This may not work for everyone, but I bring it up because sometimes you see people trying all these neat sounding dishes, but that's hard week after week, month after month.  Even in standard diet, people only eat 10-20 different meals, work thru and find yours.  

15.  nobody listens to you, even when your success is blatantly obvious.   It's always ""too hard, can't give up X or Y (fruit is common), that's not healthy"".   You can try, but it's really easier and more successful to wait for them to come to you with an open mind  (or failure at everything else)

16.  It is dammed good to be 2/3 of the man I used to be and I wish I had found this years and years ago.  I'll be on some form of low carb for the rest of my life, that's obvious, but that's ok.  I eat well, I'm full and I'm (almost) in shape.  I feel 15 years younger and except for my missing hair, I am 15 years younger.

I hope that helps and i wish everyone success on their journey.

Picture on the left was this morning and on the right was mid- december. 

What can I say, these past two months on keto have been insane. This is actually my first time posting anything ever on reddit, and I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit specifically. 

Me:
I'm 20, 5' 8"", Asian, and started at 223lbs in January. My current goal weight is 170 but will vary based on aestethics. 

Diet:
I basically never counted calories, drank as much water as possible, kept carbs at basically 0, and half- assedly kept the fat to protein ratio pretty substantial like probably 80/20. This'll probably surprise a lot of you, I probably drink on average 15 to 20 shots of vodka/whiskey/tequila/rum a week, actually counting calories those days I drank and eating some fruit beforehand... probably not the healthiest of habits but... college. lulz. 

Exercise:
I work out about 4 to 6 times a week doing about 20-30 minutes of cardio which includes rowing, cycling, and running. I also lift everyday making sure to keep improving on reps and strength. 

Fun Fact:
Probably what got me my losses the quickest is the fact that I'm a pretty hardcore raver. If you've ever been to a rave, you know that it's probably the best cardio you can get that lasts for about 5 hours. To give you an idea of how hardcore of a raver I am, I've been to about 22 shows and 2 festivals, which are multi day raves that last about 8 hours a day, since new years. I'm only a sober/drunk raver so I don't do drugs so don't think that contributed to my weightloss. 

For those who care:
I started this keto journey because I didn't want to be hindered by my weight any longer and it's easier dancing with hot girls at raves if you're not creepy or fat so... yeah. Also, I've been fat since I was 9.

But in all seriousness, I'd like to thank everyone on this subreddit for giving me the inspiration and the motivation to start this diet and to embrace a different lifestyle. I literally check this subreddit everyday because seeing other people go for their goals motivates me to shoot for mine. 

Anyways. PLUR and Keto on you guys, I'll definitely post again when I reach my goal. I'll definitely try to answer any questions in the comments too :).",,False,self,t5_2rske,1363867317.0,,,True,t3_1aq73t,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1aq73t/pics_two_month_progress_223_to_185/,

Hi Loseit.  I started my weight loss process almost three years ago.  Since I have kept the weight off for almost two years, I'm considering myself successful enough to make a post about it.  

I hope this post helps somebody else.  My weight loss and lifestyle changes really helped to bring me out of a negative time in my life, and made me realize that nothing tastes as good as being healthier feels.

The most important thing I learned about weight loss?  The process to lose weight is not unique in most people, but the motivation is, and must be unlocked.  

I was 26 years old, teaching full time, brand new baby, and new house.  I was on a strict diet of everything in excess.  I like to eat a lot at a time, and love sweets of all kind.  I also worked the majority of the waking day to ensure that my program was successful.  I saw fast food and the wrong foods as the only option with my busy schedule.  And that is how I became over 250lbs.  

My motivation came from a few places:


   * I was 26 years old, and I could barely play with my daughter without getting winded.  I wanted to be that young dad that could chase his kids around the yard.
   * I was at a size 38 pant, and they were getting stretched.  My shirt size was XXL, and I was only comfortable as long as I was completely covered in multiple layers of dark clothing.  I wanted to be a guy that could wear whatever he wanted.
   * I started shopping for vitamins and personal care products on a health site.  I wanted to share this with people, but no one took me seriously, as I was not the image of what I was sharing.  I wanted to walk the walk.
   * A custodian at my school came to me on a Monday, and reminded me that kids weren't supposed to be eating in my classroom.  I told her they weren't.  She told me that she found McDonald's bags in the garbaged can.  I told her they were mine from today.  She laughed, and said that there was no way possible that all of those bags came from one person.  I then lied, and said I would talk to the kids about it.  
   * I hated how I looked, and wouldn't even look in the mirror in the morning.  I wanted this feeling to go away.


I started a few days before my 27th birthday.  My process came from a variety of sources, including some that are popular and some that are not so popular.  My sources worked for me.  If you disagree with them, that's fine, but here's some tough love.  I was reading an article written by financial expert Dave Ramsey on reducing debt.  Dave's strategy is to snowball debt by paying off the lowest balance first, and then then using the monthly payment from the paid off bill to add to the monthly payment of the second highest bill, and so on.  I remember Dave's quote going something like this: ""Now you might be thinking that the better way to go about this is to pay off the highest interest loan first in order to save money.  And I'll say this - if you were so good with numbers, you wouldn't be reading my article.""   Not trying to be a jerk, but that hit home.

Feeling like I had no motivation and no place to get help with my problem, I did my daily routine of working, and then browsing some sites until bed.  I found a post on either Lifehacker.com or gizmodo.com about the Slow Carb Diet by Tim Ferriss (I know Ferriss is kind of a polarizing figure - just stay with me for a bit).  

I read the article, and decided that I would try this out, as it would be better than the nothing that I was currently doing.  However, I decided to only take parts of it.  In short, I did a lower carb diet with a cheat day that turned into a low carb diet with cheat meals on a cheat day.  I have always been able to lose 10-15 lbs on a low carb diet, but didn't have the discipline to stick with it.  I felt that a planned ""cheat day"" would help.  I also ate high fat to feel full longer.  I'm sure it's been said to death, but eating fat doesn't make you fat.  And my cholesterol numbers improved, so that worked in my favor as well.

I also felt that I had four options:


  1. Do nothing, get no results.
  2. Eat better, and get some results.
  3. Exercise, and get some results.
  4. Eat better, and exercise, and get great results.

I choice option two.  I realized that eating better is a huge change, and exercise is also a huge change.  I was only prepared to take on one, and eating was something I'd have to do every day anyhow.

In more detail, here is how I started:

Phase 1:


   * Starting weight of 250 lbs.  I downloaded the Loseit App (I love how it gave me badges/""achievements"" like it was a game).  Logged everything I ate.
   * Tuesday-Sunday I ate 100 grams of carbs or less.  I didn't count calories, sodium, fiber, anything.  Just carbs.  This allowed me certain fast food items.  Every morning I had a Big and Toasty sandwich from Dunkin' Donuts, or I had a couple of servings of some cereal.  Tried to eat within an hour of waking.  
   * Switched to drinking only water, coffee, and diet soda.  *Note - the diet soda eventually went out of hand.  16 Diet cokes in one day?  Not so good for you or anyone.  Eventually dropped soda in all forms.
   * Monday was my ""cheat day.""  I picked Monday because I felt it was my most stressful.  I eventually moved to Wednesdays (my longest day) and finally settled on Saturdays due to social allowances. 

Under 100 carbs a day helped me to lose 25lbs with visible results in about two months.  I was feeling better, dropped a pant size, and my face was thinner looking based on reactions from others.  I felt that this process was working, so I decided to enter into the next phase.

Phase 2:


   * Current weight was 225lbs.  I kept going with Loseit.  Had my 25lb badge, and internet strangers giving my virtual high fives.
   * Sunday-Friday I ate 70 carbs or less.  Still didn't count anything else.  This still allowed plenty of wiggle room, but I had to make sure that I was a little stricter with making sure that food items stayed within my count.
   * Cheat days were Saturday.  In this phase, I noticed I wasn't looking forward to them as much.  I even tried to skip them, but would ultimately end up cheating on a Monday or Tuesday.  I'd get right back on track, though, and wouldn't allow another one until six consecutive days passed.

Under 70 carbs a day helped me to lose 20 pounds in almost two months.  Sitting at 205lbs, I had a huge surge of energy, drive and motivation to get rid of the 2 in front of my number.  This leads to…

Phase 3


   * Current weight was 205.  Loseit was still very helpful with logging food.
   * I switched to 50 carbs or less every day, but often would stay around 30-40.  
   * Completely took soda of all forms out of my diet.  I only drank coffee, green tea, or water.  I peed every 20 minutes, but learned the pattern of the tiles behind the urinal perfectly.
   * Cheat days continued, but I started getting headaches from the insane amount of sugar intake on them.  A coke would actually give me a huge surge in energy, as opposed to 250lb me getting no effect from it.  Sunday mornings did not feel good, and I had no desire to see junk food after a cheat day.

Under 50 carbs a day: pant size was now a 34 if I sucked it in really well.  Weight was sitting at 190.  My goal was 180lbs (my high school weight).  I felt so good now, but I had to reach that goal.  

Phase 4


   * current weight was 190.  I still used Loseit, but started fooling around with MyFitnessPal.  I really enjoyed the scanning input of foods.
   * I reduced carb intake to less than 35 carbs a day.  I could still do a sandwich if I wanted to, or even some small junk food.  Unfortunately, junk food often sends me into a whirlwind of eating everything in sight, so I tried to avoid it all together.  
   * Cheat days continued, but in varied forms.  I love to eat a lot at once - I started having just one or two larger cheat meals on a cheat day, taking in around 2, 3, 400 carbs.  Felt terrible after them.  Still kept on track.


Under 35 carbs a day: I could squeeze into a 32 (my high school pant size).  Finally got down to my first goal of 180 within a month and a half.  This was the hardest phase so far, but I started to really love how I looked and presented myself.  It was completely worth it at this point (and before).

I kept going at it, staying around 30-40 carbs a day, and made it to my second goal of 170.  My lowest was 165, but I had exercise slightly to get there (I took hour long walks every day…nothing too major).  I now currently sit at 170-175, and try to stay here.  My danger weight is 180, and I avoid ever going above that.  Certain brands I can fit into a 30 pant size (down from 38), and my average shirt size is medium, although some smalls fit me.  

If you've made it through the novel above, keep going - here are some thoughts, reflections and suggestions on how I made it work.



   * Persistence, insistence, and consistence will help success.
   * Work for small changes.  Losing even one pound is worth it, and should be taken as a big deal.  Everyone can do it, but not everyone does.  
   * My work schedule was still hectic for a while, as I took over a new program.  I tried to cook a lot, but also kept a list of approved fast food items.  All burgers, no bun.  Jimmy John's Unwiches (get a card; after you purchase so many, you get one free).  Wendy's chicken salads were a staple of mine, and Culver's burgers, with cheese, no bun, extra mayo.  I want one now.  At home, all meats, all vegetables, cheese (stayed away from milk).
   * We all know how to lose weight.  Most of us are not more special or unique in that science and body chemistry does not apply to us.  
   * Log ALL food.
   * Buy a Brita Bottle or Brita pitcher.  Never pass up a bathroom.
   * Don't tell people you're losing weight.  Just don't do it.  Trust me.  
   * Don't tell people how you're trying to lose weight unless you want puzzled looks, unwanted advice, and frustration.
   * Don't use special events as an excuse to eat junk.  I skipped cake on my birthday, and waited until my cheat day.  My brother used to be on a diet called the ""S Diet.""  It was no Sweets or Seconds except on Special occasions or days of the week that start with S.  The problem?  You can make a special event out of anything.  ANYTHING.  Monday?  Bob's birthday.  Gotta have cake.  Tuesday?  mom and dad are in town.  Let's go out.  Wednesday?  kid in my class brought me cupcakes they baked.  Can't let them go to waste.  Thursday?  Faculty is going out.  Bob bought appetizers.  Friday?  National Holiday in some other country.  Better celebrate.  (I'm not even trying to be funny about this - some of you know how we can make our selves think that we need to participate in these ""special events"" with food.)
   * Scales are not an enemy, but make sure that you are measuring progress in at least two ways.  For me, I used scales, measuring arms, legs, waist, etc.
   * Eating healthier or real food might seem like it costs more money, but imagine how much you'll be saving on medical bills.
   * Water, tea, or coffee.  Get rid of the soda ASAP.  I also stayed away from juice, except for V8.
   * I associated the word ""snack"" with pre-school or elementary school, and avoided eating them as a practice of discipline.  I ate when I was hungry, but also realized that as an adult, I should have the willpower or discipline to hold off on eating if I was a little ""uncomfortable.""  This took a bit to get used to.  If you do what I did, it's ok to eat larger meals as long as you are staying within your counts.  
   * Too much fiber is a bad thing.  Trust me on this one as well.
   * Stare at yourself in the mirror, and get to know every single centimeter of yourself so you can compare changes.  On days that I felt I didn't have much progress, it was nice to see that a hip bone was starting to present itself slightly.  
   * Don't expect an athletic body without doing some work, but expect some weight loss if you are just focusing on diet.  

For anyone doubting that they can do it, please know that you can.  Although my story is probably not the most successful story on here, it's important to me, and I want all of you to have your own positive story.  Let me know how I can help.

I've been at keto diligently for 3 weeks now and I've gained 5lbs. I've been under my calorie goal, I've tried all of your wonderful suggestions, and it just isn't coming off. My ketostix register me as having ""moderate"" to ""large"" ketones daily. Needless to say, I am frustrated. 

Here is where the greater than great news comes in: I was at the gym today ( I started working out 3/17 for the first time in my life. I have never stepped foot inside a gym before then. ) and I was on the elliptical going my usual pace. Two empties on either side and wouldn't you know it, two of the most fit people I have ever seen in real life jumped on those machines and started working out, making a fatty sandwich. It should be noted that they didn't come at the same time and they didn't know each other. 

So, I just continued on, trying not feel inadequate next to these two fitness gurus. I push it hard and I notice they are looking over me at each other with wide eyes. I immediately turn my music off, thinking I am causing the elliptical to whine under my weight, or I am making some horrific breathing noises. I hear nothing. They notice me noticing them so they go back to their work outs. I'm getting even more flushed with the thought that they are making fun of me non verbally - who am I kidding, hauling 338 pounds of body mass around on a machine like its going to make any difference? All I do is gain weight. 

I try to shake the anxiety from my mind and resolve to finish my workout. When I am finished with the cool down, I start wiping the machine and take my earbuds out. I notice the healthy bastards on either side of me are now smiling, almost snickering. I feel sick to my stomach and am hurrying to wipe the last part of the display off when the guy reaches over and touches my arm gently and says ""I want you to know that I am blown away by how fit you are. I don't know if you meant to or not but you were keeping up with me and I honestly couldn't believe it. I am impressed, I think she is too (he pointed to the model on the other side of me), and you should be very proud of yourself. Keep up the good work!""

I've spent twenty minutes in the parking lot trying to figure out how to process something like this. I have never been physically active, certainly not fit enough to keep up with someone like them. I am just so happy that he had the decency to speak up and tell me what they were smiling about, because I really was fearing the worst. It turns out, I was fearing it for no reason at all. While I am still not pleased with my inability to lose pounds, I am thrilled that I was able to keep pace on the elliptical with a man half my size.

I don't think there's anything wrong with a little ketovangelism; politely and tactfully suggesting someone consider carbohydrate restriction if they have already told you they want to lose weight, and the context of the situation suggests it's appropriate.

Can I have a word with those willing to listen?,300,71,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/znyhn/hey_rketo_can_i_have_a_word_with_those_willing_to/,"A quck forward- this isn't a ""OMG KETO CHANGED MY LIFE' post, but rather, a ""Keto changed the way I THINK about life"" post, so please bear with my words, as I have a few things I'd like to share.


First things first. When I was feeling really down about myself in July of this year, I knew that I had to make changes. On break from second my job, I passed by a GNC weight machine, and thought about all the times I've passed by it and not weighed myself, for fear of being scared of what the numbers would show. But for some reason, that day, I weighed myself. 


Boom. 245. At 19 years old. 


Crushed, but yet inspired, I looked for diets online. Having been a redditor for a good amount of time, I looked for diets on reddit. Keto was the first one I saw, and also have heard about it before on Reddit. I started the next day. Only then did I realize that I was having bread, rice, and pasta every day. I'm not exagerating when I say every day; I somehow deluded myself into thinking that having an exorbitant amount of rice and beans everyday would be okay if I had some salad with it. 


The first day hit me like a truck. It was hard. I never realized how many carbs I was having in a given day. But its not just about the carbs. It's about the type of food I was eating. McDonalds, Mexican Food, Chinese Food... Hearing these make me sick as I type this. I wasn't beeing good to my body. 


The next couple of days sucked; they mirrored my first day expierience, which was not particularly memorable. I got what you guys call, the Keto flu. Headaches, stomach felt weird, etc. But I trudged through. Week two was where my body started to slowly adjust to my diet. I knew it was going to be a slow and steady journey to 200lbs, and if I quit, it would only reflect on my lack of willpower.


So, having two jobs, one being in an office from 7am to 4pm and another being at a mall kiosk in a food court from 4pm to 9pm M-F, I quit my second job. I took myself away from the temptations of fast food, and other shit I didn't need. I didn't need the extra money, It was only for pocket change to buy geek stuff, and more fucking food, so it wasn't a huge deal for me. What was a huge deal, was the amount of food I was consuming out of sheer *boredom* at that job. I now think of how lame it is to eat when your not hungry. Who does that? I did. But not anymore.


So the weeks go by. Eggs and bacon for breakfast. Dark green salad for lunch. Hungry during the day? Handful of almonds. Then I discovered food processors, Whole Foods, and almond butter by the pound. Well shit, I think I'm starting to enjoy this type of food. 


Month one. July 31st. Down to 235. Okay. 10lbs? Not bad. But was I happy? Mostly. Hell, even if it was one pound, it shows me that I have the willpower to Keto effectively, and that made me happy.


Month two starts in August, and I tell myself I want to lose more, but not at the sake of losing my happiness because of my diet. Ill explain briefly. First month, the ladyfriend was loving that I lost ten pounds. Second month rolls by, and whilst she still likes my devotion to a diet, she didn't like how restrictive my diet was in terms of what I can eat when we go out, which was usually food loaded with carbs.


So, for the sake of happiness, I cheat on Saturdays. I split a medium popcorn with my girlfriend every Saturday. Yup. Ends Ketosis, ends no carbs, ends the weeklong spree of my being an excellent keto-er. But, It makes me happy. It makes me look forward to an awesome weekend with my girlfriend. I love it. Granted, the first week I had popcorn, I threw it all up hours later, but that was because I had too much, was eating too quickly, but more importantly, my body wasn't used to that many carbs. So what do I do now? Portion control baby, portion control. On top of that, It makes me more regimented for the week to come, it gives me motivation to really step my game up in terms of not overeating to compensate my for my popcorn, and eating healthy.


Month three, September. I haven't weighed myself since the 31st of July. I hate weighing myself. I feel like cheating once a week with some popcorn is going to somehow make me gain back all the weight I lost, plus some. Although I was eating healthy, walking to work instead of taking the metro, and getting better quality foods, I was convinced I was going to step on the scale and see 250. I was scared, what can I say.

But then I thought about why I started Keto. I started because I wanted to lose weight. No, I wanted to do keto because I needed a change in my eating habits. I forgot that keto was supposed to be a change in lifestyle, not a temporary thing that I was going to do so I can temporarily lose weight.


Where am I getting to with this block of text? I'll tell you. I no longer follow the Keto diet to the letter. Instead, I'm going to use the keto diet as [guidelines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6kgS_AwuH0), rather than rules.


As of today, September 10th, having the courage to weigh myself, I am now 220lbs. 


Two and a half months, down 25 pounds. Feels good guys.


Keto didn't teach me a diet, it taught me a lifestyle.

A couple of years ago I was at my heaviest, about 215 lbs, and at only 5'2"" firmly in the ""obese"" category.  I was really unhappy, and finally decided to do something about it.  I managed to get myself down to 190 lbs through the C25K program and pretty severe calorie restriction.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get any more weight to come off, no matter how much I ran or how little I ate.  So I gave up and just decided to maintain.

Then I started having health problems, painful and irregular periods even while on hormonal birth control, and I suddenly developed severe migraines.  It took a while to get to the bottom of things, but in August of 2012 I was finally diagnosed with [PCOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome).  My doctor suggested a high protein, low carbohydrate diet to help manage my symptoms and lose weight.  I started keto that week.

I'm now 5 months in and 33 lbs down :)  I've only had one migraine since starting keto, compared to the 2-3 a week I was having before, and my menstrual cycle seems to be getting back to normal.  I'm now also no longer ""obese"" and just ""overweight"".  I feel so much better and have a lot more energy.  I actually feel good about myself for the first time in a long time

1359978490.0,229,self.keto,17v2g2,"[META][RANT] Sub Rules, Bullying and Bans",280,51,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/17v2g2/metarant_sub_rules_bullying_and_bans/,"Hi Everyone,

***Bans and Bullying***

In the last week I've had a stupid number of personal requests for the lifting of bans. Other than the obvious trolling, I've also had a load of PM's about people bullying other people or people getting bullied. I don't understand why this has recently become such a big problem but it won't be tolerated.

If you're new the community or haven't read the rules in the sidebar yet, let me break it down for you:

* If you continually shit on other members of this sub, you will absolutely be banned. 
* If you scoff at other people's slow progress or mock their efforts, you will be banned. You are the worst of worst. No, your ban will not be lifted. Don't PM us. You are not welcome here.
* Please don't sexualize posts. Sensibilities get hurt and people scream bloody murder about double standards. If you wouldn't say it IRL, don't say it here. Your comment will be removed.
* The mods are not punchbags for your anger, if you treat them as such, you will be cautioned or banned. I'm not losing any more mods.
* If you fly off the handle and resort to name calling or personal attacks in the comments section you will be banned. That's not what this community is about.

So it's pretty simple - if you aren't enjoying the sub and aren't willing to discuss things without throwing the toys out of the pram, please refrain from commenting all. Contributing community members and noobs don't benefit from seeing your temper tantrums. If you prioritize what you get out of the sub over your obligation as a subscriber to nurture, contribute and support, then you're doing it wrong.

Thanks to everyone else who has reported all the spiteful crap in the last week. I'd appreciate it if you didn't PM me in future though, use the report button or message the moderators. It will be resolved much more quickly.

***Tagging and Descriptions***

Could I also remind people to tag their posts correctly with good, descriptive titles - it's been neglected quite a lot recently and it really helps people find things later on. If you're posting some food porn, please include a recipe or details of where the foods were procured.

***Other Keto Subs***

Lastly a friendly reminder that many much more specific subreddits exist to cater for everyone, including (but not limited to):

/r/ketocirclejerk - Exactly what it sounds like. If it's all become to much and you need to commit carbicide...  
/r/ketorage - Almost a circle jerk sub. Keto rage comics, memes and more.  
/r/ketogonewild - If post sexualization is your thing, take it here, away from the main community. [NSFW(L)]  
/r/ketogains - Exercise specific questions. Exercising fasted? Want to build some muscle? Low-carb running questions? Want to know which supplements work? Please post it there. 

Thanks very much for reading

**Bread for Stuffing**

(makes 6 mini buns) which can be made ahead and placed in freezer.

1 1/4 cups almond flour

5 Tablespoons psyllium husk power

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon dehydrated onion flakes

1 tablespoon each pesto and olive tapenade

2 eggs, beaten

1 cup chicken broth brought to a boil

Mix all ingredients in the order they appear. Divide batter among 6 mini loaf pans. Bake @ 350 for 40 minutes.

**Stuffing**

1 Stalk of celery diced

1 small onion chopped fine

butter

1 (8 inch) length of fresh garlic sausage taken out of casing

2 mini buns (above recipe) cut into 1/2 inch cubes

Almond milk

1 Tablespoon dried sage

1 teaspoon dried  savory

salt and pepper to taste

Saute celery and onion in 1 2 Tablespoons butter until soft but not brown. In a large bowl combine the cooked celery and onion along with the butter from the pan. Add the sausage meat, cubed buns and seasonings. Mix well. Add enough almond milk to the mixture just to moisten all the ingredients. 


**Cauliflower Mash**

1 Large head of cauliflower

1/4 cup heavy (whipping) cream

4 Tablespoons butter

1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

1/4 cup cream cheese

salt and pepper to taste

Grated cheddar cheese

4 slices of cooked bacon

Fresh chives

Sour cream (optional topping)

Cut cauliflower, including core into 1 inch pieces. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt lightly. add cauliflower and cook until tender. Drain in colander. With a bowl or small plate press on cauliflower to remove all the water. Toss and repeat this step. Important to get most of the water out.( Note: I use a pressure cooker, less time cooking and its not saturated with water) Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor, and puree. You can mash by hand if you don't have a food processor, but it will be a chunkier texture. In a 2 cup measuring cup add cream, butter, Parmesan and cream cheese. Microwave on medium until the mixture in heated and incorporated. Add to food processor along with salt and pepper. Place in oven proof serving dish. Top with cheddar cheese and bacon. Broil in oven until cheese melts and sprinkle with fresh chives. Pass sour cream for an additional topping.
Note: This can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge. Just reheat in oven after bringing to room temperature. Should only take 20 min.

**128lbs in 12 months!**

Keto has saved my life, or at the very least extended it and made it much more worthwhile.  I could barely walk to the mailbox without being out of breath, today I'm biking to the gym, working out and biking home.  (yes, even on leg day).  I have not been this small since probably 1997 or so.   

I really had no idea what to do, I just continued to add weight and add weight, year after year.   And then, I read an article (on a political site no less) that talked about how the guy was 299lbs and he was not going to go over and he lost 50lbs in 6 months eating bunless burgers, bacon and eggs and meat for dinner.  10lbs a month for a fat guy without doing much work would be great.  The article (which I can't find again) referenced /r/keto and I explored.  Read the FAQ, read links, ordered the books and thought ""oh, what the heck""

I lost 30lbs in the first month.   

Clearly, my body cannot deal with carbs (or grains, i feel so much better since not eating grains, even on a cheat) and without them, I feel full, I feel better, I feel human again.  My blood pressure is in the normal range, the meds are long gone (in fact all meds are gone).  Except for the lack of hair, I feel like I'm in my 20's again.   My energy is back  (who needs to eat? fasting is easy) and i've gone from a 4x shirt to a 1x.   and from a 48 fat jeans (that barely barely barely fit) to the 40's in the picture that are too big and I can actually pull down without unbuttoning.

I stumbled across this sub more or less by accident. Since my early twenties I have been overweight. Not by much. 10-15 kg (20-36 lb). Enough so that I don't feel comfortable and confident in my body but not enough to suffer any severe health effects. On january 14 I started. Now 3.5 months later, at the age of 32, I have reached my goal weight and my BMI is in the normal range. 

Now I feel so much better, look better and cook better that I wonder why I didn't start to take care of my body earlier.

I messaged the moderators and asked them to donate my code to someone in need, and it was very well accepted.  

So I know others here must still have accounts set up for Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc, and occasionally receive freebies to their email.  Go ahead and give away that pizza, you won't miss the carbs, and you'll be helping out someone in need.

3) If you don't have a processor, try a blender or just mince it by hand which could take a while but would probably be worth it.

4) Put about 2 tablespoons of coconut oil (olive oil or butter would probably work) into a pan and head the pan to medium/high.

5) put the cauli-rice in the (large) pan with melted oil/butter and keep fluffing it and turning it every minute or more frequently depending on how hot the pan is.

6) The point is to get the rice cooked to the point that it's a little soft and tender, but not too soft and not to the point that it changes color. It should just barely be turning golden. It's a fine line. The first time I did it it turned out perfect and the second time it was a little underdone but not bad. Also keep tasting it to see what you think. I found that 15 minutes was a good amount of time.

7) After it's cooked put a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar (find the sans sugar variety) with a tsp of low calorie sweetner (erythritol or stevia, 1/2 a tsp if stevia) and a tsp or salt and microwave this mix for 30 seconds. Stir and mix into the rice.

8) Add 2 tablespoons of cream cheese into the cauli-rice and mix well, then refrigerate. This is what will help the rice be 'sticky'. If you want it to be stickier you can always add more cream cheese.

9) After 1/2 an hour or until the rice is cool, mold your rice into the sushezi thing, make an indent with the thingamajigger, and add fish, veggies, you name it. I like smoked salmon, regular salmon, cucumber, and more cream cheese. Use the sushezi to push out the tube of ricey goodness onto the seaweed and sushi mat and roll it up.

Enjoy! Hope this helps. It's so good and sooo keto!

A while back I made sushi for me and my SO (who is vegan, gasp!), one with regular rice, avocado, cucumber, carrots and sriracha, and a super keto one for me! I felt like a sushi goddess that night...

WARNING: wall of text inside.,266,49,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/t3ikb/nsvsvlife_victory_100lbs_lost_warning_wall_of/,"Hello all. I've been a lurker for a while now. Thought I would report in. It all started when I graduated college in the fall of 2009. I was around 325lbs 

After 18 months of no longer eating the way I did in college mixed with working out every day I was down to 280. I was really happy about this because at the time I though I was doing everything correctly.... 

I injured myself lifting and had to take some time off from exercise. Keeping the same diet (SAD) I noticed I started to gain the weight back. After some digging in /r/fitness I found people talking about this Keto diet. 

In Oct 2011 I started my Keto journey. I had a starting weight of 292lbs. My blood pressure was high. I was depressed and hated everything. I believe I may have been pre diabetic. I didn't sleep well and energy was almost always low. I wanted to sleep after any heavy meal (full of heart healthy whole grains of course). I wore a XXL shirt and had a 48"" waist. I was miserable. Thanks to this video [The food revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FSeSTq-N4U4) and www.dietdoctor.com I was convinced this was the correct way to eat. Also read Why We Get Fat? and watched Fat Head. These made me look at science more than what stupid fitness experts were saying.

[Pic of me in March 2010](http://i.imgur.com/8zVNa.jpg) 

Since then I can report I sleep like a baby. My blood pressure is normal. I weight 223.4 lbs as of today. I am no longer hungry all the time and I have so much energy. The energy is the thing I am most excited about. I am always looking for something to do now. It's so weird and awesome at the same time. My waist is back to a size 38"", the size I wore in high school. I read lots of different blogs and books on nutrition. I got my start with real weight loss in /r/keto but I eat a more paleo diet now. 

[Pic of me in March 2012](http://i.imgur.com/jr5Ey.jpg)

[Pic of me as of Monday April 30th](http://i.imgur.com/D0rTv.jpg)

Also my parents now are on the Paleo diet. My father has MS, is over weight and has high blood pressure. After my success and all the science I have passed their way about keto / paleo and how it can really help people with MS, they started. My father has lost about 20 lbs since he started the diet and is reporting higher energy levels. He is walking better also and has more strength.

So this is just a big thanks to everyone who post here and helped me get my shit together and get healthy. Have another 25lbs or so to go but the hardest part is over.

(I'm cross posting from r/paleo),253,39,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/pjfyh/thanks_from_an_md_im_cross_posting_from_rpaleo/,"As an MD I feel as lied to and as outraged at the lies as any of you. Perhaps more so. I've spent $420,000 in education just to be taught the WRONG thing. I've been trained to think of obese people as lazy, gluttonous liars. I've been brainwashed into thinking statins are wonder drugs.

This was fine until I became obese and couldn't lose the weight by exercise or diet restriction. Something was OBVIOUSLY wrong. I was an athlete for crying out loud. My own MD tried to put me on statins. My Triglycerides were over 300 and my HDL was under 40. I was 35.

It isn't that MD's don't get the biochemistry. Trust me, if there is one thing we get it's biochemistry. Hell, my degree was in analytic biochemistry.

I've been trained to be some semblance of a respectable authority on peoples health. I am (or was )a liar made legitimate by virtue of a degree. I should have listened to my mother when all she served was meat, organ meat, veggies, and a little rice.

Rest assured. ALL MD's are not fools who are unwilling to step back and reassess. The evidence is building and the tide is beginning to turn. I fear that until the NIH begins to fund research in the area of grain elimination and higher fat eating habits the general public will still think that fat is bad.

FYI I just realized this about 1 month ago when I was researching diets incorporating (whatever the cereal which compares itself with an egg is). I was directed to this sub-reddit by google and someone ranting about the evils of grains and etc. So I looked up paleo and read Sisson and Cordain. Then I read ""Wheat Belly"". I was still wrestling with the amount of fat in the diet. Then I got a hold of Taubes which blew my mind. Then I watched the video about fructose and HFCS [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM)

My fiancee is pissed at me because she loves her sweets. The other MD's I work worth are leery of me although they have commented about my ""wasting away to nothing."" I've lost 30 lbs in month on grass fed beef and buffalo, fish, nuts, eggs, pork belly, and veggies.

So thank you for vociferously expounding on the evils of whole grains. Thank you for not shutting up and listening to nay-sayers and experts.

EDIT 1: I am not saying that appropriate drugs do not have their place or that they cannot be beneficial. I'm saying that preventing disease is much preferable to treating disease.

EDIT 2: I'm not sorry for being a doctor. I just wish the entire system understood the ramifications of their diet recommendations and the science behind them.

EDIT 3: GO GIANTS!!

Keto isn't about fake bread and cakes. It's not about low-carb wraps and muffins and diet sodas. It's about eating differently than we used to.

I understand that we all have a sweet tooth and we need to satisfy that on occasion. But, seriously -- we're not overcoming the addiction by substitution.

When keto started, it was meat and veggies. Now it's like, half meat, half Oopsie rolls, and Dr. Pepper 10, and Atkins Advantage bars, and low-carb sweets. What the hell happened?

I know I'm not the ruler of the keto world, but if I could fix it up, here's what I'd say: Eat real food! That's what this is all about! Eat plants and animals, and stop eating so much damn fake-ass food. I don't care if you can drink 10 litres of Coke Zero, and have it fit into your 20g/day limit. That doesn't make it healthy. That doesn't correct the carb addiction.

Anyway.. I get that this isn't gonna change anything. I get that a bunch of people are gonna be like 'Ugh, this guy is a loser'. But I hope that it reaches someone.

In fact, maybe I'm completely wrong. Maybe everyone's just enjoying these things in moderation. But just, with all the damn posts about keto cake and stuff, it seems like that's all we're eating. All things in moderation, folks. Please don't make this stuff the majority of your diet. Back to basics. Meat and veggies, with the occasional low-carb treat.

Sorry for bitching, and thanks for listening.

I know I posted an update not long ago but I'm so excited and I have no one to share it with, at least no one who would understand!!

I went shopping with my friend today to find a dress for her Hen's night soon. I told her I didn't want a ""fat girls"" dress, I want something that shows myself how far I've come. She kept taking me into shops that made me feel uncomfortable and I kept saying no to everything she picked up because I figured I wouldn't fit into them. She kept saying, yes you will, you are small now... But in my head I feel it's mocking. (I'm working on my body issues!). 

Anyway we walk past a store that I used to shop at which is size 14-26, so it's tailored for bigger women. I said to my friend ""alright, I'll go in here because I obviously feel too fat for everywhere else"". She told me to take a deep breath and we went in.

Looking through all the dresses, I realised how small I really am now and all of a sudden felt uncomfortable being in there, when my friend came up to me with this black lace number and I fell in love! It's what I want, I want my legs and chest to show.

I kept telling her I won't fit in the small, get the medium. So I tried the medium on, and looked in the mirror with shock, TOO BIG! Alright I said, ill try the small. So I slid the small on and was confused, ""why is it bigger?"" I asked my friend. She said, ""I made you put the small on first as a test, so you can see how you actually are smaller than you think."".

I began crying, I took the dress off and just cried. My friend ended up coming in the change room, hugged me and said, ""Now put the XS on."".

I put it on and it fit like a glove. I cried again. The XS is a equivalent size 14 and the smallest size they carry, and I know in a couple of months I won't be able to shop there ever again, and that makes me so happy!

This moment has been THE changing moment from transition of a large person to an average size. She did a great thing for me today. I just want to shout out to the world, IM SO HAPPY!!!!!

Welcome to our community and welcome to changing your life. I wish you all the best! However, there are a few things that have been bothering me lately about some of the posts in this subreddit. Im not trying to judge, Im just trying to spread some knowledge. 

I keep seeing posts concerning people who have only been on the diet less than a month (or sometimes only a week) and they are talking about stalls and plateaus. I know that if you have been lurking here awhile that keto might seem like a miracle cure, but its really not. Anyone should know that weight doesnt usually fall off. And, if you read the FAQ's and Keto in a Nutshell like we constantly encourage, then you would know about PISS and how a plateau isnt really a plateau until several weeks have gone by. In addition, the resources in r/keto talk about the various ways to combat a stall/plateau.

Ultimately though, the key is patience. Not everyday will be a victory and not everyday will be easy. Realize that this is a lifechange and  your body needs time to adapt. Im reading the same posts every day about this. 

We are here to help, and we want to share in your success, but please use reason before you post the same thing day in and day out. Ask yourself how long you have been in keto, are you tracking to the letter, did you cheat, calorie deficit, etc? If you take the time out to do this, then you can probably answer your own questions about plateaus. 

Once again, I really want the best for you guys. r/keto has been a wonderful resource for me and a great tool for motivation and inspiration. If you still feel like you need to post about the same thing every day so be it. Just wanted to help a few people.

I started Keto on December 5th 2011. As of today I have lost a total of 47 pounds, and I hit my first weight loss goal, which was to be under 200 pounds! I haven't been under 200 pounds in over 5 years. It feels awesome. For reference purposes, I am 5'5 and I started out at 246 pounds. I've had a pretty horrible binge eating problem my whole life so my weight has always been pretty out of control, and I've had a hard time sticking to something long enough to make any progress. I am very happy to say that Keto has helped me completely kick my binge eating problem, and is slowly helping me look the way  I want to. I would still like to lose another 40-50 pounds, so I have a ways to go, but I am so very thankful that I found this subreddit, and read that FAQ 5 months ago. I plan to be a lifetime Keto-er.

The number surprised me, so I stepped off, and did it again. And again. 260.5. Then I spent the next 30 minutes not knowing what to do with myself (and was late for work as a result). 

Yesterday, I spent the day at the beach, beach combed with the kids, ran a foot race with my oldest - almost caught him (ten year olds can be speedy little buggers). Swam a little in the ocean (still a little cool up in these parts). Still had energy to spare when we headed back to the car. What a change from last year, in which I would have plunked myself on a towel and ate chips, cookies, and drank pop while the kids played by themselves.

I won't quite hit the goal I had in mind for my 45th birthday next month (although I'll get close). But, seriously, I had no idea I would feel this good with those 100 pounds gone. And, while I have more to go, most of the weight I had to lose, I have lost. 

I will celebrate with bacon. And raise a glass (of water) to all my fellow ketoers who have inspired me over, and over, and over again. Stay strong. Keto on.

PS Obligatory photo of me holding 100 pounds of something will follow. We don't have a Costco here, so I'm not sure where to get the two 50 pound bags of flour or sugar. I'll figure something out.

the reason many of us have gained so much weight is because we were eating all this processed, food-out-of-a-factory bullshit. all the cookies, all the candy bars, the corn syrup. once we got on keto, we cut all that shit out of our lives and became better for it.

now i read /r/keto and it's all about ~~""1 carb bread!"" this or~~ ""low-carb chocolate sundae"" this and that. come on guys, what happened to eating real food? why are we supplementing this great way of living with frankenfoods and chemistry-lab monstrosities? why are we giving up, true, honest-to-goodness food for chemical concoctions and bread that can do your dishes?

if you want a chocolate sundae - eat a chocolate sundae. just eat it occasionally. if you want bread, eat a slice of bread. hell, i bake sourdough bread from scratch on a monthly basis - and it's AMAZING. i'll be damned if i give up that crust with a complex crumb for a $8 loaf of this bread-like concoction. i just don't eat the entire loaf.

i know this will be an unpopular opinion, and won't see nearly as many upvotes as keto chocolate fudge brownies, but i'm going to make a stand. i know it's hard to give up the foods that you once loved to eat on a regular basis, but replacing two cups of sugar for two cups of splenda isn't really that much of a better trade, and i don't mean just nutritionally. 

worse still, you're giving up one of the biggest benefits of keto - an increase in self-discipline and self-control. we're just replacing one vice for another.

**EDIT: Thanks for the gold, anonymous redditors! This wasn't an easy thread to ride through, but I stuck by my guns, and I'll have it no other way. I expect you are just as uncompromising, and I salute you!**

My life was not a simple fun trip as of yet, it as been alot of stress and in such had caused me to develop poor eating habbits, often indulging heavily into carbs of all spectrums, pizza, candy, pop. All of it in mass, until I was sick, to replace the real feelings I had. I had hurt my knee in the last few years twice and the last time being this last Summer, it was to be the last straw for me, I had always had a mind set I can be a fat man as long as it doesnt get in my way. Well, this was a horrid mind set to have and it allowed me to reach a critical point at 26. I was 406 pound, injured, alone, fat, depressed, jobless and ready to end my life. Here I am a year later, thanks to my friends and family cheering me on I have been able to drive forward for the first time in my life of chain dieting since I was 12, I am losing weight and loving every moment of it.

At 21 years old, I was not happy with the way I looked and knew I had to do something about it. Throughout high school and college, I kept telling myself that I would never allow my weight to hit 300, and if it ever did, I would do something about it. But that would never happen right? I'm only 240...250...275....300. Damn... I never outwardly expressed any dissatisfaction with my weight, always shrugging it off and making jokes. But I guess in reality, it did bother me a bit. I was tired of being the fat kid who couldn't run for more than 2 minutes at a time, or the kid who was always passed over in sports because of how he looked, instead of his ability. (Does that mean I'm good at sports and was overlooked because I was fat, or that I would rather be judged by my lack of ability than my weight)? Something had to change.

When browsing around /r/loseit one day, I found a link to /r/keto. Seemed like a lot of people were having amazing results with it, so I decided to check it out. As I read about what keto was, I thought it was some kind of joke. Lose weight eating fat? That's ridiculous. Every one knows you can't lose weight by eating fat. Eating fat makes you fat! Slowly, I began to see what was actually going on. I understood the thought process and the basic biochemistry behind what keto was. After three months of lurking and accruing information, I finally started keto. Throughout the year, I have visited this subreddit almost daily looking for posts with new information, videos, or motivation. I have learned so much about nutrition and how the body works and feel confident in the choices I make. I have watched countless hours of lectures, presentations, and documentaries, and I've read several books on keto. I definitely think that this is going to be a lifelong learning process for me.

So here I am today, one year after my first “weight loss” omelet with sausage bacon and cheese, and what do I have to show for it? A lot actually. I have lost 110lb so far;  from 300lb to 190lb. I went from wearing size 46 pants to size 32. I went from XXL shirts, to M. I went from feeling like shit during the day, to feeling the best I've ever felt. I went from being hungry every hour, to eating twice a day. I went from an elevated blood pressure, to a normal blood pressure. Most importantly, My self esteem went up. I no longer care if people judge me because I know that I'm doing something to improve who I am.

This is definitely still a work in progress though. I still have some more weight to lose, and I'm still struggling with the mental aspect of weight loss (still have the “fat guy” mentality). It's been a great year for me and I'm extremely lucky that I found /r/keto. Thank you for everything.

Well, that went on longer than I expected. Thanks for reading if you did, and I don't blame you if you didn't.

I guess I should probably post pictures or something, huh?

I started Keto December 5th, 2011, so I have been going pretty strong for about 9 months now. I have made a lot of progress, and I wanted to show how far I've come. The last time I posted was when I hit under 200 pounds, but I've lost about 24 more pounds and I'm getting very close to my goal weight. 

Some stats:

* I'm 5'5 and I'm currently 175 pounds.

* My waist has went from 39 inches to 32 inches.

* My hips went from 51 inches to 42 inches.

* My chest went from 47 inches to 42 inches.

* At my heaviest weight I was wearing around a size 18/20 in jeans and now I wear around a 12/14.

* My BMI went from 40.9 to 29.1 ! ( I am no longer considered obese according to BMI)


I have been pretty strict with what I eat, although I pretty much stopped tracking my calories and food a long time ago. I mostly just pay very close attention to carbs, and I usually eat waaayy under 20, but sometimes I eat up to 80. I also make sure that I have fat with everything I eat and drink. Coffee gets heavy cream, and my broccoli gets lots of butter. I love staying full. I do not exercise, unless shopping counts. I'm currently at a sort of plateau though, so I intend to add some exercise and maybe some intermittent fasting. 

Keto has helped me get so close to my goal, and it has helped me kick my binge eating problem. My self confidence has improved a tiny bit, but that is mostly because I get a lot more positive attention now. I used to fear that people only noticed me because I was fat, but now I feel like people notice me because I have a nice curvy figure, and a cute face. I love this community and it has been such a blessing to me. I hope this inspires someone to keep going. I want to lose around 20 more pounds and I want all of you here to do it with me. :D Thank you r/keto.
