* Condoms are far cheaper than child support
* Hold your breath to quickly deflate a boner
* Never trust a fart in public or in the company of a pretty lady. Not even once
* Shaving your balls is much easier when you have a hard one
* After you get the spare tire on, there's still a chance that your spare is flat or close to flat as well, since it's been sitting in your trunk for a long time. However, the mechanic you take your dead tire to can fill it up for free if you just ask
* Keep a small trashcan in your bathroom for ladies you have over
* Do you tend to get sweaty on your morning commute via public transportation or walking? Don't put on your tie until you get to your office building. Do it in a restroom and use the chance to run a comb through your hair. Your shirt collar will stay cleaner, too
* You never know when you'll need a change of clothes at the office. It's wise to keep a spare shirt, belt, and/or shoes in your desk
* Buy high quality tools, and you'll only have to buy them once.
* Learn how to do brake jobs and you'll save yourself a shit-load of money over the course of your life.
* Have a small allotment of your check automatically go to a savings account you can't touch (easily) and forget about it until an emergency comes up.
* Don't make long term decisions based on short term problems.
* Never hit any woman.
* Call your mom and dad every week.
* Don't try to shave your balls with an electric razor.
* Don't ignore severe back pain, it almost never makes it better
* Always have a couple presents for your SO ready - buy them whenever you find them, stash them somewhere. Then, you don't need to run around pressed for time when the next birthday/anniversary/etc comes up
* Anything you do, do it properly. Don't half arse anything...   Especially fucking your woman
* Dress nicely. A good suit might cost you $400, but everyone looks good in one, and when you look good, you feel good. It's a great confidence booster. Have one black, formal suit and one lighter, more casual suit that can double as a sports coat. Match shoes to belt and socks to pants. Never wear brown shoes with black pants
* Avoid conversational narcissism. Ask more than you answer. If you find another person who does the same, you end up with a perfect give and take in conversation
* Establish rapport. Everyone is a friend you're about to make, treat them as such. I'm a very introverted guy, but overcoming that mental barrier isn't impossible, or even terribly difficult. Just forget that they're a stranger and treat them like any other friend
* Keep a Leatherman on your person (not with a suit)
* Don't get emotional about shit
* Exercise, lift weights, RUN. Anyone, even the happiest person on earth would be happier if they were in shape. Being strong is a great feeling, don't give excuses like ""I'm happy with myself as I am."" That's called complacency, always strive to be better, stronger, faster, smarter
* Buy a styptic pencil, use it well. If you nick yourself shaving before a job interview, a date, a funeral, a wedding... it cleans up the spot
* Never let a woman see you worry. ~Frank Sinatra
* Don't boast about anything you have done, but don't sell yourself short. Make your personal accomplishments more into entertaining anecdotes rather than drawn out epics
* When nature bestows upon you a precipitation free sunny day, you shall forget inside cooking, and cook outside, you shall cook meat and meat alone, any vegetables shall only be prepared to make the meat taste meatier
* Learn how clothes are supposed to fit and find yourself a nice tailor. And your $1000 wardrobe can be made to look like a $5000 one for a few bucks (but never buy expensive clothes for the price, always find a cheaper deal, it's there somewhere)
* Knowing HOW to dress is a lot more important than where you buy your clothes
* Always listen to your woman, even if you don't agree with what they're saying, and even if you don't do it. Your life will be easier, happier
* Know something about wine. You don't have to be a sommelier but you should be able to order a bottle for the table with confidence
* Make sure your fingernails are clean and trimmed before you go out, ladies will always check this
* ""Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money."" Arthur Miller
* It’s amazing what you can accomplish just by asking. 
* Never straighten another man's tie
* ""The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.""  - Groucho Marx
* You never miss a practice, and I'll never miss a game.
* Never turn down a breathmint
* don't get drunker than the boss
* never shake a man's hand sitting down
* don't miss the team photo
* the man at the grill is the closest thing we have to a king, fetch him a beer
* in a negotiation never make the first offer
* never cancel dinner plans by text message
* don't knock it till you try it.
* take her to paris
* request the late checkout
* trust but verify. - r. reagan
* love the one your with
* return a lost wallet, with everything that was in it.
* nobody's perfect
* don't lie to your doctor
* all guns are loaded
* pace yourself
* expect people to realize the obvious
* keep shaving razor blades sharp by running them along a piece of old jean denim.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_12f3ve,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/12f3ve/compiled_list_of_useful_info_mostly_from_reddit/,

The gentleman does not needlessly and unnecessarily remind an offender of a wrong he may have committed against him.

1374366701.0,314,self.everymanshouldknow,1iq33z,EMSK: How to drink like an adult,493,179,215,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iq33z/emsk_how_to_drink_like_an_adult/,"Drinking properly in all situations is something that most people don't know how to do. Most of my friends are in their early 20's and tend to get really awkward when drinking with adults. It is awkward at first, but it is necessary if you expect people to take you seriously. So here we go:

* **Learn to drink and appreciate the basic drinks** - This includes beer, wine, and whiskey. You may not like them at first, but they are all acquired tastes and you will get used to them. When your boss, friend, future father-in-law offers you a glass of nice wine, scotch, or beer, you will not want to have to say no and look weird. So start drinking, you may not love it, but you'll be thankful that you got used to it. Their is no way around this one, just toughen up and get used to it, these are the most common drinks.

* **Have a (few) ""usual(s)""** - find a drink which you enjoy drinking and that is easy for a bartender to make (ex. whiskey coke, rum coke, long island, etc.). Don't be the guy that stands at the bar not knowing what he wants and having everyone wait on him. You don't have to drink this every time, just know it to be ready if you have to make a quick decision. 

* **Have a ""usual"" beer for every occasion** - feel out the situation you are in. If you are at a dive bar and the only things that they have are domestic drafts, be ready to pick one at the drop of a hat. You may not like cheap beer, but if the situation calls for it, know which one you like best (for me, it is Coors Light, it might not be the best beer, however, I never hesitate when there is a crowded bar and the bartender plus half the bar is waiting for me to make a decision. If the situation calls for nicer beer (e.g. draft houses, specialty beer bars, nicer places) know what kind of beer you like and (if the situation permits) ask the bartender which of that kind they recommend (if they work there, they like beer). Personally, I hate IPA's but I love blondes, so I usually just ask which is the best blonde they have. It is also a good idea to know a few that you like off the top of your head (I like 312, Shiner, Krokenberg, and Stongbow [I know it is not beer, but they sell it like a beer]). No need to be a connoisseur to know what you like. P.S. If you are trying to save money and you want cheep beer, you have 2 options: 1) if the bar is not too busy, ask about drink specials, they will usually have a beer there, 2) if the bar is busy, domestic drafts are usually the cheapest (Coors, Miller, Bud, etc.). You shouldn't ask ""what's the cheapest beer you got?"" You will more often than not get an eye roll followed by shitty service.

* **Don't be scared to order what another is having** - If you are in a situation where you don't know what to drink and you don't want to make a fool of yourself, don't be scared to copy what the first person asked for. It makes them feel like they are a trend setter and it takes away the hassle of guessing what others will think of you when you order a drink. You don't want to be the guy who orders Blue Label when everyone else gets Jack and Coke. If you don't like what the first person got, then just fall back on your usual, that's why you have one, or maybe even go with what's on special. 

* **Tipping** - Don't be a douche. I usually like opening a tab, cause that allows me to tip all at once. It is a little bit more of a hassle than cash, but I end up keeping better tabs on drinks and tips. If paying cash, tip at least $1 a drink (depending on the cost of the drink and the niceness of the place). After you get the change, just leave it next to your spot or where the bartender gave you the change. They may not act like they notice... but they do. Remember, if you tip well, the bartender will make stronger drinks. If you are worried about the bartender cheeping out on drink strength, remember that beer can't be watered down. P.S. in my experience, I like having guy bartenders. Tipping them well works better because women expect better tips, and guys are usually much more grateful about better tips.

* **Know your limits** - This might sound a little churchy and ""alcohol EDU""-ish, but it is true. Know how many it takes you to get tipsy (on a full AND empty stomach). Know how many until you are drunk. Know when it is ok for you to get drunk and for you to get tipsy. You might be ok with being shitfaced in front of your friends, not so much in a company diner. Know how many until you hit .08 BAC. I would NEVER condone drinking and driving, however, this is real life and there will come a situation in which it is inevitable. .08 is MUCH easier to get to than you expect, know how much you can take before hitting it. Buy a breathalyzer if you must or use a [chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content) and undershoot. **A DUI is always much more expensive than a cab.** Most bars will allow you to keep your car overnight without towing it. 

This is not an all inclusive list, but it is a good start. Experience will be the best teacher. Maybe go out by yourself or with a close friend to a local bar and try new drinks. Ask the bartenders (if the bar is not too busy) about different kinds of liquors and beers. They are usually fairly knowledgeable and happy to help.

 It is painfully obvious when you are drinking with someone who has no clue how to drink. It is also very embarrassing to be the odd man out when in a group. A little practice is well worth not being that guy.

EDIT 1:

I'm glad a lot of you like what I wrote and others are discussing it. I like getting people to talk and analyze, even if they don't agree with me. A few clarifications that I think need to be made after reading through the comments:

Clarification 1: By no means am I saying that not drinking is off the table. I saw that some people were concerned about this in the comments and I want to clear up that not drinking is completely fine. After seeing this, I decided to ask a few of my friends who don't drink for advice on how they handle this (as I don't feel that I would be qualified to put my two cents in). They told me that they usually do one of two things: 1) if the situation doesn't promote good, meaningful conversations (e.g. loud bar, big group, meeting strangers) then they usually just come up with an excuse for that one time. Anything from driving to ""not feeling it."" 2) if in a more intimate environment (e.g. smaller group of friends, lounge place with low music, outdoors) then they usually say that they don't drink. Both the guys I asked told me that if you do chose to say that you don't drink, be prepared to respond to ""why?"". It is not fair or right that people have to give excuses, but sadly, that's how things are. Hope that helps. 

Clarification 2: My suggestion of not being scared of ordering what another is ordering is more for when you find yourself in a foreign situation. My best example (and the reason I've put this rule on myself) is when you go to a bar that probably doesn't have your ""regular"" drink (e.g. hole in the wall bars, traveling abroad). I have had many times where, when traveling, I learned so much more and got to taste some pretty amazing drinks because I just asked whomever I was with what they were having. This suggestion is more of a ""don't be scared to get out of your comfort zone."" I hope this helped clarify this too.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,1374516039.0,,,True,t3_1iq33z,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iq33z/emsk_how_to_drink_like_an_adult/,

Learning how to dance will build your confidence, leadership, ability to talk to women, social skills, coordination, keep you fit and so much more.  Not to mention that at some point you are going to be put into a situation where knowing how to dance will be vital; weddings, parties, social functions, ect. 

The key to dancing well is being confident and having fun. However, those two simple things are going to be incredibly hard if you have never practiced before. The great thing about dancing is once you learn how to listen for and move to the rhythm you can use the moves you learn from any dance style in most others.
You can either practice in private.  I am going to be providing links for learning how to do the salsa, east coast swing, and traditional two-step.  However you can also see if there is a dance club/saloon/bar in your town.  Many will offer free beginner's lesson nights, and they will meet regularly.

Dancing is kind of like playing with legos.  You can take any of your basic pieces (moves) and combined them with just about any other piece (move).  Furthermore, don’t force your lego pieces (moves) together, they should fit together easily and feel natural during assembly.  My last piece of advice is that you have to own it. Most people have no idea how to dance so if you do your thing with a smile on your face and confidence they will think you are the greatest dancer even if you are messing up. (That last piece of advice works well with other aspects of life too!)",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1hddka,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1hddka/emsk_how_to_dance/,

The article hit on a topic that I feel everyman should be more intentional on carrying out. I think everyone can remember when someone they respected gave them a compliment or said an encouraging word. I can remember receiving a lot of encouraging words growing up, not because I was a great kid or good at anything, but because I had loving parents and a very intentional father. So, pass the compliments on and uplift someone today. You might change someones day and possibly life.

2) I cannot parallel park.

3) I have had people complain that I swerve and make them car-sick. I feel like I am more ""aiming"" my car versus driving it.

Both are fun. Plus, women and gay blokes think **chickens are classy**. 

You'll roast the **chicken** and ravage the body like an animal for one night's meal. The next night you'll have a bunch of leftover meat still on the carcass, tear that shit off and make a **curry, or a chili**, or something like that with the meat. The third night, nothing left? What's on the menu? Fucking **soup**'s on the menu. Now, in the previous two nights you better not have thrown out any bones or skin or gross chicken bits. You keep that shit for your soup ([which I elaborate on here](http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iyrog/emsk_how_to_roast_a_chicken_with_beer/cb9d524)).

Back to the roast:

I'm going to recommend **beer** can chicken because it's easy, delicious, as well as manly. But you can make your chicken however you prefer, apparently some people think this is a sham, I can't testify to the thermodynamics of cooking, all I know is this makes a mean chicken. 

Here's how it plays out: 

* Put the oven on like 350 F

* Get your chicken and wash it off and get any gross bits out of it

* Cover the chicken in whatever the fuck you want and massage that into the raw chicken's creepy skin. Salt, pepper, and garlic will do, but I'm recommending dousing it in cajun spice which you can buy or [make easily](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cajun-spice-mix-2/) (basically just throw spoonful of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cyanne pepper, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper together)

* Empty about a third of a beer can into a bowl. Or drink it. And plop the beer can on a baking tray, now, without spilling the beer, put your chicken down on the can and shove the can up it's ass. Think of that south park episode when Mr. Slave sits on that horrible celebrity until she's up his ass. I love chicken skin (especially in cajun spice), and one of the good things about this method is that all of the skin gets nicely evenly roasted if it's sitting up, as oppose only one side like when you lay it down as you usually do. 

* Throw some cut up garlic down the chicken's open neck hole and see if you can use the skin cover the hole so it all hotboxes in there. You might have to sew it back using something. 

* Put it in the oven for an hour and think about how awesome it's going to be. 

* Come back after an hour and throw some potatoes, carrots, yams, and onion quarters in with the chicken on the tray. It's better if it's a bowl-like tray so the veggies roll around in all the juices/beer. Also, if you didn't drink the beer, dump that beer on the chicken now.

* Come back after another hour and pull it out of the oven. *Do not touch it.* Don't you fucking touch it. Or pick at it. Or peel at it. Just let it sit there for 10 minutes. Eat a potato if you want. 

* Alright, the beer can's going to be hot as hell, so try shaking it out of the chicken into a garbage or get something to pull it out while you hold it up or something. Try not to spill it, but if you do it's really no big deal, you just get an extra-beery gravy along with your veggies. 

* Eat it all AND DON'T LOSE ANY OF THE BONES. Those are for soup.

Now invite a lovebuddy over for dinner and make 'em a fucking roast chicken. 

I know picking up a full chicken isn't the cheapest thing, but seriously, it'll cover you for three full meals, not just the one. 

**tl;dr** Put a chicken in an oven. If you roast a chicken, you get meals for three days by going Roast -&gt; Leftover chicken for curry -&gt; Leftover carcass for soup, or get to just feed off it for a couple days like our ancestors.

1352946833.0,200,self.everymanshouldknow,137una,EMSK: Items to keep in your vehicle at all times [fixed],235,35,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/137una/emsk_items_to_keep_in_your_vehicle_at_all_times/,"I personally found that the advice given in the link of the original post to be lacking, so I fixed it. I've broken it down the most logical way I could think of, and remember not everyone will need everything. This post will require a *little* bit of common sense, for example if your rarely travel outside an urban area, you probably won't need to bother with the Emergency  Kit; however someone who frequently travels remote rural areas or the back country would most likely be better off keeping one in the trunk. Also, as far as the Tool and First Aid Kits go, these are just examples of **basic** contents. You can certainly add more items to it, but in general, I probably wouldn't take anything away. Keep in mind also that, unless you truly are the Forever Alone Guy, you will need to consider passengers and any unique needs they may have. For example if your wife/girlfriend whoever is has allergies, it wouldn't hurt to throw in some benadrly or even an epi-pen if it's severe. 

**BASIC TOOL KIT**

I doesn't have to be anything major or expensive. All you need is a sturdy container with the following contents inside:

Socket set/ratchet, flat head screw drivers: 3/16, ¼ and 5/16, Philips size #1 and #2, pair of regular slip joint pliers and a pair of needle-nose and locking pliers, adjustable crescent wrench, wire cutters/stripper, hammer, an assortment of extra fuses, heavy duty jumper cables, gloves, a couple of shop towels and I usually have a roll of electrical tape in there as well.

**BASIC FIRST AID KIT**

Again, it doesn't have to be a giant, store-bought monstrosity. I would personally suggest getting a small Pelican type case that is crush proof and water tight and filling it with your own supplies. If you're a father/husband/good guy and you make multiple kits it's easier and cheaper than buying what is typically an overpriced and poor quality store bought kit. If you live/travel out in BFE and utilize an Emergency Kit, I'd make sure the First Aid Kit is small enough to toss in it without too much trouble. Anyway at a minimum, I would include:

Bandages (assorted Band-Aid type), gauze, gauze pads, antibiotic ointment, scissors, first aid tape, tweezers, alcohol swabs, elastic bandage, instant cold pack, pain relievers and burn ointment.

Here is a particularly good opportunity to show your good judgement, foresight and common sense. For example, my son suffers from bad acid reflux, so I would include some antacid. If you're trained in emergency medical or whatever, by all means add more stuff to utilize your abilities. Maybe you're ok but someone else needs help, be a Good Guy.

**Emergency Kit**

Not everyone will need this. This is mostly for people to take long trips or those who live out in the middle of nowhere. Again, this is just a basic idea, take it and expand it to fit your area and needs. I would put the following items in a Camelbak type bag, that way you have a convenient way to carry the items and water.

550 Cord, duck tape, space blanket, food stuffs, poncho, signaling mirror/whistle, fire starting
Material, signaling flares, signaling panel (VS17), dry socks and sturdy footwear, good fixed blade knife.

**In the Trunk/Cargo Area**

Put whatever kits above you use and the following: A real jack, lug wrench/tire iron, a quart of oil, a gallon of antifreeze/coolant, folding shovel, can of Fix-a-Flat, empty fuel can, large water container-full of fresh water (for drinking-fill your Camelbak with it if you use it). 

**In the Center Console/Glovebox**

This items you will want to be able to reach from the driver's seat:

Emergency Egress Tool, a bright, compact flashlight, map. Also, a bottle of Acqua Di Gio (or at least a thing of Axe) and a pack of gum, because this post isn't about survival as it about what Men should have in their vehicle.

On a similar note, fellas, don't be that guy that comes into work the next day smelling like lavender and coconut and wearing the same thing you wore the day before. You know what I'm talking about: You end up at an impromptu stay over and end up showering with whatever girly crap she has in her shower and wearing the same thing to work you wore the day before because you didn't have time to return to the Bat Cave before work. I recommend -at least- having an extra shave kit with an extra toothbrush/toothpaste, razor/gel, deo and whatever Manly Soap you use. Putting this in a gym bag with an extra set of clean whatever-you-wear-to-work would be ideal.

Finally, I didn't include stupid stuff that everyone already has in their vehicle like a car charger for their phones and whatnot. I hope this is more helpful than the original version posted earlier. I would also like to say I did not make this to be a dick, I just thought it wasn't very helpful and wanted to improve on the idea.

Generally speaking 5-10 minutes per side depending on the heat and the way you like your meat cooked (medium rare, well done etc.) You can use charcoal (briquets) or gas in this situation although generally speaking gas is much more efficient especially if only for a small number of people (personally I still feel that charcoal gives a better flavor even if it is more inconvenient in this situation). If you are cooking a large amount of meat the prep time might be a wash for the charcoal.

BBQ is a term used for slow cooking meat (Briskets, ribs, hams) with indirect heat and smoke generated from the use of hard woods (mesquite, hickory, oak, pecan, apple, etc.) or charcoal. Usually a dry rub is used. General rule of thumb is 1 to 1.5 hours per lb of meat for the cook time at 200-225 degrees F. Also I like to put a can of beer (water works too) under the meat I am smoking as it helps to prevent drying out of the meat you are BBQing. 

If you run out of time and need to finish it off quick you can wrap your smoked meat in foil and place it in an oven roaster. Place that in the oven at 350 degrees until cooked (use an oven thermometer).

I reckon I could probably get away with gentle slow dancing at a prom with my girlfriend if I had to, but other than that, the most I can achieve is headbanging and air guitar. 

So my fellow men, how do I dance? Ballroom? Freestyle? Anything that could be used in general at parties or possibly clubs, as well as proms and formals.

Anything would help really. Lessons are currently out of the question (unless they are online tutorials) due to lack of funds &amp;amp; time. Youtube video links or some tips/moves that will make me resemble a monkey having a fit slightly less would be most welcome. 

Thanks.

She informed me that mass produced clothing are very often cut in huge stacks. This causes a slight difference in the cut fabric. Try cutting a stack of paper on a paper cutter, you will see they get cut at a slight angle.

2. Remember they are helping you out so make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Accommodate them as much as possible. Your friend is helping you move but he doesn't have a car? Go pick him/her up and drive back to your place, don't make them bike or take a bus.

3. Be ready to start when you say you are going to start. If you get your friend to help you paint your living room and say Sat. at 2 pm be ready to roll at 1:30. Don't get out of bed at 2pm half hungover and go down to the hardware store to pick up the brushes and paint. 

4. Try to pay them back in some small fashion right then and there. After they help you move into your new place/paint the room invite them to stay and spring for the pizza and beer.

It can save you your security deposit or the cost of having a professional come to accomplish an easy task.  

You'll need:
Drywall tape (repair type, fiber, open pored)
A sanding pad (open pore, looks like screen material)
Drywall mud (light and heavy for larger holes, just light for smaller repair)
Dust mask
A small trowel
A larger trowel
Texturing sponge (if necessary)
Utility knife
Gloves
Goggles or safety glasses

For any hole in drywall it is a good idea to clean up the edges of the hole using a utility knife, remove any damaged remnants of the wound to make certain you have strong edges.

For small holes (fist sized to 2 inches in diameter) I'd recommend using a fiber, open pored self adhesive drywall tape as thin as possible.  Start by covering the hole with the tape and use a small amount of heavy mud to keep the edges down initially.  Once the hole is covered with tape, begin filling in the pores of the tape with heavy mud, take care not to push too hard, the tape needs to stay in place.  Your trowel should be larger than the hole you're repairing.  Once you've got a good base layer on, wait for the mud to dry a bit (edges will start to turn white) then, apply a second, thinner layer of your heavy mud, wait for this to dry a bit more fully.  After over half of the hole has dried to white apply an even coating of the lightweight mud and wait for it to dry completely.  Once dried, it is time to sand, try to avoid heavy repetitive strokes, use a light touch in a circular motion and sand down to near the plane of the wall (this takes practice as you don't want the tape to show through) once sanded you are ready for paint, or if needs be texturing.  To texture the wall, use lightweight drywall mud on the texturing sponge to get the desired effect.  You can bring a sample of the paint on your walls and have it color matched at most hardware stores.  

Gouges and deep scratches require only lightweight mud and a steady hand to repair.  Fill the gouge in multiple stages to prevent cracking of the mud compound, and finish as previously stated.  

Large holes can be conquered as well, but until you've got the grasp of smaller drywall repair, I would recommend using some sort of backer to help keep the tape in place. And maintain the structural integrity of the panel.  

If you aren't pleased with the outcome, you've got time to practice and removing the patch is easy enough.

As always, wear your protective equipment (drywall dust isn't something you should breathe in)

Now I can pass these on to you,  in no particular order

1) Carry a handkerchief 

2) Smell good (a cheaper daily cologne and a nicer,  more expensive evening scent is a great starter. A nice sandal wood or unscented talc to stave off perspiration in more sensitive areas is also a must)

3) Wear a watch,  and don't check your phone impulsively every 10 mins

4) Wear button down shirts and make sure you have some nice cufflinks when you go to work or evening wear 

5) Use moisturizer daily on your face and hands. Seems weird,  but you'll be thankful at 60 when you still look 40. Vaseline make an excellent men's one,  smells amazing (see #2)

6) Invest in some nice leather shoes,  and shoe trees,  and don't kick them off or pull them on without lacing or unlacing.  They'll last a lifetime 

7) Walk with confidence and shoulders back

8) Walk on the outside of her (a bit dated,  but classy.. Falls into the same category as opening the door on your car for a girl first before you go around to open yours. Use sparingly.  Excellent on first dates.) 

9) Wear a hat if you leave the house (again,  dated,  but having a few nice fedoras won't hurt,  and lend to a nice,  unique, personal style) 

10) Be kind to yourself and others.  This one has been huge for me. Seems common sense, but just being actively more aware of this philosophy is an excellent practice ",,False,self,t5_2u82c,1354808267.0,,,True,t3_14dw85,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/14dw85/emsk_top_tips_from_my_grandfather/,

**Edit: I'd prefer to hear some exact advices, without rediracting me to other subreddits.**

**Edit2: Thank you, gentlemen. Somebody asked me to do it, so I summerize all the opinions we've got here:**

0. Do **NOT** touch you face except cases you wash it. Don't you DARE doing it.
1. Changing your pillowcase as well as sheets and towels more often.
2. Body Scrubbers.
3. Drinking a lot of water.
4. Scrubbing-cream(or whatever it is) and moisturizing after it.
5. Go down in shaving stuff (/r/wicked_edge)

And the last one from me: 
7. If you have some long hair, keep them away from face when you are not in public. The less the touch your face - the cleaner it is.

When I first began putting together a portfolio I had no clue where to begin, so I have comprised a short list of informational websites for your own due diligence.

http://finance.yahoo.com/   By far the key for an average investor.  On Yahoo Finance you can set up an account and track your stocks in lists (similar to iTunes playlists) Not only that, but once you've began tracking a stock any relevant information about the stock will be presented to a Top News list on the very same page as your stock lists.

http://www.fool.com/  Need some more insight?  This website allows you to further delve into your stock choices and see professional opinions.  

http://seekingalpha.com/  This site is my bread and butter to stock investing.  It's format is impeccable and it's updates are incredible. 

https://www.merrilledge.com/    You're probably wondering how to even begin an account... well, I started mine through BoA Merrill Edge, which was free to me.  Aka there were no bottom line limits, and the only fees are in buying and selling the stocks.  

To really give ya a head start I'll include some of my high interest stocks for your Yahoo.Finance portfolio.  
* General Electric (GE)
* Ford Motors (F)
* Sprint Nextel (S)
* Wells Fargo (WFC) 
These are some of my favorite stocks, not because I bought them and made money off of them, but because you can relate to them on a consumer level, but appreciate them on a macro level.  

I know this isn't some comprehensive guide to investing, but it's a way to get started.  Remember you must do your own due diligence with stock purchases, no one can tell you how the stock will act and appreciate/depreciate.  You have to find your method for investing and grow from there.

Most of them are useful later in life. I think the most important is how to cook an amazing meal. 

Because you never know when you will meet that incredible lady. The one you pull out all the charm for. Because you feel you are punching above your weight. The one you inevitably want to invite back to your house, but don't want to screw it up. That is where the home cooked meal comes in. If a woman is interested in you, she will never refuse an offer of a meal, cooked by you, at your house. Somehow, watching a man cook in the kitchen is actually sexy to women. I know, doesn't make much sense to me either.

Now the meal can be anything. But it needs to be cooked with expertise. With her watching. While you are entertaining her with small talk. A man who can cook an exceptional meal almost effortlessly, that man can accomplish anything. But that means practice. Cooking the same meal again, and again and again, until you can do it without thinking.

I like pasta. Fresh pasta from the refrigeration aisle. Not the dried out shit. Start with plain pasta sauce in a bottle. It already tastes good and is hard to screw up. Then make the pasta sauce your own. Add red wine. Explain to her that the heat will evaporate the alcohol. Let it bubble.  Tell her you chose a Cabernet Sauvignon, because you like the complex scent and flavor. Anything over $15 should do. Get something you have enjoyed before. Costco is great for wines. Just don't buy that expensive bottle which has been standing upright so long it has dust on it. Offer her a glass of wine while she waits, and make some cheese on thinly sliced french bread. Chop up some fresh tomatoes and add them to the pasta sauce. Explain how you think the cheese brings out the wines flavor. Now you are just like Richard fucking Gere in pretty woman. Put the water on the boil. Start the mushrooms, garlic, onion (basically whatever you like) sauteing. Learn how to saute. Flip those shrooms by flicking the pan just right. All while telling her that funny story you know. Once ready, everything goes in the sauce. Put the pasta in the boiling water. Add whatever herbs you like to the pasta sauce. Dont forget salt and pepper. Let the pasta sauce simmer and smell good. Fill up her wine glass. Bonus points if you had home made garlic bread in the oven. Chop up some more of the bread to go with the meal and set the table. Then pull out the salad you threw together before she came over (made with the pre-cut weird green shit that only rabbits like but is always found in expensive restaurants.) Lastly, and most importantly of all is the presentation. Drain the pasta when it is al dente (which means whenever the fuck you want.) Put the pasta carefully on the plate, then artfully arrange the pasta sauce on top. Add black pepper (from a grinder) and cheese to taste. Maybe a sprig of something green on top. 

I've found there is no need to go all Godfather and make the sauce from scratch, just like you don't need to make the pasta from scratch. Just do it well and make it your own.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1cn4e9,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1cn4e9/emsk_how_to_cook_one_truly_exceptional_meal/,

Going in alphabetical order...

* [The Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com/) is an old favorite, full of manly advice about everything from food and etiquette to shaving and fighting. If you're on here, then you already know about AoM.
* [Life Hack Ninja](http://lifehackninja.com/) only has a few posts on it, but I think that it has potential. It generally consists of lists, such as [18 Items to Improve Your Quality of Life](http://lifehackninja.com/18-items-to-improve-your-quality-of-life/) and (surprise) [Use Reddit to Improve Your Life](http://lifehackninja.com/use-reddit-to-improve-your-life/). We're on that list, by the way!
* [Love My Life Right Now](http://lmlrn.com/) has become one of my favorite sites. I find the content to be very meaningful, with articles like [6 Ways to Deal With Conflict](http://lmlrn.com/6-ways-to-deal-with-conflict/) and [5 Ways to Ensure you Never Stop Growing](http://lmlrn.com/5-ways-to-ensure-you-never-stop-growing/).

LMLRN posts one article every couple of days, which I think is great. It's not overwhelming, and none of the articles feel like filler.
* [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) tends to be more of a tech-focused site, but they do post about other useful things. Out of all of these sites, Lifehacker posts the most (15-20 times a day); while you might not find everything on here useful, you're bound to find a couple of good posts each day.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I was at the movie theater with a few friends. In the row in front of us was an older (probably 35-40) woman, her husband (assuming), and son. From the start of the previews to the end credits, she did not shut up. She talked during important dialogue. She laughed at inappropriate moments. She was on her phone constantly. All in all, she was a complete and utter annoyance to everyone in the theater. 

And all I wanted to do was to tell her to shut up and behave. But I couldn't. Every time I prepared to speak up, I told myself, ""Nah, wait until the next time."" After the movie, my friends and I all talked about how she had ruined the night. I just couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to speak up. 

So, my request is for the psychological trick or attitude that helps people speak up or act out in public in order to address someone's rude behavior. ",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1je7jq,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1je7jq/emskrhow_to_speak_up_in_public/,

1373477221.0,100,self.everymanshouldknow,1i0pvn,EMSK At Least 3 Basic Knots,106,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1i0pvn/emsk_at_least_3_basic_knots/,"Knowing simple knot work is useful for camping, tying down things in a truck bed, emergency work, trips to the International Space Station and more things than I can list here.  You don't need to know a million specialty knots or be able to do macrame in order to be competent with a rope.  You really only need a few knots to do most things.  IMHO, as an Eagle Scout with a lot of camping/hiking/boating experience, these are the 3 most important knots to know:

1.  [Square knot](http://youtu.be/cuNwp_Pi33s) -- Useful for joining two short lines to make a longer line.  Do not confuse this with the much weaker [granny knot](http://youtu.be/AW3mUtSC1l0)!  Granny knots are bad.

2.  [Bowline](http://youtu.be/Q9NqGd7464U) or [Double Figure 8](http://youtu.be/AZUC132qE2Y) -- Makes a loop that won't slip.  Good for rescue work.  Most climbers prefer the double figure 8 ([here is a video on tying a double figure 8 in the end of a line for climbing](http://youtu.be/WakZ-77Ie3c)).  If you use a bowline make sure to leave extra line off the end in case it slips.  Many rescue professionals recommend a foot of extra line at the end if you use a simple bowline for rescuing somebody.  [The lightening method of tying a bowline](http://youtu.be/H85cMlvwwXA) could save your life some day.  [Here is the lightening method in action](http://youtu.be/BJAd-NSkLjA).

3.  [Tautline hitch](http://youtu.be/eG-xZFUVR-M) -- This is the most versatile camping and tie down knot I know.  It lets you tighten or loosen a loop and have it stay.  This is useful for holding down a tarp or connecting your tent to your tent stakes.  There are other similar friction knots that are sometimes better for a situation, like the [Prusik](http://climbing.about.com/od/dictionaryofclimbing/a/prusikknotdef.htm), but I consider them specialty knots.  The tautline hitch is a great general purpose friction knot.

To learn these, get a shoelace and keep it in your pocket.  Practice tying these knots while watching TV or while on the train until they become second nature to you.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Further study:

After you know these knots it's good to know a stopper knot like the [Ashley stopper](http://youtu.be/oUSidC2AenY), which can be tied to the end of a line to prevent the lines from pulling all the way through and your knots from coming fully undone if your knot slips.  Also, [simple figure 8s](http://youtu.be/cxYBNtZMoJo) are almost always better than overhand knots because figure 8s lock up less.

If you want to really get into knotwork I recommend the [Ashley Book of Knots](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385040253).  It's the knotwork bible.  If it's not in the ABOK it's probably not a knot.

If you want to get into pretty knots or knot theory, weaving rope into pretty button knot designs or rope jewelry or tying things like Spanish bowlines, there is an excellent online resource called Two Knotty Boys.  The knots there are amazing and the tutorials are excellent, but the web site specializes in knotwork and rope safety for BDSM.  I won't link to it here because some of it is NSFW, but most of it is SFW tutorials on some really cool knots.  Google for it if you are interested.

P.S. -- On the bowline debate, I personally prefer [the water bowline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bowline) as my preferred rescue knot, but I wanted to keep this post simple.  Every man should at least know how to tie a simple bowline.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1i0pvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1i0pvn/emsk_at_least_3_basic_knots/,

Most people feel it is the epitome of awkwardness and to a lesser extent loneliness, but to me, and hopefully you after reading this, a third wheel does to a date what a third wheel does to a tricycle; it helps it stay upright and balanced. Of course the only real time you will end up being a third wheel is somewhere inherently social; such as a themepark, but even if you get caught with them at a movie at home this information can still apply.

1. Don't be awkward yourself: keep conversation and help your friend move the date from one part to the next (if they can't decide on a place to eat, just make a call and 99/100 times they'll agree and avoid the awkward ""No you decide....No you decide"" cycle).

2. Bring a friend if you can and it's appropriate: there is some safety in numbers if you can get a friend (preferably a girl). The problem with having a guy is that it can turn into a bro-fest and then the girl feels left out, which isn't your job as a third wheel; but I've found just telling the guy that his reason is there so you aren't a third wheel generally gets them to ""play"" along and help move everything smoothly. (out of all my advice, this one can be ignored and kind of put in as an extra)

3. Your job is to act as a kind of wing-man: This isn't in the traditional sense as we believe it, but you still need to make your friend look good. This is the ultimate advice of being a third wheel and needs to be remembered. Bring up stuff about him that he couldn't normally bring up without bragging and if this is a new relationship than she will be more interested in him (without thinking of him as a braggart), and if it is an established relationship, it can help the remind the girl what she really likes about him.

4. KNOW WHEN IT IS YOUR TIME TO LEAVE: there is no obligation for you to stay with them at all times and when you see the girl or guy showing signs of.....for lack of a better term.... getting frisky, its time for you to go home and make up some excuse.

5. The job of a third wheel is a lonely one...or is it: the act of third wheeling doesn't have to be the epitome of loneliness. I always used it as an excuse to get out and be social (seeing as my friends generally invite me to third wheel cause I'm good at what I do). You can always meet someone where you're going and the two others save you from that ""I should just go home"" syndrome that unsocial people (like me unless I try really hard) fall into.

Hopefully this is good advice (my first post here) and I have had good results with this, please criticize if you find something wrong with it though or have any questions.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1elt77,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1elt77/emsk_how_to_correctly_third_wheel/,

Begin by etching the pipe with the acid paste, a light, thin coating is enough; connect your union (one at a time) apply heat as evenly as possible, push the solder gently into the ridge of the union, if it does not melt easily apply more heat and try again, the solder will wick right into the joint (it doesn't take much solder to accomplish a good seal (an inch or so of solder is plenty))  a good guideline to making sure your joint is sealed is by making sure there is a nice even silvery ring around the joint.

I like being bald however my hair that I do have on my head grows fairly fast and I want to keep it smooth but don't really like it too shiny.
It's to the point where I would have to shave it about every 16 hours to keep it smooth before the stubble type hair starts to grow back and it's no longer smooth. Problem being is I get razor burn if I shave it less than in 48 hours before the last shave.

To the point: Is there any products or ways of doing things that would keep my head smoother longer without to much shine.

Keep in mind there are always exceptions to the rules, and you are the best judge of what you like. 

Shaking Cocktails: 
	
Any drink containing eggs, dairy, or fruit juices should be shaken. The tiny air bubbles created will help to soften the sweetness of juices, and properly combine eggs and dairy with the spirits. 
Additionally, when using egg whites in a drink, it is necessary to first dry shake (no ice) the ingredients, then add ice, and shake again. This is done to achieve the proper foamy texture egg whites provide. 	
Shaking is meant to be violent. You should put a lot of strength into the shake, and continue to shake until frost forms on the outside of the shaker, or for at least 10-15 seconds.
All shaken cocktails should be double strained, using a fine mesh strainer, to remove ice chips, and pulp from the drink.

Stirring Cocktails:

When a drink contains no eggs, dairy, or fruit juice, it should be stirred. Drinks containing only spirits (like a Manhattan) are ALWAYS stirred unless the customer requests otherwise. The one exception to this is the vodka “martini.” Almost all customers prefer this shaken. It’s a good habit to ask the customer their preference.
When stirring, you should try to create as little turbulence as possible within the glass. This is best achieved by keeping the back of your spoon against the side of the stirring glass, and twisting it as you stir. 
Drinks should be stirred for at least 30 seconds to achieve proper dilution and chilling.

Simply give the container a couple of shakes into your palm, providing a small pile of powder into your hand. Proceed to apply the powder to your scrotum. I know it sounds funky, but it's a wonderful thing for your man sack. I've found laying down on my bed is the easiest way to apply it. Right before bed is the greatest time.

It sounds weird, but don't knock it 'til you try it. Gold Bond gives you a nice, fresh feeling, with a slight cooling sensation.

I'm also wondering if I'm one of the few who knows about this magical powder. . 

In case you're interested, [here](http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Bond-Ultimate-Powder-Comfort/dp/B000NP79JC) is a link for it on Amazon. It seems a little expensive, but it's worth it.

1369746909.0,36,self.everymanshouldknow,1f73r0,EMSK: How to Be a Best Man,36,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1f73r0/emsk_how_to_be_a_best_man/,"It's wedding season, so I thought I'd offer a few pointers on how to be a best man, should you be selected for this honor. I've been to quite a few weddings so far this year, and I've seen some really bad performances. Just a few tips:

**It Starts Before The Wedding**
The job starts well before the wedding. You're job here is basically to take as much load/stress of the groom's shoulders while he just worries about his core aspects of planning the wedding and his daily life. Offer to run errands for him, especially those that deal with the wedding planning. You can also offer to help the bride-to-be out with miscellaneous tasks, should she need help (it's a nice gesture). He may need help with his guest list, reservations/arrangements, scheduling, advice, and general venting. Don't let him stress out.

**Bachelor Party**
Find out as soon as you can if he even wants to have a bachelor party, and then find out what he would like to do. Make a check list of some ideas or things he may want to include to review with him, then take over the planning from there. When does he want to have it? Where? Strippers? (this is very important, as he may not want surprises, clear this kind of entertainment ahead of time). Is there anyone he *doesn't* want to be there? Activities? It's important to know that the groom should *not* pay for anything associated with the bachelor party. Try to estimate what his costs will be, and divide this burden equally among the attendees. Make sure take care of all of the invites, bookings, communications, etc. It should be a fun, relaxing time for the groom where he doesn't have to worry about anything. Also, make sure not to schedule it the night before the wedding, that's a very old cliche and is not smart for many reasons. 

**Tuxedos**
Unless the parents of the groom or bride are handling it, it's your job to handle the wedding party's tuxes (groomsmen, ushers, ringbearers, etc).  Schedule the fitting, make sure everyone has all of the accessories and whatnot. Make sure to pick them up and get them to the appropriate people. **Important:** You also need to make sure that all of the items are returned and not lost. This happens a lot, as guys lose jackets, etc all the time. If you see someone take their jacket off later in the night, grab and it stow it somewhere for safekeeping (let them know as well). Before leaving the reception, make sure there is nothing left behind and all tuxes are accounted for. Stash them in your car or hotel room until the morning. 

**Transportation** 
If necessary, you may need to provide transportation for guests to/from the airport or other places. Recruit other groomsmen or friends if you need help.

**Contact List**
Keep a list of contacts for all vendors and important attendees at the wedding (parents, officiant, florists, caterers, wedding parties, planner, drivers, etc). Also put together a backup list of certain vendors should someone fall through. Save it on your phone and print a copy for your pocket. 

**Expenses**
Although it isn't your responsibility to cover wedding expenses, you should keep some extra cash or a credit card on hand in case an emergency comes up and you need to cover the groom or someone else. You can always keep track of anything and speak with the groom or the family after the wedding for reimbursement. It's also nice to go around and tip the waiters/bartenders or other key helpers after the reception (if this hasn't already been negotiated).

**Rehearsal/Preparations**
Do some research on what's expected of you and the groomsmen during the rehearsal dinner, ceremony, and reception. It's not your responsibility, but you don't want to look lost, and will be able to hand out last minute instruction if someone forgets what to do.

**The Rock**
You need to be the grooms rock. Whatever he needs leading up to, and during the wedding is your responsibility. If he's nervous, keep his mind busy. Don't let him get cold feet. He's come this far, keep his head together. It's all about him and his bride to be.

**The Toast**
This is where I see the most issues and mistakes. Make sure you plan ahead and rehearse (keep a note card handy if you like). The most important thing to remember is that *this is not about you.* **IT IS ABOUT THE BRIDE** Do not try to steal the show. I see so many guys try get a standing ovation, or make themselves the center of attention with some pre-planned performance or video. A grand gesture can be nice, if it involves both the groomsmen and bridesmaids, but that can come after the toasts. Have the DJ or emcee help you get everyone's attention. Stick to the heart. No embarrassing stories or cliches. Thank everyone involved (first, whoever paid for the wedding), compliment the bride, and make a quick sentimental note about the groom. Congratulate them and wish them luck, and raise your glass. Be nice, be brief, and be gone. 

**Post-Wedding Prep**
Make sure that the groomsmen get checked out of the hotel on time (if applicable), and that the room is clean and the bill won't have any surprises. One last round of thanks for all involved. Coordinate the decoration of the getaway car (tip: delegate this to the bridesmaids, they're better at it), but make sure nothing is used that will mess up the paint. If there's no driver, you need to stay sober and be prepared to take them to the hotel or airport. Make sure you have all of the tuxes/accessories and that they are returned on time. Then, go get some sleep.

A few more quick tips:

**Dont Lose The Ring**
Goes without saying, but it happens. Keep it in the box, and constantly be mindful of it being in your possession until go time.

**Be On Time**
Make sure you and the groomsmen are prepared and on time for every step.

**Be Prepared**
Phone charged, itinerary on hand, arrive early for everything, make sure everyone is accounted for.

**Be Confident**
If you're prepared and collected, this will be no problem. Again, you're the rock. If you aren't up to the job, discuss it with the groom and recommend someone else. 

**Be Yourself**
This is what got you the job. If the groom didn't trust you or think you were up to it, you'd just be another guest. Be yourself, and everything will fall into place. Just make sure everyone is ready, and that the groom just has to worry about showing up.

1360636356.0,36,self.everymanshouldknow,18cnr2,More information on handshakes,47,11,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/18cnr2/more_information_on_handshakes/,"I read the short info graphic that was posted today about wrong hand shaking styles and although interesting i found it to be mostly common sense and thought i'd make this post. i searched this subreddit for more information about handshakes and didn't find much. so heres just some of my understandings on handshaking.

To start out, an open palm is long been associated with honesty, truth, and submission.  A good example of this is when pledging allegiance the open palm is set over the heart, or when taking [an oath](http://imgur.com/8KWo79c), it is held over an important document or text (ex: the bible).  Understanding this is important in learning how to use handshakes to your advantage.


An open palm is submissive, the corresponding handshake is the palm up postion.  In this handshake the person who is initiating the handshake is extending their hand out with the palm facing up.  In evolutionary circumstances a palm that was faced upwards showed that a person wasn't holding any weapons.  As a personal rule i usually don't shake other mens hands like this for the obvious reason that i don't submit to other men.  I do however use this handshake with women because it is seen as non threatening.  Also this is a good example of how this type of handshake is used in courtship.  Usually when i shake a woman's hand i'll extend my hand with my palm up grabbing her four fingers and giving a light shake.  If you fancy the woman/her friend or just want to score points, then you can add a [debonair flourish](http://imgur.com/om7mz9n) by leaning down and lightly kissing the back of her hand (this is classic gentlemanly stuff, if you've never tried it, you'd be amazed at how charming women find this).  I'll usually add a charming line as well like, ""Guurl that booty is driving me crazy"".

The opposite hand shake position is the palm facing down position.  This hand position can be seen as aggressive and/or un truthful.  An example of this is, sometimes when a person is lying they will not expose their palms.  As far as aggression goes it's safe to understand that if someone is using a submissive handshake stance, the other person must have a dominant one.  An example of an aggressive hand down gesture: I don't usually like using Hitler as an example for many things, but lets use [Hitler as an example.](http://imgur.com/wO5f5Cd)  So palm down postion handshakes can be seen as aggressive and dominating.  As a personal rule i don't usually use this kind of handshake unless: 
*I'm fucking with someone.
*They're fucking with me.
These kinds of things tend to happen at the bar when i've had too much whiskey. 

So it's safe to suppose that a level/vertical open hand is the safest option for meeting someone new or in a work place.  My personal rule for these handshakes is: if I see a person as an equal then i give them [this handshake.](http://imgur.com/DwUWfF7)  For this reason it is my most frequently used handshake.

So keeping in mind all this information, you can practice turning your hand after taking the other persons.  So if someone is giving me a dominant palm down handshake, then i can either very easily turn their hand to a level vertical position, or i can turn it all the way so their palm is up and mine is down.  The latter of these options I only used when i have a pure unadulterated disdain for the other person, and i want them to know, that i am alpha and they are beta.  Sometimes using this power play can be tricky and it is recommended that if you want to use a move like this (remember with great responsibility yadda yadda) then practice with a friend.  Sometimes it's tricky heaving the other persons hand over, so you can practice stepping in with one foot to assist with this.  If my right hand is out, my left foot is forward, the other party gives me a dominant palm down, I take the hand turn to a vertical position, then step in with my right foot and finish turning the hand over.


That is basically all i know about handshakes. So go out there and try them out.  Submit to people.  Fuck with people.  Have fun. My ""personal rules"" i mentioned in this post are empirical, but I learned most of this information from books on body language, and if i could recommend one it would be [""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease](http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Book-Body-Language/dp/0553804723)  I can definitely say that learning how body language works has helped me drastically in all areas of my life.  At work, with friends, and especially at bars and parties.  

I'd also like to mention that i am admittedly a noob, and have only had reddit for a few weeks.  So before you consider smiting me with your pugilistic internet rage, take into consideration that this is the first article i've ever written, and also [I'm new](http://youtu.be/Svg3IIRbBZ0).  I'm happy to take any constructive criticism, and if you read this whole article, I thank you and it's been fun.

1374695229.0,29,self.everymanshouldknow,1iz6wz,EMSK: How to roast a chicken (correctly).,41,12,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iz6wz/emsk_how_to_roast_a_chicken_correctly/,"First: watch this video for proper technique: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWLt6G85zC4

Second: The cavity can be LIGHTLY stuffed with all manner of aromatics that, unlike a can of beer, will actually effect the taste of the bird. Quarters of lemon or onion, bunches of thyme, rosemary, or sage are popular. Be careful not to overstuff. These items are just there very lightly flavor the air. Too much and they don't cook, no air escapes, and little flavoring happens.

Third: The bird is best cooked as hot as humanly possible. For some people with good ventilation in their kitchen, this means 450 from start to finish. For others, this might be 450 for 10-20 minutes, then dropping to 400 before the fat starts to smoke too much. My smoke alarms go off at the drop of a hat, so I usually start at 425 for 15 minutes, then drop to 400 with the convection fan on to mimic the cooking environment of a hotter oven.

Fourth: Until you know your oven and have a feel for timings based on bird size, you'll want to get and use a probe thermometer. You can get them on amazon for $15-$25, or from target or walmart or even some grocery stores. There's no reason not to use one. You're aiming for 160 in the thickest part of the thigh. Just set the probe in place before you put it in the oven and turn on your temp alarm for 155 or so to give yourself time. If you want extra assurance as to the doneness of your bird, tilt the pan so the juices run out of the cavity. They should be clear, not red. 

Fifth: Rest your bird for at least 15 minutes, longer if possible, before carving. It needs to stop cooking which, given its relative density, it will continue doing for quite some time after removing from the oven. 

Sixth: Carve properly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msscPphcLyo

Optional Extra step: STOCK! (note: stock != soup. Stock != broth. Stock is used later to make broth which is used to make soup).

Either a.) Chop up the carcass with a butcher knife, being sure to break the leg and thigh bones in half, as well as the main back bone, and throw in a gallon freezer bag. Do this every time you roast a chicken. When the freezer bag is full, make a shit ton of stock and freeze. 

b.) Chop up the carcass as mentioned in Option A and just... make stock. There are lots of variations on this, but the main point is simplicity.

1376440783.0,27,self.everymanshouldknow,1kbf12,EMSK How to Enjoy Drinking Whiskey.,35,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1kbf12/emsk_how_to_enjoy_drinking_whiskey/,"I originally wrote this for /r/malelifestyle, but given the recent post about how to shoot whiskey I thought that I might as well post it here too. This is meant to be a fairly brief beginner's introduction that only touches on the most important topics and ignores many of the nuances of drinking whiskey, so if you have any questions that aren't answered I will do my best to answer them.

Most people believe that whiskey and other distilled spirits serve only one purpose. That purpose is to get a person drunk as quickly as possible. While this certainly is a viable use for whiskey it is not the only one. For many, including myself, whiskey can be enjoyed for its flavors and aromas, even when not drinking enough to get drunk. This idea is obviously foreign to many. The reason for this is that most people simply have not been drinking quality whiskeys; rather they choose their whiskeys for quantity. 

The purpose of this guide is not to try and get you to stop drinking whiskey as you most enjoy it, nor do I wish to belittle the idea of getting drunk as it can be fun and a great male bonding experience. The purpose is to simply expose you to the idea that there are other ways to enjoy it so that you can better make an informed decision as to how you drink. Getting trashed and enjoying good whiskey are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but the decision is yours to make, and it is yours alone. In my opinion making your own decisions is what part of being a man and living the male lyfestyle is. If you only want to drink whiskey to get drunk, and not for the other qualities of the whiskey, stop reading here.

The first barrier that is in the way of a person enjoying whiskey is the harshness of the beverage. Some you will find to be very harsh, some only a little bit, and some of the best (and as a consequence likely more expensive) have almost none. Often harshness is due to the high alcohol content. There are several ways to get around this. First, is to use water to reduce the alcohol content. This can help to release the aromas and flavors as well as cut the burn from the alcohol. Second, ice can be used; this both reduces the alcohol content and cools the whiskey. Both the reduction in percentage and the cooler temperature will help cut the burn, however the cooling will also act to reduce the flavor of the whiskey. Third, and possibly the best, is to use a whiskey nosing glass such as a glencairn or copita. These have a “tulip” shape and help to concentrate the aromas of the whiskey making it easier to smell, which is also a very important aspect tasting anything. Snifters can also be used for nosing whiskey, though they are usually nor preferred. Over time a person will get used to the sensation of alcohol and with practice and patience they will learn to deal with it without having to think very much about it. 

Sometimes the harshness can come from the flavor profile of the whiskey. Not much can be done about this other than ice and cooling the whiskey. However, the best way to avoid it is to not buy whiskeys that you think taste bad.

Once you have dealt with the harshness of a whiskey you will finally be able to taste and nose the whiskey. Nosing should come first. It can help ease the drinker into the whiskey and can give a good idea of what to expect from tasting it. Smell is also an important aspect of taste, thus smelling it will help you get more flavor out of tasting it. Once again, practice is the only way to improve your nose and taste buds. 

The technique for nosing is fairly simple. Swirling the whiskey in the glass will help increase surface area of the whiskey and release more of the particles that create the aroma. Then, placing your nose in or near the top of the glass, inhale through your nostrils. Being able to do this without getting a nose full of alcoholic burn is a matter of practice and experimentation to find the right spot to place your nose and how to inhale.

When tasting it is often best to start with a relatively small amount of whiskey and move it around your mouth, then swallow. Many whiskeys will have unique flavors and finishes, meaning that the flavor may change after you have swallowed the whiskey. Some of the heaviest whiskeys have very long finishes that can last well after the liquid is no longer in your mouth. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of drinking whiskey.

I will also include a short list of some of the most highly suggested beginner whiskey brands for those people who have never heard of any other than Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, and Johnnie Walker. These aren’t my favorites, but they are the ones that most beginners tend to enjoy and they aren’t very expensive. There are many types of whiskey out there, all of which have their own unique flavors. The only way to find out what you like is to try them.

Bourbons: Makers Mark, Buffalo Trace, Rock Hill Farm, Four Roses, Evan Williams (Comes in Black Label and Single Barrel), Old Grand-Dad (Comes in 80 proof, 100 proof, and 114 proof), Bulleit.

American Rye: Bulliet Rye, Rittenhouse Rye, Dickel Rye, Russell's Reserve Rye.

Irish: Jameson (Comes in several types), Bushmills, Tullamore Dew.

Scotch: Highland Park 12, Glenfiddich 12, Laphroaig, Macallan.

1374693046.0,24,self.everymanshouldknow,1iz3sw,EMSK: How to get the most for your totaled car,31,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iz3sw/emsk_how_to_get_the_most_for_your_totaled_car/,"Today, I ended a two-week long negotiation with my insurance company over the value of my car.  I totaled it by running a red light that I didn't see (was looking for a landmark in an unfamiliar city) and having someone hit me.  The accident was 100% my fault, but I have collision coverage.  I managed to get my insurance company to increase their initial offer by about $400 (on a car worth &lt;$6000) by being persistent, polite, and most of all, informed.  I figured I'd share what I learned and what I did with you all, so hopefully you can save yourself from being short-changed as well.  While I was negotiating with my own insurance company, I would assume the same techniques would work when working with someone else's insurance in the event that you are not at fault in the collision.

First, do know that you don't have to take any offer the insurance company gives you.  Many people just assume that they have to take it because they think they don't hold any cards.  A totaled car is perceived as worthless, so the offer the insurance company makes you seems like a gift.  It's not.  The insurance company will sell your car for salvage.  They may even stand to make some money if your car is only barely totaled or is rare enough that the parts are valuable.  So don't think of it as you receiving a gift.  You are absolutely selling your car to them just as you would to anyone else, and you can leave any offer on the table.

Second, learn exactly how your insurance policy calculates the payment you're due.  The most important distinction is between the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of the car and the Replacement Cost (RC) of the car.  The ACV is what your car is worth *in the state it was in before the collision*, while the RC is the cost of the same model car in excellent condition.  The valuation should be laid out in your policy.  In my case, my car was insured for the ACV, which is almost always lower (sometimes much lower) than the RC.

RC negotiations are simple, as they revolve solely around the cost of similar cars in the area.  Your insurance company will determine their offer based on listings that they find of similar cars in your area in the last few months.  Ask to see those listings.  Make note of geography, as the car market 100+ miles away may be very different.  Note any discrepancies in model years, etc.  Know why those differences might be important.  You might have a 2007 model of a car, and the insurance company pulled comparables for the 2008 model, which seems fair.  But make sure that the 2008 model is the same!  That year may have a common problem with the suspension or engine that may lower the value.  Research that and report it to your insurance company.  Pull your own listings and make sure they jive.  If they don't, bring it up.

If your policy is for the ACV, make sure your car was properly evaluated.  In my case, I had $305 deducted from my offer because my car was determined to be in ""good"" mechanical shape.  I maintain my car very well, and I know it's in much better shape than ""good.""  Furthermore, the adjuster that came to inspect my damage could have never evaluated the mechanical aspect of the car as my hood was jammed shut.  I discovered that they just *assumed* the car was in ""good"" shape based on the age (high) and mileage (low) of the car.  I demanded that we get the hood open and actually do an inspection.  Sure enough, most of my components were in ""very good"" shape.  That alone was an adjustment of over $230.  Also make sure that no features in your car was missed.  Do you have heated seats? Power mirrors?  Fancy headlights?  Make sure that all of those show up on the report.  Even basic things should be accounted for.  I nearly lost out on $80 because they didn't notice that my car has an alarm.

As a corollary to the above points, make sure to keep your maintenance records.  I received compensation for relatively new brake pads and timing belt - both were replaced in the last 6 months.  It also helps to show that you make a habit of caring for your car and will give you a basis to argue other points.  I had a small chip in my windshield as a result of the accident, but it was quite far away from the site of the collision.  Initially, the adjuster was reluctant to say that it wasn't a pre-existing flaw.  However, by showing the representatives I worked with that I took care of problems as soon as they arose, I was able to convince them that that chip should not negatively impact the value of my car.  $50 gained.

Lastly, know how to work with people.  Be polite but firm.  If there's any number you're confused about, ask.  Don't be afraid to ask for a supervisor.  And don't forget your nuclear option - arbitration or lawsuit.  These are potentially tremendously expensive for both you and the insurance company, but if there is even a chance that you are right, the insurance company may cave.  I had to threaten arbitration before getting my vehicle re-evaluated, but it worked.  If you are right and you have the data to back you up, don't be afraid to do the same.  But also don't use it too early, as you also don't want to come off as a jerk.  Try to avoid saying things like ""I want $xxxx"" in favor of ""Well, my data shows that my car would be worth more like $xxxx.""

In all, I spent about 12 hours either on the phone or doing my own research, for a return of about $40/hr.  That's pretty good for me - your time may be more valuable.  But my friends and family were amazed that a) I was arguing with my insurance company when I was  at fault, and b) that I was *winning*, so I figured I'd share my experience here.

**TL;DR** You don't have to take their offer.  Do your own research, present your own data, and demand a fair hearing and evaluation.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,1374701287.0,,,True,t3_1iz3sw,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iz3sw/emsk_how_to_get_the_most_for_your_totaled_car/,

Heres what you need

as many steaks as you want, i prefer a good thick marbled t-bone that is about the size of my head

butter, lots of god damn butter, unslated, preferably with the tears of virgin dutch milk maids, but storebought is fine too

olive oil, cheap, fancy, whatever as long as its virgin olive oil it will work

1 sprig of ether thyme or rosemary ( i prefer rosemary)

salt

pepper

one clove of garlic

and if you want to get real god damn fancy, some mushrooms, an onion, a bottle of hefeweizen, and a tiny little pinch of allspice

You gonna need a big ol cast iron skillet for this one.

leave your steak on the counter, unwrapped for 15 minutes

Heat the skillet over medium for about 5-10 min (10 for electric glass top, 5 for gass or electric exposed)

when the skillet is hot, add about 2 tablespoons of butter, let it melt, once it melts crank the heat up to medium high.

salt and pepper the steak, both sides

once the butter starts to sizzle, set the steak in, dont fucking touch it for atleast 2 minutes, flip that bastard and 
give it another 2 minutes

take your clove of garlic, dont peel it, dont fucking chop it, channel your inner man and crush that bastard, throw it in the pan

add more butter, 2 more tablespoons and about a tablespoon of olive oil, keeps the butter from burning, at this point add the rosemary or thyme (the entire sprig)

crank the heat to high, flip the steak and start basting it with the butter and olive oil, after another minute, flip it, you should start to see some glorious brown crust form, once its as crusty as you want, remove from pan.

if you prefer your steak medium then throw the steak into the oven in a glass dish for minute or two on broil (bottom rack), i say glass dish because you are going to want those delicious juices back

once the steak is resting, chop your onion and mushrooms, add to the same unwashed pan you just used, add a 

drop of oil and sautee those bastards till the onions are soft, turn the heat down to medium and pour in about a 
third a can of the beer, and the pinch of allspice, keep stiring and scraping the bottom of the skillet (wooden 
spoon god dammit) till it reduces to a thick sauce

top the steak, consume, preferably with more beer.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1cnlmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1cnlmy/emsk_how_to_cook_the_best_damn_steak_you_will/,

* Application technique - Run throughout dry hair

Hair Spray - The Finisher

* Visual- Clear, spray, container: aerosol can
* Texture- Tacky
* Finish - Very stiff, mildly flexible, slight shine/shimmer (the more used the more shine), can create debris if interrupted (touched), can breakdown
* Characteristics of use - Hold, good for finishing touches or to keep a hairstyle in place
* Application technique - Spray on finalized hair style, particularly in areas to keep in place (such as front), more use will hold better but also appear shinier.

**The Techniques**

Most products are to be applied with damp hair to be able to work the product into the hair and style it.  The product will generally appear much different once dry. With most products, hair spray can be lightly used to lock in the style or hold fly-aways in place.  After using products, a blow dryer *can* be used but on too high of a setting it can disrupt the desired style.

To achieve a dry, messy but styled look, certain products (especially waxes) can be applied to dry hair.  That being said, it's much more difficult to work into the hair.

Additionally, don't limit yourself to 1 product.  To achieve the desired result, you may need a few different products.  Say you want soft clumped together hair but you want the front to stand up.  You might use a wax on all of your hair and a fiber only on the front to style it.  Keep a few different products in your arsenal to suit your mood and style for the day.

**Additional Items**

Don't use too much, start with little and work it in.  Generally you want to apply to damp, not wet hair.  A product will smell different (awful in some cases) once it has dried so try it out first before buying in bulk.  Bottom line, try things out and see what works for you.  Although more expensive products tend to work better, there are plenty of cheaper products that are great.  Not all products work the same (i.e. one wax may yield a different result than another), so it's worth it to try various brands and varieties.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1jix9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1jix9s/emsk_hair_styling_products/,

I am starting a small blog where I want to challenge myself to do something manly. I grew up pretty much raised by my mother and sisters (Father was always working and brothers had too much of an age gap) So I had a very mild childhood. While I did learn how to be a gentleman, I'd like to try something I have never done, every week of the year. Also every month I would like to have one larger challenge that will take more than a day to do. 

I've had suggestions like, go to a shooting range, go hunting, chop down a tree, get a tattoo, run a (8,7,6,5) minute mile, and other things like that, but I'd like to get your opinion. What would you like to read about/watch short videos on?

People always say do what you Love as your job and you'll be professional at it. That's not always the case however when you're going to school to get the degree you want, are relatively new to living on your own, and have to stick with a mediocre job for the time being before you reap the fruits of your dream career (which statistics are about half and half for graduates)

As of current I'm on a type-rope with my current employment at a sandwich shop. And knowing from previous circumstances itll probably end up in being fired like the last 2 jobs I've had that have lasted less than 5 months..... this year. 

My job cycle being I get hired for being a charismatic individual who can do the company good. I enjoy my job and excel at it and boss is happy. I make a few mistakes along the way boss calls out but I fix them (at least I think). Until I get a stern talk one day about how I'm performing poorly/ how my jobs at stake. At this point I get nervous and am paranoid at my every movement to make sure I dont fuck up. And I ask at random opportune moments if my performance is well. No comment. So I keep trucking, eventually building a positive attitude until hopes get crushed about more problems I didn't know about saying if they see one more mistake I get fired. Im hoping that doesn't happen this week...... help? 

On a side note I'm re-starting nofap, smoke only occasionally now (hookah and electric cigs), have a moderately active lifestyle, and have a history of ADD and General Anxiety Disorder/ Depression. May/ Not be applicable to quirks/ work ethic.

First I""ll start by saying behavioral management is one of the hardest sciences to practice. Almost all undesirable behavior comes to us on the fly and most of the time requires immediate interventions in order to be effective. I will summarize effective quick interventions in the form of rules and concepts that in my experience as a behavioral specialist work very well.

1) Data on effective interventions state that immediate adversive consequences are 19% effective at modifying behavior, positive incentives before the behavior takes place are 73% effective at dealing with the same undesirable behaviors.

2) When a unpredictable behavior takes place use your tools to figure out the how and the why first. What did they get out of it? What did they avoid? What was the setting? Do not feed into the function of the behavior or you are showing them that their behavior is ok and they will continue to use it as a tool.

3) When a behavior occurs there are almost always witnesses, confer with the witnesses (other kids) before you enforce a consequence. If there are no witnesses modify your consequence as such, ""I don't know what happened but To avoid this issue in the future I'm going to be here whenever you do such and such"" enforcing a consequence without proof leads to resentment and one mistake leads to lasting mistrust.

3) If you suspect its an issue with reteaching a better skill or your not 100% certain they did something use the time to teach them a new skill and tell them you expect they use the skill. If they are limit testing shut them down and make sure you follow through EVERY time they test you, after one good fight or a few small ones all the other battles stop before they start. If they fight and you let them get what they want you have shown them that wearing you down works and they will use it as a tool.

4) When you are first expected to be responsible for said child, start by being firm, fair and consistent during your honeymoon period together. Its much easier to start that way and be the fair good guy in the end then to start in a lax grey area and try to claw your authority back, they will walk over you because you taught them to.

5) Many positive privileges are easier to manage than many adversive consequences. Also you get better buy in, and more respect for what you do rather than what you take away.

6) Do not impose a consequence that you don't have the ability to enforce, it makes you look foolish which will lead to disrespect.

7) Older kids hunt for reactions, do not react and do not feed into the function of the behavior, ask them what the expectation is and what the consequence for not following through and enforce it. Fight that battle until you have won, and do it consistently. Failure to do so will always result in them using this as a tool to wear you down every time. Then you can't intervene because you are too spent to do so.

8) Make a big deal out of disrespect, it can snowball out of control if you show them disrespect is ok. Set a precedence by saying ""That's disrespectful and I will not tolerate disrespect, if you continue to waste our time we'll have to try again on your own time."" (during a preferred activity.)

9) DO NOT NEGOTIATE while a child is limit testing. Compromise is something left for times when the expectations are being followed. You show them that arguing and negotiating works when you give in. Say in a level tone ""This sounds like an argument, you're limit testing I'm going to start a timer we're going to have to make up this wasted time latter should you continue"" (start the timer and ignore the child as he/she continues to argue). Take the time out of their preferred activity to discuss better options next time.

10) Never get physical or spank, the reason why is actually complicated. As an adversive consequence spanking does work on the surface however it creates resentment that comes out whenever the child is not under your direct supervision. Why should the child care if your not around to enforce good behavior by hitting them? These are the kids that are perfect around mom and dad but systematically tear apart babysitters and teachers with their testing. The child is taught to incorrectly assign blame outside of themselves due to resentment.

11) Keep kids on  their toes and make your time together important and interesting. If they value time with you they don't want to undermine that time with misbehavior.

12) Teach kids high value skills, and how important they are because because they know those skills. They wont want to undermine their pride knowing misbehavior will ""taint"" them or peoples view of them. Such social cues are healthy and normal.

13) DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE MISBEHAVIOR IN ANY POSITIVE WAY! It may be funny when jimmy makes fart noises but it wont be when he thinks its ok on his first date. What you feel is ok is different from what is best for your kids. Leave yourself and your own behaviors out of it. Ask yourself what is best and be fair firm and consistent you will both become better people.

14) If you have to impose a logical consequence make sure timewise it is as close to the behavior as possible. Don't want to go to bed? I'll remove the distractions from your room until you do. Quick effective, fair and firm. Reinforcement is dependent upon the relation between consequence and behavior timewise.

(I understand the difference between American BBQ and Australian BBQ). I am referring to the LPG burner, cast iron hotplate and grill style BBQ predominately seen here in Australia, although this technique can be used on any cast iron cook ware.
Once you have finished cooking your food, remove the food and turn all the burners used to cook the food to HIGH. Using your BBQ Tool scrape all excess you can from the hotplate onto some paper towel or old newspaper and discard in the bin. If you have a hood on your BBQ then close that now. You are now heating your hotplate up as fast as possible.
Go inside and get a container of very hot water, drop and mix in a large quantity of dishwashing liquid. Grab your long handle pair of tongs and a nylon scourer you are happy to sacrifice. Steel wool is also acceptable here, although the results won't be as good.
Once you have your hotplate hot enough, I find the ecess grease and oil starts smoking, use the tongs to douse the scourer in the water and dishwashing liquid, and then in sections, use the scourer to scrub the hotplate.
!!WARNING!! Steam will ensue, and flying hot grease and water will also be present, use LONG handled tongs for this.
The water coming into contact with the extremely hot hotplate will quickly turn the hot water to steam. The liquid detergent will help dissolve the fats and the steam will separate it from the hotplate an onto the scourer. Continue to do the remainder of the hotplate. Doing small sections at a time, and moving from side to side on the hotplate will help reduce the likelihood of the hotplate cooling down in a certain area.
Once clean, turn the burners off, and allow to cool slightly. Coat your hotplate with your choice of cooking oil making sure to wipe over for a thorough covering. This will prevent any rusting. Using a spray can of oil such as Canola oil is entirely acceptable, and easy as you can be removed from the hotplate by the distance of the spray. If you are using this method however, ensure there are no naked flames which could ignite the oil vapour. *Source: Experience.
Allow the hotplate to cool naturally, and clean up the remainder of the BBQ.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,t3_1c13ku,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1c13ku/emsk_how_to_clean_a_bbq_hotplate_effeciently/,

It can easily be broken down into 3 parts. Master all 3 and you'll be a bra master in no time.

* 1: First off, determine how the bra clasp works. Most are the same, usually with between 2 and 6 little hooks, but some with have alternative means. This guide is for the most common design, 4 hook and eye style clasps. Also, assuming that the hook is on the woman's right and the eye on their left.

* 2: Next up is the grip. You'll want to use your right hand. Front in front of your partner, reach around her, likely under her arm, but that isn't so important. From there, dig into the band (not like an animal, but get a good grip) with a finger in and behind each hook. Your thumb should grip the opposite part of the band.

* 3: Last, but easier the most important and hardest to explain; the motion. You want to close your hand, pushing with your thumb and pulling with your fingers. If done correctly, the eyes shouldn't move much, but the hooks should slip right out and the bra should be undone and your partner should be thoroughly impressed.

Once you have this down, it shouldn't take much practice to perform. I personally have used this technique on 2, 4 and 5 hook bras and with the exception of being a bit harder to get the grip right, I have been able to so it in one motion, with one hand. And she is impressed every time.

1. When you arrive at the party and you're a bit late and everyone's already buzzed or worse don't ever try to catch up. You'll only end up more fucked up than them and faster. Take it slow.

2. If you feel you're getting drunk already slow down, this ain't a race.

3. If you feel sick and need to vomit don't fight it, find the nearest non-occupied bathroom and let it all out, flush twice, wash your face and rince your mouth. If you find mouthwash even better, you don't want your breath to smell like vomit and stomach acid is really bad for your teeth. After this you'll feel much better or even well enough to continue drinking.

4. Passing out/ falling asleep when parties die down is completely normal. Just don't be the first one unless you like having a huge penis drawn on your face and a whip cream beard. If you absolutely have to lie down make sure people notice you made a concious effort, take off your shoes, hat, whatever to make it look like you went out on your own terms. This would make people think you wanted to go to sleep and weren't just too hammered to say your own name.

5. Don't mix hard liquour with sweet drinks. Because of the sugar it gets absorbed way faster.

6. Stay hydrated. Hydrate enough and there's a big chance you might miss the pounding headache.
