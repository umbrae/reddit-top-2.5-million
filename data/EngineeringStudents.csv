1352916604.0,386,self.EngineeringStudents,136wyw,Trends in Engineering Student Resumes - Top Mistakes After Reading 100+,462,76,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/,"A few weeks ago our group of engineering recruiters threw up a thread where we were accepting and reviewing engineering student resumes. [Check it out over here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/119sce/need_help_on_your_resume/) We ended up reviewing hundreds of resumes, and we found some interesting trends that we'd like to share.

#1. Perhaps the most interesting one is that well-formatted resumes almost always belonged to students with a lower GPA. Students with higher GPAs (3.5+) almost always had badly formatted resumes. My guess is that students with lower GPAs focus on presentation value to make up for the weaker GPA. There is good news for them - it works! The presentation value matters more than you think it would. Having a bad resume is like not wearing a suit to an interview. When we have to sort through resumes quickly, our eyes naturally gravitate to good looking resumes, and if we have two equally qualified candidates to choose from, we might as well choose the guy who has a nicer resume. After all, it looks like he put more work into his job hunt.

This trend seems like a really strange thing to us overall. You work hard and pay big money for an education to get an awesome job. If you have a 3.8, you have the tools you need to be awesome, so why not spend an hour or two making sure your resume shows you are awesome?

#2. After staring at a stack of resumes, your eyes begin to glaze over and you eagerly identify good formatted resumes from afar. To give you a better idea of what a good resume looks like, we are assembling the best and the worst resumes from the past month and we will show you what their formatting looks like. We'll be making that post in the near future, but if you want to get the scoop faster, [subscribe to our newsletter!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com)

#3. About half of the resumes submitted did not have a GPA attached. People who expressed concern that their GPA was low didn't actually have extremely horrible GPAs. Most people who said they were low were in the ~2.7 range, which is not as bad as it seems! Perhaps the only time we would recommend not writing your GPA on a resume is when it is below 2.50. Many large engineering companies have their cutoffs at 2.50, and by not writing down your GPA, you are automatically disqualifying yourselves from some good job opportunities.

If your GPA is not listed we know you are hiding something. Instead of making us work to call you or interview you about your GPA to make sure you are a good fit, it's easier for us to find another candidate who is a better fit on paper.

If you are still nervous, consider listing only your Major GPA or list it first.

Listing your GPA, even if you think it is low, will put you above the masses.

#4. A decent number of people put pictures in their resumes. We have seen pictures of people's faces, QR codes, university emblems, pictures of application icons, and more. It looks funny! Having your face stare up at me will grab my attention, but in a bad way. Keep your resume picture free. It looks clean and professional that way.

#5. For descriptors, everyone seems to undervalue themselves. Students ""assisted"" with projects or ""participated"" in something. What does that tell me? Readers of your resume are not interested in your generic job description. We want to know what *you* did! Did *you* calculate the horsepower of a pump? Did *you* draw a schematic for a piece of equipment? Did *you* program 10,000 lines of code to make your employer's life easier? Did *you* save the company $1,000 with your accomplishments? These are things that we are most interested in.

A real common one is that people like to put is their senior design projects on their resumes. Instead of speaking about what *you* did on that senior design project, students often say what the team accomplished. So it doesn't help us to know that your team designed a car. We want to know what part of the car *you* designed.

#6. Although it's good to be specific on descriptors, you want to be specific on what you accomplished. This does not mean throw engineering jargon into the resume. Even as engineers, we do not always understand what something technical like ""Worked on a DC-28 modulator which increased palpitation of the deglobber"" means. Show your technical capabilities, but do not lose us in the finer details!

#7. We were surprised at how many people have had industry experience in terms of internships and co-ops, and did not represent those experiences well! A lot of people put their experiences in chronological order, but this can be to your disadvantage. If you were an intern at ExxonMobil last summer, and you are a cashier presently at school, then do not list cashier first on your resume! The internship from ExxonMobil is much more impressive and should be listed first.

So make sure your best experiences are up top. Recruiters who are in a massive hurry might not read the bottom halves of your resumes.

Let us know what you think and post any questions on anything - resumes, job interviews, career fairs, whatever.

Do you want an engineering recruiter to critique your resume? We can – it’s what we do.

We just released our first service and are offering a promotion to get the buzz going. We will look at your resume and offer personalized advice for $4.99 until November 21st. After that, the price will go up to $69.99. [Interested in having us look at your resume? Click this link!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com/services) 

Any other, non-personal questions you should post in this thread below! We have also done some mock interviews with a few people we have met on Reddit and have gotten awesome feedback. We are looking for more people to mock interview. If you are interested, email us at **talk@cockrellcareeradvice.com**

**tl;dr** Write down your GPA. Format matters. No graphics. Talk about what *you* did. Be specific on your descriptions but don't get too technical. Put the good stuff at the top of your resume.

[EDIT] Thanks for the great response everyone! It looks like we answered everyone's questions.

---

There have been some number of posts on r/EngineeringStudents providing or requesting study/cheat sheets for various topics and courses.  I did my best to go through old posts and put them all in one dropbox folder for everyone's benefit:

* [/r/EngineeringStudents study sheets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/prq54ou3asfln3y/lg6BmxdZU7)

They are organized by general topics.  Organization is likely to change as more guides are added.

Also, this personal website has a good collection:

* [Andy Friedman's Physics/Math/Astronomy Cheat Sheets](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~afriedman/CheatSheetsIndex.html)

---

If you have any of your own that you'd like to contribute, please post and I'll add it to the bunch.  PDF preferred.

My personal recommendation on use of these is to not have them replace any cheat sheets you need for your own exams, but just use them as a study reference or for guidance when you're making your own.  Creating the sheets is an effective way to study, so don't deprive yourself of that.

Sorry for not attributing all the authors, but they can be found from previous posts in this subreddit.  Let's see your best!

    Not a creature was stirring, nor fighting with CAD.
    The computer shut down and the printer sat idle,
    All word is completed for this testing cycle.

    The students were strung out on stimulants ingested
    gotten from baristas from who they requested.
    We study so much, our diet suffers,
    The last time we had a decent meal, it was cooked by our mothers.

    Projects were rushed and barely finished on time;
    the fact that there are exams should be considered a crime.
    Too many units were taken this quarter
    Professors scheduled exams in the worst possible order.

    Not the first time this happened, and it won't be the last,
    I still look forward to when this will all be in the past.
    Such is the life when you take engineering,
    Call me crazy, but I find it endearing.

    Now the library is crowded for another all nighter,
    I remember the days where I only solved voltage dividers.
    This is the final push, one more week to go,
    Then off to spring break, to drink and play in the snow.

I did my BS EE at UT Dallas. Graduated Spring 2012. So its all fairly recent. I also have a psych minor, that info is in there too, along with some random classes I kept info from that I was required to take. Also have a few grad classes for UT - MSEE in Energy Systems. Managed to compress to just under 2GB. Classes are sorted by course number and name, I believe I have a lot of the syllabi in there as well to help you reference similarities. I did my best to take the ""right"" profs, but I slipped here or there. Generally you want to take the ones I did.  

I hope this helps you.  
  
PS: I have a lot of finals reviews and stuff in there (in some cases the finals themselves).

EDIT2: This also contains all my lab reports, and their respective labs when possible. It also contains many old test that were given to me by other students.

This is an exciting time, and everyone wants to do whatever they can to prepare in the best way possible.  Having gone through this process myself, combined with being an older community college student, I thought I should put together a little guide with things that you can do to prepare for your time in engineering school.


Keep in mind that I am a mechanical engineering student, and some of my suggestions may not be applicable for your major or for your school.  The best I can do is put together a little guide that would have worked for me.  That said, let's get started.


*  What kind of computer devices would you recommend, laptop, netbook, desktop, tablet?

     This is something that is going to vary substantially, but I've found myself to work best with a laptop with a dedicated graphics processor (not a built in intel one) and a non-atom processor.  This allows me to run a solid modeling program like SolidWorks (will get into this more later) and being able to view models.  In terms of what brand laptop, I leave that up to you.  You will want something light and a good battery life.  I have a 15.4"" 2010 MacBook Pro and I use Windows almost exclusively on it.  Macs are popular, but few (if any) engineering software packages run on them, and no FEA (again, we'll talk about this later) packages are mac compatible as far as I can tell. 

    In addition, I have a desktop with a faster processor, dual monitors (you would be amazed how often dual monitors helps, they don't have to be large, but just having two of them makes all the difference) and a higher end (by higher end I don't mean latest generation by any means, just something that's come out in the last ~4 years and can play most modern games on decent settings).

    This combination lets me do schoolwork at school, and then when I need to do something that takes some more serious processing power (some matlab code that has a ton of number crunching, or a complex SolidWorks model) I can do it at home.  

     In terms of tablets, I occasionally see them, but frankly I've never thought ""oh a tablet here would be useful"".  ...I take that back, I wish I had a tablet for my last career fair to show off a video of a computer simulation I made of a [soda can being crushed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqs_J0zsf68).  I would never suggest a new student purchase a tablet to assist with their academic studies.  

* Textbooks, digital/print, used/new etc etc

    First thing first, books while they might be listed on the Syllabus are not always mandatory.  I've gotten through a number of courses without purchasing the book.  For my engineering courses though, I always buy the books and use them as references down the line.  So assuming you need the book, digital or hard copy?

    Where digital books work:  GE papers where you have to read one book source and write a report on a topic.  An example, I took a politics of warfare course a year ago.  I had to read this ~400pg book and write an analysis about how France was brought into World War 1.  Instead of reading all 400 pages, I bought the book for the kindle, used the PC kindle reader, used the find tool and found every instance of ""France"" in the book.  I was able to put together a very thorough outline and despite my paper being 2 pages short of the ""minimum length"", I got an A with a comment ""excellent analysis"", as it was so thorough.  I saved myself a crap ton of time, by doing this and would recommend using e-books in this regard.

    Where digital books don't work:  Engineering books just don't translate into digital versions well.  Often in my engineering books I'm flipping through chapters very quickly trying to find a specific chart/graph or something to that effect, and even in PDF format, I just can't go through the book very quickly.  PDF versions of the book can be useful when accompanying a print version in case you need to find a specific keyword, but that's the end of that.  Also, many engineering exams are open book, and that will be hard to justify use of your laptop/tablet during an exam.

    Always buy books used if they're at all cheaper than the new books.  Rarely should you buy from your college bookstore, and instead buy from amazon.com, half.com or some other online retailer.  With my GE courses, I have always [resold them back to amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sell-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2205237011).  I often sell back my engineering books and purchase an older edition of the same book (if there is a substantial price difference).  There is no reason to have the latest edition of a textbook on your shelf after you've taken the course.  Also, you might be able to use an older edition textbook during the course, this will vary from course to course based on how the professor runs his class.

* Software Packages

    A lot of this will be more useful once you've given your .edu email address.  For the purposes of this guide, I will assume you have a .edu email address.  I also do not condone piracy in any way shape or form, I am just referencing software that I use regularly.  It is up to each individual to acquire the software in a manner they see fit.

   * [Sign up for dropbox](http://db.tt/PWFSnWVk).  The link posted is a referral link, and if you register through that link you will get 250MB of extra dropbox space on top of the 2GB you start out with.  Dropbox is an amazing service which a college student doing work on multiple computers, or collaborative work cannot do without.  It keeps all the files inside your C:\Users\ &lt; your user name &gt; \Dropbox folder synced up across multiple computers.  You can also share folders within the dropbox folder with other people making collaborative projects/assignments much easier to manage.  If you register with a .edu email address, you will get a double referral bonus, so every time you refer someone to use dropbox, instead of getting 250MB, you'll get 500MB.  

    * [Learn LaTeX](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/) if you want to make your work stand out from the rest.  [Here are a bunch of useful links](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/j2326/getting_started_with_LaTeX) regarding LaTeX.  A popular Windows LaTeX client is [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/).  If you hand in work/reports using LaTeX, you will blow away the graders.  Learning LaTeX is probably one of the best things you can do before attending college.

    * MatLab must be had.  While it's impossible to just say ""install and learn how to use matlab"", just keep in mind you WILL be using MatLab, so do not shy away from it.  If you decide to go to graduate school, you will use MatLab there as well.  Some classes will require you use it more than others, but never, ever, shy away from it.  

    * SolidWorks is a damn near requirement for Mechanical Engineers.  [Here is a link to their facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/solidworks).  I linked the facebook group because they periodically give away a educational software licenses, so you want to jump on that whenever you see that offer.

    * AutoCAD Inventor is the AutoDesk alterantive to SolidWorks.  I've used it a little because I had to for a course, but I've found SolidWorks to be much better.  That said, it is FREE with a .edu email address, and [it can be downloaded here](http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center). 

    * Some students also use [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/), however I have never used them with any great frequency so I can't say much about them. 

    * Microsoft Office 2007/2010 cannot be avoided.  Yes there are other alternatives, however the features that Office provides are hard to beat, and not to mention if you will be doing any kind of collaborative work, you're going to want your Word Processor to match everyone else.  Learn the advanced features of Word and Excel.  In Word, learn how to reference stuff, and otherwise build your ""Works Cited"" page, Table of Contents automatically.  

    * For collaborative projects where people must work on documents simultaneously, I highly recommend the use of google docs to build the content.  Then export the google doc to Word, and perform the finishing touches there.  

    Now that I've discussed software, I want to drive one point home.  **Never** delete old reports, SolidWorks models, or any digital work of yours.  When you get close to graduation, you may want to built a portfolio showcasing your past work.  Always save everything.  I've had companies ask me for writing samples on a somewhat specific topic.  ""Sure no problem, here is a copy of my heat transfer design project write up"".  


Community college transfers, each of you will have a unique experience when transferring into a University.  I was really apprehensive, but I found out that I actually had a stronger command of linear algebra, electricity and magnetism, programming and materials background than my classmates that were at the University from freshman year.  You will be competitive, however the roles of the professors will change drastically.  Be prepared to teach yourself more often than you're accustomed to (this goes for Freshman students as well), which is not necessarily a bad thing, however be aware of the change of the role.  

The other thing that I need to recommend is to not worry about studying ahead before a course begins.  The best thing you can do to prepare for your University courses is to go to school relaxed and well rested.

Well, I should get back to the final lab report that I've been procrastinating on.  Please don't hesitate to ask any questions here.  I'm sure lots of other students will have matters to comment on as well.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_r2fu4,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r2fu4/protips_for_new_engineering_students/,

1369417623.0,147,self.EngineeringStudents,1ezejb,Just accepted a job offer! Some job search and interview tips that I found helpful along the way.,180,33,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ezejb/just_accepted_a_job_offer_some_job_search_and/,"If you are currently in the process of trying to obtain a job, I hope I can give you some pointers and info that really helped me go from terrible at interviewing and not really sure of myself, to killing 8 interviews in 1 day with everyone from the CEO of the company down to the engineers I'd be working with.  The person in charge of hiring mentioned that he was extremely impressed in me and that every single interviewer was too.  Most of these are probably obvious, but too many people don't want to follow them.  

General Tips:  

1.  Apply to tons of places early, and definitely tailor your cover letter for the company if you really want it.  Do not wait for each one to get back to you.  
2.  Use your school's job resources, start early.  They were extremely helpful for me from looking over my resume, giving me guidance early on, and just giving the resources to connect with employers.  It's much easier to get a job while still in college than out of college.
3.  Run your resume and cover letters off friends or family who are good at that kind of stuff.  Pay attention to details.  I bounced my resume off at least 5 people and went through at least 20 revisions since I first worked it up.
4.  Use ACTION WORDS on your resume and make it sound like you did great stuff, even if you didn't.  But don't lie.  One of my internships was a total bust and I hated talking about it, but I spiffed it up and it was actually the reason I landed my job.  The best thing I could say about it was that ""It was a great experience, it allowed me to meet a lot of great people, and I was able to see a whole'nother side of the business which was great for my development because my other internships were heavily engineering based.""  but it worked for the 3 interviewers who asked about it.  I also talked about how it helped develop my report writing and stuff like that (in addition to other things).  In reality I wrote 1 real report, 1 stupid report, went on a few trips with the office, and slept in my office all day otherwise.  My resume essentially goes: Education, Experience, Current Projects, Knowledge.  
5.  Get as many interviews as you can BEFORE the big one that you really want.  After your first two interview, the rest become MUCH easier.  I got an interview at a design company that I really wanted and it went terrible because it was my first interview in a year and was not on the ball.  That means search your job site now and start applying to anything that interests you at all.  Yeah, its stressful, but better than screwing up when it really matters.
6.  Spend time designing your resume.  I actually built mine in Illustrator with the help of my girlfriend and I think it definitely helps show pride in your work over a shitty Word template.  Word actually has decent templates now that will probably work too.  (I may edit it and send it to anyone interested if there's enough interest).
7.  Job fairs suck, I still don't think they actually helped me at all, but go anyways and talk to employers to see what they want.  Try to land an internship/job if you can obviously.  

Interviewing Tips:  Look [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cxpq8/what_are_the_dos_and_donts_of_a_job_interview/c9kyssy) for more info because this post helped me immensely.

1. Dress well. I see so many engineers dressed like slobs with clothes that don't fit or are all wrinkled.  I would be very hesitant to hire them if I were doing the hiring, because it really doesn't speak well of you.  I usually went with a light blue dress shirt, blue tie, black slacks, and dress shoes.  Make sure your pants are well fitting, and worn correctly. Seriously, this is a huge first impression and you don't want to look like a slob.  Don't wear loud stuff like red shirts. It really just looks weird.  
2.  Learn about the company, be ready to talk/ask about their products/services.  That's what most of my interviewing time was actually spent doing after the initial one.  I would just ask one of the many questions I had written down, and LISTEN to their replies, and touch on why you were happy to hear the answer they gave or why that is great for you.  The questions aren't to waste time, they are to show yourself off and allow you to understand the position and company.  Look to the next point to see where many of your questions/answers should in some way point.  
3.  Write down questions you have, why you are the best fit for the job, and why you would hire you, NOW CONVINCE YOURSELF.  Remember the list and read it to yourself because you are the shit going in and you need to convey that.  You are the best person to sell yourself and the only person to sell yourself.  **They are looking for someone who can do the job (easy), is going to work hard, stay with the company, and be a good fit with the employees.**  All your answers and questions should essentially lead back to proving this to them.  
2.  Make eye contact, say their name in the greeting, remember it, and say it in the thank you and goodbye with a solid handshake.  
3.  Ask them how their day has going, instead of awkwardly just walking to the interview room or whatever in silence.  Give them a compliment if you can on their business or maybe something you learned from their site about them.  Be genuine in your compliments.  
4.  Try to be relaxed and have fun.  Yeah, this is a stupid one, but it's important.  If you are having a hard time with this one, you should be getting as many interviews as you can early to work it off.  Sorry.  
5.  Be ready with great things to say about your past experiences.  Write them down and remember them.  Always positive, what you learned, and why that's great for them.  
6.  Talk to someone on the phone or something before going for the interview, convince them why you are excited about the interview.  It will help loosen you up and get you ready.  
7.  You should have some situations in mind for times when you were the leader (Think of a random group project where you acted as the coordinator and be ready to discuss it)

I hope you guys find these helpful because I spent a lot of time on this post!  I really dont mean to sound like a know-it-all; its all basically things that HELPED ME PERSONALLY overcome what was a huge stress in my life.

The most helpful thing for me was to make a notebook and write down why you are a great person, great employee, great fit for the company, etc and convincing myself of it.

Finally get the Dale Carnegie audiobook ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" and listen to it.  Its possibly just obvious stuff for you, but reinforces some basic fundamentals of winning people over.  The most important I have found to be genuinely complimenting people and saying their name.  People fucking love it.  ",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_1ezejb,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ezejb/just_accepted_a_job_offer_some_job_search_and/,

No matter what your major, or what you think your major will be, learn a programming language.

Everything today is moving towards simulation due to it's increase in ability to reflect what will happen in the real world, and considerably lower cost than real experiments. If you're an engineer, biologist, chemist, civil, geologist, etc, you will eventually need to learn some kind of programming language in order to complete your job.

My advice is to start early instead of waiting until you are a few years into your degree and find that you are behind the curve in a class because you don't know how to simulate your experiment in MATLAB, and are slower to pick it up because you've never seen code before.

Almost all colleges should offer an introduction to programming class(es), which should really be mandatory just like physics or chemistry.

This is only one person's advice, but after enrolling in a PhD program and attending many networking events with people of all majors, knowing a programming language is certainly a standout constant across all fields.

EDIT (From /u/Turbine_Heart): If you're not sure where to start, C and Python are both very simple to learn language that can provide incredible power in nearly any field.  There are hundreds of books and courses on both, and C might even be the language taught in your introduction to programming course.

If you have an idea of what you want to do in life, consider talking to someone a few years ahead and figuring out what is actually needed in your field.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,1374633059.0,,,True,t3_1ixds2,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ixds2/advice_to_all_students_learn_a_programming/,

**Before the Interview**

Well one of the toughest parts is over with. You have landed an interview! By preparing yourself, you can go into the interview 'battle-ready' in order to secure a job for yourself.

If you haven't already, ensure that your résumé is printed off and as up to date as possible. It may not be entirely necessary but I try and bring the following to the interview:

* Printed résumé (Ensure there is enough copies for all recruiters)
* Transcript (Whether unofficial or official, sometimes comes in handy)
* Notepad/Portfolio (For notes if necessary)
* Business Cards 
* Project Work (Haven't personally done this, but could be used to sell yourself)

Also find out about the dress code of the interview. I have had a recruiter call and tell me whatever I am wearing is fine, but other's tend to assume a business professional, while some allow business casual. 

* [About: Dress Code Help](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/interviewattire/a/interviewdress.htm)

If you can find out the recruiter's name before hand, make sure you remember it, and use it to add a personal touch to interviews. 

Find out as much as you can about the company, what they do, where they are at, what they are looking for.

And finally, know why you are interviewing with them. Just for practice? Do you really want the job? Do you like their work? Have other students said great things about them?

* [Lifehacker: Ask an Expert about the Job Search Process](http://lifehacker.com/5993164/ask-an-expert-all-about-the-job-search-process)

**During the Interview**

Check in at the location you are interviewing at least 15 minutes prior to the interview starts. 15 minutes has been good for me so far, I have showed up earlier but waited in the parking lot until 15 minutes before. Chances are the recruiter is booked until the time it begins anyway, or in another interview. Career services and other sites say don't use your cell phone while waiting, so if you can bring some printed material or have notes to review during your waiting time, that would pass the time.

When you meet the recruiter do your best to make a great first impression, this will likely set the atmosphere with in the interview.

* [Runtime-Era: My Questions for Potential Employers](http://www.runtime-era.com/2013/03/my-interview-questions-for-potential.html)

**Interview Questions**

Whether you are in a face to face interview or a phone interview, the responses that you give can make or break your case.

You can find some great questions and response ideas and thoughts here: 
* [Lifehacker: Post College Survival Guide](http://lifehacker.com/the-post-college-survival-guide-509417753)

I have had 2 interviews which have utilized the ""STAR"" method of behavioral interviews. Situation or Task, Actions, Results? 
* [STAR Method](http://www.stuaffrs.wayne.edu/resources/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf)

**Phone Interviews**

While a phone interview is in no way less important than a face to face interview, it does give you the opportunity to just talk as opposed to selling body language and such. If you do not understand a question or need further clarification on a question, feel free to ask the recruiter to repeat the question for your clarification.

With a phone interview you can also have some questions pre-answered. I find a few questions I expect and then come up with short key words that will remind me and write them down on a notecard. Then when I am approached with that question, I just find that notecard and I have my response.  

**After the Interview**

Make sure to thank the recruiter, our career services office at my school recommends a hard copy thank you letter, but with today's technology, I always compose a nice thank you email to the recruiter. It still keeps you in their memory, and some of the recruiters that I interviewed with would have made their initial cuts and decisions before they received the card in the mail. 

If you do receive an offer, congratulations! But don't accept right away unless you know it is what you want to do for sure, or if it is your go to offer. You will have time to consider the offer typically 1-2 weeks. 

If you have not yet received an offer or a no, it doesn't hurt to contact the recruiter you interviewed with to ask. In a case that I had, I received other offers before my desired offer. By calling the recruiter and letting them know it may allow them to speed up their decision a little bit. 

If you decline the offer, ensure that you do everything you can to prevent burning any bridges. Be as respectful as you can, as they took the time to interview you and go through their processes to offer you a position.

* [Lifehacker: How to Accept/Decline Job Offers](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-accept-and-decline-job-offers-498466080)


**Other Stuff**

* Ensure that your social media does not harm you in any way. You can control what you are tagged in in Facebook, and what is on your profile. Some places will care more than others. 
* Would you hire you? Think about it. If you were interviewing yourself, what qualities would you like to see as the recruiter, and what would sell it? 
* Be honest, no matter what. If you are not honest about something, the recruiter and their respective company will likely find out to begin with. 
* If you are crazy about a company, ensure you have researched it to the best of your ability. They will often have a mission/values page on their website. Using that for guidance in your answers can help you. If you are wanting to work for a company that promotes safety, incorporate safety into your interview some way.


**Summary**

There is no right or wrong formula to interviewing. If your school has mock interviews to practice that could be worthwhile if you are unsure as to what expect.

Your friends and others at school may be a resource too if they have interviewed with the company in the past.

Confidence sells.

**Best of Luck!**

I love engineering because the magic still isn't going away. 4 years in, and I'm building a big electrical system, while I have schematics and just mapped out in my head. The idea of what I hopefully get to look forward to in industry has me riddled with excitement. I'm solving physics problems that when my friends look at just simply roll their eyes and push it away, while I know how rewarding it actually is to have worked so hard to understand such complicated methods. I can't wait to hopefully be a guy who is in the industry where I can look at some cool shit that I built that works perfectly, and I'm gonna stand there, and be like, ""Yeah, bitch. You see what cool shit this thing does? Well I built that shit. Everything that I've learned since I started math when I was 7 has culminated in that, and it's fucking cool as hell.""

I just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  My job doesn't start until July, so I am considering filling my time by making beginning level engineering and FE review videos.  I was a tutor for basic physics and introduction to engineering courses for three years.  I have plenty of old videos and notes that have a proven track record of turning C students to B+ and A students.

My question is, would anyone actually watch the videos?  I plan on making around 30-40 videos that range 5-10 minutes.  They would cover a wide range of basic engineering subjects.   

For the basics:

-  Intro to Vectors

- Position/Velocity/Acceleration Intro

- Example Questions for P/V/A Problems

- Constant Acceleration

- Example Questions for Constant Acceleration

- Intro to Newton's Laws

For Forces/Moments:

- More Detailed Newton's Laws Video

- X-axis and Y-axis Forces

- Examples of Force Questions

- Friction with Examples

- Stress and Strain

- Examples of Stress and Strain

- Work/Energy

- Examples of Work and Engery

- Torque/Moments

- Examples of Torque/Moments

For Fluids:

- Density with Examples

- Pressure with Examples

- Buoyancy with Examples

- Intro to Bernoulli Equation

- Bernoulli Examples

- Continuity with Examples

For Thermal:

- Intro to Temperature Scales

- Intro to Heat

- Basic Heat Examples

- Ideal Gases with Examples

- Intro to 1st Law of Thermo

- 1st Law Examples

- Intro to 2nd Law of Thermo

- 2nd Law Examples

- Introduction to Heat Cycles

- Carnot Cycles with Examples

- Intro to Entropy

- Entropy Examples

For Electricity:

-  Electrostatics Intro

- Coulomb's Law with Examples

- Electric Fields 

- Electric Potential

- Basic Current/Resistors

- Examples of Series/Parallel Resistors

- Basic DC Circuits

- DC Circuit Examples

- Capacitors

- Examples of Capacitors

This doesn't cover all of the info I plan to hit.  I have done this before, only with a room full of students.  I am excited to possibly open my tutoring to the web for free.  I can't find a better use of my free time.  So, would you watch these videos for help or ignore them?  

I hope to finish editing the first round of videos by Friday and have a steady upload rate of 5 a week until the list above is exhausted.  I might continue past that, but I can't make any promises.  

So how about it, /r/EngineeringStudents ?  Would you be interested in these?

Two cops got out of the cruiser and then started asking me questions.

""What are you doing?"", to which I answered, ""Uhhhhhhhhhhhh going home""

""Where is that? Where are you coming from? I see you a lot in this neighborhood"" 
I answered again, ""I'm coming from the university man"" hahaha like what the fuck, it's called commuting. I live like 10 blocks from the university, of course you're gonna see me a lot. Apparently, seeing me a lot late at night was 'very suspicious'.

Anyways, on with the story. The cop talking to me was like ""This late? At 2:30 in the morning?"" 
I replied, ""Dude, I'm in engineering... I have a midterm tomorrow""


After that, they let me go, and I wrote my exam this morning.

The average Marquette engineering student takes 134 credits. That’s 134 times 16 weeks (in a semester) which equals 2,144 hours of class. Add in the time spent on homework on projects, which we’ll average at 1.5 times the amount of time in class, which brings us to a total of 5,360 hours spent on our degree. Standard starting salary without a college degree is $26,000, while average starting salary for an engineer is $62,000.  This equates to either a $6.72 pay raise every hour that is spent on homework or a $16.79 pay raise for every hour in class. There’s no job on the planet where you can get pay raises that often!

1329434583.0,102,self.EngineeringStudents,pt0zd,Found this gem on /r/Engineering over a year ago. Couldn't find the actual author. Good advice for those wondering how they're going to make it through the semester.,128,26,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pt0zd/found_this_gem_on_rengineering_over_a_year_ago/,"""**How do I motivate myself to get through the burn at the end of a semester of engineering?**

Burn everything.

Now I'm not saying burn down the building. It stems from my analogy of what engineering school is like.

You are the conductor of an old school steam train. Trying to get from point A (beginning of semester) to point B (the last final). The train is your life.

You start out, everything is fine. Burning through the coal a little faster than you would like, but it's okay. You're making good time towards the destination. But then, trouble. The first hill (Midterms Round 1) looms up in front of the train, you panic. Throwing as much coal as you can onto the fire you pay no attention to how much there is. You keep telling yourself ""I just need over this hill, just need over this hill. It's all that matters right now so I need to use as much as is needed."" Finally, disaster is averted and the train is cruising down the other side of the hill.

But the downhill is much shorter than the uphill and another hill (Midterms Round 2) is no longer ""way in the distance"". It's getting closer. Looking back in the coal car you see that you are through over half of it. Panicking you run through all the cars looking for more coal. There is none there. Every car holds your posessions, your friends, your relationships, your family. Everything you've put time into up until this moment is on the train.

You realize that if you don't get to point B, a lot of the work you have put into your life was for something you can't or didn't achieve. And that's not good. Steeling your resolve to finish what you started, you march back to the front of the train to face the next hill head on.

You hit the hill while you were busy reflecting and spending some moments with friends and family. The train has already lost momentum, it feels like it won't make it another kilometer along the tracks.

In a flash, you empty the coal car. You get out the broom and dustpan and sweep every last speck of coal into the fire. It does enough. Beat the hill.

Thinking it's over, you turn to look down the tracks. There is no downhill and the Rockies (Finals) are right in front of you. The train as it is right now will not make it over. You know this in your heart.

So you go through the cars and gather everything that you cannot live without. Your immediate family. Your best friend. Your girlfriend. Your sanity. Everything else gets left on the passenger cars. Aquaintances, your health, your sleep, your hobbies, your pride and your hopes. With a sigh of regret and a twinge of pain, you disconnect the passenger cars, leaving the dead weight that was your life behind.

The light train builds up some steam with the little fuel it has left and you prepare to hit the hill. You hit the hill. Burn everything. The carpet, the drapes, the furniture and your clothes. It's not enough.

You tell your family you'll see them later and kick them off.

You hope your best friend understands as you throw him out the back of the train (anything for that extra push).

You kiss your girlfriend goodbye and tell her you'll meet her there.

Finally, it's just you and your sanity standing naked, trying to get up the last stretch of the mountains. With a sparkle in your eye and a maniacal laugh you throw your sanity into the fire.

You get to point B. You recover as much as you can. Hell even your sanity is still alive. But it's not quite the same...it twitches occasionally and sometimes stares off into the distance, not speaking a word.

And that, my friend, is how you get through a semester of Engineering.

Dismantle your life for every scrap of motivation and work ethic you can. The valuable things will survive.""",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_pt0zd,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pt0zd/found_this_gem_on_rengineering_over_a_year_ago/,

I recently completed my first year of engineering school.

I feel an immense amount of fear -- there's really no other word for it -- when I contemplate going into engineering as a professional after I've earned my degree. This is partly because I feel like my peers are more gifted than me in a lot of ways -- I've had my struggles in my first year classes and it takes more effort for me to retain and truly understand concepts than them. 

Dedicating myself to learning the sciences has humbled me quite a bit -- I feel like there's too much information to absorb and learn. I truly feel like I know absolutely nothing about anything in my field, even though I do average or better in all of my classes. I got into engineering because I wanted to understand how the world worked on a chemical/physical level, but now that I'm here it's pretty intimidating. Being humbled is a good thing, don't get me wrong, but I don't know where to begin learning everything I'll need to learn in order to be a good engineer. I desperately want to learn more about my field ('cause materials are so fucking awesome), but I don't know where to start. I fear that everything that I'd try to read would go way over my head and I wouldn't understand it at all because I only have a basic grasp of math/chem/physics. 

I've always been a self-starter and I've loved learning about just about anything, but I'd like to go in greater depth in my field. I'm also interested in business (interning at a start-up this summer), but the sciences are where I want to ply my trade, simply because I love problem-solving and playing with things in the lab. 

Putting those two things together, I feel like I'll never be a good engineer. I feel like I'm not as good as my peers, and I don't know nearly enough about my field in order to make an impact. 

TL;DR I feel like I'm inferior to my peers and I don't know nearly as much as I'd like to about my field (materials) but I'm afraid that I wouldn't understand anything I'd read. Therefore, I fear that I'll make a shitty engineer. I realize this is an anxiety-driven post, but I've been worried about this lately. 

1) Does anyone else have this fear?

2) Any suggestions about how to get more involved in my field this summer and beyond?",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_wlh1g,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wlh1g/anyone_else_feel_like_theyll_never_be_a_good/,

I got a degree in Structural Engineering, granted this is by far not the toughest engineering discipline out there.  I worked in the field for about 5 years before I realized I just didn't have the passion for it anymore, but I'm so thankful that I was an engineer. 

In my new profession (real estate), the work ethic I learned in engineering school and the bust-your-ass mindset has helped me to be more successful in a couple of years than folks who have been in the business for decades.  This will be true in any field I get into.

Being an engineering student doesn't only teach you the greatness of thermodynamics and high level math, it teaches you to work HARD and understand that sometimes life will beat you down, but being an engineer, life's problems are just another solution you're about to solve.  Engineers can be successful in any field, but not everyone can be an engineer. Engineers are do-ers.   Engineers are problem solvers.  Engineers will ultimately be successful.  

If you're in year 3 and just getting beaten down, keep after it, no matter what, you'll come out better on the other side.

I've had engineering as my major for about 3yrs now. I went to a community college the past few semesters. I graduated with an associates of science May '12. I did not receive admission to the university i applied for. My gpa was too low (around a 2.2 or so i think.) It was that semester i realized how little i cared about school. I dont know if other people have had this experience too, but i even had advisors telling me that i needed to change my major. One said that usually people with as low gpa as mine just drop out anyways.  I've also had family problems with my dad passing away from cancer, my brother going ape shit, and I had two jobs. I was in a bad spot, but last fall i retook some math classes that i previously had a C and a D in and got a 4.0 then took a few more classes in the spring which i received a 3.7-ish i think. I just received the acceptance letter from the school who previously denied me admission. So point of the story is: If this is really what you want to do then keep trying. If your efforts don't give you what you want then change them. Also I'm sorry in advanced if this comes off as cocky and/or just to boast.

I had a heat transfer test just now on material I felt I understood really well. I've been studying my ass off and trying to save my grade as it's at a D right now, and just aced a quiz on Wednesday and had high hopes for this test.

Well every fucking question was extremly vague and you had to do a massive iteration using one of god knows how many equations. It was set up as difficulty as possible... It was way beyond the difficulty level in any of the homework problems or class problems (or textbook problems). I almost started bawling my eyes out 1/2 way through the test, I managed to regain my composure and at least finish the problems (poorly). I'm just sick of this bullshit, there is no way I'm going to pass this class now, it's not offered again until next Spring so if I fail I won't be able to take 2 classes next semester I'm enrolled in (since it's a pre-req). WHY DO THEY MAKE THIS SO FUCKING HARD, at least offer classes in the summer once in a while so every absurdly hard class doesn't set you back 500 years. Why couldn't maybe just 1 problem be an iteration and the 2 other ones be basic ones like the homework problems? Most regular majors tend to have classes every semester or during the summer... even MechE and Electrical at my school offers fucking summer classes if you fuck up, it's like my program is designed to swallow you into school for ever and ever.

Then again, they probably know better than me, they're actually engineers and I'm a dumb piece of shit. I'm ready to give up on my life, I'm 23 and won't be able to graduate until at least 2015 (which would be pushed back to 2016 if I failed HT AGAIN).

Is it competitive? Sure. But there are TONS of opportunities.

I completed an electrical engineering REU last Summer at a wonderful university, after I finished my Junior year as a Physics major. At the time I had a 2.97, and I am a white male. There are people out here who are rocking over 3's, commonly 3.4's or higher, who still think they aren't competitive enough. You are. I've heard of a guy with a 2.7 getting an internship. He got it because he applied for it. Plain and simple.

So I offer you my lone piece of advice, which I've said on here a couple times, and have told people at my college: don't be a pussy. Jump through the loops you have to. Get those letters of recommendation, professors are happy to do them. The internship I got required 3 letters of recommendation, where the majority only ask for 2, and I think that's a huge reason why I got it.

I have a bachelor's degree in engineering, but it's useless to me. I'll tell you why.


**I can't get a job.**

- I had a low GPA, and I didn't know how valuable experience/internships were so I never got one. This disqualifies me from 90% of recent graduate jobs I see.

- It's been about a year, and I'm starting to hit the ""you must have graduated &lt;8mo or &lt;12mo ago requirement, again preventing me from getting a job.

- Pretty much all other open jobs require years of experience.


I always wanted/planned to go to grad school, so I figured I'd do that if I couldn't find a job.


Well, my low GPA pretty much disqualifies me from most schools. Then I thought about getting a second bachelors in something else. Whelp, turns out most universities don't let you do that.

Now I'm stuck. My current plan is to take community college classes and keep a high GPA to hopefully help me out (either to get into grad school or a second bachelors). 

Anyway... just wanted to let yall know my story so you don't end up like me. Do well, and make sure you get an internship or something over the summer. ***It's the single most important thing you can do.*** My school didn't require it (they should have) and now I'm $60k in debt and accruing more interest than I am able to pay off because I make minimum wage/$1000 a month making fast food.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_1bwcem,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1bwcem/recent_graduate_advice_make_sure_you_get_an/,

I just got an F on an exam today and it's demolishing my motivation to continue on.  It's also making me re-evaluate whether I'm studying the correct way or not.

My problem isn't about sacrificing my social life or whatsoever.  I don't have too much of a problem spending 9am all the way till midnight on a Saturday doing work, which I've actually been doing for the past 8 weeks.  Any free time I can scavenge is taking a cat-nap, or eating meals.

The way I study is to read the text from the beginning of the chapter til the end, record notes, and do the homework.  I find that I need to 100% understand the concept before I even attempt a homework problem.  However, I'm HEAVILY behind in all my classes, despite the HOURS I'm putting in.

Something is not adding up.

I read many other posts out there, but I'd like more insight and advice on how you guys manage.  I need a new method to learn the material.  What do you put more emphasis on?  Doing actual problems and calculations?  Reading over the concepts and understanding the material?  Maybe I'm just a slow learner and can't catch up?  I'm taking 17 out of 20 credits which is fairly normal so it isn't a heavy work load.

I need a better way to manage my time.  I've been scheduling my time in excel sheets; however I find that I always fail to follow it and always need more time then the amount I allotted myself.  I understand we're all different learners... but I'd still love to hear how you guys manage to stay on top of things.  

I have many side projects I wish to work on and would also appreciate an hour or two of just playing video games once in a while.  However all my time is spend towards school work... and I'm not even doing well.  

Any response and insight is greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys.

Quick link to how I write notes.

Thanks for all the helpful comments.  I'd like to include a detailed description of my study habits so you guys can better understand what I'm doing.

For Linear Algebra, our class for some reason has completely skipped over linear transformations (a hefty amount of chapters in the textbook) and went straight to computer graphics. At first, I thought it was okay and just trusted the lecturer. However, when things got deeper, for instance when we had to figure out how to ""shear transform"" simple figures and answer questions like ""Is T 'onto' or 'one-to-one'?"", I realized ""Holy shit, we're skipping over huge amounts of material. And I'm sure you guys realize that Transformations are a huge part of the concept.

What I did to remedy the situation? KhanAcademy. Watched about 20+ videos on Saturday as well as doing the homework and reading the textbook content. This took the whole Saturday. Not kidding, the WHOLE Saturday (woke up at 9, ended around 1 or 2 am).
I'd watch a video and take notes, digest the material, then do a homework problem without any help and see if I could do it on my own.

For a class like Physics, I would read the textbook chapter from beginning to end and take notes of nearly the whole chapter (I'll include a picture of my notes to give you guys a glimpse). Many times this would be futile because I'd simply run out of time so I'd desperately start the homework. The easy problems I dont have a problem with. For the tougher problems, I would rely on Google and videos.
For classes like Material Science and Introduction to Digital Logic Design, I'd do the same thing; crack open the textbook and take notes from beginning to end. Only once I had really understood the material did I begin the homework.

My current situation? Currently heavily behind in every one of my classes and I don't have time to do my same normal note takings. This leads to the fact of me not understanding the material as well as I wish, leading me to skip lectures to go over things, meanwhile more and more material is piled up with exams around the corner and failing to review things. Soon it's exam time and I haven't done my normal ritual, so I would read the textbook in frenzy (no notetaking, only skimming).

You know, when I type my situation out, I realize my mistakes a lot more and sort of see where I have to remedy my habits. Haha. As you guys can see, I'm in a shitstorm. I also attend a school that works on Tri-Mesters (10 week quarters instead of semesters), so that definitely makes things a lot worse.

Sorry if this is unorganized and littered with grammatical errors. Sort of just typing everything out at once.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,1368581486.0,,,True,t3_1ecb9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ecb9w/failed_an_exam_yet_putting_hours_upon_hours_into/,

Essentially: join an engineering club while you're in school. Steel Bridge and Concrete Canoe are the two that I know of for Civils, we shared a machine shop with some MechE's making a car, I'm sure there are others for other disciplines that I don't know about at this point

Not only will you meet great contacts in the professional world, get to know the professor that advises the club (makes for a great letter of rec), and make some great friends and study partners, but it will give you something to talk about during an interview.

For me, the job I wanted was in bridge design. I (3.1 GPA) was interviewed against a guy that graduated Cum Laude in my class (probably 3.7 GPA). There may have been more interviewees, but he's the only one that I know of.

For the interview, I printed off CAD drawings of our bridge, gave them to my interviewers, and talked about the club for more than half of the interview. This became the easiest interview I had ever had. I talked about something I knew really well and they learned everything they would learn from those typical ""interview questions."" Before I left, they showed me around the office and introduced me to the people I would potentially work with. Two weeks later I had the job.

tl;dr, join an engineering club while you're at school and don't be afraid to hijack an interview and say ""let me show you what I've been doing outside of the classroom""

I want to spend time this summer honing in on a specific skill, but I am not sure what I want exactly. My options are: 

1) Get better at C/C++. I know a lot, but nothing too advanced.
2) Play with/program my Arduino and make cool projects and learn about it along the way. 
3) Learn Python for sheer convenience when using a computer for the rest of my life. 
4) Learn how to hack. This has been on my bucket list for a while now, but I feel like I am lacking in the cs department to do this.

I am up for anything that is going to make me a better engineer/smarter person. I enjoy CS, but am not really sure how much use it would be to put a lot of time into it.

I've only just started pure engineering, finishing up my gen eds, and its been rough.  I've been getting by with knowing that it'll get better, and the fact that I simply love airplanes (AE here).  
But twice this semester (I took a summer class, dynamics), I had a revelation that I really love this.  
The first was on a computer project we had to do.  It was difficult, but when I finished after about 4 hours, I looked back and realized that I loved it.  The problem was to model a pendulum's motion in matlab, and solve for reaction forces, and energies.  I ended up with the 4 graphs I needed, a good explanation of why they were correct, and two beautiful .m files.  
The second happened today on the plane home.  I was looking out the window, and realized I could calculate the distance the ailerons needed to be out on the wing for a given force to produce a certain angular acceleration.  I spent the next half hour delving into Euler's second law and finding moments of inertia for the wings, transferring them to the roll axis of the aircraft, and finding what moment we needed to produce an acceleration.   
It was like I finally found the practical purpose for all the stupid book problems I solved.

First, it gets you noticed. ([Read our previous posts on mistakes and how to get noticed.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/))

Next, the resume describes what you have done and starts to illustrate your abilities and personality. How is this accomplished? Through the bullet points or descriptors for your listed experiences and projects. These are the meat of your resume.

And descriptors are deceptively easy. There is only one mistake can be made with descriptors: focusing purely on macroscopic responsibilities rather than writing about real results and exactly what you, the candidate, did to accomplish those results.   

Be specific when writing your descriptors. Amazing descriptors will say exactly what you did. Do not talk in big terms of what your team or project worked on. As an example, a lot of student resumes discuss senior design. A student might write, ""Designed a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle."" That's good to know, but what does it tell an employer about the candidate? What part did you design? What new information has an employer learned about you? The answers to these questions are weak.

A stronger descriptor might read, ""Decided which hydrogen generating processes to use in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle"" or “Designed and assembled the chassis for a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.” With a description like that, hiring managers can better understand the kind of role the resume candidate played in the greater senior design project.

A good idea to keep in mind is that your reader should be able to visualize parts of your work based on the descriptors. If a visual image cannot come to mind, then perhaps your descriptors are too vague.

We can go one step further. Employers love to see the results of your hard work. Big questions to keep in mind are:

* Did I earn recognition for my work? (Awards, scholarships, certifications, publications)
* Did I save the company money or time?
* Did I develop new skills?
* Can I quantify any success?
* Can I show experience as opposed to telling it?

Using the same senior design example, one might write, “Won first place in senior design competition for Class of 2013.” Knowing that you have accomplished that validates all the work you have done on that project. Not only did you learn the necessary skills, but you did it better than anyone else.

Here are some other examples:

For a research experience, good descriptors may read, “Co-authored an article published in Lab on a Chip”(recognition), “Awarded a $1000 research grant by the university” (recognition, quantify), “Used MATLAB to simulate bacterial growth” (skills).

For work experience, good descriptors may read, “Drafted piping and instrumentation diagrams using AutoCAD” (skills, show not tell), “Streamlined plant risk management inspections by designing a more efficient inspection process” (save time), “Tested equipment to increase flue gas desulfurization by 30%” (quantify).

For extracurriculars, good descriptors may read, “Fundraised $5,000 for breast cancer research” (money, quantify), “Recruited 25 new students to the organization” (quantify), “Elected Vice President for the year 2011” (recognition, leadership skill).

Here are some descriptors from actual resumes that we would consider poor: “Supported engineering staff” (tells us nothing meaningful that the job title hasn’t already told us), “Worked with flow equipment” (worked with what kind of equipment? how and why?), “Consulted with clients to meet specifications” (what kind of specifications?), “Developed new methods and procedures to improve quality” (what kind of methods and procedures and improved by how much?), “Excellent computer proficiency” (be specific, what programs or languages do you know?).

tl;dr:

1376510809.0,55,self.EngineeringStudents,1kdcwy,If I could do it again...,75,20,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1kdcwy/if_i_could_do_it_again/,"This post is not advice for being an engineering student, but rather, what I wish I had done upon graduation.  This advice is most applicable to Mechanical and Chemical Engineers looking to work in a large chemical or petro plant, although Im sure it might apply to other manufacturing industries as well.  



If I could do it over again, I would not have taken that first $60k salaried engineering position right out of school. If I had known better, I would have found a company that I truly respect, and chosen a city that I would like to live.  Then I would have applied for an operator or maintenance mechanic position.  



Operators in most Petro/Chemical plants make up to $120k/yr with overtime and the work is usually very simple: sitting at a DCS control board, loading and unloading storages, turning valves, etc.  Mechanics are doing things like changing out valves, fixing pumps, checking lubrication, repairing leaks, and much more.  Both of these roles would provide you with the best experience you could ever ask for - experience that would make you a top-notch engineer.  Also, most companies dont even require their operators to have a college degree, so having an engineering degree would make you extremely over-qualified.  The downside to be an operator is that the hours are rough: 12 hour shifts sometimes alternating between day and night on 4 day swing schedules.  However, you do get several days off in between shift swings.  If you are willing to put in the hours, being an operator is entirely worthwhile.  To be completely honest, as an operator you could do engineering design and drafting work at your computer while on shift.  You could impress the shit out of your superiors very easily.  In the end you will make a ton of money, you will save a ton of money (because you cant spend it because you will be working all the time), and you will develop an intimate relationship with the other operators and the equipment of your plant, which is awesome because helpful operators can make a world of difference for an engineer.



After a year or so of operations or working as a mechanic, I would apply for an engineering role at the same plant.  I would do so with great knowledge about the plant and the operations, which is invaluable information for an engineer.  Knowing everything about the plant already would pretty much guarantee me the position.  I would have great relationships with the other operators, who are the people that truly get shit done in a plant.  The salaried management would already respect me because of the safety and monetary impacts I had on the operations of my unit (something any of us would be capable of doing being an engineer in a blue collar role).  



And the best part.  I also will have $50,000+ cash in the bank.  Personally, with this money I would purchase a couple of rental properties that would basically pay for my own rent/mortgage and maybe a car payment.  That basically would allow me to save all of my new engineering salary (or spend it on vacations, booze and strippers if thats your thing).  And I can pretty much guarantee that that new engineering salary will be more than the $60k you would have gotten right out of school. 



If someone had told me to do this a year a go I would have jumped on it.  Especially with the job market being so cut-throat right now for engineers.  Work hard for a year, then sit back and let the success role in.



Apologies for the changing I/You subject of the paragraphs.  You know what I mean.

After that, I take a few minutes to get ready for the next morning and get to bed.

I wake up around 7 every morning and generally don't take naps during the day, so I should be (and usually am) exhausted by this time. My problem is that I can never actually fall asleep without lying in bed for several hours. I feel like it's because I can't switch off from ""work mode"", as I constantly find myself making lists of things I need to do or thinking about my schoolwork, etc. So usually I don't fall asleep until 2 or 3. Sleeping in past 7 on these mornings isn't an option, I have classes at 8 am every day. The days I don't get enough sleep, I'm incredibly tired during the day but still have this problem at night. I usually end up using Saturday and Sunday to catch up on my sleep, but I'd rather not need to.

Does anyone else have problems like this? How can I detach myself from schoolwork (despite having spent all my waking hours immersed in it) so I can actually relax and fall asleep?

I don't know if it's okay to post this here but I need some advice. 
There is a girl in one of my engineering classes and I have a HUGE crush on her. I'm daydreaming about this girl 24X7. The problem is that we're both electrical engineering majors and will probably have a shit load of classes together so I don't want to ask her out and make it awkward. Also, she sits in front of the class and is surrounded by guys that seem to know her pretty well. I can overhear their conversations because it's a small class and she's always joking around with them. I never see her alone, she's always with some guy in our program, so its hard to get to know her better. (The class doesn't have assigned seats but everyone sits in the seats that they have had since the first week of class, but the seat next to her is empty.)

Now that the first midterm has been returned, some of you may be asking yourself if you should drop ME242. Here are a few things to consider:

1) Your overall grade reflects both the exam and the homework. 

2) If you drop the course now, you will almost certainly take an extra semester to graduate. That equates to about $30,000 in lost salary. If someone paid you $30,000 to pass ME242, could you do it? 

3) ALL students can pass ME242 if they put in enough time (albeit some students need more time than others). Ask yourself if you can find another hour everyday to study by giving up something else (again, think in terms of the $30,000 payoff - if someone paid you $30,000 to study instead of watch TV or hang out with friends, could you do it?).

4) If you really don't think you can pass, then you also have to consider that I am teaching ME242 in the fall also. This may be good (same notes, similar exams, etc.) or bad (if you don't like my teaching style or think I'm harder than the other professors).

5) You may be like many students and just cannot find enough time to work, study, spend time with family, etc. If this is the case, you may have taken on too many responsibilities. In this case, dropping is probably the best course of action - but don't delude yourself into thinking you can still graduate in 4 (or even 5) years. The fact that you are very busy this semester is not likely to change in the future.

6) Last day to drop a class is next Friday (March 23rd).

I know this is a tough decision for many students. In the end, make your decision based on the facts not emotion. That's what engineers do!",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_qwcnm,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qwcnm/thinking_of_dropping_a_class_think_again/,

I'll start by explaining my background and then what I'm seeing that spurred the post.

Background about me:

Spent 4 years at community college programs in Drafting and in Machine Tools so yeah I have 2 AAS Degrees. Currently working towards a BS in Mechanical Engineering Tech as it's less time for me to finish than BSME. I've used... Paper, AutoCAD ('06-'11), Autodesk Inventor, Solidworks '06-'09, CATIA V5, UG NX 7.5, ProE 4.0, and MasterCAM (9-X4). Out of those software packages the one's I've used really extensively are AutoCAD (Modeling, Drawing), Solidworks 2009 (Modeling, Surfacing, Drawing, basic FEA), and NX 7.5 (Modeling, Routing, FEA, CAM).

TL,DR: I've spent a shit-ton of time at a workstation on a ton of different software packages.

What am I telling you?

I see at least once every 3 days a post entitled something like ""I want to learn AutoCAD (Solidworks, CATIA, UG, Matlab)."" Lately it seems every time I just slam my head on the desk. The only answer you are going to find is that you just need to use the software. I cannot teach you AutoCAD just so that you learn AutoCAD. I remember taking ""Intro to AutoCAD"" which was something like 8 hours a week lab time plus homework. At the end I could competently use AutoCAD but then as I got further into classes in GD&amp;T, Tool &amp; Die Design, and others I still had to go back and look up things I didn't know. I built familiarity through using the software. There is no golden book for any software that can really teach you that package as well as you sitting at a computer and using the software.

Also remember that some of these software packages have so many modules that it's nearly insane to try to learn that software. Like if someone said ""Teach me UG."" I know absolutely nothing about ship-building so there's a few modules in there I wouldn't have the slightest idea how to utilize. For a non-electrical guy what about the CircuitWorks package in Solidworks... useless.

So what's my advice?

If you want to learn a software start using it. Ask yourself what you want to do with that software such as do you want to model a stamping die, perform static structural analysis, or do the tool paths for a 4-axis WireEDM machine and post the code? Consider if someone asked you to ""Learn Matlab!"" Well there's modules there for everything from Electronics to Economics.

The thing is that software in the engineering world is so vast in it's capability anymore that learning with just the intent to learn will lead to nothing. You need to know what you want to do with the software. Learn how to do that task.

As a final word I'm going to say if you are unable to designate what you want to DO with a software then maybe learning the software isn't the best use of your time and you should back up a bit.

The fun of summer has ended and another term is looming dark over our heads. Maybe summer wasn’t so fun for you and you decided to take courses to try and make up for goofing around your freshman year. Maybe (if you are like me) you needed to retake a course so that you could move on.  Maybe, you didn’t fair so hot this term (or last, or next term) and are considering changing majors.
Well, before you do this, let me offer some words of advice.  If you don’t truly love engineering, get the fuck out.  This pretty much goes for anything you do in life. If you don’t love what you do, find something to do that you love. Life is too expensive to waste doing shit you hate.  


For those of you that are still here, and are saying that you love what you are studying, that getting that engineering degree is your dream, then welcome to my world.  If you are in a position where you are wondering if you should give up that dream, DON’T. Make your school force you out. Even then, see if there is a way around them forcing you out. Did you fail physics three times and are facing removal from your engineering program? Find out if there is a community college that you can transfer in to, knock out the physics (or whatever classes you can) and get back into your primary school and get back on track. Not only will you be able to move on, but you will save some cash for classes as well.  Are you on the verge of failing out? Fuck a social life, study…study…study. Get tutoring, get a Schaum’s guide, do something so that you can stay in your program.

My point here is, don’t give up on yourself, or your dream. If this is what you truly want, make the sacrifice and GET IT DONE. If you quit, you will always look back and wonder “what if”.  And that is a shitty position to be in….

These have been extremely valuable me in past semesters, in which I have used them to augment my classes, and I am currently using a similar method to prepare for upcoming classes (E&amp;M, Calc III, etc). 

Ideally, my idea is to expand what I already have to cover most essential STEM classes - think something like MIT OCW, where each concept has a section with associated videos, problem sets, recommended homework assignments, etc - but not restricted to a single source or institution and sort of ""crowd sourced"" to get some of the most useful or insightful resources all linked from one place.

My question is this - would anyone be interested in a project dedicated to compiling these kinds of resources and making them freely available online somewhere for people who either 

A) Want a structured way to teach themselves a subject or 

B) Wish to prepare for upcoming classes?


Sorry for the length of the post, but tl;dr: 

Anyone interested in putting together open-source versions of various math/science/engineering courses?

Hopefully this can be inspiration for someone else.",67,20,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1f8o3u/my_path_so_far_sophomore_in_mechanical/,"I've been in college for the past 3 years, 2 of which were at the community college. I am 24. I was, and still am, close friends with the top 10%ers (as a 50%er) in High School and I have seen them graduate from prestigious universities across the countries with degrees in Engineering, Business, and Science. I was the only one of my graduating class at an all boys catholic school to not go straight to university and opted instead to move to Austin for IT work. I found a good job and made a decent salary but I began to realize if I truly wanted every opportunity in life I would need a ""real"" degree. 

Thus began my journey back to school. 

I had wanted to go back the last year I was in Austin but between money, not having a car, and a precarious health situation, I never did. In the Winter of 2010 I was admitted to the hospital and spent the next 5 days there recovering from what I later found out is Crohn's disease. My parents being supportive of me and wanting to help me succeed allowed me to move back in with them and paid for my tuition at San Antonio College (SAC). 

For the next 2 years, I took 9 hour semesters as well as light summer classes due to stress being a major cause of my health problems and slowly but surely got back into the swing of things. Starting in Remedial math (as I correctly answered 5/25 preliminary test questions) I relearned everything. I took algebra I twice, pre-calculus three times, and Calculus I/II once (at university). My favorite class at SAC was the intro to engineering course, taught by a professor from eastern Europe who looked and sounded like the old man in despicable me and had no tolerance for excuses. His class convinced me that I do want to be an engineer and that I will not stop until I have the degree.

I have not taken a traditional path in the slightest and I believe this is what worked for me. If you asked me in high school what I wanted to go to school for I would have said Doctor or Businessman, never giving Engineering a thought. If it wasn't for my professor, I would likely be aiming for those degrees. He inspired me to challenge myself and although I have always struggled with math, now I know it is because I was not applying myself fully. 

You don't have to be the brightest individual to be an engineer, you just have to work hard. You have to want it. Freshman year at university was the hardest I have ever worked at something and the rewards are there. I know I have a long ways to go and I am ready for the challenges. I am a part of the FSAE and do IT work for the Valero Energy HQ. My goals are clear and everything I do is geared towards them. 

My main point is this, never stop trying at anything. Learn from your mistakes and make personal changes to be better. I know I still have a long ways to go and I am determined to succeed. Reading posts in this subreddit has helped tremendously, especially during finals week (good motivation to get off reddit), and I hope this post can add something positive.

I knew everything that was supposed to be on it. I could pretty much teach it to someone else off the top of my head. However, when I got there, the pressure that had built up to that point finally got to me. The first question was 40% of the test grade, and naturally it was very long. the only thing I could think of was whether or not I would have the time to finish it and the other two questions within the time limit. Eventually (after 40 minutes out of 75 total) I realized that I was not able to concentrate and I finished the other two questions. When the teacher returned and said we had 5 more minutes, I shut down, nothing was working. I turned in a test with no answer for the first question, and a bunch of incoherent work that I had lost track of.

I returned to my room and rewrote the problem, and it only took me 10 minutes to lay out the problem and everything I had to do to get the answer... but it didn't matter, It was too late.

I was expecting a 100% on that test, and if I had just been able to relax I am confident I would have managed it. now I will be lucky to get a 60%

I don't know, I am mostly depressed right now. I might feel better tomorrow when I forget about it, but the worst thoughts are going through my head.

I mostly just feel the need to rant, but how do you guys deal with such unexpected setbacks? any advice that might prevent such an instance from ever happening again might help.

____
TLDR: I had a test that I probably failed when I should have aced it because I let the pressure get to me and I couldn't relax. any advice?

_____

Thanks for the responses. They certainly made me feel better.

I used to go into every exam saying ""fuck it"", but for some reason it is hard to say that about my ME courses, since here I am limited to 10 semesters before I cannot graduate. with Thermo, failing to achieve a C can set me back a year. with 4 down and a terrible GPA, I understand where my testing anxiety is coming from.

Oh well, time to think ahead to see if I can salvage my grade

In our conversations, there is one piece of advice I always give:  **Do everything in vectors**.  So often, when I see them working on physics, statics or dynamics homework, the first thing I see them do is attempt to change everything into a collection of scalars.  This is the realm of numbers in which they seem to feel comfortable, and they are just unwilling to work out a multidimensional problem using vector methods.

Some members of this group will freeze up and admit that they don't know how to do it any other way.  This is a big complaint I have with my school--too many of the instructors show little shortcuts that allow translation into scalar operators.  It gives the students the impression that vectors were something invented by mathematicians just for the hell of it, or to make things harder than they really are, so they grow to resent it.

Other students tell me that they should do ""whatever's easier"", and although I prefer vectors, they prefer to stick with making conversions into scalar form.  To these people, I argue that they may get their homework done with less thought if they make these conversions, but they're missing out on the big picture...

Without accepting vector phenomena as such, one misses a tremendous number of connections between one's different classes.  A cross product, for instance, is an operation that has very big physical implications, and can tell us a lot about a phenomenon.  Taking a cross product tell us things that ""ABsinΦ"" never will.  I see people use ABsinΦ, and then they can't even tell me which direction the cross product points.  This is no surprise, since they just performed a scalar operation.

So, if anybody is looking for advice, just do the problems the way that corresponds with how they work in the real world.  As much as you may want it to, the entire physical world does not reduce down to one-dimensional phenomena.  If you want to understand it and make predictions, you need to use the language that accurately represents it.  Once you start doing this, you will begin to realize what these operations actually do, and your understanding WILL propagate through all your courses.  You're going to be using a calculator anyway, so it's not like you need to worry about heavily involved arithmetic.  Speak the right language, and you will begin to understand things much better.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,t3_smwvz,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/smwvz/my_one_piece_of_advice_to_beginning_engineering/,

Optimization and method questioning will hit our backs like salty lava chains but we will provide angelic responses which promise overall feasibility. We will know their coal-fired plant as well as they do. We will pour over their current environmental investments, and sing hymns of ""why not more"". Ever hinting at the crippling omen of cap and trade which will cost them. Dearly it will cost them, $75,000 every hour. every day. every week. every month. every year. So why take that risk? Why? The answer is here, we have it. Take it. 

Then, after it ends... the sweetest part of all. Is when I'll go back home. Read over that 103 page report one last time, remember the numerous nights I would spend working... only to have that work analyzed and deleted by others. I don't mind, I did the same to them. I would savagely rip those paragraphs from sections and yell at their existence and evaluate their worth, eventually chucking them out of existence. Never thinking about how many hours others may have spent creating them, only growling at how many hours they didn't spend.

Such a beautiful note could only be provided by an obese opera singing woman to signify! The inevitable was happening! It's happening! It's ending!

As the last notes drift off, the soft strings of the violin will guide me to close my laptop. With a clear head I will stretch as if waking from a year long slumber. My back will crack as if I were malformed to resemble a troglodyte and I was just now putting it back in place. I will look up to the ceiling then close my eyes and softly whisper to myself ""da fuq was that""


EDIT: Some background information

For those curious, it's still being processed as we speak (technically I need to be editing right now). It's up to 120 pages at this point. Without the appendices and the table of contents, the report is around 70 pages. There's about 40 pages of equations, citations, tables, graphs, and diagrams. The project was a FEED study of utilizing micro-algae as a carbon sink for a coal-fired power plant. There was the technical side of designing a pilot scale and performing a techno-economic analysis. Plus a biological side where algae strains were selected based on the area's environment. The spacing is 1.0, we were really scared when we were compiling it and it was around 160 pages before ripping out sections. We were joking that it would be a proper door stop for the company that enlisted us for help.  

It was a group project, so I wasn't the only one working on it. We realized that the length of the document would threaten it's potential for being read so we decided on writing an executive summary. Coincidentally, I had just finished writing the executive summary when I submitted this. I was kind of sleep deprived so you are mostly reading the ramblings of a mad man. This has actually served as good feedback!

They are PDF's of Foundation mathematics for engineers and Analytical methods for engineers.

The foundation is extremely helpful when needing to refresh or referring back to the basics, it's a good, lengthy work-through if you are not great at maths and could do with the extra help. 

The analytical covers pretty much common ground mathematics such as algebraic methods, trigonometry,calculus and statistics and probability. 

Will get them uploaded somewhere if there is any interest.

Am I doomed?,56,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/12is00/about_to_graduate_with_a_masters_in_aerospace_yet/,"(Note: I don't live in the U.S.)

 I went into college at 16 and during high school I had this delusion that I was going to become an astronaut so I decided to go into an Integrated Master's in Aerospace Engineering. I started disliking it and getting mediocre results but everyone around me kept advising ""Don't worry! The early years are mostly weed out courses and generic stuff! The fun comes later!"". Well the ""fun"" never came and I was stuck in this damn course since I didn't want to graduate at 30 (and yet ended up taking 8 years to complete a 5 year degree). 

I tried getting internships but no one accepted me, not even unpaid ones for some reason. I also chose the Avionics specialization which though it had more interesting courses I feel was too scattershot: I just learned a bunch of isolated classes on electronics, signal processing, etc, without going into any sort of necessary depth to actually CREATE something (this university while the best in my country is also infamously theoretical, leading to the common joke that all their engineering degrees are actually math degrees). 

Meanwhile, it seems every single job opening is looking for stress engineers, which require skills I do not have. I have a relative in Norway who oddly enough keeps saying that there are PLENTY of jobs there and that they even PREFER people with no job experience since they don't have any previous ""habits"". Naturally this goes against EVERYTHING I hear on the news. I applied to a bunch of jobs but always get either no answer or a rejection letter. ...so should I seek my career somewhere else? I found that I enjoy programming but again, I feel like I haven't learned enough to do anything useful and by the time I get anywhere, I'm probably too old (the field is notoriously biased towards the young).

I feel like I ruined my life and want some honest advice on what's my best bet (even if it includes stuff like ""Go work as a janitor"" or something).

Is this just my experience? (I was a psych major at a small college before transferring to engineering at a large university.) Are engineers usually complainers? Is it the size of the program (more people accepted = more different levels of commitment)? Is it the fact that they're mostly 19-year-old sophomores and I'm a 23-yr-old transfer student?

I don't need to be surrounded by honor students who live in the library, but I feel disappointed that my peers aren't excited about studying engineering and broadening their knowledge. (Sometimes I just want to ask, why the hell are you even here?!)

S/he has some valid points, and us mods agree with the general consensus of that discussion.  So, I'd like to clarify/modify (though not much of a modification, really) the homework help policy here.

Homework help is welcome here, within the guidelines of this post.  We aren't exactly flooded with help requests, but if that does become a problem, we can reconsider the whole thing.  

Simply posting an entire assignment or group of problems and saying, ""help plz,"" will result in the post being removed and/or downvoted into oblivion (that's everyone's job).  Beyond the laziness issue, it's an ethical issue, as it's clear that you won't be learning the material you need to know to become a competent engineer.

But, if you have a specific question(s) about a specific problem, follow these guidelines:

1. State the problem clearly and concisely, or better yet, scan an image of it.  If you're expected to use specific design or solving methods or design guidelines (like ACI 318), state that.  
2. State what you do and don't understand.
3. State what you have tried already, and at what points you encountered trouble.
4. Don't give any deadlines for responses.  Even if you don't get a response in time before the assignment is due, a response could come later that will still help you understand the problem.  Ultimately, understanding the problem is more important than the grade.

And finally, if one person is posting HW help requests way more than average (like every assignment), I think the more appropriate way to help would be to discuss ways to get help through more traditional paths (like a tutor).  I'm not saying you can't ask more than once, but if there's a way to help out in the long run, that's more beneficial.

That should be all.  I think it's all pretty fair.

tl;dr - read it, that's your homework assignment from me

A Quick report.",49,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1enlea/studying_engineering_in_denmark_at_aau_a_quick/,"Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1emi7p/studying_engineering_in_germany_a_quick_report/) I decided to write up a small post about studying engineering in Denmark, namely at Aalborg University. I decided to include my university in the post title since things are done very differently here, compared to both other universities in other countries, but also in Denmark.

**About the university**

Aalborg University focuses on Problem Based Learning and group work. This means that every semester starts with forming groups between 7 and 2 persons, depending on the semester (higher semester usually means fewer people in a group). The groups each chose a project and are assigned a supervisor.

**About myself**

In denmark it is considered the norm to take both a bachelors and a masters, usually in direct extension of each other. Therefore I finished my bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in signal processing, and then proceeded to start my masters in Control and Automation, where I'm currently on my 2nd ( or 8th) semester.

**The common semester**

Each semester consists of 3 courses and a project. Most courses are pass-fail and all exams are open book, open notes. You are allowed to bring and use pretty much everything at an exam, except the internet. This also applies for oral exams.

The projects are group projects and should fill about half the time each semester. They are graded and are usually the only grade you get for a semester. They often involve contact with a company, where the company proposes projects and the students analyze and solves their problems. This usually (~8/10 times i expect) result in some form of implementation.

We have a fall and spring semester. The fall semester lasts from 1st of September untill the 22nd of December. Then there's a winterbreak until January where the exams are carried out. The spring semester then starts the 1st of February and lasts untill late May, with exams in June.

**Courses**

Each lecture usually takes 4 hours - 2 hours of lecture, then 2 hours of work. During the working time the students go to their rooms and work on the problems posed by the professor. The professor will go from group room to group room to ask the students if they have any questions.

There is no turn-in homework, and it's completely up to the students themselves wether they want to read for a lecture or not. Most do read though, since there it usually makes the problem solving a lot easier.

There are usually no office hours for professors - rather students are encouraged to swing by the professors office any time and ask questions if they have any. If the professors aren't there we usually just write them an email or check by later.

**Projects**

There's always atleast one professor assigned to a given student group, but sometimes a Ph.D.-student will help aswell, if the project is within their field.

Every student group have their own room with blackboards, tables and chairs, which they can decorate as they please. They have a key for their room, so they can leave their stuff there. This stuff usually include a fridge, a microwave, a coffee machine and extra monitors for their laptops.

The students are expected to analyze the problem they have chosen and to write up a requirementspecification. They are then to apply the knowledge they gain through their courses to their project. That means that all knowledge learned in courses usually becomes immidiately applied. This also gives a huge incentive to show up for courses, as the knowledge gained is sometimes vital to move on with the project.

The projectwork is usually treated more as work, rather than school, meaning that pretty much all students meet at 8 and leave at 16:15, on a normal day. There's usually a supervisor meeting scheduled around once pr week.

**Tuition** 

As education is completely paid by the government in Denmark, there is no tuition. Instead most students are paid around $1000 pr month to cover living and education expenses (books etc.). This is usually sufficient to live off, but most students have some sort of part time job besides their studies.

**Housing**

There are very few classical dorms available. Most students live in their own apartments. There are however special students appartments available, which are usually small but cheap and provice all required living facilities (kitchen, bathroom, internet etc.)

**TL;DR**: Few courses, lots of project work and implementation.

Wow. That wasn't short at all.

1368958699.0,36,self.EngineeringStudents,1emi7p,Studying Engineering in germany. A Quick report.,47,11,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1emi7p/studying_engineering_in_germany_a_quick_report/,"Hi guys!
I thought i'd take a couple of minutes to give you a rough idea what it's like to study engineering in germany, mainly because I find that it is quite different from studying in the U.S. from what i read here.

**General:**
I study chemE with focus on biotechnology at one of the [TU9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU9). I am currently in my sixth semester working on my Bachelor's thesis. I'm an active member of the students council and help other students with whatever they need to be successful in their studies.
**Edit:** In Germany it is absolutely uncommon not to get a master's degree. We had the ""Diplom"" before and as that took about 5 years, one is hardly considered a fully educated engineer without a master's degree. There are positions for bachelor's graduates tough, and also special combined programs working closely with industrial partners where you are part time at work in the company and part time at university and work full time once you got your bsc.

**Semester times:**
We have two semesters a year. Wintersemester from October through March, summersemester from april through september. Approximately half of that is filled with lectures. As a rule it should take 6 semesters to get your BSC, one of which is your thesis. Enrollment for most engineering programs only in the wintersemester.


**Lectures:**
We have approximately 6 different lectures per semester. Some of them come with extra classes where a TA shows how to solve problems and/or tutoring where you can solve problems yourself in small groups. Generally it is good advice to go to lectures and take exams in the order designed by the school. There are hardly any classes where attending is mandatory. Nearly all lectures are taught in german only. (There is a mechE program completely in english tough, and us chemE's have the same maths classes, so you could go ahead and attend those)


**Exams:**
Very unlike what I read here very often about a designated 'finals week' our exams are spread out over the entire time of the semester where there are no lectures. (I have had as little as a friday+weekend entirely free time after my second semester, most was about 4 weeks) This makes for about 2 weeks of studying time for each exam. This may seem odd to you, but from my experience, there are hardly any students that would pass the exams with significantly less time (they are frickin hard). Most exams are closed book closed notes but with formula sheets+ calculator. (Eg thermodynamics I + II closed book, closed notes, calc, formula sheet; higher mathematics i + II + III: lecturescript including notes + one published mathematical piece of literature + formula book + no calculator).


**Tuition:**
There is no tuition at most public universities. There is a relatively small administration fee (about 250€ per semester).


**Housing:**
There are dormrooms for as little as 150€ a month (9 m^2, including warm water and internet). Most people don't live in dorms, as there are not enough rooms available.


**Personal remarks:**
I am currently looking for an Internship abroad; unfortunately I want to intern during the winter. That makes it somewhat harder...


**TL;DR:**
Studying engineering in germany is quite different.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!

I did pretty well in my general introduction classes but once I started taking those engineering classes, I really got destroyed. The last few years of college can be characterized as terrible studying habits and very little commitment to school. GPA of 2.6 (major GPA being around 2.0) and multiple class retakes. I've done a few internships here and there but ag engineering being a small field, I have never scored a legitimate engineering internships. I've done a summer internship at a lab on campus, did some shadowing of an agricultural engineer with the USDA, and recently been working on my school's student farm. Now that I'm close to graduating (Fall of 2012) I'm now really starting to get worried. Phrases like ""GPA's don't matter"" or ""even the dumbest engr grad is an engineer"" gets thrown around here, but give it to me straight [1] /r/engineeringstudents. How fucked am I?

What can I do from here? Should I just spam my resume all around to test my luck? Anybody with similar stories?

1347137138.0,38,self.EngineeringStudents,zkkea,Tips for Seniors who want to avoid unemployment.,41,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zkkea/tips_for_seniors_who_want_to_avoid_unemployment/,"Just a little background, I graduated in May with a solid GPA (3.3), but 0 internships and very little CAE experience. This made it very difficult for me to even get an interview. After months of improvement, knowledge, and perseverance I finally landed a dream job with a great offer. Unemployment was a miserable and depressing experience, however, I learned a lot a long the way. I kept finding myself saying ""fuck, I wish I would;ve known to do that"". I'm sure you've heard a lot of these, but I think it's more helpful to hear from someone who recently wen through first hand.


* Hopefully I'm not too late for this one, if you have the choice, choose your senior design project wisely. If you have no internship experience, this will be your major talking point. Make sure it's a project that you are interested in. Do good work and maintain a professional but also personal relationship with your company contact. Many people get job offers through this. This is especially important if you have a less than desirable GPA. They won't care about your GPA if you demonstrated your can produce good work. Even if they can't offer something you have added someone to your network.


* This one is obvious, but go to any career fair your school offers, even if you want to work in another geographic location. It will give you valuable interview experience. Also research the companies beforehand, to give you a talking point. This will also allow you to speak about any other location you are interested in.


* Start skimming job postings now. This is extremely helpful. See what types of opportunities are out there. For example, if you are an ME, you can be in multiple types of design, aeronautics, HVAC, testing, manufacturing and the list goes on. Once you see exactly what's out there, research and decide types are best suited for you. Then, look at the common qualifications associated and use the remainder of your year building towards them. For example, if you want to be a manufacturing engineer, take a production engineering class your last semester and gain a working knowledge of any program commonly listed in job postings. This will go miles.


* Start seriously applying right before your final semester. Like anything, you will get better at job hunting/interviewing the longer you do it. If you start early it gives you more time to figure it all out. 


* I personally recommend using engineerjobs.com as my main job search tool. It compiles searches from multiple job hunting sites. Craigslist is my #2. Nobody thinks of getting an engineering job on craigslist, but they are certainly out there. You have a much higher chance of getting a response, because less people apply, and your resume goes straight to the correct person.


* Develop a somewhat personal relationship with a couple professors. You don't have to kiss ass or work as their research assistant, just be a good student and a alright guy in their eyes. This is easier senior year as classes are smaller and professors tend to respect you a little more. Companies often ask professors for recommendations. As long as you ask them, they may be able to recommend you.

* If you have any sort of connections, utilize them. You can get a lot in life by simply asking.

* Update/Improve your cover letter/resume every few weeks. Just like doing a tough problem, sometimes just walking away from and later returning can really help. I can't tell you how many times I revised my resume/cover letter and said to myself ""well that's as good as I can possibly do."" only to come back 2 weeks later and saying ""wow I can definitely improve this area."" Also try to make your cover letter semi custom. I had a template and just went off that for every posting. My cover letter was 85% the same every time, but it still had that personalized feel.

* One more thing. Go back and skim any labs or projects that you have done in your Jr and Sr year just to jog your memory on what you actually did. Every once in awhile an interviewer will ask you about your experience with something. A lot of times you can use your experience with a simple lab or project to talk about. They eat that shit up. It's what got me an on site interview with the job I recently got. 


Cold calling/emailing random companies didn't seem to help. In my experience 90% don't answer and the other 10% turned me down, so don't waste your time.


There are a few more that are slipping my mind, This was more geared towards someone who who doesn't have a great GPA, internship experience or connections. I know it's not great, but it's something.

UCSD has this thing where you can get your master's a year after getting your undergrad degree. Is that worth it? Benefit is less time needed.

Now, I decided I want to go to university and study to become an engineer. I'm doing the 4 highschool requirements I need, online through correspondence.

I was elated to accept a position from Honda in their Materials science R&amp;D dept about a month ago but today I found out I got accepted at NASA, as well. Here's some comparison, then my opinions afterward.

Honda:
Location: Columbus, OH

NASA:

* Out of the five classes I'm currently taking, two are the heaviest workloads in the entire degree (Software Engineering). Four or them involve massive group projects.

* In two of these groups I'm teamed with students so woefully incompetent that I basically have to do ALL of the work. This isn't a control freak thing, I'm not exaggerating - the other students cannot get a quantum amount of useful work done even in the face of missed deadlines and repeated reprimand by the profs.

* I have severe ADHD, which means I have to kick myself in the ass every day just to get out of bed and do something productive. It also means that I take amphetamines daily, and I sometimes work way beyond what is healthy.

* I've already suffered a nervous breakdown once six years ago, took about six months to recover enough to be functional, and two years to recover fully. Worst time of my life by any measurable criterion.

* It's been two months since I haven't done anything significantly not school-related. Only exception was yesterday, when in the face of enormous amounts of urgent homework I basically said ""fuck it"" and played a shitty video game all day long. The rest of the time I basically just do school work.

* Since the start of the semester until about two weeks ago, I managed to do all the work required in 60-70 hours per week. Two weeks ago, two group projects started on top of what I'd already been doing, and I've been caught doing all-nighters just to meet deadlines. 

* I live with my girlfriend, she's my main avenue for moral support right now. She's felt a heavy toll from this and almost broke up with me after the first month because we're basically strangers in the same house. I basically see her thirty minutes per day and I can't keep up with the housework.

Basically, I'm always on the verge of crying. I can't sleep at night without copious amounts of melatonin. I feel like I can't do it anymore, yet the semester ends in four weeks. Sounds short and easy, but it also means that I have four weeks to get all my group projects to a conclusion, and that doesn't look like it's happening because my teammates are complete fucktards and the workloads are ridiculous.

I could just give up on it all and fail all my classes, but then I'm already sick and tired and that would have all been for nothing. Yet I feel that if I soldier on I'm going to have bad surprises.

The other possibility is to take a ""alea jacta est"" approach, just put in the work that I feel like putting in and whatever happens happens. That's what's happening right now, but I'm scared it could cause trouble with the few of my teammates who are functional (""what do you mean, you couldn't get your part done?"")

I've already missed a deadline today, basically have jack shit to hand in (fortunately it's individual work). I feel like my control on things is slipping, and I'm sort of scared of what'll happen next.

A few weeks ago I posted a link asking if there was any interest in a Reddit FE/EIT review.
  
I wanted to update you all that I will start making posts this month! I aim for one post/video a day. I plan to briefly review topics on the general portion of the exam and to focus on how to solve problems using your calculator. The calculators permitted on the exam are very powerful and can solve nearly every problem on the exam (e.g. quick linear regression for thermo problems, determinants for linear algebra, integration, stat functions, etc.)
  
The calculator I will be using is the Ti-36X Pro.  
  
I will make posts here, but don't wish to flood this subreddit, so posts will be xposted [r/FEreview](http://www.reddit.com/r/fereview) in case. This way, FE tutoring can be community driven and posts can be consolidated in one subreddit.
  
Let me know what you think and if you have any questions or suggestions regarding the first review post.
  
Until then, the lesson will introduce you to the basic functions of the calculator, how to store values in variables, how to review stored values, and how this small function can change your life!

I feel like I was lied to about how my education would open doors. I feel like I was actively deceived about prospects for new grads. I was told if I did well I would have employers fighting over me. Nobody told me I *had* to have a co-op to do anything more than stack soup cans on shelves. Nobody told me I *had* to take the FE exam to be competitive. Nobody told me I *had* to go suck some professor’s dick to get network “contacts.” The “contacts” I do have won't respond, or haven't been of much help.

I feel trapped, hopeless, and worthless, as I see all of my peers advance leaps and bounds ahead of me in every way. Every day, as I wade through hundreds of so called “entry level” openings, I feel like I am inches away from bawling my eyes out. I am smart, I am driven, the work I do is *damn good*, and I don't stop until it is the very best I can do. I want to be the guy that kicks ass at work, and I know that I can be. I want to earn my place, to prove myself. And yet nobody will give me the time of day. 

If I apply online, the computer most often throws me out. I can stuff my resume with all the secret codewords, and hope I make it to a phone interview. Then I try my best to be professional as I explain why I didn't work summers (to care for my Mom with cancer), why I didn't pick up a co-op (I needed to graduate asap to help out the family), why I didn't have a job at any point in my life (dying mother = no money; no money = no car;  no car = no job). I feel each step of my life was a choice, weighed and selected in logical steps, doing the best with the situation I had. But it doesn't work. I wont beg; I don’t want to be given a job based on some sob story about the kid and his dead mom. I want to be recognized as a good candidate based on my credentials.

And this is the worst part: Nobody coerced me into graduating in 4 years instead of 5 or 6. Nobody coerced me into trying to save my money and not taking the FE exam. Nobody coerced me into taking classes and labs when all the ASME/ASHRAE/Other meetings were being held. Nobody coerced me into focusing on my studies instead of picking up a job. I have nobody to blame but myself, and I hate it. **I** fucked up my own prospects. I can't even be angry at anyone, and it burns all of my hope, my optimism, my self worth into cinders.

Please, don't get the impression that I feel as if graduates should be handed a job offer as soon as they step off the stage with their diploma. I know the job hunt is its own monumental task. I know that the “economy is bad,” though I absolutely loathe that cop-out of an excuse. I know there are lots of graduates, and a large pool of candidates. I want to *earn* what I get. I know all of this, and I bust my ass for hours each day looking for jobs, and following up on those I can. But, shit, I graduated BSME with honors from a tippy-top-tier engineering school, with relevant extracurricular, with some damn cool design projects, and I get nothing. I see all these posts about how folks are finding their dream jobs. I see each and every one of my friends get their jobs, many with less credentials than me. And every day I have to answer the phone when Grandma calls and tell her “no news” and hear her sigh and lie to me when she says “it will come”. 

So here is my question, reddit: Is anyone else out there like me? Is there some secret to the job hunt that I am missing? The oodles of tenacity I had a year and a half ago is rapidly dwindling. Is there any way to unfuck my prospects? Because right now I feel like I am on the express elevator to the 40-year-old McDonalds cashier.

Hell, just read my rum-bolstered rant and hug me and tell me it will be alright, because I'm honestly not sure it will be.



**EDIT: I posted this last night when I had the blues and went to bed in a huff shortly after. This morning I realize that I came off as whiney, and I was probably  just looking to get stuff off my chest and talk to the anonymous internet dudes.

Some of the responses are nice, some are tough, but all mean well, and I thank you for that. It makes me glad, for a lack of a better term, that I am not the only person in this position, and that others have filled out so many applications and got nothing. It doesn't change my position, I know, but it does offer a modicum of solace. As pointed out below, career searching is a task with no reward until the very end, and it is easy to be disheartened.

Many of the answers are to just keep puting one foot in front of the other, and that is what I've been doing and what I intend to keep doing. I am no stranger to failure, and I know you have to just keep on keepin' on.

So I kind of screwed up this whole ""getting an internship"" thing.  I am currently a sophomore electrical engineering student and I have been looking for a summer internship for a while now.  My problem has been that I have wanted to live at home this summer since I am always away at school and don't see my family too often, so this has limited me to companies that are in driving distance of my house.

Well, that didn't work well as I still haven't landed an internship so I have become more liberal in applying for jobs that are further away.  I recently applied to one last company that is close by and I actually really think I would be a great fit for this job.  Based on the job description that they gave, I think I would love the work that I would be doing.  I also think I am uniquely qualified in some ways, but I also have some shortcoming in other ways (ie. I do not have as much knowledge as they would like, but I am motivated to do whatever it takes to learn the material.)

Ok, I'm kind of ranting but back to the title question.  This company is very small; in fact, they are a startup with less than 5 employees.  I applied to them about a week and a half ago with my resume and a cover letter that I wrote according to standard format, but I tried to express how passionate about the position I was.  So basically my question is, is there a way I can further show them that I am the right person for the position?  I have not heard back from them since I applied, but I was thinking I could maybe write to them again to further express my interest?  I don't know if this is a good idea or a bad idea.  They are a startup so they obviously want an intern that will be able to contribute immediately (even more so than big companies that can kind of train their interns) and I want to show them how motivated I am to be able to contribute to the company.

1357716236.0,27,self.EngineeringStudents,168kqn,[tip] You don't calculate your GPA. Your school does.,36,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/168kqn/tip_you_dont_calculate_your_gpa_your_school_does/,"I see this topic come up a lot in this sub-reddit, and I'd like to address it. 


With little exception, you should never be worrying about figuring out what GPA to put on your resume. You take the GPA from your transcript, and put it on your resume. Done.

Some of you may be wondering ""But I want to list my major GPA, and my school doesn't have that on my transcript!"" You have two options: suck it up, and list your cumulative GPA; or work with your Undergraduate Studies department to calculate that GPA, because they are the ones that know what courses to include. If they don't help you, sucks, you list the GPA that is on your transcript.

This brings me to the one exception: For some odd reason, somebody requires your major GPA with no exception, and your school refuses to help you calculate it. Then you do your best, because you don't have any other option.

Aside from that one exception, you don't calculate your GPA. Your school does it for you. If an employer really cares about your grades, they'll probably request a transcript, so your GPA on your resume better either be one that exists on your transcript, or one that you can say ""I worked with my school to calculate this more relevant figure."" (Even then, it sounds a little weak, doesn't it?) If they care about your grades, the worst thing you can say is, ""I decided which of my courses were most related, and used those."" 

Note that while a lot of companies look for above 3.0/4.0, a lot don't. A lot just want better than a 2.5, some just a 2.0. Many don't care if you have their ""minimum"" if you're ""close enough"" (job wants a 2.75, you have a 2.7). 

If a cut-off is hard, you better meet it hard and straight on with what your transcript says. If the cut-off is more of a guideline, then it doesn't matter if you ""tweak"" anyway.

**tl;dr:** Your school calculates your GPA. If you need absolutely need a GPA for in-major or selective courses, and don't have it, ask for their help. If your GPA matters to an employer, it won't matter what you say your GPA is, it will matter what you school says your GPA is. 

edit: a good second exception from [u/yojfullness](http://reddit.com/u/yojfullness): If your school only provides GPA on a certain scale (say, 5.0), and you need it on a different scale (say, 4.0). Again, you should work with your school to make the conversion, but as with the first exception, if they don't help and you have no choice, you gotta do what you gotta do.",,False,,t5_2sh0b,1357764889.0,,,True,t3_168kqn,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/168kqn/tip_you_dont_calculate_your_gpa_your_school_does/,

I spent hours at the career center, doing my best to build some connections and opportunities for myself.  I think I came across well; three companies asked outright for my resume and a few more suggested I keep in touch about internships.

The terrible thing that I don't want to admit to anyone is that I'm not even sure if I want to be an engineer anymore.  It's been coming on for a long time, this sinking feeling that I don't WANT this, and I am scared.  I am barely handling the academics; I don't know why.  Hand me a textbook and I'll know it inside and out after three weeks, but put me in a classroom and my brain shuts off.  The material is fascinating and I love learning all there is to learn about the physics side, but the prospect of actually working as an engineer fills me with dread.  I thought I would love this career path, and I'm resenting it already.  

I'm struggling with depression and anxiety.  A day of classes leaves me completely unable to handle anything else stressful; you see how this would cause problems.  I hate it, because I KNOW there is NO reason to be so unmotivated and/or anxious about every little thing, but I can barely get out of bed in the morning.  I find myself yearning to just go to the local community college and learn a trade in two years, something practical that I can do with my hands.  

I hate telling my fiance this because he's supported me over the last year financially.  Telling him that it's all a waste would kill me.  That's nearly four grand down the toilet, and more if I register for next semester.  

I can't even imagine telling my parents.  My family paid for this trip to the SWE conference.  My dad put me in touch with his engineer friends.  My mom's best friend's sister is helping me apply for internships.  So many people have helped me achieve something I don't even really want anymore.  

The thing is, I'd love to do something that incorporated some sort of technical skill or knowledge.  I'd enjoy welding, but that has a reputation in my family as something that the ""slower"" kids go get certified to do.  I don't know what my other options are.  

So, I guess what I'm asking is this: is my apathy and dread of engineering normal?  Is this just a hump that I have to get over before I actually start to enjoy engineering?  Or do you think I really need to get out of this program before I waste any more money and time?

J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I am a punctual, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself; I left Villanova because the work was too easy. Once I realized I could achieve a perfect GPA while holding a part-time job at NYU, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, and I want to demonstrate that I am a hard worker. J.P. Morgan is a firm with a reputation that precedes itself and employees who represent only the best and rightest in finance. I know that the employees in this firm will push me to excellence, especially within the Investment Banking division. In fact, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, and I can pick up a new one very quickly. For instance, I learned a years worth of Java from NYU in 27 days on my own; this is how I placed out of two including: Money and Banking, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, excellent with excel, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch, and my research assistant position at NYU. In fact, my most recent employer has found me so useful that he promoted me to a Research Assistant and an official CTED intern. This role is usually reserved for Masters students, but my employer gave the title to me so that he could give me more work.

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited, I just want to outline my usefulness. Egos can be a huge liability, and I try not to have one.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Basically I love the idea of entering contests/competitions or working on engineering-related projects, but they ALL seem to take place during the semester when I have zero time.  

For instance, there was one I saw posters for all over the engineering building where you designed a folding wheelchair with some very nice prize money.  It ended, if I recall correctly, just before Finals.  WTF?  Talk about bad timing. 

I'd love to find similar things *now* during the summer that I could work on.

(3.22) of Sec. 3.7 values of *T* (See Sample 8.3 200 pages back) can be substituted into Eq. (5.32a) and Eq. (7.333b) of section (Alpha Foxtrot 9.7).  This will yield values of J and i, respectively, but in cases of small values of P, which is unlikely, and thus (Fig. 74.234^2 ), where stress concentrations in specific junctions *b* (Example 6.43) exceed the scope of the material in this text.  

In conclusion Eq. (8.1) remains valid, if when Eq. (2.1), for only **P**&gt; T^2z(1-delta), thus X and Ybar, respectively, when theta is sufficiently small, and element is at the neutral surface (Eq. 5.4!), can be given by (I+*j*) x (*i*+**J**)/(C*c).""

Seriously though, do the authors of these text book have no idea how to convey a thought using the English language?  When your sentence explaining 2+2=4 includes like 15 commas, I'm gonna need to to reword it.
