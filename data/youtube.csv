I do not use your service as a social network. I do not care what videos the people to whom I am subscribed like or dislike nor do I care what videos they have commented upon. I do not hold your video recommendations to be as important as videos uploaded by people to whom I am subscribed. Adding two extra clicks to my experience with your site is neither simpler nor more convenient.

I'm planning more updates after I've slept, namely a few more tweaks to how channel names are displayed as well as keeping track of which videos you've watched and marking them as watched on your subscriptions page.

Feedback is more than welcome!

**Edit** [Firefox version available!!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-youtube-subscription/)

**Post Sleep Edit** I'm so pleased everyone seems to like this! :D I hope I can keep making it better. Also thank you for my very first reddit gold!

**Major update** http://i.imgur.com/lDNtSoM.png - this update will mark a video as watched when you either click through from the subs page **or** if you just watch any video on youtube. Your subs page will update live if its open in a new tab or will reflect your current watch history if you visit it later. By default it will simply show watched videos like it does on channel pages, however you can use the toggle in the screenshot to hide watched videos completely if you prefer. **This is a major update** so may include bugs, please let me know!

Chrome updates can take up to a day automatically, but you can force the update by going to your extensions page, ticking ""developer mode"" and clicking ""update extensions now""

They are definitely doing it, but why?

Instead of introducing better H.264 compression, they introduce a 144p option....
That's just ridiculous.
They could keep the same quality of 720p, at the bitrate 360p is currently at, if they would just introduce better H.264 compression (like with x264).

And instead of knocking me down to 144p or 240p, why don't they just knock down the bitrate? Videos slow down because the bitrate is too high, it has nothing to do with the resolution.

One theory: Youtube might be purposely crippling their H.264 compression to make WebM and vp9 quality not seem so far off. When the reality is, x264 compressed H.264 is BETTER quality (slightly) than vp9 (and FAR far better than vp8). And H.265 blows it all out of the water.

If youtube introduced H.265 compression, we could stream 720p video at the current bitrates of 240p, there would be a little bit of mud, but h.265 is seriously THAT MUCH BETTER.

We also can't seek ahead with what is claimed to be seekable, it's all a lie. Constantly I see that the video has buffered ahead, so I click ahead, only to find it instantly DELETES everything I have downloaded previously and starts all over again. The same fucking thing happens when I go backwards on previous viewed parts of a video.
All this initializing and waiting, aint no body got time fo dat, but they think it's okay. AND THEN, it stops buffering when it's buffered about 10 seconds ahead, this is absolutely crazy.

Not only that, if you leave a video paused overnight, YOU CANNOT REPLAY IT THE NEXT DAY. The new initialisation shit makes the token expire so you get the static error message and lose everything you have buffered.

Youtube is a NIGHTMARE for people with poor internet connections, not everyone has fucking google fibre.

I've also noticed I can not click ahead to (for e.g.) 5:00 until 0:01 has loaded. If I click on 5:00, it will play 0:01. Why can't it remember that I want to go to fucking 5:00 and as soon as it loads 0:01 then skip to 5:00?
I end up clicking and clicking and clicking, and this in fact prevents it from ever loading 0:01 because it tries to initialize 5:00, and then switches to 0:01, even though it needs to initialize 0:01 first!! So my video just never loads.

These fixes are very very simple and basic to implement, Google do not hire idiots. Why are they sabotaging themselves when they could make youtube so much better within a couple days of tweaks and codes.

And don't even get me started on the retarded new channel pages which look like a barf of videos everywhere. And no one wants to use full names, no one, except for video channels that only want the subject to be about that specific person, but even then it seems most would feel it's an invasion of privacy, even more so than facebook because at least facebook has privacy settings.

Youtube has progressively been getting worse, and worse, and worse, since the end of 2007. It has never once gotten better, not even for a little while.

And the video ads on top of all this is just the fucking shit sprinkles on top. I couldn't ever consider using youtube again without an ad blocker. If youtube worked CORRECTLY, then maybe.
It would be nice if youtube intialised the first few seconds of the video whilst the ad is playing so the video will play instantly afterwards, but no, that seems to be way too complicated for the idiots.

Did you know youtube has been trying to KILL the ""charts"". Youtube don't want you to see what is universally popular. You can no longer see videos with ""the most comments"" or ""the most likes"". The only thing you can do is see ""the most viewed"" but you can't even get to the page from within youtube! it's crazy! the url is http://www.youtube.com/charts . If you click on the drop down, you see there are no other options, they have been removed, only most viewed.

Does anyone else see this? It's crazy. I really wish we could start a campaign to start insulting the youtube programmers. I want them to feel like shit for creating shit, and then I want them to reveal who is making them do this. Youtube is more than just a video site, it is THE video site of the world, it is an important facility, but they're ruining it. They should be ashamed of themselves.

Download speeds of random videos are abysmal, I pay for 75mb/50mb connection and I get it most of the time, but when it comes to YouTube I can apparently only buffer at 300kb/s if I'm lucky. Video playback constantly stutters and buffing often gets interrupted for seemingly no reason. Hundreds of people with different ISP's scattered around the world are all having the same issues and the only common thread is YouTube. I think it's high time we get Google to take some action! I mean I can't be the only one who thinks this is horrible, YouTube is supposed to be like the Mecca of internet videos but fails to buffer them almost every time. If you have the same issues and feel as I feel than maybe if we get enough people together we can make a statement that we won't put up with it anymore. These are the type of things that need to be fixed, stop wasting time integrating my profile with Google + which I will never use because it's about as desolate as Chernobyl and fix your buffering.

TLDR: Suck a fat one YouTube.

[My response to blocking IP ranges](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/196170/how_to_stop_time_warner_cable_sucking_at_youtube/c8rw4rj)

So both of the quick fixes may have the intended speed increase momentarily, not at all, or ???.  After researching the topic a bit further I found a few things:

- My assumptions of excluding 'c.youtube.com' from DNS were wrong.  There were a few nay-sayers which I asked to provide proof when saying I was wrong earlier. I even asked if they'd like to team to work the problem out. Only one took the offer. Even still, thanks for keeping me honest.

- Mitch Ribar's assumptions are also inaccurate.  Additionally, I've had reports from redditors saying that some Google services were unable to connect from client to server (Google).  Again, why would you exclude IP ranges of a service you could use on a daily basis?


These two links were a godsend and I'd like to thank the authors for there hard work and research.
First link is a PDF and I think this PDF disproves Mitch and I. The second link is the winner.

# [Details the way the cache sites are used and connected.](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~viadhi/resources/youtubehotmd.pdf)
# [Details the way the HTTP parameters are utilized.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.2546/full)


The exclusion of cache servers may or may not increase the overall speed/quality of your Youtube experience.  There are many factors outlined in the first PDF.  For instance, depending on your location excluding certain cache sites may be a bad thing.  The hierarchy for the cache sites is on Table 1.  All of the cache sites have multiple iterations:

- lscache
- tccache
- cache
- rhost (generic)
- rhostisp (generic)

From what I can gather, the first 40 secs of a video is burst to your browser.  Based on several factors (all HTTP parameters) you will be throttled to a certain data rate.  The throttle factor seems to be your best chance of manipulating speed. 

""...YouTube servers apply a data rate limitation of about 1.25 Mbps."" - Analysis and modeling of YouTube traffic

""The presented results have shown that YouTube's progressive download commences by transferring an initial burst of 40 s of data at the Internet's maximum available bandwidth and later applies a throttling algorithm that imposes a data rate equal to 1.25 (i.e. the throttling factor) times the video clip encoding rate.""  - Analysis and modeling of YouTube traffic

Conversely, I think there may be another catch. Different cache sites host the video called and relay data between one another.  If it's a popular video chances are it's on most servers.  The data rate can be limited by the encoding rate which is handled at the servers.  So if you choose (limit) the wrong cache servers you could have a bad/good YouTube experience.

If you were to open the source code you will see these parameters. The excerpt below shows what I mean.

""yt.preload.start(""http://r8---sn-ab5e6nsl.c.youtube.com/generate_204?ipbits=8\u0026fexp=916603%2C912506%2C913810%2C904310%2C916612%2C920704%2C912806%2C902000%2C919512%2C929901%2C913605%2C925006%2C906938%2C931202%2C931401%2C908529%2C930807%2C930803%2C920201%2C930101%2C930603%2C906834\u0026id=6aa09c40e943338a\u0026signature=98451E574DF00A9672C4C9106D16EFFB07B291DC.7589F108EC4A8A046783AE56AD322962059997AC\u0026burst=40\u0026algorithm=throttle-factor\u0026key=yt1\u0026expire=1362835124\u0026newshard=yes\u0026ip=UR.IP.ADR.HERE\u0026upn=udSvm76eos0\u0026cp=U0hVR1hOU19HTkNONV9QSFdCOkFON3Q2cE9SN1ZV\u0026sparams=algorithm%2Cburst%2Ccp%2Cfactor%2Cid%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire\u0026factor=1.25\u0026sver=3\u0026source=youtube\u0026mt=1362811634\u0026mv=m\u0026itag=35\u0026ms=au""

u0026factor=1.25 &lt;--- This is the data rate 

It seems Youtube only limits the data rate via HTTP parameters.  If someone was to manipulate this value on-the-fly by using an extension/add-on then we'd have a winner.

To experiment with the Youtube video you'd like to watch: Select the quality, View source code, Save source, find data rate change &amp; save, now open the local copy. 

If anyone has any recommendations or would like to help with analysis please message me.

Therefore, posting on reddit will have little to no effect on the decisions made by Google. However, what will get their attention is enough people using the feedback tool.

At the bottom of every YouTube page is a help button. Click that then click ""Send feedback"" to send feedback. It will take a picture of the current page and send it to Google with a message that you write. You may highlight important areas or black out personal data in the screenshot before you send it.

If you have the time, please send feedback to Google. Every message sent is a step towards a better YouTube and is greatly appreciated.

For those who are interested, this is what I'm sending:
""This new subscriptions design is far below the expected quality of YouTube.  It should be noted that this new design completely undermines the idea of YouTube. Users should be able to post and watch videos with ease.

The subscriptions page should show videos recently posted by the youtubers that the user is subscribed to. Nothing more. The current subscriptions page should be renamed to ""feed.""

With the old layout, videos were shown in a grid. This allowed around 25-30 videos to be shown on the screen at any given time. When you watched a video, it would be removed from the subscriptions page.

The new layout, on the other hand, shows videos in a feed format. This allows at most 5 videos to be shown at once, reducing the efficiency tremendously. When a video is watched, it is simply tagged as ""watched."" This makes watched videos take up space, which is also inefficient.

Please keep in mind that the descriptions of videos are rarely used in the intended way. They are mainly used to provide additional information about the video that is only useful after the user watches said video (such as links, titles of songs used in the video, etc). Descriptions do not need to be shown on the subscriptions page. Even if they are shown, the amount of text that will fit in the subscriptions area is very small, rendering them useless in the first place.

Please consider reverting back to the old layout, or at least allow existing users to continue using the link ""http://www.youtube.com/my_subscriptions"" to access the traditional subscriptions page.""",,False,self,t5_2qh44,False,,,True,t3_1kglow,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1kglow/please_use_the_feedback_tool_to_contact_google/,

I am getting this front page at work. I am still getting the ""old""(?) front page at home for god knows what reason. But I want to raise the issue with the community, and I figure since Youtube isn't likely to respond to the feedback I sent in, perhaps the Reddit community can help move the mountain. If, of course, people agree with my sentiment.

The new front page is utterly retarded:

- I can't see my subscriptions easely. I see a lot of recommended videos, and comments made by those I subscribe to, but scrolling down the list, it takes forever to spot a new upload, and they are far and wide apart.
- If I click my ""258 subscriptions"" at the top, it takes me to an overview of all of my subscriptions - not their latest uploaded videos. The same happens if I click ""My subscriptions"" to the left.
- The only way I can see the latest video from one of my subscriptions is by clicking on them in the menu to the left - and only if they appear. I can choose who to show in the left menu, but I think this is a very convoluted system. I can also, of course, go to their channel page.
- The ""Recommended"" channels to the right is stupid. I don't want to subscribe to someone just by their name and image, so I'd have to click in to see these recommendations. And if I do that, then there is no need for 15 recommendations.

As a Youtube viewer, this system is annoying. I can't easely see the latest updates from my subscriptions, all of my subscriptions. I can't just browse their latest content as I am used to. Instead of being able to see the content I *want* to see, I have to see content that Youtube think I might like to see.

As a content creator myself, I am absolutely mortified by this. It seems like Youtube is cutting off its own foot. People are driven to Youtube for the people they follow, and if they can't access this information easely, but are instead having random videos forced upon them, then the user does not get what he want, and content creators will find a drop in views.

Am I the only one who has a big issue with this? I hope that I am not, and I hope that we could use a thread like this to rally peoples attention on this.",,False,self,t5_2qh44,False,,,True,t3_ymrez,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/ymrez/youtubes_new_front_page_is_terrible/,

Whenever I try watching a video, it plays for a little bit and then the video suddenly ""ends"" earlier than it's supposed to. Like, if I try watching a video that lasts 2 minutes, it stops at the 1 min, 30 second point and the run time at the bottom says it reached  1:30/1:30 instead of 1:30/2:00.

This has happened to me in multiple browsers. I don't know what to do.

Has this been happening to anyone else? Does anyone have an idea on what's causing this problem and how to solve it?

But even when I go to watch them on the main site they are generally very slow. most will load about 1/8 of the video and stop until I play the video a bit and then the loading bars jumps forwards rapidly and then freezes again. Other times it will play for a bit, have a good amount of load bar filled, then just stop and show a blank screen. I hit play again and it basically refreshes the player (not whole page) and starts over with the slowness.

I thought it may just be the computer I was using at work (we have horrible computers... Windows XP with 2gb RAM), but even when I am at home it does the same exact thing (different, newer computer). Then I can't even use the youtube app on my phone because it just force closes right away (Droid 4, this is why I feel I may just be unlucky).

These are the things I believe need fixing:

1) Center everything.

2) Allow customization of background color. The current white is blinding.

3) Make ""My Subscriptions - Uploads only"" the default homepage.

4) ""Recommended videos"" on the right, not ""Recommended channels"".

5) Quit trying to give YouTube a Facebook/Google+ vibe, it's not going to happen. I don't care who liked/favorited/subscribed to what. And when I click on ""Playlists"", I expect to see my playlists and their content, not a Timeline™ showing when I created my playlists.

6) Add a ""Play All"" and ""Remove all"" buttons immediately accessible to the ""Watch later playlist"".

7) The ""Guide"" on the left is fine, but when it's the only thing on the left, don't collapse it by default.

That's all I can think of at this moment.

What would you change?

The link is basically a channel called ""Most Popular"" made by YouTube that i had no idea existed before this :D
I just really hate how when you're signed in your YouTube account, the ""homepage"" is basically recommended videos and activity from your subscriptions. You have no clue what's going on in the community as you can only look at what your sunscriptions are up to and nothing else.


And i do know opening Youtube in incognito will give you the ""real"" old homepage but you would have to copy paste the video URL into your normal webpage window if you want to comment, like, or add to watch later and favourite.

1368202546.0,11,self.youtube,1e2qc3,Banned Accounts,14,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1e2qc3/banned_accounts/,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to get some thoughts from the YouTube community about banned accounts.

Basically I had a channel with 10 or so videos of me doing a let's play (playing a game). I had only about 300 views. The developers openly announced they support players to make these kinds of videos. I used no copyrighted material in my videos where I did not seek out permission, background music, images, etc and was anal about making sure I had all the right licenses and permissions.

After doing several of those videos I decided to do a new let's play series on the new simcity game (I think this was my mistake). While the EA claims it's ok to do let's plays of simcity, my one and only video of my let's play got flagged for copyright violation of music (the music was only the background music that is played in the game, not some track I put in the video). I've heard stories since my ban of others getting banned because EA goes out and trolls accounts with showing their games.

I go to log in one day and it says my account has been banned for repeat violations of the community guidelines. Here's the useless message incase you've not had seen it before.

We'd like to inform you that due to repeated or severe violations of our Community Guidelines [link] your YouTube account [account name] has been suspended. After review we determined that activity in your account violated our Community Guidelines, which prohibit spam, scams or commercially deceptive content. Please be aware that you are prohibited from accessing, possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts. For more information about account terminations and how our Community Guidelines are enforced, please visit our Help Center at [link].

I've read the guidelines and can not find any of them that were violated. I tried the horrible appeals form which basically just collects your email and there's no way to send them a simple message. Basically they say, if we think you're worthy, we'll contact you.

It infuriates me they don't even show you why you were banned. If YouTube really want's to improve copyright infringement they need to do a better job of educating the masses on when they do something wrong (if they did anything wrong to begin with). I don't think most people go around trying to infringe. All I wanted to do was share my game play with the game's community.

Even thought it said I'm ""banned for life"" I created another account, this time only posting the indie game videos and decided to not do any more EA games. This account was also banned after about 300 video views. Same ban message in my inbox.

Does anyone have any experience with dealing with YouTube's horrible customer service on this issue? How far were you able to get with your appeal and if you managed to get your account back, how did you do it?

TL;DR
YouTube account was banned and no explanation given. Read community guidelines and can not find any that I violated. Looking for anyone who may have found ""the right channels"" on appealing their account for advice.",,False,self,t5_2qh44,False,,,True,t3_1e2qc3,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1e2qc3/banned_accounts/,

If you are having similar problems, hopefully the fix I found will work for you.",13,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v66je/for_a_long_time_my_videos_loaded_very_slowly_and/,"About 7 or 8 months ago I began noticing (especially when watching longer videos) that videos streamed very slowly and did not continue to load if I paused the video. For awhile I thought my internet was just screwing up or my firewall or something was cock blocking, but it didn't seem to make sense because really the only site I was having problems with was YouTube. I didn't really know what to do so I tried to just ignore the inconvenience and try to watch my daily dose as usual. 


**tl;dr** Videos wouldn't load like they used to, very slow, wouldn't load when paused. Had no clue what was wrong.



Recently I discovered what had given me my woes.


One day while watching a video I decided to right click and look and the video info for the download speed. [This is what I saw.](http://i.imgur.com/YmlHu.jpg)


This download speed seemed abnormally low as I expected to see, but considering [how fast my connection should be](http://www.speedtest.net/result/2013236868.png) there was clearly something up.


I switched over to 240p resolution to see how much better the speeds would be, and they were not surprisingly [a lot better](http://i.imgur.com/ilzCg.jpg).


Of course I didn't want to watch any video in 240p so I switched back to 720p to continue viewing.



Somehow, things drastically changed. [My speed had gone up a fuck ton.](http://i.imgur.com/R0Gip.jpg)

I then noticed a big difference between the 720p when I initially loaded the video, and after I switched back from 240p.  The type of player switched from [TagStreamPlayer](http://i.imgur.com/cOuD0.jpg) to [HTTPVideoPlayer](http://i.imgur.com/nr7Rn.jpg).

This was the breakthrough I had. I don't know how, maybe the YouTube overlords changed something, but when I started having problems, videos must have changed to be loaded in TagStreamPlayer by default rather than HTTPVideoPlayer, which I assume is the player YouTube's always had. HTTPVideoPlayer allowed me to load videos at muuuuucchh faster speeds and allowed me to load when paused. 



***So here's what you have to do if you are having the same problems I did:***

**1) Once on video page, change resolution to 240p**

**2) Switch back to 720p**

**3) You should now be on HTTPVideoPlayer, and the problem should be solved**

**NOTE: This is not a permanent fix, so you'll have to do this for every video as far as I can tell**

[Stylesheet](http://pastebin.com/LWgJkUsE): works as is, if you don't want or need to remove videos from the subscription box.

[Greasemonkey script](http://pastebin.com/ybpMkpLU): and use this if you want to.

DISCLAIMER: I cannot guarantee if this script'll work for you or if it'll work later if they change the youtube layout again.

P.S. If you don't know how to install these, please consult your Google.com.

**Edit and P.P.S:** Okay I wrote a short guide how to install scripts: Save the script on your hard drive as [anything you want].user.js. The crucial part of the name is .user.js suffix which is how Greasemonkey detects it is a script to be installed. Then you can install it by going in your browser either to File -&gt; Open File or using shortcut CTRL+O and then finding and opening the file you just saved. Greasemonkey should pop up asking whether you want to install the script.

This is good if you are American but for Europe you can use ""fl"" Which I think is to connect to the Finnish servers. Or ""sp"" Which is for the spanish server. 

This only works if you have a good download speed but get slow buffering on youtube. It won't help if you have bad internet.

As for the new channels, It's hard to comment on them, finding the new videos is nearly impossible and half the time you subscribe, YouTube unsubscribes you silently.


I've even had the rare ""ghost subscription"" where I'd be subscribed to a partner without my notice... It's not exactly the nicest.


But overall, my biggest complaint is that YouTube doesn't ask for a public opinion before shoving it in our face. Would you like to get a barbie doll given to you after your action figure is taken away as a little boy?

It might be a connection problem, but if so I do not know what is wrong. In terms of local solutions, I've done everything from reinstalling flash (full uninstall with deleting folders specified by adobe), disabling pepperflash in google chrome (which is the browser I'm, using) , to reinstalling chrome all together. But after trying it in chrome as well as other browsers, I've come to the conclusion that it is either a problem with my ISP, my router/firewall, or youtube itself. 

To more explicitly describe my problem, some videos seem to load flawlessly. Others don't load at all (light-gray bar not moving), and some load but stop after 30-60 seconds.

The same thing seems to be happening to my laptop, so unless both have some local issue, there is most likely some kind of network issue. 

The funny thing is, this problem seems to exist only with youtube, and nothing else on the internet.

A complete Guide.,15,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/15dwiq/fixing_the_dec_6th_broken_version_of_youtube_a/,"If you use YouTube more than occassionaly you probably noticed on Dec 6th that the entire website fucking broke. Here's the steps to make it at least usable for the time being.

1. **Browse Box** - Restore the browse box above the video so you can see a chronological listing of videos from the same user.
 * http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154471
 * For Chrome users, click Install to download the script, then drag the file to your Extensions page found in the settings.
2. **YouTube Options** - Center the Layout and allow downloads of videos.
 * https://spoi.com/software/yto/
3. **Subs on Homepage** - Set the homepage to show only the uploads from subscribed channels. This also makes the YouTube logo link to this page as well.
 * https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klljlfcipmgohgfdgmliaobikgdoeaah
4. **Rating Preview** - Show a thin bar under the thumbnails for videos to see their ratings. Know ahead of time that something isn't worth your time before even giving them an undeserved view (I'm looking at you ""Reply Girls"")
 * https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-ratings-preview/cgbhdenfmgbagncdmgbholejjpmmiank
5. **Put the browse box above the guide** - This is how to fix conflicts with the annoying new guide sidebar covering up your content.
 * Get the Extension Stylebot: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha
 * Go to Youtube.com, click on the CSS icon in the address bar.
 * Click ""Edit CSS"" then copy/paste this in to the box and hit save:

            #yt-uix-clickcard-card1 { display: none; }
            #moreUserVideos { margin: 0px auto; }
            #showHideButton {
            margin: 5px 0px 5px 200px !important;
            z-index: 999;
            position: relative; }
 * If you want to get rid of the stupid guide sidebar all together (as it's borderline useless), copy this block in to the edited CSS as well.

            #guide-container { display: none; }
6. **Stop this from happening yet again** - And finally send an E-mail to the CEO of YouTube to request he fire the incompetent morons in charge of the latest update that was rolled out before it was finished. There are a lot of intelligent and talented people out there who deserve to have the job of making YouTube better, and they clearly don't.
 * Salar.Kamangar@YouTube.com

Seriously, the page isn't even centered. How do you fuck that up. If you don't believe they should be fired, watch their [30 minute video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV27jxYmN2w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m8s) in which they laugh about how terrible their work is and answer every question with ""Yeah we didn't really know what we were doing so we just removed that feature, you can expect it to come back sometime when we figure out how it worked"". Asshats.

a.	Start every video by saying hello and introducing yourself. If someone accidentally finds you, and it is on your third video, how will they know who 
you are or what you are doing? Start by saying, “Hi everyone! I am _____ and this is my brother _______.” That way everyone is on the same page.

2.	Recap

a.	If you are making a series, talk about what happened in the last episode, in case people forgot.

3.	Script

a.	Remember what you wrote down and decided you were going to talk about.

4.	Close

a.	Encourage people to comment and tell you what they thought, leave a like rating, or subscribe if they want to see more, but don’t tell them to.

b.	Say goodbye! If you can, come up with a catch phrase. Some highlights are “Tarah!” “See you in the next adventure!” and “Let’s end this, with a 
bro-fist.”

V.	Post Production

1.	Tagging

a.	Find where your video was saved on the hard drive, move it to a folder made for your videos, and rename it to something that will help you 
remember what it is.

2.	Planning Your Editing

a.	Go through the video or videos and decide what you want it to be like when it is done. Do you want a bounce sound effect at 4:22? Write it 
down. You want a song to play at 1:44? Write it down.

3.	Editing and Exporting

a.	Drag your video into Windows Movie Maker

b.	Make the edits that you wrote down earlier.

c.	Go to file -&gt; export your video.

d.	Find the video you exported

e.	Move it to the folder you made earlier for videos

VI.	Uploading

1.	Log into your YouTube channel

2.	Click Upload in the upper right hand corner

3.	Drag your video file from its folder to the icon on the YouTube page

4.	Provide a Title

5.	Provide a Description

6.	Provide Tags (5-10)

7.	Select a Category (Comedy)

8.	Add to a Playlist

VII.	Post-Upload

1.	Add annotations if you want them. This includes text on the screen.

2.	Spread the word! If you want someone to see your video, the best way is to show them!
