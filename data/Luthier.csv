He taught me one of the best ways to properly string a guitar so it stays in tune, he taught me to trust my ear and not to lust after gear, he talked me out of more pointless upgrades than I care to admit. He made my Fender Strat (who's sentimental value was immeasurable since it was given to me by my dad in high school) sound absolutely amazing. He was a good man who knew his craft exceptionally well. He made the instrument that I used to make life a bit more bearable work that much better and taught me a lot of what I now know. But what I admired most of all was the passion he brought to his job. He often didn't even charge me for his work, he just loved to work on guitars and chat with friends.

One time, I asked him to replace the tone and volume pots on my Strat from the old cheaper MIM pots to the American standard pots (charged me for the parts but not the labor, just the kind of guy he was). When I left the guitar with him, I forgot to tell him to leave the original knobs on the guitar and not use the new ones because of the sentimental value of the guitar as a whole (I remembered this on my way to pick up my guitar). When I got to his shop, I found he had left the original knobs on without me even telling him to. He understood what the guitar meant to me without me even telling him. It may sound like a small, pointless thing but it meant the world to me that my Strat was that much more original to the one my dad gave me. From then on, no one else was allowed to work on my guitars.

He moved away some years ago and I went to see him once. I always swore I'd go back more often. Next time. Next time. Next time never came and I feel like an asshole. Pardon the rant fellow denizens of this subreddit. I just needed to share with you all the passing of a great guitar-man with great skill and great passion. I'm glad I knew him and the profession he leaves behind is that much worse off without him. He did what he loved and he loved what he did. I'm going to miss him.

I'm going to go check the neck relief on all my guitars now. RIP Eric.

By the middle of my sophomore year (2006, I think) and around $100 later, I had finished it. 

The idea came to me in art class in my second semester. I was looking through a book and saw some designs in paintings that I thought would make some cool guitar bodies. I started thinking it would be possible to rebuild the Squier my dad bought me a few years prior. A little bit of research later, and I had decided I would start from scratch and build my own (I eventually ended up re-using the neck and bridge from my old guitar, since I didn't have the money or experience to build the neck or buy a new bridge.)

I'd say it turned out pretty good considering my complete lack of experience. The sustain is a little on the weak side, but it sounds great other than that.

http://imgur.com/a/qTtDH

(Don't even ask about the red stripe on the back, I have no clue what I was thinking when I did that...)

The body is made of ash (5 pieces glued together.) The jack plate is made of paduak. The pickguard is made of some plastic laminate with Paduak(?) veneer on it. The finish is a few coats of a light color stain and automotive clear coat (I was in a collision repair class at the time, so the finishing materials and equipment were provided by the school. :D)

I re-fretted the squier neck and put brass dots (to replace the mother-of-pearl) on it. I also made a brass nut (probably not the best idea, but it works) to replace the plastic one it had. It has Gotoh tuners, and the electronics are from a pre-made pickguard I bought from Grizzly.com.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_zhajm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/zhajm/my_first_guitar_build/,

[Here's](http://imgur.com/7RRn7) a before picture, and [here's](http://imgur.com/plgzS) after.

**Things you'll need:**
Go out and buy these things. Home depot will have most of the stuff, but not all.

* Your guitar (Like I said... idiot-proof)
* The highest grit sanding sponge you can find 
* Mask, to shield yourself from death
* One can of spray primer
* 1 can of lacquer spray paint for each color you want
* 3 cans of lacquer clear  spray paint
* 3M perfect-it rubbing compound (gotta order this online)
* 3M perfect-it swirl mark remover (online as well)
* 600, 800, 1200, 1500, etc... grit wet sandpaper
* 2"", and optionally fine-line, masking tape
* Exact-o knife
* 2x2 block of wood
* [Screw-on hook thingy](http://photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/6181/8142screw_hook.jpg)

**Things to know:** First and foremost, this will take a long time (like months). It took me a year and a half to paint my baby from start to finish, mostly because of laziness and having to drive to my parents' house to paint. Also **don't mix brands of paint!!!** If you do, expect to see cracks in your finish. Don't paint outside, or somewhere where small particles float around (I made this mistake, and now my guitar has wood shavings embedded in it). Don't spray paint without a mask! And open a window for god sakes! Finally, don't paint while on fire. If you're on fire, you're doing it wrong.

**1. Disassemble your guitar:** Use a screwdriver to disassemble your guitar. Put the pieces in appropriately labeled zip-lock bags and store them somewhere. Make sure to label where each wire is connected. If your guitar's neck detaches, **make a note of how high the bottom of the neck sits off of the body!** For mine, it was 3.99 16ths of an inch. [Example.](http://imgur.com/gJNk1)

**2. Sanding the paint:** The layers of paint on your guitar are like so: paint-&gt;primer-&gt;wood grain finish-&gt;wood. Start sanding your guitar with the sanding sponge (use your mask). Once you see silver, you've hit the primer. Sand the primer off, but no more! If you do it right, your guitar will be smooth like Pootie Tang. If it's rough to the touch, you've sanded past the wood grain finish, and you'll have to paint on some more of your own finish (I didn't have to do this, so you're on your own here.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/Qjz2Q) mine halfway through sanding. Notice the silver primer on the edge of the red paint.

**3. Mask off the neck socket and binding:** So yea, mask off the neck socket and binding. I didn't mask off the binding on mine, but you would use your fine-line masking tape to do this. Make sure you do a good job of masking the neck socket- If paint cakes on anywhere there, you won't be able to reattach your neck exactly as it was before.

**4. Whip out the hook 'n stick:** Take your 2x2 stick and cut it to about arm's length. Screw in the large hook to one end. Screw on the other end to the guitar as if it were the neck. The purpose of this stick is to 1)  hang the guitar while it's drying, and 2) to have something to hold on to while you're painting. You can see how I attached the stick [here.](http://imgur.com/W3Va7)

**5. Modify the wood:** If you're planning on putting in new hardware, I highly recommend drilling any holes you need before you start spraying. I had to file down the holes that the volume and tone pots fed through, but I did it after I finished painting. I ended up peeling off some of the finish doing this, but thankfully the knobs covered up my mistake.

**6. Learn the spraying method:** For the parts that involve spraying, you need to know how to do it the right way. The nozzle should be about a foot away from the guitar at all times. Too close, and you'll get runs - too far away and the paint will dry before it hits your guitar, giving the paint a rough texture. Start spraying away from the guitar, not while you're aiming at it. Make horizontal passes over the guitar, taking about 1 second per pass. Each pass should overlap half of the previous pass. If paint starts running, stop painting, let it dry a little, sand the run down, then keep painting. Spray the sides first, then the back/front. 

**7. Spray the primer:** Using the above spraying technique, spray on the primer. Look on the can to see how many minutes to wait between coats. 

**8. Spray the base coat:** Your base coat should be the lightest color you're using. If this is your only color, skip to step 13. (Note: when you're spraying your colors, don't expect to get a full color on the first coat- Since your spray passes are 1s long, you'll barely be covering the guitar. You won't get the color you want until your 4th or 5th coat. Working slow like this is the best way to avoid runs. I didn't get a single run when I painted my guitar.)

**9. Mask your guitar and slice it:** Using the 2"" masking tape, tape over the entire guitar. Draw whatever design you want with pencil, and with your exact-o knife cut out the sections that should be colored with the 2nd and 3rd color.

**10. Spray the second color:** herp derp. This color should be your next darkest color. If this is your last color, skip to step 12.

**11. Tape up again, spray last color:** Add bits of tape to cover up the sections that should remain the second color. Spray your darkest color.

**12. Peel off the tape:** Now you can peel off all of the tape you put down (except for the tape in the neck socket). When peeling, don't pull up- Instead, pull back. That way you don't run the risk of pulling off any paint. Try not to get any drool on your awesome looking guitar.

**13. Spray ALL the clear paint!:** Herpin derpin. When you're done, your finish should have a neat orange peel texture.

**14. Agonizing Torture:** Now you have to let the guitar sit for 3 months. I know, it sucks, but this is a necessary step. If you rest your guitar on something before the paint is cured, you'll notice that the finish will take on the texture of whatever it's resting on, which is a terrible way to ruin your paint job. I read that Gibson lets their guitars sit for 6 months before they touch them, so you should feel lucky.

**15. Wet Sanding** Start wet sanding using a sanding block and your wet sandpaper. You'll notice that there are obvious bumps between your colors. This is because you caked on so many layers of paint.  Start with lower grits- your goal here is to get rid of the ridges. When you get to the higher grits, the goal is to get as smooth as possible. Your guitar should have a dull finish now. Don't worry about sanding too much- with 3 cans-worth of clear paint, you probably wont hit the colors. IF you start to see color on your sandpaper, though, stop what you're doing, get another can of clear, and go back to step 13.

**16. Buffin':** Whip out the 3M buffing solution and a 100% cotton fabric (I used an old t-shirt). Apply a dab of solution to one section of the guitar and rub it in with the cotton. The harder you rub, the shinier it gets. Work in small sections until the entire guitar is shiny. Then repeat this process with the Swirl Mark remover.

**17. Reassemble and Enjoy:** In case you haven't noticed, your guitar is finished now. Reassemble it and ride off into the sunset with your shiny ax.

I didn't take any pictures while I was spraying on coats of paint, so sorry. :/

**EDIT 1:** So some people were asking how I did my design specifically. When I was at step 9, I drew a single dot on the body and a straight line through the dot. Drew another two lines through the same dot, but angled 60 degrees away from the original line. Then proceeded to draw parallel lines to each of the three lines, spaced uniformly. This created a triangle pattern. If you look at the illusion, each cube is actually a hexagon. 6 Triangles make a hexagon... you see where I'm going with this.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_qy2o9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/qy2o9/cross_post_how_to_give_your_guitar_a_professional/,

  &gt;So, that's my life in the alternative wood fast lane. I hope that you find it useful and not too frightening. All this wood has taught me a lot. I don't believe that unquartered wood is a handicap. I don't think the species of wood contributes to the tone of a guitar. I don't concern myself with with tap tones or tap tuning. I believe that good work and experience is everything. None of this will sway a mind that is already drenched in traditional guitar mythology, but so be it.

From what I can tell this is the guitar at retail:

http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/ibanez-ew20ase-exotic-wood-figured-ash-cutaway-acoustic-electric-guitar

Needless to say I snagged it immediately, I am gonna do my best to repair it, then if I have the willpower and don't fall in love with it too hard I may go and offer it back to them. If the repair fails I may just use the parts, the electronics look nice, but I think the repair will be fine. 

The strings on it are brand spanking new elixirs so my theory is that they may have tried to go a guage too heavy for this neck.

Now, I have never done a repair like this and the exotic wood veneer is going to make touching up the paint to hide the glue lines pretty much impossible. 

I am looking at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc9xZJoZO9g for guidance, thoughts?

Update:
Guitar is now back with the original owners!

OK so the neck gluing seemed to work pretty well. I put the tuners and strings on to check stability, and the guitar tuned up reasonably well, and then I started playing it and wow! I loved it! I knew I needed to return it immediately before I started enjoying it too much. 

So I tried to put it in a case cause its raining out, and that's when I realized it was a jumbo body, like maybe a baritone?  No wonder it sounded so full. I knocked on the door and a woman answered, she kept asking me ""how much"" she didn't understand I was just doing it to be nice, but she thanked me finally and said her husband would be thrilled. I told her just to let me know if she ever decided to throw it away again.

A few more info on the build. It's a neck-through guitar. The neck is ash, and the rest is pine.

It plays like a beehive.

And i've had trouble with it....which made me not take pictures at some steps out of frustration. The painting was a real pain. I've had to repaint some parts up to 5 times, and even then some parts look like crap. Also, I tried putting a wraparound bridge, not checking my measurements and thinking it would it, but it ended up WAY too high...And putting it in made the body crack from the front all the way to the back, all along the glue line between the pine and the ash.

This is my second guitar and it's a headless design I came up with that was inspired by the reverse tuner setup on some Kramer guitars and basses. I made even more mistakes on this guitar than I did the first, several of which cost me massive amounts of time. I learned a lot but the guitar is riddled with mistakes, some of them hidden and some not. That said it actually plays great and it was a gift for a friend who really likes it. Some facts:

- 23"" scale length
- 4 string headless design using a 4 string electric mandolin bridge and locking Grover tuners (pulled off my last guitar) with 3/8"" string to string spacing, strings are pulled through the body and out the backside to the tuners
- Neck has no truss rod, maple with mesquite fretboard with a tung oil finish, 24 frets
- Body made of mahogany and canary, finished with a stain/poly combo for a semi gloss finish that retains the grain pattern
- 1 Dragonfire hot rails pickup, volume knob
- was originally going to be a neck-through made from a tin lunchbox but the material was extremely hard and frustrating to work with so I redesigned it as a bolt-on.
- electronics plates were hand cut and polished from aluminum sheet
- it uses a bolt for a nut (who what what?)
- right now it has the middle 4 strings of the guitar, A D G B

I wanted to make a gift for a friend and I had been jonesing to see if I could make building a guitar easier than last time with what I learned from the first go around. I settled on a simple 4 string design inspired by cigar boxes. Originally the body was going to be a Darth Vader lunch box (he's a Star Wars fan) but I found it to be a difficult and flimsy material to work with and after devising and building a whole hidden tuner design decided to abandon it for a bolt-on with a wood body instead.

In spite of the flaws I learned even more this time around and the result is 10x more playable and superbly balanced thanks to the headless design.

Flaws:

- Spent weeks working on a design for mounting the guitar to a lunchbox which ultimately was completely scrapped
- Had to spend forever filing frets because once again they went in very unlevel (which I now attribute to using a rubber mallet instead of an arbor or deadblow hammer)
- Had to cut the mounting hole tab off one tuner to fit it on the guitar with the others (I measured the holes with another set of tuners that I eventually decided were too cheap to trust)
- Did a quick fix finish for the body (2 coats of stain/poly brushed on), there are a few visible brush marks and some drips on the sides, kinda sloppy even though I still like the overall look.
- Routing the strings through the body and around the backside to the tuning pegs made for a huge increase in tension behind the bridge with my initial design you see in the photos (I had small posts that routed the strings like a tree but later widened the channel and removed them) which made the guitar essentially untunable without breaking strings, so I had to rethink that after the fact
- Although I lined the neck up flush while creating the body pocket, when I actually put the bolts in one side came up a slight bit making it about a millimeter or two higher on the treble side, luckily I could just raise the bridge saddles to compensate but jeez.
- When screwing the bridge on, two of the shitty screws that came with it snapped clean in half midway through screwing them in. I nearly had a heart attack as I had already did the finishing, but after a day with some vice grip pliers and a very small drill bit I was able to extract them both and re-mount with better hardware and hid the mess under the bridge plate.
- The tuners act a bit funny, you'll start to turn the knob and nothing will happen and then suddenly it will kick in, no doubt because there's some extra tension and the string routing is a bit wacky.
- Because I'm an idiot I hand drilled the inlay holes and as such they ended up crooked looking, especially the last few up the neck.

I'm sure there are others but you get the idea. On the other hand:

- It plays well. The action is a little higher than I'd like, probably because the neck is dead straight since I'm using ultralight string gauges on a short scale so if I didn't raise the saddles I would get buzz, but the strings are so easy to fret that it compensates nicely.
- It sounds pretty good! The pickup is good sounding and I learned from my last guitar that they are not arbitrarily placed (the first one has it by the bridge and sounds very nasal) so I picked a sweet spot closer to the neck position. It takes cleans and distortion nicely.
- It is perfectly balanced. One of the biggest lessons I learned with my last guitar is how important balance is to an instrument. I completely ignored that fact with the first and it was nearly unplayable from the neck dive it had from it's tiny body and heavy thick maple neck (not to mention odd shape). That was the main reason I chose a headless design this time around and I don't regret it at all, even though switching to a solid wood body from the lunchbox probably made it less necessary.
- It is comfortable to hold. I got the contours better this time around (no room for any on the last guitar). It's a small instrument as you can see in my last comparison pic, but it feels good to hold and has all the right rounded edges where they count most.

So ultimately, while the aesthetics are rough I am pleased at how much more usable an instrument it is. It's a bit funky and weird as I love adventurous and atypical designs, though interestingly I took a lot of inspiration from traditional instruments while building it.

Tinning is pretty much heating solder over the tip of the iron and then wiping it off onto a damp cloth, rinse and repeat. My iron of course had a huge amount of crap on it, so I even needed to scrape a bit of deposit off it first.

And [this is the rag](http://i.imgur.com/ybgSWLK.jpg) which I was using to wipe off onto. All the brown stains are from the iron, all the crud that had built up!

My first build gone awry...",19,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1gxlx4/so_close_but_still_so_very_very_far_my_first/,"Well it's taken me the better part of 3 months (working periodically in the intense summer heat) to build a Soprano Ukulele for my wife. I labored over each detail, and finally, yesterday, I strung it up and began the final filing and dressing. That was when I discovered it, how I missed this before I'll never know, but my fretting was off ever so slightly, while small at first, this created a cascade effect and very quickly I determined the instrument is complete unplayable. I looked at removing the fretboard and trying again, but I put it on with very cleanly brushed titebond II. As my loving six year old said while I was grunting trying to remove it, ""Dad, you said you put that on there nice and good, there was no way it was coming off."" Sigh. These kids have amazing memories..

So here I sit, I have the wood necessary to start again, and I've certainly learned a lot in the process, but it's hard to get the energy to attack it again. My same loving daughter just walked by and said "" Just think Dad, you'll be able to see if you did it right by October."" Ouch..Thanks kiddo, go brush your teeth!

I'm sure I could try to pull the fret wires and re measure/cut, but at this point I'm really leaning toward chalking this up as a massive learning experience and starting again. More than anything I want that same kiddo to learn the lesson that it's more about getting up than falling down.

Anywho, just wanted to leave this for someone else who might have the same experience. Take a deep breath, remember you learned a lot, and go again.

1361291401.0,16,self.Luthier,18ton9,I am fixing up an old acoustic guitar. Is this the right place for me to be? [x-posted from r/guitar],18,2,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/18ton9/i_am_fixing_up_an_old_acoustic_guitar_is_this_the/,"Hi guys. I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong section. I'm fixing up an old acoustic that someone gave me and I wondered if there was anyone here who would be willing to answer a few questions along the way.

A little bit about the guitar:

It appears to be a classical guitar, and I was told it was from the 60s. The man who gave it to me assumed it was garbage and was a bit of a hoarder, so it sat in his garage for something like 50 years.

The thing is, it's in beautiful condition. The body is really tight, the neck is straight and - once it got cleaned up - the color and finish are really beautiful.

It's a natural finish with (what I assume is) an ebony fretboard. The inside of this guitar is mint, smells great and sounds good. Then again, I am not experienced at all with guitars, but I do know a thing or two about furniture and the wood looks and feels sound.

Why I'm fixing it up:

My current guitar is a roundback Ovation and, being a girl, it doesn't sit right in my lap. Translation: my rack is too big. I feel like the sound quality is kind of garbage and, frankly, it's more of a family heirloom than an instrument.

My hope is that I can get this little guitar fixed and retire the Ovation.

What I need:

**I have to glue the neck.** It's supported by an inaccessible rod, which is the only reason I think this thing has stayed so straight. I am looking for pointers on how to handle this bit. I have tons of clamps.

**I need to replace the machine heads.** I found [these guys](http://www.dhgate.com/2pcs-set-guitar-accessories-gilding-classical/p-ff808081368687a601369b254d593eca.html#s1-6-null) for super cheap, but I don't know if that's what I want. I like the look of the metal but the heads look really cheap. Advice, thoughts, suggestions?

**I am thinking about replacing the nut.** It's probably the original plastic version and I'd prefer bone - is there any real difference or did I get bonked by my last luthier? There's no saddle on this thing. Or maybe it's a metal saddle? The strings terminate into a metal piece [that looks a bit like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Stella_In_Case.jpg/800px-Stella_In_Case.jpg) and I have no idea what it's called. **Edit:** Thanks to u/jooes I now know the metal bit is a called a tailpiece. I apologize for my idiocy!

I can post some photos if you guys want to see what I'm dealing with.

I don't know what else you might like to know but I appreciate any and all feedback, suggestions and tips.

Thanks!

**EDIT** In lieu of photos of my actual guitar, [here is a picture I found on Google](http://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/6324090/il_fullxfull.248623509.jpg) that looks similar to what I've got. You can see the bridge, stock and tailpiece, which are very similar to mine. The body shape is also pretty close, but mine has some fancy line work around the hole and a pick guard. Is this a parlor guitar, not a classical?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could answer me the following questions. It doesn't have to be an essay, but some additional info would be helpful

* Why did you choose this profession?
* What is your favourite part about your job?
* And what is your least favourite?
* What education did you take?
* What other educations could you take from there? what kind of impact would that have on your career
* What part of your (high-school) physics class do you still use in everyday life?

this information will be used to make teaching material to make young students understand better what professions they can practice with a career in physics.

So, I haven't ever been too happy with the pickups on my Jazzmaster.  The problem is that they're dual coil pickups, and no one makes them.  I had to have the first set custom made, and well the guy didn't do such a great job.  

But, since then my wife bought and abandoned an old Viking Husqvarna sewing machine (we couldn't find feet for it) which seemed like it'd make a great pickup winder to me.  I was also looking for a simple project to do in the machine shop.  Nothing I made really had to be done on a lathe or mill, but it's been 7 years or so since I've used a machine and I'm not sure how much longer I'll have a shop at my disposal.  It was time to refresh myself.

Anyway, there was quite a lot of learning that went into the project, but it was a success.  The next step is to build a counter so I know how many winds I put on the bobbin.

Started with an all-parts body ($60 second) and decided to do the coloring with orange kool-aid. For those who are interested:
- 11 packs orange kool-aid
- 1 liter water
- 1/3 cup vinegar

Finished the body with minwax tung oil finish. 

For the neck I decided to try and go with a used squier tele neck. (I may decide to replace this though. 

Pickups are [GFS Fatbody](http://www.guitarfetish.com/Alnico-Fatbody-Oversized-Polepiece-Tele-Bridge-Pickup_p_75.html).

Got the electronics working on the third try (turns out not everyone on the internet agrees where the capacitor should go)

**Here's where I could use some help:**
Once I finished and put the strings on I found that the high e is almost at the egde of the fretboard at the high end. [pic](http://i.imgur.com/YiILS.jpg)

I do intend to take it to a luthier for a proper set up regardless but I wanted to see if it was something I could sort myself as the whole point of doing this project was the learning.

I figured it could be a couple of things:
1) **[the bridge is on a bit crooked](http://i.imgur.com/KpwUZ.jpg)**. This is something I plan to fix soon anyway (I am ordering a different bridge as the one I purchased seems a little too short) but I am wondering if it could be the cause.

2) **The neck could be on a bit crooked**: It took me 3 tries to get the neck to sit straight. I don't see it but it could still be a little off. It could also be because it is a used neck that it has a twist or something I don't see with my untrained eye. If it is a twist I would be fine with just getting a different neck.

Oddly enough, I was able to set the intonation and it plays pretty well aside from the string thing. So I  am pretty happy.

Thanks for any insights!

**update** :It seems the solution was a crooked neck.

Here is the neck [after adjustment](http://i.imgur.com/M2ibs.jpg) and the bridge is [much straighter as well](http://imgur.com/a/kWTQk#30).

 - some CSS changes - suggestions?  (I'm thinking earthy tones, like shades of brown, perhaps with a fretboard either along the top, or along the right hand bar)
 - a new logo (does anyone have any ideas?  I tried some things out a while back, but nothing looked good.  should we have a logo contest?  can anyone do a couple and post them?  just remember that they need to scale down well)
 - content - always.  We're not hurting for it - we get new postings all the time - but more is always better
 - more focus on acoustic instruments - violins, arch tops, etc.  we get a lot of electric guitar posts here, and it would be nice to see more acoustic instruments
 - perhaps creating some strategic partnerships with other relevant subreddits, such as /r/violin, /r/mandolin, or others (I have tried with /r/guitar, /r/bass, and /r/telecaster, and I've made postings there to let people know we exist, but other suggestions would be helpful)

If anyone has any suggestions, thoughts, ideas, this is the forum to air them.

* drill press
* forstner and countersink bits
* A bunch of files/rasps
* various standard hand tools

Was planning on buying a neck, building my templates from some dwgs/pdfs from TDPRI (I'm building a tele). I'd try to buy a piece of wood locally first and if that doesnt work out I'll order one (hopefully avoiding needing access to a jointer).

What tools am I missing? Bandsaw/Jigsaw?

I figure that I will add electronic components closer to the finish of the body but will pick out a bridge etc closer to when I need them (though it'll be a standard tele bridge). I'm comfortable at soldering and wiring and have the tools for that as well. A way to cut out the templates/body is the only major glaring hole I can see in what I have. $250 should be enough (in my head at least) to cover  that (esp off of craigslist), the wood, and maybe the neck and some odds and ends.

1351957374.0,15,self.Luthier,12kf8k,I am '3D Printing' an Electric Guitar,20,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/12kf8k/i_am_3d_printing_an_electric_guitar/,"As the title suggests, I am in the final year of my masters in Mechanical Engineering, and my dissertation is to design and build an electric guitar using an Additive Manufacturing (AM) process called laser sintering (LS). A few people asked for more details, so here you go.

I guess most people know that 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing is, but the basic concept is that instead of traditional manufacture starting with a solid block and cutting away material until the finished product is created, you start with an empty space then deposit material where it is required in the final model. This does mean that the final product has to be created first using a CAD package, but it means that there are virtually no limitations when designing the product. A great example of 3d printing is shown in [this video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArGg3fdqLj4), where a 3D gear cube can be printed *fully assembled and working*! (Ok, so the video shows a cube made in separate parts then assembled after, but it can be done in one step).

The AM technique people associate with 3D printing is done in a way similar to a inkjet printer where a print head moves in a 3d space and slowly builds a model from the base up. This has geometry limitations, and it can only make a solid object, whereas other methods such as laser sintering can 'print' fully moving assemblies. LS basically spreads a super thin (typically 0.1mm / 0.004 inches thick) layer of powder on a surface then uses a laser to melt together the solid parts of the model, and leaves the rest of the layer of powder alone. Then it spreads another layer of powder o top and repeats the lasering process. [Here is a good example of the sintering process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VImKhUD-8hk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=32s)

So, back to the guitars. AM guitars are not brand new, a few have been made before by researchers and individuals, but [Olaf Diegel in New Zealand is making some pretty incredible guitars]( http://www.odd.org.nz/guitars.html) in the same method as I will be.

The guitar body is printed in one piece, with carefully designed pockets  for the electronics and wiring. The section between the neck and the bridge is typically a block of wood, although with careful analysis, this could be printed in plastic and have the right stiffness and tonal qualities. The material used for laser sintering is almost always Nylon12, a white plastic polymer with great qualities for sintering and also for life as a used product. To make it visually more attractive it can be dyed with a simple nylon clothes dye, but this takes a lot of trial and error to get right.

So why would you go to all the hassle of making this when a wooden guitar does the job fine? There are some things that the wooden guitars will always be best for - the AM guitar will have far less sustain, but this could also be seen as an attractive quality by some players. The main advantage is that detailed bespoke designs can be achieved then printed in a very short time frame with a skilled CAD operator. Also you can have some fun with the pickups and electronics. How about pickups that can be moved and repositioned to get different sounds whilst playing? Maybe a removable electronics block to switch from traditional to Jimmy Page wiring in a few seconds? Or have a simple volume/tone/switch replaced by a preamp or other active electronics inside the guitar.

Possibly the idea I am most enthusiastic about is printing the body in other materials. I am using a Nylon12 plastic, but the exact same CAD model could be loaded into another machine to print it in Titanium, Steel or even Silver or Gold! Try doing that with your Swamp Ash Tele!

A bit about me: I wanted to learn how to play guitar a few years ago, so I built a twin humbucker Strat copy from an Ash plank out of a friends wood. I had never really touched an guitar before that so it was a true baptism of fire! Many mistakes but I still came out with an instrument which I love, it sounds great and looks pretty awesome! Last summer, I made a Maple Tele which came out even more beautiful than the first.

So I'll try to answer any questions / feedback on this topic and my dissertation, and I hope this will be of interest to a few of you!",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_12kf8k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/12kf8k/i_am_3d_printing_an_electric_guitar/,

A while back, I got it in my head that I needed a new guitar - because I didn't own an acoustic electric, and I decided it was time.  I looked around online and found one that I liked based mostly on good reviews and visual flare (it is a gorgeous guitar, there's no denying that).  I managed to play one at my local GC for about 5 minutes, and didn't really have any complaints with it, so I mentioned to my wife that it was a model I was thinking of buying.

My wife ended up getting me one for my birthday, much to my surprise.  It's an Ibanez EW series zebrawood.  And it is beautiful.  I love the tone, the electronics are sound, everything about it is great.  Until you pick it up to play it.

Now, I'm mostly an electric player, and I'm a little spoiled because my Fender Jag is extremely easy to play.  However, I also have an older Fender dreadnought that is what I consider to be a little more in line with what an acoustic should feel like in terms of playability.  It's not the greatest guitar in the world, but when you finger a chord correctly, it sounds the notes (with a little fret buzz here and there).

The Ibanez is an absolute bear to play.  I have to *really* clamp down on the strings to get them to sound, particularly in the lower frets.  Playing simple open chord stuff leaves my hand painfully cramped after just a few minutes of playing.  I will admit to not being the best guitar player in the world, but even so, this thing is kind of a bitch to play.  It sucks because if it played anything like my Fender acoustic, it would easily be my favorite guitar.

I decided to play it a while before I took it in to get it set up for the first time (about the life of the set of strings on it now, which are starting to show some wear), so I'm here asking what my options are when I do.  I've never had an acoustic professionally set up before, so whereas my electric has an adjustable bridge, the Ibanez does not.  I'm not expert, but I feel like maybe the frets on this thing are not high enough, which is what makes it hard to finger a note.  Right now, I have Elixir strings in an .11 gauge, and the action feels very stiff.   What should I ask to have done in order to make the guitar easier to play?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_zz123,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/zz123/difficult_guitar_what_are_my_options/,

Tenor uke, koa for sides and back, spruce for the top, mahogany for the neck, and bloodwood for the headstock veneer, bridge, and fingerboard. Two piece back with a very thin strip of some contrasting wood on the back, the same with the neck. With kasha bracing, an obvious offset soundhole. Other minor details to be worked out, but we have been discussing this for several weeks, and decided this morning to start cutting and bending this week. We are planning on being careful with the Koa, as it is expensive, but he has some that we can experiment with.
If there is interest, I will post pictures as the build goes on. The idea is I do the build under his tutelage. Goals are best sound possible, then ease of playing, finally it should look good.

I'm kind of sad to see it go, but I am thinking it could be cool to build an electric guitar out of it. So, here are my questions:

1) I believe [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_negundo) is the kind of tree it is. Would this be suitable for anything? It's described on the wikipedia page as a ""weak wood,"" which is making me think no, but I don't really know.

2) [Here is a link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg#Climate) to the climate section of my city on Wikipedia. I read online that if you're going to let it dry in a non controlled place like a garage to expect six months or more to properly dry. Realistically, it will be next summer that I would want to start working on it because I don't have an indoor workshop. My city usually has bitterly cold winters that are pretty dry. Should that be long enough, or should I expect longer?

3) What should I look for in the wood as good pieces? I have a professional coming in to cut down the tree, I'm not doing it myself. Is there any way I should ask him to try to cut it or look out for as he's cutting to make sure I get something usable?

I think that should be all for now. I know it's kind of a crap shoot so I'm not getting my hopes up, but I think it would be killer if I could do something with this tree.

When I looked in the case it was a Les Paul style, but had been refinished (poorly) in a terrible electric blue stain.  The stain was so thick on the back of the headstock I couldn't identify if there was a serial number, and I knew the pickups weren't Gibson, but the tuning heads were and seemed to have original holes.  I knew the finish wasn't factory because it was uneven, a horrible color, and there was all sorts of sawdust and grit in the clear coat.  The electronics had all been torn apart, and someone resoldered them poorly, leaving drips of solder all over the body cavity- so I obviously had tried to DIY something they didn't have a clue about.  Once I stripped a bunch of clear coat and stain off the headstock, I identified a serial number matched to a '90 or '91 Les Paul Studio... WHICH IS AWESOME.  I have spent a little time over the last couple months stripping and sanding the finish off, which is very thick in some of the curves and on the headstock.  The only real issue is that I have sanded a lot on the maple top, and as it's a Studio model the top is 1/2"" in the center and less than 1/8"" at the edges.  I am still having a really hard time sanding enough in the carved portions of the top to get the blue stain out of all of the little grain pores, and I feel like I will change the shape of the guitar top if I sand much more.  I originally wanted to do a French polish, but the top maple panels aren't bookmatched and it would just look okay.  Now I'm thinking of going a very different route, I would like to do some woodburning on the maple top (in a Dia de los Muertos theme) and I think finish in Tru-oil and do a stamped leather pickguard and headstock cover.  This will be my best playing guitar to date once I get it all finished.  Am I being crazy with the woodburning idea?  Is there a trick to get the blue finish out of the deeper pores on the maple side, because not being able to do that has changed my whole approach?",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_1h4ec3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1h4ec3/need_some_opinions_on_a_90_les_paul_standard_i/,

It was my first (to date, only) guitar build, and my only woodworking project. Someone in another thread expressed an interest in seeing it, so I wrote this up as a comment, then decided if he was interested, maybe other people would be too. If you've never built a guitar before - LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES!

When I was building it, I referred to Melvyn Hiscock's Build Your Own Electric Guitar, and a couple of other books on the topic that I found at the library.

I had a bit of help from my family with shaping the body, but a significant portion of it is just me.

Whole thing:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#pQE20

Body closeup:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#GOyS3

Yes, that's aluminum foil all over the pickguard. I'd made a bunch of pickguards out of Arborite (similar to formica, but not a good choice for a pickguard) since I had trouble finding suitable plastic locally. The pickguard cracked, and I really wasn't interested in trying to make a new one and screwing up the holes for the pickups again (This is where forms are *really* important), so I duct-taped it together and used white glue to attach the aluminum foil. I was going for an ironic elementary school arts and crafts look, I suppose. 

Here's the headstock:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#N30a6

The neck was off of a Peavy EXP that a music store sold me - not sure what happened to the rest of the instrument. The holes for the tuners were too big for the tuners I'd already bought, so I bought the appropriate sized ""converter"" ferrules from Stewmac and stuck them in. They were a bit loose, so I used a bit of superglue to hold them down - mistake, that's the cause of the white stuff around the tuners - the vapour from the glue reacted with the plastic.

Close-up on the neck:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#RGAol

The neck pocket was hard - I should have made a form, then routed it before I cut out the body, not after. You can see the shim (Arborite again, I had a lot of the stuff on hand) so that the neck fits in place properly.

Other side of the neck:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#HaYu9

You can see how the body doesn't quite fit the neck.

Back of the body:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#Fw9Pa

You know, I'm actually pretty proud of how shiny I got the finish. Remember, when you're polishing the finish, put it on something soft so you don't gouge the other side (you can see what I'm talking about, I'm sure). I lost the cover I made (Arborite!) for the wiring cavity a while ago, and since I don't actually play this guitar I haven't felt like replacing it. 
If I were doing this again, I'd get a proper metal plate for the neck, or maybe some ferrules for the bolts (actually wood screws).

Close-up of the string ferrules:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#Ogu5x

People, this is why you make forms out of plywood instead of drilling right into the body. And if it's a string-through design, make sure you actually understand where to put the bridge - I didn't, had to move the bridge a bunch of times, and now it's an ordeal to change the strings

Blurry close-up of the electronics cavity:
http://imgur.com/a/wEQNI#Br9A5

The pickups are Burns Tri-Sonic replicas - clones of the ones Brian May used on his homebuilt guitar. I was a huge Queen fan when I built this, and he was a big inspiration to me. The wiring is the same as in his guitar too - three on-off switches, one for each pickup, and three phase switches. It's a brilliant wiring combination and it gives you such a wide variety of sounds - I don't know why it's not in more guitars.

I carved the top of the guitar, and am in the process of sanding it down to remove blemishes and get it nice and contoured (the lines you see are from routing the steps when I was carving the top).


I have noticed that as I am sanding, the grains of the wood seem to be creating some large hills and valleys along the grain lines...It's pretty noticeable when you rub your hands against it.


[Here are two images describing what I am talking about.](http://imgur.com/a/csWFW)
The circled area shows where the valley is created along the grain line...


What did I do wrong, and whats the best way to fix it? Is the sander I was using? If it makes a diference, I was using a palm sander [(this one here)](http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-D26441-Sheet-Sander-Cloth/dp/B0009WRKUC/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hi_1) as well a regular sanding block.

I'm a full-time engineer who is interested in becoming a part-time luthier. I've been playing guitar for over 10 years, and want to join my passion of that with my passion for working with my hands.

I've noticed most posts around here are about electric guitars, but my main interest is with acoustic instruments. I have a few questions for those of you who build them:

First, let's talk tools. I know this gets beat to death, but I have a few specific questions. 

Is it worth investing in a large drum sander to ensure uniform thickness of the back, sides, and sound-board? Or can small power/hand tools do a sufficient job?

And, is a table saw necessary, or could I get by with just a band saw?

Next, I just have a general question about finishing the guitar. Moisture can greatly change the shape of a guitar, and can often cause problems. So, why isn't the inside coated in something as well? 

Wouldn't this prevent too much moisture getting into the wood? I have a feeling it might change the sound of the guitar, but I'm not sure what the outcome would actually be.

Finally, a question that's probably been asked a few times: How much money is a good amount to get started with tools/supplies? From my math it looks like about $1500 on the *cheap* side for tools, but I'm sure I'm missing a dozen things.

Bonus round: Should I purchase a bending pipe or go the DIY route?

Thanks in advance for all your answers!",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_10g5m6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/10g5m6/a_few_questions_for_acoustic_luthiers/,

1346618258.0,10,self.Luthier,z8uaq,Questions on getting a glass-like finish with tru-oil.,12,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/z8uaq/questions_on_getting_a_glasslike_finish_with/,"This is a follow up to[ a post I made earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/xhbp1/a_question_about_drilling_holes_in_an_unfinished/), re drilling before or after finishing.   I've drilled all the mounting holes for the pick guard, control plate, jack, straps, etc, and I'm into the final stages of finishing.

Some background:

I'm using a clean, old pillowcase as my rag to apply the finish.

After I got the pores filled and a good base of tru-oil,
I've done light, wet sands with a sanding block with 1000 grit to knock off any imperfections or streaks. Then I put another light coat with long strokes but I still have streaks, dust and other minor imperfections.

The [guide](http://www.thegearpage.net/board/showthread.php?t=711780) I've been using suggests that you keep alternating with increasing the grit and light coats until you are at 2000 grit.  At that point you're supposed to finish it off with a final coat of 50/50 tru-oil and mineral spirits.  (note: it's the post made by ""Quarter"" with the pics of the lap-steel).  If I still get streaks, dust and imperfections when I apply the oil even when I've done the light 1000 sanding, why I am to think that it will get better when I move up to the higher grits?

So, my question is: am I doing it right?  Anyone got any tips on getting a good, high gloss finish with tru-oil?

I have some very fine sand paper (graduated grades from 300 to 10,000) that I keep wondering if I should use somewhere in this process.  Is the oil too soft a finish for high level sanding followed by buffing with a cloth and perhaps some fine grade, automotive polishing compound?

I'd appreciate any input or suggestions that anyone might have to make. 

Edit:  [Here are some pics.](http://imgur.com/a/ZQ1wa#0).  This is after sanding to 1000 and then trying to put an even coat on it.  You can see the rag/streak marks and dust mostly on the back.  Upon looking more closely at the top and back, it appears as though the pores are not quite filled.  Maybe I'm just too fussy?

Six years and no bonus later, I said hell with it, I'll just make a cigar box guitar. The tobacco shop I planned on stopping at was closed, so I went straight to Lowes to pick up a board for the neck. The more I looked, the more my brain became uninterested in a cigarbox guitar and more interested in making my own.

With nothing more than a dremel, a coping saw, and half a dozen poplar boards from Lowes I decided, hell with it, I'm gonna do it.

Fast forward to now; I've made great progress, but I think I fracked up with how I was planning on doing the headstock. The plan was to glue it on at a ~22 degree angle, but that was before I found out that I was looking at ~200lbs of pressure from the strings; now that I have it on, I fear the titebond III won't hold it.

Here's some shots of the joint; so tell me, how bad did I do? Is this salvageable?

I'm not a huge fan of paisley, however, they really caught my eye and got me thinking. I decided I want something different. I have guitars with quilt tops, flame tops, dyes and the like. I'm craving something different, but not paisley. 



I want to go with Acanthus leaf pattern wallpaper. I've always been in love with this type of pattern, and with what I have in mind, it should come out glorious. The base guitar will be an Epi LP Studio, that's been through hell, and an ill attempted 'Natural back and sides' finish. It's been gouged to hell and back, so some filling is in order. My main question is, **where do I start?** Obviously I want to have a smooth body to apply the paper too. Do I used wood filler for the gouges? Bondo? What about primer?



The finish I'm going for is essentially going to look like an alpine white LP, with gold hardware, and [this pattern](http://www.americanblinds.com/wallpaper/productid,65752) bursted in the front,back, and headstock. Also, how would I go about shrinking this pattern to get more of the ''leafing'' on the the small shape of a guitar.

I've done some repairing and assembling (and all the necessary modifications thereof) but I'm starting my first *build* and I'm super excited. 

As with most firsts, I'd like to start simple, so I'm building a Tele body and I'm re-fretting an old Squier strat neck with a few dead spots. I ordered the fretting kit from StewMac so we're really just waiting on that to get going.


And now the fun part:

* Teles are meant to be made with jigs. I'm inclined to buy one but I think I'd be better served if I looked at specs and existing Teles and winged it, making my template as I go through this first build. Cheaper (until I fuck up) but more importantly I think this would be good experience for me. 

If I do this, should I use MDF, Plexi, plywood, that cutting board material? What's cheapest, easiest, etc. 

* Where can I find plans for a telecaster without buying them? They don't need to be specifically '59 RI or something of that nature, a tele is a tele and if it isn't perfect, great! It's mine. I just want my bridge, rout, pickup location etc to be good. 

* This one is of a slightly different nature, but I think I'm gonna put a humbucker in it (sacrilege maybe) but I already have a set of GFS crunchy rails and I'd like to save money where I can. Has anybody split these before? Do they sound like good single coils or will it just be poopoo? I was considering using just the neck pup but putting it int he bridge position and including a series/parallel mini toggle. thoughts?

Thanks guys! If all goes well I should be able to update y'all with progress pics beginning kinda soon :D


EDIT:  

* Also I've had good luck with GFS pups in the past, you think it'd be worth it to just nab a set of tele pups and run with it?

Due to the ""theme"" of my guitar, and of the decorative pieces on it, i'm more or less forced to put my 3 way switch either on the side opposite of the knobs, so i'd have to wire it between the pickups, or sticking off the side.

So my question is, if I wire it between my pickups, will they affect the sound by causing electrical interference with my wiring? Am I better off putting the switch in an harder to reach place, where its wires won't have to go between pickups?

I'm considering a Les Paul build with a few different takes to ease the construction and change up the feel of the guitar. I'm kind of a sucker for trying new things and I also don't have much in the way of a proper woodworking space or a ton of specialized tools to work with so I'm thinking about making my Les Paul with the following differences:

* Flat-top - No carving in the top exept for...
* Body contours - Pretty much the same as on a strat (Tummy-cut and arm contour) but I'll need to figure out the best placement for the tummy-cut later.
* Straight neck, no angle from the body. This should be possible with:
* String-thru tail with a recessed tune-o-matic bridge much like some of [Godin's Signature series](http://www.godinguitars.com/godinlgxsap.htm) guitars
* Possibly maintain the angled headstock or go with a straight head if possible but that's one thing I need some feedback on.
* Deeper cutaway for better access to the higher frets and a slightly different look. I don't like the [ESP Eclipse](http://www.espguitars.com/guitars/esp-standard/eclipse2.html) cutaway so it would be more rounded like on a [regular LP](http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-Custom/50th-Anniversary-1959-Les-Paul-Standard.aspx), just slightly deeper.

And that's about it.

The body is solid mahogany, possibly with a maple top but with no carving. Any thoughts on a purely mahogany body, with contours? I've heard bad things about a purely mahogany LP body but changing the shape slightly might affect the tone and feel somewhat. It would of course be thinner than a normal LP but not by too much. 

The neck would be a set-neck with mahogany and a rosewood fretboard.

I need thoughts on the neck, since I want it to be straight out from the body and not at an angle like a normal LP. Anything that one would need to think about except the bridge height?

I have no idea if the straight headstock on the guitar is possible. I see some woodworking issues if I need to have an angle on the headstock since I don't have much mahogany to work with and no experience in making an angled headstock. If it's necessary to have one I can work with what I have but I'd like to see how it would turn out with a straight one if it would be logistically possible without destroying the stability of intonation or the strength of the head itself.

The guitars should have the same physical demensions, and they are producing the same note, so you would assume that the tension on the string/your fingers would be the same.

It had a black single ply aftermarket pickguard installed also.  I didn't notice the problem until I had gotten it home.  Everytime my fingers would brush against the pickguard it would charge with static electricity and I would get this awful crackling.  It sounded horrible.

I breathed on it to fog up the pickguard and it would go away for about 20 minutes.  I read about other fixes like rubbing an anti-static dryer sheet against it.

What I decided to do was remove the pickguard and scuff the back of it with some coarse sandpaper.  I then cut a 3.5"" x 1"" strip of aluminum foil and just placed it over the cavity where the neck pickup wires run, up to and under the control cover.  I screwed the control cover screw right though the aluminum foil and simply put the pickguard back on.  I didn't glue the foil or anything.  I just sandwiched it there.

I've been playing the guitar for over an hour and there is no crackling!!!  It is as quiet as a church mouse.  Even if I rub it repeatedly I cannot produce a static charge.

Hopefully this fix has provided a permanent fix.  I've been told that tele's are just noisy and that they all do that.  I found that answer unacceptable.

Hopefully this can help someone else who might have this problem.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_l21ok,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/l21ok/fixed_static_problems_on_my_american_telecaster/,

I don't have pictures of the beginning, but I have begun cataloging the experience. I'm also a complete novice at this. The gentleman I work with figured the best way for me to learn the ins and outs of acoustic guitars was for me to build one. While I'm pretty handy at general repairs, I never even took wood shop in high school, so this is all very new to me.

After shaping the braces to a template on the edge sander and the belt sander, I glued them on and began [shaping](http://i.imgur.com/lLGDZ.jpg). I don't know why, but I've always found working with a finger plane shaping braces to be very relaxing. [Slowly](http://i.imgur.com/1b7lg.jpg) but [surely](http://i.imgur.com/XgOxm.jpg) they start to take shape, until my hand is numb and they're [ready to go](http://i.imgur.com/Qdk0w.jpg). Now I just [glue on the center seam support](http://i.imgur.com/LpHGr.jpg) and it's ready to be glued to the sides.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/7jzCz.jpg) is the back being glued to the sides. This is the second attempt at gluing on the back. The first go around, I didn't have that bottom piece of MDF to keep one side flat, so when the back was glued on, it turned out flat despite the rake that had been planed into the sides and kerfing. Clamped to the bottom board, the back will curve to fit the rake. Unfortunately, [this](http://i.imgur.com/4DS56.jpg) happened. The center seam support fit fine on a dry run, but after applying the glue and clamping, the end got caught up on the neck block and was glued firmly to it, with a nice gap in between the back and the neck block. Bummer :(

After [removing](http://i.imgur.com/er14m.jpg) the top bit of the center seam support and bending a flush-cut saw to try to remove the dried glue between the neck block and the back, we decided that we'd just shove a bit of veneer in the gap and glue it. Neck time I'll apply the glue and fit it, then clamp it down. Lesson learned!

In any case, after screwing up *another* back, I decided to set the blasted thing aside for a bit and work on the [top](http://i.imgur.com/rxnRk.jpg). After joining it with a long, flat metal bar with some sandpaper stuck to it, I glued it up and clamped it down. My last top split up the middle while gluing the braces, so this is top #2. After joining, it was time to get it down to 3/32"" so I headed over to the [thicknessing sander](http://i.imgur.com/D80Wh.jpg). I've gotten pretty handy with this thing, at least as far as estimating how much it'll take off in a pass, and I nailed it at .0935"" (probably the first time I've gotten it just right).

Next it was time to [shape the braces](http://i.imgur.com/vMXiF.jpg), though we'll cut the sound hole before gluing 'em down. After trimming them to fit inside the kerfing, I took them to the edge sander to get a 28"" radius, again based on a template. I had to move out of my apartment, so I've been busy the last few days, but hopefully I'll be able to make it to the shop again before too long.

I don't really have time right now, as life's insane, but things will calm down in a little bit.

Well, it took time getting through customs, but it finally got here.  I unboxed it and checked it out, but the fingerboard had a weird stain on it.  I tried getting it off, but it was pretty deep.  I contacted them, and the next day Larry from their customer service offered to send a new fingerboard out to me, along with a shipping label so they could get the old one back - until he realized I'm Canadian.  At that point, he told me to keep the original fingerboard, and that they'd simply ship me a new one.

I'm building a guitar and I'm looking at the possibility of using a crossfader instead of a 3 way toggle. All one side is one pup, the other side the other and in between is anywhere in between.

I found a 500k slide potentiometer and the lug diagram looks a little like this:

http://www.spiratronics.com/images/techim/Slide%20Potentiometer%20Pin%20Out.jpg

Now I'm presuming that the hot wire from one pup goes to pin 1, the other goes to pin 3 and pin 2 is ground? But then I'm not sure if lug 2 will cut the signal halfway through the travel...

I'm using a 2 vol, 1 tone setup and I found this diagram:

http://www.guitarelectronics.com/media/img/guitarelectronics/W650-H550-Bffffff/W/wd2hh3t21_00.jpg

If I took that and swapped the switch for the slider it looks like the neck vol would go to pin 1, the tone to pin 2 and the neck vol to pin 3. But then is the ground the knob?

I've never seen this done before, but I've read things about it forums. The forum posts all peter out and die off with no results posted. 

The part is easy to get, but the wiring is something I'm having a hard time figuring out in my head and I don't have the part in front of me.

It has a one piece chambered mahogany body, 3 piece mahogany/maple/mahogany neck, macassar ebony fretboard with cocobolo binding and a curly koa headstock overlay. It's only supposed to be a Les Paul in the general body style, I'm not going for any sort of exact replica here.

For the top, I was originally going to do a non bookmatched flame maple archtop but then I came across a piece of flame walnut that looked too good to not use. It's flat sawn though, which means it didn't bookmatch 100% perfectly and it's a little too narrow so there will be a stripe of maple down the middle of the body. The original piece was also only .75"" thick which means I was able to resaw it into two .25"" pieces, which forced me to switch over to flat top. The headstock and body will both have .125"" deep 4 ply cocobolo binding. Because I don't have adequate steam bending skills, I made the bottom cutaway point sharp and I'm going to cut the binding and miter it there. Also, it'll have a Hipshot Babygrand bridge instead of a TOM because the Hipshot bridges look way better in my opinion and only require 2 holes to be drilled instead of 4.

The neck mahogany is reclaimed from a 90 year old bed frame, and that little hole is where a screw once was. I'm going to fill it later but even now it isn't really noticeable. Other than some fine shaping the neck is completely done.

I chambered the body shortly after I got my first router, so the sides are a bit rough. Because I'm making this guitar for myself though, I honestly don't care as long as it doesn't affect the sound.

Has anyone tried the new EMG Metal Works pickups? They look cool but I'm not sure if they sound as good as the regular 81 and 85 or are worth the extra $40 for the set. If it matters, this will be set up for C standard tuning and primarily used for doom/stoner metal.

I was leaning towards doing the tru-oil ""build up/grain fill/buff"" method I've used before on a table but I want to make sure I do what a pretty sweet looking body deserves.

Does the Tru-Oil grain fill method work with multiple shades of wood?  What's the finish you recommend to first-timers to balance quality vs. foolproof-ness?  What have you used on your guitars?  Any and all wisdom is appreciated.

It is/was a Retro H semi hollow flat top with a bolt on neck. I was going to keep it for my daughters but decided they can get their own fun like i did. 

I liked the looks and it has Duncan Designed Mini Hums.. but...  the neck was shorter scale and just a tad thinner than I could use.  

I decided to buy a baritone neck from Kunkle on eBay. transaction was flawless, the neck is finished well and I put it together. 

before pic: http://i.imgur.com/RPyF0.jpg

I had to dump the compensated wrap around bridge because it was just a hair off with intonation.  instead I just used a spare Tone Pros stop tail and wrapped over that.  Eureka!  

the neck is thick as a brick but that's ok.  I put some D'Addario EJ22 with a wound 3rd on it and tuned it down to B. 

man it sounds great!  Either through the Classic 30 or the little Hartke practice amp I have.

I no longer have that privilege, and this has sat for the last year or so.

http://imgur.com/a/1uvIZ

It was going to be a 5 string, neck-thru. I had never made one before, so I kinda just winged it as I went. Body is three-piece, cherry/pine/mahogany(could also be walnut). Neck is maple/mahogany/maple/mahogany/maple.

The cuts aren't perfect and as such, some things will end up being not too aesthetically perfect, but I don't think I fucked anything up too much that it cannot be completed and usable, as long as someone who knows what they're doing takes the project on.

I'd hate to see this never become anything, and because of that I'm giving it away - all you need to do is pay for shipping. Shit, I'll even split the shipping costs!

As you can see, there's much to be done; fingerboard needs to be made, neck shaped, hardware selected and routed for, controls routed, truss rod put in, head shaped and drilled for tuning pegs. You can also see that there are a few things I mucked up; the truss rod channel being the biggest one. I don't think it would affect it too much, and a piece of wood could easily be glued in to fill the router slip.

While it was in my closet, some firearm cleaning solution spilled and dripped off the shelf onto the bass. It's extremely noticeable but to be honest, I think it makes the wood look good! No idea on the chemical effects on it, but aside from smelling like gun cleaner, I don't see how it would affect it much.

If anyone is interested, please let me know. It weighs in around 7lbs and would be shipping from Plymouth, MA zip code 02360. I would really love to see this get finished and I know that I will not be in a place to have access to the necessary equipment for a long time. I really want to see what this can become in the right hands!

If any photos are wanted of specific places, or any questions, please let me know.

EDIT: Also, I would not mind having this back as a finished bass.. If anyone wants to complete the work, let me know your price!

My first kit came last week - [the poplar telecaster from guitarfetish.com](http://www.guitarfetish.com/High-Quality-Solid-Poplar-Telecaster-Style-Kit-complete_p_1196.html)

It's pretty much there already, and good to go.  For a low-cost kit, it seems pretty decent.  I actually got a maple fretboard, instead of the rosewood - I know most people would love that, but I kind of wish I had the rosewood...  I had an idea in my head of how it would look, and now it's going to look different...

Before I talk too much, a little about me - never built a guitar before, not touched major power tools for the past 20 years.  Took up guitar last year, and decided I wanted to do more than just do music, but be able to build guitars as well.  I have a dream I'll be able to become a real luthier at some point, but that seems more fantasy than anything.

My plan for this kit is, built it mostly stock, but with a couple of interesting features, and start adding to it immediately.  Version 1 will be almost completely stock, except that a push-pull pot will swap out the neck pickup with a piezo I will mount under the bridge.

Finish will be bright red, with a victorianox-esque logo - because it's my first guitar, and I'm kind of macgyvering it together, it shall be named the macgyvercaster.  I ordered a product called ColorFX, but the post office is holding it ransom.  It's been over a week, and it hasn't left the post office in Saskatoon yet.  It might as well be on the moon.  :(

First upgrade will be to replace the pickups - both of them.  Bridge will be a GFS pro-series 63 neck pickup, bridge will be their mini-humbucker that fits in place of the single coil, again, hooked up to a push-pull pot.  It will be split in the normal position, and pulling the pot up will change it to humbucker mode - this way, by default, it will play like a normal tele, but pulling the pots will put it into weirdo mode.

Next upgrades will be locking tuners, new nut, and eventually a string-thru-body bridge (though I don't have the drill-press necessary for that one yet), though those are in no particular order.

The plan is built it as stock (ish), and change it later, so as to give me more experience with building, tearing down, and rebuilding guitars.  This is really an experimental piece for me.

Other ideas, possible features, or encouragement are much appreciated.

EDIT:  Right, what have I done so far - the whole point of the post.  So far, I've cut the head-stock to something cool - not standard tele at all, more like a spearhead.  I've shaved down the neck, too - it was REALLY beefy when I first got it, now it's just a little thicker than my LP.  I'm planning on shaving it down a bit more before I'm done with it, but it's pretty good.  Will post pics when I get a chance.

My thoughts are this:  I suspect that if I plug the original pin holes and drill for new ones I could see the top warping badly once I string it up or worse the bridge failing.  If I install a tailpiece I could see the top possibly caving in behind the bridge.  So now I'm looking at finding a cheap test guitar and rebracing the top to withstand the extra tension.

I've been handed a totalled violin (broken neck - body in decent shape, but cheap enough to be not worth repair) and asked to make something of it as a gift.  I've carefully removed the shattered neck and the top, and am going to try to make a nice violin-shaped jewelry box.

Here's the question: the top has several small surface dings and scratches and the spot where the chinrest was attached has been dented and blackened.  Given the fact that this object will never again be used to make music, is there anything I can do to fix these small blemishes without resorting to a total refinish?

I have a fair amount of experience as a woodworker and as a novice luthier, but am not really familiar with what's possible with the finish of a violin, since the normal advice is to leave it alone or take it to a proper luthier.  All of my experience has been creating new things, not restoring old ones - so this is a new adventure.

In my finishing arsenal, if it helps:

* spirits and shellac for french polishing
* Various hardening oils/blends (tru-oil, boiled linseed, danish oil)
* Polyurethane
* Solvents galore
* Wax buff/polish system (tripoli, white diamond, carnuba)

I'm looking for some troubleshoot advice so I know what connections to look at more closely. The guitar has one master volume, one tone, and a 3-way switch.

The pickups are SD JB and Jazz and the first question involves switching pickups: 

* In the neck only position, everything is good. The neck pickup is activated and no sound comes out of the bridge (I test by tapping a screwdriver on the pole pieces and listening). 

* In the middle position, both the JB and Jazz are sending a signal. Good. 

* In the bridge only position, sound again comes from both as if the switch is in the middle position.

I don't know much about electronics but I feel this is an easy fix? Perhaps the solder joints are touching on the switch tongues where they shouldn't be touching?

The second question involves the volume knob. It might be the new pickups, but it seems like when I back off the volume, the sound ramps down much more quickly than did the old stock pickups.

Another general question, the solder blob on the volume pot is ugly as shit. Not smooth and pretty gnarly looking.

I want to tune it EADGBEBE, and I want to make sure that the low E is tight enough to play without being floppy and buzzy. I spent some time playing with a string tension calculator and I came up with gauges 9-12-16-24-32-44-68-92 on a guitar with a 28"" scale. This produces tensions of between 15.9 and 22.2 pounds per string, for a total of 155 pounds across the 8 strings. 


My question is: is that tight enough? I read conflicting sources: one said that most guitars need between 20 and 30 pounds of tension per string in order to be playable, whereas my calculator says that for a standard 25.5"" guitar a 9-gauge only has about 14 pounds of tension.


What are the optimal tensions for guitar strings? Is 16-22 pounds per string reasonable? If it makes any difference, I plan to play a lot of blues and jazz, so I'd like to keep the low strings nice and taut but I'd like the high strings to have a bit of flex to them for bending purposes.

I'm in Belgian climate, so freezing to about -10°C in winter nights and hitting as high as 35°C in the summer. The shed is about 30m from my house, so connecting it to central heating is not really an option.

1. Put 8cm thick PU plating on the inside of the shed's walls and roof. 2. Finish it off with OSB plating (great to just screw in hooks, rails and shelves for tools).
3. Install an electric heater, just to keep the place from freezing in the winter. With the isolation, that should keep the heating costs to a minimum.

Now, does this sound like a really bad idea, or do you think it's feasable?
Will I need some kind of humidity control?

I've been reading a lot in this subreddit and on the sites you link to from here. So I was thinking of going at it like this:

1. I thought about first building a cheap kit guitar, probably a guitarfetish kit or something. (Anyone made one of those yet? Are they any good?). This will allow me to practice skills like staining, finishing, doing electronics, setting up the guitar, etc. The kits seems quite easy when it comes to the assembly, but the finishing is definitely a skillset I have yet to acquire.

2. Second step for me would be to make a new body from scratch for one of my guitars. This will allow me to practice some more advanced woodworking. I might repeat this step if I'm not satisfied with the result.

3. Next up: neck time. I want to make a new bolt-on neck for the body I made in step 2. Getting the fretwork and the contour right is the part that scares me. I'll repeat this step until I'm satisfied with the neck I can make. 

4. Use acquired skills to make set neck and neck-through-body guitars around until skills are perfected. Gradually acquire skills to do nice inlays, bindings, carved tops, etc.

For now I'm going to put off building acoustic guitars, as that seems like a whole new level of difficulty on top of the progress I described above.

My main questions are:

1. Is this progression realistic?

2. How many guitars do you generally have to build before you can produce something that plays well?",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_svdff,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/svdff/need_advice_getting_into_guitar_building/,

Recently, I put together a telecaster (http://imgur.com/a/6MwKC) and mighty fine it is too, but now I want to go whole hog and make something.

But I have a few preliminary questions about ideas I have that I could use an expert opinion on. I did do a search, here and on Google, but couldn't find anything specifically tailored to what I'm wondering.

So, here we go.

I want to build some kind of double cut build, similar to an SG, 25"" scale, 2 x HB, string-thru with a tuneomatic bridge and a bolt on neck. I figured the bolt on would be easier to rout and for a noob to handle. I'd also like to rear-rout it, but we'll see how adventurous I feel once I get to that point.

But here's the concerns. There's a lumber yard getting rid of a lot of offcuts of about 11 different species of hardwood, things like ash, walnut, maple, beech, mahogany, cedar... usual stuff, and the pieces are all over 18"", planed surfaces and assorted widths. I asked him if he could assemble me a bundle comprising all different species and all over a certain length and depth sufficient for guitar building.

The plan is to maybe end up with a 10 piece block of all different woods, and then turned into a body by the powers of Titebond II and clamps.

It'll most likely be face grain to face grain, which I'm not sure about in terms of rigidity and maybe the whole construction is a silly idea and doomed to fail, or it could be awesome. I like the idea of a) using multiple woods for an aesthetic contrast and b) re-using (s)scrap.

For the bridge: I presume there's nothing wrong with having a tuneomatic at 25"" scale, as oppose to 24.75"", provided the nut to 12th is 12.5, and 12th to bridge is 12.5"", but, I might be wrong there too. I don't want to use a Fender style bridge as TOMs kick ass. I know there's an angling issue with the TOM alignment, and I also know Warmoth have a $15 option to change the angle of the neck pocket when a TOM is selected which is other stuff I have to consider at some point down the line.

Everything else is to be ascertained, but I'm not even sure about my basic premise for the body's construction.

If I have enough wood, and the pieces are long enough, I'd like to make a neck using the same process.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_r7eub,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/r7eub/guys_i_want_to_build_a_guitar_but_i_could_use/,

Now when I use a stereo to mono adapter to combine the signals is it combining them in parallel or something completely different?  If it's parallel, I can forego a stereo jack and just wire it up that way, but if there's something else going on here when it's ""summed"" to mono I don't want to mess that up, because it sounds great.  I'm using a piezo film pickup from windworld mounted to the soundboard:

I've used oil for finishing things (never a guitar, though) before, but never a spray on lacquer.  Should I backtrack and go for tru-oil, or stick with the lacquer?  What are your thoughts, and why?  Please back up your responses with reasons - whether it's easier to work with, or brings out a more brilliant finish, or is easier to buff, let me know your finish of choice, and WHY it's your finish of choice.

If it helps, I'm in the Toronto area, so I have to deal with giant humidity changes throughout the year.

I picked up a decent cheapo strat copy to be my first project guitar.  It is black, which I don't like, so I am planning to repaint the body.  I have access to a paint sprayer but I am planning to use aerosol cans of paint, as it is easier and I have seen some great results from others who have done this.  So far here is my game plan:

-  Sand finish off of guitar (but NOT all the way down to wood, as to leave the factory sealer intact)

-  Prime body then sand

-  I want to paint it yellow fading to a seafoam burst around the edges.  Opaque, with no woodgrain.  I plan to paint the front of the guitar yellow, then do the seafoam when the yellow is dry.

-  Clear coat, sand &amp; buff

Does this sound reasonable to you experienced guys?  I have been told that a solid color is better for a first timer, but I know what I want, and I am confident in my artistic abilities.  Can you use whatever colors you want for a burst?  I have done some research but I can't find any answer for this.  I feel like I have seen some kind of vintage finish that is related to what I am thinking of but I can't find it on google.

Thanks!

Im trying to find a set of plans for a Les Paul that are as accurate as possible and most importantly, free.  Im also looking for a little advice as far as what woods would be best suited.  Ive settled for what I am going to use as my top, QLD Silky Oak, the base I am thinking just good old Mahogany, and the neck, well Im not sure, but either way its going to have some strips of purpleheart or similar.  
Ive never built a guitar from scratch, but have done a bit of wood work at school years ago and have access to specialist tools.  The very first one will be a trial run in pine or something similar that's easier to work with to get the basics sorted out.  This one may well end up a finished working guitar as well, instead of just to the point of being a dummy body.

Basically, unless I adjust the truss rod to make the action really high, the 12 to 15th note on my high E string all sound the same. This is really frustrating because the guitar is kinda hard to play with the high action.

A google search about this tells me that one of the frets on my high E string is high and needs filing to level it up and get rid of this problem. I would like some opinions here before I do this. Obviously don't want to ruin my guitar since I haven't this before.

The price on Craigslist was too good to pass by... Too good to be true?

When I got it, I didn't have a straightedge with me so I didn't check the neck angle; guitar had broken strings (that should have been telling but I am a stubborn beast...) I put on high-tension flamenco strings and found that the action is totally awful high - a good 4-5 mm at the 12the fret. 

I can put on low-tension strings to see if it makes a difference; I can probably get 1mm or so by shaving down the saddle, but there's not much there to work with. Looks like the neck angle is the culprit - a straightedge laid across the fretboard touches the soundboard at the bridge instead of leaving 2-3mm of clearance as StewMac suggests.

The question is... Do I have any other options to increase playability? Or did I just buy a total turkey of a guitar and I should either keep playing until i get used to it (as a punishment for being a sucker) or move on before getting too attached (pawn it off to the next sucker on Craigslist) (no, I didn't just say that, I would never do such a thing)

Advice and comments welcome :),9,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1aegww/building_a_travel_electric_guitar_from_scratch_my/,"Over the last few months I have immersed myself in resources about creating guitars; the materials and techniques involved, the physics, the electronics, the styles, looks, playability- everything! I've talked to luthiers, and followed internet pages down weird and whacky routes. And I have found it absolutely amazingly interesting, and I learnt a lot; it became a compulsion to learn more. I dabble in various woodcrafts, so to me it was a logical progression to extend my learning by making my own guitar.
But I am a broke-ass student, and a guitar is an expensive thing to make, if you are going to do it at all, let alone properly. So I decided that to save on costs, and to maximise the learning experience I would do as much as I possibly could myself. So off I went, and started to build a guitar!  
I am getting into the later half of my build (I have gone for my own unique/bizzare travel-electric form) and I figure I might as well show you all, and see if I have made any blinding errors, or if there are things I should adjust/fix now before it is too late. And of course get just some general feedback on it, and maybe encourage some of you other complete novices out there to give making your own guitar from scratch a go! It is so rewarding, and despite being time consuming, it feels like time well spent. I know I have not created anything special in the technical/craft sense, but it is special to me.

I'm modifying a strat-style guitar, with the top-strat output jack.  

One idea I had was to wire it stereo so that it would have one pickup on the left channel, and one on the right and then split it somehow before it reaches the amps?  This would mean less body mods (which I'm unfamiliar with) so it'd be easier in that respect.  

I could also do two separate outputs, though I don't know how easy that is.

I'm talking new p/ups, finish, routing the strings through the body, new pots, etc. etc. Basically it's just a vessel for awesome. Anyway, I'm doing this on a budget, and one thing at a time; so I bought a Seymour Duncan Vintage '54 Lead (STL-1) and dropped it in the other day. (Had to chisel out some wood for it to fit too, asshole!) After some trial and error, and realizing I'm an idiot for not paying close attention to detail, I got the guitar working. Now the issue I have is Phase Cancellation when the switch is in the middle position. Now- the Duncan instructions say I can fix this by cutting the little wire on the back of the pickup and re-soldering the leads to different locations. What I'm wondering, because I'm lazy and don't feel like taking the bridge off again, is if I can just flip the leads on the stock neck pickup exactly opposite of what they are currently. Will that problem still exist? Anyone ever encounter this before and have a solution?

Ok, I bought an Epiphone G-400 SG yesterday with the mindset of modding the heck out of it.  The finish is ebony.   My idea is to make it completely black.  Pickup covers, hardware, knobs, etc.  They have a goth model, and used to make a Tony Iommi model that has a similar idea to what I want to achieve. 

So, my questions is where is a good place to find/buy things like bridges/tailpieces and tuners that are finished in black?  

I went looking around a bit last night and had no luck. Gibson's site only had gold and chrome finishes.  The Tone-pros site was the same.  Every other site I went to looked like it was made in the mid 90's.  In other words, my Google-fu failed me.  I figured guitar builders might be able to help me out.

So impulse buy from that link posted in r/guitar last month of that guitar part supplier going out of business sale.  I bought a body and a neck thinking since it was so cheap I can try out putting a guitar together and if i fuck it up it was only $60.  I have a ton of extra parts: pick ups, pots, selector switches, tuning machines that have come from upgrading things from my other guitars all I needed to buy was a bridge and a nut.  I have not purchased the bridge yet but I was thinking [this](http://www.fullcontacthardware.com/fch-strat-tremolo.htm).  

So here I get body and neck opened up and Im looking at the body... The body was given the number 3 off a list of 1-5 different ratings, 3 meant cosmetic damage finish damage, it said no extra work needed.  I did not really compare my other guitars to this one because I have two tune-o-matic bridges a tele bridge and a Floyd Rose, so before I start comparing I thought I would ask questions.  My questions are stated somewhat in the picture album but here they are:


* The neck's nut slot is 4 cm (edit thanks georgetd) wide, none of the nuts I was looking at gave the length dimensions, just height, thickness and depth.  Should I have bought a blank nut and filed my own length and string notches?  I bought a graphite nut for a fender it was only $6...

* Once I started measuring to make sure I buy the right size bridge, I see the bridge cavity is off center?  Is it not aligned right?  is the bridge hole in the right place but the neck or pick up cavities off alignment?  

* Does the bridge cavity need to be cut wider to the left?  I think the bridge post holes are cut right, how do I measure this to confirm they are cut right?  

I have a carpenter father in law who has every tool and measuring device in his shop.  We have always talked about trying to build a guitar, he is a guitar player too.  So if there is a fix or some re-cutting to make I can get it done with a skilled hand.  I am not concerned with appearance, if I have to dig something out or cut it up I dont care, I look at this as a learning experience, even if I have to scrap the whole fucking thing.

I have been thinking lately about creating a fretless guitar, and I think I have decided perhaps the best way to go about doing this is to strap a bronze bar onto the neck, working with something like this perhaps: http://www.amazonsupply.com/brass-rectangular-temper-thick-length/dp/B000H9G1HK?ref_=goo_pf_B000H9G1HK

It already was a bad guitar, it being from the starter pack, but it's gotten worse over the years.  The screws and pickups are rusted, the input jack was loose and I never had a way to tighten it, and there were a few cracks on the body.  It doesn't really sing, I had to put all my effort to make a good sound come out of it.

Well I'm fixing her up in a few ways to make her a unique guitar.  I'm not making it necessarily into a Stratocaster, but my own version.  These are the main things I'm doing. First I'm stripping down the body and putting pages from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy all over it, much like [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/F1gUH.jpg) did in a [/r/guitar](/r/guitar) post.  My friend agreed to paint the thumbs up logo on my pick guard for my birthday too. I'm also going to replace the pickups, I figure that would help the ""singing"" a lot, and if needed, I'll replace the rest of the electronics too.  Finally, what I think is the most bold part, I'm ripping out all the frets and making a fretless guitar. I have no idea how I'm going to do that yet.

First thing's first. I already disconnected everything from the body.  I figured I would sand off some of the paint and make sure the actual wood wasn't cracked and it was just whatever was on top.  Luckily the wood wasn't cracked, unluckily, I found out what was.  Some clear, kind of brownish, hard stuff covered the entire guitar. I thought this wouldn't be a problem but after half an hour of sanding, I realized how thick this stuff was.  I knew it would take weeks of sanding to get it all off so I said ""fuck it"" and got out my belt sander.  I know this probably wasn't the best idea but I figured it wouldn't be that much to get a new body if I really had to.  Now, I tried to keep the original shape as in tact as I could but some of the corners would not allow me to keep it perfect. Luckily everything sanded out smooth and round so the body may not be exact dimensions anymore, but I'll see if that effects it in the end.

Now here's the question for the body, or rather 2.  First, I'm planning on using mod podge to stick the pages directly to the wood.  After that, I'll put a few layers of clear coat on it to prevent moisture and wearing of the pages.  Now is this a good idea? I have no idea if sticking it directly to the wood will work or not. Also is clear coat my best option? As for the second question, there is really weird paint in the holes were the electronics go.  It's a lot duller than the outside and is spiky. Do I want to strip this stuff out? What is it exactly?

The second part is easy, what are good pickups that I can get. I'd like to stay somewhere between $50-$75, but if I have to, I can go up to $100.

And the last one, the fretless neck, is the one I have done the most thinking about.  I've watched a ton of tutorials and I know how to take the frets out, but everyone has a different way to fill the fret holes. I've heard of people doing epoxy, using thin wood strips and sanding it even, I've also heard of people putting metal or glass over the fretboard, eliminating the problem entirely.  What would be the best approach to the soon to be empty slots on my neck?  Also, what is a good way to grind the nut down to lower the action with tools that basically everyone has?

That's all I can think of.  If I can think of anything else I'll ask, but if you guys could answer these huge questions for me, it would be awesome.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_s7mf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/s7mf9/im_doing_a_project_on_my_squire_strat_that_was_my/,

So, where can i get some rosewood or walnut thick enough to make a strat body out of? Are there any suppliers out there? Or, are there any alternative woods I should be looking at? Also, I was thinking of doing a rosewood or walnut top on a maple back, which I think would look great. The only caveat is that when you go to shave down the arm rest, wouldn't that take out a lot of the top?

Luckily I built this guitar and it was finished with tru oil with a shellac base so stripping it was simple and I'm in the process of the refinish.  

Now the problem, I have a peavey super ferrite pickup from a peavey t-15 at the neck that I absolutely love.  The base is plastic and the holes for the mounting screws split during removal making it impossible to mount again.  I'm thinking about buying a humbucker base plate and gluing it to the bottom of the pickup, cutting off the side flanges with my dremel to make it fit.  

A few questions:

1.  Since the base plate won't be contacting any metal from the pickup (the pickup is epoxy potted) do I still need to connect it to ground or is that unnecessary?  Is the nickel/silver baseplate going to change the tone even if it's not making contact with the magnet or coil?  

2.  Is this even a good idea?  is there a better way to fix this?  I tried gluing it back together with thin CA glue but it split again.  

3.  Is there a replacement that gets close to this pickup?  Here's a video of some guy on youtube rockin out with a T-15:

Mainly I want to focus on the electronics since I know nothing about wood and don't have any tools to work with it. So I thought I would get the body, neck and basic hardware from Warmoth and then see about picking pickups, pots, caps and wire from somewhere else and play around and try different magic mojo components.

Now since this is the very first time for me to do something like this, I wanted to ask if this is do-able for a non-luthier or a completely stupid idea to even think about it? The way I see it, I would go with a Warmoth body and neck and have it all pre-routed and basically I would only have to screw on the neck and pop the tuners in and then it should be ""done"" as far as wood and basic guitar is concerned, right? Maybe I will let someone who knows what they are doing file the nut for me. The tremolo studs already come pressed into place from Warmoth so... Should not be that hard or what am I missing here in my train of thought?

Does the neck and body for a Strat build with 4 screws just fit perfectly or will I have to fiddle with the pocket? It should be a standard pocket and fit, the way I understand it.

I thought I would go with Warmoth because they offer everything out of one hand, body and neck and I think they are not bad quality, right? I would prefer that to screwing around on a 99 bucks Squier because I get to choose a few good parts like Tusq XL nut fitted to the neck and the Fender tremolo and ultimately it should be an actually useable and good guitar.. not just a throwaway.

I haven't made much progress on it due to life, but did get the bottom edge binding off (it was in terrible shape), and got motivated to continue work on it.  I have a few questions that are all over the place:

1. I want to bind the edges of the F-holes. How would I go about doing this?  The topography is pretty intense, and I have no idea how you could clamp it to the body. 

2. The original bridge was held up by bolts with nuts and washers - not kidding. I'd like to put in proper bridge posts, but the lack of meat in the thin plywood top worries me. Is it a good idea to put in wood dowels that wedge between the front and back faces, and drill into those dowels for the bridge mounting posts?  How are hollowbody bridges typically mounted?

3. How the heck do you enlarge a hole in a thin piece of wood? The times I've tried it in the past have resulted in torn-up, non-circular holes. I do not have a drill press available. 

4. Do any of you know of a place I can find a 25.5"" scale neck with a 3x3 tuner arrangement? Weirdly enough, the neck pocket is perfect for a strat neck in terms of overall length. I considered sticking a strat neck on it, but it just looks weird after mocking it up. I am aware of the Fender Coronado, my opinion is unchanged. Looks weird. 

5. The pickup holes are a strange shape, and too wide to be completely covered by any pickup rings I've seen. Is there such a thing as a wide-flange pickup ring? 

6. Should I be worried about the Bigsby tailpiece pressing through the top? In the fully-assembled state, pressing down on the trem bar would put pressure on the body in a place where it is completely not braced, just hollow. 

Anyway, that's a brain dump of all the questions I have so far. Any advice/suggestions is appreciated greatly!",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_egwby,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/egwby/questions_about_restoring_my_current_project_an/,

I'm wondering if any of you can give me your input on acoustic guitars.  I've always been mostly an electric player and never gave myself the budget to pop into a decent acoustic.  
Anyhow, I suppose I'd better get to the point,  
  
I wan't to know what you guys think about the different parts of acoustic guitars. How sound-holes shape the sound.   What do you guys think of different woods?  Perhaps the patterns and structure inside of the guitar.   
Personally, I value a bassy, rich, acoustic sound.  As opposed to a trebley more, I guess, accurate sound (if that makes sense).   
 I once played a custom Taylor that was perfect.  (Price to go with it though).  And then in my local store I played a Martin D-28 that sounds beautiful and plays smooth as could be.  Then there's a Martin HD-28 that sounds dull.   However, at another store, I played a HD-28 that outperforms their copy of the D-28 tremendously with a Breedlove that was $1000 less that wasn't too shabby.   
So finally, I played a 58-Gibson that was right in the middle of all of them.  
I'm looking for input from those of you who have built guitars, and really felt out their personal opinions on what does what.  Down to the strings, if necessary.   
Like I said, I'm into a bassy, rich, broad sound, even it that's a little more 'muddy.'

Recently, however, I have noticed that there is a tiny bit of fretbuzz on a lot of frets, the wood has started to get white in the grains (drying up?) and the frets almost look like they're rising up from the fretboard (by about 0.25 - 0.5 mil) at their centres, followed by small hairline cracks in the binding at the fret positions much like [this image](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2047/2197800549_bd471c7eeb_z.jpg?zz=1) but only adjacent to the frets.

This will be the 3rd official neck I've started, and the first I intend to finish. My last 2 builds were over a decade ago and now I've finally got the room that I've always required.

I've seen a couple different ways to go about making the neck, which will have a 15 degree angled back headstock.

1) Cut a single piece neck toward the nut at a 15 degree downward angle, flip the headstock portion and glue to the underside of the blank(after sanding/planing,etc). This is the method I've used before and it works great. The con of this, however, is it leaves a weaker joint behind the nut.

2) After watching Ben of Crimson Guitars on his Youtube channel, it seems he makes a side view cross section of the neck, headstock and all, repeats 3x and laminates. What I like about this is you are able to get what I think would be a stronger neck due to the fact that you're not using a single piece, but you're using possibly 3 different grain directions to control and reduce future twist or warp. Another thing I like about this method is a volute can easily be incorporated behind the nut, strengthening a notoriously weak point on the guitar's neck. The only real drawback is the headstock will have end grain on the surface, which will weaken it in the event of a fall. This can be remedied with a headstock top laminate(no veneer). 

So I've already started method 1 on the least desirable end of the 1x6x8' maple board I bought, but the more I work on this neck blank, the more I think that I'm using the least desirable method for making a neck. 

What are your thoughts? How do you build your necks? Thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,t3_1ewtil,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/1ewtil/2_tried_and_true_methods_which_path_to_take/,

When I remove the neck, the fingerboard pops back into place and a straightedge shows the frets are level. I believe this happened when I removed the pickguard to work on wiring without loosening up the neck first.

1) extreme fret levelling on the last few frets. (yuck)

3) a new neck (ouch)

Currently I am preparing to stain a guitar. It's a poplar body, unfinished, and it is a little ""hairy,"" meaning it needs to be sanded. The things I have are; the guitar, a bottle of 1 oz. dye per 2 quarts stain by Transtone, sand paper from 220 to 400 grit, and a sand block.

I don't really have the money to mess up, and this is my first guitar build... Any advice would really be appreciated!

I started working on my first guitar project last week, using a large slab of solid walnut. Unfortunately, the slab had two large cracks and several smaller ones through it which were unavoidable in the creation of the blank and later the body. The slab had been in the shop for at least five years prior to my starting on this project, so I imagine that it won't progress much further, if at all. The blank was planed to 1 3/8"".


**Questions -** 

1. How would I go about repairing the cracks in a way that wouldn't ruin the appearance or sound of the finished instrument? I've read on other sites and they've suggested using CA glue. Will this suffice? Are there any other (better) options? How big of a mistake have I made waiting this long in the process to attempt repair? Images are attached at the end of the post.

2. I also made a ""cheese board"" from a smaller slab of the same tree three years ago, finished it with mineral oil.(http://i.imgur.com/5Afqs.jpg) Do any of you have a favorite finish to use when working with walnut? Would any of you advise against attempting a french polish the first time around?

3. How difficult are inlays to do? I was thinking of using them to cover the cracks if the repair didn't look very nice.

4. Could a cheap old soldering iron be used to burn a logo into the headstock after the neck is bought/constructed?

The new pickups came with machine type screws and also springs, whereas the existing pickups are installed with wood screws and have a foam backing with springs built into the foam.

My first thought was to just install the new pickups by putting the wood screws through the holes in the new pickups and then putting the spring between the pickup and the wood.  This is where I ran into a problem.

The screws are a little too big for the holes, and half way thru the screw, the threading ends.  So I can't simply thread the screw all the way through, it gets stuck.

My question is.  Am I doing this right?  Should I drill a hole the size of the screw into these existing holes (aka make them a little bit bigger) and then proceed?  I just wanted the opinion of someone more experienced before I proceed with this type of operation since I don't want to ruin anything.  Also, where the holes are on the DiMarzio are small but are made of a material that is malleable, whereas the original pickups have much larger holes and are made of metal.

As a side note, why would they include machine screws only with the new pickups?  I've never seen a pickup that wasn't installed with wood screws and clearly machine screws can't be used on wood.

the fender 250k pot lets more through than a 500k pot, and emgs use 20-25k pots to allow for even more output.  i bought some 10k pots at radioshack, and i'm worried to put them in a guitar without asking for some expert advice.

the wiring will be as follows...  single tele bridge- 3 way switch- pos1=250k pos 2=250k and engage an oil/paper esquire circuit pos 3=10k...

I've been working on a beat up Telecaster for a while now, and have the body sanded down and refinished. It looks great. Problem is, I just went to put the neck in and it turns out I sanded down the body a lot more than I realized. There's almost a 1/4"" gap between the top of the body and the wear mark on the neck where the body used to come up to. I assume this will make it a pain to set the action and pickup height properly, plus it just looks crappy.

So I need to make the neck pocket deeper. I'm fairly handy, but this is the first time I've tried my hand at luthiery (besides electronics work). What's the best way to shave off almost 1/4"" from the neck pocket without altering the angle or damaging the finish?

I play the guitar myself (or rather, I'm learning to) and have always enjoyed making/fixing things and well, long story short, I've decided after much consideration that I would really like to become a Luthier. So, if you wouldn't mind I'd really appreciate if some of you could answer some of my questions.

I'll just write them out in a list for ease of reading, please feel free to comment if you have any advice about any of these points:

1. On a scale of 1-10, how difficult is it to make a living in this job?

2. What is the best way to learn the skills required?

3. Do most work self-employed, and if not where do you work?

4. Do you enjoy your work?

I've been researching guitar making projects so I could have a go myself and see how I take to it, but I have very little money right now. I am unemployed so have a lot of time but not much to spend so could someone advise me on starting my own project, specifically:

1. What are the absolute minimum tools I would need? And i mean MINIMUM. I have a basic tools like screwdrivers, hammer, drill etc. and I don't mind using hand tools even if it takes much longer, as I say I've no shortage of time. I don't want to go out and buy expensive power tools like a router if I don't absolutely have to.

2. Would it be better to start with something easier, like say a mandolin or even cigar box guitar (obviously this would be easier but would I gain best experience from this)?

3. Is acoustic or electric easier for a beginner?

4. I have the neck, bridge and other parts from a beat up old strat copy I was thinking about fixing, would it be a good idea for a first project to just make a new body for this?


Finally, I have also been looking into luthier courses, if you have the time to have a quick look at these links I've found for local (to me) Lutherie schools and advise me on which looks best as well I would be very grateful. These links I've provided go straight to the syllabus/course details page so you won't need to search around their websites for the important details:

Edited out irrelevant text.

I adopted this old, abused Beltone for next to nothing at a garage sale. It has an awesome tone I really like and don't have in any of my other guitars, so I want to nurse her back to health for use as my main guitar.  I have some experience with adjustments and setup, but not major repairs, so this will be a learning project as well.

The first major hurdle has been resetting the neck, as it looks like some previous owner tried to fix. The neck is bolton, but was also glued with a very flexible glue, so the neck was bent forward enough that the action was over half inch above the 12th fret. 

I have since carefully removed the neck, shimmed and reglued the neck in a better position (bolt holes are heavily worn and don't clamp the plate down hard enough to hold the neck on their own. But there are a couple issues that weren't immediately apparent until I got some light strings on it,  and I'm hoping I can correct them without having to replace the neck (which I can do, i have a steam kit to loosen the glue).

First issue is that the bridge end of the neck has an ever so slight curve upward from sitting in a bad position so long, such that there is some fret buzz when playing above the twelfth fret, and results in a 16th gap between this end of the fretboard and the body. Can I correct this somehow?

Second issue is that it looks like the truss nut was wound all the way off, I am assuming a previous owner tried to correct the action playing with the truss.  The truss needs a little adjustment, but once I tighten the nut, it becomes pretty resistant quickly, and doesn't seem to have any effect on the neck.  Of course I'm leery of forcing it beyond where reistance is first met. Is there anything else I can try, or am I left with no choice but to remove the fretboard and see if I can fix or replace the truss?

I'm on a very tight budget (3 kids!) so please keep this in mind. If needs be I can post pics if it helps.

Thanks guys.

Finally found some wood in the back of my friend's dad's shop and cut out the chunk we're going to use. We're going to attempt to make the body and neck from all one piece, but there's a good probability we'll screw it up and just have to chop it off and order one. 

In the album is the large piece of curly maple we found, and the chunk we cut off. We used the far end because the larger side had some rather large holes in it that the bark extended through, so it didn't really work. There are some cracks that go through the wood, but none of them are very wide, would that be a problem?

I put together a cart on Guitar Fetish, and could use some help making sure it's all complete and making sure I got the right parts. I'm going to  do a Strat with 3 toggle switches.

Jack Plate

Classic Strap Buttons

Geniune Aged Bone Nut 43mm(There was also 42mm, but I assume the difference isn't important if I'm trying to make my own neck)

Gotoh Locking Tuners

Premium Overwound Alcino Strat Pickups
