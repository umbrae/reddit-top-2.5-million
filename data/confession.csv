1353876219.0,2356,self.confession,13rvnp,(UPDATE) Hi Reddit.

So, my wife got back on Monday and she was off for a week. Tomorrow she is heading out again. She told me to put it on tonight but I told her no, sorry. She huffed and puffed and threatened me, then yelled at me, then cried... I told her I smashed both devices with a hammer and now she's at her sisters house and refuses to come home. She's going to have to just deal with it.

1360822286.0,1793,self.confession,18i0nd,I've been wearing women's underwear for six months to keep my wife oblivious to the fact that I cheated on her. ,2264,471,535,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18i0nd/ive_been_wearing_womens_underwear_for_six_months/,"I've been having a long-term affair with a young woman who works for me that is still ongoing. I know reddit likes to crucify cheaters, but my wife cut me off sexually years ago with no regard for how hurt and rejected this has made me. And yes, I have tried everything to fix it. She refuses therapy. She sees nothing wrong with her having no libido and doesn't understand why my hand doesn't suffice. Hence, I get my physical intimacy needs met elsewhere. And I refuse to divorce because I want to see my children every day. With that out of the way...

Six months ago, I had purchased a few pairs of sexy panties for my girlfriend. I had them all, I thought, safely stuffed into my jacket pocket. However, one must've slipped loose when I left for work that morning, because when I came home I found my wife sitting on the couch with the most furious look on her face and one of the pairs of panties sitting on the coffee table. My wife just looked at me as I looked down at them then slowly stalked off to our bedroom. 

I don't know why the idea came to me, but it hit me as soon as she left the room and I knew I had to act immediately and that I had to be quick and silent. Thankfully, my girlfriend had been out sick at work and I still had the other two pairs of panties in my jacket pocket. 

Quick as a flash and quiet as a ninja, I stepped out of my shoes and dropped my trousers. Then I whipped off my boxers and stuffed them under the couch. Then I squeezed my big ass into one of the pairs of panties, yanked my trousers back up and stepped back into my shoes. 

It was honestly impressive. I bet I got undressed and redressed in all of five seconds before I was headed up the stairs after my wife. 

I found her sitting on the bed, still looking furious. I said, in my most soothing tone, ""Honey, it's not what it looks like.""

Then I dropped my pants and let my wife see me, her six foot fall husband, in little pink panties as if I had been wearing them from the moment I walked in the door. 

We had a long talk after that. My wife was confused, and a little hurt, that I'd never confessed my supposed fetish to her, but it was minor compared to the fury of earlier. In the end, she was perfectly accepting of it and encouraged me to continue to do so if it made me happy, but never to hide it from her and to not let our children know. 

So, that's why I wear panties to work every day now. Fuck my life. ",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_18i0nd,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18i0nd/ive_been_wearing_womens_underwear_for_six_months/,

I found out my wife WAS cheating - multiple text messages, voicemails, emails... and pictures from her cell phone all confirming this. 

Got a lawyer, made backups of all evidence, told her NOTHING of what I know. She cried and asked why I asked for a divorce. My answer ""I don't trust you and I do not love you anymore. My lawyer will be in contact with you."" I moved out to an efficiency apartment and left the car that was in her name. I'm taking the bus to work now.

I'll rebuild my life. My lawyer guarantees this will be the easiest alimony case he'll ever have (after the overwhelming evidence) but possibly not custody of my children. I never mentioned the chastity to the lawyer... it's the ace up my sleeve, but I've got audio of her demanding I put it on.... at the very least I'll have full visitation rights. (and her making 5 times what I make, she can't squeeze child support out of me more than she will be paying me).

So, I'm sitting in my living room on a folding chair watching hulu on my laptop and eating pizza out of the cardboard box. I've got a case of beer and a space heater next to me and I'm fucking happy.... I just wanted to thank ALL of you for helping me overcome my issues.

This has been a worthwhile confession. Signing off. Goodnight and happy new year!!

[NSFW]",1711,469,696,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/f95dr/confession_i_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_my/,"In high school my stepsister and I constantly found ourselves with a lot of idle time alone together.  We'd come home from school and it would just be us for a few hours.  Both of our parents (her dad, my mom) traveled a lot, so we often had the house to ourselves on the weekends. We'd throw parties, have friends over.  For the most part we got along.  
  
Late one night following al party, she came into my room just as I was getting into bed and asked if she could sleep on the floor.  A friend of hers had gotten wicked drunk, puked, and passed out in her bed.  There were people sleeping on the couches and in the guest room.  She had no place else to sleep.  I offered to give her my bed and sleep on the floor.  She told me to move over and crawled into bed with me.
  
We talked for a little while, laughing about the events of the evening, and smoked a bowl.  Both of us had struck out with our respective crushes; they actually ended up hooking up and leaving together.   I was making fun of her crush, because he was a fucking tool, and she made fun of mine for being a ""superficial cunt.""  
  
At one point she dropped the pipe as I was passing it back to her, ashes spilled all over the sheets.  She got up and wiped them off while I teased her for being clumsy.  She was wearing a t-shirt and these hot little pajama pants that made her apple ass look great.  She got back in bed, I packed another bowl.  She was moving around, trying to get comfortable, when she slapped the sheets back.  I had a raging hardon tenting in my boxers.  
  
She giggled and laughed at first, then she made a comment about my size.  She flicked it, playfully.  It responded.  
  
""It's not you,"" I said.  
  
""I know.""  
  
(It was.)  
  

She turned away from me, curled up a little.  Her ass was hanging out of her pajama pants and pointing at me.  Every time one of us shifted, we slowly moved closer to each other.  
  
After a minute or so of silence she said, ""We could do stuff.""  
  
""We could,"" I said.  ""But we shouldn't.""  
  
""Should we?""  
  
""Probably not.""  

  
By this point I was almost touching her butt.  She moved and felt me.  ""We're not blood,"" she said.  
  
We talked about it a bit, about how we *could* do stuff, some stuff, and how we shouldn't do some other stuff.  
  
""No sex,"" she said.  ""Just fun stuff.""  
  
""And no kissing,"" I said.  ""That would be too weird.  
  
We had established the rules.  She was practically grinding her butt against me.  
  
She turned and grabbed me, pulled me out of my boxers, and started playing with me.  She was a little rough (we were both pretty inexperienced) and was doing it all wrong.  I tried to correct her and that's when she said she wanted to watch me.  I said I wanted to watch her.  So we watched each other.  
  
We didn't cuddle or anything after and she was gone by the time I woke up the next morning.  I didn't see her all day.  
  
That night, after all of our friends had gone, she came home and found me swimming me in the pool.  We talked for a few minutes, but not about the night before.  She went inside, said she'd be up in her room doing stuff.  There was a look she gave that I would come to know.  
  
That night we went down on each other and 69'd, and that was what we mostly did every now and then.  At first only when our parents were gone, but then it became more frequent, eventually it was almost every day after school.  
  
The first time we had sex was an accident.  She was giving me a massage on my bed and when I flipped so she could work my front, I was tenting like mad.  She teased me with her butt at first, and kept sliding back and forth across my body.  I was poking out of my boxers and just kinda slipped in.  
  
She asked if she should stop.  

I said she should.  
  
She asked if I wanted her to stop.  
  
I said no.  
  

  
From there sex became as regular as oral.  There was a period of about two weeks where we fucked every day.  That was when we started kissing and sleeping in the same bed.  
  
That was when she got pregnant.  
  
She didn't tell me at first.  I noticed something was different about her.  She was getting fucked up almost every day.  She denied it, but I think she was trying to miscarry.  
  
Once she told me I offered to do whatever she wanted.  She asked for the money, which I gave without hesitation.  Her friend took her to the clinic (she told her it was some random guy she had hooked up with).  
  
We stopped fooling around after that.  Things were only awkward for like a week or so before we got back to our original stepbrother/stepsister relationship.  I started dating a girl she didn't like.  So she dated a guy I didn't like.  We were passive aggressively trying to make each other jealous.  
  
We're both dating someone the other doesn't like now.  We only see each other a few times a year, but when we do we're careful, take precautions.  She's on the pill, I usually pull out.  Unless she doesn't want me to.

I know your handle, I know how you like to offer ""support"" to other people here at r/confessions.


So Kate, did you talk to your folks recently? I guess you will be hearing from some people soon; guess what - whatever you just told me was recorded and I fake cried through the whole skype conversation just to get you to confess. FOURTEEN years of my life Kate, fourteen fucking years of my life you made me look like a perverted creep. Fourteen years of my life of everyone judging me, fourteen years of my life where I spent everyday afraid of meeting someone from the family. Not even my parents believed me, Kate. I guess you were that convincing, eh?


Fourteen years you did not own up Kate, you ruined me as a guy - I still cant have a meaningful relationship. For you it was just me not manning up and not being a normal kid. For you it was me being a ""fucking pussy"". You were older, Kate. You were three whole years older. You were 3 years more mature. Two years you had your way with me. I woke up every night Kate, I woke up every fucking night, sweating, afraid, trembling.... Guess what Kate. I STILL DO.


Your parents, your brother, your sister, her husband, my parents, your boyfriend, your friend Shaye and that feminist bitch of our aunt.. Everyone has a copy of that ENITRE skype convo in their email. Every fucking one. It doesnt even begin to pay for what you have done to me and what you repeatedly refused to own up to.
Remember when you told me yesterday to talk to a professional and get help? Guess what, I am going to. Not because of what you have done, but right now I am so happy about revenge, it scares me. For that.
You got played bitch! And FOURTEEN YEARS of Fuck you.


***From a post below.*** (Added for context)

Sorry, I was in a weird state. Emotions and all that junk. I guess I still am.
Kate is my cousin, my closest friend from childhood. When I was 11 (and she was 14), something happened. My social awkwardness and general shyness meant she was my only female contact. I looked upto her for almost everything. She took advantage of me. Our relationship went from being cousins and friends to me being her playtoy and experimentation device. I was afraid to speak to anyone initially. I tried talking to some friends I made at school who promptly told me to man up and stop being a girl. Apparently I was lucky to have a reasonably ""hot"" chic at my disposal and a fag for not enjoying it.
I spent months scared shitless about her getting pregnant with my child. Finally when I decided to speak to a family member about it, she flipped the story completely. I was branded a perv, a creep and a physho who saw his cousin sexually. Not even my parents believed me, she played it perfect. Apart from two people in my extended family, no one offered me any supporting words. For them I was everything that was wrong. Kate was the exploited poor soul. She had support, she had friends, she had cousins. Her friends made my life hell in school. My parents never bothered to listen to my side. The idea of a girl taking advantage of a guy was not very (for the lack of better words) convincing to them.
I begged her for years to help me, pleaded to own up and let me live a semi-normal life. She never did. After 3/4 years of trying I stopped. I thought I stopped caring. I didnt. Recently I got in touch with her. Actually I initiated contact over facebook. I made up a bunch of stuff about how it was all my mistake and how I loved all those things. Over a period of a month and half I plotted like I was going to war against a country. We started talking on Skype and yesterday she told me she was a bit drunk. I got her talking, I faked a bunch of emotions and somehow made her say how she loved it and how she made me do those things. I recorded the whole conversation and sent it to everyone in my family.
The biggest bitch was our aunt. Some sort of feminist activist (I dont know what she is exactly. She writes some blogs and all and I have seen her quoted on reddit a couple of times.). She was the one who made my life hell the most. She made me look (even though I was 13ish) like I was some perverted fuck. I hope (even more than Kate) she listens to that entire conversation. I hope.

***Updates***

I still cant bring myself to check emails. That email went to about 15 people and I dont know what to expect. But I switched on my phone to a flurry of voicemails from my mom and one from her brother and one from another cousin. Mom is crying in a bunch of them, just asking me to pick up. Looks like my parents want to come over today. I sent mom a text not to. I told her I cant deal with all this right now and I will be ok. Her  brother just said  ""dude what the fuck did you do that for"" and hung up. The cousin just said he was sorry.

Oddly, talking here is holyshitmotherfuckingawesome relief. I have never been this peaceful and calm in years. Thanks everyone for listening. Thanks for all the supporting replies and PMs. I guess I underestimated the power of internet hugs. 

I am planning to seek help. I am going to talk to someone this week. You guys should know you all are unbelievably cool people and that I will forever be in your debt. I guess I am trying to say thanks. 


***Update 2***

So I looked down and realized that I still had them gonads and decided to check on emails. Expected the worst, but it turned out that I just had one reply. From Kate's boyfriend. He said sorry and he told me I could have not sent this to him as all the other people in the list were family(or extended). I guess he is right. Good thing is that he is not going to do anything about their relationship based on this, atleast not immediately. Roy, you are a good man, I guess. 

Her brother called and texted a bunch of times. He is being a dick. The one time I picked up, he told me how I have ruined Kate's life. (RIGHT!!!!) He goes on a lecture about how this happened when we were kids and I am an asshole for doing this so late. (Maybe I am, but I needed closure and I needed this to keep my head sane). 

Its not like I didnt give her a chance to come clean. I asked for 3 years, till she was 18-19 to own up. I thought she was adult enough at that age. 

Looks like I will have thanksgiving this year! :) Thanks y'all. Again, brohugs and internet hugs - looks like they work. I have the biggest smile on my face as I type this.

***Update 3***

I want to start off by saying a big thanks to y'all. I did not expect this to help me so much, a bunch of random strangers talking to me and giving me support. I cannot overstate how much this means to me. I have a question as part of this update.  So, I know for a fact that my aunt has read the email and has listened to the audio. her comment was something along the lines of me still being wrong and how this doesnt prove anything and finally I should not have done this to Kate. Apparently I am an adult who cant think like an adult. All the things that happened to me over the years have turned me into some sort of person with an agenda against the ladies. 

I dont have an agenda. Some people have suggested via comments and PM to talk to police with this evidence. While that might be the right thing to do, I dont want to tread that path. But my aunt's site still has references to this incident. Obviously there are no names. But if someone familiar with this incident reads it, they will know its about me. I found two of her blog posts from 2009/2010 where she uses me and this incident as an example. I would really like to know if there is something which I can do to discredit this. Obviously, I should talk to a lawyer  if I need to pursue this. But before I even go to one, I would really like to know if this is possible. More than personal, this is a matter of principles. She shouldnt be using a lie to establish her theory as valid. Even if one person reads this, it could have some effect on them. She mentions that she knows both parties. I want those statements removed from the so called ""articles"". Is this something which I should pursue or is is a waste of time?

To the good things.

I spoke with my mom. She cried, I cried, she cried more, I cried more, we spoke. She said she could have handled this better. I told her thats all I needed to hear. Looks like I am going home this Thanksgiving.

It was refurbished, and non-refundable. I feel bad, because I was one day away from uninstalling the porn blocker, and telling him I did it as a joke. And now I can't, because he spent all this money on a new computer. It's still kind of a funny story, but I feel guilty about it. 



EDIT: I maybe should have mentioned it, but everybody in the family knows he watches porn. It's kind of accepted knowledge. Nobody really cares, and we all kind of laugh it off, and try not to think about it too much. Maybe installing a porn blocker, even temporarily was a little mean-spirited, but the old guy could afford to go a few days without it. Comparing it to punching him in the face is not really fair. 



EDIT II: Holy shit, there are more deleted comments in this thread than, well, I can't even think of an analogy.

Made me think hard. On Sunday, I showed my wife the note and told her I was going to ask to be assigned to work with someone else, and asked her opinion about any other steps I should take. She started crying and hugged me, said she always was suspicious of my colleague, had sensed that she was attracted to me and had been somewhat worried, even suspicious of me a few times (for which she apologized). We ended up talking about it for several hours, and it was wonderful to clear the air with her and get this load off my shoulders.

Yesterday, I asked my colleague to go to coffee with me. I handed her the note back and told her I could not do such a thing, even though I had been briefly tempted. Then I told her I thought it would be best if we mutually sought to be reassigned. I told her (at my wife's suggestion) that I had spoken to my wife about the issue, and that she had suggested I photocopy the note and take it to HR, but that I didn't want to go that route, and would rather that we both came out of this okay with our jobs intact. (Left hanging was the implication that I probably HAD made a copy of the note, and that since my wife knew, I had backup should any shit later hit the fan.) She was fighting back tears at this point and kept apologizing for putting me in this position, and said she would do whatever I thought was best. So we worked it out that we would both approach our boss together and say that, while we were happy with our work to date, we were both looking for new challenges and, perhaps, new team members. That meeting is planned for tomorrow, and I believe the boss (who is a very smart woman) will get the message and reassign us both without prejudice.

Once again, thanks for the good advice, redditors. If there's interest, I will post a follow-up to tomorrow's meeting.

**Edit: Thanks for all the nice comments, I feel a little overwhelmed. A couple of you raise good points which I want to address.**

**-- Yes, I did tell my wife that I had been tempted, and I apologized for not immediately sending the note back. She said yes, I should have done that, but that she understood. (She has met my colleague several times in business settings, and has commented more than once that she is very attractive and is surprised she's still single.)**

**-- Clearly, I SHOULD have immediately turned down the offer. I never considered myself someone who would stray. I was (in retrospect) kind of obnoxiously proud of the image I had of myself as a good man and husband. That image is now quite different. This has been a wake-up call and I have been doing much more soul-searching than I care to detail.**

**-- Looking back at my posts, I have cast my colleague in a one-dimensional light. She is a good person, a very good person. She has been an excellent colleague and everyone we work with has nothing but praise for her. The chemistry between us was almost immediately apparent but I chalked it up to us having very similar backgrounds and outlooks on the best way to get things done. But looking back, I have to be honest in saying that what I thought was just collegiality on my part could have been construed as flirting, and I have to take my share of the blame for that. If she made a mistake in being tempted and sending that note, I made one in not turning her down immediately and in involving other people that would have been better uninvolved.**",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1374077647.0,,,True,t3_1ifscs,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ifscs/update_received_openended_proposition_from_female/,

I have had all A's throughout high school except for last year when I got my first B. If it weren't for that B, I would have been valedictorian. 

I like to think that I deserved to be valedictorian; that I am truly the smartest in my class. However, this past year has shown me that I'm really not that intelligent, and that there are many others who are much smarter than I. 


Also, I'm kind of an asshole about how smart I am, at least to myself. I'm always telling myself that I was cheated out of an A, but deep down I know I deserved that B. Not only that, but I should have gotten B's in several other classes as well, but I somehow managed not to get them.


Recently I took the SATs as well, which I got a 1900 on. I figured I was just being lazy, and could have gotten a much better score if I tried. So after taking them a second time, I thought I did much better, but I only got roughly 40 more points than last time.

When I was younger I always believed I could get into MIT, but it has become painfully clear that I stand next to no chance of getting in. I 
now realize that I am probably going to go a lame local college and stick with my family. Ugh. 

Oh, and to top it all off, the only hobbies I have are videogames and Reddit. No extracurriculars at all. Hell, I don't even have my license yet. But none of this has to do with my intelligence; I'm just rambling.

I've always had a lot of trouble understanding her, because she's always been very artsy and eccentric. As time has gone on, I'm pretty sure she wasn't just too 'artsy' for me to understand, I think I'm just too afraid to admit that all this time I've been naive and ignorant. Everyone likes to think they're smart, at least as smart as the average Joe, but I'm pretty sure I'm freaking stupid. Stupid, gullible, and naive when it comes to anything outside my own interests.

I cleaned my daughter's room the other day. It's always been a tough thing to do, and I never actually finish it because it's too hard and I don't want to move anything where it shouldn't go. I'm also afraid of using cleaner that may ruin the atmosphere. I decide to tackle the closet, and even though I've cleaned it before, I somehow missed a shoe box in the way back. It had a bunch of doodles, notes, and poems in it. 

I was both sad and anxiously excited to read something from my daughter that I hadn't read before. But with the exception of like 4 poems, I simply don't understand. I've never been able to get poetry or stories that have deeper meaning. I'm the type that doesn't see double meanings or that the author meant something cryptic, I've always taken things pretty literally. So I'm frustrated, because I wish she didn't make her poems so damn hard to understand. But are they really hard to understand, or am I just a much bigger dumb ass then I originally thought?

I'm still happy I have these new poems, I'm just really pissed at myself and really sad that I can't understand them.

**edit: since some of you have offered to try and decode my daugter's poems, I typed one up. This was the easiest to type up, most of her poems are in very weird formats that I have no idea how to type up on reddit. I will try to post more if the first one goes alright. Thank you all for the kind words and willingness to help an old dimwit out!**

**edit 2, thank you all for the kind words and for breaking things down in an easy to understand way. I appreciate everyone who helped me to understand my daughter. It seems as though /u/pods_and_cigarettes was very spot on. My wife confirmed that my daughter was on adderall, and considering my daughter did end up experimenting with harder drugs later before she passed, it makes a lot of sense. It hurts to read this and know my daughter is basically telling me how her addiction started, but I'm still forever grateful that I am able to understand her better. Thank you again, kind strangers.**

---

**final edit: I'm in tears as I write this. As crappy as the internet can be, it really makes me happy to see so much kindness from strangers. This is a difficult subject for me, and I started off annoyed at my daughter (I know, that was very wrong) for being cryptic, then angry at myself at being so stupid, and now I am just amazed at how talented my daughter was. I still am no where near good enough to really grasp poems or symbolism, but with help, you've helped me come closer and made me realize that a few simple sentences can tell a very long story. 

It hurts so much to know my daughter was suffering, and I'm afraid to know what else I might find out in her other poems. But I'm so grateful for the chance to get to know her better. I wish it had been sooner, maybe things would be different, but there is no point in dwelling on that. 

I know every parent thinks their kid is amazing. I'm not exception to that. But I wish you all could have known her. I swear she was destined for great things. She was so kind and caring, she truly cared about everyone and I don't think I ever heard her talk bad about anyone, even people who deserved it. Whenever I would watch the news in the morning, she would sometimes get so upset by the stories, that she would cry. I never understood that, because although bad things happening to people is sad to me, since I don't know them on a personal level, it's hard to feel anything other than a distant sadness. My daughter seemed to feel everyone's pain very deeply. She said she wanted to write stories and paint pictures that brought people joy, and that she wanted to use all the money she made to help the world become a better place. I think she would have done that, I really do. I wish I had told her how much I loved her art, but she never showed me, and I think part of that is because I didn't understand a lot of it, because I never really tried. 

My daughter was 20 when she passed. The last 2 years of her life was troubling, and some of those reasons have always been a mystery to me and my wife. This not only helps us understand... but I feel like this may give us some closure. She made some bad choices in her life, and I did not want to bring this up because I was scared I would read bad comments about her. I know how harsh the internet can be, and I know I should just ignore them, but reading those interpretations put me in such a sensitive state that I couldn't handle seeing anyone calling my little girl something bad. She made mistakes, but she was still such a beautiful and kind person, inside and out. 

Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm so upset, excited, tired, and happy. Thank you all again for listening to an old fart vent and taking me by the hand and helping me. I'm going to go take a long nap.**

WARNING: Lots of text!",1034,217,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15kycg/i_am_about_to_tell_you_something_reddit_something/,"When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account… all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of ""stealing is wrong"" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this:

* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.
3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting.
* During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.
* Once completed I would do a ""fake transaction"" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.
* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my ""bag"" at a later time.

This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.

At the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking ""problem solver"" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. 

Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared ""Cash or credit"", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.

My General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. 

So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked.  I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. 

You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.

Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to ""crack."" One of the most commonly used techniques is the ""Loaded Question Tactic."" I will attempt to explain:

A loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda.

Example:

The question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded.

Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers:
	1. ""Yes, I have stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I was beating my wife.""
	2. ""No, I haven't stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I am still beating my wife.""
	
The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say ""I have never beaten my wife."" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me.

October 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. 

At the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report… he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get ""yelled at and it would blow over."" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said ""No."" But it wasn't a suspicious ""no."" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.

He didn't say anything out of the ordinary to me when he was done with his paperwork, except I noticed he actually checked the reservation redeems and but a BIG question mark around it. Also, I requested the next few days off (about a month beforehand) I didn't tell them where I was going or what I was doing. If I remember correctly, I phrased it as I had to work on a school project (I'm not that dumb) but I was really going to Minnesota on a fishing trip. After three days passed, I came back to work and ohhhhhh man were things instantly different. This other part-time employee looked SCARED TO DEATH at the register so I asked her what was wrong. She told me a loss prevention detective was in the store and he wanted to interview every employee. I played it off like everything was ok, but I knew… I knew this was the day I was mentally preparing for… the inevitable interrogation. So I clocked in and went about my work routine when suddenly the General Manager comes out of the office and pulls me aside and tells me I need to talk to the LP Detective. I ask what it's about, and he just says ""he wants to talk to everyone."" But I knew, I was the main event for this LP Detective. 

I'm basically SHOVED into the backroom and this Cliff Huxtable sweater wearing guy smiles at me, introduces himself, and politely asks me to sit down. His opening statement went something like:

LP Detective: Hell there tweakofnature, I'm (I forgot his name), I work for the Loss Prevention Department of (whatever the corporations name was that owned the store I worked in). I'm here today conducting an investigation and I just need some basic information from you.

He asked me my full name, date of birth, and how long I worked for the store. I answered him truthfully.

He then asked me my personal definition of theft. To which I answered ""Taking something that doesn't belong to you.""

Meanwhile, as I am looking around the room, there are numerous old reports sprawled about with my cash scam transactions highlighted. Also several old employee schedules attempting to link me. I knew he was trying to fuck with me at this point, he knew it was me, he just needed me to say so otherwise he didn't have a case (gotta love that word ""circumstantial"")… so I decided to play right back. Normally, the interrogator will ask personal questions such as ""what you aspire to be?"" Normally the perp would answer honestly and then the questioning would take a more negative turn in an attempt to break the suspect for example:

He did ask me: ""So what did you aspire to be when you were young?"" (career wise)

If I had answered honestly with "" I wanted to be a filmmaker"" he most likely (speculative on my part) would have taken the questioning to either ""Looks like you just didn't cut it, right?"" or ""You probably need a lot of money to finance a film.""

Instead, I chose a different route, one to aggravate this man. I simply answered his questions WITH QUESTIONS. It went like this for a while:

**LP Detective** : What did you aspire to be?

**tweakofnature** : How long have you worked for (store name)?

**LP Detective** : Have you ever stolen anything before?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever given anything away before?

**LP Detective** : Do you ever get angry?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever been happy?

He starts to get real irritated with me and accuses me of not being cooperative, to which I apologize for making him mad (which pisses him off more). Now here's where the Loaded questions come. He literally phrased it like this:

**LP Detective**: ""tweakofnature, I'm going to ask you a loaded question, do you know what that is?""

(I lie and say I don't)

**LP Detective**: ""It's just like a normal question, but it's one that I already know the answer to!""

**tweakofnature**: Ok…?

**LP Detective**: ""Have you committed any form of theft this week?""

Here are the facts up to this point:

* All of the evidence he had against me was entirely empirical and circumstantial; nothing concrete.
* No one witnessed me doing these things I was being accused of.
* He could connect the dots and see that the same dollar amount was taken on only days that I worked leading to a conclusion that it was most likely me, but alas; no concrete evidence… just conjecture.
* I was always quiet and kept to myself at work, I never told anyone (not even my best friend) what I was doing. Most of the time when people steal money, they gloat about shit they bought with it. I knew that was not a smart move so I said nothing.
* The General Manager and the Assistant Manager were in financial turmoil at the time, and I knew I could pawn the investigation onto them.

I told the LP Detective… YES! That I had committed theft that week. He looked surprised by my admission of guilt. He then asked ""Could you describe what you did."" I told him ""I stole three DVDs"", and went on to tell him that ""I knew that secret shopper spotted me and I've felt guilty ever since^1."" His demeanor changed to what I can only describe as horrific confusion. He tripped over his words and said ""Oh… okay, okay!"" He asked me if that was my first time and I said yes because they cut our hours (which was true) and I had to cut corners in my budget.

It was obvious he did not want to pursue this petty theft and wanted to bring the conversation back around to the cash scam. So he asked ""Thank you for your honesty, tweakofnature, now have you done any other types of theft?"" I asked him what he meant, and he said ""Did you ever maybe take any money out of the drawer?"" (notice: I mind-fucked him in such a way he forgot about the loaded questions). I told him never and that it was impossible, WOULDN'T THE DRAWER BE SHORT??? Then this stupid asshole decided to explain my own cash scam to me and I just pretended like I didn't understand it. He tried placating and ego I didn't have by saying ""If you think about it, this scam is rather ingenious!"" I just kept telling him I didn't understand how it could work. So he explained it probably three times and that's when I brought up ""Wouldn't this have shown up on a report?"" His face went to hard scowl and he just said ""maybe someone wasn't doing their job correctly.""


So now he tries scaring me by describing these hidden cameras they sometimes put into stores that are the size of a pin head. Before he even finished I flat out asked him ""Do you have me on video doing this?"" and he responds ""Are you sure you want me to answer that?"" DUMBEST THING YOU COULD HAVE SAID SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, you might as well have said no. So I answered sarcastically with ""Yes, I want to see something impossible."" He gives me another scowl… this mother fucker is losing the battle, and he knows it. He ends up calling the police to report my theft and exits the back room telling me not to leave.

He ends up coming in and out of the backroom intermittently trying to get me to confess to the money scam, but I remain tight lipped. Eventually the Police show up and ask where the merchandise is that I allegedly stole. They thought it was this big box of DVDs on the ground (we had a new shipment that needed to be put out on the floor). When the LP Detective told them that it wasn't the Cops stood there confused. This LP Detective didn't even have me write anything down or sign anything, however I did personally confess to him, but he couldn't prove it.

After arguing with the cops, they pretty much tell him that they can't arrest me without some form of evidence. He tells them that I confessed, but ardently deny confessing anything and accuse him of trying to wrap up an open LP case. Eventually the cops tell him that they aren't arresting me and criticize how he does his job. Completely embittered and defeated, the LP Detective takes one look at me and tells me to leave the store and never come back. To which my reply was only: ""But why? I didn't do anything wrong!""

His face turned bright red, I got up from my seat and exited the store and I never returned.

I heard several months later he was terminated (not because of me) because he royally fucked up another interrogation at a different store.

I apologize if there are any grammar/spelling errors. Once I started typing, I simply could not stop. Thank you for reading.

^1 - I did that solely to fuck with him. He wasn't recording anything I was saying but merely writing it down. And if he wanted me to sign anything I would have refused and requested a lawyer.

**TL;DR** : I stole over $30,000 from a retail job I had in 2003/2004 and after I was caught I outsmarted everyone and got away scott-free

(we weren't close, but that doesn't mean it's not technically ""wrong"".) :P 

I was sitting on my boyfriend's lap because there were a lot of people in the limo. It was winter and we all had a bunch of long coats and such on. Somehow he managed to slide his hand under the back of my coat and skirt. He started rubbing the outside of my underwear until he knew I was swollen and wet. I couldn't push his hand away or tell him to stop because that would have been a lot more obvious then just letting him do it. 

He slid his middle finger into me and started rubbing my clit with his forefinger. He alternated between finger-fucking me with the middle finger and rubbing my wet clit. The fact that I couldn't move or make any noise was driving me insane. He knew it was because I was so unbelievably wet it was almost hard for him to get friction going to make me come. Even through our clothes I could feel how hard he was. 

People were talking in low voices and staring out the windows and no one was trying to start any conversations since it was such a somber occasion. I stared out the window very intently as if lost in thought. I'm sure if anyone did look at me they might have thought the slight twitching of my face was due to me feeling depressed. 

Anyway, it only took about 5-10 minutes before I came. I tried to hold back because I wanted to control it and I was nervous everyone would see. My pussy clenched hard around his fingers and I couldn't help having to bury my head in his shoulder which I don't think looked out of the ordinary. I drenched his hand even more if that is possible. 

I still felt myself having little after-spasms for minutes afterwards and I squirmed around on his cock to give him a little more fun. Although soon he stopped me since sitting through the graveyard ceremony with a raging erection probably would have been a little disturbing.

I've been getting off on that memory for years.. since he's now my husband he's made me come in lots of public places. But I do feel the funeral guilt every time I'm at one now...

He was reading something from his briefcase and not paying to much attention to me or his lunch. midway through my salad he started chatting, asking what I did. He had a wedding ring on, seemed nice, not a creeper.
I told him some, but not enough to know where I worked.
He started asking if I had a boyfriend, etc. that's when he said ""I have a business proposition for you.""
I want sure what I was expecting. I've been propositioned for sex before, especially in my work dresses. He totally didn't seen the type.
Instead he takes out a $100 bill, puts out on the table, leans in and says, you sell me the panties you're wearing right now, and I'll give you a hundred bucks.
I say, serious? Thinking this is something new lol.
He's like grab a paper bag from the deli counter, go to the bathroom, take them off, put them in and we both go our separate ways.

She suddenly then took off down the street, its really dark out, and pouring rain. I burst into tears chasing after her. I continue to run around in the dark all over my entire neighborhood absolutely balling, thinking of never seeing her again, that it was my fault, horrible thoughts. After 20 minutes or so, i completely collapse to my knees in the rain, and just break down to nothing. then I hear my mom calling my name. I walk back, and she tells me that Johanna was scratching at the door, and she let her in.

Background is that my daughter is an 8th-grader with amazing grades, great friends, and an otherwise happy existence --

Except for one kid who Will Not Let Up. He's constantly seeking her out at lunch, at snack, whenever there aren't teachers or yard duties around, and laying into her. Calling her cunt, whore, and that's just where it begins. Every day, she's worried about running into him, and while the school takes a ""Zero Tolerance"" policy to bullying, that just means that every time she turns him in, they make both kids come to the office so he can ""apologize"" to her, and then he's let go. It's made every day for her a constant sort of torture, just wondering when her day will go from fine to horrible. It's like PTSD, in a way, and she's always on edge. 

Since the school won't do anything constructive, and his parents don't seem to care (we had one very unproductive meeting with them at the school - asshole kids don't fall far from the asshole tree) I've decided to take matters into my own hands. I know how poorly this can go, I'm aware of it. But I don't see where I have a choice, other than moving her out of the school, and I don't want her running from this. He needs to be removed from the equation.

I'm not the violent type, and I'd never think of injuring him, but as I have access to certain police resources and information, I have decided to frame him for major (dealing) drug possession, which I am aware will probably ruin his life. I don't know if I'm feeling bad about it or nervous or excited, but I don't think there's any way to turn back now. 

Hoping that posting this will give me some of the clarity I need to clear my head and do this properly. 

Yes, I know this is wrong. Yes, I know this could wind up with me in jail and not him, and really ruin my daughter's life. And that even if it works and he's put away - in juvie, wherever, I don't care - it will never erase the guilt from my own mind. But I'm prepared to live with that, if it helps my daughter. 

EDIT: Wow. Okay, so living with this in the echo chamber of my own mind for the last month may not have been the best idea. It made a lot more sense before everyone started pointing out how it didn't make a lot of sense. There are elements of this I didn't put in here for safety/identification purposes, but in short, though I'd have a reasonably good chance of getting away with this, I probably need to figure out something else.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1367936367.0,,,True,t3_1duaoo,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1duaoo/im_about_to_frame_a_kid_for_drug_possession/,

My dad survived the Holocaust and came to the US afterwards. He had a pretty good career here but personally and emotionally, he was a total wreck--multiple wives, children out of wedlock, alcoholic and abusive. All of his kids, myself included, had a pretty miserable collective upbringing, though I think he had mellowed out a little bit by the time I came around (I'm the youngest)... Or maybe he was just exhausted.

Anyway, he was active in a number of Jewish-American and Holocaust survivor groups. Somehow, through these groups, he learned that the guard who had tormented (possibly even raped him, though he was vague on this point) him at Buchenwald was living in a certain South American country. I remember him sitting at his desk on Saturday afternoons when I was a kid, writing letters to congressmen and international organizations, demanding that this guy be taken into custody.

Nothing ever came of it. I went off to college and, at one point, had the opportunity to go help a professor of mine with some research in the certain South American country. While there, I did some research of my own and became pretty sure that I knew where this guy was and who he was. Keep in mind that this was a different time--no internet, corruption even more endemic than it was now. 

I graduated and went into finance (I'm a Jew, laugh it up) and, after less than a year with my firm, got offered a pretty plum transfer to the certain South American country. I took it without hesitating and began making plans. Again, different time but it wasn't hard: being an American with money gets you lots of things in this world, after all.

The time came and despite almost chickening out, I did it. It was messy and not nearly as satisfying as I thought it would be. I wanted to make a big, self-righteous speech but the guy didn't speak English. I repeated my dad's name a bunch of times and started crying. He seemed to understand and he started pleading with me but to no avail.

I was paranoid for about a year after that. I don't think I slept a wink for three or four months after it. But again, it was a different time. People died in this country all the time. I stole a few things from his apartment to make it look like a robbery gone bad--on cop shows, they always know it was a premeditated murder if nothing was stolen. I never went near his neighborhood again and I never heard anything from the police.

I told my dad about it and he didn't believe me. He was so far gone at that point, though, drinking till he passed out every day, I don't know why I did it. I was young, I wanted to be some bad ass action hero. I had this view of myself as some sexy, international man of intrigue, not the dumpy, overweight stats nerd that I am.

My dad died a few years after. I never told any of my siblings, though I did tell my mother. She just cried and we never talked about it again. I've told my wife and my business partner--they're probably my best friends in the world and were more supportive and understanding than I deserved.

I don't have much sympathy for the man I murdered--if he'd been shot by GIs or rebelling prisoners during the war, I don't know if it would have been all that different.  Mostly, I'm just angry at myself for risking my future like that and wasting that time, those years in my twenties that should have been great, being miserable and paranoid, and thinking that somehow, it was going to make up for sadness we grew up with.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1363893058.0,,,True,t3_1aqwa3,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1aqwa3/about_twenty_years_ago_i_murdered_the_exnazi_who/,

It was assigned two weeks ago, and being a biweekly class, we've had five days, including tomorrow, to work on it. The assignment consisted of shooting a video and measuring things in the video, blah blah. I'm trying to be vague in case any of them are on reddit. 

Anyway, I shot the video, I analyzed the video with the software, I printed the graphs we needed, I typed the introduction and the theory/discussion (five pages total), I found the references, I did everything except draw the sketch of the experimental procedure, answer two discussion questions, caption the graphs, and fucking make a title page. I did the most crucial parts of this mother fucker. And I spent more time than I wanted to spend working on this piece of shit over spring break just because my grade in the class is suffering and I needed to make a decent grade on this to make a decent grade in the class.

Problem is, no one else in my group did anything the entire time. One dude helped me set up the tripod to take the video, but they've basically just written down everything that I've written down. And there are still plenty of things to do for the report - the things I did would only equal to about 60% of the project, so I still needed them to help too, you know, being a group project and all. We all sat down, and they all talked about going to the fucking beach for spring break, which, fine, whatever, but at least use the class period to work on the project. But no, every time I walk behind her computer she's on Facebook. The other two are talking about how they want to get into Vanderbilt (no, seriously). I don't say anything, I'm being polite, and I just give them the benefit of the doubt and leave for break and maybe they'll have something, even if it is only a vague inclination of what the hell we're supposed to be doing. I mean, it's their grade, too. They need this class, too. So hopefully they'll help me out with our project. 

So I come to class on Tuesday after break with all my shit, and no one else has anything fucking done. I should add that everyone in my group is around 18 and I am going to be 24 this year (I fucked around a lot in my late teens, so college was a couple of years late) and no one else is concerned at all about having approximately zero of our required 11 pages completed one day before the shit is due. So I sat at the computer in lab for an hour and 45 minutes trying to plot and calculate the acceleration of an object in a fuzzy video clip and make a graph of the motherfucker, and my lab group sat behind me and talked about old Nickelodeon cartoons for the entire class. Seriously. Other groups were telling my group to shut their shit because they were trying to work. 

I tried emailing my professor about it since yesterday morning, but he hasn't replied yet. I talked about it with another person who used to be in a lab group with some members of my lab group (we are reassigned lab groups before every new project), and he said he has brought up their lack of work and input on their last project before to our professor, and he basically told him that as long as it was getting done, it didn't matter who did what. 

I was scrambling tonight trying to fucking finish *everything* that no one else had touched, but after about two hours, I decided I just don't give a fuck anymore. None of them have answered my emails from the past two days. I guess they assume that I'm going to finish the report because I've already done most of it. But they're in for a nice fucking surprise. 

I logged into my student account online and dropped the fuck out of that class. This was the final week to withdraw, and I did, and tomorrow morning when they come in, I'm going to be a fucking sleep, and they're going to have approximately none of the assignment finished. Even if they start from scratch tomorrow and really pound it, they still won't have time to finish. None of them have shit done because they expected me to do it, and I just decided that I don't care anymore. That may have been a shit thing to do, but keep in mind that I was prepared to turn in everything that I had done *if they had only replied to my emails and drawn a goddamn picture of our experimental set-up.* So, fuck it. Fuck them. Fuck that class. I don't want to be a doormat anymore. 

Anyway, thanks for listening.

He was a sophomore boy who moved into a house down the road from mine. We lived in a somewhat rural area, and then bus would let us off at the same place, and I had to walk about half a mile to my house. He had to walk past mine every day, so we walked together the entire way.

It was the worst few minutes of my life, every say. He seemed nice enough when it started, but within a few weeks he would spend the entire walk relentlessly bullying me. He would call me fat, a bitch, say no man would ever fuck me and that I'd be alone for ever, and it eventually progressed until he was telling me that I deserved to be raped and killed. It was awful. Every day I tried to avoid taking the bus home, and it made me sick just to go on it, but I didn't have another choice.

One day in the spring of my freshman year, he finally did it. We were about quarter mile down the road. There was an old broken shed that was a little bit off the road. This boy told me that he wanted to show me something. I didn't want to go and I don't know why I did but I was scared and he was pulling my arm. When we got in the shed, he threw me on the ground and forced my clothes off. I fought him at first but then I guess I gave up. We were both naked and he climbed on top of me. I still remember the way he smelled when he put his face on top of mine and told me to sit back and relax. He kissed my neck while he entered me. I cried. He wasn't wearing a condom. It hurt a lot. He thrusted until he finished inside of me. I was crying and bleeding. What I did next I think scared him.

While he was still on top of me and in me, I wrapped my arms around him as if to cuddle with him while I cried. I guess I was just so desperate for a hug. Then I threw up all over both of us. He slapped me and called me gross, then took my shirt and used it as a rag to clean the blood off of his penis and the vomit off of his chest. Then he put his clothes on and left me crying.

I sat in that shed for probably an hour or so crying. I went home to my empty house and cried more and showered. I told an therapist about this a few years ago so I don't blame myself that much anymore but I spent years wanting to kill myself. He never spoke to me again but i still had to see him all the time and it made me sick.

Then the worst part came. A few years ago, I was watching the local news, and they are doing a report on my rapist. Within a few months, he was famous throughout my county, and it was hard to consume any sort of media without seeing him. Within a couple of more years, he was someone you'd see on the national stage. I saw clips about him on CNN. It made me cry. Today, many of you, and most of the political savvy people, would know who this guy is. If you lived in my area, you'd probably love him as much as everyone else does. I've seen comments on Reddit praising him. It almost made me quit the site. Nobody knows him like I do.

Well, that's my confession. I've repented for my sins, and I hope that one day he will have to think of all of the horrible things he did to me. Maybe some day he'll break down and apologize. 

**EDIT:** I come back to my computer and there are a ton of comments. Thanks for the support! The most common comment seems to be people wanting me to out him. I'm not going to out him.

1343140193.0,673,self.confession,x2o41,Husbands of Reddit....I'm the man fucking your wife.,923,250,301,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x2o41/husbands_of_redditim_the_man_fucking_your_wife/,"You know that uneasy feeling you get when you see that subtle change change in her.  She starts spending more time at the gym, doing her makeup or hair a little different, seems a bit happier and she's spending more and more time ""out with the girls.""  That uneasy feeling is me, or someone like me.

Let me preface this by saying I know what I'm doing is wrong.  I know it has the potential to tear families apart, break hearts and create scars that will last a lifetime.  It hurts me.  Every single time I do it, it cuts into me deeper than the last.  I'm not proud of it, in fact I hide it from everyone in my life, even my closest friends.  Which is why it feels good to write this.  That's not to say I don't get anything from it, because I do.  But first a little context.

I'm 28, single, live in a major metropolitan city and have a comfortable life.  I have great family and friends, and have no problem meeting unattached women.

Three years ago I met a woman, let's call her Melissa, who was at the tail end of a divorce.  We met at the gym and despite a bit of an age gap, we hit it off instantly.  She was still living with the guy, a cop, who wasn't quite abusive but certainly didn't treat her well.  

She was completely upfront about her situation and said she wasn't really interested in meeting anyone.  I told her I understood, that's wasn't my angle (truthfully, it wasn't) and that if she ever just wanted to talk and get the perspective of a guy, I'd be happy to listen.  She seemed so taken aback that someone wanted to listen, that someone actually cared about how she felt, so grateful for some intimacy even on a platonic level, it just gave me a good feeling to know that maybe I was helping her in some way - at least in my mind.

So over the span of a couple days, coffee and talking turns to drinks and laughing.  I don't know her well, but I can already see a change in her.  Like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders and maybe she just needs a little fun in her life right now.  Drinks turn to poor decision making and as I go to drop her off, the evening ends with Melissa bent over the hood of my car in her garage having the loudest orgasm I've ever heard (she lived in a high rise building with underground parking so husband wasn't likely to stumble on us).  After that, our dynamic pretty much turns physical.  We fuck everywhere.  My place sometimes, her place when her husband is at work, the car, the gym, the beach.  Frankly it's great.  It's hot, is feels a little dirty and forbidden and she fucks like she hasn't gotten off in years - which very well could have been true.

I think that's about where something clicked for me.  I wasn't really meeting women that I could see spending any amount of time with, and with Melissa, I was giving her something that made her feel desired, acknowledged and appreciated.  The quid-pro-quo here, I got great sex and the feeling that maybe I had helped her out a bit.

Few weeks later, she tells me that she's going to try and work things out with her husband.  I tell her I'm happy for her and I hope it works.  We hug goodbye and haven't spoke since.  In no way am I suggesting that I had anything to do with her and her husband getting back together....just explaining how it tapered off.

Here's where the shameful part begins.  Since then, I've actively began seeking out married women.  Almost exclusively.  I would say at least 50. It's shocking how easy it is.  I'm not married, so I don't know much about the intricacies of marital bliss, but I will tell you that there are SO many women out there who are angry, hurt, feel unappreciated and unfulfilled.    They're everywhere.  I've had relationships with married women that I've met at the grocery store, gym, bookstore, malls, restaurants, coffee shops, ikea, fucking Home Depot.  It is just so easy to spot.  The prolonged eye contact, ring check, and bashful smile which is essentially an invitation to come talk to them.  So many beautiful women (inside and out) that just get ignored by their husbands.  MEN OF REDDIT - you want some insight into why your wife would cheat on you?  The number one complaint that I hear as the man lying in bed next to your wife, ""He just doesn't listen to me.""  Women are feeling driven.  They need to be show affection, both physical and emotional.  Perhaps more than anything, they need to feel loved and desired.  That doesn't mean with your fucking cock, it means picking up on the subtle cues when they're unhappy or having a bad day and giving a fuck. 

Maybe to a certain extent I am taking advantage of these women or where they are in their life.  I used to tell myself that I was balancing it all out by giving them something that they were lacking at home.  Whether physical or emotional.

Yesterday afternoon something happened that really stung deep.  I know this is getting long so I'll try to wrap it up here quickly.

So one of the women I've been seeing lately, let's call her Jessica, is 36, very pretty and sweet, married mother of 3.  We met a couple weeks ago at a bar when she was out with some girlfriends (Husbands of Reddit - another note, ""out with girlfriends"" is most likely time your wife is going to be talking to a guy like me.  Not saying all women are prone to infidelity, but I've met several women in scenarios like this.  Girlfriends keep their mouths shut.)

We start talking, hit it off well and within 15 minutes she's telling me how tough things are with her husband.  This...right here....those words...""having a tough time with my husband""...spoken to a stranger, it's basically saying ""hey, I need a break.  need some excitement.  I'm open to sleeping with you.""  So a few drinks, I walk her to her car, we kiss and trade email addresses.  (Husbands of Reddit - all indicent communication takes place on Facebook of via email.  No phone.  Just sayin')

Next day I get an email telling how great it was to meet me and asking if I'd like to come to her yoga studio for a class  I accept and class is great.  We grab Jamba Juice afterwards......yadda, yadda, yadda....we end up fucking on the floor on a yoga mat.  She's awesome.  Again, just one of those women that seems like she hasn't been touched or show attention in years.

So we've been doing this for a couple weeks now.  Same routine, I get a free yoga class and get to fuck the instructor afterwards.  It's actually been great, one of the best relationships like this I've had in a while and we get along so well.  No expectations or innuendoes about the future of our relationship, just fun and enjoying each other.

Yesterday, same routine.  I go to class, and after class we're fooling around.  The studio is essentially a big storefront with a small bathroom in the back and shades covering the windows in the front of the room.  We typically just lock the front door and fuck on the floor towards the back of the room.  

So the door is locked, we're 45 minutes in, she's on top and getting close, I put my hand on the back of her head and pull her face into the nook of my shoulder and we cum together.  She pull's her face away from my shoulder, kisses me and says ""that was fun.""  

As she starts to sit up and pull her hair into a pony tail, I literally see the color drain from her face and she immediately starts crying and shaking.  I turn my head and there's a guy standing about six feet away from us.  It's her husband.  He let himself in.  I get up real quick, dick still hard and condom filled cum, thinking I'm about to get the shit kicked out of me.  The guy is crying.  Hard.  Not even looking at me, but instead at his wife, naked, kneeling on a yoga mat in the studio he helped build for her.

And this.  Right here.  Is the absolute lowest moment of my life.  I feel like scum.  Worse than scum.  And I can feel myself start to tear up to thinking about this family that I just rained down disfunction on.  The kids.  And it's not like it was some fucking mistake.  It was me.  I sought this out for my own perverted self gratifying reasons.  I couldn't go fuck some trixie at a bar, I had to purposely seek out a married woman.  A fucking mother.  A now my fucked up decisions have caused a family to fall apart.

I didn't say a word.  Pulled on my shorts, grabbed my clothes and mat and just walked out.  They both stayed put and neither looked at me on the way out.  The last thing I heard him say was ""I don't understand.""

So I'm done.  I swear.  This is my confession and it will serve as a reminder of the pain I've already caused and the potential harm that my own fucked up behavior can bring not just to one person, but to a whole family.

From the bottom of my heart - to the families that my actions affected.  I am so very sorry.  I was immature, irresponsible and exploitive.  I'm so, so sorry.

I wish my son would die.,792,190,420,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/19hv93/i_am_a_horrible_mother_i_wish_my_son_would_die/,"I have three sons. My oldest Alex *and youngest Cam* are wonderful boys- sweet and smart and funny. They are such caring boys. I am proud to be their mother. They will be do good things in the world. I love them. 

But then there is my son Ben*. He is fourteen and he terrifies me. I was raped one night jogging, trying to lose baby weight from my oldest son. The man was eventually caught, after he raped a dozen other women. I don't personally believe in abortion, I used to be a proponent of nurture vs. nature, and we couldn't be sure whether the baby was the rapists or my husband.

So I had the baby. And I loved him. I did nothing different. But the older he got the more I noticed that something wasn't right. He never learned to play well with others smaller than him. Those bigger, like his brother, he was fine with. But if you put him with a smaller kid, he'd be unbearably cruel. Punishment only made him be subtle.

He still terrorizes his younger brother. He's in therapy and has been diagnosed with an alphabet of symptoms, he started going when he was 7 and kept stealing lighters. Despite being bright, he does poorly in school- in elementary school his teacher cried and said that he tortured her. She was a new teacher and he was big eleven year old who taunted her and she thought but couldn't prove ripped her posters and ruined other things. That was just the beginining. I'm constantly at the school for some behavioral problem. It's always heresay and I've always told myself that kids can lie.. but now I'm getting called in because he's become aggressive with girls. And I now what he will become. I met what he'll become on a running trail. 

He is broken and I don't think anything can fix him. He's so big, I'm now terrified to be left alone with him- because when he has a rage I can't stop him.

He is going to do bad things. I created this monster and he is going to hurt other people. I won't be able to stop him. I sometimes wish he'd die in a car wreck, before he hurts anyone else and while he's still young enough where people will remember him fondly.

edit: I didn't think r/confession would be so judgmental. I would never physically harm him. God help me I love him. He's not always a monster. I held him as a small baby, I made him cakes every birthday, I was there for all of it. But if you asked the parent of any school shooter or rapist or murderer, they would tell you they wish there child had died in a car crash before they committed an atrocity.

I used to have hope. Even when we had to get rid of our puppy, I thought doctors could help him. I have always been his biggest defender. But I snapped after hearing about his latest transgressions. He pushed a girl up against a locker, in a deserted hallway-he didn't know her in the slightest and she didn't know him. It's the only hallway without cameras. How convenient. He expressed so much remorse when in the office, to the authorities, but dropped it  in the car, making callous remarks and blaming the girl.

I met his father once. I had to confront the man who did this. He was charming, so charming, and very much like my son to look at. He's a handsome man. He had a degree. I asked him if he regretted it. He looked extremely surprised and said ""Of course I regret getting caught."" That is my son. He regrets the consequences of his actions but never thinks they're wrong. He also thinks he's too smart to get caught.

So pardon me if I see a dark future and wish that it would never happen.

After I posted about this I felt enough support and understanding here that I thought it's time I should tell my mother what I'd done.

She didn't reply to me, there was just air and I got scared that she might say something she'd regret, so I hung up. I later got a message from my stepdad telling me I'm not welcome there and that I'm lucky they don't call the police. I have to give her more time and hope she doesn't hate me forever, right now my Aunt told me she is staying with them and sleeping and started going on pills again. I know that my stepfather is just trying to protect her. He was actually nice growing up, but he'd go apeshit whenever he felt someone he loved was threatened. I am pretty certain they are going to tell my biological father next. I am worried about what he will do, because part of the reason I kept it a secret was because I was afraid of him, and afraid for my mom, and for my own safety. I don't regret telling my mom, I did it so that she can move on with her life and know that it wasn't her fault, but right now she is not in a healthy state at all and I'm worried she might do something to herself. I don't know how else I could have told her though. I feel terrible, is it possible telling her was worse than if I just kept it secret?

I was bullied at school and beaten by my step dad at home, I had a friend try to commit suicide and stopped talking to me after I called 911 on him. My father hung himself, and I struggled with my bisexuality in an all catholic school. Probably not as rough and tough as other's but that was enough to put me over the edge. I knew I wanted to kill myself at a very young age, but would get through it and calm myself down in the worst times by writing letters to people so they could read about how much I loved them after I was gone. One night when my mom was at work (until 11pm) and then heading over to the states (I'm Canadian) right after for the weekend I decided that it was too much and felt I needed to go out just as my father did. So I wrapped an electric cord around a support pole in the basement, which was actually my room as well and leaned forward with the cord around my neck. (Not exactly like my father did but I had heard of someone doing it like that so I knew or thought that it was a sure thing.) I remember my ears starting to burn and my head and face starting to shake before my mom came home from work because she had forgotten her passport which she needed to go over the border. As soon as I heard the front door open I jolted upright and began coughing my lungs out. I muffled my mouth as best as I could as my mom announced that she was home. I scrambled for an excuse for her not to walk down the stairs. Best I could come up with between coughing was that I wasn't clothed so to give me a minute. I never tried again after that and it's been years and I don't think I'll ever be able to tell her what happened that night.

I am a long time Redditor but friends and family know my account. I just really need to get this off my chest. Some people know part of the story but not the whole truth.

When I was 14 I started having sex with my boyfriend. He was a bit older and we always used protection on top of me being on birth control. We dated until I was 19 and in college. He was nice, sweet, a real gentleman but he and his family were involved in the drug industry and it got to a point where I didn't see myself being with him anymore. It was a peaceful break up for me but not so much for him. Almost 6 years later, he still tries to make a move on me and to my knowledge he never got another serious girlfriend.  

Anyway, right after I left him, I started dating a long time friend. I ended up marrying him years later. Everything was fine but 5 weeks into dating my new boyfriend (and never having sex) my period was very late. I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. Since I didn't have sex with the boyfriend, I was 100% sure it was from my previous boyfriend. 

I knew I didn't want an abortion and I knew I'd be okay to raise the baby on my own. I had a good paying job and my own place. Deep inside of me, I knew it would be okay. I also knew I didn't want the father to know. I saw how he lived, how he wasn't interested in getting a degree and how he wanted to just life off crime. It wasn't appealing to me and to my future baby. 

So I spoke to my then boyfriend, I told him that I was pregnant... I was expecting him to just leave. As a matter of fact, I put all of his things he would leave at my place inside of a box to make his life easier. Surprisingly, he said it was fine. That he didn't want to be held back and that he wanted to finish his bachelors but that he'd be there and that he'd sign the birth certificate if I wanted him to. *wow... I'm getting emotional here*

Anyway, I went to the gynecologist and he estimated me to be about 12 weeks along. I had a placenta previa which explained the occasional bleeding and me thinking it was my period. The gynecologist said I needed to take it easy and rest but that it should be okay and that a lot of women have it. My boyfriend wasn't excited but he was supportive but when my ex learned that I was pregnant he went crazy. He couldn't believe I decided to have a baby with my boyfriend that I've dated for a few weeks but that I never wanted one with him (he wanted one as soon as I turned 18- which is also why I wanted to leave him- I didn't want his child.) 

I had to endure him for weeks and weeks calling me names and telling me how bad of a mom I'd be. I was stressed, very stressed. I always wanted to tell him that he was the father just so he could stop calling me names but I didn't. Instead I changed my phone number and moved. I went to the gynecologist again and everything was right. We schedules my appointment for my first ultrasound at 18 weeks and I was feeling pretty happy and confident in myself.

Then, at 18 weeks I had my ultrasound. My boyfriend was with me. The ultrasound tech asked me if I could feel movement yet and I said that I could once in a while but that it wasn't constant. She smiled and started the ultrasound. I could see a baby on the screen. I started crying. I was so happy. She put the machine on my belly for a minute but then told me she'd come back very soon. I had a feeling that something was wrong. When she arrived with the doctor, he did the ultrasound. He looked at me and said in the most calming tone ever ""I'm sorry, there is no heartbeat. Your baby passed away."" 

The rest is very blurry. I didn't want to have my dead baby inside of me. I was induced the next day and within 2 hours I was holding my baby boy. I cried. My boyfriend cried. We cremated him and I refused the autopsy. 

Two years later, I got married. Two years after that I gave birth to another boy and a year an a half later to a girl. Everything is going well.. However, sometimes, when both of my kids are sleeping, I rest in bed, start falling asleep and I hear a sweet little voice calling ""mum"". It's the sweetest little voice ever... Not a toddler voice, just a little sweet angel voice. I get then woken up... It's like it was real, that it happened, that my baby was there and was whispering in my ear. 

I am convinced it's because my first baby was ""a secret"" that most of my family has no clue, that my friends have no idea... My ex eventually learned about my miscarriage and he offered to pay for therapy. It was a great help at the time. He is still single and he often tells me how he wished it had worked out and how he wished I had had his kids. It hurts me every time.

D would always pick on me and beat me up when ever he got the chance. He, for what ever reason, just wanted to make my life hell. 

During our junior year of high school we both got our drivers licensed around the same time and we both drove our cars down the same two lane county road to get home and every day D would try to race me, or swerve into my lane to get me to slam on my breaks or throw something at my car. He did this up through our Senior year of high school until he died.

It was 7 years ago today, we were both driving home from school and D was once again being an asshole and was trying to race me home.  That day I decided to try to beat him and keep him from getting in front of me. We were approaching a sharp corner and I slowed down allowing him the chance to pass in front of me. At the same time another car with a drunk driver was coming the opposite way and lost control through the turn. He slammed into D's car right in the driver's side.

D lost control of his car and went down the embankment into a tree. I swerved to avoid the crash. I kept driving. I didn't stop. I felt like he deserved it and he should die for all the torment he caused me.

D had suffered multiple injuries and internal bleeding. It wasn't for another 30 minutes before another vehicle came along and stopped. It was my dad that stopped, a county sheriff. 

He knew who it was when he stopped. He had delt with D's dad a few times for being a drunk. He knew who D was and that D picked on me. He still tried to save D's life.  It was too little too late. D died in my dad's arms.

I've never told anybody that I witnessed the accident and that I could have got help sooner. D could still be alive if I had. Even though I hated him, I wish I would have saved him. I didn't know I would hate myself more for not doing anything.

She woke up while it was happening and after he was done, she put on her clothes and went back to the party. My sister is tough as nails and she thinks like I do, because her first thought wasn't going to the police, it was quietly informing some of the larger men at the party of what happened since this guy didn't even leave the party after the rape. So I get a phone call from one of my friends who is at the party with the news.

I sped over to confront this guy, when I got there they already had a plan to lure him outside by having another girl ask him to take her home. Two guys grabbed him without words and held him there for me, I went into a rage unlike anything I've ever experienced and savaged him until he was bloody and dazed. But I didn't think that was enough... I dragged him out into the road and laid him down against the curb, then I grabbed him by the hair and slammed him into it mouth first. I got got my sister, got in my car, and went home. My sister seems to be doing alright, like I said she's tough so it's hard to tell.

Here's the thing, I don't feel bad about what I did, I would have done more if there weren't witnesses, like remove his ability to rape ever again. But I do feel bad about the position my sister is in, where pursuing rape charges against him would lead him to file assault charges against me. I have a feeling my prison sentence would be way longer than his, but maybe a jury would sympathize with this being my first offense and me having no history of violence (I've never even been in a fight, and still haven't, this wasn't a fight). I've already asked her if she wants to come forward, she said no and I'm not going to push her on it for multiple reasons. I didn't know I was capable of this kind of violence, but I've always had an intense hatred of rapists, and for it to hit me that close stirred a rage inside my I didn't know was there, and it scares me.

And then he put her in the fucking hospital.    
The story was that she fell down the stairs in their apartment building, but she had specific bruises that seemed out of line with that - a black eye, bruises on her throat. Also a fractured wrist, a dislocated finger... She still pretended nothing was wrong.

Keep abortion safe and legal. I was lucky. My mother supported me through all of this. I lived in a state where it was legal to end my pregnancy. I deserved a better life. I was not equipped to be a mother. It would have been unfair to me and my hypothetical children. 

It makes me sick to my stomach that there are people out there who think I am a murderer because I was raped as a child. It makes me sick that there are other children, teen, and even adults who are forced to keep their babies because of archaic laws.

I really, really just need to put this out there. I'm 32 and identify as lesbian. I have been going to therapy a lot lately but this is something I don't feel comfortable talking about with my therapist. 

A little about me: up until this last year I've been obsessed with success. When I was a little girl all I cared about was learning and grades and was skipped ahead twice. I was 2nd in my class of 900 in high school, and was a two sport varsity athlete. I received a full ride to an excellent college, went on to get my JD. I make 220k a year. I'm not bragging. 

My mother died in a car accident when I was 5. She was drunk, she drove off the road and died. My sister was an infant. 
Our father was not suited to that role. He died two years ago, but I hadn't seen him since I was 22. 
Both my parents were alcoholics; it was pretty much the only thing they had in common. My dad taught at a community college, he would come home around 3 or 4 and start drinking, and so by the time I came home from whatever I was doing he would be pretty out of it. I learned to take care of myself and my little sister. 

In a perverse way, I am thankful to him because if I hadn't learned to take care of myself at such a young age, I seriously doubt that I would have excelled. I've learned that the only way to get something you want is to work for it. 

OK. So I've never had a relationship. The closest thing was my best friend / next door neighbor from when I was 10-16. I used to sleep at her house more or less every single night. I would bring my sister sometimes. 
As my friend and I went through puberty we started ""experimenting.""
By the time we were 13 we were having regular sex. Ever since I knew what being gay meant I knew that I was gay. My friend was just kind of experimenting. She would have boyfriends but she would always come back to me. 

I've had sex with well over 100 people. I have stopped counting. Mostly young women. About 20 or so men. I have hurt many people. It's my compulsion. I don't drink or do drugs, I have sex. I have been fired for making passes at co-workers. Although I don't drink, I go to bars and clubs all the time -- always close to last call -- and I scoop up interested (read: drunk) girls. I have an account with every single online dating site. I use craigslist for sex at least once a week. I've slept with co-worker's daughters, random 17 yr olds I've met online, and yes, some dudes too if nothing else was available. I once paid an 18 year old $3000 to spend a weekend with me.

[I'm realizing that any one of these things could be confessions on their own...]

My dad molested me, and he raped my sister. With me, he would come in to my room late at night and just kind of sit there. I would pretend that I was sleeping. He would touch me. He would knead my breasts and rub my vagina. I would pretend to sleep. I graduated from school, moved across the country and forgot about him. Unfortunately forgetting him sort of meant abandoning my sister and I feel terrible about that now. 

My sister did tons of drugs in high school. She drank all the time, and would have sex with basically anyone that asked. She was very quiet, and very depressed. She was and still is unbelievably beautiful. Compared to her I'm OK.
I found out when I was 22 that our dad raped her on a regular basis. I realized how selfish I had been. She was 17, and she had dropped out of high school. I drove all night to our childhood home. I had it out with my Dad. Told him to stay away and that he was human garbage. I brought my sister to live with me. I was in grad school. She stayed with me for about two months before she ran away. I called the neighbors at my dad's house to ask if they had seen her. I found a note saying that she wanted a fresh start and was moving across the country. She took the money I had in my wallet but it couldn't have been more than $200. My selfishness continued: I let her go. I let my 17 year old emotionally scarred sister travel across the country with nothing more than 200 dollars and the clothes on her back. 

I didn't hear from her for 3 years. 
Then out of the blue I hear from her. She's living in NYC. OK. So I go to see her immediately. I drop everything. To my surprise she's doing well. She got a GED went to some community college. She lives in this terrific apartment in Brooklyn. I drill her on what she does for money. Turns out she's a call girl. She makes a ton of money. She told me she only does it about 20x/year and apparently that's enough for her to get by. I didn't know what to say. I wanted to scold her, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. She looked better than ever, she had stopped doing drugs and her life seemed very full. She was happy, she painted, and had a lot of really nice friends. I stayed for a week. We made plans for her to come see me for Christmas (5 months later). 

OK. So that's when it happened. I don't even really know how to begin. It's Christmas eve. We went out to dinner. She had a few cocktails and some wine. At dinner we talked a lot about sex. I have to admit that I was very curious about what her job was like and how it affected her love life. She was not exactly monogamous, but it sounded fine. She asked about my love life. She knew I was gay (everyone did: I was never really in the closet). I was honest. Usually I say something cheesy like ""still haven't met that special someone..."" but with her I told her about all the different women I was meeting (this was around the time that I had truly mastered finding people to have sex with). I sung praises of the pussy of my assistant (this was at the job I would get fired from). We had fun. 

When we came home she drank more wine that she had bought earlier. She got pretty drunk. We were on my couch and we were kind of cuddling up, watching some movie on TV. Out of the blue she asked ""What's it like to have sex with a girl?"" Instantly I was aroused. When I'm horny I kind of go on autodrive. Sex. I don't think I even answered her question. I just started kissing her. Then i was eating her out. Then she was eating me out. We went to my bedroom. We spent the night together. 

As she slept in my arms, I realized how fucking crazy/weird/sick this was. I was disgusted by myself. I went and slept on the couch. The next day we acted like nothing happend, but then that night the exact same thing happend.
The next day she went back to New York.

We have a pretty distant relationship now, but I suppose that that is nothing new. For many years I kind of shrugged off the fact that we had been intimate. Only lately I've been finding the implications of all these relationships. Looking over this now, it seems especially laden with meaning. I feel awful because I think what my sister really needs is a family. It's what I need too. Instead of accepting her as just family, I turned her into just another sex thing. 

She has a million bucks now. She got some big stock tip or something (she's very cagy about the details; I get the impression it was from a john). She retired from having sex for money and now lives upstate and paints.

No Questions Please. I know. I'm sorry. I just don't want to talk about this. I want to let it die.

This school is very selective and my MCAT scores and GPA were lower than the school's matriculating average. I was nervous. I knew I had to rock the interview to even have a shot at getting in. If I could manage to get in, I'd be at a top med school and my career would be all the brighter. I bought a plane ticket and flew across the country to take my interview. 

The interviews were a little different than I expected. I was first interviewed by a medical student and then by a faculty member. The med student was, to my surprise, flirting with me a bit during the interview. I am somewhat bi-curious and I've been hit on by guys before (I have been told I am handsome and boyish looking). I've never had any sort of sexual experience with a guy, but I'd never been completely against such a thing should it happen.

The school interviews many people in a day, so us applicants formed a sort of cohort. After the interviews they matched us with some med students who gave us a tour and showed us around town. After the tour was over, one of the tour guides informally invited us to drinks. We went to a bar and, of course, the guide's friend shows up, and this friend happens to be the guy who interviewed and flirted with me.

I can't lie, after a few drinks in me, and the excitement and nerves of the interview day, I was feeling horny and a little reckless. Plus, I was trying out not masturbating any more, and I had been single for awhile, so I was pretty down to fuck about anything. And to top it off I thought he was pretty hot. This guy, we'll call him Ethan, broke me off from the pack and we went to a different bar. Nobody knew he had interviewed me personally.

We went to a gay dance club and had a really fun time getting wasted and things got pretty heavy on the dance floor. Next thing I know I'm back at his place. Of course my body is telling me I want this, but also in the back of my mind is that if I please him my chances are going to go way up. I feel a little dirty about it but also it feels kind of naughty. I tell him I've never been with a guy before and he likes that. He tells me what he wants and I give in. Handjobs, oral, anal, everything. 

It was a one-night thing (obviously I had to fly out the next day) and we haven't talked since.

When I found out I was accepted, I knew it was probably because this guy really advocated for me to the admissions committee. During the robing ceremony at the beginning of the school year, all I could think about was sucking him off. It felt pretty dirty but I still get hard thinking about it. I know I fucked up but I'm sure as hell glad I got in.

I'm a twenty four year old female and she's twenty three. We'll call her Estelle because that was her name and fuck her.

We lived together for two years. I wouldn't say we were friends really, but we had a few laughs and she was ok.

Anyway Estelle found a new house she wanted to move into. It was closer to the Melbourne CBD than our flat (our flat is about 12 kilometers away.) She was entirely entitled to leave and I didn't mind really. I'd just get a new roomie.

So a few weeks later Estelle was packed and good to go. On this particular day she was an hour away from leaving to go to her new house, or so she said. We said our relatively awkward but sweet good byes and then I left to go to the shops.

I assumed by the time I got back she'd be gone; I spent more than an hour getting heaps of shit now that my flat was just mine. I also got a TONNE of food.

Anyway I got back and Estelle was still there. I didn't care although it was awkward because we'd said goodbye and I thought she'd be gone.

I unpacked all the food and put it away and then took a shower. She told me when I got out she'd be gone. 

When I got out Estelle was, indeed, gone. I went to go make a  hot drink and realized the tea bags were out. After I realized I'd bought new ones I went to hunt them down. All the cupboards were completely empty though.

Oh my God that bitch took all my food that I bought with my money. And I mean all my food, not just the new stuff. All of it.

I knew Estelle's new house had to be on our computer's history; that was were she found it. After rummaging through it for close to fifteen minutes I found the address to her new house.  I got dressed and headed off to it.

When I arrived her car was there. Fuck it, I'd wait it out. I hid behind a tree and I knew it was a huge risk; she could easily not leave all night.

And after an hour I knew that would be the case. I sadly began to crawl away from my hiding place, but then I heard something. The shower was on! Estelle was having a shower! I had been crouching under the bathroom window so I could hear it.

When I was certain she wasn't getting out or whatever I tried the front door. It was unlocked and I was thrilled.

The house was a lot nicer than my flat. I was jealous and also mad because she stole my food and and who the fuck steals food. 

I was wearing a skirt and I took off my underwear. I proceeed to run around the house with them in my hand trying to find somewhere to pee. It was the only form of revenge I could think of, okay?

So I elected for her bedroom. Basically nothing was unpacked but the carpet was a beautiful, creamy white colour. I pissed all over it while laughing shamelessly to myself. I hadn't peed in forever so I literally was able to then walk around, my underwear in hand, pissing all over the carpet.  It felt good.

I finished, put my underwear back on, stole my tea bags back and drove home. 

Fuck Estelle. She doesn't have a reddit but it she does fuck you Estelle I spent like two hundred dollars on all that food. 

It feels good to finally tell people about this. Goodbye. Also this is kind of a throwaway; I have had this account for a little while but didn't use it.

**Tl;dr: my roommate left to move to a new place and stole two hundred dollars worth of food. I went to her new house and pissed all over the carpet. I do not regret it.**

The first was christmas day (I can't recall the year), for years I had a memory of the colour pink and it was only when I was 13 I remembered why, my dad had gotten drunk and destroyed our living room and all of my presents on christmas day so my mum hid us in the bathroom until he left, the bathroom was pink. 

The second memory is the worst, I was 4 years old and I think it was November, I was tucked away in bed when all of a sudden I hear this screaming, this fucking godawful terrified screaming, it goes on for a while before I decide to go downstairs. When I get downstairs the screaming has stopped so I tried to get in to the living room but the door was blocked so I threw myself against it until it budged enough for me to crawl through. What I saw next will never leave me, my mum was lying in the corner of the room soaked in blood nearly dead, my dad had  stabbed her 10-15 times over a drunken argument, he was on the phone to the police by this point to turn himself in early (so he'd get a reduced sentence). I walked over to her and asked if she was ok, she said not really, so I put my bag against one of the stab wounds in her head to slow the bleeding until the ambulance arrived and then I was taken to my grandparents while mum went to hospital. Thankfully against all the odds she lived, after 3 blood transfusions and nearly dying twice she lived. That woman has been my rock ever since. My dad got a reduced sentence from attempted murder to grievous bodily harm...to this day I detest all 'justice' systems and have little to no respect for the law.

I'm currently thirteen years old and have been using the same pseudonym online for two years appearing as 22 year old male. It started when my parents bought me a laptop at the age of 7. My dad, being a designer, gave me a license for whatever version of Xara that was out at that time. I taught myself how to use it well enough that he started using my designs for a few of his clients. Fast forward to age 11, my computer brakes with no chance of fixing it. Now knowing Java, HTML 3, and CSS, I'm devastated, but I move on.
Still having ALL of the money that my dad paid me for basically doing his job, I buy a new computer and a copy of Adobe Photoshop. I quickly, as I did previously, learn it inside and out within about a month, though this time I went to Youtube for tutorials on things I wasn't able to figure out. With my parents permission, I started using a fake name and began asking whoever had a bad logo/whoever was looking for a new logo if I could redesign it for them. After a few months of this, I had a solid and sizable portfolio.  After asking my dad how I could have people write checks to my fake name, he got me paperwork and we filled it out. If I'm correct I could be written to as ""Real Name operating under Fake Name"" or ""Fake Name"". So now, I design for some moderately big companies and will have made just below (not including taxes) $30,000 at the age of thirteen from graphic/web design. Also, I put most of the money in the bank to save until I'm out of college. 

Having this secret and not being able to tell anyone about it has caused many sleepless nights (like this one). I wrote this in hope that I can feel some kind of relief.
Have a nice day/night everyone!

I didnt want to post an update to this so fast but some things happened over the last couple of days and I thought the wonderful people that heard my story and offered support should know this too.

The mail I sent out made its way through. People now know there are two sides to the story. Some of them people were not buying it, but I got two completely unexpected people offering me support. One was another cousin. Two days after this whole drama, he(much younger cousin of mine) spoke about his experience. It was not as bad as mine. But apparently when Kate used to watch him at his home, she used to have her (then) boyfriend around. According to him, they used to fool around in his presence. Afterwards she would ask him uncomfortable stuff about what he saw and all. I dont want to type more details, makes me feel very weird. 

The next person was Kate's sister. Like I said in my previous post, she is a sharp kid. She had figured out (somehow) about what happened between us. She mailed me, told me how sorry she was for not revealing it immediately. She spoke to her parents too. Kate's mam called me the other day. 

Regarding my aunt, the eagerness to go after her is slowly going away. I told my mam and Kate's sister to talk to her and ask her to remove the posts and make a new post about how she had some wrong information and how the example she used was wrong. I am yet to hear about the outcome of this. But I guess thats the least of my worries. I have tasted peace and relief. Its bloody awesome and I dont think any drama is worth losing one bit of this. But I guess I will try and get her to admit her mistake, maybe  with the help of other people in the extended family.

Now

Apparently I was being completely different at work(good different) and my boss wanted to know. Maybe talking here helped, I opened up to her. Told everything. She gave me the rest of the week off and asked me to go some place and chill. So, I am writing this from a cabin in the mountains about 80 miles from Atlanta. I am going back tomorrow. Mad props to you, Donna. I know I am not recovered or anything. At some level, I know the scar will always remain. But I am at a much better place now. 

There are a few internet people I need to thank. 

[havoc_havoc](http://www.reddit.com/user/havoc_havoc), [SvarteSvan](http://www.reddit.com/user/SvarteSvan), [Khalua](http://www.reddit.com/user/Khalua), [Phuzzums](http://www.reddit.com/user/Phuzzums) and a bunch of other people who messaged me with kind words and their stories. And [screaminmeme](http://www.reddit.com/user/screaminmeme). Yours was the first message I read. I sat there and cried like a lil child. There are countless other people who commented on the thread here, suggested things. 

And finally, the guy who owns this cabin has a 3/4 Huskies. One of them guys is a one year old. He is blind in one eye and generally awesome. The guy was going to give him away and so I asked if I could have him. Looks like I am getting a one eyed monster of a friend :) . Yes, OP will update again. Talking here has been very helpful and I know how much reddit loves an update. Hell, I am waiting for an update about the safe that dude found in an old casino. So yeah, whenever I have some, I will post an update here.

*All the thanks I need is just knowing that I and many others made you smile today*

Have a good night, y'all.

***Edit*** 

Just came back home, I will be replying to all of you. I dont have the dog with me right now. The apartment where I live have some pet-rules. I am not sure (as of now) what they are. From what I read online probably involves just a deposit and some fee(which I am fine with). I will double check with the leasing office, go back the next weekend and get him. The guy has promised me he will keep him till then. This is the first time I will own a pet myself, I just want to do my research and know all the things before I bring him here. He is already blind in one eye, I dont want to be the person who brings him to a home without doing my research. But rest assured, I AM getting him (because he is awesome) and once I do, OP will deliver the pics of my pirate.

I mean
they are nice, but i have no desire to spend time with them. Not my mom, dad, brother, uncles, aunts or grandparents.
I think in the back of my mind i have always hoped that one day i would find a way to break free of them all.
The thing is, they have never done anything to me that would justify that i ditch them for good, so i never
could bring myself to do it. I saw an opportunity here and i took it.
The only other person who knows the truth about this is my cousin, so I just need to tell someone.

Also, i am not exactly a professional writer so please forgive my poor storytelling skills.

Here goes:

I was in town for a few days, for various unimportant reasons. I have always been very close with my cousin who is 7
years younger than me (she had just turned 18 2 weeks before this happened) and i thought i would check in and 
say hi to her and my aunt before i left for home, since it had been so long since last i had seen them (i was
busy with work for her 18th birthday).

So we're all sitting in the living room enjoying ourselves and eventually me and her naturally drift off to her room (she is
an only child and ever since her parents' divorce she got pretty spoiled, her room is bigger than my entire apartment) 
as we always have, when we wanted to talk to eachother about anything and everything, with no fear of what 
consequences/impact our words might have. She is the only person i can talk to about anything i want.

She starts telling me how much she's missed me and it's been too long, and I really do agree. She bursts out crying because 
she recently broke up with her boyfriend of 2 years, while I just sit there and listen. Suddenly she reaches a point:
""Why can't i just find a guy like you?"". I'm flattered and slightly weirded out, try comforting her, pull her in for a hug.
Instead of a hug, she goes for a kiss right on the lips and this is the exact moment her mom walks in.

Things got pretty hectic from that moment; some yelling, some crying, a whole lot of confusion. My brain is working overtime
trying to figure out how to handle this situation. My aunt is already blaming me, so I decide to run with it, as I 
am independant while my cousin is still living at home with her mom and probably will for a few years to come. I can
handle being shunned, she can't. So while im explaining myself my cousin is sitting there in silence, with a shameful look 
on her face. I take my leave with both of them crying. My aunt looks away for a few seconds and
I signal to my cousin that i will call her one of the following days. I really want her to know that she doesn't have
to feel bad about this.

Cut to a few days later. I've received phone calls from my mom, my aunt and my grandparents, all telling me they want 
nothing to do with me, and I've called my cousin and had a talk with her, she feels bad about everything and I explain
to her that there is no need to and I tell that it has been liberating in a way.

That is 4 months ago now. I still haven't heard from anyone other than my cousin, who I talk to regularly on skype (her mom
doesn't know). I've taken some time to think about everything, and to be honest I am extremely satisfied with the outcome.
I've made it clear to my cousin that such a thing can never happen again, and that I harbor no romantic feelings for her
and never could. We have a special relationship and I hope we can keep it that way for a long time.

And it's not the first time.",556,88,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ckwtz/i_have_no_one_im_ashamed_because_i_have_no_one_i/,"I go to work, I go home.  It's not for want of trying.  I was raised in a highly dysfunctional home.  My childhood is scarred with screams of terror and physical pain, injuries that would have placed me in a hospital if my mother hadn't been a nurse.  My ribs were broken for the first time in the second grade.  By the time I was in junior high, I'd been beaten bloody by a variety of instruments, one of the last being a 2"" x 4"" -- after which, I remember lightheadedly feeling my [EDIT] scalp, pulling away fingers with blood, little flecks of skin and what I thought were bone fragments.  Some of the older kids in the neighborhood recognized me as the victim they wanted, and would ride their bikes over me if I was prone, or walking by me, would swing a backpack [EDIT] (whirling around in a 360 for a wind up) of schoolbooks into my head as they walked by me sitting on the ground.  My head was used to break a chair once.  

I fought back, of course.  Once, a friend told me they counted ten guys (awkward, because it's a commonly referenced number, but that was what they counted, so that's what I recall) holding me down and beating on me, right out front on the playground, in between classes, with no teachers around to stop them.  But the black eyes I frequently wore would migrate from one side to the other in the annual class pictures, year after year.

I grew up believing my da would eventually kill me.  Once he held me over the side of a skyscraper's observation deck because I wanted to see what was below, warning me as I screamed that if I squirmed too much he might drop me.  When we would go to the pool he'd grab me and hold me under, as I clawed and fought and screamed underwater.  For him it was a game, but I believed he hated me, even then.  I developed the capacity for swimming long distances under water.  I became a furtive creature growing up, learning to hide, to sneak, to not be found.

They signed me over the state eventually, and I went bouncing from foster home to foster home.  I don't even remember the names of some of them.  After getting out of high school, I joined the military, and demonstrated a previously-unknown talent for designing ambushes.  I have nightmares of men I killed, in places I won't mention here.  

But I have suffered from nightmares since my earliest days.  I recently spoke with my biological sister, who is a good number of years older than me, and she recounted incidents of myself and my younger brother being beaten bloody while we were still in diapers.  For crying too much, whatever.

In grade school, I used to go out in the backyard sometimes, shining a flashlight up into the night sky, praying to be taken away.  I also prayed for my parents to die.  I realize now that they also had terrible lives growing up, and only did what they knew.  It is in that compassion empathy that I forgive them, even as I acknowledge that I am a broken product of their marriage.

I was possessed for decades by a single desire for a close relationship with one person, my soulmate, to love and grow old together.  But I swore a thunderous oath to my father after he beat me savagely one afternoon, screaming in what must have been a shrill little boy's voice, that I would never have children, for I would never allow the possibility of what he had done to me happening to them.  Time has witnessed my regretful oathkeeping.  No woman, no children, not even a friend to call on.

I have had too many people try to kill me, or hurt me, in places all over the world, under a host of different organizations and hats I have worn.  So many times when I fought to stay alive, to my very utmost ability, things happening faster that I could keep track, believing I would die anyone and no one would know or care that I passed, but I fought for the grail that someone was going love me one day, goddammit(!).  Even now, every time I hear ""Say a Little Prayer"" I have trouble looking people in the eye, because of the bitter pain and deep feelings of betrayal that I never had anyone who cared.  I did my best to keep people alive, not [edit] **just** those who shared my uniform, but especially civilians, whom I both love and hate.  Love them for their desire to live their lives in peace and raise their children, hate them for their selfishness, driving with cell phones next to their head in place of paying attention, hating them for their refusal to see or bother to explore the real cost of their lives in the suffering of others, half a world away.

I have fallen passionately for several women over the course of my lifetime, but all have found fault with me.  Several women loved me, but each ended up saying something along the lines that they could not get close to me, and they left.

For all my injuries, I live in constant physical pain.  I have exploratory surgery scheduled soon, and the letter insists that I can't have a taxi, or take the bus, etc., when I'm released.  I have to have someone with me for 24 hours after I'm released in case of infection.  And I have no one.  In all the agencies I have served, my psych profiles all said that I was close to very few people, unwilling or unable to trust, which was made me so ideal for extended solo operations.  I'm not angry.  I had amazing adventures.  I am sad, which is tinged with bitterness.

And I am ashamed, that I am apparently unloveable.  I thought that maybe some great cosmic law required that I give love to get love, and I did my best to give what I thought was love, but at the end of the day, when I lean over and cry out just a little in pain, and try to find a posture that doesn't hurt, it comes back to me: I feel dead already, most of the time.  And everyone dies alone.

Thanks to all who made it this far, I realize this is fantastically self-pitying.


EDIT and UPDATE (see below): I am deeply sorry I did not reply sooner.  This was a throwaway, and as such, I intended it for a cathartic release, not to seek help.  I didn't keep my password handy.  I just typed, did a lousy job with typing (typos, grammar, etc.) and threw the password away, because I didn't intend to come back to read the comments.  But I am curious to the point of self-destructiveness.  Then I had to find the password again, and ended doing a reset because I didn't bother to write it down.  I was really upset.  I thought the last time I went through this it wouldn't happen again, so you can perhaps imagine how ashamed I was that decades later, I'm still in the same place.

I just wanted to dump this where no one knows me, because I have spent so many years not talking about anything.  We were trained not to talk about what happened in my family.  *Of course* people tried reporting what they saw, but the threat of social workers prowling around our house kept us in shamed silence.  We didn't entertain, people didn't visit.  I couldn't have friends over, and later, I didn't want them to know where I lived.  We lived in squalor, surrounded by middle-class families.  Our house was a mess I rarely saw in my years in law enforcement in a huge metropolitan area.  Think of something along the lines of ""Hoarders"" set in some remote village.  Dirt floor in part of the house.  Wood floor *with* dirt on the rest.  Wallpaper ripped from the walls, naked plaster underneath.  My brother and I pissed our beds for years.  I didn't know until I was in Abnormal Psych in uni that it's considered a sign of abused children, which we were.  In my military life and later in government service, I had opsec, NDAs, denials, etc.

For those of you calling this fake, what would you have me do?  The hospital has a standing policy that everyone having surgery is to have someone with them for the first 24 hours following.  As for my history, what details of my tortured life do you require?  I frequently avoided showering in junior high until the rest of the class left not because I was *shy* but because I was **covered with bruises and lacerations and bloody scabs**.  My chest has a series of scars shaped like the end of a lit cigarette.  I have similar scars are on my penis.  I went seven years without sex with a woman because I wasn't sure I would even be able to perform.

After a particularly horrible experience when I was around 10, I learned that sometimes you can't run far enough or fast enough, fight them off, or escape.  After that, I started self-harming.  It was my way of seeking control, I think.  I put coals on my skin, I cut myself in places no one would look.  I trained myself for being tortured, because I was.  As a kid.  Later, again, as a young man in place he didn't plan on being, my ears ringing, blood and CSF leaking from my ears, nearly blind.  I don't ask you to believe.  I'm too tired to care.  I just wanted someone to know some of my story.

**UPDATE**: A woman I work with has a serious medical issue which is scheduled to be dealt with around the same time as mine.  I will be her caretaker, and she mine.  All of you wonderful people, I was completely unprepared by the outpouring of your kind and generous offers.  I don't have adequate skill to express my thanks.  You are good and decent people.  Hug your partners, your children, your dogs and lolcats.  I am reluctant to say more.

I originally found this girl completely at random on Tumblr. Pretty much just clicking through posts and source links until I stumbled upon a picture. Her picture. Oh my god, she is beautiful. And sexy. Without a doubt one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen.

I browsed through her Tumblr feed and found all of her other social media profiles through her posts. All of them public... Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest. She definitely wasn't shy about what she posted. Lots of nudes and other sexy photos, along with just random day to day photos. This girl is breathtaking.

Finally, one day I was browsing her Instagram feed on a third-party site when I noticed... Her pictures are geotagged. One. Two. Three. And on... Geotags mapping out her entire life.

Holy shit, it can't be. These tags. Most of her tags were less than an hour away from me. This girl doesn't live across the world or anything, she was within driving distance! And that's when it started. I don't know what got into me, but I started digging in deeper. I just had to. 

Over the next few months, I put together all the pieces from her different social profiles.

I figured out where she lived, where she worked, where she went to school, what she was studying, what campus she was in, what building. I even started to figure out her schedule. I figured who her closest friends were, their names and where they lived (she geotaged photos taken at their houses). I figured out where her parents lived, her sister and her boyfriend. She took so many photos of the inside of her house, I could almost draw up the blueprints. I knew where she hung out and the places she frequented. I knew what car she drove and where she filled up for gas.

To pinpoint some of the locations, I went as far as to use Google Maps satellite and Street View to identify trees and other objects that were visible in the background and outside of the windows in some of the pictures she posted. I couldn't stop, this was exhilarating for some reason. I'm not suppose to know this, and I'm certain nobody else does.

With all the little fragments that she scattered across online, I pieced together a puzzle detailing her entire life. It felt amazing, and I don't know why. But I didn't really do anything; it just felt like a game.

Until one day, on my way home, I drove around to run a few errands first. I pulled up to a red light when it suddenly dawned on me... This is the place. I'm in her neighborhood. I recognize everything around me even though I'd never driven around here before. I recognize the sign. I recognize the stores, the trees. I'm here. It's not just a game anymore. When the light turned green, I decided to go. I went for it. I drove around the neighbourhood until I got to her street.

There it was. I'm driving down and right ahead is her house. Her car. Her.

Everything I pieced together was real, not just a bunch of 1s and 0s anymore. I drove by, just looking at the house... I know those curtains in the window, they're the ones she posted a picture of months ago.

**What the fuck am I doing.**

I hit the gas, and drove right home. I had to leave. This is not a game, *you idiot*, it's someone's life.


I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. It's been over a month since I drove past her house and I haven't even thought about continuing my stalking since. But I just needed to tell this story for some reason. It was a strange feeling, even if it doesn't sound that interesting to others.

At the least, take this as a warning to protect your identity online. Individually, she wasn't posting much information. But I guess she wasn't expecting anyone to try and piece everything together.

I love my career, and I know I would lose my leading man status if I ever came out. I feel terribly guilty about many different things.

First of all, I feel like I'm misleading my fans. I know a lot of women watch my movies to watch me, and part of that is fantasy, and I feel like it's all based on a lie. They do a lot market analysis in Hollywood. I get told about which demographics I do well with, and I feel like I'm misleading so many people, or letting them down.

I am dating another well known personality, and we've been publicly together for a while now. I know she expects to get married, the press expect us to get married, but of course this would be a great disservice to her. Truth be told I think she knows. She is a wonderful woman and a wonderful person and I don't deserve someone as loving and trusting in my life, and I truly do love her, but I'm not in love with her, and sex with her, despite her beauty, is difficult for me.

I also feel terribly guilty because I know there are so many gay kids out there and I feel like by not coming out, and not providing that public display of being gay and being successful I'm letting them down. Public figures like Ellen DeGeneres coming out when I was younger made a huge difference to me, and I feel like I should be paying it forward, but I'm too afraid of my whole life being ruined.

I've only told a few people. I've been with two men since my career has started. Both have been, thankfully, very discrete. My two best friends from before I became mainstream know, and have been supportive. I've told two gay actors who have come out because I trusted they would keep it to themselves, having been in the same position. They were comforting and told me to do what I needed to do, but it didn't assuage my guilt at all. I tested the water with my agent, who basically told me ""Faggots don't make it in this town,"" and then went on to basically explain that he would never represent a gay man because the effort versus the money just makes it not worth it to him.

We talked and, well what can I say? She wasn't raped. She just cheated on me. I am not mad, I am relieved/happy because she wasn't raped, but I am confused and hurt. I don't know, but something hurts inside me so bad. I can't explain. 

She wants to keep the baby because she feels a strong link/connection between her and the baby. 

She cried and apologized to me. I picked up my bag, hugged her and wished her a good luck. 

As I said, I am not mad on her, but it hurts. I guess I would go sleep, maybe that feeling would fade little. 

Sorry for any trouble I caused to you, guys. Thank for your efforts, time and support. You are welcome to ask about anything.  

More Information/UPDATE:  

She made choices that I can't respect or live with, but I still wish her a good life for the five years we stuck together. I hope it was just one mistake and she's still a good person for herself and her baby.

1367520998.0,445,self.confession,1dkgb1,Exacted revenge on Ex.,571,126,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dkgb1/exacted_revenge_on_ex/,"Reddit, I am not proud of what I did, and I do feel that karma will get me one day- I am prepared for it.  I am embarrassed that a somewhat successful individual such as myself is capable of something so childish and embarrassing (I'm 26). I'll try to make this short.

Background: Me and my ex had been together for about 1 year- long distance relationship (he lived about 3 hours away). I find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and confrontations with him lead nowhere with him saying that I am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me (the usual spiel) and that his sister does not know what she is talking about.  I take his side (because i loved him). 

3 weeks ago, I find out from a mutual friend that he has been seeing and sleeping with this girl in his town. I confront him about it and he flips everything around on me, saying that its so hard for him to keep his dick in his pants while I am living so far away, that I neglect him (which I don't, I am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when I have the funds, we call, text, skype each other daily) and that I don't want him to live with me (which is true because I don't want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills).  He says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day.

I was heartbroken, I talked to my friends and they said the girl he is hooking up with is an easy slut that has been around and that they are in a relationship the day after me and the ex had the talk- probably even before then.  

2 weeks ago, while still hurting and heartbroken, I reactivated my facebook and meticulously combed through my ex and his new ""love's"" profiles.  I know I should not have done this but whatever.  I did not dwell on their flirty messages but instead, focused on her profile.  I read through months of disgusting selfies of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a floozy would be embarrassed of being caught in.  Then I did it.  I made a fake facebook profile of a fine-ass looking man from google that ""used to go to her school."" I befriended all of her friends, made fake posts and befriended her.  All of this took less than a day. You would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of they know you or not.  I had about 140 ""friends"" in just 2 hours and at that point, people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes.  I dunno who is more pathetic, me or these weirdos (just me probably). I started to chat her up the next day, she was very ""open"" with herself, even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return.  Being a woman myself, it was easy to tell her what she wanted to hear.  2-3 days later, she was complaining about my ex to me already.  I told her I wanted to meet up and will pick her up and ""show her what its like to be with a real man.""  At this point, I had hours of conversations saved, her saying the dirtiest shit that I've ever read - pictures, videos, what have you.  It was time.

While all this was going on, my ex started to contact me, saying it was a mistake.  I asked him if they had broken up, he says yes (twice) and they were not obviously.  This should have broken my heart but it didnt.   I knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that I want him to move in with me.  He sounded happy, excited- whatever and said that he was going to give his 2 weeks to his boss that day.  He texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because, ""fuck em.""  He was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week.

The Revenge.  I posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook, tagged her in it posted the pictures and videos for my ex's eyes only and sat back and enjoyed the show, before I deactivated the fake acc, I had 53 likes and 82 messages.  Her family, friends all saw it.  My ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me, he can't wait to be with me and doesn't mention anything about the girl.  

Friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt.  He does not know where I live because I recently moved.  I tell him to meet me at a CVS close by so I direct him on where to go.  He tells me he is almost out of gas and that I will have to help him put some in it.  I agree and tell him that I will once he gets there.  I get a text telling me he's at the CVS and asks where I am.  I ignore it.  30 minutes later, he blows up my phone.  Calls ignored- I made it a point to let it ring once so that he knows i send it to voicemail.  1 hour later- he calls and leaves me a voicemail that he is worried and if I am ok.  I am fan-fucking-tastic.  2 hours later, he says that he is stranded, drove to another CVS thinking I was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car.  Calls ignored.  I take an ambien and go to bed.

Saturday morning. I have 37 text messages 28 missed calls and 7 voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up.   Since then, I blocked his number and then had to change my number since he would then start calling me from his family's phone and blocked calls.  I get a msg on fb from his sister.  She tells me he came home crying like a fucking baby and since his mom knows pretty much what happened between me and him, she was not very sympathetic- but pretty upset with me.  His sister thought I was a badass and deserved better than his lying, cheating loser of a brother.

I know I acted on impulse on all of this, probably destroyed this girls life.  I will probably reactivate fake profile to say sorry or whatever but maybe not.  She did knowingly sleep with a man that had a girlfriend- seduced him even.  I know this sounds crazy but the feelings I had for my ex are still there.  He will never forgive me since he is now unemployed and the whole town knows his business (the girl admitted his dick is tiny).  Part of me regrets everything and that I want him back with me.  Other part of me is glad I destroyed any type of reconciliation as it was not going to work out in the end.  Feels good to let this out.

I went out with a guy for the first time. Met him online. We went to the theater. We had wine. After the third glass I don't remember anything. This was around 10 pm. At 2 am I remember being driven by an old black man in his car who kept asking for money. My parents arrived and he told them he took me away from a bunch of men. I woke up today to the reality I was raped. I'm just in shock at the moment.

Edit: Thanks for being here Reddit. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. My parents actually think this is an inconvenience to them. I'm so ashamed. I'm just sucking it up.

Update: just got back from the hospital. This was not my fault. I talked to a counselor and she made me see that people manipulate circumstances to take advantage of their victim and then the victim feels like it was their fault. I was incapacitated and taken advantage of and dumped and it is not ok. I learned a lot today. Care for victims is free but had to travel to another part of town to get the exam. This was hard because I didn't even want to go to the first hospital. I wasn't going to go to another one. Dad as was supportive and we went. I'm glad I had the test done. I did an instant HIV that came back negative. I was also given antibiotics. I texted the guy asking if we had sex. He said he was a gentlemen and that we didn't. He said that I did beg for him to fuck me. Unlikely. I asked if he fingered me because I'm sore he said no, that I fingered myself. Definitely not, I never have done that. While the test was being done I started crying because it dawned on me that I was raped. My body hurts.
I have up to two years to press charges. I'm going to go to the police department tomorrow. 
I may have issues in my life and whatnot but none of my problems make me eligible for rape. Rape should never happen to anyone because no human is less than another human and my body is my right.

Update: woke up today to parents yelling at each other, I feel so bad. This is like a real nightmare. I don't want to be here, in this house or with this situation. I feel like I want to sell all my stuff and just go somewhere far away. Where can I go? I'm a US resident. I graduated from college. Maybe I should join the army? I don't know what to do.

I really slacked off in a couple of classes and was looking at least one F. I emailed the professor about what I could do, and he replied that I might be able to pass. I had to attend all remaining classes, excel on the test, and do extra credit work. For a couple weeks I went to his office every day to do basic work (print out this article, get this from the library, look this up). One day he says he's going to need help at his home office. 

I go on a Saturday morning and it's basically the same stuff, plus organizing his bookshelves. After an hour, I'm in there and he's just writing, then he just gets up and stands close behind me, and starts rubbing my crotch. I was completely surprised, but I got turned on. He rubs a little more, not saying anything, then gets on his knees and turns me around, then gives me a blow job. I just let it happen. After, he pulls my pants back up and we leads me to his bedroom, where he had anal with me.

Afterwards he says that we're done for the day, and I just drive home. I basically wasn't thinking about it at all after I showered, and I went out with my girlfriend that night. He emailed me and said there was more work for me on Sunday. I ended up going there again and that time it was just sex.

For the rest of the semester I'd go over about every week, and he stopped having me do any actual work or assistance, it was just sex. He ended up giving me an A, and he suggested I take more classes from him.

So basically I have taken all the classes from him I can. He fucks me, and I end up with As. He also has gotten other professors to give me better grades, saying I'm doing a lot of research work for him so they cut me slack. He also has set me up with a good job for the time being.

I've never told anyone, and the only other person who knows is his boyfriend, who he started dating around a year ago. He introduced me as a former student, and we have had a few threesomes. The boyfriend doesn't know that the professor is basically have sex with every week. I have a new girlfriend and she doesn't know anything, either.

My flatmate and I had decided to dress up as pacman (him) and a pacman ghost (me), of which we made fairly impressive homemade costumes out of big rolls of material.

As the night went on, the takeaway I had for tea was not reacting well in my stomach with the terrible cheap beer that I had brought with me, but I figured I could weather the storm for a while at least. So when I was midway through having an innocent, simple piss and felt the ominous presence of a fart creeping up on me, I felt confident enough to set it free. This fart was not alone, however, and much to my chagrin I felt a wetness that filled me with sheer, uncompromising dread. But alas, I was trapped. It was no longer possible to urinate without releasing the tension on my ringpiece, and I was long past the point of being able to stop the flow without bursting a testicle. Hence, I accepted defeat, wrote-off the boxer shorts as collateral damage, and scoured the bathroom for toilet paper to try and save my trousers. 

The gods of fate were cruel though and I could find nothing but a face cloth, which I hope no one has ever used again. Even after I had used as much surface area of this rag as was humanly possible, there was still a significant amount of brown paste smeared around my thighs. The smell was really starting to kick in now, and people in the bathroom queue were growing impatient. In a fit of desperation, I grabbed a can of aerosol air freshener and jammed it down my trousers, spraying for a solid 25 seconds. I knew now that there was no saving this party, no going back. I had to leave, and fast. Taking a deep breath and one last spray for luck, I unlocked the door and made a bee-line for the street. Just before I could leave the house, however, I was ambushed by my female friend who rushed in for the hug. Mortified, I basically shoved her off me, mumbled that I felt sick and charged past her, leaving a faint smell of summer glade and faeces. 

By the time I got to the corner of the street it became clear that if I continued in my futile attempt to waddle home in this state, I would definitely get some sort of disgusting rash, and the aroma was just too much to bear. Squatting in a nearby bush, I whipped off my pacman ghost costume and used the material to finish wiping my pathetic arse, before stuffing the remains over the fence behind the bush and swiftly running away. I learned the next day that there is in fact a primary school over said fence. The instant I got home I went straight in the shower and sat down for a long time, reflecting on my life thus far.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_14omce,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/14omce/i_shat_myself_at_a_party/,

1359484909.0,396,self.confession,17ic9l,I pimped out high school girls for two years. One of them was my sister. AMA.,547,151,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17ic9l/i_pimped_out_high_school_girls_for_two_years_one/,"Of all the bad things I did back in my drug-using, partying days this has to be the worst. When I was in my early 20s I dated a high school freshman and whether it was just because of my influence or whether there were other factors in play I'll never know, but she was a really screwed up girl. I didn't care. Back then all I cared about was coke, ecstasy, partying, and fucking. Mary was into all of that but there was a problem. We didn't have much money. She was just a kid and I barely made $250 a week at my shitty landscaping job. One day I had her with me while picking up some X (ecstasy) and the dealer, stoned as fuck, told me he'd give us two extra pills if she slept with him. It took some convincing but Mary eventually agreed and that was the first time I pimped a girl out.

She wasn't the only one or the one I most regret. Like I said Mary was a screwed up girl before I met her. I'm not saying I didn't make things worse for her but I'm positive what ended up happening to her wasn't entirely my fault. The ones I regret most aren't even the friends she helped me recruit from her school after Mary became a proper prostitute. Most of them were also sort of crazy already or else Mary wouldn't have been able to convince them to work for me.

The one I regret most is my sister. She was fifteen the first time she asked me for drugs. Just marijuana which I had plenty of but I convinced her it cost ten times what it did. Keep in mind I was on something practically all the time at this point and had grown used to seeing young women as a means to make cash. I was absolutely without remorse or guilt. So she paid with saved up allowence money, something like $100 for two joints. Eventually I brought her to her first rave and even paid for everything, including the ecstasy. While she was rolling hard I told a friend of mind to massage her and when she began to complain that he was touching her too much I told her to stop being a baby and just enjoy it. I watched my sister lose her virginity that night to a guy I barely remember anymore. He paid me $100 later for that.

It wasn't long before she became my constant companion at parties, raves, and even clubs. Our parents were trying to control her by grounding her but I convinced her to sneak out all the time. She and my two main girls, including Mary, would go out and get high and then I'd hook them up with someone. I would take the majority of the money and they never complained because they were scared of me for a couple reasons. They were scared I might hurt them because yes, I barely remember doing so but while coked out I was known for getting violent. They were also scared whenever I threatened to leave them or cut them off. They saw me do that to a few of their friends and they didn't want that to happen.

This went on for two years. It ended after my sister was arrested for possession and solicitation. I'd had the bright idea that my girls should be getting their own Johns so I started bringing them to clubs where I knew the bouncers and send them in to find customers for their services. It worked well for a few short weeks until my sister got caught up in a police raid. They arrested dozens of people that night, my sister included, but she was by far the youngest.

After that only Mary remained of my girls. The rest were scared now and my sister was in a drug treatment center. I tried getting some of them back, even some of the ones I'd gotten rid of before, but I was circling the drain and they seemed to know it. Suddenly I wasn't the cool older guy, I was the loser druggie guy.

What finally got me to change was the day I brought Mary over to one of my dealer's friend's place. This friend was supposedly really into young red heads and would pay $300 for some fun with her. My dealer vouched for him but I brought Mary there myself anyway because I wanted the money. I was back to being broke and I needed cash desperately. So I brought her to this sketchy neighborhood and walked her to the door. Funny thing is, crazy Mary was for once nervous and suggested we forget about this dude. I insisted though and by now she always listened to me. 

When we entered the room I knew something was off. There were three guys there and they had flashlights. They said something about the power being off and I stupidly believed them enough to let them lead me into the main room. Mary was freaking out at this point, probably because she realized what I hadn't: this house wasn't thiers. Hell, it was an abandoned house. No furniature, total mess, all fucked up. Before all that registered to me I was attacked.

They beat the shit out of me. I barely remember any of it. I do remember being strapped into a gurney and hearing a paramedic say that my lung was punctured. Turns out he was wrong but I was in enough pain to believe it. I spent the next few days in the hospital being treated for a variety of things including a concussion that required them drilling a hole in my skull, broken ribs, a broken hand that never healed correctly, and of course heroin withdrawl. 

When the police spoke with me I refused to answer any questions until they asked me if I knew that my friend Mary had been assaulted as well. I remember feeling, and I still feel, the shame of realizing I had never even considered what happened to her. Turns out she had been violently raped while I was unconscious. They beat the hell out of her too. I think that's the first time I honestly felt guilt about what I'd been doing for nearly two years. Not even my sister getting arrested had been enough to make me realize what a fucking asshole I was but being shown the pictures of Mary's face, all swollen and bruised, made me cry like a girl.

I told the police everything about my dealer friend and how he'd set up the date with mary that night. But nothing ever came of it. The dealer kept his mouth shut and even though they raided his home they only found a little pot. No money, guns, or heavy drugs. He got a slap on the wrist.

Yeah, I cleaned up after that. I've been drug free for five years now. But Mary, last I heard, is still a heavy user. My sister got clean and is now in college but she's had a string of abusive boyfriends and I know that's probably my fault. I was her big brother and I taught her that men only want her for sex and she's had a hard time unlearning that lesson.

I was going to buy her a $250 American Eagle gift card and a $100 Sephora card -she loves those stores- and ship them to her parents house (I'm very good friends with her family) with a nice note for her to enjoy the vacation. Then I found out she wasn't going there by herself; she brought her new boyfriend to stay with her at her parents house (keep in mind this is a transatlantic flight, not a simple road trip)... in the same place I had shared our best memories together with her and her family... So I bought myself a pair of cutting edge Nike running shoes, a Zephyr bluetooth running device, clothes and a nexus 7 tablet; and moved on. Happy holidays to me.

EDIT: Thank you guys for the responses!. I've been a redditor for over 2 years and I think this kind of self-rant-post got more upvotes than my entire post history...  :D


EDIT2: For those that mention that I shouldn't condemn her for having a new boyfriend: I don't, I'm glad that she found happiness somewhere else, but I wish she had just asked for the separation before she started cheating on me with this guy for more than half a year, only 2 years after getting married. I only found out recently about this. I had been buying her tickets for her to go see him for the past months unknowingly, because she said they were to go to exhibitions with her sports team... Not to mention the amount of clothes, makeup and phone bills I had to pay. We took a flight together to see her family and spend 2 weeks with them in the middle of that affair for god's sake. That's the reason why this separation has been so painful, I felt horribly betrayed by my wife, this once wonderful, beautiful angel. Fortunately I've had time to rebuild my own self and to not feel sorry for myself anymore. Extra tip: running and weight training are amazing to overcome depression.


EDIT3: That being said, I still care about her, and only wish for her to be happy in her new life. She deserves it just as much as I do.

HOLY shit. 

he wanted me to come back to his apartment to chat, because he felt uncomfortable talking about all of this in public (understandable). so i went back with him, and we talked more. he even told me that he had had sexual encounters with guys in the past. *what the fuck?* how did i not know this?

after that, and about 6 more hours of talking, jake doesn't necessarily want to label his sexuality, but he still thinks of himself as ""straight,"" but again, he didn't want to put labels on it. 

now if you can imagine the look on my face during all of this, it was something along the lines of: mouth agape, eyes wide open. i have never in my life been on such an adrenaline rush. 

after Jake's realization, he then began asking me when my feelings started for him, etc. he told me that he did love me, and that i was always ""that guy"" for him... the one he could see himself with if all was possible, but that he's not comfortable with where he is and *who* he is at this point. i understood but i was REALLY fucking floored and confused at this point. and a little pissed he didn't tell me. i told him that, but he said it wasn't something he was ready to openly talk about. 

i left his place at about 7 this morning after talking for almost 12 straight hours. when i was going out the door, jake asked me if I'd at least kiss him goodnight. i laughed, thinking after everything, he was just teasing and yankin' my chain. but i just stood there, and jake kissed me on the cheek, then hugged me. there were tears from both of us and I told him that we would get him all sorted out, as it was causing him distress. 

we are meeting up tonight to go have a ""bro night"" (drinking, movies, dinner, etc) and just try to relieve some tension. i'm not sure what has happened or what *will* happen, but i am in no way going to pursue jake any further, because even though my feelings of love for him are still there, my hope and worry for his well-being are greater. and sorry for the poor grammar and shit...on my phone.

Sometimes I wish she just wasn't born, but at the same time, I can't imagine my life without her. Most beautiful, smiley little girl I've ever met in my life. She just started saying dada, and it makes me love her and makes me hate myself at the same time. I don't deserve to be her daddy. I don't know how to be better.

I mean, **imagine yourself posting your own confession**. You know what you're doing is wrong, and you already feel really guilty. Then you read all the replies: ""you are an asshole"", ""I hope you die"", ""you are a complete cunt"", ""just kill yourself"". 

All those replies do is make you feel like complete shit, right? And it even possibly discourages you from confessing to anyone again. There's a great, great line from the sidebar: ""**Confession is not supposed to be easy. But it is supposed to make you feel better.**""

He has ADHD and a host of other things, including a complete lack of social skills, oppositional defiant disorder, and an appalling lack of empathy. 

He lies, he steals our things, he invades our personal spaces, he defies me and his father at every turn, and all he seems to really care about is his Nintendo DS and screen time. Every single afternoon and evening end in fights, and I have deadbolt on my bedroom door and a safe in my room that I have to put my iPod and cell phone into every night or he will steal them and then lie about them until I search his room and find them, inevitably.

I almost constantly think of running away. You hear about it. Women and men who abandon their families and just leave. Or suicide -- I've thought about that, too. I could not do that to my husband and daughter. 

Before anyone asks or suggests -- yes, he's in therapy and he's on medication for his ADHD. We do family sessions with him and he blames his little sister for everything. When he was asked to draw his version of a happy family he drew her walking away from the house with a suitcase. No one had the guts to tell him that he should have drawn himself.

The therapy has helped him get along in school, but here at home... it's pretty hellish. I blame myself for everything. I feel like a terrible mother. I do not know how long we can do this. We were so happy once.

EDIT -- lots of people are talking about the DS. He doesn't get it often. Rarely during the week, which he has to earn, and for his Pokemon club on Sundays, which is at a local comic book store. Most of the kids don't bring card decks anymore.

**Second Edit** 
So much here. Thanks to those who have a real understanding of my son's issues and can see that there are real medical, neurological things at work. If anything, this thread has done two things:

1. It has made me feel the gut-reaction need to defend my son. That's a good feel. 
2. It has made me glad that he's got me for a mum -- someone who will try her hardest to recognize and understand him from the inside-out and do the work...the therapy, the medication. Whatever it takes.
3. Through PM, I've found some folks who really do get it. I'll get back to you all individually when I can. Thanks.

Sometimes confession is good for the soul, and sometimes we think we've reach our breaking point and...we haven't.

We'd hang out a lot, it seemed we were the best of friends. At the time he was engaged to the woman who is now his wife, who he married the year after I met them. Not long after they married, they had a child.

Flash forward years to about ~1.5 years ago and I'm living with my then girlfriend of 3 years. One day while we're together at home, she had to go out to, as she said ""get a few errands done"" and left her laptop on with web browser open. I figured I'd shut it down but go through the tabs and make sure she didn't have any unsaved work before I did. An email account was still logged in, in one of the tabs.

In it, I saw some mails with titles like ""miss you"" ""cant wait to see you again"" and ""do u like this?"" I went through them and confirmed that she was cheating on me. I found one where a guy had sent her pictures of his dick and naked body. Looking through the pictures, one of them had a face I noticed and recognized. The guy was Mark. That email chain also had her sending naked pictures of herself to him. I have no idea how long this had been going on, but the emails were over the span of a couple months and who knows if she ever deleted mail.

Now I had been cheated on a few times before by other girls but this time really struck a chord with me. This is the guy that I'd expect to have my back, not stick a knife into it. I can get over a woman cheating on me and move on after I dump her, but this time really fucked with my head, so I forwarded copies of the emails to my own address and cleaned up the evidence of what I did to decide what to do later, then turned off my girlfriend's laptop. When she got home about two hours later she noticed it was off and I just told her that she left it on and I didn't know when she was coming back so I turned it off. I can only guess where she went for those hours. Probably to get bent over by Mark I thought.

Before I found out I really had no reason to suspect it, and the next few days I acted like everything was normal and in my spare time alone I sort of stewed thinking about what to do about it. I didn't want to let this slide and didn't think just telling his wife and dumping my whore of a girlfriend was really enough for me this time because this was easily one of the worst betrayals in my life. 

After several hours of thinking I thought up a plan: I was going to fuck his wife or at least try to, and I was going to use the emails and pictures as proof to help me do it. His wife is pretty hot although I'd never have thought of trying to get with her before because I was just not that kind of guy and well, *best friend's wife* and all. Shit changed, though. I had never cheated on a girl before and never tried to get with any woman I knew was in a relationship, but now I had wanted to get revenge and had a new sort of morbid curiosity and desire to know what it's like to be on the other side of things after being cheated on several times.

Within the next two weeks on a day off I went to Mark's house the pretense of returning something borrowed on a day I'd knew he'd be at work, their child in school, and his wife who is able to be housewife thanks to how much money he earns would probably be at home. At the door I asked her if Mark was home (I knew he wasn't) and was told he wasn't so I handed her what I had borrowed explained about it, but then started some small talk about how she'd been lately and asked if I could use the bathroom. 20 seconds and one flush later I'm inside their house with her, continuing the smalltalk. She offered me a drink if I was thirsty so we went to the kitchen.

After I finished my drink I made it a bit personal and started asking how things were going between her and Mark these days. She seemed to think everything was great. I sort of it threw it out there that Mark seemed a bit off lately (though I hadn't actually noticed anything out of the ordinary before the email) and shrugged, turned around and got my phone out, opened one the saved e-mails and started reading them in a louder voice than normal and semi-sarcastic tone while I turned back around. She started looking at me funny and not saying a word while I was reading a few of those short exchanges so I brought up the mails with the pictures and asked if the guy in the pictures looks familiar and explained that I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with him, showing her my girlfriend's naked pictures she sent as well.

She seemed floored and started sobbing, so I hugged her and started holding her. When she calmed down a bit I looked into her eyes and then tried to kiss her. There was some resistance on the first few kisses, but I kept at it and soon she began kissing back and eventually we ended up going to their room and that was that. I had fucked his wife. I started contacting her days afterwards and this continued, I'd hang out with her and we'd do it regularly. Not too long later, like a month or so later we were going without protection. She was showing pregnant months later and I still kept seeing her. We didn't really discuss it much and I just kind of went with the flow.

I kept pretending everything was normal between Mark and I and my girlfriend and I even though I still wondered why he would do something like that, but things weren't really fine and eventually I just stopped caring to put in effort with the relationship with the girlfriend and we ended up breaking up. I guess his wife was pretending everything was normal too.

His wife gave birth earlier this year. The baby looks like has more of my features than his so it might be mine but who knows really with how babies look. No one can tell because babies don't really look like anyone. I'm still seeing her. She probably doesn't want to leave him because he makes a lot more than I do, which is probably what my ex girlfriend saw in him. I'm ok with not being part of the child's life even if it's mine because I can't really have a family without making a mess here, and I'm not really sure how I feel about his wife aside from the sex anyway. It's been great but I don't think there's much anything else beyond that.

I don't really feel proud about it, but I also don't feel too bad about it and think he deserves it. Obviously I don't think of myself as being as good of a person as I used to, but getting revenge this sweet sure made me feel pretty good. Am I the bad person, am I wrong here?

To be honest, they aren't my real friends, they're all superficial as fuck and I know they'd want to go to expensive places if they ever knew what I could afford.

I'm able to keep this such a good secret because I work a stable job and it looks like I can afford all the things I buy, even though I pretty much pay cash straight up, I bought a boat but my friends think it was from a bonus.

On this, the day before Thanksgiving, I keep thinking about how blessed I am with the life I now have. A loving family, a successful career, a beautiful wife who I love more than anything. At the same time I cringe during this time of year when I think back to the life I used to lead. All the names and locations in this confession have been fabricated but, with a nod to old memories not being one hundred percent reliable, what I shall confess here is true.

Also before I begin let me state that I am not proud of this period of my life. I'm absolutely ashamed about it.

***

Out of high school I went to work at a manufacturing plant that my father and his before him had both worked at their entire lives. I made pretty decent money and owned my first house when I was only 19 while most of my friends were working shitty jobs and living in small, shitty dorms at various universities. I thought of them as suckers at the time. But despite my decent pay it was never enough.

Enter James, a guy I only barely knewin high school. Like me he had a fake ID and frequented a very sleazy bar/strip joint just outside of our hometown. I didn't have many friends at that point cause most of them were away at university, improving their lives. I guess that's why I gravitated toward James. Eventually we started hanging out regularly. For a time I even let him live at my house.

One day James asked me if I'd like to make $400 cash. Who wouldn't? And all I had to do was drive a car of his from the city nearby to a city about four hours away. That was it. He'd even give me an extra $50 to buy a bus ticket home after. So I did it without many questions.

That's how it began. Every few weeks he'd ask me if I'd be willing to do it again. And though I knew something shady must be going on I figured what the hell? All I had to do was drive, drop the car off at a certain address, and then catch a bus back home. Easy money, no questions asked.

One day during one of the drives the car, which was a junker (they always were), got a flat. When I opened the trunk to get out the spare I saw a large black duffle bag-- the kind hikers use to pack up large tents. But I knew there was no tent inside. When I opened it I was only mildly surprised to see it filled with guns. 

I never mentioned the flat or my discovery of the guns to James. The money was too good and I didn't want to piss him off. But over time we just eventualy, and naturally, cut out all the bullshit. Stopped using code words. Stopped pretending I didn't know what I was doing.

About a year later I knew full well that I was transporting either guns or drugs (usually heroin or pot), and usually both, every other weekend. I asked for and received a raise: $600 a trip plus expenses. I never met the people on the other end during this time. I would just drop off the car at either a house or apartment complex in the other city then get the fuck out of there.

Meanwhile, back at home, James had become my best friend. He knew how to party. He knew everyone at the local bars and strip joints. He must have gotten me laid a dozen times. And I'm talking, with girls who were hot as fuck. I had serious girlfriends during this time, too, but whenever I had some kind of beef with James he'd show up at more door with some young hottie that barely spoke English. Some, I suspect, were no older than sixteen. But they were always very submissive and compliant and they always showed me a good time.

I knew in the back of my head that these girls were being mistreated. That they were prostitutes. That they were basically sex slaves. But I ignored all my reservations. I liked fucking them. And I treated them like shit because it made me feel good somehow.

Eventually James asked me to drive three girls to the other city and drop them off at a bar. They were ""transferring"" he told me. I agreed. During that drive one of them tried to escape during a stop at a rest area. She literally threw open the door and took off running as soon as I stopped the car. I chased her down, tackled her, and dragged her back to the car while she wailed in tears and blubbering things in Polish or Russian.

After that I still didn't stop. I ran the girls, too, but always bound their ankles together with twine before leaving. I ran them both ways, from my city to the other and back. I still ran the drugs and guns, too, and I made a lot of money in the process.

Everything began to finally change for me when James had me help him start recruiting locals. I know it's horrible but the foreign girls were easy to ignore since I never really understood them. Only one in three ever knew much English and even then they were usually quiet. But local girls? They weighed on my conscience. I suddenly saw them as human. One in particular begged me to bring her home and she was as young as my little sister. So I did. I brought her home. 

The scariest moment of my life was when James showed up at my house after that. He was furious and he was carrying as always. He actually drew his piece on me. I don't know how but somehow I talked him down from murdering me right then and there.

I did a few more runs for him after that but no women/girls. Eventualy I got lucky: the plant I worked at had ordered increased production. Seven day work weeks. James knew he couldn't pay me enough to make up for me quitting that job so he accepted the fact I know longer could be one of his runners. After a few months he stopped even asking me.

I got my shit together during that time. I became very religious as the guilt for what I had done consumed me. I remain religious to this day though not so much as back then.

Eventually I ended up becoming one of the ""suckers"" I used to sneer at. I went back to school. I got a degree and have been working in my field of study ever since. No idea why I got so lucky. Had I been pulled over once in any of those drives I would have been fucked.

Those days will forever haunt my nightmares. When I think of those poor girls, especially. My own daughters are older than some of the ones I essentially raped back then. To this day, too, whenever I read about a shooting in that city I brought so many guns to I wonder if possibly one of the weapons had been delivered there by me. The drug overdoses, too, the lives ruined by the drugs. Jesus help me.

I didn't mean for this to happen. 

I noticed the obvious stares, and the smilies (which I returned), the flirting and him getting a little handy. I never stopped him, hell I liked the attention. It was flattering that a powerful, successful man would be attracted to a slightly awkward, silly girl straight out of college. When you spend 10 hours a day working with the same person, and you chat to him about everything, and you work so hard you don't have time for a proper social life, your defences start to crack.

It was just once. One crazy night after a week of the hardest work both of us have ever had to do on a particularly complex set of contracts. He bought expensive champagne and we sat on the couch in his office and drank it until we got giddy. Then he kissed me, and I kissed back. 30 minutes later it was all over, and we were putting our clothes back on.

""Let's not read too much in to this"" he said. ""I love my wife"".

A few weeks later I missed my period, and got a pregnancy test. It was positive. I was scared, angry (at him and at myself for being so stupid), uncertain about what to do.

I went in screaming but he was surprisingly cool about it. We've come to an arrangement. I'm keeping it. He's paying me $1000 per month to help out as long as I never say a word to anyone about whose kid it is. As far as anyone's concerned, it was a stupid one night stand. Actually, I'm not lying about that. What I am lying about is not knowing who he was. 

My parents aren't pleased. My sister is more understanding although she can't understand why her sister-who-tells-her-everything won't say a word about who her babydaddy is. 

The world keeps on turning. In 3 months I'll have new priorities (my due date is July). And I'm pretty sure I'll get all the maternity time I'll need, thanks to her daddy being the boss.

He often used me in every hole and would strike and threaten me afterward or pull my hair or tie me so that I couldnt leave. 

I struggled and cried first, then for two whole years I was suicidal and cut myself, I then I got used to it. I let it happen. After that wonderful period of my life he got thrown out of school for drugs, became a homeless heroin addict and is now in jail. He sends me letters often like nothing ever happened. 

It screwed me up so bad. I feel nothing but guilt because I could have so easy put a stop to it, but I know our dad would have killed him or hed be locked up in jail for his entire life. I did not want that. I just wanted him to stop. 

He always told me that if I had a real boyfriend he would kill me and him, and since then I have never been able to have a relationship because of it, and I was so used to getting raped that was all i knew so I almost feel its kind of consensual? Its screwed up.

We ended up getting naked, and the four of us crammed into a shower together to wash each other and enjoy the experience while tripping balls.

Everyone ended up making out... Even my brother and I. We confessed that we had always had crushes on each other since we were children. We made out for quite a few minutes, and our other friends left the shower and left us alone. He even sucked on my breasts for a few minutes, until I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said we had done enough.

Later on that night, we discussed what we learned. My brother said he learned that incest is not a bad thing - but a beautiful thing that society only deems wrong. I did not feel that same.

He ended up telling me a few weeks later that he had strong feelings for me, of a sexual and romantic nature. I felt incredibly uncomfortable around him. I felt disgusting, ashamed, dirty, and like I was a terrible person. It probably, to this day, remains to be my absolute worst mistake, and biggest regret.

I have read other confessions about siblings being sexual together, and even falling in love. My response is generally, ""Aww, that's cool for them. Must be difficult though. But I wish them luck."" But when I think of my brother and I, I feel ill, and get the worst wave of icky all over me. I feel horrible about it.

I ended up telling my brother that what happened between us, from my perspective, was simply an experience on a drug. That I always loved him, as my brother, and had admitted that he was physically attractive, but that I had no interest in ever being with him romantically. I think it really hurt him, and our bond has never been the same. It's awkward when we hang out alone or with friends.

I haven't told anyone but my mom, who also had experiences of incest when she was growing up - but hers were not concentual. She doesn't judge me, and I don't think my brother knows that she knows. But whenever I think about it, I feel disgusting and dirty. I wonder how I will ever marry someone if I have to hide such a gross experience from them, and I would never want to share this story with anyone, because I am afraid they would secretly judge me and never love me.

TLDR; made out with my brother and he sucked my boobies while on E. He told me he loved me and had sexual feelings, but I did not feel the same. I have felt terrible and disgusting ever since that experience, and I fear it will continue to negatively affect my life forever.

I was living in new york city at the time. We agreed to meet in central park on a rainy day. I was really afraid of being attacked because the other guy was a complete stranger. He told me he had been drinking liquids and needed to pee bad. We went to a secluded area and he told me to get on my knees. He then pulled out his penis and peed on me for what seemed like forever. He actually made a point to pee all over my clothes. After he was finished it was kind of awkward, i didn't know what to say, so i just said thank you. He was like, no problem. As I was walking away the clothes started to dry and kind of burn and obviously smelled real bad. I only did this one time and was really paranoid I was going to see the other guy in a social setting.

Edit- Really surpised at how many upvotes that I received.  I have never told anyone this confession for obvious reasons. People have been far more understanding than I expected. I actually don't think that I would have the courage to meet a stranger and get peed on in public again. Some of the insults people have left don't bother me at all.

In reality, we met in a sex chatroom.  This was a particularly dark period of my life filled with depression and loneliness.

Anyway, the first time we ever chatted involved myself jerking off on skype for her.  We had cyber and phone sex for a few weeks and slowly our conversations started turning to talking about other things and we started a long distance relationship (~400 miles).  The long-distance lasted about 2 years and I took the plunge and moved to her state.  About a year and a half later we got engaged.

I love her so much and I've never been happier.  But it kills me that I have to lie to my friends and family about how we met.

 I am white 17 year-old. I have a few friends. I have a history of depression. I attempted suicide one, whatever. But to put it in a cliche: my relationship with everyone is a roller-coaster. I never retain relationships. This is speaking platonically of course, because a sexual relationship for me is about as likely as Sarah Palin becoming the head of MENSA. I am blunt. I am brutally honest. I am a dick and I hate pretty much everything.

I have very little friends. I am horny but could never get a girlfriend. I am depressed. I am lonely.

I have a 10 year-old adopted black brother with recently diagnosed ADHD who constantly vandalizes my possessions, we hate each other. Last weekend he had a full-blown, 10/10, fucking tantrum and ruined my gaming pc and peripherals and everything he used to play game on. Because of this my parents have taken it away.

I was upset by this, ""I am being punished because my brother broke *my* stuff"" I thought to myself. I dislike being around my family. I really want to be individual without having to work for anything. So at dinner tonight I just kind ranted at my family and had a full-blown, 10/10, fucking tantrum.

We had a lot in common and just clicked in a way I had never felt before.  She made a huge impression on me.  I never asked her for her number (mainly due to my own shyness and awkardness).  I kicked myself about that for a very long time, and (unlike today with facebook, etc) I couldn't just plug her name into a search engine and find her.  In fact, I didn't even remember her surname until I read it somewhere many months later, at which point I figured calling her up would have been weird.  Years later I did have an opportunity to put myself in a position where I could meet her again, but it was at the same time (literally the same week!) where I proposed to my wife and figured I didn't want to screw up a perfectly good thing on what was a 2 hour meeting years before, so I decided to not pursue it.

About 10 years ago I looked her up on the net.  I found she was active on the net (facebook wasn't around yet, but there were other social sites before then), and I followed her life since , from a breakup in a LTR through to marriage (and her married name actually makes it easier to find her on the net!) and 3 kids.  She seems happy in her life.  The scary thing is how many 2nd and 3rd-degree connections we have  - in a way it is amazing our paths have never crossed again!

I have a very happy life with a wife and family of my own and would not give that up for anything.  Still, I follow this girl's (woman's) life online.  Why? I don't really know.  Somehow it is comforting to know she ended up happy.  I don't want to change the way things are or architect a 'chance meeting' (or do anything that would put my current relationship at risk, it is just comforting to know she is out there living her life and I am living my own.

I don't regret the life I have, but I do wonder how different my life would have been had I had the courage just to ask for her number.  Not just her and me together, but the limitless number of other inflexion points in my life that could have stemmed from a different action that day.  Logically, the chances are things would have turned out the same way (and even more likely is that a relationship would never have eventuated from it, much less a life together), yet still I wonder....

The one thing I would desperately love to know is whether I made any sort of impression on her or whether she even remembered me beyond that afternoon.  It was a stand-out even for me, I do wonder if she ever thought of me again.  In my mind, if she did it would somehow justify my still thinking about her now.

Fellow redditors, I am sure I am not alone here, please share your stories!

I know indesign and illustrator and I can work a bash shell if I need, otherwise it's pure pixel pushing and enough smarts to keep my machines running or recognise faults. I'm not a windows user or tech but I have a big family and even bigger extended family.

I used to try fixing family machines when asked  because I saw how much distress my family were in when they couldn't talk to friends or print pictures or whatever. Doesn't take much to get tired of getting nothing but a cup of coffee and asked to ""see if you can get it to print anyway"" when print cartridges are obviously used up, or trying to get a Pentium 4 loaded down with so much malware it takes 30 minutes to boot, to play pirated mkv blu rays in a codec whatever player they have doesn't understand. I got tired of losing a whole day many weekends and more than enough weeknights just because im single, driving to people's houses to find out they still didn't replace the printer cartridges or pay their Internet provider, and then get berated with ""well surely there's something else you can try"" like I'm being lazy. More hours lost, no compensation, it got to me.

So now I just break shit so badly so they can't sit over my shoulder and tell me they got on the internet last time and it worked, and they grab the mouse and double click on an eBay shortcut and get an ISP error to contact accounts to regain web access, s they go through every fucking bookmark and it says the same thing and I'm jack of not being listened to.

So I have a Linux boot cd and I nuke their OS enough that machines just don't boot. One of my cousins called me back to help with typing up an assignment and I explained I'm not a typist, and my uncle got on my case and my parents about it being important for his study, and I get there and their fucking dell still doesn't boot because they didn't want to go get it properly fixed, or even try reinstalling themselves. So I nuked the entire drive. 

And I'm enjoying this.

I know it's wrong, but I'm getting an immense pleasure from inconveniencing self centred morons whso expect free tech fixes just because I can read instructions and a prompt. My stepbrother wanted me to buy an antivirus for his laptop. He knew which one he wanted, he had his card out, but he wanted me to put the payment through. Screw being responsible for that if he or I had picked a spammy site to buy through, I nuked his machine before being pushed into that. Told him because his antivirus ran out he must have been hacked and his credit card might be with Russians now.

I hope I get a reputation for being clueless with computers. I need my time to myself, I'm tired of being taken for granted. I realise I could just say no, or charge for it, but there are whole levels of other crap to wade through in my family that that would just exacerbate. I guess I also disappoint myself for not standing up and saying no, or not developing the communication skills to really get across that I don't know what I'm doing enough to do this efficiently and that its wasting my and their time but real techs with the same problem seem to say the same things so I don't know.

I wish I were a better person about this.

Edit: thanks for your advice, everybody. I'm being a cock about this and it's not right and I think you've shown me its probably not helpful in the end. There's a few comments about charging family, and I hinted at that myself but really I despise screwing about with computers even if I was paid well for it.

So I decided to get my life on track and get socializing mainly.

So there was this girl in high school (6 years ago.) that I used to like quite alot. I messaged her on facebook that I had a freelance work for her.

She said cool, she'd do it. 

I gave her some made up brief and she delivered with some shitty work.

So I  told her that her cheque is ready.. where would you like to take it? 

We met at a pub, so that I could give her the cheque.. (my own money for nothing)..

We started talking.. and now we're going out.

I want to start by at least attempting to prove that I am not some far-right tinfoil hat wearing Alex Jones listener. So, a little about me...

I live in the mid-west. 
I'm in my early thirties. 
I'm a single father. 
I have a decent job that I greatly enjoy. I spend my days at work dreaming up ways to help the environment, and working to put those ideas into action. 
I recycle as often as possible. 
I love coffee and craft beer. 
I go out on dates occasionally, but not as often as I'd like. 
I have two dogs that I absolutely adore. 
I like to go for long bike rides with my child in the evenings. 
I love taking my child to museums, and encourage him/her to learn about science as much as possible. 
I took my child to see The Hobbit last December. We both dressed in costume for the occasion, and it was one of the most fun nights we've ever had. 
My child and I are both massive fans of Doctor Who, and we're planning on attending the next sci-fi convention within driving distance. 
I support equal rights.
I'd love to march in a gay pride parade to support my gay friends.
I'm an atheist.
I voted for Gary Johnson in the last election. I considered voting for Obama, but I didn't feel that he represented my views. 
I own a gun. It's a Remington 870 Wingmaster 12 gauge shotgun that I inherited from my late Grandmother. She kept it when my Grandfather died in the 1980's, and I doubt it's been fired since. I certainly haven't used it. 

I say these things in the hope of conveying that I am, for all intents and purposes, just a normal guy. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm not an end-times evangelical christian nutjob. I'm a tax-paying, community minded, fairly liberal, normal dude. That being said...

I just don't see an alternative to government overthrow. By force, if needed. With the recent revelations about the NSA, the controversy surrounding Edward Snowden, the remarks defending NSA surveillance by officials like President Obama and Nancy Pelosi, the wholesale robbery of American taxpayers by the mega-banks and massive multinational corporations...

I just don't see how petitions and voting are going to change anything. If I've learned anything in my life, it's that once power is seized it's not likely to be willingly returned. I don't see the logic in ""asking"" our elected officials to ""Please not spy on us!""

What prisoner was ever successful in ""asking"" to be set free? What slave was ever successful in ""asking"" his master to stop lashing them?

Maybe I'm wrong. I certainly could be. Maybe I'm just jaded. But I honestly don't see how things will get any better, unless we start getting serious with these bastards. Even the thought that this post could be used against me somehow makes my blood boil.



Anyway, that's my take. I'd like to hear yours.
Cheers.

Decided I was going to surprise my good female friend at her house for her birthday, maybe bring over some of our mutual friends and some drinks. It was around 10PM or so, so I head over to her house. Turns out she had already left to go partying with some of her friends. I texted the set of mutual friends that were not currently partying with her but that I had invited to come over. I was like ""yeah let's just meet her at X club."" 

Well, I didn't want to be rude to her mom, who had answered the door and had invited me in for a quick chat. She could tell I was slightly buzzed, as I had pregamed beforehand. She offers me a drink before I go, so I drink with her, then we get sidetracked talking about alcohol. The TV had a comedy routine playing in the background that was really funny, so mom and I get distracted, share tons of laughs and continue drinking. 

She is really touchy with me, but I just go with it. Suddenly she kisses me (this is about after 45 minutes of us being together), and I let her. I am pretty passive about the whole thing and then start getting aroused. Then I go all out and start feeling up the mom. 

Things ended well. She was very good at sexual activities. Mom and I sleep together on the couch. It got very awkward when my friend came back at around 3 AM that night and saw us two together. 

UPDATE:

So I met up with my friend to get some coffee, and presumably talk about what happened. She started off by saying that her dad and her mom have been going through a rough stretch and that she appreciated that I finally stopped being evasive. She had been trying to talk to her mom, but her mom was being evasive, as I was earlier.
My friend was pretty calm, but slightly unstable. She asked me why I slept with her mom and didn't come join her at the bar to celebrate her birthday. I told her that I had gone to her house with the intention of surprising her, but she didn't seem to believe it. After a while, she said ""I'm tired of pretending to be calm"" then she started to slap at me and took her heavy book and tried to hit me.
I calmed her down by hugging her tightly. Then I told her that I am sorry for the events that transpired and that I was only vaguely aware that her mom and dad were going through a rough stretch. I told her that her mom had initiated the kissing, but that I had initiated the sexy times. She got super pissed but refrained from hitting me. She left the coffee place and I tried chasing after her but she wouldn't have it.

We mostly did shows in very small venues like coffee shops, all ages clubs, and any festival that would take us. Our crowning achievement was a gig at the Warped Tour (one short set). We weren't very successful and never got beyond self published CDs. No label ever signed us and looking back I cringe at the shitty music we produced.

That didn't stop me from being sort of a local celebrity. In a small pond even a tiny fish can be a whale and my town was small enough to qualify. I was written about several times in local newspapers and practically everybody thought I was going to be the next Billy Joe Armstrong or Trent Reznor. Nevermind the fact I was an unemployed loser still living at his parents house who smoked way too much weed, drank way too much rum, and was delusional enough to think these habits helped my ""art"". Fun fact? I couldn't even read music. I still can't. But I knew enough about the guitar to make it appear I knew what I was doing onstage. People bought it.

Especially girls. Especially young girls. Most of our fans were teenage girls who were easily manipulated into thinking we were superstars. Me and the guys thought we deserved the adoration and had no qualms about cashing in whenever possible. We thought it was funny how easy these girls were to take advantage of and we used them maliciously as a result. All these years later, trust me, I am not proud of how we treated them. We were total assholes to them.

Eventually a couple members of the band realized that we weren't going anywhere and they quit. I refused to accept the fact we weren't going to make it because at the time I felt like I had no other options in life. So I recruited new band members and began doing shows for free just to get our name out there. It was all futile of course.

And then my car quit on me. I still remember that day like it happened yesterday. I was just driving along and suddenly it just stopped after a lot popping sound from the front. Turns out the engine threw a rod. I called a buddy of mine from a nearby payphone and he came straight away to give it a look. He just shook his head and told me the brutal truth: the car was fucked.

That very same night I was at a bar, downing my sorrows with what was left of my meager amount of savings, when this guy came up to me and said he knew who I was. He also knew the girl I was currently seeing-- a sixteen year old hot piece of ass named Michelle. This girl was dumber than a street lamp. I remember telling Derrick that exact line. As a joke.

Derrick took that joke seriously. He told me that if I needed money for a new car I could use Michelle to get it. 

That's how it all started. With Derrick's help I managed to convince Michelle to prostitute herself to help me fund my band. Derrick introduced her to heroin (something I never got into) and before long she was practically living with him. And working for him. I got 50% of every job she completed so I wasn't complaining. 

It didn't stop there. I started calling and recruiting full time. Derrick taught me how to do it and I was an eager student. I'd say that all told I successfully got twenty young women to work for us, most of whom were between the ages of sixteen and twenty. These were all girls who trusted me and loved me because of my band. A band that was practically non-existant at that point.

I got busted eventually for fucking a fourteen year old. Did my time in prison and while there realized how fucked up I was. Now all these years later I look back on those earlier days and feel sick.

I just wanted to say we're truly sorry for not being able to accomodate you within our group. I know you wanted to experience the Walking Dead maze, but when we said we've already went through it, we really meant it and our girlfriends were scared shitless the first time through, lol. We don't want you to think we just said that so you would leave us alone (you're not a creeper, so you don't have to apologize for asking!), and as soon as you left we felt our hearts sink because we should've invited you in our group anyways. Nobody should be alone on Halloween night at the Haunt, and we all thought that it was really unfortunate that your friends had to leave early for whatever reason.

It struck me in particular because I felt a connection with you-- I used to be the guy that wanted to stay until the very end but my other friends always had other obligations. I was always left behind. I was the guy who wanted to ride that attraction that's best experienced in a group who unfortunately didn't have a group and I didn't want to society to look at me like I'm a loser who rides on all the rides alone. So I'd just go home.

Unlike you, I didn't have the guts to ask anyone else if I could join them for the rest of the day/night. That struck me because you had the courage that I never had, and the one chance that I could've helped someone in a similar situation that I've experienced before is the one chance that I blew. There's no, ""Today, you. Tomorrow, me."" I screwed that shit up. And if I could turn back time and say, ""Yeah bro, you can join us, no problem, but we might not do a maze."" I'd do it in a heartbeat.

Of course, your situation could totally be different than mine. Who knows, I might be sympathizing for absolutely no reason and you might not even relate to what I went through. I don't want to stereotype, but I'll say, the look of courage I saw in your eyes when you asked us as we cold-heartedly turned you down gave me the impression that I was a douche bag when I saw the defeat in your stare right after. We should've left YOU with the decision whether you wanted to join us wherever we went rather than shutting you out completely, because we're human beings like that.

Regardless, whoever you are, I hope that you were able to make it to the line for the Walking Dead maze. It was one hell of an attraction! I know we had only 5-10 minutes before the park closed, but I saw you running after looking at your phone, so I assume it was to the maze queue. If you didn't make it or decided not to go, I'm sorry :/. If that's the case and for some reason you run across this, hit me up and we'll go next year if you want to give us another chance. We really hope you enjoyed the rest of your night, because I know that we reevaluated ourselves after ours. Next time, we definitely know better.

TL;DR - We're sorry we were douchebags for denying you from joining our group when yours left early during Halloween Horror Night, but we commend you for the courage you had for even asking us in the first place and we'd invite you if we could turn back time (or see you in the future!)",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_12gb8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/12gb8b/to_the_guy_at_halloween_horror_night_la_whose/,

So, a few months ago, Mom decides to cancel Christmas plans out of the blue because, ""her and Ted are getting divorced"".

She had just gotten back from a trip to Florida with ""the girls"" (a bunch of rich, divorced, middle-aged type bitches).

Normally, I wouldn't give a shit, but what catches my eye is the guy signing off with ""XOXO"" and I'm thinking that's pretty fucking weird for a professional email.

Patrick's day we were in the lab doing some cell culturing and as anyone who has  done this knows there are some substantial wait times involved. (This was a 5 hour lab).

We started a cell culture and finished up with our notes but didnt have to be back in the lab for about 2.5 hours to do the rest of the lab so my lab partner and I decided to go to the campus bar. Well I drank two pitchers of green beer and headed back to the lab. 

I walked in a little tipsy (I'm 6'5"" and 240lbs) and I see the prof reading a book over her lab table. I walked up to her and started flirting. My lab partner tried to pull me away...I guess worried she would be upset we were drinking or something.

We went to the bar and she bought us a few drinks and then we cabbed back to her place. Had sex. Woke up the next morning to people eating breakfast. Her family decided to come over to visit I guess. Went into the dining room and sat down. People were extremely confused about who the hell I was until she walked into the room and kissed me...everyone looked really awkward, but meh what do I care.

But the actual story is quite a bit longer.

I did a tour in the US Army, and while in service i busted two vertebrae and had some serious nerve damage. Suffice to say, i was discharged. 

Fast forward past two years of drinking and being seriously depressed.

Im out of money, no job, and generally doing shit with my life. Met a group of seriously cool ""modern hippies"" wiccans, alternate lifestylers etc. Make friends with a bunch of them. There is this one chic there, that just hates my guts. Cant stand me. Says im to polite, that im to nice. Always says some nasty shit to me, etc.

Few months pass, and i hook up casually with some of the chicks in this group, and start feeling like im fitting in, still seriously depressed, still drinking, but generaly coming out of the nose dive. Get a job, get place, doing pretty well. Start being friends with the mean chick. Find out shes rather cool. Older than me a bit, previously married, but im cool. Shes got a great kid, and i like him.

Start sleeping with her. Not cause i really felt anything, just sex, you know?

Couple months pass, and the place im working at, closes. No job, no money, no place...no where to go. Chick asks me to move in. I do, figure since i fuck her, i could sleep over, right?

Not a bad deal realy. Have some money from disability from the army, help her pay off her place with a VA loan. Shes really greatfull.

Month later, come in from hangin with some guys, and find her crying on the couch. Cant figure out why, after long conversation, she confesses shes in love with me. I have no idea what to say..so i just say i love her to.

Fast forward 3 years. 

Things have been shitty financially, on and off jobs, shitty little town, lots of stress, lots of fighting. My now wife is starting to get seriously bitchy, saying some realy nasty shit. I dont like arguing, but its getting to the point where i feel like shes actually goading me into hitting her. I finaly have enough, and make plans to leave her. Find out shes pregnant. My heart sinks. Do the right thing and stay with her.

Things get better for a while, we buy a house, i open a business, have a beautiful baby boy, i even take some classes at the local college. Come to love her son as my own flesh and blood. Am actually doing pretty well emotionally. Stressed a bit, not really happy, but generally ok.

The recession hits. My business tanks. Shes a nurse, we manage to stay afloat for about 6 months...and then suddenly no money, at all (this is seriously important, but i didnt figure it out till later). We lose the house, one of the cars, and have no where to g0. Family takes us in, and we move to Texas.

Texas. Living in a converted garage, no car (it broke down, sold it for parts, had no choice) Working for relatives. Every time i turn around, wife has spent the check on something we dont need. Some decorations, furniture we dont have room for. Watches, jewelry. Etc.

I finaly get contacted by some crediters..find out i have a ton of debt. 56k of debt. Find out the wife had opened up credit cards in my name, other services, extra cable, bank accounts, etc. Also found out she had been stealing my business money when it was running.

So..heres the picture.

We are living in a one bedroom+den apartment. Barely making it week to week. Im out of a job (random contracts with my families business, but not steady work), one car, seriously depressed, seriously unhappy, and start thinking about ending it all. We dont really go out, and honestly, i haven't done anything fun, other than run to the store or a late night beer run for a couple years.

Ive played MMOs pretty much constantly, switching from one to the other, on a whim. Heard about a good one Age of Conan, so i try it out. Get into the RP scene, and start having some serious fun. Other than my children, pretty much the only thing i had to go on.

While in game, get into some serious Rp story-lines with another Rper. Start talking OOC, get to know each other very very well. Shes married, having similar marriage issues as i. We have alot of common interests, and realy seem to get along. We end up talking for 3-4 hours a time, longer on weekends. I start having some feelings for this person. And seriously not knowing how to deal with it.

Like those fluttery bouncy feelings. And seriously, i have no fucking clue what to do with them. Hell, until well later, i thought i was having small heart attacks, or something.

Emotionally, i sky rocket out of my depression. I start listening to music, want to dance, and generally am more up beat. I start wanting to go out, to go to bars, or play pool or something.

Wife notices, and we get into a HUGE fight. Fight summary? She is weirded out by my happiness. It makes her skin crawl. Two weeks of constant hell, and bitching on her part. Every day fighting.

Week or so later, the person i met online asks me to meet her. Im like...fuck, i cant stand whats going on right now, im gonna rip some ones head off, i could use a vacations. Sure. (Note: I had no idea on what feelings i had for this girl, im not exactly what you would call emotionally self aware.)

So, i drive three hours to meet this chick at her families ranch house. So, we have a nice private little meal, talk about shit..and get into nature right? Walk in the woods. And i feel seriously at peace. All my pressers, and shit just slide off. Happy as could be.

Night comes, and we are inside, still talking, we get tired, and there is futon. We both kind of lay down, and cuddle up. One thing lead to another, and im balls deep. And not caring a damn.

The weekend is god damn awesome. Never felt like that with anyone. Everything is absolutely perfect. I dont even feel any guilt about cheating. Time comes, and i have to go home.

Apparently i was out of service range for my cell, start getting serious text message spam on the drive back. Lots of mean nasty shit from the wife, and at the end, find out shes sent my stuff over to my moms, and is kicking me out.

Im like....*shrug* Meh, i dont give a shit.

Next two weeks are crazy. Couch surfing at my moms. Doint say anything about my weekend, dont tell anything to anyone. Wife calling to bitch me out. She decided to go out, she comes back, and tells me she fucked a guy. Im not even sure i care. 

Huge fight, and at the end of it, i told her if she didnt like me being so happy, to bad. I was going to be happy with her or without her.

She goes out with two separate other dudes, and fucks them. Im done. 

I decide to move 400 miles a way and give it a shot with this other woman.

Takes me a month of doing shitty jobs to save enough money, but i get there. Happy as fuck, even tho im in a shitty ghetto apartment. One room. One totally room (plus bathroom, which is tiny) Never knew they even existed before this.

The woman ends up leaving her husband for me, and we live in this shitty little apartment for six months, before finally upgrading to a one bedroom.
Happiest fucking time of my life. Never felt this kind of stuff before. Compared to any other time in my life, never even knew the definition of happy till then.

Rough divorce for both her and me. Her parents loath me, thinking im the reason their marriage broke up.

Fast forward three years.

Im remarried, have another child. Amicable between ex and i. See my kids regularly. 150+k home, Tech job, two cars, and have never been more happy in my life.

Note: Only one kid from the first marriage is mine. Other one is my stepson, but i consider him mine. I raised him from when he was 1.

Note2: I had no intention of cheating on the wife, my intention was simply to get away for the weekend and meet someone who (at that point in my mind) was nothing more than a really good friend or confidant.

I was waiting to fall head over heels or for a knight in shining something. But I started to have visions of myself older; 40 or 50, still waiting for that perfect guy. Having no interest in waiting around forever, I decided to just get find a way to get married as soon as possible. I started dating someone I met online. I couldn’t really even stand him. He was awkward and nerdy and not in an endearing way, potentially somewhere on the autism spectrum, but crazy about me (yay?). I did enjoy his company to a certain extent, but there was zero physical attraction, and the bad far outweighed the good. But he kept wanting to see me, so I kept seeing him. He asked me to be his girlfriend and told me he loved me. I said yes, and I love you too. 6 months in he asked me to move in with him and started talking marriage. I giddily agreed. He moved in with me since I owned my house, and 2 months later we were engaged. I took him to meet my family and we planned our lives together, even naming our unborn children. I was on cloud nine at the prospect of getting married, all the while I could not stand this guy. It started to show. He called me out on it. I freaked out, panicked that he was going to leave me, and started working on a better cover for our relationship. We went on a vacation to a place he wanted to go, that held no interest for me. I hated it but faked happiness to try to keep tricking him into marrying me. I just wanted to make it legal. Get married, have kids, and focus on them and not this loser. He made good money and was from a good family, and I just needed someone to take care of me. Someone who would let me stay home and raise kids, and someone that I knew couldn’t do better than me. As our wedding got closer, the facade started to crack. I hated the way he ate, the way he talked, the jokes he told, the way he dressed, he was awful in bed and I started to actually dread sex with him. We’d been together a year and I was already so sick of him, I questioned how I’d get through the night, let alone the rest of my life. I got meaner and meaner, as people do when they are unhappy. However, I let everyone around me believe we were deliriously happy. I cluttered my Facebook with pictures of us, and gushy status updates about how happy he made me. 

Finally one night, he had enough. He cried and said he wanted to make me happy but he just couldn’t, and he knew it. He knew that we would never be happy together and he had to end it. I panicked, not because I was losing him but because I was now no longer engaged. I had to take off my diamond. I had to re-join the ranks of the single girls. I begged and pleaded, not because I loved him, but because I loved the idea of being a married woman. My friends and family to this day think he’s the biggest ass hole in the world because as far as they knew, we were a ridiculously happy couple moving toward marriage one day, and he was callously calling it off the next. No one knows that I never loved him, was never attracted to him, and that I was almost embarrassed to be with him. No one would suspect I was just desperate to get married to anyone - literally. A year later I’m still riding on the sympathy of the break up. People still commiserate with me over my broken heart. I talk about how I have no ability to trust now, since this man who was supposed to love me more than anyone proposed to me and then took it back, out of the blue! I did nothing! I’m such an angel. 

I do honestly think he’s gay, but that’s unrelated to why he dumped me. He dumped me because he knew he deserved better. He knew I barely liked him, even if I said 100 times a day how much I loved him. I’m so proud of him for dumping me. If he stays single for the rest of his life, he’s better off.

I am vocal about the fight for equality, and have driven away most of my family because of this.  I don't care.  I have devoted my life to this cause, and spend many waking hours both at work and at home doing what I can to support those who need it.

It is my penance.

You see, I wasn't always like this.  I was raised an evangelical, and taught that homosexuality was a choice and a sin.  Though they preached to love the sinner and hate the sin, those ideas are difficult to separate.  I hated both.

There was a gay kid at my high school.  His name was Scott, but I only ever called him 'faggot' unless a teacher was around, and told him that he'd burn in hell for being a cocksucker.  I was *horrible* to him, and everyone else laughed and cheered me on. 

I had been bullied in middle school and freshman year of high school, so the feeling of the jocks cheering me on was exhilarating.  I loved it, and so I hated him.

Shortly after we graduated, he swallowed a handgun.  Sure, there was other shit in his life, and sure I never actually did anything other than say hateful words, and sure I wasn't even the only one who did it, or the loudest, or the most common.  I still did it.  *I made him kill himself.*  I have blood on my hands.

I have spent the last ten years coming to terms with it.  I tried to blame others, but there's this thing with having blood on your hands: it doesn't come off, no matter how many excuses you try to use as soap.  Nothing will ever change the fact that he killed himself, and if I had shown him kindness instead of hatred, I could have saved him instead of killing him.  I am a fucking monster.

LGBT community, I am *so fucking sorry* for denying you the chance to know this wonderful kid.  I've never told anyone I know, for fear that they wouldn't trust me anymore, wouldn't let me volunteer anymore, wouldn't let me fight anymore.   I can't let that happen.  I see his face every day, and I have to fight for him.  I have to make this right.  I can't live with myself otherwise.

Please forgive me.

Edit: Thank you, all of you.  It was hard to write this, but I'm starting to feel a little more closure now.

I was always they type who never thought it could happen to me, but he didn't start being that way.  The control and drug use and lack of work was a gradual slide.  He convinced me that I didn't deserve any better than him until one day I just woke up.  ""What the fuck am I doing?  Life is too short.""  I was so happy to be back with my friends and family after having been very isolated with him.  I remembered how much I missed them and knowing that I was honestly cared for, not just what I could do for them.

I finally felt free!  It was a fresh start, without my oppressive, abusive ex-bf.  I started taking classes, got a part time job, and then my period was late.  When I told my mother, she was more than happy about having a grandchild, but was worried about my ex.  She asked me if he treated me the way he did without a second thought, how would he treat a helpless baby?  I decided she was right, and it wasn't worth chancing my baby's safety or happiness.  I decided to be a single mom and never tell the biological father.  My baby has grown up in a loving, happy family with no abuse, unless you count the occasional raised voice. 

My husband and I met when my baby was little and he is the only father the kid has ever known.  We also had another baby a few years later and we all have the same last name.  We live out in the country in a nice little neighborhood.  It isn't affluent by any means, but the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else.  They have a good school and friends and family close by.  We do the best we can.  However, I am always worried about making the right decisions when it comes to parenting, and looked up my ex online.  In the years since I left him, he has been arrested 9 times, and a couple more times under his brother's name!  Apparently, he used his brother's (another criminal as well) SSN and name to avoided being picked up on other charges, most of which stemmed from cocaine possession.  Over, and over, and over.  It was a big reason I left him to begin with.  

My confession is that I am glad to see he got arrested.  I don't like his choices or his suffering, but it comforts me to know that I did make the right choice when it came to letting him know about the baby.  He would have only brought that child misery.  Some might argue that the kid could have given him a reason to do better, but I didn't feel like she should be a guinea pig for his behavior.

I consider myself sane and generally down to earth, but this guy. He was so perfect. We were coworkers, and every day I looked forward to taking our break together, and I'd mentally catalog each time we brushed or I made him laugh.

Eventually I told him how I felt. He was amicable to the idea. We tried it out a few weeks, slept together, then broke it off. I was oddly calm about this, I wasn't even surprised that he wanted to break it off. The chemistry was admittedly weird outside of work. 

I still wanted him, though.

Unsurprisingly, after our failed fling he started avoiding me at work. Within a month he had moved to another department, and then to another building.

Still calm, I acknowledged the fact that he did not want to be around me.

Still calm, I acknowledged the fact that what he wanted didn't affect the situation at all if I just decided to . . . keep him.

It was such a strange thought that I just left it alone in my head for a while, but each time I returned to it, rolled the idea around, I liked it more and more. There wasn't a second that I didn't realize it was crazy. I knew logically it wouldn't work, and logically he'd only end up hating me if I actually did it, but how he felt was somehow completely second to having him. I decided that I'd buy him prostitutes if he wanted, I'd buy him whatever he wanted, keep up to date on his comics and shows and make sure he never missed any of them.

When I moved, despite being single, I got an apartment with two bedrooms. I didn't sleep in the master bedroom, because that one was attached to the bathroom and when I captured him, he'd need free access to that. I started researching what would be needed, how to knock someone unconscious without unnecessary medical problems. 

I didn't tell anyone where I was moving, I kept my address a secret by getting a PO Box and putting that down as my official address for work, etc.

My tentative plan was to invite him over, saying I needed help with something computer-related only he could fix. I'd drug him, drag him to his new room, drive his car back to his home, and walk back to mine. We hadn't spoken in months at that point, so I was pretty sure a random past coworker wouldn't be on anyone's list of suspects, especially since we had never really advertised our relationship or break up.

I stopped when I realized it would be impossible to tell if he was allergic to the drug I wanted to use.

I have no idea why that stopped me cold, but it did. I could've come up with some other plan, but at that, I dropped the entire idea. I deleted him from my phone. I moved on. I've had healthy relationships before this, and continued to do so afterward.

Tired of driving a car I have to worry about breaking down any time I pull onto the freeway. Tired of my entire paycheck going to bills and STILL being in the red at the end of the month. Tired of getting a cold or a bad tooth and not being able to go to the doctor for it. Tired of constantly looking out for a better job and not finding one. 

I'm so goddamned tired of not even having the money to replace my worn-out work clothes or pay for health insurance when other people my age go to the bar every weekend and blow their money like it grows off trees in their front yard. Tired of not having any tread on my work boots because I don't have thirty dollars for another pair. 

I'm not joining the Navy to serve my country. I'm doing it to find a home that isn't broken. I'm doing it so I can fall asleep without listening to family members scream at each other over not having enough money to go around. I'm doing it so I can fall asleep without having to worry about how I'm going to make my car payment. 

But I'll tell them whatever they want to hear if they'll take me. 

**EDIT:** Thanks for all of your kind words and comments. It's not that I don't want to ever have to make decisions for myself again, it's just that I'm so tired of being the oldest one and the most responsible one and constantly having to pull myself up by my bootstraps (and make ALL the decisions) just to keep everybody else going. 

For those who are curious, my initial ASVAB score (practice) was 71, and my recruiter is talking nuke school for me. My plan is to sponge up as much secondary schooling as I can get away with while I'm in, and sock away as much of the money I earn as I possibly can so that when (if) I separate after 4-6 years, I don't have to worry about debt ever again. Also, I want to be able to get out and go back to school AGAIN with my GI Bill, if I can swing it. I've never brushed with the law and I've always gotten good grades in school. Just ended up in a dead end because of my home life and money problems. I'm considering going largely ""straight edge"" when I go in, and just make friends with folks as a dependable designated driver, because I have exactly zero desire to get drunk and fuck this up like so many sailors do. 

And I am proud to serve my country, don't get me wrong, but I'd be seriously lying if I said patriotism was my main motivation in this choice. I mostly just want to get away from all of the bullshit I've had to deal with over the past year and be my own person, with more control over my station in life. 

I'm so tired of treading water for everyone else's benefit.

**tl;dr Never supported the Wars abroad in the Middle East when I was younger, and I never thought I'd be someone who could say: ""Will carry a gun for food, medical, and a place to lay my head that I don't have to make domestic violence calls on"" but that's totally where I'm at right now. Being poor has transformed me from a pacifist into an American mercenary. And I can't afford to be ashamed of it. I would shoot a foreign stranger for a steady paycheck at this point.

My father was a heroin addicted, woman beating, lying POS with AIDS. My earliest memories with him were him taking me to dealers houses to play with their kids while he shot up in the next room. 

My mother was the only one who worked and I stayed with him and my grandmother most of the time as we bounced between my paternal and maternal grandmothers homes. My father never hit me or abused me in a direct sense but by the age of five he had taught me how to tie off his arm so he could ""take his medicine"". His mother had given him money to buy my mother a wedding ring, he spent it on heroin. Several Christmases went buy where he found the stash of toys my mother had bought for me and my little sister and sold them for drugs. 

He beat my mother so bad she has a scar on her lip so bad she can't even wear lipstick and even knocked a tooth out. When I was seven she left him for good. His own mother had to move 3k miles away so he couldn't steal from her anymore and during that time he got HIV. For the next decade he would call from a social workers phone or with a calling card his mother would send him to talk to me and my sister. My sister didnt even really remember him and the calls were like talking to an acquaintance we didn't like but were polite to. 

When I was 19 I had my daughter. He begged to be allowed to see his first grandchild and living 2 hours away I was sure he would never come up with the bus fare or the money for a hotel so I agreed. To my horrible surprise he did. His first night he came to our apartment and I made dinner. Without me knowing he slipped into the bathroom and shot up. He came out and picked up my newborn baby girl and held her in his lap. As I washed dishes I glanced over to see him nodding out and my baby slowly beginning to roll off his lap onto the floor. I literally dove and caught her. I threw him out. 

Now he had saved enough money to come up but not any to get back to the shelter where he was living. I had told him in passing where I was working and he started living in the woods across from the office building. Every morning he would run out in front of my car asking me to go buy him coffee, food, etc. I would refuse. Now the job I had was a blessing. I did medical billing and had a great talent for it and at 19 I had my own office and an assistant 2x my age! I was so proud!! We were a very professional office with dress codes, etc. He started coming INTO THE OFFICE looking for me. I was mortified! He was homeless, looked and smelled like shit and would loudly announce ""I'm looking for my daughter!"". The upfront staff thought he was just a crazy guy but finally I had to confess the situation to my boss, I broke down in years in front of her. 

My mother and I went to the police but were told the land he was ""camping"" on was public so they couldn't arrest him for trespassing and unless he put his hands on me they couldn't arrest him for harassment. The law was no help.

So my mother and I did the only thing we could think of. On my day off we drove to my job, marched into the woods and found him. My mother was calm and tried telling him he couldn't ruin my job or reputation over coffee and bagels, to call his social worker to get home, etc. I lost my shit. LOST IT. I spewed a lot of things but the only one I truly recall word for word was ""This family is saying 'fuck off' the way you said 'fuck off' every time you stuck that fucking needle in your arm! I'm your first born child and I'm telling you to do me a favor and fucking kill yourself!"".  I'll never forget the look on his face. Shock and even anger.

A week later we got a call from the police. He had killed himself with a lethal overdose of heroin. Now some may think it could have been an accident. My father was a professional drug addict for over 25 years and never had an OD, not once. The coroner called us a week later to tell us despite the fact it was an obvious suicide he was putting down ""accidental overdose"" on the death certificate so we could collect the small bit of life insurance my mother had on him thru her job.

I was thrilled. To this day I LOVE the fact that the bastard took himself out only when I told him too. Had I known I would of told him to when I was a child.

Ever since I was 15, I've been in a serious relationship with my own brother (I'm male, 28 now, he's 30). 

We've always been extremely close. We grew up without our Dad, and had to move a lot across the country. Therefore, we never really made a lot of friends during our childhood, we were pretty much all we had. 

My brother used to date quite a few girls when we were younger and I've always been jealous. I never really knew how, but someday, I just started to see him...differently. I wasn't jealous of him having all the girls while I never had a girlfriend, I was jealous of...not being able to be with him the way they were able to. 

We grew pretty distant because of that and then one day, he confronted me, asking what was wrong and why I was acting so strange. It all escalated, we kissed, I ran away, cliché, cliché, cliché. 

A few days later, he talked to me and we had sex. I just turned 15, then, he was 17. 

It's all really strange to explain...there's no one I feel closer to, no one I'm more comfortable with. He's my brother, he's my best friend, he's the one I'd like to marry. I'm not even sure I'm gay...it's just him. 

We've tried to stop a lot in the past, had girlfriends, but it just...wasn't the same. We always go back to eachother and to be honest, I'm happy about that.

So yeah. That's it. I'm in love with my brother.

I was dating this drug addicted asshole while I was in a darkplace a year ago. He hit me but I ""loved him"". My parents had kicked me out because I  got in a fight(my first and only fight my senior year of highschool.). So I moved in with this guy, did pills every now and then and got shit faced drunk all the time. I just didnt care. I wanted to die I was in such a dark place. I have PTSD from a sexual/physically abusive childhood so I had panic attacks alot. His father was emotionally (?) abusive to him so hearing him yell and cuss all the time made mine worse. Plus his dad flirted with me and touched my ass all the time. Also there was a guy who had just gotten out of prison for 10 years for assalt living there. He also flirted and touched me. I hated it but I had nowhere else to go. I was still in high school. I skipped all the time. 
One day I was with him and like 10 people at a little party type thing in this guys garage. My boyfriend and some guys gave me these pills and I was drinking. I start feeling really weird and I guess I pass out. Next thing I know Im looking up at the ceiling of the garage laying on a couch while my boyfriend rapes me and another guy plays with my boobs and everyone else is watching. I couldnt hear and I couldnt move but I could see. I felt dead. I didnt know what to do. Inside I was freaking out. I remember feeling tears running down my face. I tried to talk but it was just mumbles. I guess I passed out again cause next thing I know I wake up on the couch next to my boyfriend naked. Most of the people are still there sleeping on the concrete floor. I walk back to his house and pretend like it didnt happen up until now. Everyday I hated myself and felt like a disgusting whore. I broke up with him a year ago. I'm with an amazing man(who doesnt know this story) who knows about my fucked up past and loves me for me. I havnt had a panic attack in a year and am completely drug free. My life is awesome now. But everytime I think about this say I want to throw up. I'm scared my boyfriend will think differently of me. I havnt told anyone this. I really want to kill him. Idk I just had to tell someone. 

(sorry about spelling. writing this made me real frazzled)

EDIT: (I posted this in the comments but I want to make sure yall see it.) I forgot to say I started dating my current boyfriend a month after I broke up with my ex. Id known him for a while. I told him and he told me he loves me and will never let anything like this ever happen to me again. I also told him how he pretty much saved my life. And how he is the reason I am happier than I have ever been in my life. I love him so much I cant even believe it and I know he loves me too because he knows everything now and still wants to be with me:) I am just so happy right now that I finally have this off my chest.

My father is 68 and has 12 kids from ages 10-50, from 7 different women. I am the second youngest at 20 years old. I wouldn't really say that he's a bad man - he's just not very smart about choosing who to breed with, and has had a lot of substance abuse problems in his past. For the past few years, he was a lot better since he was raising me and my baby brother by himself, but had relapsed a few times. 

My boyfriend's grandmother is 48. She had my boyfriend's mom at 14, my boyfriend's mom had my boyfriend at 14 as well. Again, substance abuse with the both of them. 

My boyfriend and I started dating in the spring of our sophomore year, and my dad invited BF's family to Thanksgiving dinner later that year. That's when my dad and Grandma got together, and started dating not long after. 

It was really really awkward for my boyfriend and I, as you could probably guess. There were many times where we tried to protest with our families and even almost broke up ourselves, but we've managed to stay together and not let anyone know when they got married last year. Now, not only is my boyfriend also my nephew, but my dad got her pregnant and now I'm expecting a brother or sister. I haven't told anyone about this, and it's still so bizarre and angering to me. I had to let it out somewhere.

The victim and I are still in a relationship.,529,214,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kdu1t/i_am_a_sex_offender_who_is_abused_and_harassed/,"When I was 21, I was in love with a 13 year old girl. I knew her since she was really little and our families were close. We did not expect to fall in love. It was weird and brotherly but didn't really turn into a 'relationship' until toward the end when she was almost 14. 

She wanted me to teach her and said she would do it with this fucked up kid who did drugs instead of me if I didn't. It was actually very mild.

Well the law got involved, long story short, I got in big trouble and am a sex offender for life. Our families who were best friends, are now enemies. It is true we did stuff underage, but nobody cared about the nuances of it, that I was the only one who was there for her, the one who gave her guidance, that she listened to, the only one who was a positive influence, while her father beat her and her mother was verbally abusive. No one cared that I told her over and over that we would have to wait to be in a relationship. 

Now for what I did, not one day passes where I'm not harassed, abused and victimized. 

Even all these years later, word got out in my neighborhood last year when I moved into my house. I get graffiti at my house, signs around planted everywhere to stay away, moms shielding their kids and pulling them into the grass when I'm anywhere near and accusations of being a pedophile. 

Last summer a group of teenagers kidnapped me, threw me in a car, beat me up with bats and threw me out, and the police refused to come and get me. I get threats of violence, and police told me maybe I shouldn't have been a rapist. I am tired of not having the most basic human rights because of the sex offender hysteria. 

I am unable to have a relationship with anyone because they dump me as soon as they find out. 

I still talk to the girl everyday. It is almost 10 years later, and we are very close. Because I'm stuck in my house all day and hiding from society, she is the only one that makes me feel grounded.

I know we belong together. I still love her, and I want to be with her. We talk every day and video cam every single night. She talks all the time about getting married with me, but it's complicated. 

You see, I can't marry her. The memories bring me too much pain. Even though I know our love is right, it brings me too much shame because I know that I did wrong.

After being harassed so much, I am reminded everyday that I am guilty and did the wrong thing by taking advantage of her. People judged me, hurt me, beat me, and threaten to kill me. When the teenagers kidnapped me, I was terrified, they were talking about lighting me on fire, and I thought that was the end. 

The girl wants to be with me, and tells me everyday, but she needs time to bring it up with her family and have them accept it. I could never face them. Right now they would cut her off if they found out we even talk together, let alone were in an online relationship.  

I wish I had the strength to leave this town, to get her and pick up where we started, and start over together. but it is too complicated. I could not be with her without feeling like I'm a pervert, I could not face her family without feeling like scum. I could not bring our families together in marriage as they are now mortal enemies. And she could not tell her family either, as they would cut her off quickly. 

I know we belong together and one day it will all work out. I always did. but all I do everyday is cry about the life together that I feel we were robbed of. I want to be with her so much and she wants to be with me, but for some reason, we can't.

We've been sexually active with one another for nearly ten years (he's my fraternal twin), and although we've lived together throughout that period, for whatever reason no one has ever seemed to find anything strange about the fact, or that neither of us is interested in dating other people.

Lately I know he's been playing with the idea of moving to the other side of the state, which would actually be far away from everyone we know.  We could actually make a new start, and introduce ourselves to people as bf/gf, as opposed to brother and sister, and needing to be so cautious about what we do in public.

Which would be... amazing.  But then both of us would need to come up with fake stories and maintain a different identity, so no one would suspect?  I don't know.  It's both exciting and terrifying.

It works, because while I am not attracted to other men, I am not really disgusted by the human body so I really don't have any problem with physical contact or anything.

I really don't care if it makes me gay, I actually wish I could get more into it. The sex itself is fun, but I have trouble forming an emotional connection with them.

I think the world would be a better place if people realized that everyone has their own fair share of troubles. Everyone has hardships, highs and lows and we shouldn't make snap judgements of people when we don't know their back-stories. It's always easier to be self-righteous then to sympathize, the former gets you all puffed up and feeling all superior while the latter forces you into another persons shoes and can leave you emotionally drained. Sometimes I wonder why people are born so bad; to think the worst of other people all the time. 

A few months ago, my friend and I were in a queue for a bus that goes directly to the hospital. It was an extremely long queue and when the bus finally arrived, a woman cut the line right in front of me! I was beyond pissed. How could anyone be so rude?! Luckily, the bus got too crowded and the while person in front of her managed to get on, she didn't. She flashed the worst bitch-face I've ever seen (seriously unforgettable) and I secretly laughed at her misery. Hah! Serves her right for cutting my queue! My friend and I started discussing her behavior, very loudly so she could hear it - ""B*tch cut my queue, and STILL couldn't get on the bus, what an idiot!"" We were bitching non-stop about her, judging her appearance from head to toe, completely passive-aggressive. She pretended not to hear anything for about 10 minutes. Then finally, she turned to me, looked me in the eye and said ""Please help. I am going to faint right now. I need to get to the hospital right now or I'll die."" Her words shocked me and made me feel ashamed. Within 5 seconds, she lost consciousness and landed on the ground with a thud, but not before grabbing my arm. We helped her, but till today I still feel bad about treating someone who was in distress so badly. 

I guess the reason I am writing this is that I got a tiny taste from the other side of the fence today. I am 20 years old and suffer from a disease that deteriorates my eyes and makes them look terrible (currently, I have one protruding eye). I was just told that not only will my condition and the appearance of my eyes never improve, but I might go blind someday soon. The diagnosis was scary and I felt really numb yet sad. I am at the prime of my life, I should be out partying, dating and enjoying my youth but instead I'm scary looking, have lop-sided eyes and a whole bunch of mental issues. I was in a daze when I walked up the bus, kinda in my own world, feeling scared about going blind and burying my worries. I didn't even realize I had accidentally cut the queue of a whole bunch of people who were fuming mad at me. One lady gave me a earful, telling me to watch it, and she just wouldn't stop. I honestly didn't have the energy to deal with it, didn't give a shit about the queue. Hell, FUCK the queue, I'm going FUCKING BLIND! I ended up crying the entire bus ride home. I was trying so hard to hold it all in, but when the lady started berating me I just lost it. And everybody thought I was a complete weirdo for crying because some random lady outed me for cutting the queue. 

After this experience, I am never EVER gonna berate queue-cutters again. Sure, 80% of them might simply be assholes...but there is always the odd 20%.

Everyone was kind of off doing their own thing. My brother was sitting on a bed and I say down next to him. I (innocently) had my hand on his knew/thigh as we were talking and before I knew it, we were groping each other and kissing like crazy. We were both really drunk as I said before. We haven't spoken since this happened, only exchanged odd glances at each other. I can only hope that I don't get pregnant seeing how we didn't have any protection.

Update: I finally talked to my brother last night. Things seem a lot less awkward now. He assured me that nobody would find out and that it was a stupid drunk decision. We talked for several hours about that night, our childhood, and the future. I think talking to people here on Reddit has helped me realize that I don't need to feel super ashamed about it. It will probably just take some time but I think this will somehow make me a better person. You make mistakes and you learn from them. It didn't hurt anyone. We both wanted it (at the time). There is no reason that this should ruin any relationship now or in the future.

I remember me and Luke (older brother) asleep in our room and you would walk in and grab one of us. I would pray it was Luke, I know that is fucked up but it’s true. I didn’t want to get hit. You would grab us and beat the shit out of whoever you had the misfortune to nab. People still comment on my crooked nose and my split eyebrows, I tell them I box and that I play hockey. Girls I’m with talk about the scars on my back and I tell them they are bad acne scars but we both know they are from cigarette butts.

I know your old man wasn’t any better. Hell the stab wound on your gut says he may have been worse. But why pas it down, why give this to someone you are supposed to love. i don’t have any kids but if I did, and I thought I was going to be like you I would put a gun in my mouth. They are better off without a dad then a continuation of this.

I was stronger than Luke. He was smarter and kinder than me but at the end of the day it didn’t do him any good , you made sure of that. He is a wreak, all the substance abuse you  had but not the animal cunning to keep him out of trouble. Me I work 80 hours a week to keep myself from thinking about anything. I know that moment of introspection will kill me. 

I remember you kicking mom’s teeth out. 

I remember you smashing someone’s hand with a ball peen hammer over something petty. 

I remember the terror you struck in me when you walked in to a room.

Last edit of the night: Heading to bed. I'll check back in the morning for new comments. Happy endings!

(context: I'm a guy in my early 20's, MT is a girl in her late 20's) It was totally unexpected because not only is this massage place legit, I've been going for actual pain issues (active release therapy) and not the typical relaxing massage. I'm in pain/uncomfortable for roughly 85% of the time I'm there. Never once got an erection until ""prompted"" today.

I usually leave my underwear and socks on. Last time I went, I took off my socks. This time, I had run out of my usual boxer briefs so I wore looser boxers and again took off my socks. (Maybe this was the transition sign?) The massage and therapy itself was a little better with looser underwear and the therapist found some new pain/trigger points on my glutes and thighs without the tight boxer briefs getting in the way. STOP READING HERE TO SKIP TMI.

*To start the fun portion of the massage, I was on my back and she first went up through the front with light strokes, something she had never done before. At this point I figured she was doing new massage things because of the looser underwear. Then one hand slowly crept down the front and things started clicking in my head. She whispered into my ear, ""Is this ok?"" and I nodded. I had a hot towel draped over my face as I normally do when I'm on my back so I didn't see what all she did but it was mostly one-handed and I assume she shot my load into her free hand since I didn't feel any towel cleanup on my torso.*

I think I tipped her 80% or some shit. Seriously, WW3 could've been going on outside and I wouldn't have noticed. The session ended as usual with her recommending stretches and activities for me to do.

Not only did he do this, but he invited me to sit and watch/browse with him. I looked up to him. Adored him. Anything he wanted me to do/he did, I did. He was my idol.

One day while my parents were out at Home Depot buying paint for my room, he came into my room and somehow convinced me to take off my clothes. Out of some manner of desperation for my brothers attention, I did so. This progressed to him telling me to kiss him. After that he had me perform oral sex.

I knew it was wrong, for the conscience of a young child is not entirely undeveloped. However, the entire thing is only a blur now that I am older, but I distinctly remember him leaving and coming back 15 minutes later. He said ""That was wrong and I'm sorry. Don't tell Mom &amp; Dad, okay?"" in a manner that I can only describe as ashamed, yet nonchalant. I said ""okay"" like the good little brother I was.

One day in 4th grade the memory of that event surfaced and I started weeping in the middle of class. My, now more defined conscience, knew exactly to what extend had happened and now every day I think at least once of the event. Currently my brother is married. I have never spoken to him about it. I am currently in high school and this is the first open proclamation I have made of it.

As I wrote this, I began to cry.

Thanks Reddit.

Edit: More information.

We were both raised in a very strict and conservative christian household. While I am openly understanding in the fact that kids do stupid things, my conscience is running off of the ideals chiseled into me through the years. 

Soon after the event, I was caught ""experimenting"" with a friend of mine that came over to my house.

1374953041.0,304,self.confession,1j6akj,I'm Asian and I hate Asian culture because of my parents,369,65,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1j6akj/im_asian_and_i_hate_asian_culture_because_of_my/,"Background: I'm a 19 year old college kid in the US who has immigrant Chinese parents. 

My parents are pretty much the stereotypical immigrant Asian parents. They're controlling, unreasonable, patronizing, and strict. I am grateful for them taking care of me all these years, but I can't stand being around them. And let me start out by saying that I don't consider myself a spoiled brat. I go to a top university, have a 9-5 job in a big company, and I didn't even get a cell phone until I went off to college. 

My parents are always criticizing everything I do 24/7. Anything I do that isn't reading or studying is a waste of time for them, so I pretty much can't do anything during my daily life without getting criticized. 

My dad is extremely arrogant and treats me like I'm a 5 year old. But at least he's somewhat reasonable and stable. What has really been driving me insane though is the fact that my mom is emotionally unstable. She's extremely manipulative, narcissistic, and she feeds off of other people's displeasure. She often has huge mood swings. Whenever she's in a bad mood, she takes her anger out on others. Sometimes, I'm just sitting there minding my own business when my mom just randomly chews me out for being a useless slob who can't do shit. She will find anything to yell at me for when she's not in a good mood. Just today, she saw a single sock that I dropped on the floor of my room and started screaming at me about how I'm such a filthy person who can't keep my shit together. Basically, whenever she's mad, she will throw a fucking tantrum and use others as emotional punching bags. In her twisted mind, she is above everyone else. There's no possible way for her to ever be wrong because she has no flaws. Plus she is always threatening to drop me out of college and disown me. 

Even worse, she is extremely cheap and has no logic when it comes to money. She never lets me go anywhere, because gas costs money. Whenever I use a tissue and throw it away, she yells at me for ""wasting"" it when I can use it again (which is fucking gross). I get yelled at for working out or exercising because it costs money to wash clothes and take showers. She says shit like this on a daily basis, and it drives me insane. 

I almost never talk to my parents about anything. They know nothing about my personal life at all. They often say I'm being a bad son for not talking to them, but why the fuck would I want to talk to them when all they do is criticize me and refuse to try to understand stuff from my point of view?

Unfortunately, because of my parents, I've started to have feelings of resentment for their whole culture. I hate Asian culture these days, and basically all of its customs. I hate how Asian kids are instilled with a belief that their parents are perfect people who are never wrong. I hate how anything outside of studying and reading is looked down upon as a waste of time. I hate how Asian parents pretty much see themselves as shareholders and their kids as stocks, and the kids are expected to do nothing but be be high value investments for the parents. I hate how Asian parents are always putting their kids down and comparing them to others. I hate how being quiet, submissive, and beta is encouraged in Asian culture. I hate all this ""Tiger Parent"" and ""Confucious say"" horse shit. 

I know it's not rational to hate an entire culture because of my parents, but I can't really change the way I feel. I absolutely will not date an Asian girl, and I automatically get feelings of prejudice whenever I see or meet Asians. Whenever someone asks if I'm Chinese, I say no, I'm American. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. I know some of my feelings are irrational, and I just wanted to get them off my chest. I am grateful for having parents who pay for college and provide me with food and shelter. In the end they are smart and hardworking people. But that doesn't mean I enjoy being around them or see them as good role models.

1335341456.0,308,self.confession,srhd4,When I was 14 I prostituted myself out to one of my best friend's dad on a regular basis.,382,74,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/srhd4/when_i_was_14_i_prostituted_myself_out_to_one_of/,"I've been debating for a long time whether or not I should share this here and finally decided to after a chat I just had with the friend ""Roger"". I was so close to telling him about what I did with his dad all those years ago but decided not to b/c he thinks of his father, ""Mr. Jones"" as a total saint esp. since his passing a couple years ago. It would break his heart to know about this but I have to tell someone the whole truth (one IRL friend knows part of this but I never told anyone the full story).

So basically I went through a phase when I was 14 where I was being the typical rebellious teenage girl and my big act of rebellion was basically being a huge slut. I was having sex already and put on this ""I can do whatever I want"" attitude. Keep in mind my mom had been calling me names like slut and whore since I was as young as ten. I think part of me thought like I would be getting back at her somehow by actually behaving that way you know? So while most girls my age thought third base was a big deal I acted like sex was no big thing. Oh, I didn't sleep with every boy who wanted me but I gave out handjobs and blowjobs like they were nothing.

So yeah most of my best friends were guys and one day I was riding my bike back from another friend's house when my front wheel blew. I had a cell phone but my mom had taken it away as punishment for skipping class or something. Well I happened to be near Roger's house so I stopped there to see if I could use his phone to call my dad and ask for a ride home.

Mr. Jones was the only person home and when I explained the situation he said he'd gladly give me a ride home himself if I was willing to wait a few minutes. I was really relieved b/c I didn't want to walk the bike home and I knew my dad would be annoyed if he had to come get me. So I waited in his living room while he did something upstairs.

I had known Roger and therefore his dad for a long time so I was really comfortable being alone in a house with him. When he called down for me to come upstairs so he could show me something I thought it was a little weird but didn't think much of it I just went. When I got to his bedroom I found him sitting on his bed wearing nothing but a bathrobe which was hanging open enough so that I could see his penis which was erect.

I remember just standing there in shock as he smiled and went into full creeper mode. He told me I was very beautiful and he wanted to have a serious talk with me and asked me to come have a sit next to him on the bed. I know I should have taken off but I didn't. I kind of thought ""Of course he wants me it's no big deal"" and got into my rebellious frame of mind at the thought of having sex with one of my best friend's dad.

So I sat next to him and he told me how Roger had told him that the reason I hadn't been able to join them to a baseball game a few weeks earlier was b/c I didn't have the money. He also said that he knew I wasn't a virgin and a girl like me had no reason to be broke. He started touching me as he droned on and on about how there were ways for attractive girls to make money and he would ""take care"" of me if I ""took care"" of him.

And I agreed with everything he said and actually got turned on by the idea. So we did it, right there in the bed he shared with his wife, not even using protection which was a first for me. And I'll be honest it was great sex, definitely the best sex I'd ever had at the time. When we were done he told me to get dressed and while I did he laid out $200 in 20s and 10s on the bed and told me it was mine.

After that we had a system. He would text me a single character when he wanted me to come over. Each character stood for a different situation, like a 1 meant ""Come to the house"" while a 2 meant ""Meet me at the gas station"". I didn't *always* go when he asked but I did more often than I didn't.

And wow did he get me into some kinky stuff too. He paid $200 every time for straight up sex but gave ""bonuses"" for more. Like, $50 if I blew him first or to let him spank me, $300 instead of the $200 for anal (which we only did once I think), another $20 to tie me up and one time he paid me an obscene amount of money to let him piss on me. Yes literally piss on me, my face my hair my breasts everything. 

We had this arrangement for only about three months but I probably saw him twice a week. Made a lot of money during those three months. The whole thing ended sort of out of the blue too. One day he sent a text that meant I should come to his house and when I got there he said we had to stop ""seeing"" each other. He gave me $200 just for coming over but said that would be the last time he ever contacted me and it was.

Even at the time all this was happening I really felt bad b/c I felt like I was somehow betraying Roger but honestly that was part of the thrill. Eventually I had a pregnancy scare with someone else and that snapped me out of being so wreckless and irresponsible and I mostly stopped doing such wild shit like that. But yeah... Mr. Jones is now dead, I even went to the funeral and had to look at Mrs. Jones in the face and give condolences and think ""Oh god I hope she doesn't know"". Roger definitely doesn't know but I still wonder why his dad ended things so abruptly the way he did and one theory is that maybe his wife found out somehow? I don't know.

One last thing I want to say before I hit save-- obviously all the names in this post are fake and I also mixed around some of the timeline just in case. It did happen when I was 14 but things like how long it went on and when Mr. Jones died are purposely vague.

About two nights ago I was talking to the person who knows the most about me. We were discussing some of the more ""shady"" experiences of my life and they said they always held back on their true feelings about these things. They said I should feel guilty and ashamed, they also said that my lack of emotion surrounding it concerned them deeply. What we were discussing was my side job as a naked house cleaner, which I know is very common on the internet. 

I go to a man's house, get naked and clean. Sometimes I just sit there and talk. Once I allowed pictures to be taken (without my face of course) and only because he agreed to send the pictures to me. I was just curious about what I looked like cleaning naked. I masturbated for guys twice, but I never once allowed a guy to touch me. My friend told me I was a prostitute and that I was exploiting myself, but I honestly never saw it that way. If anything I felt I was exploiting lonely, bored men who could put their money and time to much better use. The only thing I do feel guilty about is that the majority of them have wives or girlfriends that I know are totally clueless about what their SO is doing. I know that if it weren't for me that these men would just look elsewhere ( a lot of the times I am not even the only girl coming over without their SO's knowledge), so honestly I don't even really feel that guilty about that part.

The only thing I do feel guilty is lying to my family and some of my friends. If I am unemployed and I have a lot of money I just say I did some work ""under the table"" or that I saved because I am not good lair. If anyone asks too many questions I just change the subject. I don't like to lie, but if my family found out it would completely devastate them and I would be forced to hang out with my weird uncle in the corner at all my family gatherings and parties. 

Since my friend came clean a lot of the people who know this about me have come clean about how they feel as well and because I feel differently they think there must be something wrong with me. I would prefer to not do this and I know it can't last forever, but I don't see what the big deal is. The reason I don't enjoy it is not because I have to get naked, but because of the awkward small talk. Which concerns my closest friend even more, I think. 

Also, I did some consensual black mail fetish, and humiliation ""work"" and have also abused a middle aged Indian man for money. He liked for me to beat him up and spit on him, he also loved to worship my feet. All of this just seems fun and interesting to me. I guess I am alone in thinking that. I feel like all of these things ( naked house cleaning included ) have taught me a lot and even cured a lot of my anxiety issues.

Okay, here goes.

 Last year, I was on a medication that, as a side effect, gave me horrible stomach cramps, diarrhea, you name it. I had scheduled a doctor's appointment to switch over to a new medication, but at the time, I needed the drug to keep my depression in check. So I kept taking the drug, figuring I'd just have to deal with it in the meantime.

At the time, I was a second semester freshman, studying English. One morning, I woke up realizing, ""Hey, I feel pretty shitty."" However, I'd skipped class four or five times already, and worse yet, today was a ""workshop""-type class (meaning somebody reads a creative writing piece and the rest of the class critiques it), which meant that it would be more difficult to slip out if I got sick. I decided to just deal with it. Big mistake.

I was sitting in class, near the front, when I started to feel the cramps. At the time, I was sort of used to those. I'd found that if I breathed deeply and focused, I could sort of will away the cramps and move on. They got worse, though. The rest of the class was busy critiquing away some girls terrible story when I felt that sort of jolt you get when you know something inside you wants to be outside you and is about to be outside of you REALLY fucking fast. I squirmed in my seat and weighed my options. There was no way I was going to do something in here. I had to get out.

I think I managed to say something like, ""I gotta leave,"" before I bolted out of there. At this point, the cramp had decided it was exiting out of the upper orifice, and I could feel the bile rising up my throat. I was literally puking as I bolted out of the room, and lo and behold, there was a conveniently placed trash can right outside the door! I puked. Hard. Like stars in my eyes, everything fade to black hard. But the sheer act of vomiting made me lose control of the rest of my body.

And THAT was when the diarrhea came.

I was basically vomiting and shitting at the same time. My jeans were wet, and the front of my tee-shirt was soaked. I saw a bathroom nearby, and basically ran for it, ignoring this really confused-looking guy nearby. I hid in a stall and did more business. I removed my pants and just looked down at them. There was a massive brown stain covering the back, all the way down both legs.

I remember peeking out of the bathroom and asking the guy, who was still sitting there, if he could run into the classroom I had been in and get me my bag (my phone was in there). Bless his heart, he did. And then left. Quickly.

I called my roommate to ask her to possibly bring me a pair of jeans, and, naturally, she didn't answer. There was literally only one thing to do. By then, I had been in there for about 45 minutes, and the smell was terrible. If someone came in, they would know right away that something was very rotten in the state of Denmark. I didn't want to talk to anyone. So, I slid the wet jeans back onto my legs, and wrapped a light jacket around my waist to cover up the majority of the stain (although you could still see it on the legs), grabbed my bag, and in the middle of winter, left the building and walked back down to my residence hall.

It was the longest walk of my life. By that point, I'm pretty sure I was crying. At one point, I threw up again, into a nearby garbage can. Pretty sure the kids who were staring at me thought I was an alcoholic or something. Anyway, I got back, showered, wrapped my shitty clothes into three layers of scented garbage bags, tossed them, and promptly went to sleep for about 12 hours straight. I woke up to my roommate saying something like, ""God it smells nasty in here...think we gotta clean out the fridge.""

",399,98,325,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nk9kx/my_wife_and_i_are_sleeping_with_the_neighbors/,"My wife and I are in our thirties, and so are our neighbors.  My wife and I occasionally fooled around with other people, but it had always been sporadic. 

Neighbor wife is tall, beautiful, intelligent, and has a great career. In short, she's kick-ass. Neighbor husband is an IT guy for a small company. He's irritable, has no sense of humor, and does nothing but play video games with every free moment he has. He's essentially a dumbass 13 year old trapped in a 35 year old body.

Over the years, we have always been friendly with both of them, inviting them over or to go out with us. We always got along better with just her, but of course we always invited them both out of courtesy. 

This spring we decided to have a weekly movie night, and invited them over. They both showed up the first time. They both showed up the second time, but he immediately went home to play games since the movie wasn't to his liking. He never showed up after that, but she got in the habit of coming over once a week without him. 

Fast forward to late summer. I was out with my friends, my wife and his wife were having movie night. I get home to find neighbor wife crying on the couch, my wife cuddling and consoling her. Neighbor doesn't get attention, they never have sex, etc. I left them alone, and didn't think anything of it. 

Next week, it's movie night. Neighbor comes over, and it's me and the two girls on the couch, watching the movie. My wife was massaging my shoulders, and out of the blue neighbor wife joins in. This had apparently been planned the week before. One alcohol fueled move after another, and we're all in the bedroom.

Now we fuck on a weekly basis. She comes over, we have ""movie night"", which consists of my wife and I fucking her like crazy, then she leaves. It's perfect, it's convenient, and I love it. 

And I don't feel bad about it. At all.

But I am still seeing a *huge* number of people posting personal attacks and vindictive comments to OP's in this sub. And I'm fucking sick of it. I know the nature of some of the confessions on here can get pretty ugly. Just the other day we had a guy admit he was happy knowing his kids are criminals. I get it, that's some pretty heavy shit, and the OP in that post was clearly an asshat. But, it says it right there in the sidebar, *we are not here to judge others*. Honestly, the visceral reactions I've seen from some people here is absolutely enough to steer me clear of ever confessing anything on here. And I think that's dangerous. These personal attacks are jeopardizing the nature and purpose of this sub. Now, I know there will always be those who feel it necessary to make people feel bad for their confessions, so I'm calling on the mods to become stricter with these types of comments. These commenters should be warned with a threat of banning and repeat offenders should be banned. The mods don't seem to take this very seriously at all and it's appalling the amount of nasty comments that seem to stick around for hours on a post. Yes, you can always report these comments and we should all continue to do this. But this doesn't seem to be enough and its generating an atmosphere on this sub that *doesn't* communicate this is a safe place. Now, this doesn't mean you can't say anything about anyone's behavior ever. You should still be able to tell someone their actions are deceitful, wrong, destructive or even deplorable, in a constructive manner, with rational reasoning that backs up *why* their behavior is like that, without being personal or mean. I'm more so talking about the comments that have no other value other than making the OP feel like a piece of shit. If I'm just bitching and everyone is happy with these comments still having a presence on the sub, then move right along. But I feel this is harming this sub and creating an environment in which people don't feel comfortable confessing, which makes this sub a bit redundant.

Told my husband it was a miscarriage.,428,131,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ey05e/had_an_abortion_told_my_husband_it_was_a/,"My husband and I have been married for 2 years, together for almost four. He's always been very eager to have kids. I want them to but I told him I wanted to finish college first. 

He said why don't we have kids first and then you can go back when they're older? But I said no and we had many fights about this and he finally agreed and we got married. 

I graduated and was very lucky to find a job in my field. The hours are shitty and the pay is worse, but jobs in this field are really hard to come by and there's a good chance of better things because my boss really likes my work.

We agreed to wait a year or two and then start trying, but my husband wanted me to stop taking birth control because he thinks it's a waste of money to be using both BC and condoms. Thing is, I am super careful about the pills but he is not always about condoms, but he kept pressuring me so I agreed. 

So now come to a few months later where he keeps forgetting to put the condom on, or he put it on wrong, and I fell pregnant. I was so upset when I found out. I am not ready to be a mother yet! But he was so excited. 

I told him I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, and I wanted to keep the news to ourselves for a while. But the very next day  he blurted it out in front of my family. He said he couldn't help it because he was so excited. My family very much wants us to have babies, especially my mother who has got the baby rabies soo bad right now. 

Right away everyone was so loud and excited and I felt this huuuge pressure to act like I was happy. I couldn't say anything about how I really felt. The only one who noticed that I wasn't happy was my sister, who is my best friend and doesn't deserve the shit way my family always treats her.

Later she asked me how I felt and what I wanted to do. In all this time she is the ONLY one who asked me that. I started crying and crying because I felt like finally someone cares how I feel. 

Anyway, long story short, I got an abortion last week and went back on BC without telling him. I told him it was a miscarriage. He is devastated. I feel so bad for him because he's in so much pain, and it's my fault. But then I feel angry because he didn't care when I was the one in pain.

Since last week I've been alternating between being totally numb and being an emotional wreck. I just feel so angry towards him sometimes, I fee llike it's all his fault I got pregnant, even though I know, in my head, it was both of us. I feel like this is what he wanted. 

He thinks I'm emotional because of the baby, but I don't want to be a mom yet. I haven't even lived yet! My husband is 5 years older than me and laready went through his wild stage. He wants to ""settle down."" But I went from being a straight A student to the model college student and perfect wife. I'm 23 and I've never gotten drunk or travelled or even driven above the speed limit. Ever! 

I want to travel to other countries, meet new people, try exciting and fun things that my family would never let me do. But I know my husband wants to start trying again right away. He doesn't want to spend money on traveling because he wants to save for the baby. AGH! 

I just feel so trapped, like my all life is all laid out for me and all I can do is submit. If this is the rest of my life then I don't want to live it anymore.



Edit: I didn't expect so many comments. I can't check this at home and work has been super busy so I haven't read them all. Will try to answer a couple questions quickly though.

What would he do if he found out? He'd be angry but he doesn't believe in divorce for any reason. Ever. So I don't know. Maybe he'll feel differently when it's about him.

Why did I go off birth control? Because when he gets an idea in his head he will not stop about it. Also, because of past relationships he is very fragile, emotionally. He saw my disagreement as rejection. We had huge fights and he would cry and hurt himself. After some months I gave up. My fault, I know.

I don't think he intentionally sabotaged the condoms. When he's excited he tends to mess up, not jus about birth control. like when he said he wouldn't tell my family but he got caught up and told them or when he promises to be nice to my sister but starts fighting with her because they disagree on everything.

Counselling - we went to a church counsellor and he mostly talked about how children are a blessing, but nothing about how we could disagree without my husband feeling attacked. I would change if it would help but I don't know how.

Why did I marry him - I love him and  80% of the time he's the most amazing man. He always says how he loves me, he'll die without me, etc. Only 20% of the time we fight and sometimes it gets bad. But then we make up and he's amazing and kind. It used to he worse but since I learned to read his moods we fight much less. 

What do I want to do? I don't really want to get drunk etc. But always, living with my parents, I was never allowed to do anything dangerous or unfeminine - think rock climbing or hiking. I thought it would be better when I got married but its worse.

married too young - I don't know. Most girls in my church/community get married at this age so it seems normal to me.

My brother has always been a huge asshole and a sadistic fuck. He is a good deal older than me--about seven years. When I was a baby he enjoyed fighting and tormenting my sister (three years older than me), but once I turned four or five, he directed his attention to me. 

He would tell me that he was going to murder me in my sleep by slitting my throat. He reminded me constantly that I was going to die. He would laugh maniacally as I freaked out. I remember on several occasions crying and panicking about my fear of death to my parents and grandparents. 

My parents never really disciplined him about these things, and if they did, it was never severe enough to make him change his ways. He is the most arrogant, stubborn, and proud person I have ever met, so he would constantly push back and fight with my parents and cause trouble both at home and at school. 

From when I was about 7 years old to 10 years old, my brother molested me. Repeatedly. Turning it into games that young me would be more likely to ""agree"" to, as I was often very reluctant to participate. I remember a lot of them pretty vividly. Motorcycles. Police. Salon. I was too young too understand how much I was being violated. 

Now that I'm older (almost 20) I finally get just how violated I was and how inappropriately he behaved towards me. I hate him. I want him to know how much he hurt me. Of course, he is too much of a psychotic asshole to ever think what he did was wrong, and even if he did, he would never apologize. 

The long-term effects are things I have to live with every day of my life. The lack of trust is one, to the point that I have never even kissed a guy let alone had a boyfriend. I am just convinced I will be taken advantage of, and do everything  I can to protect myself from that. Additionally, I constantly feel torn between telling my family and not telling my family. I am afraid of how they will react. I feel marginalized and disregarded. It has also caused me to build a wall in my friendships because I don't feel comfortable enough to tell them about what happened to me. I have only told 2 very, very close friends.

The biggest problem is how protective my parents are of him. He has dealt with mental health for a few years now and has told my parents that he has had suicidal thoughts. I am terrified that if I say anything about the sexual abuse, my parents will react negatively and protect him, or he it will drive him to kill himself. I don't want him to kill himself because of something I did. 

I don't want it to be my fault.

I just want him to be gone.

Thank you for everything you did for me.  I'm still alive because of you.  You know I'll always be there for you, doing everything I can that you ask me to.  I won't be the reason you're unhappy ever again.  You deserve a perfect life that I failed to give you!!!

 Minimal Backstory:  I married the woman of my dreams.  She left after 5 years.  I was diagnosed with a mental illness that changed everything about me and turned me into what I considered to be a horrible monster.  She tried to get me to get help for two and a half a years before leaving.  I never did, I don't remember most of our life together because of my mental problems.   I will never know the details of most of what I did, who I was then,  because you know it will kill me more on the inside and take me back to that darkness.  
You saved my life, literally and figuratively countless time, even with me being as horrible as I was.  Realistically, you were the only one there for me, stood by my side even after leaving. 

It's been two years now.  It's easier to hide, but I'll never get over you.  I still love you with all my heart. It killed me helping you move in with your boyfriend. But,  I'm glad that you found happiness again and I won't get in the way of that.  I'll always be there for you doing whatever I can to help.  Not just because I owe you, but because you still mean the world to me.  
I'm thankful that we have a great relationship now.  I don't think I could handle not having you in my life at all.  
I'm better now, but the damage is done and I know we can never be again. Words cannot begin to express how sorry I am for what happened or how thankful I am to have had you and everything you did for me.  I still break down every so often.  Just not everyday anymore.
It does make me miserable that you speak so highly of me still, knowing what little I do as to how I was. I've asked you why you have nothing but nice things to say and compliment me to people that don't know me.  Because you know that that wasn't who I really was/am and my mental issues weren't my fault.  Several times now, I've met people in your circle and they tell me how great I am from how much they have heard from you about me....if they only knew, I guess

Everything is still screwed up.,387,95,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15tl3v/i_was_raped_one_year_ago_everything_is_still/,"Last year, on New Year's Eve, I was at a party. It was at a friend's house. A lot of people were there. I wasn't drinking alcohol, just water. I was being the DD that night for everyone, so I was trying to be good. A guy walked up to me. I had seen him around in some of my classes at the university I attended. He struck up a conversation about the party, then asked me why I wasn't drinking. I told him why. He was a really nice guy. 

We walked around the party together. My brother called me, so I went upstairs into an empty room to talk to him (it was too loud downstairs). I could have just went outside, but there were so many people in the yard that it was still loud. It's my own fucking fault. 

The guy came into the room where I was, asked if everything was okay. I said yes (my brother just wanted to know if I could pick him up from another party later on). We sat around, had small talk. I found out that he had the same major that I did. We talked about our plans after graduation, etc. He was really sweet.

I stood up to go to the bathroom, but my phone fell from my lap and rolled under the bed. When I bent down to get it, I guess that's when he saw his opportunity. I felt a hand grab my shirt and pull me up. He put his hand over my mouth so I wouldn't scream, I guess. I was frozen in shock. He undid his pants, then pulled mine down. That's when I started struggling, but he threw me down on the bed and my head hit the wall. I was dazed. He began to sodomize me. The pain was unbearable. I tried to scream, but he wadded the sheet up and shoved it in my mouth.

He laughed the entire time. Until he finished. He pulled me up and kissed my cheek, then he thanked me. I laid there, bleeding from my anus, and just stared at the wall. Pants around my ankles, ass in the air. 

After that, life was just fucked up for me. I didn't experience any emotions or feel anything. I only went through the motions of life. I went to class, sat with friends, but I didn't feel. At all. I was numb. About a month after it happened, I got an STD screening and it came back clean. 

I never told anyone. Why? Because I'm a 6'2"", 180lbs guy. Not scrawny, I can hold my own. So who will believe me? Really? 

But this New Year's, I was sitting in my room, and when the clock struck 12, I could feel the guy's hand across my mouth. I had a panic attack. The first one I've had since it happened. I haven't seen him at all. Not on campus, not at parties. 

I've isolated myself from all of my friends. And it has taken me a year to admit it, but: I was raped. 

I contemplated suicide briefly a few months ago, but I was too afraid of not doing it correctly (funny story, huh?) And that feeling of hopelessness has since passed. I'm more... angry now. At myself. It's my fault. I was raped, and it's my fault. I should have stopped him. 

I feel like I'm suffocating all the time. I just want to breathe again.

**EDIT**: I just made an appointment with my on-campus counseling service. My appointment is January 14th. I feel so hyped up, nervous, sick to my stomach, and happy -- all at once! It's all thanks to all of you for your encouragement. If I could give you all Reddit gold, I would. I've also found a few support groups online with the help of some of you, and I have the number to a hotline that I can call if I ever need someone to talk to. 

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all of you. Every. Single. One. Of. You. that helped me on this post, sent me kind messages, and commented with ways to get myself back on track. Reddit is great. :-)

**Edit #2:** I would like to personally thank every single one of you that came forth with your own stories and were brave enough to tell me. The bravery that I have seen from you guys is just beyond me. Thank you so much for what you have done for me. I don't think you guys will ever really know just how grateful I am. For now, I'm going to try and get an earlier counseling appointment. I actually spoke to one of my friends earlier -- in person -- after not seeing him for over five months.

Ive been bottling this stuff up for a long time. I guess I should start at the beginning. In the summer of 2012 i was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at the age of 21, on the same day my girlfriend of 7 months left me. Which to date was my longest relationship. I was devastated. But when she broke up with me, i physically felt something happen in my brain. I heard the sound of paper tearing and i started shaking, but I didnt cry. I started laughing, this high pitched hysterical laughter that I can only compare to that of Mark Hamil's Joker. The following monday I had my colon removed, which sucked. I went emotionally numb, I just turned off and I can remember very clearly waking up once surrounded by family and friends. All these good decent people that loved me, and I thought to myself ""I would kill all of you if it meant I would be healthy."". And I dont feel guilty over it. Which is wrong. I know its wrong but I cant feel bad. So anyway, I did eleven rounds of chemo and over the months I dated three women, used all of them for sex and dumped them all on the same day. And I felt no guilt. But while I was on chemo, I would wake up in the night and see shadowy figures of people. Always just staring at me and I actively hallucinated on occasion during the day. So I am pretty sure I was having a mental breakdown but never realized it. 

After I finished my chemo the first time I went into remission and gained a new lease on life, I started school again, got a job ,started working. And then I went to the ER for abdominal pain. They found a lymphnode with cancer in it. Apparently the cancer was a resistant strain of cancer and survived. So now I am on my second session of chemo, tomorrow I do my fourth round. And then they will run tests to see if this chemo has worked at all. I asked my doctor what would happen if it didnt work. She refused to speak on the matter. Ive done my research, if the chemo didnt work they will operate and remove the lymphnode which is behind my liver. And I have become so apathetic towards everything, i stopped going to class, i stopped going to work, all I do is pursue my hobbies in an attempt to drown my fear with distraction. But the fear sits in my gut everyday and everyday is a struggle just to keep my composure. I cant die, My mother wouldnt survive the depression(shes attempted suicide in the past) and I cant trust my dad to look after my brother. The only comfort I have if I die is that my brother will be taken care of(I have a really large life insurance policy thats left all to him). I cant talk to my friends, I dont want to look like a coward.

I grew up in the ultra conservative part of the Middle East where the only visible parts on a woman are either her eyes, hands or feet.  And I hit puberty before the internet was available...all I had were random pictures of people.

I absolutely loved this one picture of a girl, who was my age, and distantly related.  She was covered but her foot was visible. And I would masturbate every day to the thought of exploring her body as I moved from her foot upwards.  I found rather quickly that different people had different shaped feet...and that I preferred the ones that resembled this girls.  I spent my time going through our photo albums for women who had similar shaped feet. 

Then came the internet and it was amazing.  Porn. All sorts of porn.  And pictures. So many pictures.  I started saving pictures of feet I liked. They were all similar.  But as I grew older, I realized that while feet turned me on, they no longer were enough to make me orgasm. I couldn't reach climax looking at a picture of foot anymore.  I needed more.  By this time I had thousands of pictures that I had saved.

Every now and then, while I was browsing, I'd save a picture.  But it occurred to me very recently that I hadn't actually opened the folder of pictures in over three years.  And that is when I decided I wasn't going to do this to myself anymore.  I deleted it.  All 9000+ pictures.

I still find feet attractive but I had become a creep with a folder full of feet...feet that couldn't even make me reach orgasm.  And I don't want to be that person anymore.  I need to change.

I've moved over to Canada a few years ago and have had a healthy relationship for the last six months.  My girlfriend knows her feet turn me on but she never knew about my collection...and I hope she never does.

I love to watch her bathe. One time I was laying in bed masturbating, and she came into the room and bathed herself on the end of the bed. That was the first time I masturbated to my cat. Currently we both consensually participate in a form of sex. Obviously I can't actually fuck a cat, so the way we do it is I lay on the bed and shake a tin rattle, and she comes in, hops up on the bed and lays on the pillow curled right up next to my face, and basically she purrs/cleans herself while I bury my face in her fur and sometimes lick her nipples while I masturbate. 

It is a very intimate sort of thing, and its obvious we both enjoy it otherwise she wouldn't respond to the rattle. Sometimes she doesn't, but not often. We usually do this a couple times a week to a couple times a day. 

We also eat together, as in she sits on the dining table and eats her food while I eat mine. I sometimes even make food fresh for the both of us (cat food recipes are easy to find). We're pretty much always together, she will even ride in a large purse when we go out.

I truly do love her, and I consider myself to be in a sort of almost-relationship that's better than many traditional ones, and more satisfying than any I've had before. 

My cat is 5  years old, and her name is Wednesday.

It only just came to my mind how much it bothers me that I don't have a normal relationship with my only sibling. My ex boyfriend's sister posted a huge ass letter to his facebook wall for his birthday detailing how much of a great brother he is and how amazing their relationship is. I can't lie to myself- I'm fucking jealous. 

I hate that my sister is disabled. It's not terrible like, spina bifida or something. My mother never told me what she had; she would always just say 'an intellectual disability'. Over the years I've gathered that it's some form of autism, seeing as she has issues with communicating with people and reacting normally in social situations. I know she can't help it, and my parents have always been on my case for not being nicer to her. I simply do not have the patience for her. I hate her voice. Everytime she comes in and says hello I instantly become infuriated for no good reason other than the fact she is there. She's my sister but I don't talk to her at all if I can help it. When I was younger (she's seven years older) we played games and shared rooms even, but as I grew older I grew this huge intolerance to her. I feel bad, but I don't feel like I can do anything about it.

I wish she was normal. I just fucking wish I had a normal sister that I could talk to about things. I've basically grown up as an only child because I isolate myself from her as much as I can. If she was normal I'd be able to do all the fucking things that everyone else does with their older siblings. Have secrets from our parents, hang out, whatever. But I never have and never will fucking have that because she isn't even capable of being an independant human being.

That's the next part. When my parents die, I'll be the only family she has. I don't want to be left with a fucking burden that I never asked for. I don't want to look after an adult child for the rest of my life. It's not fucking fair. Why wasn't she just fucking born normal? I don't have patience for disabled people, and it sounds really awful, but I just don't. I can't stand being around them. I feel uncomfortable and uneasy. You'd think that because I grew up with her my whole life that I'd have this great compassion towards disabled people but it's the exact opposite. She frustrates me more than anyone else I know. 

I just wish she was normal.

Then we moved here. It's this small, southern town and most people are black. Especially at the school since most of the white kids go to private school.

I haven't met one decent black person. They all call me white boy and I've been jumped twice in the three months I've been here. They're ignorant and disrupt the classroom. I am scared to be in a hall or room alone with them. They're more animals than people. Kids in my class openly announce their dream of dealing drugs or having illegitimate kids.

I just assumed this is the place to confess something I have only told my boyfriend about.

Background:  It was this year, around September/October, and I am 17. At this time I was having a 'thing' (afraid of dating) a previous person. I am a very honest person, I have never intentionally cheated on someone before, I keep everything as honest as possible and do not by any means like to bullshit. I am a friendly person, and I am also not the type of person to sleep around, I am just an average normal teenage girl. 

I had this group of friends I had actally started hanging out with this year. I dont typically have a lot of friends, but i try to not be constantly alone. These people also were friends with the boyfriend I had, especially this specific one I used to like, but never persued anything with. We'll call him 'Joe'. Joe was very interesting, he can be a complete asshole but he can also be really nice and act like he cares about you. I enjoyed hanging out with Joe and everyone else in the group, so i continued to. We would go to their house, to mine, smoke, talk, just hangout like normal friends, never anything sexual with those people. Joe was also a good friend of mine because he was almost betfriends with my 'boyfriend'. He also knew I had a lot of emotional issues from being taken advantage of sexually, emotionally, and physically in past relationships. 

One day I went with Joe after school to his house, we were waiting for our other friend to come over and his roomate to come home, which should have take only 10 minutes. We were sitting in his room, and he said he wanted to cuddle, naturally I wasnt an asshole about it and polietely said ""no, I dont think we should"". He said ""Yes we should, lay down"" And he pulled me down. I dealt with it for a second becasue I also know him to be the type of person to force what he wants in every situation, including sexual. Laying there next to him, he turns his tv on and we begin to talk about the show that he has been watching frequently. He turns it on and tries to cuddle with me. I make him stop becasue he gets a little touchy. 

It was almost like an instintanious strip, he just super fast took his pants off under his blanket, then moved it. I obviously had no intention of anything sexual going on, but he clearly did. He moved the blanket and grabbed my hand, I asked ""what are you doing?"" and he said ""Come on, touch it, it's so big, isn't it?"" I told him ""Stop I don't want to, I really don't want to"" after he takes me hand he moves it too his penis and makes me touch it for about 2 minutes while making me kiss him, I keep saying to him ""No stop"", and all he can say is ""You know you like it, look how big it is, dont act like you dont like it"", I let it happen for the solid purpose of being afraid of being, well, raped. I yank my hand as hard as I can away from him, afraid he is going to make me do something, I get up and run to the bathroom to cry. When I come back his roomate has gotten home, so I text him and ask him to smoke with me.
 
I go to the same school as him, I see him every day of my life, and I have finally told him I dont want to be his friend. I have never told a single person at my school or anyone of my friend who does know him or even slept with him. I am ashamed that I let myself let this person take advantage of my friendship, and my emotional issues.

So yesterday at like the asscrack of dawn, I set out for Tennessee. Finally. After freaking out about it to tens of thousands of people, and pacing around my apartment for two days, I drove. 

This part of the story is actually pretty boring, because road trips by yourself are pretty boring. I sing to the radio pretty much non-stop, in case you find that entertaining. I stopped off about eleven o'clock, grabbed a fast food lunch, and slept for six hours in a motel room because I was tired as hell. Woke up just before six, which was actually a really dumb thing to do because it put me right into Friday rush hour traffic. 

I texted Nick when I stopped for gas and told him where I was. I was half afraid he regained his senses from the night before and wasn't going to respond. He texted right back though (was still flipping out a little every time the phone vibrated) and told me to text him when he got to town. I told him it was going to be really late, and he said it didn't matter. 

[The texting itself I didn't feel weird about, we've always texted more than we've had telephone conversations, so I don't feel like he was trying to hold me at arm's length that way or anything.]

After many many hours, I finally made it into town at about a quarter to one. I texted him again and told him I was back, and he told me to come on over. 

I've gotta say, this was the point that I was most nervous during the entire thing – seeing him for the first time after two years. His place is out in the middle of nowhere—I passed sleeping horses on either side of the road, and I had to drive slow because it's gravel in some places. 

Finally I got to his double-wide trailer. You can laugh or make trailer trash jokes, but the last time I saw that place it was nice inside, and this time it was even nicer. I winced as I drove up the drive because the dogs (two – somewhere along the way he must have gotten a second one) came flying out of the dog door and were barking/following the car all the way from the gate. This makes me super nervous because I just KNOW that I'm going to run over one of these stupid fucking dogs right in front of Nick, and that will be the first time he sees me after two years. Turning one of his dogs into a road waffle.  

Luckily, that didn't happen. They're redneck country dogs and they know how to stay out of the way of moving cars in driveways. And then Nick opened the door. 

I just realized this entire time I've been posting to Reddit about this that I haven't even described him, not a single time. It wasn't deliberate though, it's just that I never thought about it. He's been accused of looking like a scruffy Paul Rudd (okay, I've accused him of looking like a scruffy Paul Rudd). He has dark brown hair that he's let grow out since the last time I seen him, down to his collar...except he wasn't wearing a collar. He wasn't wearing anything but a pair of hospital scrubs as pajama pants. And he has dark gray eyes. I've never seen anybody else with eyes like that. He was looking at me completely neutral and leaning up against the post of the front porch as I got out of the car and petted the dogs enough to get them out of my way.  

I walked up to him without getting my bag or anything. I opened my mouth to talk and that's when he walked forward and locked his arms around me, hard. And at that point I just start bawling like a little kid that's been lost for days, I couldn't help it. I couldn't say anything, certainly not any of the suave opening lines I'd been planning out for the past thirteen plus hours. Very uncool. 

To Nick's credit, it would have been very uncool on his part to punch me out in such a pathetic state, even if that was his first inclination. So instead he just held and hushed me while I dialed back the waterworks. With anybody else, I would have been embarrassed, but right then I wasn't. Finally I drew back from him and he kind of nodded towards the house and told me he would get my bag. 

So I open the screen door and the regular door, and go inside. Pretty much looks a lot like the last time I saw it, except for the TV (he didn't have a TV before). Otherwise his house looks like the place of somebody who secretly wants to live in a library. It kind of drives me nuts, but what can I say? I read anything, especially when someone leaves it laying around on the coffee table, the night stands, the floor, or the counter. Don't even get me started on the books, they've become their own form of furniture. It's clean otherwise though, and I love it.   

He followed me in with the dogs and my backpack and I was feeling pretty hangfaced at this point, just wore out of driving and embarrassed now for crying, afterwards. 

“Go to bed,” he says. What am I going to do, argue to sleep on the couch? But I can tell by the way he's looking at me that he wasn't joking, he really is furious, and the only thing keeping me from catching hell was the fact that I must have just looked so miserable and tired he would have felt like a bastard for laying into me. 

So I go back to the bedroom and he follows me, putting my bag over in the corner next to the nightstand. I shuck out of my clothes and curl up under the sheets. He had been sitting up in bed reading a book and waiting for me. He closes the dogs out of the room and then gets in on the opposite side of the bed, though he lies down on his back looking up at the ceiling with his hands behind his head and I'm lying on my side looking at him. No streetlights, so once he turns the side lamp off when we're both in bed I can't really see his face. 

**Me:** I'm so sorry.

**Nick:** I can tell. (I can't really read his voice that well either. It's kind of weird and flat and it's worrying me, even after the hug.)

**Me:** I never wanted to hurt you. (My voice was breaking bad here, it was really hard to get out. That room felt so. damned. quiet. Even the dogs were being quiet.)

**Nick:** Yeah, well, you did. Go to sleep. We'll talk about it in the morning.

At this point, the calm is scaring me a lot. I would rather be screamed at than to hear him talk like that, because it made me feel like he didn't feel anything for me. He said he was fucking furious but this new affect was like he didn't care at all. 

**Me:** I love you. 

At first he didn't answer, and that really was a low point for me. I rolled over away from him on the bed and tried real hard not to cry again. After what felt like a long time (it was really only a couple of seconds) he rolled over towards me and curled up against my back, putting his arm around my waist.

**Nick:** I know. I love you too. That's why you're here. 

I *did* start crying again then, and trying to apologize again, but he just shushed me. I fell asleep with him whispering, “It's okay, Tobias” in my ear. And that is the first time I've fallen asleep in anyone's arms in almost two years. 

**TL;DR** Sexy times were not had, sadly. I doubt anyone is really that surprised. But comforting cuddles were. And sometimes just sleeping with your head in the crook of someone's shoulder is a lot better. 

**Moral of the story:** Real life returns-from-exile are not nearly as cool as they are in the movies. They hurt. A fucking lot. Also, riding off into the sunset *not* encouraged. 

Thank you everybody who supported me and gave me advice from my very first confession. I don't think it's going to be easy for us to completely repair our relationship, and we have a lot to talk about, but I think we're on our way to being better. 

And he loves me back. So there's that.

Oh yeah, and **AMA,** just to cover anything I might have missed. Some of you guys helped me get back together with the love of my life, so I think you deserve to ask me what you want. 

PS: I'm going to write up what we talked about in another update, but I'm still processing it (plus I kind of don't want Nick to catch me writing it either, was pushing my luck on that earlier). I'm emotionally drained from the whole thing.

*First some Background*

Being the only tech literate person in my group of friends I usually get asked to solve the majority of the tech related questions. Now many of my friends are idiots, but this stands out to me. This friend got drunk and left her computer sitting on her bed all night, it overheated and wreaked the hard drive. She brought it to me when it wouldn't turn on and being the nice guy I am I took it with me to fix it. I swapped the hard drives with one of my own spare parts and re-installed windows and office onto her computer.

Once I gave it back to her two days later she didn't say thank you and actually complained about me taking too long. I was taken aback by this and just sort of ended the conversation and left. 

*Here's what happened next*

After fiddling with the hard drive I found it wasn't completely destroyed and still had her thesis on it along with all her research. Of course there was no back up to this anywhere. So she was understandably still pissed about losing it and maybe thats why the anger and frustration was coming out at me. But I told her I could get the files back but I needed a special program that cost $200, she said ok and is getting the money to me soon. To myself I promised that if she said ""thank you"" just once, then I would tell her that I got the information off with a different program that was free.

Let's call him David. 

David= Jock. To. the. max. The baseball cap wearing, sport watching, beer pong playing, muscle car driving, abercrombie and fitch wardrobe country white boy. 

Me= out gay kid from the city who was pretty ""straight acting,"" but I was out.

So, when it first started we had been living together for two years (one year in the dorm on the same floor and one year in a house we shared with 5 other friends). We were friends with everyone, and frankly him and I weren't that close before it happened. 

One night I had requested help to move some stuff down into the basement. My bedroom was on the second floor, and everyone in the house was pretty drunk, David and myself included. He lived in the attic and helped me move stuff for about an hour. I just had to get it done, and frankly there was rarely a sober moment during my undergrad career. 

After we moved everything downstairs I rolled a joint for David and I as a method of saying thanks for all the help. He wanted another one so he asked me up to his room. 

He put on an episode of ""Clone High"" (remember that TV show) and we both sat on the bed. He started to play the guitar and we started to drink. I had been out for years, so he knew I was gay, and I knew he was in a relationship, and had been for about 2 years.

We drank and talked for about an hour, and that's when it happened.

Out of nowhere David moved closer to me and put his hand on my hand. I just looked into his beautiful brown eyes and frankly was a bit scared. I was still naive to the fact that straight boys experiment, and thought he was joking around. He looked me straight in the eyes and told me that he had always wanted to fuck me. I was shocked and pulled my hand away. 

He stood up, mostly out of fright I imagine, and just looked down at me on the bed. I was avoiding eye contact and just asked if he was being serious. I didn't know how to react. I could hear the blood rushing through my ears, and frankly I was at half-mast at this point; the erection was noticible though my track pants. 

David just stood there and said nothing, he just looked at me for about 10 seconds (which felt like an eternity) and said, ""take off your pants."" 

I don't know if it was the drink, or the pot, or the 2am physical labour, or whatever it was, but I just stood up and took off my pants. He pushed me back onto the bed and mounted me then and there. It was terrifying, and beautiful, all at the same time. 

We fucked for HOURS,taking breaks in between to smoke more pot, and drink more booze. During the breaks we did not talk about what was going on, we just reloaded and fucked somemore. It was a dizzying and non-believeable experience to say the least. 

I finally went back downstairs to my bedroom at 8am and passed out. I slept for 12 hours. I don't know if it was the massive amount of alcohol, the sweaty, heaving, drunken sex, or the massive amount of pot that we smoked, but my body needed to rest. I was awoken by the sound of his girlfriend knocking on his bedroom door, calling up to him and then ascending the stairs to the attic and his bedroom. 

When I woke up, I literally did not believe that we had has sex. I just sat there, at the end of my bed, trying to piece together the night before and attempting to strip fantasy away from reality. It wasn't until I smelled my hands and could still smell him on me that I realized we had fucked. 

He went home to his parents for about a week, and neither one of us made any attempt to reach out to the other. After he came back to our student house, we avoided one another. We didn't talk about anything, we didn't hang out, we didn't even drink together when all of our housemates were getting ready for the bar. Nothing. For 2 weeks. And then one night I got a text.

All it said was, ""Do you want to come upstairs for a joint?"" Now I knew he was in a relationship, I knew that he was straight identified, and I knew that I had to do nothing and let him make the moves. I wanted to fuck him again, and I knew it was wrong, but I didn't care. 

I rapidly texted back, ""OK, I'll be up in 20."" I took a shower, climbed the stairs, and found him, in bed, under the sheets, with the fucking guitar on the bed and clone high on the computer screen. I knew he remembered, and I knew what he wanted to do.

This pattern continued for another 3 years. We would go about our seperate lives, me dating men him dating the same woman, and all the while we were fucking like rabbits. At one point it got to where we would fuck 2-4 times a DAY, even when we were both in relationships. 

We never told anyone about this. His girlfriend was never told, and I never knew who I could tell. We moved out a after undergraduate and continued to fuck though grad school, he became a lawyer, I became a physicist. We fucked for three years, and no one knew.

I lost contact with him after University, our relationship was more sexual than anything else. This was about 3 years ago. 

Yesterday, I opened my mailbox and open the invitation to his wedding to the girlfriend he had all through the time we were fucking. I'm not going, or maybe I will. I'm married now, and I don't know why he invited me. But there we are...one of the dirtiest secrets in my life, laid bare for the internet to see. 

**TL;DR: Fucked my stright housemate for 3 years, and now he invited me to his wedding...to the girlfriend he cheated on with me.**

He was 21, being a senior in high school this was pretty exciting when we started flirting. One day he offered to pick me up on his bike. Of course I said yes. He picked me up and I hopped on, kind of nervous. As soon as he started the engine it hit me-pleasure like I had never felt before. I remember gasping and squeezing my legs as tightly as I could, trying to keep myself from squirming around. He asked if I was okay and I just told him to go. As soon as we got on the freeway I couldn't control myself anymore, I had the most intense orgasm of my life. Sorry to get too vivid but I remember panting, grinding around on the back seat, and soaking through my jeans and being afraid he would think I was crying and had pissed myself in fear. Since then I've been hooked. I start up conversations with pretty much any guy I see with a helmet/bike/or even just a leather jacket in hopes that I can ride his bike and get that feeling again. It's almost ruining my life now though, I feel like all other orgasms are inadequate and that unless he has a bike, I'm not interested. I even masturbate to pictures of guys on motorcycles and sometimes I straddle my washer and close my eyes and pretend I'm on a bike. I don't know how to get myself to enjoy normal sex/masturbation anymore. I've never told anyone/any guys that I've dated. My friends have no idea and think I'm just a wannabe biker chick.

Alright she is allowed to have her opinion, but really I have no sympathy.

Being an unattractive girl makes you invisible most of the time. People don't really care about my personality unless they have to, like extended contact through classes together or whatever. I am really friendly too, but it's sometimes received with complete coldness because, well, I'm not pretty enough for them. And it's not something I make up in my head, because I see the same people ready to accept pretty girls. Maybe they are just assholes, but it doesn't mean it isn't hurtful and that it doesn't get in the way. 

It's not like it's just me or this isn't a well known phenomenon. My friend was pretty unattractive until she lost a lot of weight. People were straight up dismissive of her. When she got pretty well then everyone wanted to be friends. She was invited places, people wanted her there without even really knowing her.

I feel like no one really wants me around. At parties I just take up space that could be taken up by a pretty girl. 

I have a good personality, I can be a lot of fun, but that doesn't seem to really matter. I work really hard to be friendly and social, and it works I guess, but not without a ton of effort. When people get to know me, they really like me, they want me around and I do cool things and shit like that. People think I am funny and smart and cool and shit, but they assume the opposite it seems upon first seeing me.

And it's not like it's just that I am in the position that all guys are in. People like to make that claim. But guys aren't invisible. Even unattractive guys, it's ok because they are all fellow bros and shit. Often they end up with girls far more attractive than them because of their personalities, and I rarely see the opposite. If they even put in minimal effort, I can see it's received better than the effort I put in.

I don't even want to be pretty or wanted sexually. I mean I do, but that's not my primary concern. I just want to not be treated like furniture.

This bitterness takes a toll on my friendliness. I'm not always like this, and it's embarrassing when I am, but I can't help it sometime. Most of the time I let it roll off my back. But I feel like society is always sending me the message that the only way for me to be worthwhile as a girl is to be pretty.

I don't know why I'm even posting this. I guess when you don't have a real friend in the world, you turn to strangers to get things off your chest... but I'm also scared to open up, even anonymously like this. Please, if you're going to write a comment making fun of me, have some fucking mercy. I am broken enough.. =\

I guess I'll start at the start. I was born in January 1991 to 2 junkie parents. (intravenous heroin users). My grandmother has passed and my grandfather has never cared to meet me.

My mom quit drugs, and smoking and drinking, while she was pregnant but literally 2 months after I was born she was on drugs again.

When I was 2, my mom left my dad when he threw a stick of butter
at my face because I wouldn't shut up, and found out he had deafened a child by pressing his thumb into his ear canal, also because he wouldn't be quiet.

So, she left him and started dating another heroin addict, who became my step-dad. He hates me. All growing up, he told me how I was fat and worthless (much skinnier now, drugs will do that..but also clean now, just FYI) and when my mom wasn't around he would kick me over and over again in the legs and ass. My dad literally kicked my ass, for years. I'm sitting here in tears wondering why the fuck he couldn't even TRY to love me... I told him so many times I just wanted to make my dad proud.. but he was quick to remind me he was not my dad, just my step-dad who was fucking my mom, and I just ""came with the territory, kid"". 

He never once told me he loved me. I don't think anyone ever has... my mom probably did when I was a baby. but I don't remember..

I have 2 step siblings, both my step-dad's children, and neither one of them lived with us or were raised by him (both raised by their respective mothers). They don't hate me but they don't love me. They might come to my funeral if they were in the state already, maybe...

But I eventually moved out on my own.

um. what else..

I fell in love once. I fell so deeply in love with a girl named Hannah, that to this day a part of me is convinced that I loved her more than any person has ever loved any other person in the history of humanity.
My heart aches violently just thinking about her. I told her of my affection, and she played me like a Grandmaster plays chess. She would feign affection in me to get me to do things for her, fawn over her every step and deed, and buy her anything her heart desired. I did it *so fucking willingly*. Ugh, I am a tool. I confess to her that I'm completely in love... and valentine's day was coming up. I asked her on a date. My very first date. SHE SAID YES.

So of course, I did what any rational guy would do for a casual valentine's dinner/first date.

I went and bought a $1,200 diamond necklace. I reserved an entire section of a restaurant and had them clear the tables except for 2.

ON. VALENTINES. DAY. Do you know how much that cost me? As much as the fucking necklace nearly. My aunt owned the restaurant which is the only reason it was even a remote possibility. (and no, for the record, my aunt doesn't love me.)

So. I drive to pick up Hannah. I'm already shaking so bad I can barely drive, so I pull over, cry for a minute because I finally know what ""happy"" is, and resume my drive.

I see her standing in her driveway. She looks perfect. Long, black, curly hair down to her chest. White cocktail dress, black shoes. Just... my absolute dream.. come to life. At this point I'm *literally* starting to rethink my atheism. Thoughts like ""there is no possible way that evolved. That woman was created in the mind of a beautiful divine being, and manifested just for me."" and ""this angel is my reward for waiting so patiently and dutifully for love"" were crossing my mind. Crazy thoughts. Crazy, beautiful thoughts that I wish to feel again one day.

We drive to the restaurant, take our seats, she's amazed at how we've got the section to ourselves. She's blushing. I'm blushing. 

Our waitress brings our menus, Hannah orders a porterhouse steak (My kinda girl! See what I mean?) and I order the same.

We're sitting there, and I just start pouring my heart out like an idiot.
She knows I'm in love with her, we've discussed it. But I had never said it. So I said it.

(paraphrasing here) ""I love you, Hannah. Don't say it back, I know it's not mutual but I hope it can be some day. You're everything I've ever hoped for in another human. I would do anything in this world for you. I wanted to wait until after dinner but I wont be able to eat if I don't give you this now""

and I gave her the necklace. She cried. She put it on. She went to the bathroom, cried some more, came back, and... put the necklace in front of me.

(paraphrasing here) she said ""iamreallylonely, I am so sorry... I can't take this, this is too much. I have to confess something to you and I really don't want to break your heart... I only said yes to this date because you said you were in love with me and I've been so lonely, and it was valentines day... but I can't see us being more than friends"".

I can't really tell you how the rest of the night went, it was a blur.
A knife-in-the-heart-slowly-being-spun, quick painful blur.

The next day I tried to kill myself by taking a lot of aspirin. I know, I'm a pussy. But it's not like it's a selfish act if there's nobodys life who would be affected right? That was my reasoning anyway.

Obviously I didn't die. I can't even kill myself right... FUCK.

But the fact that I had tried, and *could* have died scared me so bad that I didn't try again.

I don't want to die... I just... don't want to live a lonely life of sadness and misery and insignificance. I don't want to continue being this monster... a monster made of love, bursting at the seams with it, ready to pour it into the heart of anyone who would return it... but never finding someone.

Death isn't the answer, and deep down I have to believe that as long as I don't lose the fire in my heart, and the desire to find some girl to love truly, then I *will* find her one day.

But as of yet... nobody has ever loved me, that I know of.

Don't downvote my replies just because you disagree. I'd like to at least think I've spent some time proofreading them.**

I'm a male in my early twenties, still in college. And before anyone freaks out I'm not going to go out and rape a kid. Seriously, gay people don't go around raping men, straight people don't go around raping women. Why the fuck does everyone think paedophiles are going to go crazy and rape the first kid who looks cute? By the way, I'm gay.

I've been this way for a while. No parental abuse, no early childhood molestation. In high school I kept wondering why other kids could find adults attractive. I waited for myself to start being attracted to older people, but it never really happened. Now I'm almost done with college and after several failed relationships with people my own age I'm pretty much ready to give up. I'm tired of not letting my partners down. I'm tired of not feeling the same way back. Jesus...when we have sex I can't even cum without fantasizing about younger people.

**--- Edited out my arguments ""in favor"" that's not the point of this post. Maybe I would be a lot less depressed if I agreed that paedophilla was inherently wrong. ---**

My sister knows. I'm set up to get ""help"". I'm so fucking tired of people saying ""help"" is the solution. As if people have any idea what ""help"" entails. Am I going to discover that I'm actually attracted to people my age and my attraction to kids is part of a traumatic childhood I don't remember? Maybe I'll be told that I just have to develop ""coping mechanisms"" for dealing with the fact that I'll never be able to get into the kind of relationship I want to be in. Or maybe I'll go through some therapy to convert me to a more normal sexuality. The same kind that homosexuals of the past were forced through.

And you know what the worst part about this is? More than the fear, and the paranoia and the chronic anxiety, it's the fact that I can't even trust my own judgment anymore. I have tried, so hard, to convince myself that having sex with kids is inherently wrong, but I really can't. It doesn't make sense to me that having an orgasm would be fundamentally detrimental, and I think that anything beyond that is a factor of culture and society. But who the fuck am I to say that? I'm probably wrong anyway, after all, 99% of the rest of the world disagrees. I see people on Stormfront talk openly about the superiority of caucasians. I see religious people openly talk about how they KNOW god exits. All these groups of people are so sure of themselves...maybe I'm just as delusional as they are.

But it really doesn't matter. Because as I said, I wouldn't want to get into a relationship with a kid at this point anyway. And really I don't care if I'm right or wrong or why I feel this way. Because at the end of the day I'm still in the same position. Maybe in a 100 years people will look back and wonder why everyone hated paedophiles. Or maybe someone will invent a pure that cures paedophila and no one will have to deal with it anymore.

In any case, none of that's going to happen in my life time. As far as I can see it there's only one way out. And I think we both know what that is.

**--- EDIT: Apparently my reply has been downvoted into the negative. So I'll post it here. ---**

I guess I should probably state my opinion on sexuality in general and see if anyone can convince me otherwise. When I said that I didn't think having sex with a child was inherently wrong, I meant it. But I didn't mean that having sex with a kid doesn't cause damage in practice.

For the time being I'm going to ignore arguments about pregnancy and STDs because they don't apply in my situation anyway and because I don't believe that paedophilla can be rejected solely because of them.

I can always remember thinking that contemporary views of sexuality were warped. Even as a kid I didn't like not being able to talk about sex. I had all these questions (like most kids do) but I was too embarrassed and ashamed to ask them. Later on I learned that there are appropriate times and places for those questions. I still don't know why talking about sexuality ever need be “inappropriate.”

Public nudity is something that still bothers me a lot. Why would it be illegal to walk around naked, in your natural state of being? Is there something inherently damaging about seeing another persons genitals? I could still be arrested and put on a sex offenders list for it. Situations like that scream hysteria at me, and I don't see how anyone can tell me with a straight face that constantly covering your body around other people is “healthy.”

I see a lot of of people tell me that being molested as a child is awful. I agree. It's fucking horrible. And I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry that kids are abused or exploited or put in a position they don't want to be. I'm sorry that it's embarrassing or awkward or just plain painful to talk about. And I'm sorry there wasn't anyone around to stop it because if I was there I would and there's no excuse for ignoring something like that.

However, I don't think that all sexual experiences at a young age are necessarily rape. I know that's hard to hear, and I'm about to argue that even seemingly consensual sexual experiences can cause damage, but let's be honest. Not all childhood sexual experiences are rape. You could argue that they all technically are, and I guess legally that's true, but practically speaking they are not.

I know people. Several people. In real life. They've had sex with adults at ages as young as twelve and they don't regret it. Again, I'm not saying this is the norm. But I'm not going to submit to the argument that having sex with a kid is always rape. It may be irresponsible and dangerous. But the other party doesn't always regret it.

I feel like the main argument that children can't consent to sex fails because sex shouldn't be something that requires responsibility. I think that in contemporary society we always associate sexuality with a certain kind of commitment (at least some) and responsibility and I don't think that has to be the case. I think that sex can just be an expression of love or even just pleasure.

Let's paint a picture. What if you grew up in an alternate universe where sexuality was completely liberated? (Again, ignoring pregnancy and STDs) What if people walked could around naked and no one would care. Kids were taught at a young age about sex, how to have sex, and to say no. Do you really think that sexual experiences, even unpleasant ones, would hold the same emotional baggage?

We teach kids from a young age to cover their bodies under clothing. We purposely hide sexuality from them until they're “old enough” to understand it. I don't think this is healthy. I don't think this is ethical. And I think that it causes a lot of questions and emotional issues for the majority of people growing up. Especially when they get into their first sexual experience.

The idea that sexuality is destroys a child's innocence is ridiculous in my opinion. We shouldn't hide sex with children. And in an ideal world it wouldn't matter if I fucked a kid or not because sex wouldn't be taken that seriously. It would be seen as a normal urge to explore and have fun with and not suppressed while at the same time obsessed with like it is today.

But you know what? It doesn't matter. Because I don't live in that kind of world. And the people who argue against paedophilla are right. Having sexual experiences at a young age will fuck you up. Can you imagine being in that position? Someone touching you in a place where you were taught your whole life shouldn't be touched. Not knowing what is happening or why you're feeling funny and being too scared and embarrassed to tell the other person to stop.

Even if you're older. Let's say 14. And you want to have sex with another person. Is it worth it to deal with the pressure? Not being able to tell anyone. Not knowing whether what you did was right or if you're really just fucked up and you don't realize it yet. Not knowing whether you fucked up the other person.

When society makes something damaging, that isn't really damaging, they still cause real damage. I am confident that if we lived in a world where kids were taught about sex and how to say no, we wouldn't have nearly as many child molesters running around. I'm not arguing that such a society will ever appear. And I'm not saying that it would be some sort of Utopia. But I do think that our current views of sexuality are completely skewed.

So now I live in this society where I can't have relationships with the kids I want to, not because the relationship itself is wrong, but because in an attempt to protect children they end up doing more harm than I did. But I'd be just as responsible, because I enabled it to happen.

I do feel a little dirty about it.

I have an early January birthday, so most people I'm close enough to exchange gifts with for Christmas/Birthday usually spend a little bit more than they normally would at Christmas for a combo gift. My grandparents decided to get me a $50 Spencers giftcard and a charm for the bracelet they've been adding to for years. I was over the moon about the charm. It's a well loved tradition between my grandma and I. But I digress. 

I'm not sure what possessed them to get a giftcard from Spencers. All I can imagine is my grandma wandering around the mall doing her shopping, getting her power walk on and killing two birds with one stone. I imagine she's a little lost as to what the hip young crowd is into these days. Didn't she get me a Bath and Bodywork's basket last year? That's no good. Too thoughtless. Maybe a nice blouse. No, she always buys one size too big. Not that *that* wouldn't be a problem if I came for dinner more often. And what if what she buys something that I think is too 'old' looking? 

Then in the corner of her eye she spots it. The neon rainbow sign, glowing through the dull florescent haze. The lettering is funky and bright. It's *perfect* for a 22 year old. 

They keep the racy stuff in back, and I highly doubt she wandered that far in. I imagine she looked around a bit, taking in the groovy lava lamps, shot glasses with obnoxious phrases, and all the Playboy Bunny paraphernalia. She balked at the racks misogynist t-shirts and cheap plastic fart machines, but if this is what the kids are into...

I accepted the giftcard with big smiles and thank yous because I'm not an asshole, but it sat around for a while because I was unsure what the hell I was going to use it on. Eventually I ended up on the stores website. Fifty bucks is still fifty bucks, man.

I debated wasting it on an Adventure Time onesie I would never wear and some lame drinking accessories. Maybe some band tees, but that's not really my style. Ohh maybe trashy lingerie. But it's all so ugly, and the money is from my *grandparents*. Then I ventured into 'toys'. 

For the unaware, sex toys can be fucking expensive. I had a decent $15 dollar one that recently broke. It was a dark day for a single lady that's not into casual sex. Personally, I could never really justify dropping much more than that on a vibrator when old cheap reliable got the job done. But then there was a $40 dollar rabbit with glowing reviews. I even had enough on the card to cover shipping and handling. 

So thanks Grandma. $50 spent well.

All he wanted was to ""be my friend""

I stayed away and moved on. I improved my life and looked back and saw how awful and sick the whole thing really was. I still felt bad. No matter how hard I looked at how horrible he was to me, I still felt guilty and awful for him. I thought about him all the time and staying away was hard.

When he wouldn't stop it became creepy and annoying, then a little scary. Overtime I grew to hate him. Every ounce of pity I had for him vanished. Every bit of me that felt bad for him or for his family and for his situation went away completely. I hate him. I can't stand him, have no warm feelings whatsoever for him at all. 

I am happy he harassed me because he pushed me so far that I could never pity him ever again. He's a sick human being and gets what he deserves for how he behaves.

1360325724.0,271,self.confession,184lxm,I abandoned my best friend of seven years (and all my other friends) by changing my number without telling them and moving out of state without saying where I was going. No warning.,371,100,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/184lxm/i_abandoned_my_best_friend_of_seven_years_and_all/,"I was closer to him than anyone in the world, we were practically telepathic when we were together, like twins separated at birth. We could sit for hours in a comfortable silence with no reason to speak. He could be in pain hundreds of miles away and I would know about it. We also lived together almost three years. We were inseparable in college (met our freshman year) but we spent the next five years dating separate people and making each other batshit jealous - on purpose, really, I guess each of us trying to force the other one into taking a stand on our relationship. 

We also drove across the country together, just the two of us. Throughout our friendship (starting maybe a year and a half into it) we made out every once in awhile and fooled around. Several times a year it would just sort of happen without any rhyme or reason, but it never went much further than that because I wouldn't let it - I didn't know what we thought we were doing to begin with, I was raised in the rural South and didn't have any kind of experience with that kind of thing. The first time he made a pass at me, I thought he was gonna fight me. It was definitely the hottest sex I've ever had though, completely different than girls obviously but also different because it was *him*. It was passionate but it was tender too, it wasn't like anything I'd experienced before. We never really talked about it, it was just an accepted part of our relationship, and it did get more and more intense the longer it went on. We never ""dated"" or anything, we didn't consider ourselves queer, we were just always together and it worked. And we both slept off and on with women during college at this point but it was just Saturday night sport. We used women for casual drunken sex and then withheld intimacy from them because we were only willing to give it to each other. 

The last time we were together he came up behind me while I was washing dishes at the sink and just put his arms around me and put his lips against the back of my neck. It was the first intimate contact we'd had in weeks. I hadn't been with anyone else almost two years at that point. It was after a dinner where two of our friends were engaged and getting ready to be married, so of course that's all they could talk about. He waited until everyone left to be able to touch me, and that made me feel angry and sad like it never had before, even though we were so used to it by then.

And that was the last night that I saw him. He wanted me to stay the night and I did - a day or so later I turned my phone off and left town. 

The last words on the last phone message I ever got from him, before I changed my number: 

""Please call me, I love you."" It was so plaintive, the sound of his voice like that almost made me call him back right then, but I didn't. 

I cut off my other mutual friends for the simple reason that they would want to know why I did it and I didn't want my friend to feel like I was abandoning just him...so I abandoned all of them. I figured at least they would be there to catch him that way and they could commiserate together on what a coldhearted bastard I was for running out on everyone. 

But it really wasn't like that though. I just couldn't explain to them why the feelings between us scared me so bad. They didn't know anything about the real way me and my friend felt about each other. It was a secret and only one of our roommates suspected because he caught us kissing once in college. (And that did [not go well.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/184lxm/i_abandoned_my_best_friend_of_seven_years_and_all/c8bs3pm))

I couldn't explain. So I left instead. 

This happened about two years ago, a little bit less.

**EDIT:** As for everyone asking me why I did it, it's very complicated but the short answer is that we love each other and we can't be together for various reasons. I go into some of those reasons in the comments here and over at /r/lgbt

**EDIT2:** We are both guys (26 years old) and no, I haven't been with any other guys, and I was only with girls before him, and I haven't been with anybody since.

**EDIT3:** Yes, I *am* a massive chickenshit and a selfish bastard. Hence the throwaway account and the running away halfway across the country without telling anybody to avoid secret awkward best friend bromance.

**EDIT4:** Thanks for all the comments and questions, it feels good to confess it to somebody. My family thinks I moved for a job. I've tried to elaborate on my story a little bit so people understand more where I'm coming from and why I did what I did.

I ran over nine hundred miles away because I'm afraid to let him love me the way I love him. I did the most cruel thing I could think of to drive him away.

I started dating her years ago after meeting online, and honestly she was pretty much perfect. Everything I wanted. Brilliant personality, funny, accepting of me and my flaws and my past and how I was just your average jobless nerd who stayed inside playing video games constantly. I couldn't believe my luck in finding her. We lived a couple of hundred miles away from each other, but saw each other as much as we could sometimes spending a month or so together, and the rest of the time we'd talk all day and play games online. MMOs, multiplayer games.. I never got tired of talking to her and I couldn't believe it but she actually seemed to adore me. 

She suffered from low confidence at first mainly to do with her weight. She was obese. I didn't mind this at all.. I thought her body was genuinely beautiful. I've always liked bigger girls anyway, but she was just gorgeous. She still had womanly curves, beautiful face.. I found her beautiful and told her so whenever I could. I didn't care that she was fat. I didn't fucking care. Not only that but I knew she took good care of herself.. the times I stayed with her, I saw her health was good, definitely not as greedy as me (I've always been skinny) and ate better.. So yeah, in no way did I care about her weight. I'd reassure her, always remind her that I thought she was beautiful, point out that her lifestyle wasn't shit and that perhaps some people are just fat.. that she should remember that as long as shes happy with how she lives, she shouldn't hate herself. Eventually she began to believe me and it was the most awesome thing. She'd send me pictures of her wearing new prettier clothes instead of loose ones as her confidence went up, she'd thank me for helping her and reassuring her. Things were perfect then. I was so in love with her.. I was motivated to get a job, take care of her, get a house, a family.. All because of her. Eventually I proposed. She said yes. I still remember that day.. she said yes and we danced around her kitchen and she was laughing and smiling. Fuck, I'm crying. I fucked everything up.

Quite soon after I proposed to her, I got an email from an ex. THE ex. The one that always plays on your fucking mind. Except she wasnt really an ex.. we never dated. But for years (I also met her online when I was much younger, but we had mutual friends so met face to face a few times) I was hung up on her. She said she was in love with me too, for years.. but she always seemed to 'fall' into dating somebody else.. we'd 'lose contact' for a few months and then regain it, and she'd be dating someone. This happened so much. She said she still loved me, I'd still be hung up on her.. give her attention and affection and love, sometimes when she already had another boyfriend.. Yeah I'm a fucking idiot. Eventually she disappeared completely. I was pretty distraught by her disappearance, but slowly got over it and a couple of years later I met my girlfriend... so yeah.

But she had emailed me now. How she missed me. She was single, thinking about me, wondered if I remembered her from those years ago. Still in love with me. We started talking. Reminiscing. Long story short she drew me in again.. eventually admitted she had heard I was engaged and was so desperate for me she wanted to see if her and I could finally get together. Do it for real this time, that she wanted me, we should make a go of it, break up with my fiancee.

I'd like to say I hesitated. I wish I fucking had.. but it was THAT ex and she was saying all these things. 4 months after proposing to my girlfriend, I broke it off. I couldn't face her so I did it by email and never spoke to her again.. I felt so guilty but I just couldn't face her as I knew it was so out of the blue for her. I broke up with her by email after three years together and didn't even give her a reason. I told her I had lost feelings.

I told the ex I was single again, she seemed elated. Emailing me, messaging me, we planned to meet up and 'get things going', talk about our relationship face to face. I was so pleased that things had worked out. Then she disappeared for an agonizing two months and came back telling me she was with someone else yet again, not giving a shit about me, and then disappeared again after telling me one night. Havn't spoken to her since. So there you go. 

I was heartbroken and angry, and confused. I wanted to make up for my mistake with my ex-fiancee, get her back, apologize but I couldn't face it. I knew I'd have to explain at some point and I just couldn't. I couldn't bear telling her I had made a mistake after what I did. I did start speaking to her again though, on and off, played games together.. she was still the same person, but distant, and I wanted her so badly I didnt know how to say it.

At one point I was talking to a few friends of mine in a group chat, and one of them was ripping me about how the girl from my past fucked me over. Mocking me about it. I was humiliated I suppose, I didn't want them to know how much it had all effected me so I played the tough guy. One of my friends then said something like 'Well, your fiancee was a fatass anyway, bet you're glad to be rid of her'.. I found myself agreeing, to save face. I joined in on mocking her, said some fucking horrible things about her and her weight. A lot of things. We all did, but I was the worst. I meant none of it. I don't know why I went that far.

What I didn't realise was in the group chat was one of my ex-fiancees friends who kept silent.. and who told my ex-fiancee everything I had said. When I found out (from another friend) I was fucking terrified. I had ruined any chance and not only that, I knew what sort of impact that might have on her after all that time I spent reassuring her (reassurances that I meant). She'd think I had been lying when I wasn't. I wanted to talk to her and tell her it was all bullshit and explain why I said what I said, but again I couldn't. 

She spoke to me less, definitely even more distant but still kind and polite, she always was, she was always so nice and considerate of people.. even still played stuff together sometimes and laughed together, and she never once mentioned it and that killed me. She didn't know that I knew she knew, I suppose. And she was being perfectly nice to me. 

Eventually that contact trailed off, some others that were internet 'buddies' of hers lost contact with her. She didn't come online anymore, her phone was disconnected when I tried to call a couple of times. I was still pining and wanting her but I accepted being alone, got into a routine again. Didn't find anyone else. Just alone in my room. No job, living with my parents, playing games, life gone to shit, no motivation anymore. Fast forward about two years, I get an email from one of her friends, about my ex-fiancee, saying she had died. She was 25.

I got her Moms home number from the friend and rang my ex-fiancees Mom wanting to know what happened. It was horrible, she was crying as soon as she heard my voice.. I felt bad about that but I couldn't leave it, I needed to know what happened.

Apparently my ex-fiancee suddenly started dieting, getting frustrated that nothing was working and it turned into an eating disorder. She was in and out of hospital from passing out and eventually the doctors and her family realized what was going on when it happened so much, especially when she had lost weight, that she was starving herself pretty extremely, eating nothing for days on end. They tried to make her get better her Mom said, but it was like she was terrified of any sort of food. She killed herself, alcohol and drugs which we still don't know where she got them from. She was teetotal up until the moment she killed herself, never so much as took an aspirin either. Apparently there were mounds of diet pills in there that no one knew she had. She left a letter before she did it, which her mom showed me, saying she'd rather die than 'be made to be fat again', that her way was the only way that was working to lose weight because nothing else did and no one listened to her, didn't want to live with everyone trying to make her recover, that being fat made people treat you like hell.. I knew she meant me with that line.

It's been a few months. Her Mom still feels guilty but I know the blame is on me. I just know it. Her mom doesn't know what I did, or said, just that we broke up.. I went to see her and she actually praised me on being so kind to her daughter with the break up, that my ex-fiancee was heartbroken but never had a bad word to say about me, always said how wonderful I was.. that my fiancee respected my decision to break up with her.. never a bad word.. and apparently she had said that she'll always love me. Her mom said 'these things just happen, people fall out of love, I cant blame you for falling out of love. I know you care'. She said those words and its like the whole world blurred as I heard them. She gave me a hug then and I felt sick to my stomach. She didn't know I had caused all this. She didn't know anything and I couldnt tell her. I still can't. She even sent me a christmas card with such nice words in, thanking me for going to see her and remembering her daughter even though we had been broken up for a long time when she died. I couldn't tell her I had been thinking about her every day.

She showed me pictures of my ex-fiancee too from a little while before she died.. she had shrunk so quickly with the eating disorder. She wasn't skinny when she died. Just smaller than she was. Looking ill. I saw pictures of where her hair was patchy and falling out. Pale and bags under the eyes. None of her beautiful smile. I see those pictures every day in my head. I can't take this. I feel like my life is over.

I still love her. She was the best thing that had happened to me and much better than I ever deserved. I love her so, so much.

For the last three years our marriage has been more or less sexless and I have existed on Internet porn pretty much exclusively for my relief. My wife and I still love each other but we have become physically distant and although we have spoken about it she and I haven't really been physically intimate for a very long time.  I don't know the underlying reasons.

This is hard to confess to. For the last two months I have become nearly obssessed with seeing my stepdaughter naked. 

Three nights ago my wife came home exhausted from work and fell asleep on the bed, my stepdaughter being in her bedroom. Within half an hour she went to the bathroom where I heard the shower running. Prior to this I had examined the bathroom door and found that it was slightly warped at the top and offered a view into the bathroom directly onto the shower area. 

I gave her about 2 mins and stood on a chair outside the bathroom door, being as silent as I could. And there she was. Naked in the shower. Her body slim, her dark hair and eyes contrasting against her pale skin. Her breasts were perfect, firm and pointed...and my eyes were always drawn back to the natural dark hair between her legs. It was incredibly sexually exciting. I was nervous as hell, but I could not look away. Eventually nerves got the better of me and I stood down, but I was back within two minutes after I found my wife still fast asleep.

I watched her again for two or three minutes until she finished showering. Her body entranced me as I tried to commit her to memory, my eyes always drawn back between her legs to her most private place. Throughout hr face was entirely neutral and blank - she didn't suspect a single thing. When she turned the shower off I moved away quickly and quietly and went to our other bathroom where I sexually relieved myself quickly.

Afterwards, the post-orgasmic sadless caught hold of me like never before. *I knew what I was doing* - it was no accident. I felt such regret and such overwhelming guilt. But my lust was too much - within an hour I masturbated again, playing the scene of her over in my head again. When I went to bed I could barely sleep for my excitement. 

I have betrayed them both. In silence and without witnesses I have broken the sanctity and safety of my home through a truly *basic* lust I feel towards a young woman who has entirely placed her trust in me for providing a safe place to live. She suspects nothing. My wife suspects nothing. But I have intruded upon her and I will probably do so again.

I'm a foul person.

1365022424.0,269,self.confession,1bm32m,I'm in love with my straight best friend.,350,81,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1bm32m/im_in_love_with_my_straight_best_friend/,"I'm a gay male. My best friend is straight. I've known him since I was a freshman in university, and now we're seniors. Graduate this May. I guess what has sparked me to tell you all this is the fact that, after graduation, there's a very big chance I won't get to see my best friend again. Job offers have been made, and we're going across the country -- me to NYC, and he's going to AZ. 

I love him. It started sophomore year. I just started crushing on him, but never said a word. I've lived in silence for about three years, but it has gotten to the point that I can't handle it. I told him I was gay a few months after we met, and his response was, ""I wish you wouldn't make such a big deal about it. You act like it's something to be ashamed of."" then he gave me a bro-hug, and it was never an issue. He would always ask me what guys I found attractive, etc. Like I was his brother. 

Flash forward to the summer of junior year. It's my birthday, and we're both drunk. Him more than me. Typical shenanigans occurred, and we started talking. He asked me if I was dating anyone (I'm a private person when it comes to that aspect of my life), and I told him no (which was the truth). Then he went on and on about how I deserve the perfect guy, anyone would be lucky to have me, etc. We were at my parents' lake house at the time, and Jake was going to sleep on the floor, but I said he could sleep in the bed with me if he didn't think it'd be too weird. (NOTE: *I had NO ulterior motives planned -- I just didn't think it right he slept on the floor while I had the bed to myself.*) 

Jake laughed and his response was, ""Hell yeah."" He got in with me, and I was asleep almost instantly. About two hours later I woke up to him groping my upper leg. We were in a spooning position, and I could feel his dick pressed up against me. I woke up and looked at him, but he was asleep. He was groping me in his sleep. My heart was racing, and I slept on the couch downstairs after that. 

From that point on, that's when my feelings for him grew stronger and stronger. *More* than a brotherly bond. I got jealous when he dated other women or hit on people, and I tried distancing myself from him for a while, but I couldn't. 

And let's go back to New Year's Eve. I was so fucking drunk at a party that Jake was throwing at his house. I ended up passing out in the bathroom. I woke up in his bed, and he was sitting up beside me, making sure I wouldn't asphyxiate or whatever. I was still pretty drunk, and I assumed he was. I remember looking at him and asking him what time it was, and he just asked me, ""How drunk are you?"" and I laughed and said, ""Pretty drunk."" *Then* he asked me the question I'll never cease to forget: ""*Are you drunk enough to not remember?*"" I just giggled like an idiot because, hello, I downed shot after shot of hard liquor.

Then Jake pulled me up into his lap and just -- cuddled me? I guess that's the word to use. He rubbed my back and just cuddled me. 

Nothing happened after that, though. Jake is a normally touchy-feely guy. It didn't freak me out, except the fact that I liked it too much. There's no one else I can tell. I'm in love with a guy who *is* the perfect guy, and I plan on telling him after we graduate so I can just get it out. Keeping something like this bottled up inside fucking hurts.

Early in the relationship we had a talk about our sexual history like most couples do and I admitted that I'd had sex with quite a few more people than he had (his number was only five, mine was 33 including him). At the time he just laughed about it and said it was no big deal. After all almost every relationship he'd ever been in had been long ones while I sort of just dated guys randomly when I was younger. So no big deal, right?

Flash forward to earlier this month. We were visiting his parents to give them the news in person that I was finally pregnant (we had been trying for months). During dinner a woman I had never met came up to our table and started talking to Dave like she was an old friend of his. At the time all he said by way of explanation was that they had gone to high school together.

Last week I noticed the same woman making a comment on his Facebook wall. I didn't even know they were facebook friends so I asked him about it. He said that she had added him as a facebook friend after running into us at that restaurant. I wasn't jealous or anything but I was just curious so I asked him if they'd ever had any kind of romantic relationship back in highschool. He was understandably uncomfortable by the question but I swore to him that I didn't care. Finally he said that yeah, she was one of his five.

I did not care. I'm facebook friends with some of my former partners too. But one thing didn't make sense: he had told me that he lost his virginity when he was 20. How could she be one of his five since he moved away from home after highschool and obviously she hadn't?

Oh, he told me, they'd never had actual sex. Just oral sex.

I admit I laughed at that. I said, ""Wait, how many of your 'five' did you have actual sex with?""

He just looked at me blankly and said, Well, just you and _______ (the woman he'd been living with just before he and I got together).

I was stunned. I just said, ""Oh, okay. That's fine."" I'd had no idea that I was only the second woman he ever had sex with.

A few minutes later he said, Wait, do you mean you had actual intercourse with all 33 of your 33?""

When I admitted I had he seemed shocked. He said, ""So you weren't counting oral sex? How long would the list be if you counted oral?""

I'll admit, the temptation to lie was strong. But I resisted. I just spoke the truth. ""At least a hundred, I'm not sure.""

That's when he got mad. He stood up, called me a ""stupid slut"" and then stormed out of the house.

When he returned later I was still in tears but he had calmed down. He apologized for calling me a slut. But ever since then I see no love in his eyes when he looks at me. I walk around all day worrying about this. We made love for the first time since that fight two nights ago and he was a lot rougher than normal. I felt no love at all.

And this is the father of my first born child, due in July. The whole dynamic of our marriage seems to have changed and I feel like he hates me or think less of me just because I was promiscuous when I was younger. I've always been faithful to him and isn't that what should matter most?

Earlier today my mom was talking to me about my plans for the nursery and I just couldn't endure the conversation. I made an excuse and hung up on her. The truth is I'm not sure I want this baby anymore or at least I'm not sure I want this husband anymore.

Only my best friend knows about this, because he was there when the event happened. I'll start with a little background information:

I was extremely athletic in high school. I played football (I was actually a D-1 prospect), threw the discus and shotput, and ran cross country and marathons. I never really had problems with my weight, as I exercised enough that it really didn't matter how much I ate. I would estimate that I probably took in anywhere from 5,000-8,000 calories in any given day, and I stayed between 10% and 11.5% body fat pretty much at all times.

When I was 17, however, I tore my shoulder up in football practice, and re-tore it wakeboarding, and had to basically quit all of my sports. I was given the option to have surgery, which would have allowed me to possibly play the last game of the season in football, but never be able to throw again, or not have surgery and just do physical therapy and sit out football/track anyway and deal with a longer recovery. I picked option #2, since it seemed like I wasn't going to play football/track any more anyway, so I didn't really want to go under the knife.

Long story short, I was on pain meds for the better part of a year, and got really fat. My entire lifestyle changed, but my eating habits never did. I gained a lot of weight. 

Anyway, I got really into computer games at this time. I played WoW a lot. During my freshman year of college, something fucking ridiculous happened. I lived with two guys, lets call them Lester and Jim. L&amp;J were pretty much my best friends since forever. We really liked living together.

Lester, however, had this cunt of a girlfriend. We'll call her cunt. She fucking sucked (not in the sexy way). Anyways, Jim played WoW with me. We had good times. We were all over at Cunt's house one night. Me and Jim were playing some WoW at the kitchen table and Lester and Cunt decided to go get some ice cream. Being the fatasses that we were, we just gave them money and had them bring ours back. 

Anyways, while we were sitting there, I told Jim: ""Dude, I've gotta shit man. It's fucking bad. I've never felt like this before"". Jim said something back along the lines of ""Quit being a pussy, you can go shit in like 15 minutes after we kill all of this trash, etc."" (for anyone who knows WoW, I know what you're thinking - trash would be the perfect time to go take a poo. You got kicked from the guild we were in for afk'ing trash.).

Anyways, I sit there for another 5 minutes in misery. I'm fucking sweating bullets. Even though the AC is on like 68, I'm hot as shit. I can't sit still. I'm swaying back and forth in my chair. My stomach is audibly groaning. I decide at this time that a healthy compromise to my situation is to let out a relief fart. Who hasn't done that in such a situation? Bad fucking idea.

I let this little relief fart slip, and I immediately regret it. I tell Jim: ""Dude, that was a greasy ass fart. I can still feel it."" We go about our nerdyness for another 5 minutes or so, and we can both still smell this thing. Jim is like, ""Dude, that is the worst thing I've ever smelled."" I still feel greasy at this point, but I have no idea what I've done, still.

I get up in another 5 minutes, and what I see literally changed my life. I shit. I didn't just shit, though. I shit everywhere. It was all over the back of my shorts, there was a huge puddle of it in the chair. It wasn't just shit, either. It was this orange puddle of what looked like a mix of the grease that comes off of baby back ribs and movie theatre popcorn butter. It's running down my leg. It's stained the fuck out of this white cloth chair that I'm sitting in. This was the most scared that I've ever been in my life.

**Side note/explanation:**

(I had been on the weight loss drug Alli for about a day, and had no idea what it did or how it worked. I just knew that you took it and your food didn't make you fat any more. We ate Chinese buffet for lunch that day, so I figured I'd just take a little extra to offset the immense amount of fat that was inevitably going to be in my meal. I didn't know that it was going to make me spew filthy ass butter from my lower orifice uncontrollably. We later named this shit the ""butter piss pills"".)

**Anyway...**

All sorts of things start running through my head. ""What is Lester going to do? There's no way he'll still be friends with me after I shit on his girlfriend's chair! He'll want me to move out!"" etc. Cunt happened to be in a sorority, and I was pledging a fraternity, so I was sure she was going to inform all of my pledge class and my upperclassmen fraternity members, not to mention the other members of her sorority. I was humiliated.

I frantically got up, cleaned myself off, and tried to clean her chair. Jim is rolling on the floor laughing. We ended up just moving her chair over into the corner of the table that people sat at less often. Lester and cunt pull up to the house. My heart sinks in my chest. I'm about to have to deal with the reprocussions of my actions. I'm going to have to transfer schools.

They came in, and the first thing out of Lester's mouth is: ""who shit themselves?"". Somehow, Jim stayed quiet, and I managed to hold back my tears of fear. I told Jim to get me the fuck out of there. We left, bought a chair identical to the one that I shit on, and replaced it while Cunt wasn't looking. She or Lester never found out. Nobody except for me and Jim knows this, and I've blackmailed Jim to an oath of secrecy. I just had to get this out.

**Update**

Thank you all for the support in your kind comments. I'll fill you in on my life since this event, and how I've picked up the pieces. 

I quit taking Alli after this incident. This happened in early 2009. I took the stuff because I thought it would be an easy way to lose some weight, but I didn't really care enough to actually change my lifestyle, so I just stayed fat for a while. In 2011, I lost about 100 lbs eating healthy and exercising. I'm not back to my peak condition, but I feel good about myself and my lifestyle now, so I'm good with it. 

I graduated college in 2012, I have a great career, a wonderful girlfriend, and I'm having a kid in July. All in all, I feel like I picked up the pieces and carried on pretty well. 

Lester and Cunt broke up in late 2010, and Jim is now engaged. We're all still really good friends, but we live in 3 separate towns. We try to hang out as much as we can.

Me and Jim both quit playing WoW in 2010, but we both came back to play casually in the new expansion that just came out. We're actually doing really well with the whole ""casual"" thing (that rarely works for most people with this game). We typically only play on early Saturday mornings or while his fiance and my girlfriend are both at work.

The grad student I work for is great, but all of us assistants help any grad who needs it. The assistants basically run the lab, and we do anything from running experiments to data collection and entry.   

A grad, Carol, is a bitch. She treats us assistants like trash, blames everything that goes wrong on us, and leaves her messes and expects us to clean it up (that's not our job). If anything is out of place, she will do things like call us all over to her work area, and ask ""do you see what's wrong here?"" and expect us to figure it out and fix it for her. 

This has been going on for over a year, and after a few months of it, I couldn't take it any longer. I've talked to other grads and the PI, but there is essentially nothing that can be done, though they concede that Carol has a rude attitude. 

What I've been doing is carefully manipulating Carol's data. I sometimes switch the data for control and experimental groups, and sometimes I fudge the numbers altogether. I have switched her control and experimental reagents so that she will never have a significant result. There is little chance I could get caught, but even if I did, I can find another lab. I secretly hoped her experiment is delayed and inevitably indefensible. It would all be because of me, as payback for having to endure her attitude every day all day.

But today, I wish I could take it back. She's been talked to by her advisor, and treats us mildly better now. She is learning and getting better at handling conflict, even though she still is coarse and rude. I regret screwing up her data, and I've stopped. I wish I could take it all back because my revenge was not fair and equal, and will never teach her to be better.

I'm trying to break free from it. I felt like maybe I had gotten more mature since then.

My best friend and his girlfriend were in the truck and I was in the trailer with my 2 gay friends.

One of the guys went to use the bathroom and the other went to get something from the cooler. I took this opportunity to take my shorts and underwear off. I don't know why I did it... but they couldnt see me behind the table and I had a blanket covering the top.

We just filled up gas so I knew that I had at least 4-5 hours before the next stop... privacy with these 2 dudes. I wanted my dick sucked bad and had a raging hardon. I slowly moved the blanket down to were my dick was exposed over the top.. Then one of the guys notices and yanks the blanket down and said ""dude, what are you doing?""

I was lost for words. In my mind I'm all ""ok, these guys are gonna just go apeshit crazy and start sucking my dick""... but they just kinda ignored it and I felt really REALLY embarassed. Lost my boner and just sat there playing cards like and idiot. 

like 10 minutes later (felt like hours later) the other guy said ""you should really put your pants on""... when I got up to put my shorts on, I noticed I precummed all over my leg and my dick sucked itself into its body cavity... looked like a little halloween candy corn. 0_o

1368726692.0,254,self.confession,1egou1,"I grew up in a sexually abusive religious cult, freed when I was 14. AMA",300,46,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1egou1/i_grew_up_in_a_sexually_abusive_religious_cult/,"I grew up outside of a small town in rural US. When I was very little my parents were kicked out of our local evangelical church and were eventually recruited to join a ""true church"". For the next 12 years I raised with that cult/church's teachings. 

The church/cult had three tenants the apostle (leader of the cult) was most obsessed with. 1. Women are to be subservient to men in all ways. 2. The government is out to get us. 3. Only the apostle can tell outsiders of our church's existence. 

The cult was very secretive. I was taught at the age of five or six how to keep my eye out for possible government watchers, evil men who were trying to track down our church and its members so that they could be rounded up and executed. The apostle spoke often about discovering listening devices at his work, in his house, and urged us all to constantly search for such devices ourselves. Even at school I was supposed to keep an eye out for spies and government infiltrators. When a teacher once told the class that the earth revolved around the sun I reported this to my parents and they promptly had me transferred to another school. My first small act of rebellion may have been when the new school taught the same ungodly principles and I did not tell my parents. I'd lost my friends once and didn't want to go through that again.

Our church meetings were just as secretive. Never held in the same house twice in a row. We would get in the car when we weren't hosting, drive around for half an hour while my dad constantly asked my brother and I if we noticed any of the same cars twice. If we did, sometimes he'd stop for gas or something and have my brother and I keep watch before we moved on. Once we arrived at the house my mom always had a pot or casserole dish or something with her, sometimes my dad had empty boxes wrapped in wrapping paper, my bother and I would carry balloons. These were the lessons the apostle gave about how to avoid suspicion. If it looked like we were going to a party or some other social gathering our church's discovery would be far less likely.

The actual meetings were usually held in basements because the danger of being around upstairs windows was too great, even with curtains drawn. We didn't have a basement ourselves so my dad actually painted the windows of one of the upstairs bedrooms black. That was my bedroom by the way. 

We met twice a week after dinner and usually got home at 10. But each time either my dad or mother, and later my brother, would stay behind. Another member would drop them off by midnight, sometimes later. These were the advanced meetings. I was too young to go to them. Until I turned fourteen.

My mother told me that on my fourteenth birthday I would be baptized again by the apostle, this time with fire referring to John the Baptist's prophecy that Jesus would baptize with fire. Now I was the age the Virgin Mary had been when the holy spirit impregnated her. This excited me because the church and its teachings were everything to me but I had so many questions. I had always been told that all would be revealed once I was baptized with fire.

That night she and my dad dropped me off at the apostle's house. I was wearing the nicest dress I owned, and my mom had told me to remember everything I had been taught. That night after a long lecture from the apostle he told me to undress and prepare for my baptism. What followed is sort of foggy in my head and I'm not sure how much of it really happened and how much are just from nightmares and years of using my imagination to fill in gaps of my memories. What I know for a fact is that he took my virginity that night and declared me baptized.

Our church was very small. 30-35 members including all the children. Of those there were now 18 full members who had been baptized by fire. Over the next three months I had sex with every one of them and in every way you can imagine during our advanced lessons. At home I was also subservient to my father and brother.

Things were very chaotic for me at this time. I was in constant pain and didn't understand why the holy spirit wasn't filling me with joy the way the apostle kept promising it would. I lied and said I did and I continued to be a devoted member. Until one day at school the pain (severe cramping, bleeding, bruising, burning) became so much that I tried to get up from my desk in class to go use the bathroom. I felt dizzy and lightheaded. The next thing I remember is being in a hospital bed.

I was told later that I nearly bled out. My mom had thought I was just having a very heavy flow so she had stocked me up with pads and I'd been going through one an hour. But it turns out that some internal tearing combined with a miscarriage had led me to nearly die. 

It took over two weeks before the police got involved because they had no evidence of any crime. My parents had feigned ignorance about me being sexually active and the cops had gone off on a wild goose chase for a possible rapist in town, focusing on one innocent man in particular most of that time. When I was to be discharged from the hospital finally the cops chose at the last minute to seek possible family abuse as the cause of my injuries and I was sent to a foster home. Eventually I broke one of our big rules and told revealed the existence of the church: I kept crying one day and telling my social worker I had to see the apostle, I had to get back to church.

Everything unraveled then. My brother (who my father would later scream ""JUDAS! JUDAS! to during a court hearing) spilled most of the details first. The apostle was found and arrested, most of the members of the church were also arrested though only a few were charged.

It took a very long time before I was de-programmed all the way. I believed so much now that everything the apostle had said was coming true, the evil government was breaking up our church, throwing its members in dark cells. The devil was winning, defeating us, and it was all my fault for being weak.

The state needed me as a witness so the trial against my dad and the apostle, the two strongest cases they had, were delayed for months. Eventually I came to realize that everything I had been taught were lies. I agreed to testify finally but only had to do so once: against the apostle and that first night with him. 

After he was convicted my dad plead guilty to avoid the maximum penalties. My mom's lawyer got her institutionalized in a mental hospital as part of a plea agreement that she would cooberate some of me and my brother's testimony. A few other members of the church also got plea deals. I don't know what happened to the rest but I know at least a few members got off scot free.

After nearly a year of being in the care of the state I was finally allowed to move to my grandparent's house in another state. They have been good parents to me. I have not seen my dad since his sentencing hearing. I have not seen my mom since the day I was supposed to be discharged from the hospital, just before the state swooped in and said not-so-fast.

AMA?,357,102,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1bweby/ive_been_pretending_to_be_someone_im_not_on/,"There *is* some backstory to this, I didn't just decide to do it on a whim. About a year and a half ago, my friend got really suspicious of her boyfriend. She found pictures on his phone of other girls, that he claimed he'd just downloaded off the internet for fap material. 

They'd been together for 4 years at that point, and she didn't want to walk out on a gut feeling. So she created a fake Facebook, of this really hot girl. She got the pictures from a friend of her sisters (her sister lived out of the state, for college.) The friend actually agreed to let her use the pictures and thought it was funny =/ Added a bunch of ""filler"" friends, and within a few days, the profile really looked legit. 

She added her boyfriend on FB using the account, he accepts, and in a few days, they're swapping nudes. Guy starts talking about how he's going to leave his girlfriend for that girls ""sweet pussy"" and just a lot of shit... friend dumps the guy. At this point, I took over the profile. I didn't have any reason to, and didn't have a boyfriend at the time.. but I started hitting up guys on there, flirting with them, sending nudes, etc. Since then, I've collected about 300 pictures of naked guys (and some girls...) 

I wasn't using it (at first) to get anybody in trouble. I would hit up guys I didn't really want to talk to on my own, flirt with them, get dick pictures, etc. It was like this dirty little secret. These guys that I was in class with, I knew how big their dicks were, I knew their weird little fantasies, stupid shit like that.

After about 8 months of this crap, I realized a lot of these guys were getting into relationships... but they were still talking to ""me"" and trying to get nudes and shit. I started screenshotting our conversations and sending them to the guys girlfriends. Few days later, no longer in a relationship. 

At first it felt like some kind of sick vigilante justice, like they had it coming to them, how dare they cheat on their girlfriends with some girl that they'll never meet. Then it just turned into some kind of a game for me. I'd add guys that I KNEW were in relationships, and bait them. Probably about 80% of them went for it. The rest immediately deleted and blocked me. 

I have no idea how many people I've caused to break up over this, and I'm not really even that girl. It pissed me off to see how easily guys would attempt to cheat on their girlfriends, sometimes even fiances and wives.. 

A few weeks ago, a girl sent me a message telling me she wished I had never messaged her the screenshots. That it killed her to see her boyfriend sending pictures of his dick, pictures of him totally naked, to me. She told me how happy she was, and that she'd rather of not known and how much it had ruined her life. They'd been together for 7 years, and were going to get married this summer. After I messaged her, she raided his FB and found out that he'd been messaging like 20 girls, doing the same shit he did with me. It amazed me that she didn't want to know that kind of thing... ignorance is bliss, I guess? 

I closed the account after that. Told the friend I didn't need any new pictures, that I was done and so was my friend. I feel horrible about ruining so many relationships, but if I had of been those girls, I would have wanted to know =/

**EDIT: There was a comment that I can't find anymore, asking about my relationship status during all of this.** I was not in a relationship when it started, and hadn't really been in a relationship during that time. I have been dating a guy for a few months now, and he knows about the fake profile and me sending the nudes. He's also okay with me posting on /r/gonewild so it wasn't that big of a deal to him.

My niece is 10 and was at a luncheon my dad threw for me for graduating college. During lunch, she sat at a table with my family, and I sat at a table with all my friends. At some point she got in trouble with her mom (my sister-in-law) and was taken into the bathroom. When they came back to their table, my niece's eyes were red. I still don't know why she got in trouble.

During dessert, my niece got out of her chair to come over to talk to me and my friends. The restaurant tables had paper on top so you could draw on them. My friends and I were enjoying our coffee pies and drawing on the table when she came over. She just started being really rude. She was criticizing people's drawings and calling everyone weird. My friends were tolerating her really well, but I was really embarrassed. I sent her back to her table.

Instead of telling her parents like I should have, I held my tongue. I didn't want to get her in more trouble. I just didn't want a scene. Instead, I took matters into my own hands.

While everyone was leaving, my niece was sitting by herself at the table. Coffee really messes up my tummy, and I was already farting. As I walked past my niece, I crop dusted her. The fart was really hot so I know it must have smelled. I didn't stick around to see how she reacted.

I feel bad because what I did was immature. If she's acting that way, she needs to be corrected by her parents and not farted on. Thanks for listening; I needed this.

This is one of those days.,326,73,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/19cggw/mom_confession_some_days_i_wish_my_son_had_never/,"I posted on adviceanimals with a confession bear meme, but someone suggested I come here instead...that maybe some other parents here would ""get it"".

My son has very serious impulse control issues. Medication (ritalin for ADD) has helped, when he's on it. But it wears off around 8pm every night. He's in pretty intensive therapy, but progress is very, very slow with lots of backsliding.

He steals from us. And lies about it. Repeat, repeat , repeat. He couldn't care less about consequences, because they don't enter into his mind when he's committing the act. (This is my pre-emptive argument against those who are going to say to spank/beat/deprive/starve him.)

This weekend he stole money from my purse so that he could buy a book at the book fair at school... just two days after he took my Kindle and denied, denied, denied, until we caught him with it in the middle of the night.

I really don't want to have to keep all of my possessions under lock and key. He's only 11....

His 9-year-old sister suffers, too, and she's a great kid. The entire family is suffering.

I love him. It's just an ""end of my rope"" day.

**Quick edit about reading** 
Lots of folks have picked up on the fact that he took my Kindle and stole money to get a book. He took the Kindle to play the games and watch Minecraft videos on YouTube. The book he bought at the book fair was a Lego Ninjago book that came with a free action figure he wanted. That being said, we are a reading family and he has many books and at least twice-monthly trips to the library. The stealing is not about getting access to reading. Oh, how I wish!

**Second edit**
It's been nice to read all your comments. Here at work I can definitely get a ""break"" from him and get some perspective. Heading home and trying not to have expectations one way or the other about what I'll find when I get there!

**Final Edit**
I wrote this out as a comment reply, but it seems like a good summation as well.

As they say, today is a new day. He was a dear last night. We had a nice dinner, he tried to show me how to play Heroscape and was patient with my Mom fail on that. We watched a Pokemon show (ugh) and snuggled in his bed.

We've all probably felt things about people we love that would devastate them if they knew it. I make sure to tell my son that I love him and always will, even when I am angry and frustrated, and even when I am disappointed. 

And yes... there are days when I fantasize about what my life would be like with myself, my husband and our completely average daughter. Or even just my husband and me! 

But then there are those days... when my son kicks my ass on a ski slope and laughs and laughs; when he is loving and gentle with his dog; when he's the one who rushes to help a lady who dropped something in a store (true story). 

I can't imagine truly giving up on him. I won't.

One night I spent the night at his place and he got up early to go to class so I slept in a little. I woke up and started to think about the relationship and how I hadn't been a great girlfriend. I was thinking while I was looking around the room and my eyes kept going to the bookshelf. I saw an interesting looking book and grabbed it off the shelf and when I put it back I noticed a little book with no title on the cover so I opened it. As soon as I saw his handwriting I knew what I was doing was wrong but I didn't stop myself. 
He wrote that he had slept with someone not too long after we had started spending a lot of time together and he wondered if he would ever tell me. 
He also wrote that his friend told him I had control issues and was dangerous and he agreed. (Obviously that was true because I was reading his journal x_x).
He said he felt trapped by me, didn't understand what was happening between us, and his handwriting became so angry and messy that I almost couldn't read it. 
I was pretty beat up over it and obviously couldn't tell him.

I had had an attraction to this friend for years, and a situation arose where I realized there was a really simple place where I could hide my phone and just switch on the video recorder so I could secretly see what her body looked like. The process worked well, and I got a video of what I was looking for. I uploaded it to my computer and looked at it frequently for a little while for masturbation material. Eventually, after holding onto it for about two weeks, I had to delete it because I couldn't live with myself for doing that. Every time I went to my computer to watch it while masturbating, I felt like dying. It was a double edged sword, being aroused by something and hating myself for being aroused by it at the same time. I have betrayed my friend, and betrayed myself. I felt slightly better after deciding to delete it, but I still remember the video sometimes when I'm masturbating. And the guilt will never leave me. I want to tell her, but I can never confess this to her because she would never want to be friends again, and I wouldn't blame her. And she is one of the only close friends I've got. I just can't believe I could betray the trust of someone I care about so deeply.

His neighbor is a lovely woman, but she lives on her own with her kid. Her kid is bright and funny, but he is bullied at school, not liked, has no dad and is generally drifting through life. We were chatting, and all he wants is a father figure. That's all he wants. She was giving him beers. He's fucking 12. Jesus. He was talking to me. He wants me to come over and teach him languages and science (which I know, and he heard me speaking to my friends about). 

There's not much to confess here. I've met so many kids like him, and for the first time I'm in the situation to help. I want to help him. His mum is fantastic apart from the fact she's a bit warped. Fuck. I'm so upset. I've been drinking now because I cant think about it. I just left, I couldnt cope. I had to say goodbye. I didn't do shit at my mates house because I didn't want to expose the kid to booze and drugs, but nobody else gave a shit. Fuck. I just want to help, and I'm going to.

Nothing to really confess. I just want to splurge this off my chest.

God. I'm so sorry kid. I wish I could do more. Fuck.

**EDIT:** Me here, again. I've sobered up this morning and put things into a better perspective. First things first: Yes, I know the above message is fucked up, badly written and in the wrong subreddit. Sorry about that. I didn't want to come across as defending or deriding the mother in this situation, but I was upset and a bit drunk, so that went out the window. The situation is as described above, but there are a few missing details. 

Secondly: I'm going to try and do that right thing and mentor this kid as suggested. Maybe play some sport with him or teach him some basic stuff. I'm not going to be a lecturer or a teacher, but try to be his friend. This kid doesn't have a lot, and even his mum was getting upset saying that she couldn't do anything. She was the one who asked me last night if would come over and mentor him a bit (no, she wasn't drunk).

Finally: For those of you who are saying 1) I might appear to be a peadophile or 2) I should phone CPS, firstly, she asked me to come over to help the kid, I've met her a couple of times before, so this isn't weird or anything. I'm not going to take the kid in my van or anything, so don't worry about that. With regards to CPS, I'm not going to do that. Their household isn't too fucked up, and it would only make it worse if I tore it apart like that. If it gets too heavy I might reconsider, but for now, this is a bullied, worried, lost kid who just needs a friend or a father figure or something. So no CPS.

I've seen SO many places on street view - my favorite time-killer ever. I feel like crying when I do it but I do it anyway. I realize this is nowhere as messed up as the other posts here. whatever.

**Edit**

Looking at all these beautiful replies I wish I'd posted this from my main account. A lot of questions are about why I cannot travel and why I feel bad about street view.

I cannot travel because I have a startup tied to my location and I cannot leave it at all for a few years - it's in early stages. I think I feel bad about what I do on street view because nearly all my facebook-friends have travelled A LOT. They constantly post awesome pictures from all over the world and although I pretend what I do is way more important and will give me the freedom to travel in maybe 5-6 years, I'm horribly jealous of all of them and I pretend on google street view that I'm doing what they are already doing for real.

I absolutely agree it's wonderfully great technology though - what if I were disabled or homeless next to a starbucks with an iphone that someone threw my way because they wanted a newer version? It's revolutionary stuff.

**Edit 2**

Also, I did think only I was doing it and everyone else was busy living. I'm glad so many of you do it. :D If it helps, here are a few more ways of pseudo-travelling -

* read yelp and foursquare reviews of local businesses

* at [matrix.itasoftware.com](http://matrix.itasoftware.com), you can specify ""include all airports within 500 miles of this airport"" and ""give best quote in a 30 day window""

* shortlist airbnb places in that location based on price, nearness to interesting venues and reviews

* visit that place's subreddit

* if possible try to learn their local language. For example, open up /r/croatia and the [translated version](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=reddit.com%2Fr%2Fcroatia) in 2 adjacent google chrome tabs and switch between them and try to match the words.

I looked at the casuals ads on Craigslist. Found a man who was willing to pay any price. I said 200 he said 150. So we settled on 170. I went to his house and we had sex. my boyfriend encouraged it. I don't blame him. These are tough times. Sometimes you gotta kick your feelings to the side and do what is the quickest and easiest thing to do. We had a bag of spinach and a carrot in the fridge. Our power has been out for days, and we cant afford new candles Because we burnt out the ones we had. It's pitch black at home.   




I'm at my mums right now to use the Internet. I feel so alone.
All I want right now is to cuddle my boyfriend and to kiss his chest and play with his fingers :(.... All I want is us holding each other knowing we can get through this. Times are hard right now. For everyone. 




This won't be the last time I do it. I have another 'client' lined up for tomorrow night. 




If this is what I have to do to put food in our fridge and make my boyfriend comfortable, then I'll do it a thousand times. 




When I submit this, I'm going to kick those feelings over again and put them away. In a tiny chest in a dolls house in the back of my heart. It'll have a little rusted key an ill swallow it up and no one will get it. 




If my future kids ever ask me what's the worst thing I've ever done, I'll say shoplifting. 




Don't lecture me please. I don't care if it was wrong. I needed to feed my family. I needed to get money to pay for candles so we can see. I need a new dress that isn't stained or ripped! 




Everyone thinks its easy to get jobs. It isn't. Someone like me, a high school drop out with no qualifications, never gets jobs. If this is what I was meant to do then this is what I'm going to do

While your mum lays in bed unable to move more than a meter out the door. You would want to help your family.  



I'm not saying I'm perfect. I'm saying I did what was right for ME.

They lived in a small apartment across the street from me.  Apparently there was some never-ending drama with Dean's father and Paula was very protective of him, border-lining on insane.  From what I gathered the father had threatened to kill the both of them if he ever found them, so they lived in constant fear.  Blinds drawn, doors triple locked, he was never allowed outside.  It was a sad and strange situation.  Because he wasn't allowed outside I spent a lot of time playing with him at his house.  He had a lot of sweet toys, nintendo, trading cards, games.  I would often sleep over and we would play together for hours.

Paula was probably in her late 30's at the time.  She was blonde, very skinny and very attractive. On quite a few occasions she would do things to seemingly tease me with her body and then gauge my reaction.  Once she was showing me how she liked to work out...I remember the only thing she had on was a long sleeping t-shirt and a pair of panties.  She was lifting these dumbbells up and down and spreading her legs apart while she did it so I could see her crotch.  She knew that I could see and she was smiling at me.  Things like this happened several times and I admit that I would even get a boner which I had to try and hide.

One day I came over to play with Dean and she asked who it was without opening the door.  She seemed really scared that someone was knocking by the tone of her voice. She said through the door that he was at his grandmas house and that I should go.  I turned and started going down the stairs when she suddenly opened the door and poked her head out.  She told me that he would be home in a few minutes and that if I wanted to wait for him inside then I could.

I went in and she was just home from work, wearing a blouse, a very short skirt, white pantyhose and high heels.  I remember that outfit to this day because it's burned into my mind.  I sat on the couch and she sat next to me.  She started asking me questions about how Dean was behaving at school and other things about her son.  The whole time she was crossing and uncrossing her legs and dangling one of her shoes off.

She kicked the heels off and told me that her feet were hurting from working all day and asked if I would mind giving her a foot massage.  I felt a little weird about it but I said ok.  She laid down on the couch and put her feet on my lap with her legs spread slightly apart and I rubbed her feet for her.  She said her calves hurt and asked me to rub her legs too so I did.  

At that point she took one of my hands and moved it up to her crotch and asked me if I would rub that too.  I was really uncomfortable but I just did it anyway.  I don't want to get into too much detail here because it's pretty perverse but she ended up making me give her oral sex.  When I was done she gave me oral sex too, and then laid me down on the floor and climbed on top of me and had sex with me.  She made me call her mommy the whole time.

I lost touch with Dean over the years and never told a soul about this, but as I grew older I stared to get the suspicion that she had done things like this with her son too.  Just the way he acted and she acted I could tell that they had a different kind of relationship and that something was definitely 'off' with him.

Not too long ago I tried to find Him/her online but besides an obituary mentioning her there was nothing else, no facebook pages, white pages listings or anything.

I really don't know what kind of answers/ advice I'm looking for here.  It's just something I've had inside me way too long that needed to come out. 

edit: spelling

Edit 2: when I mentioned the obituary it was for a member of her family, not her. She was just listed as one of the next of kin so I'm assuming she is still alive.

She had a problem with meth and cocaine in her younger years, but kicked the habit a couple years before I was born. I don't know what caused her to start using again, and I don't know how she could have taken the chance if she ever had my well-being in mind, but she started it up and it held onto her. Hard. Before, she was funny and loving and sweet. Always got me to and from school, worked her hardest every day, kept the house clean, made sure I had food in my belly and that I went to bed every night. It completely changed. She stole from friends and family (including MY friends), lied, screamed and threw things, bring strange men home and all of these things I never thought she would ever do. Because of her, I was left with no friends and a filthy home to fend for myself in. I hated her so very much, and yet, I loved her. I just hated the way she changed. 

I was 14 when the state took me and put me into a foster home, and then my aunt's home. I do not know my biological father, and for a time, none of my relatives would take me for fear of retaliation from her. She was quite violent. It was awhile after I moved into my aunt's house that my mom was allowed to come see me, and I thought she was starting to do better. I could forgive her for the things she had done to me, and I began to warm up to her. Our relationship started to turn around until she came to her sister's home, quite obviously high. My aunt tried to shield me from her as she tried to come through the front door, but the look in her eyes was all too familiar. 

That trust was broken again and I was extremely angry. The months of reconnecting had all been ruined, and in a moment of anger, I came up to the door planning on just screaming at her. My whole body was in knots, and I couldn't scream. I could only look at her in the eye and let the tears come down silently and tell her to kill herself. I don't fucking love you, and you should just kill yourself. It's not worth your time to try anymore. Just die already. She turned around and hung herself in her room a few miles away on September 3, 2006. Almost exactly six years ago. 

I'm sorry, Reddit. You're my dumping ground. I'm away from home in college, alone in my apartment and none of my roommates have any idea of what I've done or why I've been a bit mopey these last couple of days.

1337709465.0,242,self.confession,tzkl9,I had an 18 month long love affair with my niece,294,52,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/tzkl9/i_had_an_18_month_long_love_affair_with_my_niece/,"My niece is only a year younger than me. I was born when my sister was in her early 20s and she had her first child “Melinda” when I was only about a year old. Until I was about ten my sister lived with me, our parents, and one of our other siblings. Then she moved away for a few years before returning to the area but living on her own as a single mother.

Melinda went to the same highschool as me. Whenever she saw me in the halls she used to say “Hey, Uncle Tim!” and laugh. We found the whole thing pretty hilarious even though our friends and fellow students stopped thinking the joke was funny early on. I used to have friends tell me that I should totally “tap my niece”. I would respond by saying, “How do you know I haven't already?” but they knew I was joking. Melinda was cool, and pretty hot, and we got along really well. But she was technically my niece. Her mom shared the same parents as I did you know?

We stayed in touch through college but only barely. I would hear things about her through my mom or sister and occasionally she would give me a call (usually regarding family related matters) or I'd send her an e-mail but we pretty much became extended family for a while. Then one day she called to tell me she was thinking of moving to the Big City where I now lived. We were both in our mid 20s by now. She asked if she could come for a visit so she could see what the city was like. I had recently kicked out my roommate so I had a spare room (first time living 100% alone! Fuck yeah) so I told her sure, come and visit for as long as you want. What are uncles for?

It had been about a year since I'd last seen her and I have to tell you when I met her at the airport I felt something that made me feel embarrassed. I was really attracted to her. I had always acknowledged she was good looking but I had never had any sexual desire for her. Now? Its hard to explain but just the way she carried herself and her hair and everything else, something I can't put my finger on, really turned me on. But, she was my niece. It's not like anything was going to happen, nor should it.

Until it did. Her third night there we were getting drunk at my apartment when I realized she was flirting with me. She was talking about the disaster that had been her last relationship and how she woke up one morning realizing she had to get away and her first thought was trying to make it in the Big City like her favorite Uncle had. She joked and teased, laughed at my jokes, kept finding excuses to touch me (you know, like: “Oh, you've got an eyelash on your cheek, here let me get it”) and kept asking me questions about my own romantic adventures. I was sober enough to know what she was doing but drunk enough not to care. So when that moment came, that awkward moment where you're looking into her eyes and you can just sense she wants you to do it, I did. I kissed her.

The next morning over breakfast she insisted we talk about what we had done even though I would have rather just pretend nothing had happened. Finally I said the big “I” word: incest. She told me she was on birth control so she wasn't about to get pregnant so I didn't have to worry. And why, she asked, should societal norms dictate our lives? Clearly there was chemistry between us, she argued, and she also admitted to having had feelings for me since highschool. She was tired of ending up with jerks and losers and I was neither. It wasn't fair that I had to be off limits just because technically she was my niece.

Little Tim did the thinking for me. It wanted to agree with everything she said. Eventually I was even adding my own rationalizations, like pointing out that we'd always gotten along and shared so many of the same interests. Who was to say she wasn't my soulmate? Just because my big sister was her mom I wasn't allowed to be with her? Bullshit!

This post has gone on long enough so I'll just sum the rest up. Melinda ended up living with me for the next eighteen months as my girlfriend. Eventually I met a woman who didn't have the handicap of being my sister's daughter and I fell in love with her. I told Melinda we had to break up and even told her why. She was upset at first but a couple days later she said that it would had to have happened eventually anyway. Our unique relationship was way too complicated. She asked if she could continue staying with me, but living in the spare bedroom, until she found a place for herself. I said sure. About a month later she had found a flat she could afford and moved into it.

That's my confession. Nobody in our family knows about it, nor do any of my friends except one. He figured it out because of fucking Facebook. That's why I deleted my Facebook profile and also why I'm glad he was willing to ask the awkward question, “Uh, isn't that Melinda in that photo with your sister? With the comment 'me with my big girl on her Xth birthday?”. Otherwise I'm sure more people would have put two and two together.

Oh and how do I feel about everything that happened? Gross sometimes, nostalgic other times. It's weird seeing her now especially at family events. Those are the worst. Also I think her fiance is a fucking tool. Is that the opinion of a jealous ex-lover or a protective uncle? I don't know.

Every time I've been to a wedding or at an Indian party, I fake being mellow because I don't like people knowing my true beliefs on my heritage.

I hate being an Indian American. I love my parents and a lot of what they've done for me, but I hate the fact that I never got to observe real love in action. My mom and dad exist like business partners. They get along okay, usually ""tolerate"" each other. They've never been affectionate in front of me, ever.

Since a young age, I was warped by the belief that American romance was beneath me - that it was stupid and whimsical and Indians were superior somehow. As a result, I didn't date anyone high school and early college, until I started to take a good look at the world around me and realized how empty Indian people's lives really are. Now I feel like a total fool. I'd wash my skin white if I could. I'd go back in time and learn how relationships work so I'm not a total manchild at the age of 21 (which I currently am) and so I can actually start building my own love life. But as it stands now, I have no experience in anything and am weighed down by this stupid Indianness. My parents are already hinting that it'd break their hearts if I don't marry a nice Indian women; they're pretty liberal so I don't think I'll be forced into anything, but I don't want to cause them grief either.

I don't like people assuming that I have to be a doctor or lawyer or engineer, and **especially** the focus on money. I do want to be a doctor, but it's because I love the idea of that career, not because I want to make money. Maybe Doctors without Borders once I get my degree, something to help those who need it most. My parents think it's a stupid and idealistic plan, so does my entire extended family. They ridicule me and say I should be content to settle down as a rich surgeon with a nice house in California and not be so ""young and naive"". This is pervasive in Indian culture.

I was dating my dad's business partner's son, because it seemed like the right thing to do, even though he treated me terribly.

I was petty and mean and judgmental. I wasn't a good person. I'm not proud of who I was back then.

Then I was raped.

I couldn't handle being on campus anymore... so I took a semester off of school and moved back to my hometown, just as the first SlutWalk was starting up. I got involved in that. I got angry. I started figuring out feminism. I marched in SlutWalk and met some incredible women who changed my life. 

My boyfriend was disgusted by what I had gone through, and refused to sleep with me. He cheated on me with a high-school student. I left him.

I started learning more about women's rights. I got more volunteer hours over four months than I got over all four years in high school, because I wanted to keep busy, I wanted to keep my mind off of what happened. I remembered how passionate I used to be about environmental issues. I got passionate about environmental issues again.

I went back to school. Changed my major to Environmental Studies. Added a minor in Women's Studies. Started dating someone who doesn't judge me for what I went through, who isn't repulsed by the fact that I was raped (in that he isn't repulsed by me as a result of it). He calls me ""fierce"" and ""independent"" - something I definitely wasn't before all this came along.

I'm happier now than I ever have been before in my life, even though my major probably won't get me a lot of money or my parent's approval, even though I'm dating an underemployed would-be comedian, not the son of my dad's business partner. Even though I was raped. 

My life is good because I was raped. Because being raped forced me to open up my eyes and refocus my life. I don't judge others anymore, not under any circumstances. I like who I am, and I'm proud of who I am.

I wish I was brave enough or strong enough to admit that to people outside of the internet. Admitting that I'm a good person solely because of a terrible trauma doesn't make me feel like a good person.

I'm frightened that I will spend the rest of my life screaming inside for another line so I can see something other than fat, ugly, and unworthy.

He enjoys wearing high heels and owns more than me probably and he also likes me to wear high heels as much as possible. He also likes to wear stockings/tights and leggings as well as skirts. He doesn't like wearing make up however he does like to wear fake nails and paints his toe nails. 

Recently he shaved his legs so they would look better in heels. I just don't know how to feel about this. He assures me he is straight but has told me in the past that he sometimes feels like he should be a woman. He insists that he doesn't actually want to be a woman but does so that he could wear heels all the time with it being acceptable. 

We've been together for almost 7 years and over the years it has progressed from just the heels which I completely accepted to the tights and the skirts and the nails.

I spoke with my boyfriend tonight. He has assured me that he does not want to become a woman however sometimes feels it would be easier to be a woman as he could then freely wear high heels.

Early this morning, I had my first sexual experience ever with a 34 year old woman.",370,138,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1imquc/i_am_a_15yearold_boy_early_this_morning_i_had_my/,"I don't know where else to go with this. There is no one I can tell. If I were to tell my mother, she would hate my father even more than she already does. If I were to tell my father, he would lose any shred of respect he has for me. And I fear my friends would judge me and lose respect for me as well. So I'm here. I guess I'll tell the story.

I am currently working with my father, helping him and his company set up all the audio-visual aspects of an annual sales conference. This is the third year I've done this. Last time I was here, I had a ""girlfriend."" I am hesitant to call her a girlfriend because we met on xbox live and had never once met. I loved her nonetheless. She was my first girlfriend. Anyways, our relationship ended rather painfully shortly after last year's conference and I never really got over her. During last year's conference, I finally obtained the means to videochat with her. The memories of speaking to her face to face were painful ones to relive this time around. So I was pretty lonely and upset for the beginning of the conference. Until last night that is.

Last night, after 16 hours of arduous work, my dad, his boss, one of our co-workers, and I went up to the boss's suite to drink some moonshine my dad had purchased in Tennessee. Drinking with my dad was nothing new, I had done it before. But never too much. And certainly not moonshine. I had a couple shots while my dad got buzzed and our co-worker and boss got shitfaced. When the conversation started to lean a bit towards the raunchy side, my dad pulled the plug. I walked him to his room and he went to bed.

I then went to the hotel lobby to get on the internet with my computer. By this time, it was already about two in the morning. I browsed reddit for a while until I decided it was time to go to sleep. I packed up my computer and headed for the elevators when I saw her. My co-worker. Let's call her Jane. Jane is gorgeous. I've known her for three years now. I always knew that under that professional, ""sexy-librarian"" exterior is a wild, kinky, uninhibited animal. You can tell from the way she acts with her fiance. She was obviously completely hammered. She invited me to come with her to her room to get some things, then head back up to the boss's suite for some more moonshine. I have no idea what I was thinking. But I went with her. Cautiously.

As we walked back to her room she revealed to me that she had spent the night with a woman the night before and we were going to see if she was still in the room to get some weed from her. This excited me for a number of what are most likely obvious reasons. We get into the room and the woman was gone. She went into the restroom and I sat on a bench. She left the door open as she walked into the restroom to use the toilet and spoke to me through a mirror that allowed me to look directly at her. I had never seen a naked woman I'm not related to in my life before that moment. I was instantly aroused, even despite the strange nature of our communication. She exited the restroom wearing only her shirt and a thong. She slowly put new pants on, obviously noting my close observation.

She proceeded to lay down on the bed and begin to talk to me. She asked me what we had in common. For a good 30 minutes, we discussed religion, politics, drugs, sex, our opinions of society. Jane and I are very similar in a lot of ways. After our talk, we got up to head back up to boss's room. We got up there and Boss was quite obviously just as far gone as Jane. He was a little more mindful though and refused to give me anymore booze. Jane handed me her glass and I drank about half of it. Boss noted the promiscuity Jane was flaunting and took it as opportunity to get laid. He said goodnight and told me to head to bed. I didn't really want to, as by that point I was buzzed myself and pretty hot and bothered by the site I beheld in Jane's room. However, I was also quite anxious and nervous about the entire situation. I had never experienced anything even remotely like that before. It seemed Jane already had a plan of her own, because she rejected Boss's propositions and chose instead to follow me out.

She held my arm supposedly to help her walk, though it was apparent that she was perfectly capable of handling her liquor and just wanted an excuse to touch me, for whatever reason. I intended to walk her to her room on the first floor, then retire to my own on the fourth floor, where my fourteen-year-old sister was already fast asleep. Despite my arousal, I was still somewhat in my right mind. Until we reached her room, that is. She opened her door and pulled me in after her. I sat on the bench as she sat on the bed. She said, ""You might want to take off your shoes, I doubt they'll be very comfortable to sleep in."" I told her that I couldn't sleep there, my dad would not be pleased with that at all. I don't quite remember how, but somehow she convinced me to remove my shoes and move onto her bed.

I sat on the very edge so she couldn't tell how fast my heart was beating and how deeply I was breathing. She gradually shifted herself over to me where she began to caress my leg. I laughed a little and she realized I was ticklish. She pushed me off of the bed and started to tickle me. I resisted, but she was strong. She focused her touch between my legs. In an attempt to stop her, I pulled her off of the bed next to me. It worked. However, she then pulled me up onto the bed with her and, as I lay down to prevent her from tickling me any more, she wrapped herself around me, positioned my head between her breasts and her legs. She asked me if I enjoyed it. I was speechless. I told her I didn't know. She said she thought I did. I told her I thought we would both regret it the next day. She assured me she was very much aware of what was happening and that she would not regret it as long as no one else knew. In all of my anxiety and arousal, I agreed to remain quiet. I knew my dad would kill both of us if he knew.

She rolled over and pulled me on top of her. She asked me if I had ever kissed a girl. I told her no. She laughed and told me she wasn't sure if she wanted to take that from me. She asked me what I wanted. It took a little coercion but eventually I admitted I wanted to kiss her. She said that she wasn't seeing any evidence of that. I had no idea if it really was what I wanted, but I immediately pressed my lips to hers. We kissed... vigorously. Her tongue went deep in my mouth and wrapped around mine. It lasted for a while. I migrated to her neck as she pulled my shirt off. I pulled hers off as well. She told me to unhook her bra. I obliged, my hands shaking. She grabbed my hands and moved them to her breasts. I caressed them. Eventually, I lied down on the bed and she rested her head in the space between my neck and shoulder. I continued to massage her chest until we both fell asleep.

I woke up at 4:30 in the morning, got dressed, and slipped out. I was immediately overcome with guilt. More so than I ever have been. It was horrible. I wandered around the hotel, trying to make sense of the morning's events. Eventually, I retreated to my room and browsed reddit on my phone to take my mind off of it until I fell asleep. My hands shake as I type this. I now have to go back to work and face Jane and my boss and my dad. I am having trouble breathing. I don't know what to think or say or do. Please help me.

Edit: Paragraphs at /u/AliceA's request. Minus indentations. My tab doesn't seem to work.

Update: So we're about half way through the work day. I'm taking a lunch break now. I've been keeping up with replies on my phone, now I'm ready to sit down and reply. I have seen ""Jane"" several times throughout the day, occasionally she will come and speak to my dad while I am with him. Not once has she acknowledged me or even made direct eye contact with me. I believe my prediction of her regret was accurate. Avoiding her at all costs has become rather difficult.

Also, my boss must have mentioned my second trip to his suite to my father. My dad asked when I went to bed last night. I told him it was late because I was on the computer in the lobby. He said, ""I heard you were hanging out with Jane."" I panicked and responded quickly with something along the lines of ""Yeah, she came down to the lobby so I walked with her for a bit."" He asked if I went into Jane's room. I told him no. ""Why would I go in her room?"" ""Well, I don't know but I don't want you hanging out with them when I'm not around."" He seems to have let it go for now. I'm still not sure how much he really knows.

I'd like to thank everyone that has supported me in this thread. Even if it's not true, I feel like you all, people whom I've never met or even spoken to before, actually care. That makes me happy. I'd like to extend even greater thanks to /u/AliceA. Her reply gave me the first moments of easy breathing I experienced today. I head back home tomorrow. I've decided to try not to let this consume me. I don't want it to affect me or traumatize me or anything like that. So I'll learn from my mistake and move on, put this whole ordeal behind me. I'll find someone who I can experience a real first kiss with soon enough.

Again, thank you all.

Update #2: Okay, back from another session of working, ready to address questions and all that. First, people seem to think I am not actually 15. I pride myself on my ability to use correct grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Hence, I strive to exhibit that ability whenever possible. If that means you don't believe my story, I can understand your doubt but it really doesn't concern me. I see no reason to lie on a confessions subreddit with a throwaway account created specifically for this post anyways, as /u/SteampunkHedgehog pointed out. Most people here seem to genuinely care and want to help. If you want to call out potential liars, be my guest. If anyone knows of a way I can confirm my age without revealing my identity, let me know. 

So, since I have returned to work, our paths have crossed once more. She acknowledged me, albeit shortly and once again without eye contact. The night isn't over yet, so we'll see how things go.

And regarding those calling me names and telling me to ""man up"" because I got to touch boobs and I should be happy... Maybe I should. What she did was wrong, I know that. But I did consent to it. I was into it. That might be apparent from some of my descriptions of the event from the original post. But none of that changes the fact that I am NOT happy. I am still shaky. Still nervous. Still ridden with guilt. (Less than earlier thanks to some of these replies) So somebody tell me that. Why does it hurt? Why don't I feel like bragging about it? I just don't know.

Last year, exactly one year ago tonight, my friend and I were at a party. I wasn't that drunk, just a little buzzed. My friend (Bud) was pretty sober. I remember we were trying to get dates to our fraternity event for the next week. Stupid shit. We didn't have a care in the world.

Bud and I did everything together since we were 3 years old. We grew up as brothers, and we never had an argument. Ever. I hear that some friendships have their times when things get a little murky or heated, but we never did. I loved that boy with every fiber of my being, and I would have given my life for him. If he would have just let me know.

Bud and I, while being two frat guys, were pretty ""alternative"" while in college. Not your typical polo-wearing guys. We liked 4chan, Reddit, enjoyed watching movies with friends on Saturday nights, rarely went out to ""parties,"" and just had fun. Our friends were friends with each other. The two of us also had a dark sense of humor. 

I would often say, ""Oh, man, I have an organic chemistry exam in the morning. I'm going to kill myself."" And we'd laugh about it. We made remarks like that, being two stupid idiot dumbasses. 

So, one year ago tonight, at the party, I was talking to this really pretty girl. I don't even remember her name. It was really loud, but Bud dragged me away from it all and had this weird look on his face. I can't explain it. But he told me that he needed to get home, and didn't want to be alone. I was sober enough to know that he was probably drunk off his ass, so we caught the bus and headed out.

When we got back to our apartment, Bud laid down and I asked him if he was okay. He told me to come sit beside him, and I did. He wrapped an arm around me, and started laughing. Then he told me, ""I have an exam tomorrow. I think I'm going to kill myself.""

But he stopped laughing. I laughed, because we were in the same class. He looked up at me with clear eyes. Completely sober. Crystal. Clear. I think a part of me knew he meant it? But I also thought he was drunk. I told him to go to bed. He didn't want me to leave right away, but I was tired and had an exam that morning. 

I woke up the next morning and his door was locked. I knocked, but I knew inwardly that something was wrong because he *never* (under any circumstances) locked his door. I went and got our landlord (after dragging him - literally - out of bed) so he could unlock his door.

And Bud was in bed. He looked like he was asleep, but I saw the empty bottle of pills on his nightstand and I knew right away that he was gone. No one had to tell me. 

Bud, I'm so sorry. I wish you were here. I wish that I had listened to you, and I'm so sorry for making suicide a joke. I never meant it in that way. I love you, Bud, but at the same time I fucking hate you for doing this to me. I fucking hate you so much. Fuck you. Fuck YOU!

And I'm sorry that this is so fucking long, but I needed to say this. I'm not religious, but I hope Bud is there. I hope he sees. I hope he knows that I think of him every single day.

That being said let's go back to when we first started dating in high school, I was 18 and going into my senior year, she was 17 and a starting her junior year.. Everything was great, we had plenty of sex and we both enjoyed getting high, drinking beer and just the whole ""party life"" in general... Well, that summer she had to house-sit for a family member that was taking an extended vacation so she could take care of their pets.. My best friend and I (let's call him ""Jay"") would go over there a lot so we could hang out, smoke cigarettes, drink beer &amp; get high... Well, back then I had a habit of drinking til I absolutely passed out &amp; wouldn't remember a thing from the night before, one night I did this &amp; I woke up alone on the couch around 2AM and had to piss badly.. Well as I was walking down the hall I heard a noise coming from one of the bedrooms and stopped to listen, what I heard was the sound of sex coming through the door.. It didnt hit me at first that we were the only 3 people in the house until I got down on the floor and peeked under the door and saw Jay on top of my gf banging the hell out of her.. For some reason I felt strangely turned on.. Now I consider my dick of average size (about 6"") but Jay was hung like a fucking mule (over 9"") and she was enjoying every bit of it, after about 15-20 mins they finally finished &amp; I crept back downstairs and got back on the couch, my gf got in the shower &amp; then got in her bed while Jay stayed in the other bedroom.. Needless to say I couldn't sleep the rest of that night &amp; actually wound up fapping to the memory of it. The next day they both acted perfectly normal &amp; we all went about our days, that night I purposely got drunk (but not as drunk as they thought I was) and acted like I passed out again.. Well, after about an hour and a half they started making out and retreated to the bedroom, I went back up, peered back under the door and saw Jay sitting on the bed and my gf on her knees blowing him, after about 5 minutes of this she got up on the bed and they started doing it doggy-style.. I began to fap to this laying on my side on the floor, I finished way before they did so I fapped again while they were still going at it... Anyway, it went on like this for the rest of that summer, with me acting like I passed out &amp; them fucking half the night while I watched and fapped laying on the floor in the hallway.. the thing is that my gf and I were still having regular sex during this time also, like there would be times where there were just the two of us &amp; we would have sex 2-3 times that day, then that night she would have sex with him too and then shower and come lay back on the couch or the bed with me, eventually summer was over, school started back, Jay got his own gf and he and I drifted apart... The bad thing is that 20+ years later I still think about this (sometimes while she and I are having sex) and it really turns me on.. Is this weird? I've never told anybody about this.. Any and all comments would be appreciated

1357195334.0,235,self.confession,15vjvc,I was violently raped last summer. I know I'm supposed to feel traumatized and everything but the truth is I feel great.,304,69,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15vjvc/i_was_violently_raped_last_summer_i_know_im/,"For reasons that will become clear shortly I have to be vague with a lot of details with this post.

I'm in my mid 20s and work for a small company as a receptionist. Most of my coworkers are men. From day one I was getting hit on by a lot of the guys but it's in my nature to want to be the Cool Girl so I just went with it. They all knew I had a long time boyfriend who I live with so most of the flirting &amp; sexist remarks were just in good fun. They would try to embarrass me and I'd just roll with it and give it back. Honestly, none of these guys ever thought I was serious in my flirtations and I knew they weren't serious either.

All except for Randall (that's not his real name). He gave me a bad vibe from day one. He was always quiet and didn't join in the breakroom banter like the other guys but the way he looked at me was always disconcerting. Also, he was older than most of the others and looked like a person with a bad past. I eventually found out that he'd been in prison for attempted murder of his second wife about fifteen years ago. I thought that was just a work rumor but it turned out to be true. Even though I didn't believe it he still gave me the creeps.

One day my boss asked me if I could stay late to finish a new database entry project. This was not unusual. I often stay late at work and sort of rely on the overtime that provides. That particular day I didn't finish up until about eight, long after everyone else had left. As usual I went around to make sure the warehouse had been locked up, turn off the lights, all of that.

While in the warehouse I was attacked by Randall. It turns out he had waited the entire time for me to come back there (the doors separating the warehouse from the front office lock automatically after 5 and only a couple people, myself included, have the key). He grabbed me and started calling me a bunch of filthy names. He hit me so hard I was certain he broke my jaw (he didn't but he did chip three of my teeth). I was so stunned by the sudden attack I barely made a sound.

He tore at my clothes after that leaving them in tatters. He held me down with one hand around my neck while he mauled my body with the other. I was absolutely terrified. I honestly thought he wanted to kill me. But I do admit that for some reason, the adreneline the confusion the whatever, my body did respond in ways I wouldn't have dreamed.

I've been told this isn't unheard of. Some say it's the body's way of defending itself during a rape so that the damage is minimized. But to be honest it was more than that for me. The thing I can't tell anyone is that I actually had several orgasms during the assault even though the actual rape didn't last very long.

Don't get me wrong: as soon as he was gone I was a crying mess and the first thing I did was call 911. And I was in severe pain, espeically my jaw/teeth, my vagina, and my breasts (he mauled the hell out of them) among other things. I was in the hospital for two days and did everything I was expected to do. Randall was arrested and pleaded guilty to two of the four counts he was charged with. At the last minute he changed his mind about some other counts he was charged with and so there will be a trial but everyone tells me it will be a slam dunk case. I probably don't even need to testify.

Everyone in my life, from my boyfriend to my parents to my friends, thinks it's weird that I'm basically back to my old self already. They don't say that, but I can tell. My dad doesn't understand why I don't sue the company and is outraged I still work there (I got a long paid leave after the assault but I did return). My boyfriend keeps trying to get me back into therapy. All my friends, especially my male friends, treat me totally different.

The worst thing is that I even fantasize about rape now, which is supposed to be common unless you've actually been violently raped the way I was. I asked my boyfriend if he'd be interested in doing some light bondage with me awhile ago and he freaked out. In fact, he's become so timid in bed that it's like he either sees me as damaged goods or he's worried I'll freak out if he shows the least amount of agression.

I feel so guilty about not being traumatized by what happened that I have actually forced myself to cry while recounting the attack. As in, if I make myself appear messed up people will accept me. If I don't, they'll think something's really wrong.

And yes I've been in therapy. I hear this crap all the time about how I'm still in shock but I'm really not. When Randall forced himself on me I stopped struggling for the most part and just enjoyed myself. There was something very carnal and amazing about that but how can I explain that to a doctor? Or to a detective? Or to my loved ones?

I wonder if there are soldiers who see some horrible things or have horrible things happen to them and later feel this way: like, something must be wrong with them for not being fucked up by it. Everyone knows the PTSD soldier and we all feel bad for him. But are there soldiers who just shrug and say 'Yeah, it was fucked up but it was sort of fun.' ?

I am a telephone counsellor for a line that specialises in crisis support, especially suicide intervention. In my time I feel I have done some good. I have gotten people to flush away their pills, contact loved ones and ask for help, climb over the fence away from the train tracks, unload their guns and generally increase a callers immediate safety.

Suicide for many is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and is a natural inclination for those that feel overwhelmed and have had enough. I have had hundreds of suicidal callers that were resolved over the phone. I admire the strength of those that survive their darkness and persevere.


Not to boast, but I have had praise from many other counselors over the years. I sometimes am called into classes to teach counseling techniques and have sit-in students to listen to my calls, and get positive feedback. I believe I am a good counselor.

For a long time now, I have struggled with just not wanting to live. I feel my daily experience of this is what makes me an effective support for those struggling with suicide. It helps me be present with callers. Often I am not down, and I still want to die. Day to day, hour to hour, it is always there. All the ways of doing it – as a fantasy. Callers often throughout a call begin to see value in themselves, where previously there was none. They begin to see themselves as worthy of living. I love guiding people through this, and admire all these people, but it is not a transition I have ever felt, and seems alien to me. At best, I can fake feeling like I am worth living, often to get through everyday social discourse. 

Disclaimer to those alarmed: I will not commit suicide. Nor am I suicidal at the moment, and this is not a plea for help. If anything, this struggle will help me with my job. My past suicide attempts are behind me and I am safe. I am not at risk.

And now I'm not. I don't know what I believe anymore to be honest, but I am not a Christian. I am not looking for some encouraging words or prayers to go back to church or something because I am happier now than I have ever been. 
I have realized I am now able to fully embrace the wonderful beautiful people that are in my life. As a Christian, I wasn't condescending or judgemental, (or at least not openly) but I was always noticing how dark others lives are, or how unfulfilled they seemed. That's what myself and my other Christian friends talked about, the non-believers in our lives that we were currently witnessing to and praying for. 
After renouncing Christianity I am able to accept my friends for who they are. The time I spend with my friends, I am enjoying them and no longer trying to manipulate / win them over.

Now I am able to be in a wonderful loving relationship filled with awesome premarital sex in the home we share together. 
I can follow my passion and pursue a career in art without worrying about how that life-goal glorifies God. 
I can feel and look pretty without worrying if I'm stumbling my Christian brothers. 
I can spend some time doing shallow materialistic hobbies that aren't church related, including dressing well and painting my nails.
And last, but certainly not least, I can stop condemning gays! I never thought that part was ok. 

EDIT: for me this was a confession because I have never said aloud or expressed my new mindset/realization. Its embarrassing for me personally because I spent YEARS arguing for my beliefs, ready to do anything for Christianity and fully believing that it was the 0NLY key to true J0Y. For context, no one in my family is religious. I joined the church on my own merit and was a practicing Christian for like 7ish years.

He was a fantastic, fun person, and we just hit it off from the start. For about two years we were practically inseparable. He lived about forty minutes away, so we hung out mostly at youth group, and he would often come over and we'd play Metal Slug and talk about PewDiePie. That was until he started telling me about how he had downloaded this new music software, and he was making electronic music and uploading it to Newgrounds. 

At first, it was shit. Absolute shit that i had to listen to as his friend for about a year. We would critique together and decide how to make the songs better. He got much better, to the point of developing a small internet following. This following fed his ego to the point of deciding that it would be in his best interest to devote all his time to making music. That meant shutting out important people in his life, like me.

As we stand now, he has far surpassed ten thousand facebook likes on his page, and is rapidly making money with both his music and merchandise. It's exploded to the point of him DJ'ing at conventions with thousands of people cheering him on. I'm happy for his success, but Jesus dude, you can't call me once in awhile? I've reached out to you so much, and I don't exist to you anymore. If you'll go see another friend of ours that literally lives ten minutes away, you won't pick up the phone and tell me you're nearby? 

It's shitty that fame and money and fans have corrupted you to the point of that seemingly being all there is to your life. At this point, I highly doubt our friendship could ever be what it was, but i'd really fucking appreciate a call or text now and then. We used to hang out a lot, and I miss that.

We were sleeping over that week for the holidays, and her high school aged sister kept flirting with me. I was an addict then so I only really cared about myself and I didn't pick up on other peoples signals well. 

In the middle of the night I snuck out of the room into her sister's room. She was going with it, we were making out, and things were getting heated, we get naked.

Im a convicted sex offender. My girlfriend kept contact with me through jail and wanted to continue our relationship. I was no longer on drugs. Her sister wrote me a letter saying her family will support me because they knew my actions were of an addict. 

I knew the truth. Yes I was an addict, but that wasn't why I did it, I did it because I didn't care about anyone but myself.

Dated girlfriend again but it didn't last long. sister still contacts me occasionally. Feels guilty and said she didnt want any of that to happen to me she just didn't want to have sex. nothing good can come to talking to her though so I dont engage her

I Fear I'll become homeless, either because my parents cannot stand that I've been such a useless wreck these past years or that I'll come out and they will hate me for bringing shame to them which is a very likely possibility, and it will hurt because I really do care for them despite it all.

Coming out is not an option at least until I am a bit more independent, and trying to reach that point has been terrifying to say the least.


I Don't know if I'll check back on this post because seeing my dilemma in words is pretty overwhelming. But I'd like to thank you for being an open forum to release some of this weight off my shoulders.

We exchanged e-mails multiple times and I would find out he was, in fact, an esteemed English professor at a nearby (major) college.

I was so nervous, but he offered me some wine. After two glasses, I got loosened up and he offered me a massage. The massage was nice and it turned into a handjob, and eventually a blowjob. It was my very first time with another man, but it felt so good. I have never done anything to him, besides touch his penis once. However, I do occasionally stop by his place whenever I'm feeling sort of horned up. He gives really great head and I feel really comfortable. We even discuss literature and movies at times.

I was the fat girl in elementary school. I was the fat girl in middle school. I was the fat girl in high school. I'm a fat girl in college. It's always been there. 

I've been on every diet program you can imagine. I've tried going to the gym. I've stuck to both things and lost a little weight, but it tends to me hopeless in the end.

So I turned it around for myself. Most of the world may cringe in disgust at my body, but there are a lot of people out there who love it. 

It started off with me being broke. I was (and still am) working a minimum wage job while I go to school. There is a lot of bad blood between my parents and I. I had to get out at any cost, but what I was making just wasn't enough to live outside of their house. Then I saw an ad on a porn site looking for fat models. 

My body type is slightly odd. I have a very fat stomach and large thighs, with small breasts. Still, I sent an email to the people who run the site with a few face shots, and I described my body. They liked it. I sent a few body shots when they responded to me. The rest is kind of history. 

I'm a fat fetish cam girl these days. I can make upwards of a hundred bucks for 2-3 hours of work. If you do that everyday...It adds up after a while, on top of the money I make at my day job. 

No one knows. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone of what I really do. But I've gotten comfortable making that extra money. It gets tricky when I have to deal with my family pressuring me into losing weight. A major source of income comes from my weight. I don't want to lose that. 

It can be hard. People are not always nice. I've been torn down a lot of being a fatty, though what people like that are doing paying money to see me I don't know. Still in a way it's built up my confidence a lot. These people like my body. They're willing to pay money to see all the rolls and bulges I've been ashamed of my whole life. 

I know I should quit. I should try to get healthy. But it's hard to leave something like that behind. They tell me I'm beautiful. I make a good deal of extra income for very little work. Most of all though, people tell me I'm beautiful.

I know it's not real. I know it's a fetish, and most of those men would not be caught dead with me on the street. Been there, done that in real life too many times to count. I can't help it though.

I usually tell everyone that I'm just dancing as a hobby, and I rarely tell anyone in college (major: chemistry).

But in reality, I dance because I had a dream when I was 10 or so of being a professional danseur. My parents didn't let me dance though. I never got approval. 

Now, I've been dancing for only 3 months and I feel like it's so futile and that I'm wasting my time. I'm not unatheletic, so I don't really need the exercise. In fact, I've been doing weightlifting/athletics since I was 13. I still do my routines. I'm fine in the exercise department.

I feel extremely foolish for having let my regret take me this far. It's pretty silly to be standing around a bunch of younger girl teens who've got serious futures in dance, whereas mine is pretty much shot. 

I just don't know how to get over it. I have other dreams, other projects, other hobbies which are more promising. But for whatever reason I can't over ballet. I feel like I'm floundering though and wasting my money and precious youth at the same time.

After careful research I picked out an older seasoned pro ""provider"" (early 30s) since the thought of hiring someone my age or younger is frightening for some reason. I sent her a text message and she asked me some basic questions. After that we set up an appointed at her incall (her place).

You know the type, argues with the teacher, has really strong religious attitudes (a bit out of place in a science class), brings up his religious beliefs all the time. Not the worst person ever, just a really fucking annoying dude. 

I facebook stalk him a little, figuring he's probably got some stupid young-earth-creationist bullshit there to laugh at. 

Google searching his name brings up a sex offender registry entry. No way. I found one from out of state with a photo, it's the same guy. Arrested in the 80s and 90s for sodomy, molestation, all stuff with a minor.

At this point I'm not even thinking about how irritating he is in class, I'm just feeling like fucking Sherlock Holmes, like I just caught a criminal. Out of state registry even says he's delinquent, hasn't checked in. I'm feeling like Batman. 

I set up an anonymous email address, use TOR, connect through public wifi, all that. I send out an email to everyone in my class (CC at the beginning of the term leaked everyone's emails to each other) including the professor. Includes link, description of his crimes from court records I googled up. 

Send it off, feeling like a motherfucking crime fighter. Just to do my civic duty, I decide to send one out to the sex offenders division of my local police department, in case they just want to check up on the guy or whatever. 

Class is on Monday, I'm excited to see if he'll be there, or if he'll get arrested, dragged away in chains like the scumbag he is. Monday rolls around, he's not in class. I'm feeling pretty smug, like a goddamn superhero.

I get an email like an hour later from the police department, sent to my throwaway email.

Really nice lady explains that Mr. SexOffender has been keeping up with his parole, the online databases are just out of date, he's voluntarily on chemical castration and attends bi-weekly therapy and group therapy. She says that she's sorry I feel unsafe around him, but that he's one of the best behaved offenders she's met, he self polices really well, attends church all the time and tries to help other offenders keep themselves in check. 

She even told me he's going back to school.

Friend in registration tells me he's no longer registered. New, in state updated offender registry lists him as delinquent again. 

Sure he molested kids or whatever, and I know the recidivism rate is impossibly high and that most offenders never recover, but it's been a year now and every time I think about it I feel guilty.

Edit 1: Edited for clarity.

Edit 2: To address what his actual crimes were, I don't want to go into too many details but two specific counts listed (not all of the counts listed, just two examples) on his sex offender pages (two states) were: lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under 14, and forced penetration with a foreign object of a minor under 16. So it wasn't a case of public urination, or anything of that sort. At the time he committed his crimes, he was actually sexually violent. But, as one commenter mentioned, the last charge was over 20 years ago.

I started university 2 years back and had, what I think was, a pretty standard first semester. Everything was great; I had friends, decent grades, cool professors, and my tuition was paid for, but I was living at home to save money. In hindsight this was a bad idea, but at the time it was working out.

Fast forward to second semester. I charge in headstrong, ready to kick ass like last semester, and for a month or so I did. Slowly, however, I started up a habit of skipping class. By skipping class, I don't mean blowing it off to go chill or whatever, I mean just sitting in the library doing nothing. I have pages of nothing but sequential numbers scribbled as small as I could write them. I felt I had to write these numbers. Also, about this time I began obsessively writing lists, transcribing anything near enough to read, just notebook upon notebook filled with nonsense. I thought that I was just cracking under the stress, so I dropped a class and tried balancing out my workload. No good, I stopped going to classes altogether. Anxiety was eating at me, because I knew that I would fail and that would most likely result in getting the boot from the university. Ultimately, after swallowing half a bottle of acetaminophen in a failed suicide attempt, I decided to see a campus councilor. She offered me medical withdrawal for severe depression with obsessive compulsive behaviors and gave me the offices and people I had to see.

You see, I had actually right there managed to salvage the situation, and was on the fast track to turning it around. All I had to do was request the withdrawal and ask for my parents' insurance information so I could go to the campus doctor and get a prescription for some medication. The problem was no one but myself and that councilor even knew that there had been any problems with me. I didn't tell anyone. Not my parents, not my sister, not my friends. To the best of their knowledge I was enjoying a second semester just as fruitful as the first. Understand that I don't trust anyone with anything and 99% of the time I have a strict policy of never committing thoughts or ideas to paper or writing. This also comes with the obligatory 'never discuss your feelings ever'. As you can imagine I'm a riot at parties.

Well, I decide to put off the telling people about my problems bit and go straight to the office to request a medical withdrawal and as soon as I enter the building I can just feel my mental upswing falling back fast. By the time I get where I was headed I'm physically shaking and I can see a group of people in there laughing. I can hear their laughter and I just can't do it. I keep walking. I forget the whole thing and decide to go another route. Completely stand up my next appointment with the councilor and keep telling everyone that everything is hunky-dory.(There is no way I was ever actually going to get medication because I'm wary of doctors and haven't been to one since I was 14.)

Now I'm sitting here. 2 years later. Looking over my shoulder, hiding from everyone's eyes. Everyone still thinks I'm in college. I don't talk to my friends anymore, I don't have a job, I still live at home. I used to spend days walking around aimlessly, but I kept getting the feeling that I was being followed, so I limited myself to campus, and the feeling persisted, so now I try to hide all day until my 'classes' are over and hope no one notices me. This tears at me every day the fear and anxiety gnaw at me all the time and I just keep lying to my family and tell them that school is going great. I've spent my tuition savings on trying to make it look like I have money from a part time job, you know, clothes, gifts, food, that kind of stuff.

Since this is a throwaway confession I guess I'll also admit that I do have some bad hallucinations sometimes, but I don't like to talk about it (actually I never talk about it). I used to have pets. We have family pets that get nothing more than an occasional frustrated toss from me, but the animals I kept in my room are all dead. Six pets in three years. I keep making up excuses for how the died to my family members, but I killed them all and it sucks because some of the I genuinely cared about and absolutely adored and now they are nailed to trees in the woods behind our house. 

I realize this is some not good stuff and I guess I'm sitting here crying because it's taken me a long time to even admit to myself that I can't take care of this. I'm looking at two options right now, either packing my shit and leaving(one summer I bought a bunch of backpacking stuff because for some reason I thought that I was capable of that), or eating some humble pie.

Ever since the first week, people (always boys) have complained about an odd smell that appears in the bathroom sometimes. It's been described as a mix between putrid milk and Indian food diarrhea. It appears every few hours, and tends to linger for about an hour or so, during which time some people are literally unable to use the bathroom. The girls in the dorm tend not to really discuss it but it's a regular topic among the boys. They all jokingly accuse each other of being the one to leave that putrid smell, and they all have theories as to which boy it is that leaves it.

Here's the thing. I have stomach problems, which I do take medicine for, and while it makes it far more manageable than if I wasn't on the medication, it still can be pretty awful. I know how bad it smells, and I'm always really careful to wash my entire butt/crotch area every time I poop to make sure that the smell doesn't linger. As far as I know, nobody knows it's me. I have to live like, 6 more months with these people though. I don't see how I can possible go that long keeping up my secrecy.

1375271919.0,218,self.confession,1jez8r,"I was one of ""those"" teachers (x-post /r offmychest)",278,60,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jez8r/i_was_one_of_those_teachers_xpost_r_offmychest/,"I was one of ""those"" teachers that had a relationship with a student and it justifiably ruined my life.
I had just turned 25; she was 18 and already graduated. During the school year she would often come to my office hours for assistance with her assignments, and I'd help her unassumingly, as I did for many other students. Eventually I became enthralled by her ardor, the sincere effort with which she put towards her work and life, and which I, a new teacher in his second year, was often too overwhelmed to feel. It became evident that she had a crush on me; I liked the attention and, knowing full well it was wrong, indulged in fantasies about this girl. At the end of the school year, she asked me to sign her year book and I left an encouraging message--I included my phone number and email attached to ""if there is ever anything I can do to help..."" Immediately after she handed me a note saying, ""If there is ever anything YOU need..."" with her number and email.

We kept in contact and had those long, meandering, exploratory conversations that new, deluded lovers do. That March I had just gotten out of a long relationship with the girl I dated throughout college and lived with for a year, which isn't an excuse, but certainly did contribute to my willingness to participate. Within six weeks after graduation, we had a date for her to come to my apartment.

We carried on from July to January. She would visit me on weekends that she came home from school (roughly two hours away) and we would often chat/webcam in between. She predictably ended up ""not feeling the same anymore"" and ended the relationship. And I completely understood why: it was pure fantasy and lust. We were both convinced that each other was something we were not: her that I was someone truly accomplished and I that she was a manic pixie dream girl. Neither was true.

She stopped talking to me and a month later when I tried to contact her I found out she had a boyfriend. It hurt, but I knew it had to happen; a real relationship was just never really feasible for us. What hurt more, and still pains me to this day, two years since this all began, is what happened next.

Over Spring Break, two of her self-righteous friends visited me. How they found out I don't know, but considering we're talking about teenage girls, they were probably told, despite her protests to the contrary. They pretended their visit was to give me Easter candy, but a week later I'd find out that was a ruse and that immediately after they reported the relationship to the administration. Soon after, I was told that I would not be rehired (still un-tenured at this point) with no justification why. My supervisor, who did not agree with the decision, later revealed to me that it was because of a ""rumor"" that I had a relationship with a student. I was devastated. I loved my job, and I was good at it. I had stellar reviews from my superiors, was rated highly on teacher-rating websites and I was popular with the students. None of that mattered in the end.

Fast-forward to now and I am employed in an education-related position, but making far less money. I have been deferring my loans because I can't afford to pay them, and I am scared that I will not be allowed to defer them any longer. I am on track for a promotion that would increase my salary, but since it is a small business it is unclear when I will be able to take over that role. Part of me would like to go back to teaching, but I don't know that I can ever get a teaching job again; even though my record wasn't sullied by my transgression, I was still forced to resign, and it's difficult to explain why I would resign and then go back to teaching so quickly. I don't know what else I'm qualified to do and it has wrecked my self-esteem.

I was empowered as a teacher. I had worked hard to get that job, and in a short time I had earned a very good reputation, ""rumors"" aside. But in moments of weakness, like now, I fall into a terrible negative feedback loop where I ruminate on how I was dumped by a 19 year old; how her next boyfriend had a job straight out of school as a software engineer making 90k+; how I am so mired in responsibilities and debt that even if I could develop the skills to do something else, I lack the time and the means. The original goal was to be a teacher so I could always be reading and writing, and maybe end up writing something I was proud of one day. Now I won't allow myself to write because of the stress from my career and financial situation.

I don't always feel this pathetic. I have a girlfriend who is caring and successful and who sees what I have to offer--she doesn't know about all of this though. I do have the support of my family if I ever need it. I could move back home if need be and pay my debts, as humiliating as it would be, and knowing that it would probably end my current relationship as well. I have the respect of my boss and colleagues, as I am valuable to my current organization, though they don't have the means to compensate me more for that. But then there are nights like these when I wake up at 4am and get to relive my greatest mistake. Even though I probably deserve what I've gotten, I don't think I'm a bad man. I've only ever had the best of intentions, foolish as they may have been.

1342882359.0,217,self.confession,wxaos,"I give ridiculous amounts of money to random women to feel good about myself, and now I'm close to bankruptcy.",271,54,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wxaos/i_give_ridiculous_amounts_of_money_to_random/,"I have an expensive addiction. I give money away to random women, and I do so with alarming regularity. I'm a thirty-something bachelor in a well-paid position within the financial industry. I have a medium-sized city apartment and two cats. Snuffles and Moomoo. I have a disposable income that I have no use for – except for antique telescopes. I collect them.


Consequently, for about two years now, I have spent an unhealthy amount of my time wandering around the city actively looking for women to whom I can hand out my earnings to. It is almost always women in dire straits. Ostensibly homeless, or otherwise downtrodden. I'll typically approach nonchalantly and strike up a conversation. I'll ask them specifically what it is they need; how much is enough? Sometimes it's enough for some food or cigarettes. Sometimes they don't give a reason and just specify an amount. Ten. Twenty. Other times they'll simply ask what I'm willing to give. In these instances, I'll start at fifty. “Will that be enough?” Their initial thoughts, of course, are of a suspicious nature, and are written all over their face. I quickly reassure them that there's no catch. Take it. Walk away. The pay-off is fleeting, but for whatever reason – whether it's sincere altruism, perverse power trip, or simply a desire to be genuinely appreciated for a brief moment – I get an overwhelming sense of gratification when I hand the money to them and witness their emotions progressively evolve: suspicion – incredulity – gratitude – joyousness.


This may only happen once or twice a day, but recently I've discovered websites which allow you to 'choose a woman' to watch via webcam. You can 'tip' them directly in varying amounts and for whatever reason. There's nothing sexual about this. I choose the girls who simply sit there interacting with the people in the chat room. Some sing or dance. One paints watercolours and listens to jazz. I'll sit there and tip them incrementally over the course of the night. Once every half hour or so. Two hundred. Five hundred. A thousand. They receive an instantaneous notification when it's sent. I watch for their expression and bask in their hysterical, animated displays of appreciation. Last night I was connected to a young woman who told the room that she was saving up for her first car. I asked her how much it was. Five thousand pounds. I sent it to her in full, just to see her reaction.


There's no point me attempting to explicate with regard to why I do this. I don't know. It is clearly self-destructive behaviour. Those are the facts as I can best relate them. That payment last night was by no means negligible. I'm now in serious debt and I'm worried about this escalating further.


**TL;DR:** I use most of my salary giving money (hundreds, thousands) to strangers on the street or the internet for reasons which are unbeknownst to myself. I'm now in a dire financial situation, on the verge of losing everything, yet I still continue to do this -- including giving a random woman on the internet (who I'd only spoken to for about 20 minutes) £5000 for a car.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit I:** A bit more background: There was definitely a catalyst for this behavior which I should have perhaps included in the original post. A couple of years ago, one lunch-break, I was coming out of a bookstore on a busy road when I walked past a woman leaning against a taxi, clearly quite flustered, frantically pulling things out of her purse and fumbling with loose change. I heard the taxi driver shouting at her, being really rather abrasive and intimidating. I stopped near enough to hear their conversation pretending to light a cigarette, and on ascertaining that she couldn't pay her fare, walked over and told the driver I'd pay the full amount (not much; maybe twenty-five pounds). He drove off, and this woman, who was so stressed and panicked just a few seconds before, was now positively radiant. She thanked me incessantly and implored me take her phone number so she could later reimburse me, but I never called.

Now, I appreciate most people would feel a certain degree of warm satisfaction having helped another human being out of a trying situation. However, for me, it was more than that. I wanted that feeling *in perpetuity*, and since then, I've always sought out 'opportunities' of this nature. Of course, I do also try and help out people I know – family, friends, colleagues, etc, when they're stuck –, but it's the elements of spontaneity and randomness, the thrill that comes with handing over life-changing sums of money (in some cases) to perfect strangers, to which I find myself so hopelessly enslaved.

**Edit II:** This thread has received more attention than I anticipated, and a lot of questions have been asked, so I'll try to elaborate further. A few months ago, I watched the film 'Shame' and it really resonated with me. For anyone who has seen it, I'm very much like Brandon, but without the nymphomania. I have that corporate, big-city kind of lifestyle, and probably appear quite normal and grounded to friends and people I work with. However, I'm actually quite reticent and private, feigning confidence and charm to appease colleagues and clients.

This, I suspect, will be perceived as quite a sad admission, but I often spend my evenings on my balcony with one of my telescopes, observing the happenings of the great city before me. From my vantage point, I have access to thousands of apartment windows, nightclub entrances, restaurants, alleyways, and so on, and I've witnessed some very interesting/disturbing/amusing things over the years. I'm fascinated by people, but I'm ultimately unable to attain any sort of meaningful relationship with them -- male or female. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon, and I can see as I'm writing this, the streets and bars below are pulsating with activity, whilst I'm here; self-imprisoned in my Ikea-furnished cell.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost two years now. We have been through a lot of shit together and we are in love. I'm 23 years old and she is 21. We have a normal sex life (about 8-10 times a month considering we have been together almost two years that's more than plenty). I'm not a normal person however. I have depression, social anxiety and ADD. I can't give you my life story here so I'll just say that I'm a fucked up individual but on the surface I appear normal and somewhat happy and I really do love and care for my girlfriend. 

I'm not gay. When I masturbate I don't think about men. I don't watch gay porn. I don't fantazise about men. However for the past several months I have been making craigslist postings on m4m looking for gay action. Sometimes I'll get ashamed of myself and delete my alt email accounts and my postings. But I always go back.

I don't know why I do this. I just do it. and it excites me for some reason. I've exchanged emails with dozens of men, but only met up wtih two of them. One was several months ago and I sucked him off in his car. I did not enjoy it. I didn't get a hard on from doing it. I just did it. Without any thought I just got in the car and sucked the hell out of his cock. I even swallowed. After he left I walked back to my house and rinsed out my mouth for several minutes and layed in bed and cried. I even contemplated suicide. I told myself I would never do it again and that I could be a good person and be the man my girlfriend deserves. 

But the next day I was back on craigslist. 
 
Fast forward several months. I made another posting on craigslist a couple days ago ""looking for fun"". I got many emails and this one older guy wanted me to suck him off at his house sometime. He wasn't even that far away. 

I was with my girlfriend the past couple of days. (we live apart, us being young) Today she was very sick and weak. I was holding her hand and we were talking. I was comforting her. She was depressed and sore. I was taking care of her. and just hanging out. Nothing out of the ordinary. I checked my yahoo inbox on my cellphone and that older guy I've been chatting with told me it was okay to come over and suck his cock. So I told her I would be back and I walked over to this house and sucked his cock. I didn't even enjoy it that much. But man did I ever suck the hell out of that cock. I licked it, sucked it, and swallow all the cum. I smiled and told him I would be back sometime. I went back to her house and pretended have been on the phone with a friend for a half hour. She beleived it.

What the fuck? Why do I keep doing this? I'm such a piece of low life shit. I walked out on my sick girlfriend to suck some old guys cock for nothing. I felt nothing as I walked over to this house and knocked on the door. Why does this excite me? I DON'T ENJOY THIS. I'M STRAIGHT. WHY DO I KEEP SUCKING COCK? WHY DO I KEEP CHEATING ON HER?

The next time I saw him, I told him that his girl was good in the sack.  We didn't discuss exactly what happened, but he knew roughly what went on and was ok with it.

Another night like that first one happened where I started out on the couch, then after that, I just started sleeping with her while he was away.

She does give me anal sex and she refuses it to him (he is a lot bigger than me).  He has joked that he's jealous that I've fuck his girlfriend in the ass and he never has gotten to.

He is very jealous of other guys.  He always worries about her cheating.  But for whatever reason, he doesn't worry about me.

The three of us are together a lot, but we never talk about it.  It's just something we do and pretend that we don't.  I like having sex with her, but I'm not romantically attracted to her and I wish the two of them the best.

EDIT: For those that are wondering what happened, I've decided to just post it here in the description to keep you from scrolling around too much because that's no fun. Here it is:

We were that high-school sweetheart kind of relationship to start out with so we had this whole mentality that we would be married after school, have kids, all that crap. I feel like he really used these fake promises in the later stages to keep me roped in. We moved to a whole new town together and it wasn't going well after about a year and that's when the abuse started. It was infrequent and what I personally consider mild in nature, but still present. He would tell me where I was and wasn't allowed to go, I was never invited out with him and his friends (I later found out he was thinking of seeing some girl on the side from our town, which is why I wasn't invited), I wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends or make new ones, etc. etc. Just very controlling behaviour, he literally expected me to sit at home and wait for him to come back whenever he felt like it from wherever he went I got extremely lonely. He asked me to move out, which I at the time tearfully did and got my own place.

Then he stopped taking me out on dates and would make up really stupid excuses to not spend time together. My personal favorite story was when we were at the movies one time, in line for tickets, and all of a sudden he ""felt sick"" and wanted to go home; later on I saw one of his friends had accidentally ratted him out by tagging him in a status at some club at 3 am when he was supposedly ""sick"" hahaha. He would disappear for days on end (his own mother would be calling me asking me where he was much to my annoyance) and then he'd just reappear like nothing happened. This went on for months and then the real abuse started happening; he started to get absolutely hammered when we did hang out and he'd throw me around, yell at me, throw things at me, etc. I was never really scared to be honest, which I'll never understand. This only happened a handful of times (not even), but still. I fought back, although I don't know if I would recommend that idea. He would cry and plead the next day for me not to leave him, which I stupidly didn't. He developed an alcohol and drug addiction as time passed. He'd lie about it even though everyone was worried about him.

I finally had enough when I went to a mutual friends' birthday party a town over at the bar (seperately), it was like we weren't even really together anymore. He got drunk and started hitting on my friend right in front of me, groping her, etc. She flipped out, I flipped out, he flipped out, he drove off drunk in his vehicle and crashed it on someone's farm land. We mutually broke up the next day, however it gets creepier from there. I started hanging out with a work friend and his group of friends that I met through my roommate and he literally stalked us everywhere we went. He started ""seeing"" some single mom with 2 kids that was at least 10 years older than us; she just happened to be my boyfriend's next door neighbor. He would draw all these weird cryptic pictures and leave them stuck all over my boyfriend's windshield, tacked to his and his roommate's house, literally everywhere. It was really creepy, and I was legitimately starting to get freaked out at this point. Then one time we went to a party together at his friend's house and my ex randomly showed up outside the house and proceeded to graphically cut himself in front of the window crying because I wouldn't talk to him and nobody was gonna let him in obviously. Cops were called. 

Believe it or not, it is this same group of friends that got me through this breakup that hang out with him now. They were there first hand for his shit and saw it all. Fuck me, right?

From the time I was 10 and she was 4, all the way up till when I was 18 and she was 12 or 13, I repeatedly molested/raped my sister. The really weird thing is, because of the family dynamic, she just thought I was showing her love...Even twenty years later, she kept telling me that it was NOT a problem, and she even fantasized about it. There was no ""rape"", it was about ""fun"" and I ALWAYS made sure she was having fun. As weird as it sounds.

I was raped by my mother a LOT. So much so, that I honestly it was normal. I have decided not to marry and have had my tubes cut....

I have had a LOT of sex as a 20-30yr old with 18-20yr olds, and as a YOUNG 20 year old, I always found myself hanging out with 14-18 year olds with major daddy issues....

Which led to a LOT of awesome underage sex, and none of them are upset with me....but I know it was wrong...

But there are so many questions I wish I could have asked Missy, my sister...

I mean, she was GENUINELY concerned about my orgasms, as I was her (probably fake) ones.

We were both raped by my mom and her brother. If you've ever watched kiddie pr0n, you have probably seen us.

Is this a one time thing? Or do some women see this as a ""nice"" act by a brother in a similar situation?

I never penetrated her...it was always....I dunno, ""soft"" play? I would come while watching her play with herself, or she might give me that awkward handjob while smiling and waiting so we could go out and swim...

Fuck...Someone? I need to talk to someone....

I know where to get kiddie porn, and I've actually found three videos (from the 70s) of us....

Which made me come buckets....which messed me up...jerking off to me being raped by my mom and her brother...

I just want to chat with someone. I've had YEARS of therapy, but have never gotten the nerve up to tell her that it turns me on....

Damnit. 

***worth a shot, I guess...time to drink this away AGAIN...I know this might sound like I am trying to find damaged women/girls...I just...I dunno....I want to believe my sister...I miss her and loved her

1365463049.0,211,self.confession,1by9cf,Moved to a new place this weekend; I think I just ruined any impressions I may have with my new neighbors,245,34,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1by9cf/moved_to_a_new_place_this_weekend_i_think_i_just/,"So finally after months of being stuck living at home with my dad I finally mustered the means to get a place of my own, a nice spacious apartment that's close to my work, friends and family. I paid my first month's rent friday and officially moved in after I got off work the same day. ""Moving in"" is kind of relative since I don't have any furniture yet, but all my stuff is now up in my new place, including my TV and computer.

I'll be getting most of my big furniture wednesday and I got all of my general house supply shopping done I needed to on saturday/sunday, so sunday night I decide to chill back and use my computer and TV to watch some high quality porn because, well, why not I got my own place right?

So I'm in the middle of my own private porn session playing out on my fairly decent sized TV when I start to hear laughing down the street. Like pretty much everybody else I'm generally neurotic about my porn watching, so instantly my mind thinks it must be directed at me - someone saw me watching porn and is laughing about it. So, right as I compulsively turn my TV off I hear at least 3 cars turn their engines on and drive off down the street. The same time I could hear a general crowd of people chuckling and dispersing in all directions from the street. I had been caught, and not just caught; I turned my TV back on and looked on the other side of the balcony blinds to find that the blinds were projecting with flawless clarity my television screen and porn. The balcony faces the street. I wasn't caught, I was putting on a freaking show. And yes, my apartment is the closest one to the parking lot, where the entire complex enters and leaves.

So, that was last night. I snuck out as quickly as I could this morning for work to avoid any confrontations, but I'll have to run into someone eventually. Uh, is this the end?  There are quite a few families in the neighborhood - is this the kind of thing people get put on watch lists for?

1343288859.0,207,self.confession,x6hik,I cleaned a handicapped man's house naked for two hundred dollars.,249,42,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x6hik/i_cleaned_a_handicapped_mans_house_naked_for_two/,"About two or three years ago I posted an ad on criagslist for cleaning houses naked. My ex boyfriend was always very concerned about money and also about who worked harder for what they earned. I wanted to prove a point, but I was also growing bored with our relationship. He didn't excite me anymore. He would play video games for hours and would ignore anything I did to get his attention.

Somehow, I thought this would help the situation. I posted that I was a cute 20 year old with brown hair and freckles looking to make a little extra money. It was quickly removed, but I still somehow managed to get hundreds of emails. I was entertained by some of the requests, but none of them seemed ""safe"" to me. The next day I returned to read some more emails to entertain myself when I stumbled across an email from a man named ""Joe"". He mentioned at some point in the email that he was in a wheelchair and also that he had limited use of his hands. He wrote very professionally and seemed very intelligent which was unlike all of the other emails I received. Also, I will admit that him being handicapped made him seem a lot safer than the others. I decided that I would do it. My ex didn't know exactly what I was planning on doing. He was glad I had accepted a second job because I was only working a four day week at the time. Joe said if he liked my cleaning he would ask me to come back weekly or bi-weekly. The extra money would help and It wasn't like I was going to sleep with him or allow him to touch me in any way. That's how I convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong.

After a few phone calls, I drove to Joe's house to clean. I was incredibly nervous, but walked inside anyway. He told me to sit down on the couch so we could discuss what cleaning had to be done. Mostly, he asked me questions and wanted me to ask him questions. After about 20 minutes of awkward conversation he shows me around his house. He had pictures of a very pretty recent ex girlfriend on his refrigerator. She was around 26 and he was 40. When we got to his bedroom he said I'd be cleaning his desk. I noticed that there were a lot of strip club MVP passes on his desk, he made a joke about them and then left to wait in the living room so I could undress. 

It didn't even feel real when I finally stood in front of him naked. He showered me with compliments and we talked as I cleaned his kitchen, bedroom, and closets. The doorbell rang after about an hour and a half. He told me to go back to his room to get dressed and if someone comes inside to pretend I am interviewing to be his live-in assistant. I assumed the person outside was my boyfriend, I felt afraid and ashamed of myself. I thought about how devastated he would be, but it ended up just being one of Joe's friends. He let her in for a couple of minutes and I told her what he had asked me to tell her, but I doubt she believed it.

After she left, Joe ordered pizza. We ate, he paid me and I left. He told me he wanted me to come back next week and I told him I would. I did want to come back, but I ended up telling my ex the truth and he wouldn't allow it.

I lied to my ex, he felt betrayed for awhile. Our relationship recovered, surprisingly. However, eventually, it just became too much for him to handle and he broke up with me. I deserved it. I didn't even want to be in that relationship anymore. We had been together for so long that it just seemed too ridiculous for me to just throw it all away forever. I should have ended it the moment I knew we couldn't be happy together. Instead, I decided to lie just to amuse myself. It was a horrible and fucked up thing to do.

1327431303.0,208,self.confession,ouskz,I messed around with my secretary - nsfw,266,58,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ouskz/i_messed_around_with_my_secretary_nsfw/,"She's not one of these hot secretaries you might see in a dirty film. She's not young. She's several years older than me. But there's just something about her - and always has been. I've known her for many, many years, but it wasn't until recently that we started this ""thing.""

Let me stop and say, it's over now and we both feel bad about it. I miss it however. I want to still do terrible things to her. And I don't know why. Maybe it's the fact that we shouldn't. Maybe it's because she's here and at one point wanted to do terrible things to me. Whatever it is I can't shake it and I really want to.

Back to the story. We were always chatty. Our office is small and there are 1/2 dozen employees so there was always time to get to know one another. We always shared things to each other and got real close. It was almost family-like. But we were just real good friends. Special friends is what she called it sometimes. 

During a particular tough spot at work we hardly got to talk. I was extremely busy and couldn't tear myself away that often to see how she was doing up front. She told me that she missed our chats and I agreed with her. So, I put a little texting program on our computers that we could shoot the shit every so often. We did. We'd complain about the idiots here at work and ""lol"" about things. This went on for a while.

But see, I still had the hots for her for whatever reason. And I never told her. There was something about her that I just wanted to grab a hold of and fuck like mad! Just wipe the conference room table off, plop her down, and give it to her. It was primal.

Also, we're both married. Both of us have been married for over a decade each. We have children. Hell, she has grandchildren. Didn't matter. Actually, I think it made it even more desirable. Just to have this much older lady want to throw it back at me like she's never done before. It made my stomach ache sometimes. I would take it out on my wife in the bedroom sometimes and feel so ashamed after. I mean, screwing my lovely wife while thinking about banging this old, conservative broad back at work. My head would spin.

She always wore slacks to work. Her bottom was round and big. But it was shaped just right and her slacks would stretch perfectly over it - hugging it like I wanted to do. My fantasies would mostly end with her begging me to get behind her and fuck her like mad. I still have those fantasies.

One particular day I got fed up. Or I should say, my pecker got fed up. I was going to tell her exactly how I felt and whatever happened, happened. We were texting back and forth about work and I stopped and told her I needed to tell her something. ""ok,"" she replied.

Then I told her how much she turned me on. How attractive I thought she was. Her body. Her fragrance. Right down to her fingernail polish. And I waited for what seemed like an hour for a reply. She told me how much that meant to her and that she was flattered. And how good looking she thought I was too.

No. No. No. I sent something back even more juicy. I told her about my fantasies with her. Everything. I mean, everything. Then waited again.

She texted me that what I wrote made her ""wet"" just reading it. My heart thumped in my chest. I felt like a kid getting a love note in school - but much more than just ""Do you love me?"" This was a ""Do you want to see my panties!"" note.

From that point on we texted the filthiest, dirtiest things to each other. Shit I would never guess she knew of. She told me things that made me blush. But it was so wonderful. My dick was hard all day and I had to hide it. I went home in pain sometimes. Good pain.

Work was slowing down so our texting went up. We were pretty discreet and tried to be as careful as possible. Sometimes we'd almost get caught if someone came in and a text would pop up. We had codes for people walking the halls and people behind out backs and such so we tried to keep it hidden. 

The secretiveness of it made us even more horny. One time I was writing code for a backup program on one of our servers and was texting her with another computer. I told her I couldn't handle having an erection all day again because this time it was bigger than ever. She told me to prove it. The rest of the staff was in the conference room so I told her to come to the server room and I'd show her. I heard her walk down the hall. When she came in I stood up and pressed my jeans across my erection to show her. Her hand made a b-line directly to it and slid across my pecker - over the jeans. ""Mmmm. Hate to see that go to waste."" I almost lost it. The world emptied and it felt like we were standing alone in space. But I had to shake the feeling and get back to work.

A few days later she decided to come in early. I was already there getting computers going and checking systems like every day. At the time I was in my office and she waltzed straight up to me and started kissing me with eagerness. I kissed back like she was a lost love from years past. My dick stood straight up. Quick. It surprised me. I mean, I'm not young - I'm not old either. But it was like I was 18 again. It hurt. She could feel it since we were pressed so closely together. Again, she slid her hand across it. But she walked away telling me we should stop before it's too late. I walked to my seat, sat down, and pulled it out. Fuck it, I thought. ""Hey. See what you've done?"" She turned and looked. Her hand was on it. I can still feel it now. Slightly cold, but soft. Her rings. The way she slid her hand all the way up over the head and let go. Then she walked out.

A second or so later, she poked her head in and told me that I was much bigger than her husband. Frankly, I didn't know how to take it. I liked it, but the mention of her husband sort of killed it. 

From that point we fondled a lot with each other. She let me suck on her nipples from time to time and rub her beautiful ass. Every so often I would rub her clit or stick my finger in her. Then one day we found out the rest of the office was going to be out of town. We talked about what we could do and couldn't do. ""NO Penetration.""

(I have to hurry up here. I'm getting horny thinking about it again. We're still working together but trying to stay clear of what happened.)

The day before everyone was going to be gone, she decided to wear a skirt - and no panties. ""Come here,"" she texted. Everyone else was preparing for the time away from the office. They were in the conference room going over a slide presentation. So I walked up half expecting to see her hike her skirt up and show me her thong - or something.

Uh ... nope. I guess porn ruined me because for whatever reason her pussy looked nothing like I expected. It was beautiful. So pink. So wonderful. I wanted to drop to my knees and bury my tongue in it. I was also half scared out of my mind. Here she is, no panties, showing me her flower, and actually playing with the petals right here in our office. What kind of wonderfully crazy woman is this? I was so wrought with confusion my dick didn't know what to do.

(oops. she just walked in.) (m'kay)

Anyway. Several times that day I asked to see it and she obliged. It was like she was trying to get me ready for the next day. Even now, I keep wondering what stopped me from licking her flower. I had so much fear going through me. It was childlike. 

Some of you may be hoping that I got my wish - that I fucked her so righteously on her desk that it was like a movie. That's not what happened. God, I wish it did though. But glad it didn't as well. She wore another skirt and as soon as we were both there she was on her desk with her skirt slid up to her hips and that beautiful flower staring at me. My pants came down and I walked over to her with a huge boner. But as soon as I got close, it started going away. Fucking FEAR!!! Everything flashed before me; my wife, my kids, her husband, our employees, my pastor. It was movie-like. A very bad movie about doing the right thing.

But she grabbed my pecker and slid the head of it up and down her lips. I acted as best as I could and went for her breasts - nibbling and sucking away half-heartily. It was right there every time I looked down. Right there about to go in. But I didn't want it to. Not now. So I had to try and stop it. I made some wild lie about how I had to cum just touching her and she told me she wanted to finish me off in the bathroom. So we walked up the hall and she grabbed my dick and started wanking it. It was nice actually. Her hands were soft. He motion was just right. In no time flat I came like a wild cat. Then regret hit me. Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuu.

And since then I've been battling with regret and need. I regret that we let it get that far but I need to go further. I want to go further. I want to eat her pussy like it's never been eaten. I want to make love to her like no other. I want to fuck her like no other. I want to do terrible things to her. But it's never going to happen.  She regrets it too. Many times now she tells me that it will never happen again. We cannot even text like we used to.

Good. I guess. Yeah, I miss it. I miss the craziness. I miss her touch. But it's for the best and above all that I have an awesome wife and awesome kids that I should think about. I'll probably get hanged for this confession. I know I'm a dirtbag. I feel it every day. I'm sorry it happened. But I don't know what I would do if it came down to it and she was showing me that pretty flower again. My mind thinks of proper things to do this time. Better things. Things that would make her beg for more. 

More than likely though, I'd stumble around like a teenager and lose my load in my jeans or something.

tl;dr (You really should read it if you have the time. It took me a while to write.)

**edit: I do want to state again that what I did was wrong. I'm not bragging about the situation. And it did happen. A lot of stuff was left out too because I didn't have the time to type it all out. On the ride home last night guilt overwhelmed me. I felt a lot of shame because the first step I took toward her was a step I should have never taken.**

So I'll be glad to get this off my chest, as I feel like I've been unable to tell anyone. Biologically, I know it's not all that weird--he's basically full grown physically. Emotionally, legally, socially? Yeah, not so much. 

Anyways. I'm a 22 year old female in a loving, semi-long-term relationship with a guy (M/30). He gives me all the care and attention I could want, and our sex life is great. There's no real reason for me to be thinking of another person sexually or romantically. Let's be honest, though: that's not how humans work. 

At the beginning of the semester I moved to a new teaching position where I'm working in a class with 14 to 16 year old mostly boys. I see them twice a week. Let it be known upfront that I have been completely professional (though more of a friend than an authority figure) and would never, ever do anything with this boy outside of school.... but I have thought about it.

I also am reasonably sure that he's attracted to me, which makes it worse (though I guess most 16 year old boys are attracted to anything that moves, eh). I maintain my distance from him, but I want often so much just to be flirty. And it sucks. Because I feel like I'm really, really gross and socially wrong to be feeling this way, but that doesn't actually change my desires. 

I don't know what I'm looking for. I guess any advice or comments are relevant. I'm glad this semester is coming to an end; I won't be placed with him next semester and can get him out of my mind.

We actually met when he answered my very strange craigslist ad asking for someone to spend Christmas with. I was lonely and afraid of being alone and in desperation and slight inebriation, I posted it. I actually got a LOT of replies, but he stood out. We met for coffee and it was instantly more.

 I read through every single comment and thought about things long and hard. Then, yesterday morning, while the girls were playing outside, I just sort if broke down to my husband about the whole thing. I told him how the feelings I have about her and my frustrations with her and how I feel so fucking guilty about it all.  He told me that I was being too hard on myself and that he had never noticed me treating her differently that my youngest. And reading all your comments made me realize that maybe I am being too hard on myself. All the stories of mothers who flat out told their children they weren't loved, or wouldn't give hugs and kisses or were abusive. I have never put her down, I have never called her names, and I tell her I love her multiple times a day. I read them stories at night and tuck them both in with hugs and kisses. 

 I guess the guilt stems from the feelings I have, feelings that haven't manifested, thank goodness. Thanks to all your comments, I can turn this all around before any damage is done. 

So yesterday, after bawling to my husband, we all went as a family to get flowers to plant, then when we got home, the girls and I planted a flower bed underneath their bedroom window. It was a good Mothers Day, after all.

And not a moment too soon.  See, everyone has cockroaches, this is Brazil.  But if you let things get bad enough, you get scorpions, and that's no day in the magic kingdom.

So I didn't have anyplace to store food for two months, everything was in boxes in other rooms while the contractors delayed getting my kitchen cabinets to me.  Finally, they were installed.  

When I put the food in the cabinets, I would literally have a half dozen cockroaches running around as soon as I opened the box.  It got so I would open the lid, spray it with insecticide, and close it, wait a little while, and open it again, toss out any container that wasn't sealed, and wash the rest with soap and water.

I think that gets it clean.  If not, what's a little parathion between friends?

Finally, we've got our kitchen, and for the past month, I've occasionally noticed a cockroach running around inside the microwave door.  Well, since we're a clean household now, it's only a matter of killing just that one last one, and we're cockroach-free!

So I tapped on the glass and shined a light in there to make him run into the body of the door, then I put the poison into where I thought he came in and I gave it a spray.  Fucker would be dead in a couple hours, no worries.

I come back an hour later, and this fucking dead cockroach is right there behind the glass to the microwave.  No way to get him out.  It's like he knew he was dying and wanted to make himself as visible as possible to...what, warn others?  They specifically make those things hard to take apart.  So I turned the microwave upside down and shook it to get him to fall just barely in behind a piece of plastic, and there he sits.

If my wife sees it, she's going to make me buy a new microwave.  I like this microwave.

Now you have to realize, sophomores were only allowed to go to prom if a junior or senior asked them, so I was earning major coolness points by being a guy asked by an older girl.  Anyways, I really wanted to go with LR, but seeing as my family was poor as shit I couldn't afford a tux, much less the $70 or so that it costed just to go to prom.  Note: I had tried to get a job at literally every store in town, but it was a small town and all the entry level jobs weren't hiring, the next towns were all at least 20 miles away,and this was 2009 so the economy was already tanked.  So me and LR and a couple other friends devised a plan to get me a tux(we figured the $70 would just turn up eventually).   We decide to steal the garments for the tux piece by piece.  Realizing that we were already stealing, I decided I wanted a nice tux, so we went to Macy's once or twice a week after school.  Being the analytical mind that I am I thought through every security measure that I could think of in department stores.  First, I went to someone I knew who worked at a clothing store and asked them to steal me a security tag remover in exchange for alcohol(I had connections).  Second, I made sure everyone in our stealing group knew that if any of us were caught the rest would deny all and any knowledge of the thefts.  Anyway, we would go into the Macy's, shop around for a few minutes grabbing about 7 clothing items, the 3rd or 4th item always being the one that was wanted, and then go to the dressing room, remove the security tag, and put it on under the clothes we walked in with.  The first time, we all went with just for me to get my suit coat, retail price $350.  the next few times, the others started taking things for themselves as well and when I had acquired all of my tux pieces(shoes, belt, vest, coat, pants, even nice socks) the total was almost $1000.  I started saving the pricetags, but then realized I did not want to be caught with them if my parents ever decided to snoop.  Anyway,  we all got such a rush out of it, and we had gotten all the things for my tux we realized that I still needed that $70.  Well around where we live, there are stores that buy gently used name brand clothing from you, and I decided it would be a brilliant idea to sell brand new just stolen clothing to them.  Note:  we lived about 60 miles from a metro area of 3 million people and yes we drove there a couple times a week.  Anyways, prom was still a month away so we started stealing for ourselves, as well as stuff we could sell to these stores. There were about 4 different Macys', and 4 of these used clothing stores that we decided to frequent.  And after realizing that the used clothing store paid more for other brands, we hit up Hollister, American Eagle, Abercrombie, etc. We only ever had one close call, at a Macy's after we got so bold as to bring another store's bag in and fill it with clothes and try to walk out, but a secret shopper(he was pretty obvious) was following us.  I never felt like I was doing anything really wrong, I got kind of a high from doing it and it didn't feel that wrong stealing from a huge company.  Also I think it made us feel significant, as if what we did actually mattered even though it was in a bad way.  Cut to six months later and I estimate I stole 7-10k in clothes MYSELF, not including my friends.  And had made over 1k in clothes selling.  We would always rotate stores so we never went to the same one more than a couple times a month.  I stopped doing it a lot when other kids at school found out and would say things about it, I didn't want to be known as a thief, but still did it once in a while by myself until I finally moved out, turned 18 and got a job.  Feels good to admit that to people now, even if (hopefully) none of them know me.
EDIT: To steal the shoes, we would buy a cheap 1 or 2 dollar pair from the thrift store, and then go to the dept store and switch them out and walk out wearing the new shoes.

I have never touched harmed or abused any child. Nor do I ever plan on doing so. I believe full adamantly that child pornography/exploitation is a terrible terrible crime.

**history:**
I guess I started getting off to what is known as lolicon(drawings) and moved up and down from child models. I've told myself on numerous occasions that I would never do it again, but find myself coming back a month later or so.  I Used to even dabbled in finding actual child pornography on the web but have stopped because I fear the legal repercussions(what the fuck is wrong with me, i fear the legal repercussions of getting caught worse than the moral repercussions). But I haven't sought out actual CP in a good year or so, so hopefully I never will again (small steps).

**Depression:**
The biggest part that sits on my heart is the fact that I can literally tell nobody. While I could possibly tell my parents and siblings it would make the rest of my life incredibly awkward and terrible. 

I love children! I know this may seem weird but I think they are amazing in their own respect, but... Obviously I should never have them or be too close to them. 

I live in fear of my own terrible desires. Maybe one day I can get a chemical castration.

This happened for the next 3 years. I can't remember much obviously but I remember a few things...

This friend had a 14 year old son (let's call him Dan) who used to make me touch his penis. He used to play with mine then make me touch his own (I was unknowingly giving him hand jobs). Sometimes he used to put it on my face or force me to lick it. TBH I didn't find it that odd at the time and obeyed him - this continued for 3 years. Regardless, I still liked him because he used to let me play with his Nintendo afterwards.

The wrongness of this only occurred to me when I was about 13 when I met him at a party. The memories came back vividly. I didn't mention anything to him but I kept staring at him thinking WTF!

Within the first 12 hours or so of taking my last shower, I noticed a fairly strong and distinct B.O. smell coming from my armpits--the typical pungent, fried onion like smell. But that's easy to fix with simple deodorant. This would reoccur basically whenever my deodorant wore off. 

Amazingly, after the first week or so, the B.O. didn't come back. At first I assumed it was because I got used to the smell, but my girlfriend confirmed that I smelled fine. And I made extra sure by having her stick her nose right up arm pits, my balls, taint, my ass, everywhere. But still, no bad smells. 

That's not to say I don't smell like anything, there are definitely smells coming from my body. My crotch area especially develops this very distinct ""crotchy"" smell which is difficult to describe. It's a very male smell, if that means anything. But it's not so strong that you can smell it unless you're face is right in my crotch or you rub my balls then smell your fingers. And for what it's worth, my girlfriend likes the smell. She cups my balls when we spoon at night and can sometimes faintly smell my balls on her fingers during the day. She enjoys it.

But despite not showering I still follow some basic hygiene. I occasionally (once a month or so) take a wet face cloth and give my crotch area a quick wipe down, no soap or anything. This is mostly because after a while the smell does become a bit stronger and I can start to faintly smell my own crotch if I have to bend over to pick something up. Again, it's not really an unpleasant smell, but I do it because I don't want others to know that I don't shower because of the obvious social stigma against it. I'll also give my ass crack a quick wipe while I'm at it because that's where shit comes out of and you'll want to clear out any left over debris that builds up periodically. 

That's all the washing I do. Occasionally, on very hot days, I put on a bit of deodorant, but just a small amount and only to prevent sweating and soaking the arm pits of my t-shirts. I always ask my girlfriend to double check if I smell every time before we go out anywhere... she sticks her nose everywhere and every time no bad smells. No one else thinks I smell either (I've indirectly asked several people without saying I don't shower). 

My totally un-researched theory is that whatever bacteria builds back up when you initially wash it all away in the shower is the bacteria that smells like like bad B.O. I think the subsequent bacteria that builds up over the course of several days neutralizes the smell and that's when your skin is balanced and not dried out, etc. 

So there you have it. In my experience and opinion, showering is a totally unnecessary indulgence at best. Not only did it clear my skin up, it gave me a new crotchy odor that girls like. Also, it made me realize that back before soap and daily showering, people probably smelled fine, despite the popular belief that everyone stunk. It also made me realize that that person you sometimes run across who stinks like horrible B.O. probably just took a shower and forgot deodorant. 

TLDR: I have eczema that got bad in the shower, so I stopped taking showers. I smelled bad at first but after a week it went away. My crotch smells crotchy though, but not strong enough that you can smell it from normal talking distance. It's not a bad smell, just a crotchy smell. My girlfriend likes the smell of my crotch on her fingers in the morning too so it's win/win. No one else knows.

Edit: I should add a few things. I'm thin and keep my hair extremely short. I also don't have a ton of body hair. These factors might influence my outcome to a certain degree.

Edit/Update: Thanks for all the positive feedback everyone. The no shower movement is finally taking shape. As for my detractors, you need to realize that I'm still cleaning up. I was my hands and face every morning like anyone else and also my crotch and ass on a somewhat regular basis, whether it's wiping it down dry with a paper towel or full on scrubbing with a wet wash cloth, the dirt and sweat isn't staying on my body. I just don't need hundreds of gallons of water per month just to stay clean, that's all. 

So if you think I'm walking around smelling, you're dreaming. I'm clean, my clothes are clean, my head is clean. I don't smell, I promise you. I have an attractive girlfriend and a good job. Trust me, if I smelled I'd know by now.

Also, the point I'm making here is not that you won't smell after taking your last shower. You will smell very very bad for the first 1-2 weeks, that's for certain. What I am saying is that my experience shows that once you pass that 1-2 week period (which may be longer for others), the bad odors go away. If you don't believe me, you'll just have to try it out for yourselves. But remember, this all assumes that you're maintaining basic hygiene such as wiping your ass, brushing your teeth and wearing clean clothes. If you're covered in shit and piss all the time of course you're going to smell, shower or not.

Final Update: Thank you for all the kind words and support. Overwhelmingly, the reaction to this post has been positive. And this was all in spite of the onslaught of negative comments coming from the same sorts of people who think European girls are dirty because they don't shave their armpits or shower every day. It's just an outdated view of hygiene propagated by grandmothers and the soap industry. Also, I hope people realize that people with certain physical disabilities are washing up in similar ways to me and not getting in and out of a bathtub every day--and they aren't filthy either.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1341972468.0,,,True,t3_w8r1z,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w8r1z/i_havent_showered_in_approx_15_years_i_dont_smell/,

1346600728.0,198,self.confession,z8ecw,When I was in highschool I used to anonymously send naked pictures of myself to boys I liked (and some teachers too),337,139,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/z8ecw/when_i_was_in_highschool_i_used_to_anonymously/,"I just have to say this somewhere. Recently I had to visit home and I ended up hanging out with several people I hadn't seen since graduating highschool. After a few drinks one of the guys asked if we remembered the ""child porn incident"" from back during our junior year. Of course we all remembered. The guy then said ""Man I wish we would have found out who that was. She had great tits!"". That's when my ""friend"" (I never really liked this girl and frankly I don't know how she got invited to this reunion of ours) suddenly declared that it had been her.

Everyone believed her. Boy did that make me angry! I didn't say anything out of embarrassment but obviously I knew she hadn't sent those pictures. Because I was the one who did.

See during my freshman year I was sort of starved for attention. Without going into too much detail I'll just say that I was a pretty typical adolescent girl: I didn't think I was pretty enough, I got crushes on boys all the time, that sort of thing. I was also sort of bratty to be honest and self-centered. And one day, for some reason, I decided to take some naked pictures of myself.

To my surprise I was actually pleased with how they turned out. I looked pretty damned sexy, I thought, but I was smart enough to know I could get into trouble if I posted them online. Instead, and I'll never know how this idea popped into my head, I ended up printing six copies of my favorite (one that showed me from the neck to my thighs).

The next day at school I slipped the pictures into the lockers of six different guys I sort of had crushes on. I don't know what I expected would happen but it gave me this wild thrill to imagine them seeing my naked body. I never heard anything about that batch but just imagining those boy's reactions to the pictures made me want to do it again.

So I did but this time I mailed the pictures. I actually rode my bike across town and used a public mailbox because I was afraid they'd be traced back to me. The other difference was that I included three separate pictures this time in each envelope and expanded my list of recipients to eight boys and two male teachers. 

I did this once in a while up until my junior year. Sometimes I would write little messages on my body with lipstick, like ""Go Ravens!"" (not our real HS team but you get the idea) or flirty things like ""Thinking of you!"" on pictures of me touching myself. 

Eventually I sent pictures to the wrong person: a boy whose mother opened up his mail for him. She made a huge deal about it and I'll never forget when an ""emergency assembly"" was called and there were sheriff deputies in the gym alongside some very serious-looking people. Our whole school was lectured about child pornography and how whoever was sending out these pictures was committing a serious felony. We were all urged to come forward if we had any information about them. 

Apparently the pictures had been reported before but nothing had been done about them until this one particular mother made a huge stink. At least that's what I heard-- there were so many rumors surrounding this ""controversy""! Like, who was the girl in the pictures? Was it just some prank by a bored loser like so-and-so? It was probably that girl who dropped out earlier in the year. No, it's wasn't even real, it was just a bunch of adults trying to scare everyone into not trading naked pictures online. On and on the rumors went..

And honestly?? I enjoyed it. Sure I was anxious as heck at first that I'd be discovered somehow but I admit that I really liked the ""attention"" I was receiving. Hearing guys who I knew had actually seen the pictures brag about it was a huge turn-on. Heck, hearing guys lie and say they'd received pictures was also a turn-on. Even hearing girls say that the pictures ""had to be fake"" because the girl in them was obviously a professional model was a turn-on. I was the focus of a huge scandal and no one knew! 

Now all these years later this bitch claims that she was the one in the pictures. Yeah right. She was barely an A-cup before getting pregnant right after graduation.

My sister was a drug addict, prostitution, in &amp; out of prison. You name it. My brother was always horrible to me &amp; still is to this day.

My mam would call my step mother &amp; saying things like ""you're trying to take my daughter away from me"" 

I hated my parents. They would tell me almost everyday how much of a mess I made of their lives. 

When I was about 10 one of my mam's ""friends"" touched me, I told my parents &amp; they called me a lying bitch.

My sister had a child &amp; that kinda snapped her out of the drugs, my parents own him now though. When my nephew came around that's when my parents stopped spending everything in the pub. I'm glad they stopped but it made me realize even more how much they hated me.

I dropped out of school when I was 16. Worst decision of my life. I went back 2 years later to do my exams, of course I failed everything. I can't even get a job because of my low grades.

Now at 18 my parents still hate me. I stayed with a friend for two weeks &amp; they didn't even notice I was gone.

The only person in my whole family who's nice to me is my dog...

My life is going nowhere &amp; it's all my fault. 
I've attempted suicide twice, one when I was 14 &amp; again at 16. Even today my mam says ""ha you can't even kill yourself right"" it's so horrible having to hear things like that from your own parents almost everyday.

I had an uncle who had the same issue, went through SRS and later committed suicide. When I was a teenager, my mother caught me wearing one of her bras. She asked me what did she do wrong. She used that secret against me multiple times since then when she wanted to hurt me or humiliate me. 

I've had a few relationships with women over the years (I'm not attracted to boys). But I've either sabotaged the relationship, or went in knowing that it would most likely not work out. Three affairs with married women. And the women I've been with, have felt there was something I was holding back. That I would only share so much. I couldn't. The one time I shared my secret with someone I thought I loved was so humiliating that I don't dare repeat it. 

I don't crossdress. I'm too afraid of being humiliated again. I don't have the courage to come out now, not to mention I'm too old. I'm in poor health now.

I slept with my brothers first g/f and future wife. We were both 16 at the time and my brother was 14. They weren't having sex, and she didn't know how to make it so they would and i sorta took advantage of it by telling her I could help. We had sex constantly, but, I never felt any love with her, and she sadly did love me. I felt bad, but, she was so damn hot and I was horny and lonely. When they finally started having sex, she lied and said she was a virgin to him and he believed it. She never really loved him but was too afraid to break his heart because she was very weak willed and shy. She grew up very socially awkward, had few friends and was just odd. After we graduated HS we both stayed at home and went to a Community College. her grades were terrible and she couldn't afford a university. I as well. Things got worse when my brother after graduating went off to join the army. He told me before he shipped out, he wanted to marry her before he left. 

I didn't have anything to say, but, good luck. I wish I could have told him how she really felt. That night I got the worst news of my life when she told me she was pregnant. I asked her if it was ours or his, and she didn't know. I told her, she had to get an abortion. Im then told her we had to stop having sex, and just sorta end the relation between us. She cried, because she to my horror loved me. I managed to guilt trip her into getting the abortion by saying ""if you really love me you'll do it and then we'll see what happens"", despite her wanting to have the child. I knew she would be devastated but kept on pushing her. A couple days later she got the abortion, and that was the end of that. I felt it was probably a good time to fully tell her how i felt, and so I told her off and told her I never loved her and didn't want to keep on with the relation. It killed her inside, and all she said was ""I hate you"" in such a cold voice. She accepted his proposal, and they've been married ever since. She doesn't love him nor herself and you can tell she doesn't because she's lost her youthful charm, now she's bitter and depressed. She' lies and says she's just depressed and as such their relation suffers. they constantly fight, and my brother comes to me and tells me how he doesn't understand why she's so depressed. I ruined her life because I kept on sleeping with her instead of laying down the law and ending it before things got out of hand. 

Nobody knows about this, and if they did find out I'd be no longer welcome with the family. My brother would probably kill me if he knew I was sleeping with his g/f and fiance and got her pregnant and forced her to have an abortion. It's been a few years, I'm nearing 30 and to be married in October. I regret every moment of it. She's been suicidal several times now, and has a child she doesn't care for, a husband she doesn't love and a life she didn't want. I do my best to avoid her, and likewise with her.

How did my brother or anyone never find out? Simple my brother was an idiot and we hid the relation. My brother knew we were friends, but, never figured out we were more then friends. We had a few close calls, but, we never really did anything but have sex. Sometimes we'd go out on dates, but, those were few and far between.

as i said in my last post jake and i were supposed to have a ""bro night"" of just goofing off and stuff. when i met him at the restaurant where we were going to have dinner, jake was acting really awkward. there was SO much tension between the two of us. i was a mess on the inside, thinking i had ruined our friendship. towards the end of the dinner we began talking about graduation (only 36 days left!) and what comes after...it was really depressing, but i attributed it the fact that he pretty much told me that he doesn't know what his sexuality is just a few hours previously, so it has been an intense day for both of us. 

after dinner, we went to the movies and saw Evil Dead..this is where things get interesting i guess you can say. during one part of the movie there was an intense jump scene (there are lots in this movie) and everyone in the theater jumped, but jake grabbed my hand and held on for the rest of the movie (which was a good 30-45 minutes). after the credits started to roll he said he wanted to wait to see if there was an after-the-credits scene. i waited with him and everyone else left the theater...then it was just me and him, with him still holding my hand. 

and then he just started bawling. i don't know what it was or if it was just combined stress from the day, but he was crying so hard and just held on to me. i couldnt get a word out of him. after about 20 minutes and the cleaning people coming in to clean around us, i finally got him to leave with me and i drove him to his apartment. he apologized for what happened, then invited me inside. i declined at first, but then he persisted. so i went in with him.

All we did was talk some more. About everything and anything we could think of. I wanted to ask him why he started crying at the movies but it definitely wasn't the time. I told him that I was going to have to leave as i have work early in the morning, and he seemed to get angry--but not at me. idk how to explain it, but i know Jake when he gets mad. 

he left me in the living room to go take a shower and do laundry, so i just sat by myself and tried not to feel awkward, but i did...for the first time since we had ever been friends, i felt out of place. NOT GOOD. about 25 minutes later he came back in, told me he was sorry about everything and then he gave me a letter with my name on it. i guess it's a letter, i haven't opened it yet

he took a melatonin and told me not to open the envelope until i was away from him. he sat down beside me, laid his head on my shoulder, and told me that he doesn't want anything to happen to us. 

i didnt say anything for awhile. i finally decided to leave, jake walked me to the door and again asked me for a goodnight kiss... but i politely told him no, that we shouldn't, etc. he took hold of my hand and gave me a quick peck on the cheek as he had done before, told me sweet dreams, then went to bed. 

i feel like I've fucked up, but now that shit's out in the open i feel better. i still need to read the letter he gave me, because jake and i used to write letters to one another over the summer between freshman/sophomore year just for fun. im too scared to read it and i just...need time to absorb everything.

Their young, tight sixteen year old bodies, the prime of adolescence. It really was a goldmine for a similar aged version of myself. I saw what I wanted to see every single day. I got that holy grail I'd always asked for, and I'd walk past them, with a secret only I knew.

I've been out of school for a few years now, and I still have them. I know I should delete them, but I've just never brought myself to. I still look at them, every once in a full moon, usually because I forget I even have them and remember randomly. I know now, I've technically got child pornography in my possession, but it's much more than that. They are my peers, who I fawned over at the same age as them, and who are the same age as me now too. That moment is crystallized now, a symbol of my not so innocent youth, and their perfect bodies, their physical peak which will never be attained again, mine to keep, preserved forever. 

I know it's wrong, and beyond fucked up, but those girls don't exist anymore. I'm not trying to justify, what I've done by keeping these photos is wrong. Flat out. But those girls are women now. Their innocence has died too. At least I have a reminder of it. I don't even have them for any deviant purpose. I've never once masturbated over them. Even when I was first given them. It was never about that, but something much more intimate and personal, and equally sick and twisted. I keep them as a reminder, of who I am, and who these girls were to me. Just pictures to look at.

One student looks just like James McAvoy, who I've been attracted to since he came on the scene! The resemblance is uncanny. One time I almost called him James.

",319,121,307,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/16pfu5/i_got_a_girl_pregnant_broke_up_with_her_and_then/,"A few months ago I started to casually see this girl, let's call her Jessica. Now I was pretty up front with her from the beginning about how I was looking for anything serious and she seemed fine with that. Our ""relationship"" consisted of her coming over after work a couple of times a week and us fucking.  

A few weeks ago I sent her a text on my way home asking if she'd like to hang out. When she got there Jessica told me she was around 5 weeks pregnant and assured me that I was the only one who could have been the father. My entire future flashed before my eyes, I'd have to tell my parents I'd knocked up a girl I barely knew, child support payments, responsibility, and a girl who I'd only wanted as a FWB was now going to be a major part of the rest of my life. 

I asked her what she wanted to do, praying that she'd say abortion and this would all be over but much to my dismay she said she wasn't sure. She said that maybe it was a sign, that we should have it and raise it together. We sat there in silence for what felt like hours till she finally asked what I was thinking. At first I danced around it, trying to sugarcoat what I was going to say, but finally I blurted out that I didn't want to be a dad or be with her. She started to cry, got angry, and stormed out saying that if I didn't want to raise it that was fine and that she'd do it on her own. 

I didn't sleep that night. I just kept thinking about how even though I eventually wanted kids I didn't want to do it like this and especially not with her. Even if she absolved me of all responsibility I didn't think I could live knowing my kid was out there. I had to do something. So I went over to her apartment the next day, sat her down, and told her 1 of 2 things was going to happen.

1. She was going to have an abortion which I would not only pay for but write her a check for $3,000 to help her get on her feet.

2. She could have the baby but I would find the most expensive lawyer I could and sue for full custody which I would undoubtedly get considering she was unemployed, living on her friends sofa, and had a history of drug addiction and mental illness (she went to rehab when she was 17 for anorexia and pain killers). While I was a college graduate from a wealthy family who owned his own home and made over 100k per year. I went on to tell her that once I had gotten full custody I'd make sure she'd never see the kid again. 

She started to cry and I walked out. I felt bad but honestly it was for the best. She couldn't raise a kid on her own and I didn't want it, if the kid had been born he or she would have had a terrible life. She called me the next day and I made an appointment, and drove her to the clinic. After I got her home and into bed I wrote her the check and left. That was 6 months ago and I haven't seen her since. Last I heard she had gotten a job bar tending and was thinking about going back to school.

I wrote them a message, explaining the situation in a polite manner. All I simply asked was to require her to show them a recent STD test (within a few weeks). I did not say she was some diseased whore or anything like that. I was cordial and straightforward.

Their response was less than I expected. I was accused of trying to start drama and that I was out of line for doing what I did. However, they did say they would ""look into it"". I doubt they will. I hope they enjoy genital herpes.

1374442623.0,191,self.confession,1irs46,I secretly support people's decisions to commit suicide.,255,64,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1irs46/i_secretly_support_peoples_decisions_to_commit/,"Let me preface this by saying that I would never, ever let a suicidal person know I feel this way. And yes, I have lost two people to suicide: my dad used a shotgun on himself and my uncle hung himself. These were both three years ago.

I hate it when people try to guilt the suicidal into staying alive by telling them how much their loved ones will be hurt. These same people also tend to call the suicidal selfish, which I also hate. Yes, loved ones will be hurt, and perhaps it is selfish, but no more selfish than loved ones wanting to keep a suicidal person alive just because other people will be negatively affected, never mind that it just prolongs the suicidal person's suffering.

Sure, the suicidal person who decides not to commit suicide, or fails at the attempt, may eventually find fulfilment in life, but then again, maybe that person won't. Either way, it doesn't matter to me; I am a firm believer in autonomy. In my opinion, every person ought to be able to do with him- or herself whatever s/he wishes.

My father suffered from depression his entire life, which was only exacerbated when he joined the army. Once he left, he wasn't the same, I guess. He'd been suicidal before, but never did anything because the family kept guilting him out of it. Still, no matter how many medications he tried and therapy sessions he attended, he wasn't happy. Killing himself was the only way he felt he could find peace and comfort. At first, I felt the same way my family felt about his death: devastated. But then, my dad was devastated his entire life, wasn't he? 

As for my uncle, he hung himself when he found out my aunt wanted a divorce and planned to take the kids. The consensus is that it was an impulsive decision on his part, and while I disagree with that aspect of it, I still believe it is his right to do with his body whatever he wishes. And hell, nobody knows exactly what he was thinking and feeling at that moment. All I know is that he was in so much agony he felt that the only way out of it was through death.

Nor can I understand exactly what any other suicidal person is going through in his or her head. No matter the situation, though, if things are that horrible that the person feels like the only answer is through death, then perhaps that might be the best thing for that person. Maybe not. I don't know. Either way, it isn't my decision--or anyone else's, for that matter--to decide.

I'm not saying my logic is infallible, and I understand why people will think this is reprehensible. It's their choice, though, even if other people disagree with it, and even if it turns out not to be the best choice. Still, sometimes I really think it might be. Like for my dad.

I am on my phone and have never used bacon reader before.
I have worked for this company for 12 years and I loved my job. I worked with people with developmental disabilities and I adore all of them. For the most part my company was good to me but paid poorly. Raises became a thing of the past but a few promotions and a husband working more than full time made raising 4 Beautiful children doable. About 3 years ago my husband almost died from 3 months of pneumonia which resulted in an empiema that collapsed his lung. Surgery was successful but we didnt have insurance. We also began to have other huge financial blows during the collapse of the housing market. Eventually we sought financial counselling and were advised to file for bankruptcy. Unfortunately we hired a bad lawyer who took our money and did nothing. In the end we lost out home and had 2 weeks to find a place to rent. The only place available was a way over priced slum that was infested with roaches and had no heat or air. We had no choice but to take it. Shortly after my husbands hours were cut and we were both garnished. We ended up evicted with a week to move. On top of losing two homes we lost our cars. We managed to finally get some assistance with food but it lasted for two weeks. Two weeks we barely had food. We managed to find a better place to live in a small trailer park but moving expenses were very expensive and honestly impossible for us. 
My husband was out of work. I had no options and I had to take care of my kids. This is where the felony comes in.
I was responsible for the funds for a group of the people we supported. Though the company was responsible for auditing these funds it rarely ever happened. I had full access to this money and it was never used fully. We were responsible to keep the funds under a certain amount and that was difficult to do. I made a decision I never would have made under normal circumstances to borrow some of it to feed my family. At first it was amounts I would easily pay back within the month. But then more financial blows occurred when the assistance we were approved for to cover out 2nd months rent didnt come through and we spent our money on other bills and werent prepared for rent on top of it. We were short $250 and nobody was able to help. I had reluctantly borrowed money to cover it from the clients to cover rent and our needs until I got paid. I tried to cash out vacation time to pay it back but it wasnt approved until 2 weeks later and only got half of it. We were behind on everything and were paying back people we borrowed from every week and barely had money for anything. We needed food and gas was crazy. Our broken down car Finally broke beyond our ability to afford the fix. I had to pay for rides to work and back and to town once or twice a week to get what we needed to live. My check wasnt covering the bills and the added expenses. I ended up borrowing to pay rent again and exhausted the funds. Each paycheck I paid back what I could and covered their weekly expenses but wasnt prepared for the extra money their caregivers started asking for. I tried to put them off while I requested extra funds from their accounts. One caregiver became upset and went to my boss. I guess this sparked suspicion and they decided to investigate. In the end they found that over $2000 was unaccounted for. More in comments.

A few weeks ago, I was crashing at Tina's place for the night after a really late meeting for one of my college's clubs, and one of the clubs other members, Rob, decided he wanted to come with us back to Tina's dorm. Tina and I agreed that it would be fine, even though we both agreed that Rob was a bit creepy, if not a complete psychopath.

While we were at Tinas place, Rob suggested we play truth or dare, and me and Tina sort of rolled our eyes because he had been making pervy jokes all day, talking about a ""six week dry spell"" or some bullshit. We went with it, just to make him shut his damn mouth.

Tina poured us all some soda, but my drink was in a different glass than Rob's and Tina's. It didn't seem like much at the time, but now, I'm not so sure. 

I got dared to play strip poker. 

I rolled with it.

My friend knew how to count cards apparently (she did not tell me this at the time), and kept dealing me the worst hands ever.

I lost. Miserably.

I felt really uncomfortable, not only because I was naked in front of two people that I had only known since mid-August, but also because I was at the time recovering from a very invasive surgery on my sexual organs, due to the fact that they were incredibly underdeveloped, and felt very vulnerable, but I was scared to say anything because these guys were the only people in town that I felt really cared about me, and weren't annoyed by me. 

Anyways, I lost, Rob got hands-y.

I went with it, again because I was scared, both of loosing them as friends, and of Rob, because the dude does not exactly have all his screws in.

Tina watched. She ""enjoyed"" herself. She offered to get a camera, all the while I'm mentally shutting down. I couldn't really keep up with what was happening, it just blurred. I periodically would mentally catch up with what was being done to me, and attempt to wriggle out of his grasp, or try to get the game back onto more wholesome tracks, but every time I said something that Rob didn't like, tried to derail whatever track he was on, he'd just do something to make my brain shut off again.

After a while, Rob told me he wanted me to come back to his place. I kept asking the girl what I should do, in very much a ""Jesus Christ get me the fuck out of this"" tone of voice, but she just told me to go with him.

I agreed, partially because I naively thought, ""Okay, we'll just make out, then he'll leave me alone, please god let him leave me alone,"" and partially because the idea of staying in the same room as a girl that had just jilled it to me getting molested made me feel ill.

As we were leaving Tina's apartment, Rob turned back, gave Tina a high five, and I heard him mutter ""You fucking rock, thanks!"" to her.

The entire walk back to his place, every other sentence out of my mouth was, ""We aren't going to have sex. I don't want to have sex. We aren't going to have sex."" He kept telling me he wouldn't.

We went to his place, he got me naked, I just did the whole dead fish thing where I just laid there and let him do his thing. It all blurred together, One minute he was doing one thing, the next he decided he was going to break the no sex rule.

The bastard wasn't even wearing a condom.

I started crying, he tried to make it feel good.

I felt myself getting torn apart, he told me I was doing fine.

He got off three times, I got all bloodied up and bruised up.

He made me suck him off after he fucked me. I can still taste the blood.

I got sick the next morning. He held my hair back, rubbed my back, tried to play this whole thing off like it was nothing. He told me I did good, I'm a right natural at this, that we should do it again some time.

Tina came and picked me up because Rob called her, told her I was sick, and needed to go home.

I went home and collapsed into bed. I felt exhausted. I woke up two hours later, sore as hell. I realized that I could smell Rob on me, and could still taste him in my mouth. I threw up all over my bed, ran to the shower, and scrubbed for so long my skin started to bleed. 

The pants I had worn on the ride back to my dorm were ruined. Rob had decided to keep my underwear, so I ended up bleeding all over my clothing. And it wasn't a normal amount of blood that would be expected for the typical virginity loss. I literally had rivers of blood running down my legs. It was like a nightmare. I had to get a maxipad to save some of my clothing.

The next day, I spoke to Tina about the night. I asked her if anything was in the drink, she told me no. I told her what happened with Rob, she sneered but told me that she was ""here for me if I needed to talk.""

I haven't seen Tina or Rob for the past few weeks, granted I haven't really left my dorm room. I would actually be thrilled if I never saw them again.

I haven't gone a day without vomiting or getting diarrhea. I've been picking my skin and my hair has been falling out. I can't sleep, but when I do, I have these horrific nightmares. I'm on fire or drowning, or I'm back with Rob and he is fucking me in front of the entire campus, and I always wake up sobbing. I've been dropping weight like crazy, and I can't go out in public without being scared. I haven't stopped bleeding, part of me thinks I might have torn something from my surgery.

I'm not a sexual being. I didn't want to have sex yet. Let alone with him. It seems ridiculous, but after all the shit I've gone through to have normal sexual organs, and believe me, it's been a lot, I wanted my first to be someone I thought of as a future husband. Not some psychopath from my Humans vs Zombies club. Until that night, I hadn't even been kissed. I've never gone out on a date. Hell, I haven't really ever even masturbated. 

I don't know what to do now. I feel like I'm loosing my mind, and my health is suffering because of it.

I don't like pretending to be anything I'm not, yet somehow I've found myself working for one of the biggest corporations in America. I work on one of the top floors of one of the tallest buildings in a big city.  Every morning I wake up, roll out of bed, put on my suit and tie and shave.  God do I hate shaving.   Then I take the bus to work, looking out the window and imagining what would happen if I just took half a hit of acid one day and went in.  Would anyone notice?  Would I get fired?  Would that be such a bad thing?

I sit in an office and thank people for putting work on my desk.  I thank them for giving me ""constructive criticism.""   I thank them for taking time out of their busy days to acknowledge me with conversation. No one suspects a thing.  

I stare out the window wondering why people work their whole lives to get bigger offices.  I can assure you that they are still offices.

I take the bus home wondering why I haven't just stopped showing up.  The reality is that this is my first big job, I was promised lavish perks with a laid back atmosphere and a stress free environment.  I was maliciously lied to.  I spent every dime I had to move for this job.  Now I just sit on the bus thinking of how nice it would be to skip work and go hiking.  The greatest part of my day are the 3 free hours after a 10 hour work day where I can listen to music while I cook.  Those hours are the only tie I have to my past and the only thing keeping me sane.

I am the business hippie.  I can't be the only one.  Stop and look around at your office, maybe its full of business hippies.

I, a 12 year old female, create a male character and start chatting up girls online for fun. I'll just clarify here that I'm a straight female. I think. I'm confused. Anyways..

It continued for a solid 4 years. I had three long internet relationships with females in that time, using fake photos and elaborate stories to cover myself. I'd talk to these girls for hours on end, every evening. And grew to really care for them. 

At first, I had two mind frames. Me, and then the person I was pretending to be. I'd get into character when I signed into MSN. Then when I left, I'd still be normal me.

But then.. I started thinking like who I was pretending to be all the time. Thinking about fucking girls, how hot chicks are, making comments in my  head that would be exclusive to males (dick stuff, pretty much)

I stopped when I was 16 and got a more social life, but really, I still think like a guy most of the time. I feel like I'm incredibly confused, and cant hold a proper relationship because of it. I'm straight, but when I'm thinking like a male, I'll often think about how I want to fuck that girl, or how beautiful a girl is. I even find myself staring at boobs.

fuck, it feels good to let all that shit out.

edit: thanks everyone, sounds like I might need a professional haha. And to everyone who seems offended by me saying I think like a male, what I actually mean there is that I can't imagine *who I really am* dating or sleeping with a girl, but I'll often have fantasies and thoughts about *being a male* and dating or sleeping with a girl.

I'm considered one of the most eligible bachelors around.  Middle aged, athletic, intelligent, artistic and profession and considered very good looking -- but none of the ""respectable"" women who are after me interest me in the slightest.  I hear pitches about how they are looking for stable normal relationships and would be totally devoted and faithful, and it just turns me off.

My problem is that I can only have feelings for preverted, slutty women, and I don't mean those that like the occasional walk on the wild side, but those that are way out there.  The sluttier a woman is, the stronger I am attracted to her.  If she just has to have a steady diet of different cocks and pussies, I gonna fall hard for her.  My current semi girl friend has fucked over a hundred men, whored her self out regularly until she decided to stop for other reasons (safety).  When I do down on her, I nearly cum thinking about all the men who have fucked her, or kissing her thinking about all the men whose cum she has swallowed.  Yea, my romantic past is full of whores, strippers and porn actresses.

It not just the sluttiness.  When a girl tells me she is into animals, piss or whatever, or she was really a ""daddys girl"" growing up, I just want her.  When she has no limits and is ready to do anything.. wow.

So here is the thing.  It's not a sexual attraction I feel, it is romantic. I fall in love with these girls (I saw that cause mostly they are in their early 20s or so and I'm in my 40s)

I'll figure this out on my own.  Also - I'm using a throwaway because some people know my real account.

I've been live-in dating the same girl for 7 years now.  The last couple of years, things have been less than perfect in eden.  A year ago we made plans to go on a trip for our anniversary... between making the plans and the actual start day of the trip, I made up my mind that I'd end the relationship after the trip.

On the trip, we were in an accident.  I was un-hurt, and she was severely injured being unable to walk.  The accident immediately changed my mode of thinking - I went into ""man mode"" and tried to do everything I could to help.  I was there in the hospital for her surgeries, I carried her onto the plane when our ""vacation"" was over.  I've been every step of the way the ""perfect"" guy.  Every one of my friends, and her friends and our respective families keep telling me how PROUD they are of how much I've stepped up to help her.

For the first several months of this, my desire to leave left, and was replaced by nothing but concern for her health.  I went grocery shopping for her, did her laundry, cleaned the entire house, took care of our pets, bought her a laptop so she could still communicate with people online.   Honestly, my concern for her made our relationship feel whole again... for awhile.

It's now been 8 months since the accident.  She's still in pain sometimes, and virtually everything she talks about is related to her injuries.  She still cannot work.  I still pay for everything.  She can kinda walk around a bit, but is entirely useless around the house in terms of chores.  All she does is watch movies, and talk to her friends online.

I've returned to my old ways, of trying to come up with ways to leave her.  I love her deeply, but I am NOT in love with her.  We have no physical relationship anymore, nor have we (minus one occasion) for at least 2 years - due to non-interest - not the injuries.  We have no interesting conversations anymore, as her life revolves around her injuries.  

I want to leave, but I also cannot.  She has very little family to support her, and other than me, none of her friends make enough money to support her.

*edit to add* She spends about 4 hours a day in physical therapy now (which I'm paying for). She's working very hard to get better, but her doctor says it'll be up to a year before she can return to work. /edit

I've secretly begun to hate being around her, and I don't know what to do.

**FINAL COMMENTS** *Thanks everyone for allowing me to get this off my chest, giving my your honest opinions and thoughts.  It's been oddly therapeutic to spill my guts about this to total strangers, because all my friends and family have this hero complex about me now.  I don't feel like a hero, and I don't feel I've done anything especially brave or noble.  Just because I pulled her out of the wreck, and went to get help she feels I saved her life.  She's told everyone this.  She's forgotten the trip was my idea.  She's forgotten that she wanted to cancel the trip last minute, and she's forgotten that the day of the wreck everything we did was my plan. I feel entirely responsible for her condition so my helping is only to rid myself of that guilt, in preparation for what will be the end.  I do not know when it will end, but it will.  Thank you for allowing me to vent.  It helps more than you know.*",,False,,t5_2qo2a,True,,,True,t3_f9pnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/f9pnz/confession_i_have_lost_interest_in_my_gf_but/,

I had a feeling something was up. He cheated on me before when we cost started going out and I recognized the signs. I was right. It's been going on for months.I am sick to my stomach. It's not just that he's fucking her, which is bad enough. The stuff he's been telling her! All the private details of our lives! Every little argument or fight (while conveniently leaving out anything that might make him look bad.) And all my private health concerns I haven't even shared with anyone in my family except him and my parents. I feel completely violated, like I've been emotionally raped.

Makes me sick to even think of him. How can he come home and try to cuddle and tell me he loves me when he's telling her that I'm lazy, I'm bossy, I'm too negative, I've let myself go (ha! I'm 36, had two kids, recovering from major surgery and *still* in better shape than him!) If I'm such a dead weight around his neck why does he get all jealous when I talk to my male friends?

But you know what's really unforgivable? He hasn't just been cheating on me but also our kids. He's skipped almost every recital and game and meeting to be with her. Our eleven year old daughter just hit puberty and is going through some stuff. Normal girl stuff, but to her it feels terrifying and scary and gross and generally a real big deal. He's not only told that other bitch every detail about of daughter, he been openly mocking her, calling her crazy, stupid, hysterical, saying she inherited my ""bitch genes.""

He expects her to still fawn on him and be daddy's girl. Well, you know what? She's not so stupid she doesn't notice you pulling away and becoming distant. she's seen the broken promises. Of course she's resentful! What's worse, he actually took the kids with him once and then told them to lie to me about it! My daughter told me though , and that's what tipped me off.

I am getting all my ducks in a row. I've opened an account he doesn't know aboout and have started transfering funds. I'm talking to a lawyer tomorrow. The kids and I are going to visit my parents in their country next month (he can't come because he has to ""work""). Ideally I'll serve him with the papers while we're there and we'll just stay there. But i have to see what the lawyer says.

**Edit:**

I just want to clarify that I'm not moving the money to hide it or punish him. He's burning through his own money like there's no tomorrow and I don't want him to clear out our savings next. All my pay is going into my new account too for the same reason. I'm not going to hide it from the lawyers, but I need to make sure my kids and I have money for food and a place to live.

I will talk to my lawyer before taking the kids out of the country. My family is only just the other side of the border, an hour drive away, so he could still see them, and they like it better there. But I don't know what the legalities are yet.

**Edit 2** Oh, it gets better. Apparently the bitch is engaged. If her fiancé could see what she says about him he'd never talk to her again. I'm can't tell him though. I can't give her any grounds to allege stalking or harassment or anything that might reflect badly on me in the divorce.

On a Friday night if I don't feel like going home to the burbs I head to the apartment, hide my suit in the back of the closet and put on my west-coast liberal attitude and outfits-- think Woody Harrelson or Owen Wilson, or Hunter S. Thompson or Philip K. Dick, or Yann Martel, or  Chuck Palahniuk-- and go hit up the open mic night at poetry clubs, art show, etc.

I've read all of the latest hip books and keep tabs on the music industry to know what's hot and be able to ""talk about it""--to the extent of dropping names without knowing anything else, mostly-- and actually do have some interest in art so can talk circles around most people on that subject.   I also studied a bunch of esoteric useless languages just enough to be able to fake my way through speaking it with non-native speakers and throw out various quotes, quips, and poetry in those languages.

I have a whole drawerful of insipid, angsty poetry that I cribbed together from things I found on the Internet like Kerouac and song lyrics and whatever sounds fake-insightful, and wrote it all out longhand in a Moleskine notebook with pressed flowers and leaves and clippings from Mother Jones etc., pasted together to look like I'm some sort of artist. And of course, some ""tasteful"" nudes so that I can get whoever I end up chatting with on to the subject of sex and how most people are so prudish but it's just, like, natural, babe.

I am constantly getting arty or hippie chicks in their 20's to come back to my apartment in an appropriately ambiguously well-off/down-to-earth neighborhood to look at photos or paintings or listen to ethnic music from around the world or drink some unusual wines or liquors from around the world-- whatever seems unique and interesting to them.  That apartment is full of things to pull women's interest with.   Masks and statues from various third-world countries, pictures of me in front of various famous monuments or not-so-famous slums, etc.

They get all impressed by my experiences around the world--most of which actually happened during off time on business trips, not during month-long treks or any such bullshit--and end up banging me like rabbits.

It's awesome.

Last Friday I pulled a 25-year-old half-French half-Chinese tourist, and ended up staying in the city through Sunday morning with a trip around various art galleries with her on Saturday before bringing her back for a repeat.

Every day, hundreds of toursits flood through our gates and it's my job to lead them around and give the same tour, 7 times a day 5 days a week. Needless to say I don't experience a very high level of job satisfaction.

In addition, we do experience higher than average levels of foreign tourists, especially from India and China (yes China, not ""Asia"". China.) While of course I would never think a certain race is genetically inferior or sub-human, I can't help but notice the cultural differences and find a distaste with them. 

For example, if anyone is going to argue for a half-hour over $10, or never take ""we're completely sold out"" for an answer, it'll be an Indian man. A European or Latino man will accept what I'm telling them, but Indian men will fight to the bitter end, even when a manager tells them there's nothing we can do. It will also be an Indian man who reeks of spicy BO. I recognize that some cultures don't worship cleanliness like Americans do, but I can't help being slightly disgusted by the rank odor. 

My problems with the Chinese tourists are their own, and include the same refusal to balk when rejected, as well as their blatant refusal to be considerate. Their children run wild, and they speak very loudly in their native tongue (either Mandarin or Cantonese) while I am attempting to conduct the tour. I know they might not all speak english, but I've seen Russian or Guatemalan tourists translate to their family as I spoke quietly and effectively.

I know it's not just these certain Indian or Chinese families, because massive exposure has only confirmed my bias, and I find I am now much more likely to be patient and accommodating to an American (regardless of color), than I am a foreigner.

* 16, Neil (and Brandon again): My parents were out. I had Neil, Brandon, and someone else over. While Neil and I went upstairs to my bedroom Brandon hung out with whoever else was there. Later that night, Neil would hang out downstairs while I fucked Brandon in my bedroom. 
* 16, Clarence: The first uncircumcised cock I'd ever seen.
* 16, Susan: Messed around ""just for fun"" during sleep overs.
* 16, Eric: Was pressured, and felt obligated to do it. Afterward I learned he didn't use a condom, though he acted like he was putting one on.
* 17, Jesse: Summer camp. First openly lesbian girl I knew.
* 17, ""Richard Johnson"": He was 34. I flirted with him for days while working at this music fest; we hooked up the last day. I thought that meant I'd be his gf, but when he found out how old I was he never spoke to me again. Looking back, I think he used a fake name.
* 18, Les: Had the biggest cock I've ever seen in my life. I cried when I broke up with him to go to college; he cried harder, and has never spoken to me again. My first true love.
* 18, Aaron: Stopped talking to me after someone told him I was a slut.
* 18, Cindy: She awkwardly laid in my dorm room bed while I tried to get her off, and then quietly left in the middle of the night.
* 18, Ashley (Cindy’s roommate): Slept together regularly, but always in secret.
* 18, Cole: He had a small dick, which led to me trying anal for the first time.
* 19, Silas: We met one night at a sushi bar. He had just gotten back from a year long road trip around the contiguous states, Canada, Alaska, and Mexico. I fell for him immediately, and went home with him that night. It snowed that night, which was very rare for that part of the country, and the entire city shut down. It made everything seem magical. We dated for a year until he broke up with me by moving out of the apartment we shared while I was out of town. I was crushed, I'd thought we were going to get married.
* 20, Derrick: Had done some heavy petting with him in high school, but it wasn't until college that we finally hooked up. Fell for him pretty hard, and we had an on-again-off-again LDR until he moved to a nearby town. Our relationship ended with me acting like a crazy person and him moving to TX with the girl he was cheating on me with. We've never spoken again.
* 20, Joe A: Very handsome, but had a fiance in another state. We slept together until I started to feel bad about it.
* 21, Carter: I robbed the cradle briefly with this 18 y/o. Sex was awful so I broke it off.
* 21, Keith: Fucked for the first time at our friend's wedding, but we'd had a PG rated ""relationship"" our freshman year of high school. This felt nostalgic.
* 22, Paul A: Came home with me after a few dates. He announced upon leaving that he wouldn't be calling me again, and asked me not to contact him. No idea what happened.
* 23, Mike: Gets a special place in my heart as the 1st person to tie me to a bed. Only did it a few times before he got seriously involved with someone.
* 23, Brandon (again): Were having phone sex a few times a week. He invited me to his brother's wedding, and brought all kinds of sex toys with him. It was my first time letting someone use toys on me; it was amazing.
* 23, Silas (again): Three years later he contacted me. We got back together for an LDR (he was 2.5 hours away). He'd hurt me badly, so I was emotionally detached this time. We dated for another year and a half. Broke up with him when I moved away.
* 23, Leif: Were friends for a long time before we slept together. When we did, we were both cheating. He's waifish and his hips would bruise my thighs. The sex was awful, but I was in love, and was very sad when he moved away.
* 23, Drew: My local boyfriend while I was dating Silas long distance, neither of them knew. Mutually called it quits when I moved away.
* 24, Matt A: Got together out of convenience/loneliness, eventually moved in together. Sex vacillated between kinky &amp; boring.
* 24, Jake: Cheated on Matt A. with Jake. I slept with this guy the first time while my friend Ed was in town for a visit. We both slept over at Jake’s apartment; Ed on the living room pull out, and me in the other room getting fucked by Jake with drunken abandon.
* 25, Grant: Lived downstairs. Hot sex with mild bondage and lots of wrestling.
* 25, Cori: Cute little pixie with long blonde hair. Spoke Japanese in bed. She broke things off, stating, ""I'm not really into girls.""
* 25, Karen: Fucked her in the bathroom stall at a bar the night I drafted her to my derby team. I was her coach, which made this against the rules.
* 25, EJ: Was totally in love with him, but he was fresh out of an LTR and was wary of getting involved. Mostly it was heavy petting after getting high.
* 25, Megan: Slept with her a few times while she was cheating on her long-distance girlfriend.
* 25, British ONS: Got drunk and took this guy home from the bar. Pathetic sex. He left when I drunkenly started imitating his accent.
* 26, Jacob: Was kinky and had a sybian, but was unbalanced.
* 26, Aidan: Jacob’s best friend. I started sleeping with him behind Jacob’s back, and dated them both simultaneously. Aidan was aware, but Jacob wasn't. He had only been with one other, and he got attached quickly. I broke up with him the day he gave me an iPod for no reason, exactly a week after I broke it off Jacob.
* 26, Kim: Dated for a summer. I helped her move from her 3rd floor walk-up to a 4th floor walk-up. None of her friends showed up, and I ended up calling my friends to help. She told me it was a temp situation and that she'd be moving again soon. Broke it off to avoid having to help again.
* 26, Maria: Dated for about 7 months, but I never fell in love with her. When she started talking about love and moving in together, I broke it off with her.
* 27, Andres: A short man, ~5'3"". Got tipsy and then took a cab to his metal shop. He taught me to weld and rubbed his hard-on against my ass. We didn't have PIV sex, but spent the night alternating between him eating me out and spanking me while I was tied to one of his worktables. The next time we got together I was ready to fuck, but his partner of TEN YEARS (who I did not know about) showed up and started throwing things. I GTFO and went to:
* 27, Leo: Being a bit upset about getting workshop tools thrown at me by Andres’ partner, I went to Leo’s. He's a slutty man and I thought he'd be able to sympathize. He sympathized with me by getting me naked and massaging me. Popped a thumb in my ass and bent over to ask, ""Is it ok if I kiss you?"" I find this order of events hilarious.
* 27, Bryan A: Was upset when he realized I was seeing someone else too, and broke it off by calling me a lot of accurate names.
* 27, G: Started dating just after I started seeing Bryan A. G was also seeing someone else. Dated for 4 months before I knew I wanted to be only with him. He took a little convincing, but we both agreed to monogamy. Dated for 2 years. The sex was great and we were in love.
* 29, Bryan B: 23 y/o fireman. Extra large dick. 8 pack. Mutual fun.
* 29, Rae: Picked this girl up at a party. She insisted she was a top, but begged me to fuck her with my strap-on. I realized she was bat-shit crazy after the slew of messages the next day, and never spoke to her again.
* 29, Will: A friend I fell in love with, even though I was pretty sure the sex would be awful. Only fucked once, because of my drunken persistence/insistence. Not a highlight of my sexual career.
* 29, Ary: Likes to play Dom. Had a few fun times, but PIV sex was awful because he had issues keeping it up. I broke it off, stating that limp dicks are no fun. 
* 29, Ern: The sex was great; he liked to tie me up and spank me. He had a nice dick and was kind. I got scared when he said he loved me and stopped returning his calls. He forgave me, now we're friends.
* 30, Liam: Would come over and fuck me literally all night. He had trouble climaxing, so we'd fuck until I was satisfied.
* 30, Joseph: Mistake. I knew before we made it to bed that I didn't want to do it with him, but still let him take off my clothes and crawl into bed with me. One thrust and I said, ""I need to use the restroom."" I got up and put my dress on and he said, ""You're not going to the bathroom are you? You're going to leave."" I responded, ""Yes"" and did.
* 30, Oren: I went out on a date with this guy after he wrote me a cocky email on OKC. Had great chemistry. He loves sluts, so naturally we started fucking right away. I broke it off after I got tired of him blowing me off and lying to me about his relationship status with his other gf.
* 30, Nik: Met this guy on OKC. Tried to force me to suck his cock. Never spoken to him again.
* 30, Dave: Amazing sex; he was in porn. He broke it off because he didn't reciprocate my feelings.
* 30, Ryan &amp; Anne: Doctor and a nurse. I'm their third, and sometimes see them individually. Ryan has been learning to be a better Dom, as that's what Anne is into. Anne is beautiful and it's easy to make her cum.
* 30, Brad: Dated this Dom briefly, and we had some really hot sessions where he made me cum all over the place. In the end I broke it off with him because I found him too passive outside the bedroom.
* 30, Rob: A voice like gravel, rides a Harley, covered in tattoos of varying absurdity, likes rough sex. Has big fingers and uses them well.
* 30, Paul B: Premature ejaculator.
* 31, Oren (redux): He hired me to work for him this past summer. The sexual tension was incredible, and it was a huge release to fuck him again. Still at it, he still has another gf, but doesn't blow me off anymore. Not ideal, but the sex is the best of my life.

We grew up together and experimented with each other (felt each other up, kissing) but she moved away and it stopped. A few years ago, she moved back in to the neighborhood. I haven't really spoken to her since she was always really quiet but today something strange happened. She was visiting with her brother. As she was passing by me, I joked by trying to trip her with my foot and then she started ""attacking me"" by throwing weak slaps at me. I responded by grabbing her wrists, When I did that, we looked at each other, one of those strange looks. suddenly our siblings (two ~9y.o.) came in and joined us because they thought we were scuffling. 

As our siblings started playfighting, I started gripping one of her legs in between mine. she smiled and the reached for my crotch and I instinctively pulled away. I then started trying to lift her up and grabbed her by the waist. she struggled and eventually I ended up hugging her tits. This went on for about 10 minutes while our siblings kept on trying to join in on ""our fight"" eventually we simmered down and she went into another room. Even now, as I was typing this, she walked by me, I stopped her with my foot and she slapped it and smiled at me. 

Now the reason I am making a big deal out of it is because of our past and the fact that we haven't really spoken in years and this is our first interaction with each other again.

We would hang out all the time and it was the best friendship I ever had. We were sitting together one day and I was upset and in the back of my mind I wanted her to kiss me. I brushed it off and tied it to watching too many male-fantasy teen movies where girl friends hook up. Well when I finally came to terms with my sexuality (bisexual), I told her how I had felt about her back then just to get it off my conscience, and she tried to ""save"" me. She was flattered instead of disgusted ironically but then tried to tell me how even though she loves me no matter what, I shouldn't indulge in such sinful thoughts. She pleaded with me to let her save me through Christ (even though I was already a Christian at the time...?). It made me hate her. I got more and more angry the more self-righteous she got implying that she was a better Christian than me and how I was in need of saving even though I had practiced my faith whole-heartedly at the time. I argued her points regarding sin, throwing her own sin back at her, to get her to see that we are all equal and no one's better than anyone else, but she wouldn't listen and just kept insisting I was the bigger sinner.

 
I wish we still had the friendship we used to have but her intense faith is not something I can handle. Now every time we talk it ends up in a debate about Christianity and I hate it and just want to stop talking to her but I guess I still grasp to what used to be.


Now, because of her and people like her, I can't stand Christianity. I no longer identify as Christian because I don't want people to assume I'm self-righteous. I have my doubts anyway but the issue more has to do with the perspective people have of Christians due to people like my high school friend forcing their perspectives on others.

I've been a /b/tard for a long time and of course the first thing I thought to do was post the pictures. Then someone suggested I try her Facebook. It worked, and I started posting her nude photos on her wall. I wrote some terrible things as captions (look at my sexy body, man the harpoons, etc) and talked to a few of her friends on FBchat, one of whom threatened me and told me I would be arrested. I checked on the account a couple days later to see she had changed her password and deleted all the nudes, but they were up for at least 24 hours. For a little while I thought it was funny... 'stupid whore should've known better' etc. But after having time to think about it, I feel fucking terrible for what I did. It might not be something she thinks about daily but I'm sure she remembers it and it was probably really humiliating.

Confession is a niche reddit. It has one purpose. Confession is the acknowledgment of sin or wrongdoing or transgressions. It's about clearing your conscience, admitting your wrongdoings, and coming to terms with your guilt. (See the sidebar for the four types of confessions, in ""What is Confession"", also posted below). 

&gt; **What is Confession?**

&gt; * a formal admission of one's sins with repentance and desire of absolution.

&gt; * a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime.

&gt; * an admission or acknowledgment that one has done something that one is ashamed or embarrassed about.

So if you submitted something recently and it didn't make it to the frontpage, or was unexpectedly downvoted by /confession readers, it is probably because it fell outside the definition of a confession. If you try submitting it to /r/offmychest or /r/unsentletters or /r/self, it would be more fitting there and likely get a better reception there.

---------

**What r/confession is not:** 

* r/confession is NOT a place to dole out judgment and abuse. Some things that people confess to are pretty bad, and if it's a sincere confession they're feeling pretty bad about it too. The last thing they need is an angry judgmental crowd. They can get that anywhere on reddit, but this place is supposed to be different. We hold ourselves to a higher standard here. That brings us to the following rule: 

&gt; **We are not here to judge others.**
 
&gt; **No personal attacks, we are not here to make people feel bad. If you see any mean-spirited comments, please tell people they are being mean and REPORT them.**

But what about people who take advantage of the atmosphere of non-judgment to brag about bad things they've done? 

* **/r/confession is NOT a place for bragging about bad behavior either.** There are a ton of other subreddits out there for it, but /confession is not the place. If you don't feel bad/guilty/ashamed about it, /r/offmychest is would be a better place. 

* No meta posts. Update posts by people who previously posted a confession are fine (make sure to link to the original in the text of the update). 

-----------

This is also a good time to mention several other similar reddits that provide a valuable place for specific situations and needs. 


/r/Relationships and /r/Relationship_advice, two active helpful communities that answer questions about every kind of relationship and all sorts of relationship situations. 


* /r/Depression, because we all feel down sometimes. 


* /r/SuicideWatch, While it is not a hotline and cannot provide emergency assistance, it is a helpful and supportive community for those people struggling with suicidal thoughts. It is a great place of support though, highly recommended.


* /r/IAmA, if you just have an interesting or crazy situation your life is in or have an interesting story to tell, post what you are, have people ask you about yourself.

* /r/MMFB (Make Me Feel Better), if your life is going pretty badly at the moment and need some cheering up. 

* And there are [many subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub) for confession-themed fiction writers. Maybe one day we'll have a crossover day for confession-themed fiction, but for now it's best to keep it to the various writing subreddits. Or /r/self, or really anywhere but here.

1344520155.0,178,self.confession,xxspf,I really enjoy casual sex.,251,73,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xxspf/i_really_enjoy_casual_sex/,"I'm a female in my early 20s and I *really* enjoy casual sex.

Growing up, I believed that if I enjoyed casual sex, there was something wrong with me. As a young teenager, adults would always tell me that when girls have sex, they become attached, so we need to be careful. I was told that men would want to use me, while I'd want something more. So, when I discovered that a lot of the time, I wanted to have sex with people, and had no desire for a relationship with these men, I assumed I must be emotionally broken.

At this point, I've realized this isn't true.

There's nothing I love more than going out, chatting up an acquaintance, and going home with him. I love the thrill of the first time he touches me, even if it's as subtle as a hand on the small of my back. It makes me shiver. The closer he gets, the more electric I feel. I love the first kiss, the taste of somebody new. I love the way he'll grab me and I'll feel so small in his arms. I love fervently making out until he's kissing my neck and taking off my clothes. I love getting lost in that animalistic passion.

I've found that unless I am actually *dating* someone, I never have any desire to further the relationships of the men I sleep with.

I have safe sex. I don't sleep with absolute strangers, they have to be people I or my friends know in some capacity. He must always wear a condom. I'm on birth control. I don't require that a man buy me dinner, or a drink, before I'll ""allow"" him to have sex with me. I'm not *rewarding* him for anything -- I *also want sex*. All I demand is general human respect, same as I want from anyone I spend time around. I would never sleep with a man in a relationship that I was privy to. On numerous occasions, when I've been made aware that a man I'm interested in sleeping with is object of affection for somebody else, I move on. I refuse to ""compete"" with other women in any way.

And yet, I've still been called a slut. It doesn't matter what I do, how happy I am, or how much respect I try to have for others and myself, if I enjoy casual sex, I will be called a slut. And why? What's the problem? I have a few friends who think casual sex is fine, but the vast majority of people in my life think that women that ""sleep around"" are either 1. Girls with ""daddy issues,"" or 2. Morally-repugnant temptress harlots.

I've never actually explained it before. 

Somehow I found myself in an extremely psychologically/emotionally abusive relationship when I as 17 with someone who had an explosive and violent personality.  It was my first relationship, and things escalated slowly. Before I knew it, he had isolated me from my friends and family. He had a ""me or them"" mentality, and if there was even a question of me choosing someone else over him, I would pay the price. I just didn't have the tools mentally to know how to handle this at the time, so I would just always do my best to carefully not poke the bear.

He tried to have sex with me pretty soon into the relationship. I was a virgin and had wanted to stay that way, I had my reasons. I was clear about my boundaries, but he didn't really care and kept pushing it.  Every time I said no, he would get angry. Eventually anger gave way to violence.  So I ended up caving out of fear of what would happen if I didn't. It was horrible.

Once I gave in, he expected it all the time. I no longer felt like I had an excuse to say no, and he would still get pissed if I did, so I would just do it. And I hated myself for it. Afterward he would usually pass out from whatever drug he was on and I would end up locking myself in his bathroom, curled up in the corner crying. Sometimes it would be particularly horrible and crying wouldn't be enough to calm down, and I would just sit there and punch my thighs over and over to get my frustration out.  Not healthy, and it doesn't make sense, but I was a kid and didn't know what else to do. It happened enough that I had to pretty much wear jeans throughout senior year so no one would see my bruises. 

I don't think I can even explain how much I *hated* myself at the time. I felt weak and pitiful. I started to think I deserved it. I didn't have anyone to tell because I wasn't ""allowed"" to talk to most of my friends, and I didn't think anyone would believe me anyway. When I would try to break up with him, he would snap and go crazy. I was just stuck and alone and didn't know how to get out.  

So here I am, 12 years later, still haunted by this. That relationship forever changed me and the way I approach relationships and men in general.

I still hate myself for what happened, I still feel weak and pitiful and I still slut shame myself whenever things start to escalate physically with someone.

Earlier this evening I was taking a shower and I had to take a shit. Understandably, I didn't want to leave the shower and get my ass cheeks cold on the toilet seat. I suddenly came to the realization that I have never in my adult life tried taking a shit while standing up. And I knew this would be the perfect place to do it. So I slightly crouched, pushed as hard as I can, and shit all over the bathtub. Thankfully it was one of those shits that are fairly solid so it all landed in a neat pile. 

Do you ever have one of those moments where you do something and you're not quite sure why you did it, but you're glad you did it? This was one of those moments. At this point I could tell that I am an easily amused person because I was grinning ear to ear. That didn't last long because now I needed to deal with the mess. And the smell was somehow ten times worse from the hot water. I had to point the detachable shower head and hope that I didn't get sprayed with hot shit water. The pile of putrid shit slowly shrank in size as brown water flowed into the drain. At one point there was just a small turd left so I just stepped on it. I don't know why I did that. I showered off my foot and the rest of the shit residue in the tub and gave the rest of the shower and tub a quick run down with the shower head, removing any tiny specks of shit that I could find. 

I noticed after I went into my room to change clothes and came out that the smell had filled the house. But thankfully it is the middle of the night and I can just let it air out so my Mom won't question why the entire house stinks like shit.

Overall, I consider this a positive experience. I'll probably do it again but only when my Mom is out of town.

1355042322.0,176,self.confession,14ji1s,My boyfriend's put on weight and it has really turned me on and I have been subtly encouraging him,227,51,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/14ji1s/my_boyfriends_put_on_weight_and_it_has_really/,"He said he's put on ~30 pounds in the last year. FWIW, he was pretty thin before, and he's now a few pounds shy of 200, apparently. He's about 6'1 or 6'2"" I think. Not super tall, but a tallish guy. He's grown out of some of his clothes, he's got a noticeable double chin, he has a round belly, chubby cheeks, even his chest is softening up. In comparison to what he looked like before (~150 pounds on that frame) of course he looks fat, but now he seems average like any guy his height. Plus he carries most of his weight in his tummy and face. His legs and arms are still quite lean.

I realized I started finding this to be very attractive because now I get obsessed about what he eats. I have stuff around the apartment, like sodas and sugary juices and snacks I know he'll enjoy. Ugh, I feel dirty and guilty for enjoying it so much and doing sneaky things to encourage him to consume more. I try to counter this overwhelming guilt by making healthier foods or encouraging him to go out to the gym with me, but he never commits. He says he's getting fat, he said he's never been this heavy, always calls himself a fatty (and other various words), that he's gonna lose weight, he's gonna eat less, etc., etc. He's not really proactive about it, though.

But when he does make these comments.. eating less food or something.. it upsets me. For one, I don't like to see someone purposely deprive themselves of something or to be unhappy, but also because I'm scared he'll get skinny again. I don't like feeling his bones. He's not depressed or angry or bitter -- he just makes these comments here and there. I don't know if he's testing me for my reaction or what. I tell him he's not fat, that he's normal, that guys with meat on them is nice, and so on, but am I doing more harm than good by saying that??

I know I'm being selfish by wanting him a way he might not be happy with. But I am so, so, so turned on. My libido has skyrocketed, we have more intense sex. It's.. everything about his growing body that drives me wild. I love his weight pressing down on me, and his belly sagging when he's on top. I love grabbing a handful of flesh when we've having sex, and seeing that big round hairy mountain when I look up at him when I'm giving him a BJ. He has an actual ass. Just the sight of his boxers folding under his gut or seeing him try on clothes that are now too small for him.. I'm turned on just thinking about it.

I know my obsession is getting into dangerous territory when I start getting mad. It's not my place to be mad if he wants to less eat or drink fewer sodas. I tell him he's gorgeous and perfect. I want to tell him, confess how I love his body, and I don't want him to starve himself. I'm trying really hard to back off and not try to influence him, but I'm dealing with the internal argument of how to tell him this. I want to admit to him, but I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll think I've been up to something to no good this whole time, when it's mostly just me appreciating his body. He seems so much happier and content and less prone to mood swings since he's put on weight and eaten food regularly (instead of forgetting to eat for half a day when he was in school), but maybe I'm making a false argument for causation equals correlation. 

I don't know exactly what I'd thought I'd accomplish by confessing. It's good to get it off my chest, though. Maybe seeing my words will help me assess the situation. Maybe I can recognize that I could be a negative influence. I don't know. =(  I am afraid my attraction to him may decrease if he gets skinny again. =( I feel so guilty for enjoying this.

When she was born, I stayed home with her for somewhere around 6 months. I breastfed and didn't really go out all the time like you always seem to see teen moms doing. Nonetheless, there were warning signs that something was off.

I didn't really care very much when she cried, except in that it annoyed me. Where other mom's freak out about germs, safety, milestones, everything... I honestly couldn't have cared less. 

You know how parents are always on about what a chore children are and how hard, etc. and so forth, but then there's ""that moment when they ________ and everything is worth it!!!"" and it's such a freaking heartwarming story that they need to vomit it up all over facebook? Well, I've never felt that. I think her drawings are stupid. When she hugs me, I have to focus very hard not to cringe and shrug her off. I don't care about stupid school plays/concerts/recitals. PTA and other parent-like junk just makes me angry. I can't stand having her in the kitchen ""helping."" I don't like reading to her, playing with her, helping with homework.. hell I can barely force myself to listen to her recount her day. In all of my 12 years as a mom I don't think I've ever once had that happy/fuzzy/warm feeling due to something she's done.I just don't like her much.

I LOVE the weekends when she is with her dad. When she goes to visit family out of town or to summer camp for a week or more, I don't miss her at all. Not only that, I thoroughly enjoy her absence and have to flat out lie to her face when she inevitably asks if we missed her. I am literally counting down the years until she moves out of the house. 

And yet, I try. I smile and laugh and hug and play and all the other crap I'm supposed to do, because I know I'm the one who's way fucked up.

I can fake it, and I think I do a decent job, but I'm well aware that it's not the same as being a truly loving mother and it doesn't seem like there's a damn thing I can do about it except hope that she grows up with minimal issues.

Always thought my sister was normal. Found out I was wrong when I was about 14, so about four years ago.

See, she was pretty popular in high school at the time (she's three years older than me) and had a long time boyfriend. She played on the softball team and got decent grades. Also worked a part time job at a drugstore and never got in any trouble. Well she argued with our mom sometimes but nothing serious.

As a hormonal fourteen year old I found it exciting to snoop around her bedroom sometimes. Yes I enjoyed going through her underwear drawer but it wasn't because I wanted to fuck her, I just liked looking at a real girl's underwear. One day I got it into my mind somehow that she was hiding pot somewhere in her room so I snooped around more than usual. In her closet, under a laundry basket there was a brown box. I opened it and was stunned.

There were no drugs but underneath a stack of old celebrity gossip magazines I found two vibrators, a pack of condoms, bottle of lube, hand cuffs, and a hardcover book-journal thing. Page one was dated two years earlier (when she was 15) and written in her handwriting it described losing her virginity to the boyfriend she was still seeing at that time. In great detail she talked about giving her first blowjob and then letting him ""stick it in just to see what it felt like"". It went on to talk about how great it felt and how much she loved her boyfriend.

This alone blew my mind. Figured she wasn't a virgin but to read about how it went down was amazing. Then I realized that every page of the mostly filled up journal was an entry like this and guess what? They weren't only about her boyfriend. On the first page I got to that made me realize this she explained how she felt guilty but she had cheated on him. After that every page was the same: nothing more about her boyfriend (remember: she was still with him at the time and they'd been dating for years!). Just other guys and her rationalizing her cheating. She described some crazy sex she was having in detail with other guys, some men from work after she started her part time job, some who appeared to be total strangers. At the end of every entry she began writing a number and circling it. Took me a while to realize  the circled number was her tally of the number of guys she had been with. At the time I found that journal that number was 12.

Until she moved to college I used to look at that diary of hers every chance I got. I would always check first to see if she'd added anything new and if there wasn't I'd just find one of her better previous entries and yeah, I would fap. I'm so fucking perverted I even started fapping into her underwear while reading about her slutty behavior. Sometimes I'd just fap while smelling her dirty underwear. Sometimes I fapped while lying down on her bed.

Fuck.

You know it totally changed the way I saw her. I had known before that she was pretty good looking but now I saw her as a sex object. Everyone on reddit jokes about incest but I seriously became obsessed with the idea. Read tons about it: fiction, non fiction. Got banned from a website dedicated to such things for asking if there was an easy way to drug her so I could finally fuck her. I was so fucking stupid.

So fucking stupid. I tried thinking of any way I could hint to her that i wanted to fuck her but thank god I never went through with any of horrible ideas. Well, I did try one and made an ass out of myself. I tried to 'accidentally' walk in on her. I heard buzzing coming from her room and I figured she had to be masturbating with one of those vibrators. She was leaving for college soon so I figured it was the best time to do it because she would be gone and... shit, I don't know what my fucking logic was. I was just stupid. 

Nothing happened. Turned out she was just using some tumbler thing for a school project. Felt like an idiot because I had no idea what to tell her to explain why I'd just barged in on her room like that. It doesn't sound like a lot I know but trust me that moment was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. Her giving me a ""what the hell are you doing?"" look and me realizing I had actually tried breaking through the fantasy into reality. What a god damn asshole.

Never tried any of that shit again. I did something else though. Last year when she was visiting from college for the holidays she asked me to look at her laptop for her because it'd been acting up. After removing a bunch of malware for her I installed a keylogger program. Next day I had all of her passwords and account names. And yeah, sicko perv that I am I still spy on her using this info to this day. I've read sex-chats she's had with boyfriends. I've read e-mails of her arranging to meet up with guys for sexy time. I've seen photos of her doing everything from sucking dick to shoving a dildo in her ass (and no I will not share them). I've fapped to all of this stuff many times.

The tally of the number of guys she'd been with was already 17 before she left for college. Based on the things I've learned from my cyber spying since I'd guess that number is at least three times greater. I know this behavior of hers is self destructive especially since in one e mail she sent to a friend she wrote about a ""hookup"" that sounded more like rape to me. Hell even her friend agreed and advised her to call the cops. My sister never responded to that e mail.

Fuck. She's doing decent at college I guess and should graduate next year and it's not like she's gotten pregnant or anything but I feel guilty every fucking day because I know that a good brother would confront her about this stuff. She has a coward for a brother though. I try to tell myself that I can't do it because there's no way to explain how I know what I've found and all the spying I've done these past few years but you want to know what the truth is?

I like the fact that my sister's such a slut. I like jerking off thinking about her. I love the thrill of seeing her photos and whenever a new one shows up in her e mail account (which is rare) I feel like I've won the lottery. Most of all I like reading her sex chats and e mails and getting into her head and learning all of her secrets. Imagining her doing these things and wishing she made videos.

I'm a bad brother, a pervert, and a total asshole.

My dad was always very open about sex, and whenever I had questions he gave me answers. When I was around 8 I asked him what an orgasm was, and he explained it. Since he was always open about sex, I thought it would be perfectly normal to ask if he could give me an ""orgasm"". He said he would give it some thought, and after a few hours explained to me that if he did do this for me that I couldn't tell anyone else because it was a ""private"" matter. I didn't really understand but I wanted to feel this bliss so I agreed. 
He then performed the deed. I don't really remember if I had an orgasm, but I know it felt amazing. Every day after school I would ask him for an orgasm, and he treated it like playing hide and seek. He never in this entire time penetrated me or asked me to perform sexual acts on him (even though I offered from time to time). 
Around 11 I learned about ""pedophiles"" and how evil they were and how they just wanted to hurt children. I asked him about this and he said most pedophiles did not want to hurt kids, the ones who did are just the ones who make the news. He was still casual about it, treating it like nothing. After a while I stopped asking for orgasms as much, maybe once a week. When I turned 15 he sat down and told me that I shouldn't ""rely on him"" for sexual relief, and that I should venture out with others that were more my age. After that, we just stopped. 
I still love my dad and see him all the time, everyone always says how close we are. I never really understood the other post I see from time to time on here about how kids were scared for life because of their parents performing sexual acts on them. I guess it was just because I never thought of sex as anything bad and my dad was always so casual about it.

For anyone wondering about my mom, she died when I was younger.

I was on Omegle awhile ago just looking to get off with someone watching. Yeah yeah, judge me, but I was in the unmonitored section! I'm not gay (bicurious maybe), but the whole disembodied cock touching turns me on. That's beside the point though, so anyway, I find a guy. Nice dick, decent abs. I figure I won't find anyone better, so I'm good to go and he's already out. 

We talk about some porn, discuss the whole ""I'm not really gay"" thing, admit that we probably fool around with a guy though if we could pick him, and then we're off to the races so to speak. A little while later, we finish, and my goodness, the load he shot was impressive. So impressive that my post-fap shame was essentially bypassed. We kind of played chicken with disconnecting and eventually he said we should do it again sometime. With my lack of post-fap shame, I agreed, and we set up ""fake"" Skype accounts and added each other.

Fast-forward a couple weeks to two nights ago. We've ""done the deed"" several times together on camera. Maybe 2 or 3 times a week. Up until Tuesday night, we'd had never shown anything but chest down to cock in the classic ""laying down with head propped up"" position, but that night just before we got going, he adjusted his computer to get into a good position, and he accidentally flashed his face for about 3 seconds. 

The guy looked exactly like my one of my brother's best friends. *Exactly*. I've known this guy for years. Played baseball with him. Been to parties with him. Went/go to school with him. I know what he looks like. I know what his body looks like. There's no doubt in my mind that this is him. 

It took me by surprise, but I didn't log out. We continued as usual. I feel weird about the whole thing, but I have no plans to stop. I'm not doing it just to get off anymore; it's actually become fun to watch him.

More and more posts that are not true confessions.   Most are cryptic heartfelt posts where one anonymous person professes his or her love to another anonymous person.  And there's nothing wrong with this.  But these are not confessions, they're professions.   
  
*A profession is not a Confession.*  
  

**These posts would be better suited for [Off My Chest](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/)** **or [Unsent Letters](http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters)**.
  
  
Confession is a niche reddit.  It has one purpose.  I'd rather have only a few posts a day that are actual confessions than a dozen ambiguously vague/cryptic passive aggressive emo rants about lovers lost and unrequited love.  Confession is the acknowledgment of sin (or one's sinfulness).  It's about clearing your conscience, admitting your wrongdoings, and coming to terms with your guilt.  
  
/r/Confession is not the rants and raves or missed connections sections of Craigslist personals.
  
And to be perfectly honest here, whomever you're anonymously professing your unrequited love to is in all likelihood never EVER going to see it.  Buck up and tell them how you feel for real.  
  
True Love is fleeting.  Catch it if you can.

&gt; **What is Confession?**  

&gt; * a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime.  

&gt; * an admission or acknowledgment that one has done something that one is ashamed or embarrassed about.  

&gt; * a formal admission of one's sins with repentance and desire of absolution.  

&gt; * [often humorous] intimate revelations about a person's private life or occupation, esp. as presented in a sensationalized form.

It absolutely hurts to admit this because we've become so close and you're my sister-in-law but you are so not ready to be responsible for two young children.

You constantly refuse to care for them and you act like a teenager. You always leave your brother and I to look after them, sometimes without asking. You spend money you don't have on things you don't need to fill a hole somewhere inside you, but what you should be doing is teaching your children to talk, potty-training them instead of just assuming it will ""happen eventually."" You don't need to worry about who is online on your laptop or game console when you have responsibilities directly in front of you.

I understand it's hard, especially when your SO isn't around, but being a mother isn't a job you can just quit whenever you want and pick back up whenever you feel like taking Facebook pics with your ""little angels."" Your parents are also tired of your bullshit and they talk about it when you aren't around. I know why they won't just come out and tell you ""Watch your kids, take care of your kids."" It's because if they, or anyone for that matter ever tries to criticize you, not attack you, but try to help you realize what you need to do, you take it as if they are saying you're the most horrible mother that ever existed. No one ever says that to you and yet, you always take it that way. I think it's because you hate hearing the truth. You don't want to face the fact that you need a job and you need to stop relying on everyone else for money and childcare. So you over react and take on the role of the victim. Everyone is just out to get you, but, oh no, how could you have ever done anything wrong? How could these people criticize YOU when they don't even know you, right? 

You know what really makes me mad? When you joke about having no idea where your kids are at the moment. You say something like ""Hahah I don't even know where my kids are right now"" like it's some cute joke your friends online will find funny. I hope they don't. It's not funny. If your son is in the kitchen and got access to a knife ( something I've seen him get before) would it be funny then?

Finally, clean up your fucking messes. Stop acting like a child and clean up after your kids. This isn't your goddamn pig pen. Clean up the trash in your room, pick up your dirty clothes, stop letting your kids throw food on the floors and pick it up if they do, IMMEDIATELY. For god sakes, learn how to sweep. You are, what, like 30 years old. You honestly think having to sweep the floor 3 times and it still being dirty is ""cleaning?"" Grow the fuck up and stop making everyone else take care of your stuff. How are you going to do this once you are truly on your own?

I know this is a harsh reality for you to face, but it has to be done. What on Earth do you expect? That your parents won't ever get tired of you mooching. That everyone will watch your kids so you can sleep and talk to your little fuck buddy all day? Seriously, start being the mother you, for some damn reason, delusionaly perceive yourself to be.

She's been my best friend since grade school. We aren't like most girl-friends - we don't have petty resentments or stupid fights. We're always honest and considerate. We lived together most of college, and after until she moved in with her future husband. I was her maid of honor. Shit. Honor. I'm a joke. 

She's always there for me. She's all the family I have, my father died when I was a baby and my mom passed last year. Until last weekend, I have always done right by her too. 

The three of us were at their house, playing games and drinking wine. I live just a few blocks away and walked as I usually do. It's an easy walk home, or I stay in the guest room. That night I drank a lot, it was such a delicious pinot noir, and found myself really tanked. I wanted to go home to feed/spend time with my cat. It was raining heavily with a strong cutting wind. Her husband hadn't had but a glass or two and was fine to drive and offered to take me home. 

We've always gotten along fine, he's almost as good a friend as she is. He wanted to come inside and say hello to my cat and see my latest painting. These aren't unique events; he loves my art and my cat. I was having trouble standing and slurring my speech. He picked me up and carried me to my bed. We were joking and laughing about what a lush I am. He laid me down and started to take my shoes off for me. It was oddly intimate for him, but I didn't stop him. He gave my foot a little rub after he took the first off and it felt heavenly. He took the other off did the same. I told him how good it felt. I don't remember exactly what he said but it was something about me deserving it. And then I felt his hands start down my leg.

""I can't really rub them with these stalkings on, can I?"" I should have stopped him. I shouldn't have let it get that far. I know I adjusted my skirt down to make sure my panties were covered. He slipped off my thigh-highs easily, commenting that he appreciated how nicely I dress. Something shut off in my head. He was no longer my best friend's husband. He was a sweet, handsome man rubbing my feet. I allowed myself to thoroughly enjoy it, moaning in pleasure. His strong hands worked up my calf, then the other. I was lucid enough to tell myself he'll stop at the knee. He didn't, his hands went up my thighs and grazed my panties. 

I should have stopped it. Right there. I didn't. I wanted to have him, wanted to feel him in me. He went down on me, bringing me to climax several times. He undressed me, I undressed him. It wasn't hurried, I can't blame getting swept away in the moment. We had sex. Twice. I had never thought of him sexually until that night.

After he finished I could see the clarity invade his mind. His face changed. He almost started crying. I did too. We held each other wordlessly, sharing our regret. He got very business like as he got dressed, asking if he was going to tell her or if I should. I started crying harder.  I said I couldn't even think about that right then. I had not only betrayed my friend but had to break her heart. 

He left awkwardly and I threw up. He came back while I was brushing my teeth. He hugged me and wanted to make sure I was ok. He was talking really quickly, about how he was worried about me and didn't want me to feel used or cheap. I told him I was ok, and he should get home. I didn't sleep that night, alternating nausea and panic. I smoked for this first time since college.

He told her the next night when she got home from work. He called me before, to let me know what was coming. I didn't know what to do, bracing myself for the worst. I received a text from her ""You are dead to me"". I deserve it. A mutual friend reports that they haven't broken up or anything like that. I sent her an email pouring my heart out about sorry I am, but it's not enough. I will never have her trust again.

It's been a week now. I'm still a mess. I have no idea how I'm going to live with this guilt or or live without her friendship.

Apparently he raped a girl a few weeks back. She was 14 and he's 23; it was consensual but that's considered a major felony in my state (east coast, though I don't want to disclose where exactly). He knew she was a minor. They had sex for about a week and she comes from a troubled family so it's likely she was emotionally fragile at the time.

I haven't seen my friend since the arraignment, only watched the breaking news video of him getting sentenced to 15 years while standing there in a jumpsuit, looking miserable. And fuck...

We can support another child and we aren't at a bad place now. There is no justification, I know. I suck.

EDIT: I told my husband what I did. He looked at me for a second and burst out laughing. He asked me if I sperm jacked him and I said I guess I did. I was really embarrassed and ashamed but after awhile of him laughing uncontrollably, I joined in. By the end of it we were nearly in tears. He wasn't upset or mad and didn't even feel betrayed. He said it was his game plan to wait but if I got pregnant now, he wouldn't be in least bit upset. So...I guess it wasn't as serious as I thought. Thanks for the input, people.

I don't believe her because we are just two poor students and I don't want to make any sacrifice for someone else child. She doesn't even want to report her rapist because her past drug problems could cause her to lose/share the custody and there's no evidence to convict her rapist.

We were inseparable and did basically everything together. When we were in our teens, as many teenagers do, we messed around with drugs and alcohol. By the time we hit 17, we had tried almost every drug imaginable. Cocaine, Meth, Painkillers, LSD, DMT, Methadone, Weed (obviously) and many, many others. The only thing we steered away from was Heroin. 

One day, with another friend, I injected a cap of dope. I'm not descriptive enough to explain what it felt like so I'll shamelessly steal someone else's description. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/jdugj/rdrugs_ama_series_heroin/c2bb2rp

Anyway, I felt like this drug was the best thing that had ever happened to me so I decided to share it with Adrian. He was initially reluctant but after a lot of effort on my part I convinced him to do so. 

Not long afterwards we became hardcore addicts. I'm talking shooting up daily before we even finished senior year of highschool. After 3 years, being disowned by our families, and a brief stint of homelessness on his part. We decided to clean our act up. We detoxed, went to rehab and in less than a year, I was going to college studying business management. He also managed to quit (or so I thought) and started to work in his parents business.

Anyway, fast forward a decade or so later to the present when we are in our early to mid 30s. I'm married with 2 kids. He's married but with no kids yet. I have a good job, a car, a mortgage, and a loving family. I haven't touched anything besides alcohol and cannabis, which I only smoke on rare occasions, in almost 10 years. He is doing the same as me except without kids. We remained good friends

About 3 days ago, Adrian called me (we hadn't spoken in about 3 months since around august) and informed me he and his wife had contracted HIV. He then proceeded to tell me that he never truly quit heroin, somehow managing to keep doing it at least weekly around his work and other commitments. As he and his wife (who he has been dating since highschool) have not had sex with anyone else in their life, he must have contracted it from a dirty needle. He then must have spread it to his wife though sex.

The diagnosis of HIV has let to him confessing his drug use to his wife who was oblivious, she has moved out and is probably filing for divorce soon. His workplace heard of his drug use and fired him. (he is no longer working for his parents ) And most of his friends have abandoned him. 

If I had never pressured him into trying heroin, all this would have never happened, I can't help but feel it's all my fault.

TLDR: I got my best friend addicted to heroin in his teens, he never quit, got HIV and infected his wife unintentionally in his 30s.

EDIT: spelling and grammar

EDIT 2: He just called me again about half an hour ago and told me his wife has officially filed for divorce, less than a fortnight since he confessed.

I'm not saying I didn't have my moments of homophobia as a teen in the 80's/90's, but I like to think I've largely out grown it to as an adult.
  
Through my parents, I've known several gay couples, M/M and F/F for most of my life. A year or two ago I spoke at the Eulogy for the funeral of one of the gay men I basically grew up knowing. 

But one thing that consistently creeps me out, and its a visceral gut reaction is when it comes to crossdressers, genderflexible people, and a certain section of transsexual people (generally M2F trans people). 
  
I can't get past it.  I can't stand seeing them on TV, and if I find out that someone's kinks include crossdressing it is a complete deal breaker. I don't want to even talk with them, much less hang out around them.

I don't understand why I have such an intense hang-up about that kind of thing.

**Edit:**
For those that asked, I think that there are two parts to my problem w/ these folks.

1. I've only run into two MTF trans people in real life. They were a couple? friends? that were attending the same event I was. And quite frankly they pretty much pegged the dial on my Weird-Shit-O-Meter. My problem with them was  thier repeated Invasions of my own personal space, pushiness, and just generally being overtly skeezy in an otherwise ""normal"" public event.   But I was already uncomfortable with MTF in general before meeting those two.
  
Was it a ""These guys are really fucking weird, AND Trans"" or a ""These Trans guys are Really Fucking weirdos""?   I don't know, but my first association w/ MTF definitly points back to those two.

2. I think my other problem is the folks who can't pass.

There were so fucking many people every time, but it was a big place, and with cheap access. 

The pool had these underwater jets that would blast water while being randomly rotated by the plastic propeller that was in there. These water jets were meant for massaging your back while you leant up against the side of the pool, but horny young me quickly found out that these water jets were awesome to massage your tiny pre-teen dick with. I stuck a finger into the hole of the water jet and stopped the plastic propeller from spinning, so it would only send the water beam in one direction: my crotch. I would cling onto the side of the pool, while underwater with my body curled up in a near-fetal position with my crotch being in front of the underwater beam. 

Since I wasn't tall enough to be able to have my head above water while pleasuring myself, I'd have to hold my breath and go under the water and masturbate in these 30-second bursts and decide when my final dive would come as I would approach orgasm. 

I don't even think I could produce sperm back then, maybe a tiny bit, but however little came out of me probably stayed within my shorts. It was a very hot, probably about 40 square metres pool filled with fucking people, mostly older. We were probably 20-30 people in the pool most of the time, and now that I think about it, I must have been fucking obvious in my dirty endeavours, just hanging onto the side of the pool, curled up against that water jet, and with my shorts probably looking like they were about to come off. 

It was awesome when there would be some hot chicks in the water in bikinis that I could look at underwater (I wore diving goggles). I wonder if I could have ever impregnated anyone there by releasing my pre-teen sperm into the hot water, but I doubt it.

Nothing I’ve ever done has lingered with me quite as much as certain things I haven’t done. The un-done is haunting. Because a fantasy is like a ghost, ever immediate and ageless, easily summoned and nearly impossible to exorcise. You know what I mean. You’re a man of feeling, you throb just like I do. 
	We never had sex. We barely even touched. We hugged hello and goodbye, and you rubbed my shoulders for a thoughtful moment the last time I saw you. As I was turning to leave, you gently stroked my cheek. But we’ve never shared a single erotic caress. This makes everything we did so much more erotic. The fact that you were trying so hard to be good, the friction of your struggle, as if you could barely contain the massive excitement you felt from simply sharing the same room as me – the idea that I was irresistible to you, so you didn’t trust yourself around me. All of this just turns me on. 
	Remember when we got coffee, and I accidentally brushed the toe of my boot against your shoe? My boot! It was so thick that I barely felt it. I thought I had hit myself against the table. But you nearly jumped out of your skin. You said “No, no.” My god, you were so nervous! Now, as the haze of my own innocent and heady crush on you subsides, I finally see what was going on: sexual tension. It was so thick and delicious, you could have cut it with a knife and eaten it for dinner. It would have comfortably served four. 
	Yes, you love your wife. Of course, neither of us wants to hurt her. We cherish our friendship too much. You respect my mind and admire my taste in poetry. But none of that changes the fact: you want to fuck me. You desperately want to shove your dick into my tight wet 24-year-old vagina over and over again. You want to touch me in all the places you’ve never seen and only imagined in your dirty poetic mind. You want to take my small soft hands in yours, and guide them all over your body, showing me where and how you like to be touched. You want to gently stroke my cheek while thrusting yourself into me and kissing my breasts and neck. You want all this and I want it too. I want to feel you climax, to watch the look of agonizing pleasure on your face as you feel me gripping you in my own orgasmic pulses. I want all of this more than you can even imagine – and I know you can imagine a lot.
	As you said, it doesn't matter what we want. It just isn't a good idea. But I don’t think I’ll be able to forget about what never happened. And I don’t think you will either.

UPDATE: So, I turned a part of this into a poem (hint: it was the dirtiest part) and I asked him if he ""wanted to read this poem that I wrote?"" and he said yes so I just sent it to him... let's see what happens now. 

UPDATE 2: He said he read it as if he had written it himself. Oh god, the ache of my lust.

We're still resolved to remain chaste and stay friends. No, I didn't throw myself at him, and he didn't interpret me that way.

But on the other hand, Mother's Day is a reminder that I hate my bio-mom.

I'm not talking hate as in ""I hate the smell of fresh onions"". This is active, unmitigated loathing.  The last words I said before I broke ties were that when she's finally buried, I look forward to salting the earth above her as a warning to everyone that poison rests there.

She chose to bring her children into a cult.  She's chose to fight every member of the family to keep us in a religion where we spent the next 15 years undergoing psychological and emotional abuse.  I hold her indirectly responsible for my brothers death and she's enabled my sister to abandon any and all potential she may have had.  

For awhile I went to a therapist with experience in recovery from cults.  It helped with a lot of the baggage but this isn't something that I've moved past.  Some days I want to let go of it, but others I'm not so sure.  In a lot of ways I want to keep it just as it is, because forgiveness might give her the chance to get her hooks back into me and my family.  

That's part of it.  But there's a more honest reason below that.  

I keep that hate for her going because, even if I never get to see it, I hope that Mother's Day hurts her as much as she hurt me.

I lost my V-plates to a complete stranger I met on an app called 'are you interested?' 

I was 19, a relatively normal girl with many friends and was considered the life of the party, the girl everyone knew for being funny and entertaining. As wonderful as it sounds, I never had any interest from men, I had a few people ask me on dates and so on, but the feeling wasn't mutual. 

I had never been kissed or touched in a sexual way, and that's what I craved. From a young age all I wanted to know was what sex felt like, experience the intimacy of it. So, one evening in June, I downloaded this app and found someone I liked the look of, and we discussed meeting up. 
We talked about kinks, what we would like to do to eachother, it was hot and exciting, I loved knowing a man I had never met wanted to fuck me.
We met on the 19th of June, 2010. We met in the hotel lobby, had awkward small talk over a double whiskey, and silently went to the hotel room. 
As soon as we got in he was all over me, forcing me against the wall, his mouth all over me. I remember my head spinning, not knowing where to start, I had never kissed before so everything was scarily new.
He must of noticed my reluctance, he undressed me, laid me down and took over, for which I never thanked him for.
We had sex 3-4 times, during which he fucked me with a dildo, had me lick cream from his body, tie me to a chair in the room with bondage tape and lick me out.
In the morning, we got dressed, checked out and left in separate directions. No goodbye, just a smile and a nod. I didn't want anything more, I got what I came for. I went home and reminisced, I was ashamed about what i did, but at the same time was thankful for it, I felt that I was desirable to someone out there, and not just the funny girl with the friendly face and average body.

I did it again in August, just after my 20th birthday with someone new, he wasn't as good as the first guy I was with. The hotel was run down and he was quite rough with me, this time it really felt slutty. The whole experience drilled it in to me that what I was doing was gross. I swore I wouldn't do it again..

Until November that year. When I Met up with a guy on new years eve. I drove an hour to his place and spent the weekend with him. 
I'm still with him now, we have been together 2 years this year, have been living together for 1 year. He is amazing. He completes me and makes me feel more at peace with the decisions I made when I was young.

I was young and stupid and i put myself in danger, god knows what could of happened to me. If my theoretical daughter did what i did, i would be disgusted. But it's part of my life I don't really regret, it had taken me here, to one of the happiest points of my existence.

I have no idea what I'm doing.]

I hope you can forgive the throwaway. Here's what happened. I became stepdad of this girl when she was barely 7, and we had a pretty good, normal father-daughter relationship until she hit around 14. I was in some personal lows at the time, and tended to escape in porn/sex. I gradually found myself thinking about my stepdaughter sexually for a period of time. Damn that sounds horrible. But there's no other way to put it. I didn't do anything to act on this except for one evening we were watching TV alone and she asked for a massage, and I gave her one that to me felt pretty sensual. I didn't touch her private parts or anything, but I did convince her I needed to massage her back and upper rear end beneath her clothing (her shirt/bra, and pants a few inches below her waistline). I was aroused, but I don't know how evident it was. I stopped after a while and nothing was said. Just finished our show, went to bed. The next several days I felt indescribably awful. Finally I decided to talk to her and try to give her a plausible way to tell herself nothing bad happened. I said I wasn't thinking about how grown up she'd become and that it was actually not ok for a male to massage her like that anymore, and I shouldn't have, and I was just being oblivious and thinking of her as a small child and I was sorry. I don't know if she bought this or not. 

I've never done anything like this since, and feel awful about it every day. Since then our relationship has been more distant, I think, unless that's just in my head personally. I know I fucked up, but I really need some perspective. I tend to either feel like I've ruined her life and deserve to die, or tell myself it didn't do any harm, with no in between. Can you help me see whether this is something I should just leave alone, because she might have just missed the whole sexual side of it? Or is it something I need to be accountable for in some further way? She's totally messed up now at 19, and I think it's probably my fault. I don't know how to fix this. I want to fix it but I don't know how. Should I bring it up again and acknowledge what really happened on my end so she can get closure if she is tormented by it? I don't know what to think. Am I going to go to jail? Should I go to jail? I know I'll get some ""go kill yourself"" responses, and that's fine. But if there are any survivors of this kind of thing, or people who can help me see reason and morality and what to do, please help.

It was hard, I found it hard to empathize (I never knew my father and I despise my mother.) About a month later, she could tell I got pissed by the way she was taking it out on me. She was mourning and I should have been more understanding. Two months later, she stopped mentioning her father but she was clearly depressed. She gained ten pounds, which I was fine with. She continued to be distant and stopped talking to me. Then she told me that she wanted to just end it. Who was I to stop her? If her life was worse than death, who was I to let her suffer? I told her that I loved her and that I didn't want her to die.

 She killed herself a few weeks before our 2nd anniversary. I could have gone to the professionals but I didn't. I am responsible for her death. I went to the funeral and pretended I never saw it coming.

The bad kind.,217,55,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1bt4bt/im_a_pervert_the_bad_kind/,"I'm a pretty normal guy and always have been. I started looking at porn when I was 13 or so (early 20's now) and it was all the conventional shit. Things evolved out of that though, and now I'm into some fucked up things.

 Looking back the first sign that anything was different was [this](http://www.neozaa.com/playgame.php?id=547) game. The girls weren't anything unusual, but 14-year-old me got off to that game like nothing else because it made me *work* for my porn. I could see tits anywhere, but those specific tits took effort. The next milestone I hit was my first girlfriend. It was a shitty relationship, but it was around 8th grade so I think that's to be expected. We dated for a month or two and she was my first kiss and the first boob I ever felt. It got weird when my best friend *also* started fooling around with her. We'd each take a boob, or she'd get off on webcam for both of us and it honestly felt fine until she started expressing a preference for him over me. That's when it really started. I didn't like the idea that there were pictures of her out there that I *hadn't seen*, so I started sneaking onto his computer to snag any pictures of her that were there. The habit should have stopped with her, but it didn't. My friend got more and more popular and more and more girls would send him nudes and I would sneak in, grab them, and sneak out. I got a rush from seeing things that I know I shouldn't.

My little habit has since grown into a compulsion, I don't just grab from my friend anymore, and I've gotten a lot more sophisticated.

Whenever I know that a piece of information exists now, I *need* to see it. I break into emails and phones and accounts of people that I've ever met. I look around for revealing pictures, but I also just look for any information that I know I shouldn't have. Private conversations, SSN's, you name it. What's weird is that I don't enjoy seeing the information itself as I do just *sorting* it all. I have neat little folders with names and information and it grows every single day. Sure, I still get off to the pictures, but knowing that I found something that someone tried to hide is such a rush. It's become so much more about the game and so much less about the prize. I never *do* anything with the information I get. I've never even thought about identity theft or blackmail, I just enjoy the detective work.

I know that what I'm doing is wrong on so many levels, but it doesn't *feel* wrong. I don't feel bad about it even though I'm consciously aware that I should. Other than this, I lead a totally normal life. I have a wonderful girlfriend and I socialize and enjoy parties and movies and art, I just have this absolute *compulsion* to find what people have tried to hide.

I'll be giving it all up in two months when I'll be moving in with my girlfriend. I'll put it on a hard drive with every type of security I can think of and throw it into storage. Once I do that I'll get on every subreddit I can think of and give a complete rundown on personal security and what makes it easy for people like me (and worse people) to do what we do.

My oldest son (adopted), 25, has graduated from college and moved on with his life. My youngest is 21 and off to college in another state. 

My wife and I have separated after 20 years of marriage and she moved out in August. We're at a point in our relationship where we can't stand to look at each other. But when we're apart too long, we seek comfort in each others' arms and she comes home until we want to vomit at the sight of each other. It's totally messed up.

We've always been pretty open about our sexuality. We've swung with a few other couples over the years and we've both done the deed, so to speak, when it comes to gay/lesbian sex. 

Well tonight I got onto Craigslist looking for a guy to hook up with. I've been in that kind of mood lately, so I decided that I'd act on it. So I posted an ad saying that I wanted to top for someone. 

I don't know why, but a 19 year old kid (a kid in my eyes, at least) answers the ad and says he wants to hook up. At first I thought that he must not have seen my age (43 years old) but he said that he was into older guys. So I bit and had him come over when he got off work at midnight. 

He was so fresh faced and obviously nervous. I felt like the most perverted, creepiest asshole ever as I led him to the couch and put the moves on him. He told me about his family, and how his dad was never there. His fucked up relationship with his mom, and how he wants to come out to her but knows she'll ridicule him for being gay, maybe worse. The entire time I just kept thinking about how I would feel if this were my own son being taken advantage of by some horny old pervert. 

Even worse, he was so inexperienced that it was hard for me to gain entry. A voice in my head kept screaming at me that this was wrong, that this boy was two years younger than my youngest child, but I continued. The whole time, he kept apologizing to me for being too tight and not being ""ready right away."" 

When it was over, he clung to me in the bed while I experienced the harshest feelings of guilt and heartache that I've ever been through. The day that my wife moved out of the house is the closest feeling that I have to compare it to. He just wanted to snuggle and be held, and he told me that he felt safe in my arms. I didn't have the heart to show him the door right away (I normally do with one night stands) so I just held him until he fell asleep. 

He's still sleeping in my bed but I can't be there with him right now. I truly feel like I became a monster tonight, and I have no idea how I'm going to look myself in the mirror from now on.

Years back, in middle school, I looked at loads of CP--usually pretty hardcore porn mixed with softcore. I eventually stopped during high school for various reasons. I used Tor as well as a few clearnet sites to browse through porn, and traded on now defunct IRC channels.

In my 8th grade year, I was watching a video that looked strangely familiar. It was probably the most average and bland CP videos: it was m+b, the man was significantly older and the boy was about 12-15. When I was watching the video, jerking it like the horny teenager that I was, I looked at the boy's face. He was my classmate from my earth sciences class. His asshole was being stretched by his father's cock, while he lay there motionless. I was so certain it was him--the *star* just had the same facial structure and mannerisms of my classmate.

The next school day, I remember staring at him idly. He wasn't too particularly different, he seemed to fit in quite well. I didn't want to ask him if it were actually him in the video; it would be too awkward. He just seemed too average to be in a CP video, from what I've thought. I always imagined that the children ""stars"" would act differently--abused and neglected, or withdrawn. He was just normal. Because of this, I doubted myself. I had no proof it were actually him, it may have just been a very similar look-a-like.

Throughout high school, I actually became quite acquainted with him. We were friends--nothing more. We weren't truly friends, but we talked every so often. As high school came to an end, we exchanged our Steam names and gamed together. I still had a thought that it were him in the video, but still I didn't feel confident enough to ask (would it be a faux pas to ask if someone was a child porn star?). 

Graduation came. We were graduation partners. We walked up to the stage, got our diplomas, walked off. I saw my family afterwards, he saw his. He motioned to me to come over and talk; that's when I discovered it. It was indeed him. His father with the same beard, and almost the hairstyle stood there. Him standing next to his father was an almost perfect depiction of the video's thumbnail. 

I was somewhat disturbed, but said nothing. He's going to a prestigious university, fully waived with scholarships. I'm across the country going to a less-than-adequate state university, working a fulltime job to cover tuition. We still talk daily.

I'm going to first talk to him about it. I'm going to visit ""his area"" in about 2 weeks to talk to a transfer advisor. I was thinking about just dropping by and getting lunch with him. I thought about the possible repercussions about waiting and I decided that it would be better to see how he would like to proceed: if he wanted to do it himself or if I ought to tell. I did happen to find a state trooper's email who seems like somebody that would be able to help (I will probably be using an anonymous email). After we talk, I will probably be sending the trooper an email. If the trooper suggest I get a lawyer, I might but I wouldn't really want any involvement (I would be liable for providing a false accusation as well as incriminating myself, and the state can file charges).

My wife had an affair and I recently found out. It was going on behind my back for 2 years. Stupid me, huh?

Well, I left and got crazy, I'm an athlete so I was strict with everything I put in my body and what I did. I made sure I always got my sleep. I made sure I trained appropriately. Everything was on course for me. But when I walked, I walked away from my healthy lifestyle too.

Just in a few short months I have slept with many women. Some I just met that evening. I started using coke and uppers to keep me going. I don't sleep. I eat like shit. I don't train anymore. I feel like hell and I need to get back on track.

Tonight might have been it for me. I woke up with a girl I just met. We snorted coke until midnight, screwed all night and into the morning, and when I was done and coming off the high, I almost started crying.  Since i got home, I have been crying and severely depressed.

The thing is the reason my wife had her affair was one of the same reasons. She met an old boyfriend online and started hanging out and doing drugs together. Since it wasn't what I wanted out of her she did it all behind my back and got hooked with him and what she was doing.

Now I'm probably worse off than her. My life restarts now.

**Edit:**  I just want to say that you guys are fucking incredible. I planned my week out and what I'm going to do with getting back into training. I'm looking forward to this slow trek back. 

**Edit 2:** Sick as hell last night but I still got up and did my morning workout. Going to hit the gym tonight to do a little cardio and core. I hope I can ease into this all week and make it a habit like it once was. Cutting everything off completely is the only way I can do things. Either I'm all in or all out, I'm not good at half-stepping. So this is the only way. Thanks again everyone. This place is a blessing.

**Edit 3:** I'm still going to bed early and getting up to train. I do have a hard time falling asleep, but that doesn't keep me in bed to skip a training session. I feel shitty I guess from quitting all this crap cold turkey. I know it'll take me a while and I will keep you posted on my recovery. If you want to know. 

**Edit 4:** Still going. I couldn't train this morning because I had to keep my little girl. But that was worth not doing it. I am still clean though. I haven't even had a beer since Saturday. And that's tough living in a home with another single guy and having a fridge stocked with it. Last night I bought a huge pack of waters and filled the fridge with that to help keep me focused when I open it.

**Edit 5:** Still at it. Clean. Sober. Training - though that's a bit slow. Dropped a bunch of weight. Looking and feeling good. A lady friend has really taken to me and she treats me better than anyone has in decades. So, I guess this is how you're suppose to feel about yourself, huh?

The kids next door used to play in the ditch as much as the playground every fucking day after school, right under three windows in my house. They'd squeal constantly and after work all I wanted to do was relax. 

I planted a few dozen IV needles the places the kids played. Their parents don't let them play in the ditch or the playground any more and now all I get is blowthroughs who come and play a bit then go, unaware.

I'm glad they've stopped the constant noise but I feel bad about the kids who have to live on the other side of a playground they can't use. It wasn't the playing that bothered me, only the noise.

After threats against me from some of you below for what's nothing but a harmless (if a little scary) act, I think it's eased my conscience about how I dealt with this problem.

I know it's not his fault that his parents don't believe in any form of discipline, whatsoever. 

Not only do they not discipline him, if anyone else speaks so much as a cross word to him they go all ""momma bear"" (God, I fucking hate that phrase) and ""daddy bear"" on them. You are not allowed to scold, not allowed to tell him no, not allowed to anything, really.

My mom used to babysit for them all the time but stopped because they tore her a new one for scolding him when he was harassing the cat. I'd like to point out that the cat, though 18 years old, has no problem with any of the other three grandkids. 

So now they have to pay for daycare, which I know they're stressed about. But you know what? Bed. Made. Lie. It's no use making vague remarks to me about how much you'd save on daycare if someone would just watch him a couple of times a week, or how you'd love a date night if you could just find a babysitter. There's a reason no one wants to watch your kid who isn't being paid big bucks for it.

I know how they raise their kid is none of my business so I stay entirely out of it. I smile and nod when they bring up the kid and change the subject. But they've started to notice that I'm different with little ""Damien"" than I was with my other nieces and nephews. 

With the rest of them I was always happy to babysit them, including all the shit work of changing diapers, etc. Now that they're older I take them to movies, museums, parks, take an interest in their interests, and generally try to be the best aunt ever. Because they're genuinely good people, these kids, and I love the shit out of them. I would lay down my life in a heartbeat for every one of them.

But since Damien has been old enough to start screaming and punching I've been avoiding babysitting him at all costs. I know, although they don't say it, that his parents feel the difference and are hurt. But the one time I tried to explain that I don't feel comfortable watching a child I don't have the authority to discipline my brother made me out to be some sort of child abusing monster. 

Fuck that. I'm not advocating kicking the shit out of kids over trivialities. I'm talking about giving a kid a time out because he got jealous of his younger cousin and started beating her over the head with a wooden block. If I can't do that, I can't watch your kid.

None of my other siblings mind if I tell their kid off for acting up. In fact, they encourage it. Not that I really need to, because they do such a good job of parenting that I can just focus on being the fun aunt.

And I would like to be the fun aunt to Damien too. But as long as my brother and SIL keep being the way they're being, I can't. And that sucks. Come to think of it, maybe it's not my nephew but my brother and his wife I'm starting to hate. 

How two such formerly intelligent people lost all their common sense as soon as they bred I'll never know. But I do know that their behavior, combined with their passive aggressive guilt-tripping, is starting to tear apart our once close family :(

I actually meant what I was saying.  I keep this friendship with a few girls for several years.  It wasn't until I was 18 when I got a call from one of their parents informing me that one of them had committed suicide.  I was shocked and stunned naturally.  What came next, was even worse.  The family asked if they could pay for me to fly down, speak at her funeral and meet them because in her goodbye note she left a message saying how I meant the world to her, she printed off our conversations, said how I helped during dark times etc.

I hung up.  I couldn't believe it.  They called a few more times and finally my mom spoke to her mom.  I made up a lie saying she was from grade school and we kept in touch.  They forced me to go, and I went.  It was weird..but at the same time like a part of me was always there.  It was a nice experience, if not soul destroying.

Finally got the balls to sit down and type this out. Considered using a throwaway, but what the fuck. I apologize for any spelling errors in advance.

Ever since I was around four my sister has had serious issues. She was seven going on  sixteen. She would scream that she hated my parents. She would break rules and get sent to her room, where she would cry.

Sometimes she would pack up a bag and claim she was going to run away. But that wasn't the worst. She would open the bathroom window and claim to jump out. She would stare through the open window at the ground screaming that she would do it. I was four, I thought she actually would. This crushed my heart. The thought of losing a sibling was too much for my young heart to handle.

This continued for years. We knew she had problems but at this time she refused to get help. She fell in to a bit of a ditch. We lived in a suburb of Chicago that is known for having, well, not the best people.

One day me and my dad were out (I was about 12 at the time) he was getting a new bike and we were stopping to eat at Wendy's. My dad got a call. I remember him saying ""Well you can suspect it but until you have evidence you can't really say anything."" She had been caught smoking weed. My parents raided her room and took anything they could, her screaming all the while.

Fast forward a few more years. It's the summer in which we move to Virginia. So my sister is still getting in trouble. One morning my other sister wakes me up and tells me we're going to my favorite place to get breakfast, the pancake house. I am happy and say ""Well lets wake everyone up."" She tells me no, just me and her. Not my bad sister or my parents.

We get there and she explains to me that my sister is getting sent to a camp in the wilderness where she will hopefully learn to get over herself. I realize that we went because there would probably be screaming and yelling while my sister was told.

We move to Virginia and live happily with her, my other sister now at college. My sister is getting therapy in Virginia, and all is well. Until one day my parents tell me that my sister is anorexic. So they send her to the most expensive treatment center on the east coast. She stays there a few months and whenever we come visit here she doesn't want to talk much.

She finally comes back and a few months later, at about three in the morning, my sister (the good one) calls our house frantically saying to wake up my sister now. Apparently she had posted something on twitter ""This is all over finally, the end of the line has come"" something like that. We wake her up and take her to the hospital to make sure she hasn't done anything to kill herself. The only thing they found was a burn mark on her arm, as well as what must be hundreds of scars from cutting herself, but nothing lethal.

Since then nothing too bad has happened but it seems like every once in a while, she comes through and ruins all of our lives. She does things that my parents fix by putting her places so expensive, that they have to take money out of their retirement fund. She is blind to what she has done and is doing to us.

I presume I stopped loving her the moment she was sent to the wilderness. I no longer love her and I accept that. She consumes my life with bad and makes it harder for me to live happily. I figured if I didn't have any feelings towards her then I wouldn't be consumed when she does these terrible things.

Sorry for the wall of text but thanks for listening to me. I really do appreciate it.

We lost our virginity to one another. The crazy thing is, it was *incredible* sex. We had no clue what we were doing, but it didn't matter. It was so hot. Then one morning we both panicked, my brother said he wasn't gay, and we agreed to never let it happen again. We both buried the thought, and moved on. 

We are now 24, and nothing has happened since. But the confession is, I want it to. I know it's fucked up and it's wrong, but I also know that given the chance, I wouldn't say no. To make matters worse, we are closer now than ever, and spend most of our spare time together (we never did stuff together when we were teenagers, except, well, fucking). Our relationship is completely awesome. But I think I'm in love with him and I'm scared I'm going to let it show and fuck up the most important relationship I have. I get physically sick when he talks about this girl he works with. I know he likes her and I want him to be happy, but I can't stand the thought of him with anyone else. 

I am so fucked up.

*EDIT: Alright, so I got a text earlier today from my twin that said something about the girl at work. I took a deep breath and responded with, ""I think you should ask her out."" A few minutes later, I got another one: ""Thanks for the advice. We're going out tomorrow night. :)""*

I was a nerdy chubby guy, so my self esteem was low when I started dating this girl, she was pretty and seemed cool. Actually though she was incredibly mean. She would constantly treat me like shit, making fun of the way I looked, the stuff I liked. I just stayed with her because I didn't think I could get anyone else, if I felt like shit before and then I finally get in a relationship  that confirms it then it's not really suspicion anymore I am just an ugly fucking loser. 

There was times were we would be normal, I liked doing romantic things, buying flowers etc. but whenever there would be anything that wasn't to here benefit she would start throwing punches like an animal, which would lead to me running into the toilet and locking the door until she calmed down. I caught me once and gave me black eye though and another time she smashed a glass into my face that's at the end of the post though.

The emotional stuff was the worst though, I just so badly want to be loved and to be able to share things with another person. Not to sound like an asshole but I feel I have a lot of love in me and just want to share it with another person, so when we would talk and share things anything I told her about myself that I was worried or insecure about she would always use it when she decided she was going to shout at me, example my hair is beginning to recede, I shared how deathly insecure I was about it, a week later I bought pepsi instead of cokacola ""YOU BALD FUCKER CANT YOU DO BASIC SHIT"" I basically hated myself.

I began running and going the gym, got in shape, not ripped but felling better about myself. We were supposed to be going to her friends BBQ, I had a work thing I had to go too. She does her things shouting screaming, insults, throws some punches, then she picks up a glass and throws it into my head and it shatters. She panics ""I'm sorry I didn't mean it"" we go the hospital. When we get home I tell her to get out of my apartment we're broken up and how much I hate her, how she's the most vile person I'd ever met etc. She runs out crying, the wah wahs are like music to my ears, worst fucking 20 months of my life.

AMA.",209,57,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18izia/i_29f_have_used_sex_to_get_out_of_being_arrested/,"Before judging me please know from the outset that I am not proud of any of this and that I have not engaged in any of this type of behavior in over four years and don't plan on ever doing it again.

The first time I used sex to save my ass was in highschool. I was failing Algebra/Trig my senior year and without the credit I wouldn't be able to graduate on time. It was the teacher who approached me that time. 

The second time I was the one who made the offer. In college I was completely in over my head in a certain course but the TA was friendly with me. With the final coming up and knowing I was going to bomb it I asked him one day if there was anything I could do for some extra credit to make sure I at least got some kind of passing grade. He did not get the hint at first but eventually I just flat out told him that I would sleep with him if he made sure I passed. He accepted.

I partied way too much in college. I had a bad fake ID and got into bars I shouldn't have been allowed into but it was sort of an open secret at several of the campus bars that so long as you any form of ID, and were an attractive woman, the bouncers would pretend that they actually believed you were 21. So I went out to bars a lot. One night I tried the ID at a club I'd never been to before and the bouncer took one look at it and put it in his pocket and told me to get lost. I was so outraged that I demanded he give it back and let me in. I was already drunk at this point having come from another bar. He told me if I didn't calm down he would call the cops. I thought he was bluffing. He wasn't. When the cop showed up he placed me under arrest. During the drive to the station I drunkenly offered to suck him off if he let me go. He agreed.

As for the job? That's the worst one. I'd only been working there six months but it was my dream job. I loved it. And one day out of nowhere we were told that our office was being closed and that only 20% of us would be retained and moved to new offices. All of us who wanted to stay with the company had to re-apply. Since I had basically no senority I knew I had probably no chance. So during my interview I made it clear to the HR rep that I really wanted the job. As in, I *really* wanted to keep my job. He got the hint and I ended up having a six month long affair with him as a result and even got promoted. I still work there and have been promoted twice since but I promise those promotions were based on actual merit.

For such a long time I used sex to get what I wanted. These are just the biggest examples. I finally stopped behaving this way four years ago when I was about to tell my boyfriend's friend that I would have sex with him if he gave me some concert tickets I really wanted. For some reason that was the first time I realized how insane and amoral I was being.

Again I am not proud of any of this. Yes, when I was younger I used to brag about some of it to certain friends but I was a stupid kid. Inside I always knew that what I was doing was wrong. But no, that never stopped me. Not until I grew up a bit and realized how insanely idiotic I was being.

I on the other hand had a mother I would like to call a ""runner"", we never stayed in state for more than 6 months, and I have a dad that just didn't give a shit. Because of this my cousin was and is my best friend. At her house we shared a room and bed. At night we pretended like we were sleeping and gradually scoot closer to each other. Then we would hold hands and that led to us rubbing each others stomach and breast (really just my breast, she didn't have them yet). That soon led to us kissing and fingering each other. Finally, and I don't know how we knew to do this, but we would wind up scissor fucking. It was pretty awesome. All in all it only lasted about a year and over time I guess we just forgot about it.

It's been one of the best decision I've ever made. I don't regret it one bit and I'm happier than I've been most of my life *until now*. I was the guinea pig in the family. My mother was also considering the surgery. I was the test subject. She wanted to see first hand what it would be like before she decided for herself. She finally had the surgery herself on October 22nd. 

**I can't handle her anymore.** I feel like the worst person in the world but I really can't deal with her anymore. I know the surgery is hard, painful, and turns your life upside down. I know this. I'm really trying to be supportive. But all she does is whine and complain. She wants the surgery reversed. She didn't know it would be like this. FUCK HER. I gave her a year of play by play updates of my experience. I told her everything I was going through emotionally and physically. She makes me want to punch her. I went through all of the changes and upheavals by *myself*. I never wanted to burden anyone with my issues. So I dealt with them myself. I saw a therapist, talked to my doctors and nutritionist, and did a lot of self introspection. I also had friends I talked to occasionally about it but no one that was always there for every little problem. Yes, I could have asked for more support if I wanted. I'm not like that though.

Right now, I'm personally going through a lot of my own issues I need to sort out. Depression, finding a job, school, etc. **I don't have the emotional energy to be her rock**. I'm sorry but I don't. I know she wants me there because I went through it and I know how she feels. But that's what support group is for and the online support pages. I can't give anymore of myself.

I feel like the worst daughter ever because she's struggling right now. She's still healing, upset, and a bit lost. I've been avoiding her though. I even have my aunt texting me about whether or not I've heard from my own mother. But I *can't* do it. She knows how bad off I am myself at the moment. I'm just so angry with her for demanding all of my time when I'm working so hard to get my own life on track that has barely begun.

TL;DR: My mother had gastric bypass surgery a year after I did and I'm basically ignoring her and refusing to help her through it. AMA.

edit: I actually talked with my mother today after posting and getting feedback from the wonderful people here. I told her that it's very emotionally overwhelming to be leaned on right now. I told her I would listen but I'm not going to be able to help her work through the things she needs to. That is really all self realization that will come in time. She needs to find it herself. I explained that it's hard for me to be there every step of the way because it feels like I'm going through all of the work again myself. Which is crushing because I fought my way to where I am. It's terrible feeling like you're at square one. But, I told her I'm going to try to be there. As long as she actually listens to me when I give her advice. I've been there and done that. It's like she forgets some times.

She seemed to understand what I was saying but she seems to be repeating the same behavior anyway. *sighs* Well, time will tell.

My really good friend was about to go to Korea (military) in like 48 hours, so even though it was late we went into the city to drink. On the way in we met up with a girl he sort of knows. After a few hours at a bar, he decides that since it's his last night out in the US, he's gonna buy a room at the Ritz. 30minutes and $324 dollars later, we're chilling in the most luxurious hotel room any of us have ever been in. 

He goes out with the girl for a smoke, and when they come back they're making out so loudly that I wake up (Fell asleep, Ritz matresses are very comfortable). Anyway, they're trying to be discreet, so they went into the bathroom, but the bathroom is enormous, so all the noises are just getting amplified. I'm kind of drunk and half asleep, so I decide that the best thing to do is just up and leave. Leaving without saying anything is kind of a bad option, especially at 4am in the middle of DC with a dead phone, but if you imagine yourself in my position it kind of makes sense.

Anyway, I start walking down 16th street towards the part of DC where the monuments and stuff are. There are many offices on 16th street, and many of them have large packets of newspapers that had already been delivered, even though it was very early. I like to read, and on rare drunken occasions, I like to steal dumb things. One of the packets I walked by had big  'FT' across the front. For all you unsophisticated motherfuckers, The Financial Times is highbrow 1%er shit - so I pick up this big bag with that and a few other newspapers in it, and just keep walking. Nobody is out except cops, but there are quite a few of them, so I'm wary. When a cop is on my left, I move the bag to my right, and vis-versa. 

After a while I get to the whitehouse. During the day, I just notice all the tourists. But in the early morning, there aren't any. You can see the lights on in certain rooms of the whitehouse and it's just  blowing my mind that the Obamas might be in there. I decide I want to get a better look near the railing, so I drop my stolen contraband, because there are 2 cop cars parked near the fence. About a second after the *thud* of my bag hitting the ground, I hear a car door open behind me. Fuck! Caught by the fuzz!

""Everything good, son?""

""Yeah, just sight seeing."" *(at 4am)*

""You wanna pick up your package?""

""Oh yeah - my package  - it's not a bomb **(IT'S NOT A BOMB!)** - just stolen newspapers. You're not gonna arrest me are you? Are you a cop?""


""Secret Sevice. You wanna pick up your package and get out of here?""

""Yes sir!""


10 minutes later, while walking down The Mall. *My arm is tired* Drop newspapers. Total words read: zero

This story is kind of stupid, but the news here keeps talking about how the whitehouse is in **super**  security mode right now. Probably inevitable after Boston, but I can't help but feel like I'm a little accountable.

There's no bathroom down there. I woke up early from a night of drinking and had to go so bad that I held the opening of a hard plastic cup (like the ones from typical restaurants) up against my goods, slightly bent my legs as not to drip on the floor, then left the cup on the ground. Later I just pour it down the sink or toilet....whatever. 

It became so routine that some nights i'd do it 2-3 times as my laziness increased. I started hiding the cups until one day my mom found one, held it up to her nose, and took a big whiff. ""What the hell is in this cup? Vodka mixed with something? You need to go dump this out, stop leaving cups down here!"" 

I still did it but would immediately empty as soon as I got up. I eventually stopped drinking out of the cups in the kitchen. Even though they went through the dishwasher, I couldn't tell which ones I had urinated in which grossed me out. 

When I moved back into my college dorm room I really had no reason to do this. Plus I had no big hard plastic cups. I have no room mate, but share my bathroom with two other girls. During the first week I woke up and had to go badly but someone was in the bathroom taking a shower. I went in a red solo cup, threw it in a trash bag and took it to the trash room. This became more frequent in the middle of the night. I then started collecting cups from the cafeteria just like the ones at home and made them 'The Pee Cups'. I started my routine again, then the next morning I dump it in the sink and spray my cup(s) with bleach cleaner. 

I have noticed I enjoy doing it because when I clench the cup in between my legs and squat it flexes my groin muscles which stimulates pleasure in my clitoris. It also just feels good to pee... for me anyways. I also love to let it go in the shower and pools.

But honestly, if one of them wanted to fuck, I don't know that I would say no. There has been at least once with each of the following three women that I was fucking you and thinking about fucking them.

Friend 1: Let's call her Mary. Mary is fucking ridiculously hot, and is super cool. Also, *she thinks star trek and battlestar galactica are cool.* I had previously assumed such a woman did not exist, and yet here she is scoring about 9.9/10, trophy wife material hotness I'm talking here, and weighing it at what must be a decently heavy, perfectly sculpted D-cup, and talking to me about what she thinks *really* happened to Starbuck. Her tits are so perfect I have to stop myself from reaching out and squeezing them half the time I see her. She walks around her house in that tiny little robe in front of us when we are over there. If neither one of you is looking at me, you better believe I'm staring down that shirt. Really. Those tits are that exquisite. Tits like this I did not think existed. Did I also mention she has a flawlessly body besides the 110% perfect tits? I feel like, if I cheated on you with her, and then died in her erotic majesty, they would be going over my sins in the big book of life, and they would see that one, and God wouldn't even get mad about it. St. Peter would call all the other saints and angels over and point it out, right there, Tigolebizzy managed to fuck Mary. They would all be like, ""Nice."" Then Jesus would give me a pound.

Then you have your other friend Trish (not her real name.) Trish's face is okay. She is an oddly shaped woman because she is normal height and size, except she is walking around with a massive pair of natural K-cups sticking out of her chest. I don't even know what size they are, I know she told us once, but it was some letter that I didn't know they made bras that big. They're fucking huge and awesome. This is another of your friends that seems to have no qualms about walking around in front of me in a short bathrobe. I think she might do this on purpose sometimes. I try my best to sneak a peak whenever she wears something low cut, and I have gotten very close to seeing the nip. I'm still working on it. I feel there is some sexual tension between her and me, so the prospect of something actually happening between us makes me feel even more guilty, yet makes me want to push the boundaries even more. What is worse, is I think I am the only person in our circle of friends who has not seen them in their full glory. This sexual tension is possibly brought on by the fact when she and I first met, I drunkenly told her and her boyfriend how badly I wanted to fuck her and that if it were not for her boyfriend being my good friend, I would have made every effort short of rape to do so. Somehow they both took these comments positively. Go figure. 

Then you have your other friend, lets call her Amy. Amy is not that hot but she has huge tits, cup size somewhere in between the first two. I can't really tell how big they are cause she is kind of nerdish bi-chick who seems mostly to be a lesbian and never wears anything very revealing, unlike the above two. She is cool as fuck though. Once she told me that in passing how she liked to walk around with cum in her hair after giving a blowjob. She could possibly have been trolling me because she does that, which makes her even more cool. Probably nothing will ever happen here cause of her girlfriend that I would seriously be afraid of beating me up. Still.

A guy came in and head-butted a woman who runs the place and she's in her 50's (for what reason, I may be in the dark of). He took her to the corner and started yelling and being physical. After that point, it didn't matter to me. I knew I had to do something. I was the only other male in the bar besides him and I kicked off my flip flops to prepare for whatever may come, I was already expected a punch at any time. 

I went for a full nelson and wrenched in on him. I weigh maybe 165 and I'm in my late 20's. This guy is in his 30's or past that and had least 50 lbs on me. I've never put a full nelson on anyone with shoulders that size. He went to slam my back against the wall,  I put my foot against it, then did a spin move to throw him on the tile floor, and fell on my back myself. My ribs made a noise and so did the back of his head. I popped up faster then he did with fists ready and said ""I don't wanna hit you!"" and he fled.

He wasn't at the bar all night, but it turns out, the woman he assaulted was the mom of someone he was seeing.

I'm digressing, maybe. This was the first time in a long time I've been in a physical altercation. I feel that I keep good company around and I like to be good company myself for good reason. 

It's been about 3 hours since that happened I'm still excited and don't want to sleep. Yes, testosterone. Yes, adrenaline. I didn't do this to be a hero. I just....there's no words. I took tae-kwon-do from a neighbor that had a studio down the road when I was growing up and I loved it. I moved about the time I was ready for a red belt but I always felt that respect and decency came first.

Yes this somewhat of a rant, I'm just having trouble sleeping now. This matter tonight has me questioning if maybe I should get back into martial arts, kickboxing etc. I'm not one for ""being in the gym"" but I loved the training and getting a workout in the process. Also, I'm kinda answering my own questions typing this. I'm glad I was there to stand up for someone tonight who was being mauled by a ""man"" and did something about it.

I am not gay. I am in high school. I just find that some girls make good friends, but they don't believe I really want to be ""just friends"" unless I say I am gay. So I tell them I secretly am. I don't have any interest in these people other than friends, I feel bad for supporting a stereotype and in some ways betraying my own gender, but honestly I just want to be able to hang out with a few people outside of my small circle that happen to be a different gender. Its stupid that they judge me so heavily for my sexual preference, but other than that they are pretty cool. Not sure if this makes me a creep, or an asshole, or what, but I am pretty sure if they found out they would hate me. 

More details from the first comment I posted:

""Well I guess I should have elaborated. I used to have one of their friends as a girlfriend. They think that I think that I think I am gay, but I am not sure. It isn't hard to back out of. Also, I made it sound like its super secret, so nobody else knows, and if it gets out it will be considered just a rumor. Also, my best friend, who is in the group I think knows the truth, and understands the general idea. Her mom now thinks I am the best thing that has ever happened, while a year ago she thought I was not to be trusted. As for the other girls, they really do things as a big blob, so if one of them does not like me I can't hang out or even talk to one of them. I do agree it is not the best situation to be in, but I think that I also could have worded this post better, I don't think its that dramatic.""",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1373805291.0,,,True,t3_1i8zzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i8zzc/i_tell_girls_i_am_gay_so_they_will_trust_me_as_a/,

Born and raised in the US to moderately-conservative parents. They had an active social circle of other Indian immigrants so I grew up around kids who were of the same background as me. I've really started to hate them for bad traits that I don't find in any other ethnic group.

They're attention whores and pretend to be model people when they have just as many problems as everyone else. Most of them are gunning for medical school and need to shove that fact down everyone's throat via constant status updates and faux-excitement over student groups, medical related things on campus, etc. They feel the need to shout to the world constantly about how their family and parents are the greatest ever. I love my family too but I don't make a habit of spamming my Facebook every time my dad or mom has a birthday and I just absolutely need to tell everyone about it.

Indian girls especially are shallow and materialistic. They pretend to be religious because it's what daddy and mommy want, but they don't know shit about Hinduism nor do they care to educate themselves on it. They hide their relationships from the world because they're afraid their parents will get angry on it; that's how little they respect their SOs, they're willing to lie to people and pretend their SOs don't exist.

Most Indian-Americans kids have no interests other than whatever field their parents have chosen for them, or India. That's it. India and medicine. India and engineering. India and finance. Not to mention that their conception of ""India"" is a dichotomy. It's either a magical, fragile and perfumed land of exotic food and colorful dresses **or** a poverty-stricken place that serves only as a way for them to go there two weeks every summer on a ""medical mission"" and point to that as a reason for wanting to be a doctor.

All of this just makes me frustrated. I know other groups may have this problem too but it seems that Indian-americans do it the worst.

And I can't say any of this in real life because it'll automatically make me lose half the people I know, and cause me to become a social pariah.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_1h6rhs,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1h6rhs/im_an_indianamerican_guy_who_cant_stand_other/,

N: I got your letter.

Me: And?

N: I did and that's beside the point. You fucked me over and you think a mix tape is going to fix it?  

Me: I'm SO sorry Nicky. I just want to see you again. I want you to look into my face and see how sorry I am. I'll do anything to make it up to you. 

N: Why now, after all this time? Get bored playing runaway? 

Me: I came back because I love you. I never stopped. Please, I just want to talk. I never left because of you. If you want to throw me out on the sidewalk on my face when you see me, I won't stop you. 

**[Long pause here. Had to have been like, fifteen minutes. I almost thought he was going to stop texting me at this point.]**

N: How can I turn down an offer like that? You're coming this weekend?

Me: I was planning on driving over early Friday morning. I won't get there until after midnight. Maybe early Saturday morning. I might have to stop and take a nap, it's a long way.

N: Come see me when you get here then. Text me before you head over. I'm serious though Tobias, I'm fucking furious at you right now. You don't even know.

Me: I know I love you. 

N: That's the only reason we are even having this conversation. 

Me: Do you still love me? 

N: I'm still thinking about it. I don't know how I feel right now. We'll talk Saturday.

Back then, Limewire and Frostwire were full of child pornography. I was a kid, they were kids. I didn't see anything wrong with it. Didn't know it was illegal. 

But as the years grew on, it became worse. You see, by that point I was already into just about every type of pornography you could bring to my attention. Gay, straight, bestiality, all of it. It was sick and twisted, all of it. 

I saw other boys and girls as nothing more than pieces of meat. I recognized no one as another human being. 

When I was 12, stuff happened between myself and an 8 year old girl. Her parents found out, and I was in a world of trouble the likes of which none of you could hope to imagine. I had done it to my sister too. 

I always expected her to one day spill her guts, and then I'd be hauled away and institutionalized. Nothing ever happened. The other girl's parents settled for an apology. There was no penetration. I had kissed her on the lips and felt around in her pants. 

I didn't know what I was doing, I was a kid. 

Then again, I wasn't your average 12 year old boy. 

There were parts of my being that were lightyears ahead of others my age, and other parts that were years behind. Developmentally advanced and disabled at the same time. It messed with your head. In part, I blame the ADHD meds for making me so 'out of my head' all the time. Ritalin, Adderall, Zoloft, all that stuff was pumped in constantly. 

Back then, schools could threaten to kick you out if your parents didn't medicate you. 

After that happened, I made a promise to myself. 

I couldn't hurt anyone else. But I didn't see a way to stop myself. I eventually ended up deciding that if I ever started entering the pattern of behavior again, I'd end my life to avoid hurting someone else. 

But that day never came. I found ways to disguise it and keep it under wraps. 

But one day, the FBI shows up at my school. They say there was a red flag that popped up. They had detected that someone's laptop was involved in something illegal.

I hadn't downloaded anything for months(by that time, Limewire was done and Frostwire was heavily monitored). I had no images on my computer. 

I went to school with drug addicts and dealers, so I suspected that one of them had done something online. But when they ran EnCase on my laptop, they found everything. 

I thought I would never see the light of day as a free man(boy) again. 

But they just wiped my hard drive, packed up, and left. 

To this day, I don't know what happened. They had me dead to rights. 

I don't want to argue the next part. This is what ended up happening: my friends introduced me to a man named Jesus, and my desires and sick nature have completely disappeared. 

I'm a free man, and no longer bound to my past. No longer bound to that terrible crap. 

This is not me evangelizing, this is my story of how I conquered my hell on earth. 

I am a free man.

Need advice from escort-knowledgeable people",198,49,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1585gk/last_night_i_had_a_horrible_experience_with_an/,"So we were at a hotel, and as a Christmas present I tried to hire this girl from the Internets to give him (and me, but mostly him) an erotic massage. I was told it would be $350 for both of us, full participation (whatever that means) and also because the hotel was far outside the city. She showed up and pretty immediately I knew, as Gob would say, ""I've made a huge mistake."" She was 1) NOT attractive and 2) a total bitch to my husband, who was a little drunk but really not doing anything bad (and trust me, I'm the first to tell him when he's being a drunk jerk). I could have gone with it if it was either 1 OR 2, but with both of those, I just immediately regretted it and wanted to get rid of her. She said the ""cancellation fee"" would be TWICE the $350! And you might say, well then just keep her to save the money, but apparently the $350 was just some sort of base fee and she was going to charge all sorts of ""tips"" for whatever services were actually rendered. Ugh. I feel so naive and idiotic. She called in this other woman that was there with them; they just started making a ridiculous loud scene, yelling at my husband and I was just crying and panicking and saying I didn't have any more money; I gave them $60 more just trying to get them to go away. My husband called security and I was just so panicked, I couldn't believe this ridiculous reality show scenario was happening to us. We've been to strip clubs and couples clubs, but never had anyone to a room. Anyway, security came and basically said ""it's his room, he wants you two to go, you have to go"" and they went. And I chased after them trying to give them more money because I was so worried, they have my full name...no credit card or anything like that, but they can look up my address with one click (I tried it) and I'm so worried about our family and jobs... ugh. I just feel so, so stupid having done this. Anyway, they were all ""no, no the agency will bill him, don't worry, you're fine"" (they were never actually mean to me, just my husband). My husband says there is no agency, it's just them, he's not paying any more money since we already gave them $400 for doing absolutely nothing, and he thinks nothing will come of it and they have no leg to stand on with anything. 
So. Don't tell me not to do this again or that I'm stupid because I am WELL aware of that. But here are my questions:
1) Is it likely we will hear from them or their shifty horrible friends ever?
2) Do they have any leg to stand on saying we owe them more money? (They kept saying ""The ad says 'cancellation fee may be up to double the donation.'"")
I'm just so worried about my job and my son... and them knowing my address.

My therapist is competent and professional.   I really respect my therapist, which is really good because I am often not easy to impress.  I think my therapist is smart and wise, and I don't think that many people are smart or wise.

And my therapist is HOT.  Oh, man.   She is a 6-foot-tall skinny blonde who dresses amazingly. Great smile. Really elegant. AND she's paid to be nice and sympathetic and listen to all my problems.

I think I have a lot of interesting things to say, and I often refer to relevant papers, books, films, etc., that she seems interested in hearing more about.

Not exactly lady-killing material...

I know there's no chance of anything ever happening.  Believe me, I have no intention of ""doing anything about this.""  Besides, I'd have to find a new therapist!

Or I could stand behind her desk while she makes phone calls and let my fingers explore her thighs, up to and around and inside her thong.  Then I could kneel under her desk and eat her out while ordering her to find her favorite porn video on the internet and narrate its action in loving detail...

We've been through a lot together, good and bad, and I would consider them my closest friends. However, there have been times when there's been a lot of tension in our friendship - in high school I was often the butt of jokes and pranks on their part...admittedly I was overly sensitive and not terribly socially adept - basically an easy target. We have had a lot of good times together too, though, and as we've gotten older I feel like we've usually been there for each other.

But last night I gained access to the email of one of these friends - he drunkenly admitted his password and I couldn't resist the temptation to look once I got home. I looked at the emails and chats between him and this other friend, and what I learned is that behind my back they relentlessly make fun of me, belittle me, and criticize not only me but my family. This is beyond just good-humored mocking and borders on pathological. And yet, I feel like I am not entirely undeserving...I have some serious issues...and after all, I am the kind of person that would snoop around in someone's email just to see what they said about me. I feel sick to my stomach and totally regret looking through his email...I would have rather remained (generally) ignorant than to be faced with this reality.

And I know the obvious advice is to cut them out of my life, but that is not so simple. We've been ""friends"" for so long and I do genuinely care about them, I don't want to cut ties, and certainly can't reveal that I've seen all this stuff.

When her mother was pregnant with him they knew that he would die shortly after his birth and she had the opportunity to abort but the family decided not to. Now, 20 years later, not a week goes by that my girlfriend doesn't mention him. There's even a mini-shrine to him in our bedroom. Every time that she's mentioned him I've tried to be patient and understanding about it but I find myself getting angrier and angrier about it. 

The worst part is that I know how much the loss of a sibling can shape your life because I'd lost my sister. 

My sister and I were raised by my single mother who worked 80 hour weeks to provide for us. As a result, my sister who was nine years older than me was my primary caregiver. She'd pick me up from school, take me to tutors, make meals for me, comfort me when I was sick or scared, just about everything a mom would do. A week before my 13th birthday she died. It really fucked me up for years to come but even now I don't really talk about her with anyone other than my mom. My girlfriend knows about her but not much more. When she mentions her brother it isn't in a manner that would be conducive to sharing our joint experiences, instead it is more in a ""poor, pitiful me,"" way. 

Now when she talks about him I fight the urge to roll my eyes and fake concern. The whole time she's talking about him I have fake arguments in my head about how she didn't even really know him, they knew he was going to die, how the hell can this be comparable to what I've gone through.

1370019544.0,139,self.confession,1few4s,I got a secret vasectomy.,235,96,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1few4s/i_got_a_secret_vasectomy/,"My wife and I met roughly 5 years ago, dated for 2 years and now have been married for the past 3 years.  We are both are in our mid 30s and when we met we were in much different economic situations.  I work at a very high paying job, enough to more than comfortably support an entire family by myself, while my wife worked a near dead end job as a low level secretary in a typical corporate setting.

When we decided to get married she was fairly adamant about quitting her job.  I had no problem with it as she seemed fairly unhappy with it.  The truth is is that my wife wants nothing more than to be a mother.  I also wanted a family, so I didn't mind that she quit her job because I expected that she would end up being a full time stay-at-home mom when we began having children.

About a year ago is when everything changed.  She got pregnant and we were both excited to have our first child.  However, at roughly the same time I found out about the pregnancy, I found out that she had secretly been having an affair with a co-worker from her old job for about the past 2 years through a chance discovery of a secret email account of hers.  I confronted her about the affair and she broke down and admitted everything but claimed that she had cut it off after suspecting she was pregnant.

The seed of doubt had been planted in my mind.  The question of whether this child was mine or this other mans was occupying my thoughts at every moment.  Trust is a huge issue for me and even the thought of her having another man's child was unbearable to me.  I debated leaving her, I thought about physically assaulting this other man, and I dreamed about things like slowly dosing her with Misoprostol in order to induce a miscarriage.  My mind went to dark places.

In the end, my calmer and more exacting self prevailed.  Since the discovery of the affair things between my wife and I were somewhat up in the air.  I had told her I needed some time to think about what I wanted to do.  She was obviously physically and mentally distraught, which may have contributed to the serendipitous miscarriage she ended up having due to natural causes.

At this point she was a broken women.  She knew that things between her and I were less than stable and on top of that she was a woman who wanted nothing more than to have children who had just lost her first child.  She was suffering.  I, on the other hand, actually felt good.  However, I still couldn't forgive her violation of my trust.  I knew I could never forgive.  I knew I could just divorce her, but I decided that was too easy and too quick for her.  She needed to suffer more in order to fulfill my need for vengeance.

At this point I formulated my plan of action.  I told her forgave her for her past infidelity.  I told her that I still loved her.  I told her whatever she needed to hear to make her think everything was alright.  Then I went on what I told her was a 10 day business trip.  Instead I went and got a vasectomy and relaxed in a hotel room.  I had decided that in order for her to pay her debt to me for what she had done I needed to take from her what she desired more than anything else: the ability to have a family.

At this point it has been a year since my vasectomy.  I have been tested multiple times and each time has confirmed I am ""shooting blanks.""  My wife thinks everything is normal between us and, in fact, seems to have been going out of her way to make me happy in what is probably her trying to make up for her past mistakes.  We have been having sex a lot as she chases that dream of getting pregnant again in order to have that family she wants so badly.  All the while I get the extra satisfaction of knowing that every time we do have sex that I am secretly denying her the chance of getting pregnant.

I figure at this point there are about 3 likely outcomes from my situation:

A) We will continue to try to get pregnant and remain unsuccessful until she is of the age of no longer being able to bear children.

B) She gets tired of not being able to get pregnant and decides to leave me.

C) She gets pregnant again in which case I know that the baby isn't mine.

In all 3 of these scenarios I have planned out roughly the same course of action I will take when the time comes.  I have slowly and steadily started organizing my finances to be as liquid as possible.  I have moved large sums of money into things like Bitcoin so that the money trail can be anonymous and untraceable.  If she gets pregnant, I will rapidly begin liquidating the rest of our assets and disappear without a trace the day she goes into labor.  If she stays with me and we make it into our mid 40s, I will consider that a success and I will also liquidate all the assets and disappear.  In the case that she decides to leave me, well then maybe I will throw her a bone for being smarter than I give her credit for, but who knows, maybe I will just disappear with everything in that case too.

I know I am a flawed man, but it is who I am and I don't think I can change.  Any way you look at it though, I will have my revenge.

(NSFW),182,42,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/14n6t8/i_lost_my_virginity_to_my_cousin_when_i_was_13/,"Ok...Here we go. I am sorry I'm using a throwaway, but my family would disown me if anyone saw this as I come from a Christian family. This is kinda graphic, and not a troll post. I am a christian(Or at least I try my best to be), but I do have troubles with temptation. One of those being my first cousin. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah is currently 13, and I am 15(male), but this started when we were 10 and 12. It started out one summer as just kissing, and when we were caught by our siblings we just stated we were ""Practicing for when we needed it"". We’d always make movies as kids, and her and I would always be husband/wife, boyfriend/girlfriend, yada yada yada. You get the picture, so it wasn’t really that big of a deal in our minds. 

Flash Forward to winter of 2010. She’s 11 and I’m 13. My cousins and I (Sarah, Me, My 9yo sister and 8yo cousin(boy)) are watching star wars together. Sarah and I were sitting next to each other (as always) and she snuggles up to me. I put my hand down by her waist and she doesn’t seem to mind. I ended up fingering her until she suddenly got up and sat somewhere else. Then things stopped between us. 

Come summer of 2011-We are at my cabin and we are doing roleplaying (as we always do) and I’m playing a criminal. I “kidnap” her and she kisses me in order to persuade me to let her go. Soon enough, games over and I’m fingering her. This time, she encouraged it, telling me how to do it or how fast/slow to do it. I’m getting into it, and then she gives me a handjob and I cum(for the first time). I didn’t know how to respond, and I thought I accidentally peed or something but she told me it happens when I’m happy(keep in mind, I’m from a sheltered christian family-I never got sex-ed until last year). Anyway, Sarah and I later that day filmed a short skit with our cousins that had the rough storyline of kids scaring their parents while they're asleep. Sarah thought it would be more realistic if she took off her shirt and bra(yes, she was wearing a bra at age 11-she was very developed at that age(and still is)). So I took of my shirt too and we just played the part of a couple cuddling in bed without shirts. We kept telling our younger cousins we needed to reshoot over and over again even though they did fine(I think you know why). 

Flash forward to december 2011. I was staying at her house for a week because my parents were off on some christmas missions trip. As you might have already guessed, roleplay is a usual activity in our group of cousins. Our cousins live on a huge plot of land, and have massive forests for us to explore. We were playing that my 10 year old boy cousin and I were soldiers hunting the locals to clear out room for camps. We were using neft guns and a blue star wars chewbacca gun that shot foam darts as well. My sister and Sarah used toy bows that my uncle made them last christmas. Anyway, Sarah was only wearing a cloth tied around her breasts and a skirt, no underwear.(this is important, as those skimpy clothes lead up to what happened later.) Anyway, I “captured” her after I “shot” her and I tied her to a tree. I got a boner from her skimpy outfit and I think she noticed. 

Anyway, after a long war (including dirt being thrown) we were all tired and decided to call it a night, as the sun was going down. I was still very horny (being 14) and wanted to play some more, as i was enjoying it. Sarah suggested that we all go shower up and then we can play another game. I cleaned up, put on loose pj pants and a tanktop and met up with the cousins. Sarah was only in a bathrobe. We decided we would essentially play house, where the younger cousins we the kids and we were the parents. Sarah told me she would put the kids to bed and would meet me in our bedroom. You can see the “kids” room from the “parents” room through a hall, and I saw her close the kids into bed and then she walked down the hall towards me. This scene is the most vivid, as this is when the “sexytimes” started. As she was walking I remember noting her smile, it was one I hadn’t seen her do before. As she walked towards the bedroom she untied her bathrobe and let it fall the the ground behind her. I remember the feeling of my penis swelling up with blood and how excited I was, as this was the first time I had seen a girl my age completely naked. I remember being confused that she had some pubic hair and also how bouncy her breasts were when she walked, I always thought they would just be stiff and unmoving. I had seen her breasts before when we were filming the movie, but we were both in a bed and she wasn’t walking. She closed the door and locked it and came over to me without saying anything. I remember being nervous that her parents would come up, as they were cooking christmas dinner downstairs. She came over to me and slid my pants down. I remember moving to help her, as my boner was making it a bit tricky. She then moved on top of me, one leg on each side of me, and brought my penis into her wet vagina. I was kinda nervous because I knew it was wrong, but hormones took over and I pulled her down and we got into a steady beat. The bed started making noises and I got nervous and said we should be quieter. She said that she wanted me to be on top. I told her I didn’t think that we should do it anymore because it didn’t feel right but she told me this is what parents do and I shouldn't  mess up the game. So I kept going. And we were kissing, sweating, bouncing, I could go into more detail but this isn’t a sex subreddit so I won’t. I came inside of her, and I just felt so weak. She came down and kissed me some more and we just kinda laid there, me inside of her and exhausted. My uncle came and knocked on the door and I got really nervous. He said dinner was ready, and we were going to open some presents. Sarah hopped right up and put on some pajamas and went out, telling me to come too. I said I’d be a minute and I went into the bathroom. I just kinda sat there and started crying for some reason. I felt sexually misunderstood and I didn’t know what to do next. I put some clothes on, washed my face off, and nervously went outside. I had that pit feeling in my stomach when you know you’ve done something wrong. I was worried my uncle would say something to me, but he seemed like he had no idea I just had sex with his daughter so I started to relax. We had christmas, all was fun, and everything seemed alright. 

Next day, we had went swimming. My aunt and uncle dropped us off and they went to some bar to get drunk or whatever. I went to the bathroom, stripped down, and hopped in the shower to get the chlorine out of my hair. After about 3 minutes, I heard the door open. The shower was steamy and I didn’t know who it was. I said “I’m in here!” and wiped a bit of the shower door so I could see through the steam who it was. Sarah was standing there, taking her bikini off and saying “I know, that why I came in.”. She came in the shower next to me, naked, and acted as if it was nothing. She said she’d put shampoo in my hair for me if I helped her too, and I agreed. It eventually went from washing each other with soap all around the body to fingering/handjobs to kissing and penetration. The shower was a bit cramped and the water was creating friction so we both came out and did it on the bathroom floor. She was moaning(parents were away) and that got me off so fast. After I finished I didn’t feel as famished as before, and I leaned over and just started making out with her. I then went on to lick her lady parts. Her pubic hair was sorta in the way, but I was horny and didn’t care. She came and I remember it tasted weird, but sorta good. I was worried she had a seizure or something because her whole body kinda shook but she said it was ok and that it was normal. 

Anyway, after that nothing big happened anymore and I went home with my parents. From then until June was a world of porn and masturbation for me. But being with her had kinda screwed with my sexual preferences. I went from normal porn to porn where girls had hair on their parts to incest porn all the way to looking on nudist forums to find pictures of underage girls that were her age. And even though I knew it was wrong and I knew it was sin, I still did it. My little guy pretty much took over. But every time I finished I went into a state of temporary depression because of what I was doing. June this year I saw her at a beach house we were all staying at (both families) and it was awkward at first. She seemed to be avoiding me and not talking to me. Come later the first night she suddenly opened up and said she wanted me to be her fashion designer. I said me being a 14 y/o boy, I had no fashion sense and had no idea what to do. She said “give me a moment to get ready, and all you have to do is pick out an outfit for me and put it on.”. She came out of the bathroom completely naked at this point, and showed me her suitcase full of clothes. I started with a leopard print pink bra and some panties. I was really horny and trying to control myself when I started fingering her as I was putting on her panties. She pushed my hand away and said “Nevermind, I’ll pick my own clothing.” And went into the bathroom and locked it. I felt like I had failed some sort of test or something. Anyway, as the week went on she became kinda loose with clothing around me. I kept myself under control, even when she came into my bed completely naked one night. But on the last day we are talking and she’s taking off her underwear and putting her bikini on while sitting on a chair. I catch a flash of her parts and kinda break. All my hormones, sexual confusion, everything just kidna goes away and I lose control. I pushed her against the chair, took off her clothing, and did her right then and there. She was saying no, but I kept going. It wasn’t until I came that I noticed the tears in her eyes. She ran upstairs and we didn’t talk for the rest of the trip. She went home, and we didn’t see each other again until this october. 

We went to a theme park and had a really nice time. She didn’t seem mad at me or anything, and as weird as this seems, she was still wishy washy with clothes around me. Coming into my hotel room with only her bathrobe on and untying it once she gets in, cuddling with me when I’m watching tv and even giving me handjobs. I didn’t give in though, because I made a rule for myself to not have sex with her after what happened in the summer. She didn’t seem mad or anything, just her normal flirty self, half naked and hot as always. 

This concludes my confession, and here I am, sexually confused and disappointed in myself for stooping so low as to have sex with my own cousin, 3 times. Millions of sperm have died because of her and I have lustful thought about her all the time. I know it’s wrong because we are blood related, and we never used protection and I think I am very lucky that nothing happened. But I think if we weren't related we’d be dating or something like that. Anyway, I’m seeing her again this December and I just finished talking to her on the phone. Her and I are fine now, but she is always hinting at sex and things like that, such as something that happening in our last convo-she was talking about how her jeans have a hole in the crotch area, and I asked if she was going to throw them away or fix them, and she just says”I might keep them for easy access for you”. It’s things like this that make me confused and I never know what her thoughts are. She always acts so flirty, but I don’t want to seem like I’m using her. I just don’t know what to do. Ask me anything, I’ll answer what I can. I’m sorry this is a bit long, but nobody knows about this other than her and me. 

I know, I’m screwed up.

EDIT: Ok I just realized a mistake in the title. We didn't start having sex until we were 14 and 12, my bad.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your words of encouragement, advice, and support. Honestly, reddit and my religion have been the only things keeping me going now and I'm glad I can trust you all.

She seemed okay, but said nothing.",270,132,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i5q9b/i_told_her_last_night_she_seemed_okay_but_said/,"I am a 47 year old man happily married to a 47 year old woman (who is out of my league in the looks department - if I'm being honest).  She's 5'5"" 120# with strawberry-blond shoulder length hair.  She has a modest breasts and a very flat stomach.  Her body is way better than most women her age.  Me (no one cares).  We've been married for 3 years (both on re-marriages).

My libido has been raging these last couple weeks (I'm not sure why).  I have been fantasizing (repeatedly) about watching my wife have sex with another man.  Being there.  Under her.  Right there.

Well, last night, I told her.  I told her I want to make it happen if she's okay with it.  I think that she's comfortable with the idea (perhaps even into it).

I pulled her on top of me (face to face).  I held her tight and low against me.  I positioned my erection against her abdomen with her pubis directly above my balls.  I was describing the fantasy in detail while making out, kissing and grinding the base of my erection against her.  I reached around and spread her ass in a way to expose her slit to the cool night air.  I whispered into her ear that I wanted to be under her, holding her pussy lips open while another man fucked her from behind (with me under her holding her ass cheeks open).  She said nothing but groaned and ground even harder against my dick.  I took this as a positive sign (at least she didn't freak out and run to the bathroom).  I wasn't actually touching her pussy (with my hands or dick), but I felt the warmth of her pussy juices flowing over my ball sack directly beneath her.  We had the upstairs sliding glass door open and the whole house fan on high (we often do this to drown out the sounds of our lovemaking to the kids in the house).  I knew her pussy was sloppy wet because the cool of the night air was evident on my pussy-juice soaked balls.

My wife doesn't say much (ever) during sex.  Kinda like fucking Helen Keller sometimes - which can be frustrating.  She makes noise - good... wonderful noise.  But she doesn't speak.  No ""ooh, yes that's good"" or ""fuck me harder"".  Just moans, and screams.  It's good.  But in terms of 'feedback', sometimes I feel like I'm driving blind.

After my confession to her about wanting to watch her fuck someone else and be right there with her, I added that I was ""fucking serious"".  I told her ""I want to make this happen.""  I confessed more details of my fantasy to her holding her in this position.  I even went so far as to say ""I want my tongue on your clit while he fucks you.""  Not once did she pull back, or give ANY indication of unease.  She seemed to grind harder (and my balls got wetter) the more I said.  I hope I didn't freak her out.

I specifically didn't want to write this like some sort of ""Dear Penthouse"" bullshit piece.  It's simply a confession that I made to my wife last night.  I'm not providing extra 'sex' details on purpose.  It's a confession not an /r/gonewildstories.

I'm socially well-rounded and known by friends and family for being a generally decent person. Despite this, I secretly crave things that are perverse and taboo. I never fully indulge in them, however, because I was born with empathy and raised to be a good person. Hence, the title of this post. My favorite movies involve psychopaths. I love watching and reading American Psycho and seeing how Patrick Bateman moves through normal society while committing murderous atrocities. I consider Hannibal Lechter and his psychopathy to be beautiful and kind of wish he weren't only a fictional character. Then, I get ashamed when I wonder what it would be like to be that naturally evil because, again, I was raised to abhor behavior like that. I'm a normal human being. And I absolutely hate that fact. 

I personally believe what people consider to be their mental illness is actually an extremely beneficial evolutionary trait. To be able to not feel emotion while still being able to fake having it in order to blend in with society sounds like a tremendous boon and I constantly wish I had the same trait. I'm familiar with the connection between business leaders and psychopaths and I believe it makes total sense. They don't allow emotions to impede on their personal success and that allows them to master whatever they want. I feel like my sense of empathy has held me back my entire life and has allowed people to treat me like a doormat. I would love nothing more than to shut down all of my emotions and grasp the life I know I was born to live. 

I understand that sociopaths get the short end of the stick because they aren't able to fake emotions like true psychopaths. They spend their entire lives being shunned by society because of an inherent wrongness in their personality. But they're still able to live without feeling emotions and, while I don't envy their lot in life, I'm still able to empathize with them (ironically enough) and consider them superior to normal human beings.

**edit:** Welp, after being on here for 14 hours I think it's about time to wrap things up. Much thanks to you guys. That goes to everyone from the people gave advice to the others who articulately tore me a new asshole. To the people who were actual psychopaths and sociopaths, I understand that your lives are hard but you're better than most of us. I wish you all the best in your endeavors. 

My feelings haven't changed but I do, eventually, plan to go to a therapist and learn to come to terms with not being able to be a psychopath or sociopath.

Eventually, he convinced my sis to get me to kiss and make out with her for fun. I didn't know why the fuck not so I went along with it. He was always getting us to do something in front of him and he loved it. During all this, he would give me porn to watch that he thought i would like. A lot of lesbian stuff, and really slutty stuff. I did get really into those. We slowly worked our way up to me sucking his dick, or licking it up after he cummed on my sister. Once or twice, he got us to eat each other out.

After months of this, they broke up and me and my sis totally stopped having a sexual relationship. That did pretty much set me on the path to having a lot of other sexual relationships though. I turned into quite a slut since then.

My sister and I were close for  a while but drifted apart eventually. Last summer (we're both in our 20s now), I randomly decided to go see her. I went to her apartment and found out she just broke up with her boyfriend of about a year and he was a real ass about it. I cried with her and hugged her and all that good sisterly shit. I kissed her on the cheek really hard and she perked up a bit and kissed me back. After a few seconds she said something like ""Remember what it was like when we were teenagers?"" I was like ""Yeah that was wild shit."" She smiled and said Wouldn't it be fun or something, and we kept kissing till we made it to each others mouth and everything changed right there. We were back. We started kissing and making out wildly, for at least 30 mins, before we got undressed. We ate each other's pussies on her living room couch. After an hour or two of kissing, making out, licking, sucking, eating, kissing, and cuddling, we started talking about all the fun we could have.

So the next Friday, we go to a bar, and bring a guy back to her place and the three of us go wild. The next night, we bring two guys. We've been doing shit like that for months and a few weeks ago I decided to move in with her. We've got so close, she doesn't feel like my sister at all, just a best friend. With benefits, I guess. Our sex life is staying really hot and we're having lots of fun. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be doing this but fuck, I just can't think of a reason why not. 

So there's my very fun and very screwed up life. What do you guys thing?",,False,,t5_2qo2a,True,,,True,t3_smipq,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/smipq/i_am_really_really_close_with_my_sister/,

This was the strangest night I've had in a long time, and I can't get it out of my head.",185,44,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1b5pc6/my_best_friends_mom_gave_me_a_blowjob_last_night/,"Hi.  I have felt shitty, dirty, and shameful all day.  I don't care if anyone reads this wall of text, but I have to get it out of my system.

Out of the blue, I texted my teenage best friend, who I've only seen once in the past year or two, to go out drinking last night (we're both in our late 20s now).  When we got back from the bars, his mom was still up and based on my friend, was probably on some sort of drugs.  There was an older man there with her in the living room - a slow man who I knew from my teenage years as the guy who attended every high school basketball game since the '60s or so for our city's main school.  My friend's mom met the guy when my friend used to play basketball for the team.  

My friend's mom was always a little crazy when we were growing up, but now she is apparently a depressed junkie; in my drunken buzz, I felt very empathetic toward her as I always viewed her as a second mom.  She was lying on the couch in the living room and I was sitting on the edge of the cushion running my fingers through her hair and trying to calm her down because she was in a really depressed mood.  

Suddenly, last night, I felt this sexual tension toward her that I'd never felt in my life.  I cannot even describe how it suddenly came over me. She eventually went to her bedroom to allow me to sleep on the couch, and I was talking to my friend and telling him I really wanted to help her out and was on the verge of tears seeing her this way.  He was telling me it was no use as she's always like this now and was basically telling me to give it up.  I went into her room and was holding her in my arms and talking to her (it feels so weird to type this, but it felt natural last night) and my friend came in there and said we were going to go stay at this girl's house that he's talking to instead.  

When we were in the car, I kept telling him I really wanted to go back to his mom's house to talk to her some more because she needed help.  He kept saying no because he didn't want to deal with her anymore that night and she was going to get on his nerves.  In hindsight, I wonder if he realized that I was really wanting to go back for the possibility of a sexual encounter, but wasn't going to bring it up in the open.  I feel like such a piece of shit.

We were at this girl's house for maybe 20 minutes tops and it was about 4 am at this point.  All I remember is a blurry scene of me loudly talking about how badly his mom looked, how I wouldn't feel comfortable sleeping at this girl's house, and finally persuaded him to drive us back over to his mom's house.  I couldn't focus on anything else.  When we got back and he was in the bathroom getting ready to go to bed, I met his mom in the living room.  She gave me a goodnight hug (she was always loving like that) and started talking depression again.  Out of nowhere, I was slowly kissing her on the lips.  When I heard the bathroom sink water running, we broke it off and she went into her room.  

I went into my friend's room to hang out a bit; when I finally went back into the living room to crash, she was in the hallway right outside of his room and I bumped into her in the dark.  I think she was waiting for me to come out of his room or something.  She rubbed my dick, and told me she had made the couch up.  I *knew* she was making excuses to stay up to mess around with me, but was also aware that my friend might have sensed something was up, so I was just saying thank you casually, goodnight, etc., while I was fondling her breasts.  

I got all settled on the couch and she kissed me goodnight on the lips and went back into her room. After lying there for a few minutes, I went into her dark room and started to fondle her again.  She said not to because that older guy was sitting in a chair by her bed (so weird).  She said he was ""just a friend"" and that he didn't sleep in the bed with her.  I went halfway back to the living room, then back to her room and whispered to come out because I needed to ask her something.  We stood in the hallway again, my playing with her boobs and her rubbing my dick through my pants.  

We both instinctively went back to the living room.  I was laying on the couch and she was on her knees on the floor beside it.  I was whispering to her that we really shouldn't go any further, but was guiding her hand toward my exposed penis at the same time.  We both agreed that we couldn't tell anybody about this and she implied that she wanted to have sex.  I said that would be too much, but she should just give me a blowjob instead.  She gave me one, going to town on my balls and shaft.  I remember apologizing that I hadn't showered since the previous morning (it was now about 5 am) and she told me I tasted/smelled fine.  It was so surreal watching the dim outline of her face and she had her mouth all over my genitals.  Eventually, I finished off in her mouth, we again agreed to never tell anybody about this (""You think it'd be bad if he found out?  Imagine how much worse it would reflect on me.  I'm his mom."")  

She went to her bedroom and I fell asleep on the couch.

My friend was up earlier than me and made some eggs and bacon.  I was briefly awoken by this, but by the time I fully woke up a few hours later, he was back asleep in his room.  I got up to leave, said by to him, and got the hell out of there.  

I have felt weird all day.  I still cannot believe it actually happened, and how shitty of a friend I am to parade into his life out of the blue and pressure him to go back with me to his mom's house with the underlying intent of doing something sexual with her.  I just feel dirty.  

If you managed to read all of this, thank you.  I couldn't keep this bottled up anymore.  

Edit: Also, she gave me a call earlier today thanking me for talking to her last night.  She said she has been very depressed and taking all sorts of pills lately and she felt a lot better today thanks to me.

I feel I should be but I'm really not. For example:

*  Urine. Sometimes when I'm peeing I'll pee a bit on my hand (and it's warm too) and smell it. Kind of smells like popcorn.

* Poo. This is probably my favourite.  Only a few times in my life have I shit and had it smell terrible to me. I usually really like the smell. I savour it while I'm pooing, then I get a close up smell of my toilet paper after I wipe. I feel disgusting every time I do it but now it's a habit and I don't even think about it. 

* Menstrual blood. Yes I'm a girl. For some reason period blood has such a ""whole"" smell? It is very rich almost? There's more depth to the smell than just the metallic smell of regular blood. I always smell my tampons. When I used to wear pads they smelled even better (maybe a mix of crotch sweat too? I'm not sure but the smell was INCREDIBLE). 


Maybe you're the same as me or maybe you're absolutely disgusted.  Maybe I can redeem myself by saying the  smells I don't like:

* TOE JAM. It is vile and sickly sweet smelling and makes me nauseated instantly.  

* Vomit.  It's probably the association with one of the worst things ever (puking) that makes me not like the smell. 

Anyway, I've been thinking about making this confession for a while.  I am going to add that I pick my boogers and eat them. Now that is all. Thanks :D

From a time when I was very young in my life, my mother would chew anything like a goddamn cow. The sound of her smacking her lips on just about anything haunts my dreams to this very day.

It's like the sound of the baby in Eraserhead. Anytime someone is eating, no matter how loud the environment is, I hear it far louder than nails on a chalkboard or screeching brakes on a Ford Crown Victoria. 

Every time I hear the sound I can't help but want to punch the person that's doing it square in the face. It's not like they might be able to not do such a thing while eating or even know I have such a disdain for this sound. It makes me feel like a real asshole every time it happens.

I understand I probably suffer from Misophonia (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) and honestly, it's not that big of a deal. I just wanted to spew this out on Reddit and hopefully get feed back from others who might experience the same thing.

Years ago my first girlfriend cheated on me, we were long distance. She had just gotten in shape and was getting all of this new attention from guys. She hooked up with someone one night and had the audacity to call me at 2 am crying because, ""she felt guilty."" I was weak and only got weaker. 

I then started dating another girl too soon after. She was a horrible person in disguise. She started the relationship by making us seem like a perfect fit. But over the months, she turned out to be a spoiled princess who was always right. She hated my family and through manipulation turned me against everyone. Ultimately, she found someone else and began a month long affair, which culminated with her calling me to break up with me the morning after our 9 month anniversary...oh and she had broken our date that night to sleep with the new guy. I found out later from a mutual friend what had been going on.

I slipped into an even greater depression. Then I picked myself up. I got into incredible shape. Not just casual, ""I go to the gym 3 times a week."" No I went everyday except my rest days (6 times a week) and kept a Spartan-like diet. In my mind I was a gift to women. I was intelligent, made good money, handsome, and in incredible shape.

Yet my insecurities have crippled me. My depression has become worse and worse. Every relationship since then has been a culmination of myself not being able to trust them. Usually ends up with them getting dumped. 

I hate cheaters. It's much like the hive mind here on Reddit. They all have had that ex that ruined them. I'm different. I don't just have that ex and contribute to the hive mind. I have a hatred in the purest sense of the word, for these people who cheat. I downvote them. I send them messages outline how much a piece-of-shit they are and genuinely do my best to let them know that what they did to that person, is not something to ""brag"" about on the internet. 

Why am I confessing this hatred and these actions? There was a post on AskMen about a women who had cheated, and as she acknowledges broke this mans heart. Yet, she missed him, still loved him and wanted to get back in contact with him. I could feel my face getting hot as I read this self righteous garbage. This women has no right to stick her nose back into that persons life. She is a selfish, evil woman, who deserves all the unhappiness she is feeling and much much more. 

TL/DR: I probably hate you for not just reading the text above.

Edit 1: A lot of comments about letting go of the hate. I have tried, although not successfully to let go. However, there comes a time where I will open myself up again and pay the price. There's more than just the two incidents up there that drives my hate. For the time being, I'm using it to push myself to be better. If only for myself.

Edit2: As is customary on Reddit, a lot of you have suggest seeking professional help. Instead of telling each and everyone of you in the comments: I do see someone. I have seen this person going on 5 years. He has seen me at my best and my lowest points. Forgot to add that I have sought help for the depression and have since been medicated...still feel the hate.

1357941386.0,136,self.confession,16ei42,I pretended to be a guy online and a woman moved half-way across the country to be with someone that didn’t exist because I was too scared to tell the truth.,170,34,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/16ei42/i_pretended_to_be_a_guy_online_and_a_woman_moved/,"I’ve never, ever told anyone this, and have never even written it down. Warning for a wall of text, sorry this is so long, I just have to get it out - the TL;DR is basically the title. 

From late 1999 to early 2001, I pretended to be a man online and had several women that I communicated with daily through email, nearly all of whom wanted to have a relationship with me. I created an entire backstory for this fake man, and I got so the backstory was so consistent that it seemed real, even to me. I found older women - in their late 40’s/50’s - through dating sites and just by contacting random strangers through instant messenger. I was never flirty with them, never sexual, nothing like that, but all of the women I emailed with were vulnerable in some way. A couple of them were unemployed and living with family, one of them was marginally employed but suffered from poor health, another was recently divorced, another was just looking for some sort of adventure in her life.

I liked the attention. I liked always having emails waiting for me. I liked it that I was someone these people admired. It eased my loneliness - at the time, I was a 14 year old high school student stuck in a new town in the middle of nowhere with no one to talk to. I didn’t like people my own age and had no real interest in the stuff teenagers are normally into. Like I said, it was never romantic - I’m a straight female - and on the few occasions that a woman would make it clear that she wanted a romantic relationship with me, I ended it. I told them at the time that I was only looking for friends, and that I thought women made better pen pals. I gave them some bullshit about women being easier to talk to, open to new ideas, etc, but really all it was was that I was afraid if I had a male pen pal, he’d eventually realize that he wasn’t talking to another man.

I would take stories from my own life or stories I had heard, spin them a little, and make them part of this man’s background. I planned out what college he’d gone to during what years, what towns he had lived in, what jobs he’d had, what countries he had traveled in, what businesses he had owned. I made details about his childhood, even right down to what the wallpaper in his childhood bedroom had looked like. I had an entire timeline of his life so that the story would be consistent from person to person, so that I would never be caught in my own lie. His life was a reflection of what I wanted my life to be at that age, and so I was sort of living through this character.

And it worked. People believed me. Like I said, I found some of these women through dating sites, but I had no intention of being romantic with them - whenever one of them contacted me through the dating site, I always had an excuse as to why I didn’t want a romantic online relationship (“The profile is sort of old, and I’m seeing someone right now” “I really want to get to know you first” etc). A few of them were surprisingly fine with just being friends. It’s just that dating sites are a good place to find people who were willing to open themselves up to another person - remember this was the early 2000’s, before there were a lot of pen pal sites.

I happily hid behind this persona online and eventually began instant-messaging every day with this one woman named Pat. Pat was going through a rough time in her life - she was deeply in debt, unemployed, living with her sister, whom she despised. There had been a domino effect of shitty happenstances that had occurred in her life over the course of a few years that had landed her in that position. Pat was in her early 50’s, and I got so that I really enjoyed talking with her. She was smart and funny and open to talking about all the new ideas that were fermenting in my teenaged head, which I pretended were coming from a 50-something dude who was undergoing an emotional awakening after a lifetime of emotional suppression. She didn’t have anything better to do and I, being a now 15 year old teenager on summer break in a town where I had no friends, didn’t have anything better to do either.

Pat lived in Minnesota, and I told her that I lived in southern Florida near the ocean. She loved hearing about what the ocean looked like that day (I knew how to access webcams of the ocean, she did not, so I would just tell her what the waves looked like), I even sent her some shells from a beach when I vacationed in FL late that summer so that the postal code stamp would be near where I had told her that I lived. I made up historical facts to tell her (which were completely false), I went through “relationship dramas” as this man that she advised me on, I told her of spiritual awakenings that I’d experienced, she told me things she said she’d never told anyone, etc. I found pictures online of a random nobody and sent those to her, claiming it was me. I found other pictures of a random house and sent those to her, claiming it was my home. We were good friends. It’s just that I wasn’t who she thought I was.

Pat very nearly caught me a few times, because sometimes she wouldn’t believe what I’d said and she would tell me she didn’t know if I was real. I always managed to smooth it over somehow. However, she wanted to talk to me on the phone and worse, she wanted to meet me. In fact, by the end, she insisted on it.

By that time, she had started working again and had some money. She also wanted out of her situation and to start over. I don’t know why I did this, but -- eventually we got to talking about her coming to live with me at an entirely fake address in southern Florida. We planned it all out meticulously and had “known” each other for a year. I even told her that I had a “friend” who was a business owner and would give her a job -- this was the only time I spoke to Pat on the phone, when I was pretending to be this “friend” with a business and I “interviewed” her for a job that didn’t exist in a small business that didn’t exist. She wanted to speak to me - the fake me - on the phone, and somehow I always managed to beg her off, telling her that my phone was broken (which was ridiculous, since most internet still ran off the phone line in those days) and that I would call her soon, soon, I promise, soon.

I would lay awake at night, telling myself that I had to tell Pat who I really was. This woman was about to uproot her entire life to be with someone who didn’t exist. But I felt like I was in too deep and a big part of me really believed this lady would connect the dots and wouldn’t really go through with it. I was also 15, and scared of getting in trouble (with who? I don't know).

The day came when she was going to fly from Minnesota to the airport near where I “lived” in southern Florida. We had one last instant messenger conversation, with her very excited about her new life and with me assuring her that I would see her in just a few hours, that I would be there to pick her up, I’d have a sign and balloons and everything. I gave her a made-up phone number to reach me with. I agreed that she could stay at my place for a few weeks until she got a couple of paychecks under her belt and she could find her own place. It was like I was watching a stranger typing those words to Pat, like I was on auto-pilot, like it wasn’t real.

She had told me that she had never taken this big of a chance, but that for once in her life, she wanted adventure - adventure like the kind I (or rather, my fake persona) had had in his life. She was tired of being scared of life and wanted to embrace it.

Those next several hours were torturous. I tried to act normal at home but it was impossible. Again, I really believed that she would wise up and call it off at the last minute. Unfortunately, she didn’t.

A day later, I get an absolutely irate email from Pat, demanding to know where I was. The phone number had connected her to a dry-cleaners. The business didn’t exist, according to the yellow pages. Three more emails came throughout the course of the next 36 hours. She was writing the email from a library and only had enough money to stay at a hotel another few nights and then she didn’t know what she was going to do since she didn’t have enough money to get back home. She said she had never taken a leap of faith in her entire life, and that she had trusted me because she just needed one person in the world who she could trust and who believed she was a worthwhile human being after all of the shit that had happened to her in the past few years. She berated herself for being an idiot, for being misled, for going with her heart instead of her brain.

It tore me up. Look, I realize that both she and I made mistakes, but it tore me the hell up to know that there was a lady out there somewhere - someone I considered a friend, despite everything - that was going through such turmoil, and that I had caused it.

Her last email was one last attempt to get in touch with me, pleading to please answer her. She must have realized by that time that I wasn’t real but was hoping I could somehow help her out anyway, but there was nothing I could do. I never answered. In fact, I shut down that entire email address and put that entire episode behind me. I don’t know what happened to her.

There were so many red flags she should have seen, the fact that I wouldn’t speak to her on the phone being the biggest. I think she was desperately looking for something in her life, and however temporarily, I managed to give it to her - maybe she just WANTED to believe and so she ignored her rational mind. But you know that episode of the Simpsons where Bart writes fake love letters to Mrs. Krabapple, who believes they are from a real guy? And how torn up Bart is when he realizes how upset and humiliated Mrs. K will be when she realizes she’s been duped? That’s how I felt - I let the whole thing go too far, and I must have really hurt and humiliated someone. I feel terrible about that. It wasn’t right, I shouldn’t have done it, no excuses, period.

Every time this memory pops into my head, I get that cold feeling of shame all throughout my body. I don’t even totally know why I did all this. Pat, wherever you are - I am sorry.

TL;DR: I pretended to be a guy online and a woman moved half-way across the country to be with someone that didn’t exist because I was too scared to tell the truth.

However, my lower jaw and lips were torn badly and the scars disfigured my face permanently. Plastic surgery was offered, but my family would have trouble affording it, so I made the difficult decision as a little boy to just leave it as it was, maybe fixing it one day when I could afford it on my own. The only other damage was to my left eye; not much, but it caused me to be far more sensitive to light for about two months.

Since my face had turned quite ugly, I took to wearing a bandana over my nose and mouth. As a little kid I thought it was pretty fun, and often pretended I was a cowboy, talking in a silly western accent and shooting my friends with my fingers. And of course, to keep bright lights out of my eyes, my father lent me an old wide-brimmed hat, which made for even more cowboy lines. Of course this got boring, and playing outside got difficult due to my light sensitivity.

Over time, I stopped talking to my friends. They all played sports, which I never had done anyway. I started to play more chess with my parents, cards with my sister, and eventually when we picked up a computer, minesweeper. I had nearly dropped out of contact with all of my friends, and I never really talked anymore. My parents switched me into homeschooling, and became very protective since my eye had never fully healed.

Fast forward to when I turned 12, all I really did was play games. Video games like Doom 2 on the PC, plenty of games on the NES, etc. I had learned to deal cards and play poker, which we did as a family just about every other night (playing for 'chore coupons'). I had a very lovely childhood, everything seemed to go well. But I NEVER went outside, and my skin was extremely pale, so one summer we went to the beach. My sister was very tan and blended in well with other kids, but I stood out like a sore thumb. With a black and white checkered bandana, people tend to stare at you. And this is where the fear of my face began.

Other kids started to gather around me and ask me to help with their sand castles, the usual beach stuff. I didn't say much, and only then realized how awkwardly tall I was. At the age of 13, I was about 5'10"". Combining that with my strange attire and pale skin, kids either were scared of me or drawn to me. While I was taught to play volleyball by my sister and her friends, one kid decided to tease me by taking my bandana and running off with it. Seeing my scarred face and jagged lips, the younger kids screamed and ran to their parents. All the others just stared at me, some giggling in the background. I just stood there shaking a bit while the bandana was returned to me by the little kid, his mother apologizing frantically to my angry parents. 

Needless to say, I never wanted to go to the beach again. My parents didn't bother trying to argue, my skin badly sunburnt and feelings hurt. For a while I even refused to expose my face at the dinner table, and tensions got high between my mother and father (he wanted to pay for the surgery, she wanted me to be who I was). I just silently listened to the rest of the world as I sat there, playing cards and video games for the next 5 years. 

I had taken I huge interest in gaming professionally, but I was never good enough. I tried writing, I wasn't good enough. I wanted to become a programmer, but I was never good at math. By age 18, looking for a career had become something I just didn't care about. So I stuck to loafing around and playing games, surfing the net, and reading books. My sister was in college studying to become a mathematician, and I was living at home getting skinnier, sicklier, and more depressed. My parents had gotten used to the way I lived, and didn't dispute it. They were too protective of me, and knew I would never accept the surgery without paying for it myself. I became depressed, and read that other teenagers would often cut themselves in order to vent their angst. I took to cutting myself under my bandana even more than I already was, since no one could see it and it would eventually all be fixed anyway. Over a couple of months, my jaw was covered in small cuts along with the large, permanent scars.

Over all of those years away from any lights other than a TV or monitor's glow, my eye had no chance to recover. I had driven myself into a very bad situation, which only laser eye surgery could fix. Eventually I had made enough money from my job as a stock boy to afford it on my own, and I had it fixed. Almost. The doctor said too much damage had been done over the years I ignored it, and I wouldn't ever be able to see very well in the light again. I became extremely angry at myself for being so stupid, and dedicated most of my time to working out in order to vent my frustrations. Unexpectedly, I did well, and managed to become very fit by the age of 19. I didn't do much with my newfound strength, but it certainly helped to clear my mind. I got inspiration from the internet and my cousin, while my parents watched their baby boy turn from a reclusive corpse into a successful psychology major. 

Now, as a 24 year old psychologist, I can look back on myself as a kid and understand myself. I studied this 'boring' profession because I wanted to know what revived my hope. Of course, some of the mental damage is irreversible, it seems. I developed an intense fear of letting my face be seen by anyone, and still I have trouble looking in the mirror without cringing. I had cut my skin so badly in my teenage depression, I had actually caused even more permanent damage, leaving everything below the bandana a scarred and disfigured mess.

While I can now see in light fairly well and I have normally tanned skin, I've never gotten over my hatred and fear of light itself. My apartment is always as dark as I can keep it, my monitor is as dim as possible, and I've developed excellent night vision from turning partially nocturnal. However, despite all of this, I've never paid for the plastic surgery to fix my face. I keep it as a reminder of the past and why I got to where I am. I have a whole collection of bandanas to match my suits and ties, and I wear prescription sunglasses. 

And you know what? I'm happy. I have a wonderful family, a well-paid job and loads of free time to spend gaming. So who needs plastic surgery? I look sexy in a bandana anyway. ;D


**TL;DR** *an accident when I was five disfigured my face and made me sensitive to light, I wore a bandana and lost contact with friends over time, was homeschooled, went through angst as a teen which led to cutting my face even further, and eventually majored in psychology after a sudden burst of hope, although I still am terrified of bright lights and my own face.*",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_xpu6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xpu6n/im_afraid_of_light_and_my_own_face_pretty_long/,

I am 18, female. Before I came I'd never kissed anyone. I am unattractive. I have really low self esteem, but it's probably warranted.

My first kiss happened in the worst way possible. I had gone to a party in my dorm, a small one. It was for a guy's birthday. His suitemate (""Sam,"" for all intents and purposes) was very attractive, three years older, and seemed like a cool guy. Way out of my league. I didn't care, I was never particularly interested. I like being friends with guys, because I feel like I can't attract them. Sam seemed nice, I just wanted to be his friend. He had let on over the course of the night that he and his girlfriend were no longer together. I was not aware that she was there earlier in the evening, that they had fought and she had left.

I was having a lot of fun. I had drank quite a bit, but I felt really good. I had no intentions of hooking up with anyone, I just felt like I was making friends. I was feeling confident in my social skills. Later on in the night we moved to another suite. Everyone was smoking weed, and I partook. 

I was sitting on the bed, with a girl in between me and Sam. He began to stroke my arm, which caught me by surprise. I looked at him shyly, I honestly had no idea what to do. I was high and drunk, not in a good state of mind. I remember the look on his face exactly, I had been extremely flattered at the time, but now the memory of his smile makes me sick.

A little later we all went to his room, he declared he was tired a short while later, and kicked everyone out. As I was leaving he stopped me and said ""No, you can stay."" 

I went into his bed and told that I'd never kissed anyone, he asked if I wanted to try. I he began to kiss me, sticking his tongue down my throat. I was confused, I tried, but it wasn't pleasant. Then he told me to get out of bed and take off my clothes. At first I just stripped to my bra and underwear, but he told me to take it all off. I did, he was the first guy who seemed interested in me, I didn't want to disappoint. 

He began to grab my breasts roughly, it was disconcerting. Then he asked me to give him a blowjob. Again, I didn't feel comfortable, but I didn't want to disappoint. I did it and he seemed unsatisfied with my skills and asked me to get on top of him. We tried having sex. He had no condom. It didn't work. I was too tight. I felt inadequate, I couldn't do anything right. So I continued to blow him until he came in my mouth.

What he said immediately after destroyed me. ""This was a mistake, you should leave."" I was crushed. I had done all those things for him, to make him happy, but I had failed. I still had his taste in my mouth (I'm sorry, this is too much information, but I just need to get it out). I felt ashamed, disgusting, inadequate. I went to my room and cried. I felt like a whore.

The next morning he came to my room, apologizing. He said he thought he still loved his ex (they had never broken up, but he didn't tell me that). He also told me I should talk to him if I needed it. He said he thought I was a cool person and that we should be friends. I pretended everything was fine.

For the rest of the week every time I saw him, I panicked and felt deep shame. Later that week I went to talk to him, he had offered after all. I told him that I felt bad about it, that I wanted to be friends but didn't know how. I told him that I felt ashamed about what happened. He told me I was being neurotic. He has avoided me ever since. I guess I was being neurotic. I had thought I could talk to him about it, but I was wrong. ""Don't stick your dick in crazy""--I was crazy. I became really depressed. I was suicidal for a while. Any self worth I had was destroyed by this incident. Which is stupid, I guess. It wasn't a big deal, no one else would react that strongly.

I can't wrap my head around it now. Had I scared him away by being crazy? Why had I done that? Why couldn't I act normally? It's not like he raped me. I had definitely agreed, even though I know I didn't want to. It was completely my fault. 

And I just wanted to know... why me? It seemed he just wanted to get his dick wet. Why did he choose me? There was at least one other girl there, more attractive than me. I just wanted to be friends with him, why did he try to sleep with me? And then why did he toss me off? Maybe it was for the reasons he said. Maybe I didn't perform well. Maybe I am ugly.

I hate myself so much now... but I guess I always did. I think the depression is clinical, spurred by this event. But it's just more proof that I was neurotic and unstable.

The worst part is I don't know how to think about the event. I look back on it and I get an odd mixture of turned on and absolutely disgusted. It was the first contact I'd ever had with a guy. I didn't know what to make of it. And when I see him, I desperately want him to like me, to want to be friends with me again. But I also hate him for making me feel so terrible.

Now I feel severely uncomfortable around guys. I feel like I can only kiss them if I am drunk, and that they will only want me when they are drunk. How could a sober guy want me? I dread my first sober kiss. 

I don't know how to feel about this. I still feel awful and dirty. I feel crazy and worthless. I guess I can't ask you what to think... I need some imput, and I honestly have no idea what people will say. Probably that I am making a big deal out of nothing, that I need to get over it. And I guess it's true, I just don't know how...

TL:DR The night I had my first kiss I almost lost my virginity, all while drunk and high. I feel terrible.

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for what you are saying. This has actually helped me think clearly about this. It took me until now really to see that I don't have to be defined by what this guy, and now what I assume other guys, think of me. It's just a mistake. A stupid one, but the only things that got hurt were my feelings. I really appreciate what all of you have said.**

I was in rare form. While I want some of my commentary to stand as a somber warning of the dangers of drugs and as a testament to my ability to write under the influence of enough narcotics to fell Keith Richards, I apologize for my excessive harassment of my fellow Redditors.

[Idontcaremuch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Idontcaremuch), I come on like a ton of bricks but I sincerely don't want to see you get hurt on your train hopping adventure.

It's worked for me before, and I hope it worked in this case. That said, my commentary has been interpreted as harassment and trolling by most people who read it, and I apologize as such.

Just writing this up is making me feel sick. I feel like almost any other kink is acceptable, but this, no. It's not. It's just weird.

There's something so bizarre about a group of men just jerking off onto a woman's face or in her mouth. Half the thrill for me is that I'm thinking, *Holy shit, this actually happened. This really cute girl said ""Ok, 50 guys, yeah, they can all cum in my mouth and I'll eat it.""* And although I'm into all gangbang videos of women of all ethnicities, I think Japanese women are the most lovely creatures on the planet, and to see them eagerly allowing themselves to be defiled like this is amazing. I can't believe it occurs. And I have to watch it. All of it.

I obsessively download it, categorize and organize my collection, compiling videos of just the best parts edited together. Every few years, the shame becomes too great and I decide to stop and I delete everything I've collected. I quit the sites I've subscribed to. I stop. I did that about a month ago. Two days ago I broke down and resubscribed to one site. For probably the 10th time. The cycle continues.

I don't date. Normal sex is still a turn on for me, but I've got a serious deathgrip, so it's difficult to stay hard with a condom. And if I were to become close to someone I'd either have to hide my bukkake habit and live in shame, or tell them about it and risk them being disgusted by me. Although I know a lot of women are OK with porn, I can't imagine anyone being OK with this.

My friends don't know why I don't date. Their girlfriends and wives try to set me up. I'm a good-looking guy (at least I've been told this enough that I think it's probably true). I'm nice and considerate, I dress well and make good money. All these women say I'd be a ""catch."" But if they only knew about my habit, would they think so? Could anyone accept this about me?

**EDIT:** I just want to say thank you to all you nice strangers on the internet for convincing me I'm not the horrible person I felt I was. You're really amazing. I'm going to accept my fetish and find people in the real world that can accept me for what I am. This is what the internet is all about people!

I never thought I was ever going to have a girlfriend and was really lonely at the time.  It was my freshman year of college where I met this absolutely beautiful girl who I clicked with entirely.  We loved hanging out, the sex was fantastic and we just generally got each other.  The problem was she was still ""friends"" with her ex, and I didn't want to appear controlling or give her a reason to end it so I said I trusted her.  

She wouldn't hang out with him often, or so she said I guess.  I never really interacted with the other guy for more than a few minutes, like when I walked her over to wherever she was meeting him.  It was always a little weird between us.  She always guaranteed nothing happened, they just hung out with some mutual friends.  

Like 6 or 7 months into the relationship, she left her Gmail account logged into my computer.  I couldn't help myself and sifted through it.  She had some really graphic chats with the other guy and her best friend, who apparently knew about what she was doing.

I honestly was just so afraid she would leave me and I needed her so badly at that point in my life, that I just lived in denial at first.  I did some sketchy things and kept track of her passwords, would regularly check her chats for messages with him, to see if she was still seeing him behind my back or if she finally ended it.  We dated for two years despite all this.  I never said a word and she started just treating me like absolute shit.

I have been thinking about saying something now for ages but never had the courage, hell never fully acknowledged that this was an issue but... it is... it's going to be hard but I'll try...

I'm a [M] 22 yo and here's some back story... My earliest memory of being molested is when I was 5 yo, I remember going with my family to a community thing where we'd all gather at the beach, the kids would play in the water and the dads would make some BBQ, I should mention here that my family are Pakistani Expats living in Saudi Arabia... I don't recall much about that day, all I remember is that I was in the water, wearing only underwear and this neighbor kid who was older (mid-teens) came to play with me, I remember him pulling down my underwear and making me sit in his lap while he had his penis out...

Fast forward 4 years and when I was 9 yo, my uncle came to live with us, he slept in our bed with my brother and me, at first he just asked me to rub his back after my brother would go to sleep, then he started rubbing my back, eventually he would touch my butt and asked me to do the same, it later escalated to full-on anal sex...
After two more years, my parents hired a Quran teacher to come to our house and teach my younger siblings the Quran, I was already enrolled in an academy to memorize the Quran so he'd make me sit by his side and usually put his hand in my shirt... he also molested me by having sex with me a couple of times... Later on my parents fired him because my brother told them that his reputation was rather shady, I never said a word...

Finally, in the Quran Academy, many of my classmates and I had exposed ourselves to each other even touched each other on occasion but in particular there was this older guy who became friends with me... He talked to me about sex and masturbation, he'd invite me to his home and we'd perform homosexual acts on each other, to this day I'm not sure if that makes me bisexual because I usually did it so that he'd loan me some porn CDs, but I eventually asked him to stop, it made him angry, he even threatened to expose me as a faggot to everyone but I didn't go back to him.

Here's the deplorable part: When I was about 11, between the episode with my uncle and the Visiting Quran Teacher... We would sleep during the afternoon, usually I slept with my younger brother who is 5 years younger than me, I remember that when we slept together he started touching me... I didn't stop him because it's the same way it started with my uncle... and it shames me to say this but it felt good... later on he would put my hand on his penis...it even reached a point where I asked him to play with mine... but that was it, I told him to stop...

The last thing is a bit recent and thereby the worst in comparison, Last year a cousin of mine was being married and I went to Pakistan to attend the ceremony, during the preparations of the wedding, I would play with the children... one of my cousins who is 14 years old was particularly fond of me... we'd often play hide and seek etc... One evening before the wedding, she and I were alone on the roof, I was running after he and accidentally grabbed her butt... Something animalistic snapped in me, although there was a conscious rational part of me that new it was wrong but I kept thinking how firm her buttocks were, how good it would feel to... violate her.... I made her sit right beside me and continued to talk to her, I didn't directly touch her in anyway further but I used the pretense of tickling her to feel her up a little bit... finally, I thought about getting her to undress or putting my hands inside her skirt... I was ready to do it, in fact I almost felt like I was on the verge of orgasm, the feeling where you're willing to do anything and everything to achieve sexual pleasure but something stopped me, I couldn't bring myself to do it... I asked her to go downstairs and continued to avoid her for the rest of the wedding....

What makes me feel immensely horrid and guilty is the fact that right now both my brother and my cousin may seem fine to me but my abuse at the hands of my uncle and teacher didn't start bothering me till I hit my 20s, I remember that I suddenly starting remembering everything after a very painful breakup and it left me broken... I'm just terrified that I've mentally scarred these kids for life, what If one day they remember what I did to them and get damaged by those memories... In the case of my brother, I know that it was a long time ago and he initiated it but I was the older one, I should have stopped it right there but the case of my cousin absolutely disgusts me... I'm a horrible horrible human being, I hate myself for what I've done, I wish there was some way I could make things right again... My dad always told me that I was a coward, I guess he was right, I never had the courage to stop people from hurting me and now I've become a predatory monster... I live in constant fear of what I might do to a child... it's the very reason why I don't want to have kids... in fact I don't think I'll ever get married...",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_1991v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1991v2/i_was_molested_and_i_didnt_stop_the_cycle/,

This was a few years ago when I was 21 and living in an apartment complex with a good friend of mine in Charleston, SC. The apartment complex we lived in was mostly occupied by college-aged kids and the random old creeper guys. I met this guy who we will call Chris and him and I were hitting it off pretty well. We hung out every day and eventually began dating. I had only had one serious relationship before this when I was in high school and I was pretty naive when it came to boys and dating....

Chris had his Blackberry phone password protected, which is completely normal; however, it sometimes seemed like he was way over protective of that phone and made sure NO ONE knew his password or went looking through it for any reason. I thought it was kind of weird but I didn't think too much on it. 

One night we were drinking and playing music off of his phone. I wanted to change the song so he told me the password to his phone was ""Gizmo"". Chris never would have told me his password in any normal circumstances, but he was really drunk and I guess just let it slip. Once I learned his password I just had to take a look in his phone out of curiousity to see if perhaps he was cheating on me with another girl (I know it is wrong to snoop but I'm nosey, damnit). Boy did I regret that decision.....

I found text messages between him and another guy and Chris had texted him that he   could not wait to get fucked in the ass by his 'big black cock"". He also described wearing a thong for him the next time they met up.

I was so traumatized by this information but I just could not bring myself to confront him. I even continued dating him for a couple months after discovering this. I was really confused and torn as to what to do because I really did care for Chris. Eventually he ended up cheating on me with another girl as well and that is when I snapped the fuck into reality and threw his ass to the trash.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1356709446.0,,,True,t3_15kpxn,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15kpxn/i_found_out_the_guy_i_was_dating_was_getting/,

I say it this way as I was in a serious relationship with a girl for two years before this and of course had intimate times with her seeing as we were 'in love'. 

When she broke up with me, I was devestated. We passed between us a notebook that had letters to each other. Love letters, sweet words telling the other how we cared for them and how much we missed them. Fast forward to the day we broke up. The notebook just so happened to have all of her conversations ripped out and then it was passed around the school. By 2nd period my good friend walked up to me telling me what he had seen. He'd seen the notebook with pages of only *my* letters written to her and her side of the story being I was a stalker and a weird lesbian.

Being a devestated teen I figured I was a bad person for being in love with a women like everyone at school was telling me I was. It was gross, I was perverted, I believed them. I figured I should try and have sex with a man, that'll make me right, right?

Flash to a week later.

I call onto one of those sex lines where you post a voice add, women could do it free, and men would respond to you and you'd talk back and forth. Live Links I think it was called. I start to talk to this man, he says all the right things and eventually only after about 2 hours of talking I eventually say that yes I'd like to meet. Yes, this 17 year old girl wants to meet you random man from Live Links to have sex with.

I don't know his name, his age, anything about him. He shows up to my parents house, during the day ( I skipped school to meet him). I rolls up in a jaguar, really nice car. In his side seat was baseball bats, uniforms, and mitts as he was going to coach little league after our encounter. This person was probably in his mid 30's, probably married, probably had children ( who he coached little league for), quite attractive from a normal persons point of view, great smile, built, slender but muscular, a real looker when I think back on him. Here I am, pretty obviously queer girl with a horrible bowl haircut and 17.

I invite him in, I have on my fanciest panties. They were ugly silk frilly things. We sit on my bed, he asks me what I've done. I tell him about my girlfriend and what has happened to me over the last week. He starts to touch my legs, neck, kissing my neck, telling me that I should be with a man. That he will take care of me.

I'm clearly still a child, especially to this person. He takes off my pants and pulls down his. He puts on his condom and pulls down my panties. We have sex, it was painful, quick, uncomfortable, only for him, I recieved no pleasure and he wasn't there to give me any either. This was all for him. He used my innocence and naivety for his sick pleasure. 

He finished, quickly, than mumbled his number and left. Left me there sad, scared, scarred.

I hate my father with a red hot burning passion. He ruined me, and completely shattered my family. My parents have been married for the last 32 years and since before they were married he has been having affairs...with dozens of different women.  He would send out mass valentines day cards to all of us.  He missed my birthday for ""work"" more time then I could count because of his affairs. He has missed every holiday at least once.  He owns a company and makes a considerable amount of money, more then we knew.  He had opened up a separate account to fund these trips and visits with his mistresses. I've even met some of them before without knowing it. 

I know he didn't cheat on me, but it ruined my family. Completely fucking shattered it. I was living at home with my mother at the time since both my sisters were away at University. I had to take his keys from him and kick him out of the house. Afterwards, my mother was a wreck.  She couldn't do anything. I essentially became the parent. I cooked, i cleaned, I went to school, I held myself together for her. I had to tell both my sisters, over the fucking phone, about what happened. It was the most heartbreaking moment of my life..their automatic shrill screams..like everything they knew ended, it still gives me chills. 

The worst part? My mother took him back. They both believe in some ""sexual addiction"" bullshit that I don't buy. Its an excuse...he is just a slut. I was forced to live at home with him and my mother, at first it was constant fighting, especially since I kept telling her to leave is stupid ass. He was a master manipulator..he some how convinced my mother that **I** was the one ruining their relationship because I didn't want them together. I got the shit beat out of me by both of them on a regular basis, (I have trained in martial arts, muay thai &amp; kravmaga for years so I know how to fight. I just can't bring myself to hit my parents.) they emotionally ruined me. I know my mother didn't mean to..she was confused and hurt and tried her best...she just didn't know how to handle the situation. 

I haven't spoken to my dad in almost a year. A month after we found out about the affair he tried to contact me again, i wouldnt answer. Both my sisters were speaking to him again but only because they didn't know what it was like at home..I didn't tell them a lot of the bad stuff going on. They didnt need to know it, it would only fuck them up more. Well, one night (at this point my dad was living in an apartment) he texted me. He said ""I am sitting here with a bottle of pills, if you don't at least hear what I have to say I am going to kill myself."" Well, I never fucking responded. I deleted the text and didn't tell anyone. I cried, like a fucking baby for about 2 minutes and then I stopped. He didn't go through with it. 

I am ruined as a person. I can't trust anyone. The one man I thought would be forever loyal to our family turned out to be an anal dwelling butt monkey. I broke up with my long term boyfriend the week i found out. I havent been able to have a relationship since. I have tried but i just can't trust anyone. 

sorry for the vent.

I love the journey more than the destination, the unwrapping more than the present - I can't enjoy actually getting anywhere or anything in life because I'm not content with reaching anything. When I've gotten where/what I was yearning for, it never seems to mean nearly as much as it did before I reached my goal.

If I could live in a limbo state where I was perpetually working towards a goal that would never be finished, even though my work always showed signs of progress...I think I'd honestly be more content.

I think I love the idea of something far more than I actually like it in person...and the sad thing is I don't really want to change because, well, being the way I am makes me feel alive...trying to actually enjoy something as much as before I experienced it feels forced.

But how has this affected me?

For starters, my relationships with several people have suffered because of it...because of my selfish need (is it selfish? sorry...I can't help it) to perpetually stay in a mode long after they moved on.

My sex life - I'm a virgin, and deep down....I think I'd rather stay that way. I think I'd rather long for sex and intimacy than actually get laid.

Actually getting anywhere in life - I don't want to commit to anything that would actually give me a leg up: college, getting a car, or hell, even a driver's license - because I'm happier hoping for success than actually being successful.

I'm a fucking joke.

Because I don't want change....I want to stay in the state I'm in forever. I don't want anything new, different or better. Really, I guess I don't. I want the idea of them, sure...but when it boils down to it I'm far, far happier longing for things more than I am having them.

I barely graduated highschool, not because I wasn't smart enough or couldn't do the work, but because I wasn't motivated, and barely ever went to class or did the work. I had no good reasons for this, other than being a stupid teenager who didn't have her priorities straight.

I've dropped out of two colleges, both for once again not being motivated and not doing the work. I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, and was pretty depressed. I finally found a love for cooking and realized that I wanted to pursue that as a career. Since I was new to the business and couldn't find a lot of work, my parents and I talked it over and decided that culinary school was the best option for me. They warned me that this was my last chance, and if I fucked up again, they would pretty much disown me financially.

Well, culinary school isn't at all what I was expecting. Instead of fostering and honing my love for food, I'm finding that my creativity is squandered and that it's all about doing what you're told. Everyone is so competitive to the point that friendships are sometimes ruined. The university's program changed about a year ago, and from what I've been told, the old program was much better and was really about food and love and passion. Now, it all seems so technical. I've really tried, but I can't help but be really unhappy.

I haven't told my parents any of this. They're so proud of me for the first time in years, and I hate letting them down. I hate lying to them, but I really don't know what else to do. I need to find a job so that when I am eventually found out (my grades are suffering because of my unhappiness), I can at least have some money instead of being thrown out into the streets. 

All of my issues with motivation, slacking off, and depression and anxiety, not to mention ADD, started around the time I was 12. Middle school is stressful for everyone, but for some reason I just adopted this new ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude, and it never really went away. This was around the time my grades went from straight A's to low B's and even C's, and thus I really started fighting with my parents.

At 12 I was still a good kid, with not many faults. I hadn't become the sad, angry, slacker that I am today. I know that a lot of people will say that your mistakes help you out in life, and make you who you are today, but I really don't care. If I could do it all over again I would. I would be a better daughter, sister, friend, student, person, everything.

All I want is another chance at life. I'm told repeatedly that I have so much potential. I don't want to just have potential. I want to actually be that good person. Get good grades, graduate highschool with honors or whatever, go to a good school, make lifelong friends, find a great job, and meet the love of my life and get married and have babies and all that. I really feel like I've put all those things in jeopardy for what started in middle school for me. Now I'll probably end up working a string of dead end jobs, always be poor, and die alone.

Sorry this has been so long. I just needed to get a lot of stuff off my chest.

Her therapist also has mentioned Borderline Personality Disorder, although it remains undiagnosed. As a result of these disorders, she weighs her feelings on me almost all day, every day. 

I love the girl more than my own life. She is the mother of my child, and the girl I am proud to hold at night and and would do anything for. However, her depression, while severely crippling for her, is also exhausting for me. She constantly keeps me up late at night upset about how miserable in her life she is, how nobody cares about her, or how she's a bad mother. I see everyone day how amazing of a mother she is and contradictory evidence of all of these things. I try to comfort her, but attempts are futile. 

Sometimes, during these depressive and often suicidal episodes, I just start to agree with her in my head. I start to desire her to be gone so I could finally get some sleep, or have a night without wondering if I'll say the wrong thing and send her in to a bout of depression or that we'll see something on TV that will reminder her off her mother across the country, sending her to tears. It would be nice. 


She currently goes to a therapist about once every two weeks. She has been on prozac for about a week and a half now and we're waiting for it to kick in. 

I know she is sick, and she can't help the way she feels. Her brain has a chemical imbalance that simply disallows her to be happy to content. I try to be sensitive and empathetic. I try to understand, but the process is just so fucking exhausting. 


I have a severe case of ADHD and one hell of a temper. She has major depression and OCD. I often look down at my son snd tell him, ""flip a coin, kid, because either side of the genetic coin you get, you're gonna be fucked."" 

I want her to be happy. It will make me happy. I just hope she'll stay happy. Because I don't know how much longer I can do this. 

Thank you, /r/confession, I needed you.


**Edit:**

I really didn't expect this much of a response. Let me address a few things brought up by the majority of comments:

Prozac will not be the first anti-depressant she has been on. She took Celexa earlier in the spring, but it stopped working. I appreciate the advice on the patience. We're both patiently waiting. 

As for the top comment, burnt out is a very good way to describe it. It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one and that this feeling is normal.   

For those of you that are calling me a bad person, I highly doubt you've been in the situation that I, as well as many commenters here, have been in. I love her very much, and I accept and overlook her sickness. However, her sickness is not the equivalent of a cold, or something physical that only affects them. A sickness like the one I and others have described are sometimes crushing to a partner in a relationship. It effects the other it affects the other to a degree that can only be seen from behind closed doors, and most of the time, closed mouths.

When I was 6-7 years old A new boy moved in next door, and we struck up a good friendship. This friendship turned into lots of sexual play including oral sex and heavy petting. At that age I was able to get erections, and was curious about the physical sensations. After a long while of playing around he showed me something else we could do, which turned out to be anal sex. So when we did that I officially lost my virginity.  

It took me until I was 18-19 to be able to see myself naked without being disgusted. I spent years wanting to vomit when I took showers, because being naked was horrible once I was old enough to realise what I had done, what I had thrown away because I was being an idiotic child who didn't understand that those physical sensations actually meant something beautiful. On top of that I felt this huge unclean stigma attached to me because I was starting to learn that since it was with another male it was ""extra wrong"". So it took me many years to be able to come to terms with my own Bisexuality/Pansexuality/Demisexuality, whatever you'd like to call it.   

After that I didn't even think about sex until I was 19-20, and have only slept with one other person  in my life.

It’s not like I was Pablo Escobar or anything. If I’ve accidentally any words I’m sorry, I’ll re-draft it again later. Must get back to work now. 

Skip to the **TLDR** below if you want. 

Before I begin, let me state: **I’m not proud of these moments in my life.**


**14-16**

It began when I was 14. I used to smoke a lot of weed and it got very expensive very quickly. I started selling to close friends so that my smoke was free, but slowly business built up and before I knew it I was making a profit. I always sold bags overweight and was honest so people kept coming back. After about 2 years, I was making about 3-4K a month. My parents had no idea until they found a bong, then started searching my room. They would take my drugs and try and reprimand me, but I just ignored them. I wasn’t a bad kid, I wasn’t aggressive, I did good at school and went every day, I had good friends who weren’t in to drugs and we used to play a  lot of sport together, so it was conflicting for them. They would just try and explain to me about the risks of getting caught, and take my drugs if they ever found them. I bought a safe to stop that happening.  


When I was around about 16 years old, after I’d been selling for 2 or so years, I decided to expand. I needed a car, and a few k a month wasn’t going to cut it. I asked my dealers what else they had and they started me selling meth, x and LSD and coke. Back in the suburbs, people went wild for this. It boosted profits very quickly, and also brought me to the attention of several other dealers in the area. I had stayed relatively under the radar until then, because I really only sold to friends and those in my high school. I had, unbeknownst to me, began encroaching on a number of other established dealers territory’s. 


My first set back came when I had a late night phone call from a friend asking if I could supply his friend with a large amount of coke. I’d done large deals before so I was phased by that, but I was wary because I hadn’t sold to friends of friends before, only people I directly knew. What I didn’t know was, my friend was at a rival dealers house and had been threatened that if he didn’t set me up that he wasn’t leaving in tact. I walked right in to my first ambush, and realised that up until that point luck had gotten me by, not any real kind of skill. 


They stole about 4k’s worth of coke, but didn’t hurt me. They made it clear that I wasn’t to deal in a list of suburbs (basically so many that it put me out of business) and that if I did, next time would be much worse.  Being 16, and whilst good at selling drugs, I was not very experienced in the art of intimidation or violence. I’m a skinny white kid and had never been in a fight in my life, let alone had any knowledge of how to beef with unemployed full time drug dealers. I did what seemed logical, I paid 20 or so gang members from an Asian gang in my area to send a message to those who wanted me out of business.  Stupid in hindsight and totally of out character. 


For the next few days I would drive around with them pointing out those who were affiliated with the people trying to drive me out of business, and they would send a clear message. I didn’t feel good about this, but I didn’t know what else to do. I’d come to rely on the money, and justified it by telling myself I didn’t start this, and they had no right to tell me to stop dealing. It got out of control very quickly when one of the people we attacked fought back. He was beaten pretty bad, and during which I tried to convince some of them to stop. I was told quite plainly, this was what I wanted. After that, there were a few retaliatory attacks against those I’d employed to help me, but I had somehow been forgotten about. I decided I would never go that route again, and kept selling discreetly for another 2 years until I was 18. 


**17-18**

I didn’t have any further violent run in’s, but my next challenge was with the police. My street was always filled with cars, and when I was around about 17 I was at the peak of my selling. I would have 7-8 cars lined up in a row outside my parents house, and I would go from car to car dropping their order in the front seat. My neighbours had banded together to stop me, and started noting down the license plates of my customers, duration and frequency of their  visits, and taking photos of me in the act of selling. This brought the police to my house one afternoon. 


The cops sat down with my parents and informed me of my neighbourhoods surveillance and suspicions. They asked me to explain myself. I said I couldn’t, that it wasn’t what it looked like and denied everything. My parents, even though they knew the truth, backed me up. The cops had nothing on me, apart from my neighbours suspicions and blurry photographs that showed nothing. They told me that things would get very serious when I turned 18, and that I should think about that. I did. 


A month before my 18th birthday, I changed my phone number, got rid of the last of my product and stopped selling. 


**18-28**

I became a little reclusive and went to a university interstate to study computer science. No-one there knew my past, I didn’t ever talk about, and explained my lack of working and supply of cash as savings from investments my dad helped me with.  


I finished university when I was 21 with good grades, and after a pretty uneventful 3 years moved back to my hometown and in to a house with an old friend. My drug money had run out a year in to University, and I had survived working part time as a porter. When I moved back, I got a job working part time at a mobile phone shop whilst looking for a better job in my field of study. 


One drunken night sitting around the TV with my friend, we began talking about old times. He knew all about me, but we never really spoke about it. We wrote music together, and that was how we became friends when we were kids. Drugs weren’t something we spoke about or did together. He had been  an on/off weed smoker/tripper  and a small time dealer himself, but had never had any drama like I had. He was smart, kept it small, and only used it to fund his infrequent habit. Like me, he hadn’t sold drugs for years either. 


Neither of us were broke or living beneath the poverty line. We were renting a house in a nice area near our families, and were getting by. We began joking about how it easy it would be to start selling drugs again to fund a better lifestyle. Before long the conversation turned to drug production. We talked about how we never had the opportunity before because we were always living with our parents or in  uni share housing.  I don’t know exactly what pushed the decision over the edge, but before I knew it we had built a significant hydroponic set up and were both dealing again. 


We did this for about a year, and it was very different to my earlier years – mainly because of my incredibly cautious friend. We were very careful about who we sold to. We only sold large quantities, made people stay at least a few hours, only did deals inside the house, restricted the number of deals we did in one day. We made out with about 30k in cash each after a year, and thankfully my smart friend convinced me to get out whilst we were on top. I was almost 23. 


About 6 months later, I met a girl and we moved in together. My friend got married, and we never told anyone or spoke about where our money came from. No-one knows about our hydroponic lab to this day. My girlfriend knows pieces of my past, and that I had sold drugs, but didn’t know to what extent. She knows it’s in my past, that it’s not  who I am any longer (well, until a few years later),  and we didn’t speak about it any further. I got a job in my field of study, and started working my way up the corporate ladder. 


**28-30**

My girlfriend and I had been earning good money for about 4-5 years, and we decided it was time we buy a house together. We bought a house that was probably a little out of our price range, and the bills mounted up very quickly. It wasn’t long before we were trying to find ways to increase our income. I was browsing the net one day, and stumbled across bitcoin. It was intriguing, and I was captivated by it’s potential to make profits that weren’t tracked by the tax department.  I spent many months researching and getting to understand how I could use the bitcoin system to make money. During my research I of course found out that a large number of people wanted coins to buy drugs on the Silk Road. I invested about 20k in to the system and traded coins for about a year across a number of exchanges. When I wanted to cash out, I would sell the coins via gumtree or craigs list for cash in the mail or in though person exchanges. After a few months, and making less than impressive  profits. I started to think about The Silk Road. 


I had told myself years ago I wouldn’t start selling drugs again. I had gotten away with it previously, and it was insane to risk it ever again. I called my hydro house friend, and he me told I was crazy to even think about it. I explained about SR and my plan, and he said even though it sounded bullet proof, there is always something you forget. I took his words of wisdom to heart, and documented the process to ensure I understood how it worked. I then spent the next week writing this document 


http://ge.tt/6Kj3S1G/v/0 


I posted it on a number of drug forums for feedback, and showed it to my friend. It got a few thousand views pretty quickly, and then others began linking to it. My friend still said it was a bad idea, but couldn’t question my level of preparation. My girl and I talked about it, and she hated the idea. She knew it was something I had gotten away with before, but knew that once I set my mind to something, it was hard to talk me out of it. She begrudgingly agreed to not stop me, but if anything ever happened she would  feign ignorance and I would need to take all the blame. I of course agreed. I don’t think she entirely knew the possible consequences of what she was agreeing to. I had distribution and laundering covered. I all I needed was a supply. I told myself and my girl that I would stop when I made 20k. 


I spent the next 6 months finding reliable IRL dealers, establishing my SR methods and rapport on the site, and perfecting my system. After another few months, I had a good flow of product out, and an equal flow of cash in from the BTC I sold. It was working. It was around this time, I started to get really paranoid and stressed. It wasn’t like the times before. This time I had a worried girlfriend asking me when I was going to stop, I had a good career I was risking and keeping up with selling on SR and laundering the cash IRL was a full time job and then some.


I got to 20k in about a year and dismantled the operation as I had set out to. I had kept my promise to my girlfriend,  and she was glad it was over. I still can’t believe I got her to be ok with it. We use the cash to buy groceries, clothes and other untraceable/reportable items, and this allows me to put more cash on my mortgage. 


**Today**


It’s been about 7 months since I stopped selling on SR. I think about it all the time. I know I’ve now gotten away with selling drugs too many times in my life to ever risk it again. I make enough money from my job that I don’t need to do this, and haven’t ever really needed to. I would have been fine financially if I didn’t make that 20k. I regret taking the risk on SR, but the extra cash was nice. I know it’s greed that often gets people caught, and that’s what I’m fighting now. It’s a business I’ve understood since I was a kid, and I’ve always been more interested in the profits than the partying aspect of drugs. I think constantly about trying to convince my girl to let me try again, but I don’t think for a second she would be ok with it again. I think I only got  her to agree to it because she was blind sided and shocked that I would even ask her. Now she’s thought about it more, the risk has sunk in. It should have sunk in for me too. I think I like the risk. I like having a double life that people don’t know about. 


I’m sitting here in my office writing this, and people assume I’m drafting a contract for our latest project. It’s bizarre, and I’m afraid that one day I’ll take the risk again and maybe not get away with it. 


I hope this doesn’t come across as a bragfession. I am not proud of selling drugs and would never encourage anyone else to. 


It’s peculiar that if I were to give myself advice, it would be: 


Don’t bother selling drugs, its’ too much effort and a lifestyle you don’t want to lead. You’ll be forever watching your back from police or snitches, and to make any real money (200k+) you need involve yourself with very dangerous people and circumstances. It’s just as much work to go to school and work your way up the corporate ladder – the obvious benefits being you can’t get arrested and you can tell your friends what you do. You can make a pile of cash by being a shrewd businessman, and the cops can’t touch you.


I just need to take my own advice. 


**TLDR;** Sold drugs from 14-18 and got away with it despite a close call with police and violent rival drug dealers. Ran a hydroponic house when I was 21-23. Sold drugs on SR and made about 20k when I was 28-30. Work in management of a large corporation and no-one knows.

So one day I am out in my dad's truck and needed a napkin.  I go to the check the glove compartment but it is locked.  I unlock it and there are four condoms in there.   My mom had a hysterectomy and I knew could not get pregnant.

I was kind of floored.  Their marriage wasn't some fairytale but they were always happy, they would disagree sometimes but issues were talked out.  I struggled with what I should do.  Should I tell my mom?  Should I confront my dad?  Should I find out who my dad is banging?

I finally decided that I didn't know my parents relationship and I was going to leave it alone.   My dad was using protection so my mom was safe.  It has been 20 years and I still question my decision.  Was I just being a chicken shit?  Did my mom deserve to know?

The guilt of keeping it a secret and knowing whether I made the right call, stinks.   I couldn't talk to anyone about it.  Everyone loved my dad, he was a little reserved but funny and caring.  My siblings, friends, and GFs/wife all looked up to him, so I didn't feel like I could say anything to them.

I thought, well maybe one day after my dad dies it will be okay to tell someone to release this guilt of mine.  He passed a few years ago but it's the opposite, now there is more pressure to not say anything.  He was well thought of before, now he is a saint.  I realized that confessing now wouldn't do anything but hurt other people and might not even relieve my guilt.

But then I found reddit and recently /r/confession.  No one IRL knows my account name.  So here is my confession....

tl;dr  I found out my dad slept with someone.  I never told a soul.  I feel guilty but there is NO one I feel I can tell about it except reddit.


Edit:  Thanks for the responses.  I am not going to tell anyone, since he died I knew I couldn't.  I posted here just to get it out of my system.  Also, I appreciate the posts ""sticking up"" for my dad, that he may not have been cheating, but I know he was.  The good thing is it was very easy for me to not let it affect our relationship.  I was stunned but never mad at him, I don't why.

We were friends for a while back then, but nothing serious. Her name was Regina and she lived in Michigan. She went by the nickname RvBFan.
When 2010 rolled around, shit got a little more serious. We started talking a lot more. Things got even more serious when we added each other on msn. I guess this is when our dating officially started. The summer of 2010 I literally did nothing but talk to her all day and watch movies/play games with her. It was the best summer of my life. There is something important you have to know, and that is I'm very introverted. This is the only reason why this went on so long. I was too scared to ask for her facebook because I thought she would see how little friends I had and think I was a loser. I was scared to talk to her on the phone/etc because I know more about defusing bombs than communicating with women irl.
So summer was awesome. Then September came along and its when I wanted something more. I was scared as hell, but I really wanted to talk to her on the phone, or on ventrilo or something. Pretty much knew everything about her so I was ready.
She was too nervous to talk to me though. So I made her a deal. I would get to level 99 on Diablo 2 (all you need to know is that this takes a good 2-4 months to accomplish) if she went on ventrilo and talked with me. She agreed.

So I started playing Diablo again. I played that shit. I played it all day. Then I played it some more. You should also keep in mind that I was in grade 12 at this point, and I was skipping every class just to play.
So I finally got 99 May 30th, 2011. She was afk all day and made me wait for her to get on ventrilo. Finally, way late at night, we got on. It was one of the most exciting times in my life. Then she spoke. It was a mans voice. His voice was deeper than mine.
Naturally, I started saying a bunch of 'what the fucks' on msn. I don't remember much about what I said, but a lot of swearing was involved.
And then, he left. Disappeared. Its been 583 days since he has gone and I've still haven't heard from him.
This really fucked me up big time. I have so many god damn issues now because of this. And all I even want is to talk to him again. To know why he did it. Was it a troll all along? Did it start out innocently and end up becoming something too big for him to deal with? Why?

I've been feeling really good lately, so I thought I'd let my dark little secret out (I figure no comments could bring me down!). This might get a little long as I think the backstory is kind of necessary, so stick with me!

For the past few years, I've been struggling with depression. I think it's pretty mild, but I guess it gets bad sometimes. I finished up high school pretty well regardless, but as a result, I had incredible anxiety about starting college. Excelling in high school put me in a bad place because my parents, oblivious to my state of mind, pushed me to go to the best school I could get into. And I did. To be fair, it was my original dream school, so hopefully, I'll end up happy there.

I stumbled out of the gate, but I really picked it up toward the end of first semester. I functioned the same way second semester. Overall, I suppose it wasn't too bad, but I still underperformed relative to my expectations. The thing is on top of my already existing sense of worthlessness my poor grades really weighed on me and pushed me into doing drugs. And by doing drugs I mean I drank enough to not be afraid to pretend to be as drunk as everyone else, and I smoked enough to hangout with kids with skateboards (sorry people who enjoy skateboarding but not weed). Basically, not much, but enough to be a great departure from my usual lifestyle. After that, I started to become more social.

I got to know a lot of people, and I started to feel a little better about myself, but I still felt something missing in my life. I didn't have anyone that loved me; I felt empty. 

Depression is a pretty big turn off apparently, so I've never really had a girlfriend. I had a thing with one girl, but she said she didn't want to get serious because she felt I was too distant a person to commit to. Whoops. 

So feeling pretty shitty one night (around the end of November if I remember correctly), I flipped on the TV and caught a Workaholics rerun. My roommate came in and sat next to me sometime before they start talking about the least amount of money they would take to suck a dude off. During the first commercial after that, he turned to me asks the same question. I just shot back Adam's reply of something something ""$900."" He gave a courtesy laugh and said ""No really. How much? I think I'd take like $100 to be honest."" I hesitated and soon blurted out ""30."" I didn't really believe I sold myself at $30, but he laughed and said he'd pay three times as much for me. How sweet. And that was the end of it. Or was it?

It wasn't. Maybe 3 or 4 days later he comes over to my desk and lays down $30 in front of me. I looked up at him, and after some awkwardness, we start to talk about why, and it turns out he was kind of like me. No girlfriends, feels empty. I didn't mention how I was feeling though. I really felt for the guy, and I thought it was an opportunity for my to fulfill myself as well. Just him laying down the money was enough to make me feel desirable for once. The actual experience was quite strange at first, but I liked it. It was quick and clean cut (though not actually clean), and he kind of shook it off right after, but it stayed in my mind for awhile. I brought it up later that night, and we both thought it could be a somewhat regular thing.

It went downhill from there. We did pretty much the same thing again a few times, but then after winter/Christmas break, a friend of his approached me. I swear I nearly fainted; I thought my secret was out. It turns out this friend of his was in the closet, but he never had any real release. My friend threw me under the bus and mentioned my name to him, and I just couldn't turn him away. I knew what I could do for him, and I knew what he could do for me. He didn't just want a blowjob though. I was hesitant to do more, but I guess everything has its price. 

Word spread slowly to a very small collection of people, but it spread, and I got worried. It tailed off toward the end of the year, and I remained at 8 ""customers"" *shudders* for the last two months of the semester, so I had some confidence that I wouldn't be revealed. At that point though, I was no longer just doing a favor for a friend. I was essentially a prostitute turning tricks for money. The money was almost secondary though. These guys made me feel desirable, loved, *happy*.

I set up specific rules with these guys. There were things I would and wouldn't do, and they had to tell me exactly what they wanted before we started, or I wouldn't do it. I don't like surprises. I've done some bad bad things, things not many people outside of porn have done, and I am really ashamed of myself, but I don't think I can give up what these guys do for me lest I revert back to my old self.

Ask me anything you like I guess. Just don't ask where I live/where I go to school/etc.

1363653535.0,128,self.confession,1ak80v,"I've been a bit of a sick, voyeuristic fuck when it comes to one of my close, female friends.",215,87,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ak80v/ive_been_a_bit_of_a_sick_voyeuristic_fuck_when_it/,"I am a young male, fresh outta high school, and I have a close female friend that I spend a lot of time with. Nothing more than that, I have a girlfriend who is also actually best friends with her. The three of us have hung out together on many many occasions and known each other for years, we're the few people from high school who still hang out regularly. I get along with this girl very, very well. She's almost like my sister, I really love her and our friendship. But, the problem is, she is insanely hot. Incredibly attractive, and with a bubbly, flirtatious personality to boot. She's got it, and she knows it, and she flaunts it. We have flirted a lot in the past, but she does this with everyone, and it really is harmless for the most part. But, I guess, I have to admit I am very, very attracted to her physically. 

Being such good friends, and best friends with my girlfriend, we've lived in close quarters before. Hell, she even lived with me and my girlfriend for a few months. I remember trying to get a peek at her when she'd take a shower occasionally. Never was I lucky to get a good look. But there were a few other occasions, which I still look back on regularly. The first was when she was still living with us, and she was dealing with various, horrible illnesses. She was always sick and had a lot of problems with her 'insides'.. She had to get a colonoscopy at one point, and in preparation, the doctors gave her some drink pumped with laxatives and some other insane shit so she could cleanse her systems before going under. This is probably a good time to mention I have a really intense fart/scat fetish.. you might know where this is headed. One morning, after drinking a whole bottle of the stuff, she awoke moaning and groaning. I was getting ready for work and I knew what this meant. She had already made it clear what she was doing and to excuse her constant trips to the toilet. But this morning was bad. She was clearly in a lot of pain and discomfort, stumbling to the toilet with a strained look on her face. She glanced at me with shame as she closed the door. I quickly headed out side, my partner still sleeping, and went around the back of the house to where the window to the toilet was. I stood beside this window while my friend painfully and shamelessly relieved herself, grunting and swearing as she painted the bowl with her shit. It sounded horrific. She was making all sorts of noises, from both orifices, cursing herself and the relentless storm of shit continued. I have never been so aroused in my entire life. I started masturbating right there, around the side of the house, outside the window. I still feel a lot of disgust and shame for that memory, but I look back on it regularly, and it always gets me hard instantly. I know this probably sounds absolutely putrid to you readers, but as someone who, for some reason, is attracted to this kind of thing, this was literally a page out of my book of fantasies. I was blown away, to share such an intimate, animalistic moment with someone so close, and so fucking hot.

Another particularly creepy and sleazy moment occured a while down the track from the last incident. By now, she had moved out of our place, but had come round just to chill for the night, like she often did with me and my partner. We all watched a movie, and my partner and this girl fell asleep watching it on the couch. My partner was on one couch, my friend on the other. But the position she had fallen asleep in was very... opportunistic. She was curled up in the fetal position, facing away from the TV. So her tight little ass, which was barely covered by the thin material of her yoga pants, was sticking right out. Her *amazing* ass. I could make out her pussy, squished in between her thighs, through the thin lycra material. I slowly crept up, on all fours, towards her ass while the girls slept, my partner only metres away, and a very light sleeper. I managed to move slowly and quiet enough to get my face a mere centimeter away from her ass and pussy. I was so close I could smell it. I could smell that beautiful smell of a young, fresh pussy. That tangy, bitter odor. My face was basically in there, and she was none the wiser. I knelt there, taking in deep breaths, almost tempted to lick it, just the tiniest bit. But I guess I has some small morsel of dignity left. I went straight into the bathroom and masturbated.

As intense and amazing as the arousal gained from these voyeuristic activities was, I still feel great shame over them. This girl is a very close, loved friend of mine, and I exploited her, without her knowledge, for my own sick, sexual fantasies. On a deep level, I objectified her in a pretty big way and I hate that. She is a woman I respect and admire. I also hate the way I have gone behind my partners back and received sexual gratification from another woman, her best friend no less. I have mixed emotions, I'm certainly happy I have those memories, I look back on them fondly. But I know what those memories reflect about myself, that when no one's looking, I will do what I have to to achieve my sexual stimulation. I paint myself as this moralistic, respectful individual, and for the most part, I am. People would be shocked to hear of this from me, not just because of the nature of the action, but because it's so against my nature. But it has made me realize that this is my real nature, which is always going to be ruled by these primal, sexual urges. That once social norms and status quo and *consequences* are not present, all of that intellectual, moralistic shit gets thrown right out the window, in no less than a second.",,True,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_1ak80v,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ak80v/ive_been_a_bit_of_a_sick_voyeuristic_fuck_when_it/,

It is true that I don't plan to live to see 30, and it is true that I ate a bunch of pills.** I flipped out in my desperation and wrote this post. I didn't mean to alarm people, and I didn't mean to seem like a troll.  A lot of you have said some nice things, and I've felt a little better since I've read them, but alternatively I feel shitty for having ever put this on others to any degree.  Thank you all for your responses, and I'm sorry I worried you and I'm sorry I posted this.

Barring any unforeseen situation, I know for a fact I will not die of old age. Now, I've heard all the platitudes, all the ""but people love you"" or ""Suicide is selfish"" bullshit, but given my circumstances there really is no other foreseeable end for me.

Let me tell you a quick story: I've watched a lot of my family die. Ever since I was 11 or 12 I've watched someone die every two or three years. Deaths in the family might not seem like much, but I've never had anyone to reach out to for emotional comfort. When my dad passed away after battling cancer for 8 months I basically lost it. I had no one to turn to, no understanding friends, no girlfriend, nothing. Now I'm 26, I've been an alcoholic for 5 years, drinking nearly nightly. At best I may have gone 5 to 7 days sober in those 5 years. I've not been on a date for 3 years since I've had my confidence trashed, and it was trashed because I wanted sex to be meaningful and not just pleasure. I've tried asking my two female friends to just cuddle with me, which I understand is intimate, but I need the emotional comfort. Neither one wants to help me, so I don't have anyone to care for me on an important emotional level. 

All that being said, I've been in deep emotional pain for years. No one has any interest in providing even the simplest of comfort to me, and I have no ability to go seek it. Eventually, one month before I turn 30, I'm going to off myself one way or another. By then I'll have suffered for 30 years, why should I want to suffer another 60? 30? or even one more year? No one has proven that I am deeply important, so they can cry at a funeral and pretend I meant something, but they're never going to take the time to prove I did.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1354106990.0,,,True,t3_13vl2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/13vl2t/i_will_eventually_kill_myself/,

It'll clear my thoughts. Here goes. 

It was about 6 years ago, shit, that much really has gone by eh? I can still see you, outlined in the darkness, your sweating shillouette standing there, breathing deeply. Naked. Not knowing what to do. 

We had been friends for about 5 months at this time. The second I met you I knew that I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around you and fuck the living day lights out of you. I could tell from the indent in the small of your back that you had been working out. No one looks like that naturally. No one. 

You were helping my housemate move into our new house. I had never met her before, and I had certainly not met you. You were wearing loose fitting jeans that still hugged your perfectly shaped ass in a way that made me go crazy, and the white t-shirt you wore made you look a little euro trash, but your smile made me look past that. 

I walked right up to you and introduced myself. You said your name was Craig, I said my name was Rob. You were Hungarian, I was Canadian. You had no accent, I still had the reminance of my Londoner's (England) lilt that you said you found charming. I couldn't help but make eye contact with you. I wanted to do nothing but to just stare at you all day. Watch you help her move her things in.

Since it was summer and we were both living in a po-dunk university town, there was no one around and very little to do. You came by my place often. Mostly to see my housemate (Let's call her Bindi) but I was often on the poarch. Those were the days of joint smoking, beer drinking, and constant gym visits. I lived well, and paid the price for it. I had a body to maintain and that was never easy. I was pretty ripped at this point, and still am, but nothing compared to you. 

You were standing on my front poarch one august morning, sweat dripping down the front of your body. I could see the pools hovering in each rippled crack and crevice of your perfectly formed torso. Your pecks heaving up and down from the yard work you were doing for our neighbours next door. 

I sat on the poarch with you and Bindi and joked a couple hours. NOthing to talk about, just days to wile away in the company of a beautiful man and an awesome girl. 

There was a time when I thought you and Bindi were a thing, but that was quickly stopped when I was introduced to Bindi's boyfriend, one of the best damn men I have ever met. They're still together. They're still extremely happy. I'm proud of them. 

One afternoon I was sitting on the poarch, sweet-tea and whiskey in one had, a cigarette in the other and the newest copy of Vogue sitting in my lap. I saw you walking up the drive and shouted out to you. You responded with your usual uber macho head nod and smile. 

I explained that Bindi had gone out. You told me that you weren't there to see her, but rather to see me. YOu wanted to get to know me better. YOu wanted to hang out. I wasn't going to object. Never. Not at all. 

We drank, we drank heavily. Some other friends came over, but you and I never stopped giving one another strange looks, looks that expressed some kind of interest. An interest I could only hope was true to what I thought was going on. An interest that I wanted to be more than just ""an interest.""

We drank for six hours, everyone was drunk, and we all decided to head out to the bar. We came back home after more drinking around 1am, and you told me you were too drunk to drive. I told you to stay on my couch in the living room. You had told me that you were straight, I didn't correct you. 

At 2am I heard a knocking on my door. I had passed out and struggled to wake up. I grumbled a lifeless, ""come in"" and the door swung open. I couldn't properly make out who it was, since they didn't turn on the light, and I stared in the darkness for a while. I could see it was you. 

You stood there, not moving. I could tell you were only wearing boxers, and you were trembling. It was about 100F so you weren't trembling from cold, you were scared. I sat up. Confused, drunk and somewhat unnerved. You moved closer. 

I had no idea what to do. You just kept coming closer and closer to me. You sat at the edge of the bed. You still didn't say a word to me, I tried to ask if you were ok,or you needed anything, but you just put your hand on my leg and squeezed. I stopped talking. 

You looked at me, you looked like you had been crying. The light coming through the window light up your face. I asked if you were ok, and you told me that you weren't but that now you were better than ok. You were perfect, and you told me I was perfect. 

I could feel where this was going, I had never experienced anything like this before. I was gay, I was single, but as far as I knew you were straight. You were the body building hungarian that all my female friends taunted me about, and told me to stop liking because things like this don't happen in real life. 

I sat up in bed, clutching the covers since I was stark naked underneath; I had developed this habit a couple years ago and still insist on it. You moved closer and closer. You put your hand on my shoulder and I just kept asking if you were ok.

You gentle pushed me back down onto the bed, and crawled on top of me. Only the sheets seperating our now heavily breathing bodies. I could feel your stomach pressing down onto me with every breath you took. You were nervous and scared. 

You took your hands and placed them on my shoulder, and pressed yourself up so you could have a proper view of my face. I looked slightly away since I was still some-what scared and confused. You knew what you wanted. 

You kissed me, and I didn't move. Not a single word had been spoken. You started to slowly push down the sheets, and I started to rapidly get hard. First my chest, then my stomach. I stopped you before my hard cock came into sight. I grabbed the sheet, and look straight into your eyes. Lust was the only thing I saw, and I knew I could let go. I did. 

You removed the sheet, I was completely naked. You still wore your boxers. You stood up, and pulled them off. Both of us, naked, not knowing what to do. You got into bed. You got back on top of me and kissed me.

I can still feel your pelvis grinding against mine. This was your first time, and you had no idea what to do with a boy in bed. I could see what you wanted to do and I let you. 

I rolled onto my side, you got behind me. I could feel your massive dick enter my ass and I could feel the pain of first-time intercourse. You fucked me like a woman. I hurt like hell but it was all I wanted. 

We fell asleep entangled with one another. I woke up first and quietly climed out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. By the time I got back to the room, you were awake and busy texting your boss with an elaborate explanation of why you wouldn't be able to make it into work that day. I froze. I had hoped you would have left. 

You just looked at me. I could see the birth of a smile. Slow from the corner of the mouth, then travelling across the face, and then to your eyes. YOur fucking beautiful eyes. 

I apologized; I had slept with straight boys before and knew that they liked to be made to feel that all the decisions were made by me and I was the reason we ended up sleeping together. SOmething about allowing them to remember that they were men, or what have you. 

He got up, told me that he had to go and left my room. But you were smiling? Why'd you leave? I hauled some clothes on and went to the ever-faithful poarch to have a smoke. I finished my cigaretted and opened the door to my bedroom again. You were in there. YOu had come in the backdoor from the garden entrance while I was out front. 

You had 2 coffees. 2 sandwiches, and 2 cupcakes. You got us breakfast. You didn't really need to leave. You wanted to surprise me. All you said to me was, ""So, do you wanna?"" I thought you meant breakfast...the pace with which you removed your clothes clearly showed you wanted something else. 

This continued for 2 years. We fucked like rabbits. People knew, we dated towards the end, but as with all young romances, it ended. You're now married to a wonderful woman, and I wouldn't trade my husband for anything in the world. 

But there we go. That was us.

http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x2o41/husbands_of_redditim_the_man_fucking_your_wife/

Oh boy.  This got quite a bit more attention than I anticipated. 

Lot of hate.  Wasn’t expecting that much to be honest.

It’s pretty obvious there are quite a few people on here who have been affected by infidelity, whether as a partner or as the child of parents in this situation.  To all of you I’m sorry if my words hit close to home.

I’ve had some time to step back from the situation and regroup.  I’m still terribly embarrassed and ashamed by my actions and for those asking, I am committed to not repeating this type of behavior.  It’s not worth the destruction and mayhem it causes.

I do want to respond to a couple accusations / assumptions made about me and my situation before giving am update on what has happened since.

I know that pretty much any response I make to inaccuracies is going to be attributed to trying to explain away my actions.  Let me stop you there.  It’s not.  I know what I did was fucked up and wrong and I don’t deny that for a second, nor am I trying to paint my anonymous self in a better light.  I’m just going to give you some insight into how things really went from my perspective.

Firstly, these women were not some “wounded antelope” that I preyed on, far from it.  I’m not attracted to vulnerability or weakness.  Quite the opposite actually.  The women that I did carry on relationships with were strong, self aware, educated, confident…..just unhappy.  I’m not some lion stalking prey on the savannah looking for my next kill.  And it wasn’t only about the sex.  These women were getting a sense of excitement, a thrill from meeting someone who was genuinely interested in them as a woman.  In some cases, something they hadn’t felt in years. I fed off that excitement.  It made me feel good that I could help someone who was unhappy feel a little bit of joy and desire.  And the unhappiness that comes with a fractured relationship is so deep, people in these situations so hurt and looking for some kind of connection, I just got sucked into trying to help a bit.  That’s probably not a healthy motivator either, but nonetheless it wasn’t just about sex, it was also about trying to help.  And not to say that I didn’t enjoy the sex, because I did.  Different kind of sex.  Intense, passionate, appreciative, forbidden.  Something that comes along much later in a relationship, something I’m not really interested in at this point in my life.

UPDATE:  Yesterday morning I emailed “Jessica,” and basically said I knew it was inappropriate to be contacting her, I wanted to make sure she were okay, how sorry I was and let me know if there was anything I could do.  

Ten minutes later, she calls.  Something she never did.  We talked for a long time.  Some intense fighting went on after I left and apparently in the heat of the moment, he let it slip that he had also been fucking someone in one of his classes at a different studio (he also teaches yoga).  She told me that she already knew, but I’m not sure I buy it.  After the initial shock and fighting, she said things eventually turned civil and they had a real conversation about their relationship for the first time in years.  They were both unhappy.  They bolt felt they married too young.  The both felt unappreciated, undesired and that they married the wrong person.  They agreed they were going to separate.  Last night, he packed up and moved into his girlfriend’s house LESS THAN A MILE AWAY.

So I told Jessica, I can’t do this anymore.  That I was happy being her friend, being there through this shit, but I couldn’t sleep with her.  She asked if I was interested in dating after her divorce was finalized.  And here Reddit, is where I took your advice.  I thought about it, and I would have dated her after divorce was finalized.  But it wouldn’t have been serious for me (I would have been honest about that).  And it was NOT about the allure of the taboo being lost, it was about allowing this women a chance to recover from a fucked up situation that I had helped create.  So I told her I didn’t think it was a good idea, and that this was a time in her life where she needed to figure things out for herself.  I told her I would be grateful to be a friend and support mechanism, but not her lover.

So I don’t have any illusions that this makes up for the fact that I contributed to breaking up a family.  I wouldn’t say it’s a happy ending, just an inevitable ending that my own poor decisions put me in the middle of.


I’m sorry it happened.

I’m sorry for my part in it.

It’s not something I’ll forget or repeat.

1373900937.0,127,self.confession,1iccuy,I used to frequent a lot of massage parlors and also visit a lot of escorts(male and female),176,49,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1iccuy/i_used_to_frequent_a_lot_of_massage_parlors_and/,"Been bugging me for a long time and maybe actually writing it down will help me feel less guilty about it. When I was in my early 20's I used to go to a lot of the asian massage parlors (the ones with the stereotypical happy endings). It started off when I worked for this Japanese store owner and he offered to take me to one as a reward for my hard work. Long story short, I went and I liked it, a lot. So I started locating new parlors to visit and would go whenever I had free time. I happened to make a fair amount of money at the time so there was never an issue as far as affording the habit. And I preferred the parlors to actual girlfriends because I could go, do what I wanted and then leave. No obligation to date or hang out. So this left time for me to indulge in my hobbies like surfing, reading, video games...etc... Also, there was a feeling of excitement when i would go to a parlor(one of the reasons I visited different ones instead of the same over and over). I liked the feeling of anxiousness I would get when I would start the initial massage. Some of the places I went seemed like legit massage places. So there was always that question of what would happen (would the lady offer ""extras"" or end the massage). 

The massages eventually were not enough for me and I moved to looking for escorts to hook up with. I am also bi (no one knows this either so I guess part two to my confession) so I would meet and have sex with both male, shemale, and women escorts. I quickly took more of a liking to escorts since I could basically indulge in any type of fantasy, fetish or type of sex act I wanted. With massage parlors you are limited to touching, blowjob and then usually just missionary style sex, which are all great, but do get boring over time. It got to the point where i was usually spending somewhere around $1000 to $2000 a month just on massage parlors and escorts. None of my friends knew this and no one ever thought anything was up since I would also hook up with girls from clubs or bars when the chance arose. Weird enough, I became friends with a couple of the escorts and we will on occasion still email each other still to this day, more so just to see how we are each doing. 

I am not going to lie, I hate myself for doing these things.  I no longer do this and will never do it again as I am now married. I feel pretty disgusted with myself when i think back about all the wasted money and the types of things I did. In retrospect it seems like I was a totally different person.

1361673276.0,131,self.confession,194268,I've been sexting with my brother for months and he doesn't know it's me... but I think he's getting suspicious. ama,199,68,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/194268/ive_been_sexting_with_my_brother_for_months_and/,"About three months ago I thought it'd be funny for me (19, f) to reply to my brother's (22, m) OKCupid ad using a false account. Don't know why I did it. Never been attracted to him in that way or anything like that and the idea of incest is gross to me but I was in a weird mood. Also I was a bit drunk but that's another story.

I ended up putting together a whole fake profiled on OKCupid using some random pictures I found on the internet. In his profile he said he was looking for someone local so I even looked up neighborhoods near where he lives (he moved cross country years ago for college) and found an apartment building near him that I innocently claimed to live in on my profile. I must have spent over an hour creating the fake accounts (Yahoo mail, facebook, okcupid) before I sent him a brief message saying that I thought he was cute and that we should chat.

The next day I had tons of replies to my fake profile. I ignored them all except for the one from Kyle, my brother. All he said was that he liked some of the same bands that I did and he thought I was cute. But he also gave me his YIM id. 

Still thinking it was funny I began to chat with him using the fake YIM account I had made. I was a lot more aggressive with him than I ever am with guys. I must have overdone it because early on he accused me of being a bot or a marketer or something. Eventually he began to trust me, especially after I sent him more pictures of ""me"" (all downloaded from the internet). 

It became a fun little prank. Almost every night before bed we would chat and talk about our days and over time he began to flirt with me. He asked if I wanted to see any of his ""private pictures"". I said yes. I still have them. I can't believe Kyle would take pictures like that. I really can't believe I didn't delete them the second I saw what they were and end the whole thing, but I didn't. Instead what did I do? I sent him some ""private pictures"" back.

Yes. I took some nude photos of myself and sent them to him. I kept my face out of them of course. Even though I'm a bit skinnier and a lot taller than the girl whose image I used for my fake profiles he never questioned it. Instead he became even bolder and one thing led to another and we were having the dirtiest chat I'd ever experienced.

For weeks he begged to hear my voice. He constantly asked for my phone number but I told him I still didn't trust him enough to give away my personal information. One day he drew the line: if I wouldn't talk to him then he wasn't going to waste anymore time chatting with me.

We ended up using Google Chat. I kept my webcam aimed at my chest and made sure that I didn't show my face or hair. I also used my cutsey-little-voice and faked an accent (I had told him I was from Alabama for some reason). We began chatting like that all the time. The chats always led to him taking out his cock and him asking me to talk dirty to him. I watched Kyle, my own brother, jerk off on camera at least a dozen times as a result. 

I kept wanting to end it. I really really did but I was addicted. It got so bad that I was standing up my boyfriend sometimes just so I could go home and sext with my brother. I didn't want to break his heart: I had created his perfect girlfriend. She liked all the things he liked, she was kinky and into his kinks (even though some of them repelled me to be honest), and she was on the verge of leaving an abusive boyfriend. Once she did she swore that she would meet him.

All of those lies worked for awhile. But they're not working anymore. He's demanding to meet me in person. Just tonight he sent me an e-mail in which he basically said that if I didn't leave my fictional, abusive boyfriend or at least meet him for coffee that he didn't want to continue wasting his time with me.

I don't know what to do. Obviously I can't meet him and I can't tell him the truth about who I am either. How would I explain that? My biggest worry is that he has figured out he's being toyed with. I mean, I really don't think he suspects I'm behind all this but by the way he talks to me now I'm pretty sure he knows he's being played.

I feel really bad about this. Kyle is a good guy. It's just that what started off as a stupid little prank turned into a hole, then a deeper hole, then an even deeper one. I need to stop digging, I know, but I also need to figure out how to climb out of this hole without hurting Kyle or myself.

I'm married to a wonderful, sweet woman. I really do love her, even if I am an asshole. Unfortunately, she has a condition called vaginismus, which means that we can't have penetrative sex. I'm sure therapy would help her, but I can't afford that, and we can't seem to get anywhere with doctors. I am also scared to bring it up with her because I am afraid it would hurt her feelings... whenever we try to have penetrative sex and it hurts to much, she feels horrible, and I don't know how to comfort her.

I suppose the lack of sex got to me after a couple of years. I know, I'm a terrible fuck. Started out as fantasies, checking out a few girls at college, admiring them. Met a girl last semester, hung out with her a few times, smoked week, but I never made a move, just stayed friends. I met another girl, who was 19, last semester as well, and chatted her up quite a bit, flirted with her, etc. I stopped wearing my wedding ring. We exchanged numbers. I could tell she liked me, but at the last moment, before asking her out, I caved, told my wife about it, and cut off all communication with her.

Fast forward a few months and a new semester, and she is in one of my classes. Its hard not to notice her. Pretty rough. I text her, she doesn't answer, so I ask her about it after class and she says, ""Oh, I was busy."" I know when I am being rejected, so I say okay and make plans to end it right there. Except, in my wacko head, I decide to do something else. I text her that we should be friends with benefits, and there may be money in it for her if we do. We discuss it for a while and I give her the weekend to think about it.

Next week she says she will do it for the money, she wants a new laptop and tattoos and shit. So I drive to her dorm and pick her up, but before going anywhere, I park so that we can talk face to face about it. She ends up not wanting to do it, and I say goodbye, but then get mad and text her asking why she wasted my time, then I get mad at myself for being a fucking asshole/creep and text her I'll respect her decision and leave her alone.

I again confess everything to my wife and tell her she needs to divorce me. She tells me she loves me and that she won't give up on me. This woman is obviously way too good for an asshole like me.

A few weeks later I get another text. She says she has gone on a shopping spree for the first time in forever and spent all of her money and needs more to go on some trips this summer. A few days later I pick her up and take her to our apartment while my wife is at work. I say I am moving in and we have sex in a spare room on the floor- I hid everything that showed I was married, pictures, etc., that she could see coming in. Afterwards I immediately felt like shit. I gave her $100 and drove home in silence. When I dropped her off it was a real movie moment, raining, empty parking lot, watching her walk back to her dorm, and I thought about the cute smile she had from a few months prior when we used to flirt--its not that I am in love with her or anything, but I felt like a total creepy ass fucking dick for actually coercing this girl with money into selling her body for sex. I just hope it doesn't leave her with issues for life.

I'm aware of how narcissistic and selfish my actions are. I'm also aware that I should tell my wife, but I haven't, and I don't know that I will. I do want to salvage our marriage, but I also know that, at times, I'm a horny fuck. Also, this whole episode has brought out a side of me that I don't exactly like: domineering, coercive, manipulative. I'm aware that part of the decision was on her part, but honestly, she isn't exactly that bright of a young girl, and I feel as if the majority of the blame falls on me.

UPDATE: Dude who skipped town for two years because he's in love with his best male friend. ,172,45,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18pe7o/hopeful_update_dude_who_skipped_town_for_two/,"Here's the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/184lxm/i_abandoned_my_best_friend_of_seven_years_and_all/

So here's what I've learned about how my best friend/lover has been doing since I skipped town for almost two years after cutting off contact with him and all of my other friends:  

I did talk to my brother a few nights ago and asked him casually what Nick had been up to, and he said he's been riding a lot and working at the stables and volunteering at the animal shelter. I also know he's been hunting with my brother. He hasn't dated and my brother said he won't go out drinking. Too busy ""playing Dr. Dolittle"" he says. I asked if he was upset when I left and my brother laughed and said, ""What do *you* think?""

So yeah. That's what I've got to work with. Upon my disappearance, my best friend/boyfriend has apparently taken up the hobby of bottlefeeding kittens when he's not mucking stables, sitting in a tree stand, or out riding by himself. 

I don't even know what to do with that information. He sounds completely withdrawn. I mean, he was always an introverted guy - we're actually both pretty quiet in person, but he's shy whereas I guess I'm just more stoic. So most people probably wouldn't even notice much of a difference, but that's some hardcore solitude even for him. At least he's not with anyone, so that's one thing I don't have to worry about.

In any case, I pushed back my trip home until next weekend, so I could send him a letter. I already shocked him once by just disappearing into thin air, I don't think it's fair to do it twice by just showing up out of nowhere. So I wrote this letter on quality paper, sealed with red wax, and I'm going to put it in overnight priority mail Monday in a separate envelope so I don't have to put his address on the actual letter itself, just his name. 

Here it is: 

**Nick,**

**I am the sorriest son of a bitch alive. I left because I was afraid, but there's no excuse for what I did. I have no right to ask your forgiveness, but at this point I have no choice either. I was lost without you.** 

**I'm planning on a visit next weekend. I want to see you when I do, so we can talk and you can look into my eyes and know what I'm telling you is true. I'm done running. There's no home for me outside of your arms, and I don't care who knows about it. I'd give anything to hear you say my name.**

**I don't expect you to accept my apology based on one visit, but I'd have you know if you'll even consider forgiving me a little, I am prepared to move back home in order to grovel my way back into your good graces on a more daily basis.** 

~~**I'm putting my heart in your hands. You did the same for me once and I fucked it up big time. Here's your chance to get me back, one way or the other. I want to be with you, and I'll spend two years for every week I was gone making it up to you.**~~ 

~~**I still want us to honeymoon in Amsterdam and grow old with too many dogs and argue about what kind of movies to watch at night. Tell me you'll at least still consider it.**~~ 

~~**I love you, I love you, I love you. Feel free to xerox this letter and staple it to every telephone pole in ten miles, I don't give a damn who knows.**~~ 

**I'll come by and find you. Please don't turn me away when I do.** 

**I love you.**

**Tobias**

EDIT: Thanks for all the well wishes, I am going to tweak this letter a little bit according to some suggestions I've received, it's just my first draft. Consensus is that it needs to be more apologetic, less mushy. Post office is closed tomorrow anyway. 

EDIT2: Forgot to mention, the reason I'm writing him a love letter is because I wrote him one once before, back before we started to get serious. I was too shy to tell him how I felt to his face, so I wrote a letter and left it under his pillow. I was hoping seeing another one would bring up sweet memories for him of us.

I was up late doing laundry in my dorm. It was around 3 AM. I walked by the main door, and there was a guy waiting outside. It was about 10 degrees that night, and he was cold and was (politely) asking if I could open the door for him. Our dorm has rules - never let anyone in if they look unfamiliar to you. But I knew this guy. I had seen him around in my dorm a few times, but had never spoken to him. 

I let him in. We got on the elevator together. He got off on the seventh floor, turned around to thank me for letting him in, then went off on his way. The seventh floor in my dorm is strictly all girls (odd-numbered floors are girls, even-numbered are boys), but I just assumed he was going to see his girlfriend or something. I didn't think of it at all. 

I finally go to bed and wake up a few hours later to the sound of police cars, ambulances, and shouting people in my hallway. I go out and investigate, and my RA is saying that there has been an incident a few floors below us, and we couldn't leave until everything was sorted out.  The next day we discover that a girl on the seventh floor was beaten so badly that she had to go to the hospital by her ex-boyfriend. She had a restraining order against him. He apparently tried to choke her and rape her, but her roommate was able to keep him off. 

Immediately, I told my RA that I had let him in, unaware that he was going to do what he did. I didn't think. The director of housing was involved, but he pretty much just said that it was a mistake, and he would have probably gotten in anyway. He didn't blame me. 

But I blame myself. It's my fault. It's selfish to think that way, but it's true. If it wasn't for me, she wouldn't be in the situation that she was in. 

To the girl on the seventh floor, I'm so sorry. I wish I could take your place. I can't even imagine what you must be feeling right now. I'm so fucking sorry.

When I was a freshman in high school I made friends with many of the seniors and their friends who had graduated. I became very close to one guy in particular who I will call J.
J and I spent a lot of time together and he eventually told me he liked me. He was 19 at the time and I had a boyfriend. He flirted with me quite a bit, touching my shoulders and back, telling me he wished I was single. I didn't think much of it at the time but then he started to share personal info unsolicited like that he was a virgin and he had thought about me giving him head. One night he called me while he was masturbating.

His attention to me died down for a while and I borrowed a case of his CDs to move to my iTunes during the summer. I texted him to let them know I was done with them and he came to pick them up. He walked 6 miles in the summer while I was home alone to pick them up.

When he got there, we talked for a few minutes and then he started kissing me. I immediately froze, I didn't know what to do. He made me do things to him. I couldn't move and talk out of fear and confusion. It wasn't until he started anally raping me without protection or preparation that I said anything. I yelled no at him, I told him to stop, I said don't (He would later tell me he thought I had said ""no don't stop"" and was enjoying it). He didn't until he heard a car door slam and assumed it was my mother.

It wasn't long before it got out. My best friend told everybody at her summer camp without my permission. My boyfriend and I started receiving emails, texts, and phone calls harassing me and asking intimate details about how good a lay I was and what certain parts of my body looked like. My boyfriend became didn't believe me and threatened to hit me and called me a whore. Keep in mind I am 14.

The man who would become my husband got roped in when my boyfriend went to my rapist's house and interrogated him and recorded the conversation, having my future husband hide the recorder in his pocket. He was a stranger to me at the time and my boyfriend dragged him into my business. My boyfriend made me listen to the interrogation and then take the recorder home with me, furthering my emotional trauma. I still have the recorder in a box, with the conversation still on it.

My mother told me that nobody would ever believe me and didn't take me to the doctor, even though I had suffered some rectal damage and was bleeding intermittently (to this day I still do). For weeks I hoped J had been telling the truth about being a virgin and did not give me any disease.

Eventually, it died down but my reputation as a whore and an easy lay was set in stone, no matter how much I told people it wasn't consensual. Everybody knew what had happened to me and nobody did anything. In fact, most of them thought I deserved it or thought I was lying.

It's been 8 years and I am still unable to have anal sex. I went to the movies to see Girl With The Dragon Tattoo before reading the book and I had a panic attack and had to leave during the rap and shower scenes. I have nightmares about it and scream at my husband when he touches my ass without my permission. I don't know if I will ever get over it.

1376068680.0,123,self.confession,1k1bzt,Pretty much only slept with hookers,180,57,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1k1bzt/pretty_much_only_slept_with_hookers/,"Where do I begin? Firstly, the title is a mild embellishment, I haven't only had sex with hookers. 

In fact I've had sex with 5 girls during my teens, since then I've slept with two other women in my twenties. I'm now 26, turning 27 in two months.

This story begins with a father and son. My mother and father divorced shortly after I was born, I won't get into any specific details, but my father lived quite far away from me. I never really hated my Dad, nor did I really love him either. Distance was always a big factor, he lived in another country.

I visited him infrequently, once a year when Mom would pack our bags and send my brother, my sister and I over to Hong Kong (Not actually Hong Kong, but another big South East Asian city). One school holidays when I was 18, I went over to spend some time with my Dad and one night he took me out to a KTV. It's similar to hostess bars in Japan, the focus is more on Karaoke and the intent is much more clear.

So we're in this small, smoky room singing Karaoke with a few of my Father's business associates surrounded by some of the most buxom, absolutely drop dead gorgeous women. I can't begin to describe the kind of beauty some of these women possessed. Many of us are used to the almost androgynous shape of Asian women in general, the cute, petite girls who would do anything for you. 

Not these women. Oh god, not these women. Almost every single one of them had picture perfect hourglass figures, soft without a single ounce of extra fat, and the kind of distinctly feminine figures that are so idolised manifest in the flesh. They were absolutely smoking hot. 

It seemed strange at first, why were all of these women here? More importantly, absolutely stunning women? My father explained the concept of hostess bars to me, and on the surface of things it seemed completely innocent. I knew Japanese history, I knew about Geishas!

So I sat down, had a few drinks and started to talk to some of the women. Apparently they were fresh from Mongolia, come to see the sights of HK. We sang some songs, smoked and drank and had a good time for about an hour.

After a while I started questioning the scenario a bit, started probing my Dad and I remember him telling me that they're basically hookers.

....what?

I felt incredibly indignified by the whole thing. How could someone let themselves sink so low that they would *pay* for sex? All hookers are dirty, stinking, diseased tramps mind you. They're passed around and used for whatever purpose some random, stinking fat man wants. Sex is free! Why would you need to pay for it? Why would you need to. I got up and procceeded to storm out the room, followed closely by the mistress and one of her entourage. 

""Are you angry? Come you let this girl give you blowjob"". The girl who followed her was in a tiny red sequined, glittery dress, about 5'6"", probably early twenties if not younger and again, just absolutely gorgeous. I froze for a second, doubt creeped across my mind. Here's this incredibly attractive woman standing before me, nodding her head and agreeing that she would fufill any of my sexual desires.

No chance. My moral compass was too strict. Not today, not ever. I said no and walked off.

""What are you, gay?"" The mistress taunted as I slammed the door open.

I walked out into the balmy night and was just angry at the whole situation. MY father was married, how could he do this? Why would he do this? Marriage is life long fidelity, this is why Mom divorced him!

So I grabbed a cab and went back to his apartment. When I got there, I called up my former girlfriend at the time and explained the situation. She was from this particular city, and she told me that it was more or less normal and this kind of thing happens frequently. She didn't even have a major problem with it.

What the fuck is wrong with everyone?!?! Christ this city is fucked! The inhabitants are all fucked is what they are.

Anyways, I kept a lot hidden from my Dad. The next day he asked me if I was disgusted by the whole thing. ""I'm not disgusted by it"". He had no real idea how I felt about the whole thing, it wasn't disgust, it was just plain and utterly pathetic to me. I felt he was pathetic for paying for sex.

We didn't visit the hostess bar again that trip.

Skip forward a couple of months, I'm at a mates house. We decide to go the Casino and spend a bit of cash. Mind you, at this time, we were still all pretty thrilled with the idea that we can now drink, gamble, smoke (legally) and generally act like law-abiding adults. Afterwards, it struck me.

I don't know why, but I wanted to have sex and I wanted it now. I was focused, my intentions were clear, there was no doubt I would fuck the next living thing that approached me, I was so incredibly horny and the only thing that would satiete my libido was sex with a live woman. I started talking about it to my mates, and one of my more slightly experienced friends suggests we go to a brothel (brothels are legal where I live). 

OK fine, fuck it, let's do it. We ended up going to a dingy and noticeable brothel on a main st. I had passed this place probably a few times but never noticed the huge glowing pink heart sign. The kind of cheesy and tacky symbol you would find in a local porn shop. 

A host greeted us and ushered us into a lounge with a few TV's broadcasting a bad porno. The ladies came in one by one and introduced themselves. They were all fat, old and well beyond their primes. However, there was one young girl who caught my eye. Blonde, average looking and petite, she seemed willing so I took her. My mates didn't seem fussed and took the first girls that came. I paid the host, I took her off into a room and I fucked her.
No strings, no bullshit, just sex.I couldn't cum, I don't know why. To this day I still question why. Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe I was nervous, maybe it was the fact that I was doing the very thing I despised my father for doing. It didn't matter. I finished myself off and she didn't really have a problem with that. I left, went back to my friends house and got completely blazed.

Since then I went back to the same brothel I think three or four times in the same year.

After that, it became the norm. I honestly didn't think that much of it at the time. It seemed logical, reasonable, and most of my expectations were met with a very surreal reality.

I spent a few months working for my Dad and man, would we party. We went to this *literal* underground club that was full of absolutely gorgeous women. Not a KTV. Not a hostess bar. THis was a club and there was only one reason that anyone went there.
It was incredibly exclusive, they bounced guys who were absolutely rolling in cash, cash wasn't the main selling point. You had to be part of a network, a particular network open to particular people. Nothing criminal or shady, let's just leave it that there
are more powerful interests in this world, and for the longest time I didn't believe this kind of stuff happened. It does, and I was there first hand with a golden ticket.

Again, the girls were absolutely gorgeous, it wasn't just Mongolians though, it was every single girl you could imagine from every country in the world. This particular country (you could even call it a City, a State even) my Dad resides in is
incredibly notorious for offering very lucrative, highly commoditised prositution. Both buyer and seller. It is a city of pure economy and everything has a price.

Russians, Brazillians, South Americans, Eastern Europeans. There's a lot of porn out there with these absolutely stunning beauties, uncovered hidden treasures that porn producers seem to attract. You don't see it as often these days, but you catch it sometimes from films in the early 00's 
and the late 90's. Girls who could, or should, be models. 

And there's a whole underground club full of them, willing and absolutely capable. It wasn't so much prostitution in the strictest, dirtiest, media programmed sense of the word. These were professionals all smoking hot and young and by god were they god at what they did. I paid them well and they was barely any drama.

I would have sex with an Amazonian Brazillian Goddess one night, a more gentle and steadfast Russian girl another night. As a 22 year old guy, I was having almost every single one of my fantasies fufilled by these young nymphettes. Threesomes? Done. Cum on her face? Done. Cum swapping? Done. It was fucking
intense, I couldn't believe the type of stuff I could get away with. I'm still, to this day, genuinely surprised I haven't caught a single STD or STI. Fuck my only real regret was that I wasn't more safe about it. It was hard not to. I kept escalating. I started off just having sex with them, 
then one night I asked a 36-24-36 Latino if she would blow me without a condom. SHe was hesitant at first, but I produced a few greenbacks and all doubt disappeared.

My only fear, my only real anxiety about this situation was that perhaps they were being manipulated into this by some gangster types. Never the case as it were. It might happen, but not to these particular escorts. They were getting paid the equivalent of $1000-2000 USD per hour. Maybe two, three guys a night, for two or three hours each.
Do the math. They *wanted* to come and why blame them? One particular woman I became friends with had managed to buy herself a half-million dollar apartment after only working for six months. Six months and she already had real estate. It wasn't just all from hooking either, she got an incredible amount of gifts and other graft (although not technically)
from a few of her more attached customers.

The boundaries in relationships became completely blurred. I had to force myself not to get attached. As someone who considered himself a one girl type of guy, it was difficult to say the least. 

Anyways, an incredible experience to say the least. After about 4 months my Dad and I had a falling out and I decided to move back home. 

At this point in the story, including the time spent in this particular city, I had slept with over 25 prostitutes. I hadn't actually been in any type of relationship since I was 19 and I was now turning 23.

I haven't and still haven't been in an actual proper long term relationship. After this, this is when it started to get a little seedy. From this incredibly shiny and glamorous lifestyle I was now in a small town with some of the most conservative, button-down people I had ever met.

Anyways, I still continued to go to brothels, although these ones, the girls were never quite as good. Most of them were old, weathered, seen one too many Johns. Most of them shouldn't have been there, and if it was any major
city in the world, they wouldn't. Continue on I did though, and I would have sex with the occassionally good looking one who was still young or at least attractive.

Then shit came crashing down. My Mom died (Very quickly) of cancer, and it was the worst type of cancer. The type where all hope is truly lost, where you watch in complete powerlessness as they slowly wither and die in front of you. It was gruesome, disgusting, bloody and painful.
I started failing at University, badly. She died and for a brief moment, I was both relieved that she had finally died, and comforted by the fact that I could be vulnerable and people held that in some kind of respect.
 
I took a trip to another Asian country, this one could be thought of as effecient, neat, orderly and futuristic. I went on a quest, sspending time travelling around the country. The fucked up thing was, I spent so much time in these backpackers, hostels and other places, where the girls were all willing and completely ready to be taken.
But I never did. I didn't want to. I finally mustered up enough game to get a girl into bed, but I just could not perform. I was mildly drunk, but it was less about being drunk and more about the fact that I was exposed.

It was different. She was a living, breathing person. Someone who had dreams, who had a family, someone who wanted to be loved. She jusst wanted sex too, there's no doubt in my mind. But something irrevocably changed within me. I could no longer live out my fantasies, it wasn't just a one person show anymore, and let's face it, up until this
point it was completely a one-person show. 

It's different when your with a prositute, hooker, escort whatever. There's no emotional output, and if there is, it's well scripted and rehearsed. They're subservient, they let you take control without having to claim it and most importantly, you know you are anonymous. It doesn't matter how or why you like what you like, there's no
emotional anchor there. It's sex and it's simply sex.

Anyways, I couldn't fuck her.

Fast forward, it's now two years since my Mom died, we had to sell her house, I'm living in a sharehouse I don't want to be in (I got kicked out of my sisters house) I'm broke as fuck with no real networks in a town I really don't want to be in. 

I decided to go to a brothel a couple of months ago. There were no women I wanted to fuck, but I decided to take the best looking one, who was probably early 30's, misshapen and a little gross. I fucked her anyway, because fuck, it doesn't matter how I feel right? All that matters is that I'm a guy who wants to fuck.
That's apparently the one thing that's ever mattered with sex. Guys are mindless fucking robots who just want to have sex, and girls are there simply to reciprocate that.

It was an awkward and weird experience. For the first time in my life I realised it wasn't all about sex. And here I was trying to make myself cum to this old, fat hooker just because I felt I needed to. 
I needed to fufill that fantasy, no matter the cost.

I felt dirty, and no matter how hard I scrubbed I couldn't wash away that dirty feeling. I was convinced I had crabs. I went to the doctor, completely clean bill of health, not a single thing wrong with me. For a few weeks it felt like there was something terribly wrong. It was
probably less to do with the sex, and more to do with what was happening with my life. Regardless, I felt dirty for weeks.

So there you have it. In the course of 8 years I've slept with about 50 women, 40 of them prostitutes. I need to tell this to somebody, anybody. It probably has less significance than I give it. It's important that someone knows, if even that one person that's gotten to the end of this post.

I think it's just time to do something other than let this fester in my head, like it has been for most of my life. I'm tired of being ashamed. I have never admitted this to anyone, and started to compose a text message to my SO of 4 years, figured I would start here instead.

But apparently I'm still ashamed enough to create a new account just to post this.


Before you read any further, I'm going to give you a heads up, that I describe more than a few 'graphic' encounters with my abuser, and they are all... not censored. This is what really happened. It makes me squeamish just to read over it to post it, and I, a grown man, definitely teared up a few times while typing this up. The thing that makes me the most angry is, my earliest 'clear' memories are of this. These events are what I remember of my childhood. fuck.


One last thing, I'm on a lot of different drugs right now, and when i started thinking about this at 2am. Blame all mistakes on narcotics and alcohol.


I am a mid twenties white male, employed, have a somewhat serious relationship with a woman I've loved for years.


I grew up in a really small town outside of detroit. One stoplight, everyone knew everyone. 


I had a couple friends when I was little, but this town was small and mostly filled with old people, then when I was 6, a new family moved into the neighborhood. They had a son, who became the 'cool older kid'.IIRC, he was 13 when we started being friends. I only remember that I was six years old because I remember having a birthday party a few weeks prior with a big obnoxious 6 in icing. I wanted donuts instead of cake. I was disapoint.


He and I hung out constantly and did random destructive shit together in the woods and whatnot. My parents didn't care very much because he was older and I guess seemed trustworthy. Even looking back as an adult, I could see why he would be deemed harmless, normal looking suburban kid, sports, and all that. 

We had been friends for what I would estimate a couple weeks when we were wandering around in the woods close to my house.

The conversation is very vague to me because it's been so long, but I distinctly remember him mentioning something about what I now know as pornography. 

He gave the best description he could on the topics about how what boys did to girls when they were older. He started talking nonstop about how incredibly good it felt. I didn't have a fucking clue what he was talking about, but I agreed. I was with the cool kid.


I remember feeling  uncomfortable with what he was talking about, but I was more afraid he wouldn't want to hangout with me anymore if I seemed like I was too young and not cool enough talk about grown up things. I didnt want to sound naive or dumb. So I went along with the porn discussions, and the countless sexually charged conversations about finally getting a girl. I just agreed and repeated, I wanted to be cool too. 


I tried to keep up with his one-sided conversation about sex. For some reason, I think that I already had a general idea that babies came from naked adults doing naked things together. I mostly just listened to him, hearing plenty of words for genitals that I had never heard before in my life, much less understood at all. I remember hearing the word ""pussy"" and thinking it was such a dirty sounding name for a body part. It's weird how such a dumb word can stick to a persons memory for all these years. It was my first real exposure to that side of the world.


Maybe a week later, we were hanging out on my parents property. there was an older beat up Oldsmobile in the far back of the lot. We decide to play ""cops and robbers"" in/on/around the car. 



He had been talking more and more about what I considered ""dirty stuff"". Stuff that I really had no desire to talk about, not that I knew what it was. My main interest at the time was racing bikes and cartoons. I couldn't understand at that time why all he seemed to think and talk about was sexually related. 


  We ended up in the backseat of the car shooting at the imaginary robbers.

This is part I warned you not to read.

This old Oldsmobile had folding back seats that opened into the trunk. I remember as I was shooting at imaginary robbers, seeing my dad on the riding mower, mowing this ridiculously large yard we had. As we were dodging pretend bullets, he pulls down the folding backseat and suggests we take cover in the trunk for a while to hang out. I was in the heat of the moment, trying to save my money from robbers, we climb in, and it is not a large trunk. 


Completely off the topic of this epic firefight that we were involved in, he asked me if I had 'french tounged' a girl yet. I had an idea of what a french kiss was, but no expierence.


I remember him grabbing my shoulders,pinning me against the wheel well, and trying to open mouth kissing me. i just kind of sat motionless while he did his thing. I had no room to go anywhere in the trunk, and he started sort of rubbing/dryhumping me.  The amount of weird going on in my 6 year old mind was off the charts. My young mind had just assumed this was some kind of normality. That part is sketchy, I'm sure I could have wriggled out of there and told an adult, but I didn't. I was sure that I would get in trouble for this sort of thing.  I wanted to impress my new friend, and I was definitely not clear on what was going on here. I had figured out that is was some kind of adult thing. Being six years old was crazy. 

When he finally pulled off of my face, I very innocently asked him what that was, and if we should be doing it, and if that made us ""gay"". I was shocked from what just happened, and slightly disgusted. He heard the digust in my voice, and it was the first of many times I saw his anger.

His face told me that I had insulted him, but then he told me, ""It's fine, we are just practicing for girls. Its our secret that you can't tell anyone"". I blindly believe him, because to me, he's the cool, smart older kid who wanted to be my friend. 

A few days later, we were playing with legos in my room, and it turned into a ""show me yours, I'll show you mine"" type of thing, at his suggestion.

I was so fucking confused at that moment. I knew this was all wrong, my parents gave me the 'private parts' talk. I thought that I was going to be in deep shit for this, if I told them. He just kept pressuring me telling no one would know, ""our secret"" ect. I started to refuse. I was too embarrassed. 


Thats when the threats started. Blackmail really. He berated me, and told me he was going to tell my parents and get me in trouble. When he started to leave and tell me he wasn't my friend anymore, I gave in. About a minute later my father called me for dinner or something. I remember the fear of getting found out for what just happened.

The next he came over it was easier for him to get to the perverted goal of his, and he already knew what combination of words to use to shame me into taking my clothes off. He just strolled in the house, told me to get naked, I protested for second, then thought better of it.I knew he would probably start asking and begging until resorted to threats. At this point, we had't done anything too sexual with each other, but I already had the vibe that he was kind of sketchy, I knew to fear this kid.


the whole day he kept making weird comments about how he was going to make me feel good, I was so fucking confused. Eventually we ended up at his house (he had a pool, lived a block away, and my parents trusted him), and he got me alone. We went swimming for a while, then inside to play video games. He tried positive reinforcement and bribes to get me naked didn't work, he pulled out his trusted threatdown, which worked. I felt so embarassed while I was pulling down my pants in front of someone. I knew this was wrong. I had my eyes closed because I was so humiliated. I stood there for a few seconds, eyes still squinted shut, and suddenly I felt a hand on my genitals. I opened my eyes wide, saw what was happening. He proceeded to give me oral. I had no idea what he was doing, or that this was a ""thing"",  I never felt anything like that before. He stops after maybe five seconds, and tells me, ""your turn"". I realized what he was asking me to do, and it scared the shit out of me. I knew that this wasn't normal by this point, but I felt like he had me trapped, and a part of me wanted him to continue, even though I knew it was wrong. A part of me is very scared, because this unfamiliar territory for a 6 year old., but I still couldn't understand what exactly was going on. and I wasn't sure if that is something I wanted to do. It seemed icky.

I said ""do I have to""?  He got pretty mad and calling me names and threatening to tell on me. I plead with him for him not to tell my parents.I start crying, thinking I was going to be in huge trouble. He tells me that I have do this or he will tell on me. He grabbed my shoulders and pushed me down. When I looked up, he was pulling his penis out. I have never been that scared, or shocked. He was still kind of underdeveloped, but definitetly bigger than me, and had started to grow pubic hair. He gripped the back of my head and forced me onto him. He didn't let go of my hair the whole time, i was trying to cry or say stop but he just went in as far as he could, starting to choke me. He yells that I bit him. More threats. 

After telling me stop crying, he pulled my head back into place, after a few minutes of him basically skull fucking me(I recall the top of my mouth and throat being sore and bruised the next day), I felt him swell up and pulse in me, followed by him forcing himself all the way in, choking me and sending body fluids out of my nose. I will never forget the smug fucking look on his face when that happened. His mood changed instantly after orgasm. He would be not such an asshole to me, occasionally even said sorry, or showed some remorse. This never lasted though. 

For the next two years, from the time I was 6 to 8 years old, this happened almost everyday. The most confusing part of all this, and easily the hardest to admit, is that sometimes, he performed oral sex on me, and being that young, I couldnt stop the physical response. I still feel like I deserved it, because I slightly enjoyed that part of our encounters. I hated the rest.


 I started hating the sight of seeing him coming up the front steps to my house, and knowing what I was going to have to do to him. At this point, he had pretty much stopped having interest in me, other than stopping at my house for ten or fifteen minutes a couple times a week, getting what he came for and leaving.


I still told myself that I had iniated this. I reminded myself that he treatened to ""out me"" in front of all my friends and parents. I was fucking terrified most of the time. After he left my house, usually I would head down to the kitchen for something to drink to get any foul tastes out of my mouth. My worst fear was my family somehow realizing what I had been doing. Living with that shame as a child is something I would never wish upon anyone. 


It still got worse though. He came over to play a N64 game or something. My parents left for the grocery store, assured I'd be fine with the older neighbor boy. I never even gave them the opprotunity to even think something was up. I had made a promise to the older kid that wouldnt tell anyone. He told me I'd go to a foster home. I thought that what was happening between the two of us would get me in just as much trouble. I was positive that getting caught naked with other kids would land me in more trouble than anything else. He instilled this into me, made threats, ect ect.


After my parents leave, we run up to my room, because he wanted ""play a new different game"".

He made me lay naked on the floor, on my stomach. I'm not sure if its just 20/20 hindsight, or 8 year old me knew something was about to happen. I remember staring at a trim board along the floor while I was wondering what was about to happen. 

He tried unsuccessfully for what seemed like hours to get himself to fit into me, and he was already very mature. I felt like the pressure was pressing on my eyeballs. I was being constantly yelled at for being at the wrong angle, or being too loud.

I was 8 at this time and he was 15.

It did not stop him from trying, I was crying and bleeding, he was getting pissed. He pinned me down, and tried to hulksmash his way into my body. Intense pain. I pull away super quick. I'm still crying and begging and clutching the now damaged bit of my brown eye. He struck me with an open fist and told me to quit crying. He said he was sorry after he was done about 5 minutes later.He tried to ""make up for it"" but I was enormously shaken up by getting hit. 

He tried this for about a month, then figured out how  lube works one day, and he didn't leave me alone for a week. Being constantly threatened with humiliation and violence made me just take it. I was still assuming that I was just as much in the wrong. He made sure of that.

He traumatized my nethers until i was sure I was going to die. He would force me to give him oral for a few days until I healed up. 


He was your classic predator. He made promises, and when he got what he really wanted, he would threaten to tell people what was going on. He constantly instilled into me that everything that we were doing was something that I wanted. He told me numerous times that this was my doing.
I honestly thought that I would go to jail for this. 


This continuted until I moved out of state when I was 11. I always had what happened in the back of my mind, but the guilt mentality had set in. I was still hearing his voice taunting me about it. I was still thinking that what had happened between us was mutual. for the next ten years I was convinced that nothing that he did were really crimes. I told myself that I had asked for this. I blocked it out, and as I said at the top, this is the first time I've even talked about it. Nobody knows about it, it will stay that way, hopefully. While drunk, I almost told my SO, but I couldnt get the words out.

It wasn't until I was around 21 or 22, that I realized that nothing that happened between him an I was mutual. He coerced me into fooling around, and raped me, violently, hundreds of times over the span of four years. Luckily no permanent injuries or scars.

It's also very clear to me now that he was probably abused in the exact same manner that I was. I still hate him for it.


TL;DR   I spent my childhood being used as a cum rag by a teenage boy who was probably abused himself, never told anybody about it.

I've never ""finished"" while having sex and I'm starting to worry about it.

I'm afraid that I've actually become good at faking. So good, in fact, that a girl I was dating for almost a year (and who took my virginity) called me when her period was late last summer (pregnancy scare.)

Background: I'm definitely straight, or at the least on the straight side of bi. I'm into straight porn, and have completed mutual masturbation with partners, I have no trouble getting aroused. 

I had wanted to have sex for the longest time, and after a few relations that went to 3rd base, I finally had a chance to do the thing. I don't remember feeling anything.  without going into detail, I ended up going at it for about an hour and then rolling off because i knew I wasn't finishing.

I never told her that I hadn't finished that night, not even when she called concerned that she was possibly pregnant. I feel bad for lying, but I feel worse for possibly having to fake with every woman that I'm with (been with another since, and no luck.)

I'm on the confession board because I'm ashamed of even having this problem. I've hinted at it with friends, and have been searching for answers. What kills me though, is memories of partners looking me in my eye during the act and asking if I'm close.  Every time, I see this pleading look and feel like I'm somehow disappointing them.

Confession over.

Update 5-15-13
I had a chance to come clean recently, and took it. Apparently the girls had a sneaking suspicion I wasn't finishing, and worried about things like not being tight enough. They, like many of the comments here, suggested that the problem may be in my masturbation. The second suggested that maybe my equipment was too big (I doubt it.)

While I'm resistant to think that the problem lies with me, its easier to work on me than to work on others.

We spent every single day together from the moment we got together junior year until I broke it off with him shortly after I graduated.

He was madly in love with me. Wanted to get married, was planning our future, you know the whole shebang (His family purchased land adjoining theirs with a house on it for us my senior year). We lived in a very small town in the middle of nowhere, in my mind I knew I was never happy with him but he was the best I was ever going to do because I felt stuck forever. I went along with and even came up with future scenarios in our romance. Everyone encouraged us to be together because we ""worked so well as a couple."" My friends loved him, my mother, everyone. He was a genuinely good, loving and helpful person.

Over the course of our relationship there were a lot of firsts. He lost his virginity. I learned how to cheat on a partner. He found his first love. I learned how to lie really well. I know, I sound like an utter villain but I was still a selfish child. I figured I'd get all this ""fun"" out of my veins and I'd settle down with good ole dependable Dave as soon as I graduated and that's that. I also made the stupid mistake of changing my life plans, out of guilt. I planned to fly far, far away to my magical dream college and live a new life in some awesome city. I worked my tail off to have a stellar record to do so. During our time together, Dave convinced me that he couldn't possibly live without me. Out of guilt, unwanted heartbreak, uncertainty of the future he managed to make me compromise my dreams around 3 times until I wound up agreeing to go to a school just an hour drive away.

Graduation rolled around and I spent the summer with some family in another state. There I met a ton of new people. I looked at life a total different way and grew more in those couple months than I ever did in my small town. I realized I didn't have to damn myself to a life of ""settling."" I didn't feel smothered anymore by the prospect of my future. No isolated farm life, no having kids because I'd feel pressured to (I never want kids.), nothing. There was really someone out in the world for me and Dave wasn't it. I broke it off with him and (shortening this part) we yo-yo'd for a while being together and apart for a brief period.

After we officially were apart, I'd hear stories of how crushed he was. He would have taken me back in a second, for so many years after that. I talked to him once or twice as time went on. He'd talk to me in confidence, telling me things like ""I have to think about you when I sleep with my girlfriend so I can get off. Please don't tell anyone."" and that he will never get over me etc. Even 4 years down the line, someone asked where I was at a party and Dave's brother shushed that person making sure Dave didn't even hear my name mentioned because he ""doesn't want to take Dave down that road again.""

Fastforward to recently, I was informed that Dave died in an accident. All of my friends were really shook up about it. They all still live back in our small area. They never moved on. I, however, haven't gone back in I think around 10 years. He never crosses my mind, yet since we dated for so long, everyone expected me to be heartbroken. They only remember Dave dwelling on me so much, for so long that's the image they have of me. A girl, frozen in time, still around Dave and living in their world. They expected a reaction like theirs. In reality, I didn't give a god damn. Yes, he died, that's really too bad. For me, it was like reading the obituary of a random person in the paper when I saw the emails come in. No feeling, just slight notice and a shrug.

I guess that sort of makes me sound really heartless. I look like the demon cheater with no respect for the dead but honestly he was just a blip in the radar of an otherwise super exciting, amazing life. I don't feel bad for letting go and moving on. I grew up, I saw the world. He died, that sucks, oh well.


**TL;DR I treated a faithful, loving person like dump during our time together. He never, ever got over me and died at a young age.**

**Edit:** Adding some facts for clarification. He died 10 years after us being together. Not a week later. Not a year. He had ample time to move on but, for whatever choice he made in his life, did not.
This relationship took place -during- high school. We weren't adults and didn't live together. I did not bone a bunch of dudes behind his back, I kissed a few people. That was the extent of the cheating. We were teenagers.

**Edit 2:** I did not go on to live of life of no feeling, constant cheating and stomping on other people. He was the only guy I ever cheated on. I am not a sociopath. I didn't keep doing things like this later on in my years. I care deeply things and people around me, heck you may choke on your cheerios but I even cared about him. When I talked about ""yo-yo'ing"" in the post I shortened out the parts about him -stalking- me, hounding me to get back together, making sure he was constantly around every where I went. That and the endless hours and hours of weeping, fighting, yelling and begging phone calls and talks he pushed on me wanting to get back together. I left this out before, but looking at the replies made me change my decision to leave it out.

NOTE: I did not include how much pressure he put on me to get married. How the house his parents bought was HIS plan (I had no inkling of it.) and was given to me in a very public way. Along with other expensive, publicly given presents before that. Imagine how you feel about women who turn down public proposals? Your immediate thought might be ""What a bitch, sucks for that guy."" but never think about how the woman feels about getting married. They just assume she wants to, and if not--that's not right fuck her. I was horrified at the increasing obligation I felt to stay with him. When I'd say I wanted to leave, to my friends, they'd scoff and say how ""good"" I had it and that I should just stay because it was the right thing to do given how much he ""invested"" in me. Even my mom yelled at me once for telling her I didn't want to be with him anymore. I was timid back then and was raised that the man/parent is always right, that's just how people are in corn country. I know that's not an excuse, but that doesn't change the fact it's the mindset I was raised in and I 100% believed there would be some kind of dire consequence of leaving him. I had huge pressure from both his family, mine and all of our friends to just suck it up and make him happy. I wasn't even out of school and I already had my life planned for me. In fact, I had my own personal plan totally pushed out of the way and a new plan hashed out for me.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1367739825.0,,,True,t3_1doncj,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1doncj/my_high_school_boyfriend_died_and_i_dont_care/,

Thanks, Reddit!

~~

i stayed up all night with the dog last night. It was really terrifying, and I've been bawling my eyes out with guilt and shame. The dog is only 7 months, I'll never be able to look myself in the eye if she is permanently damaged. She was a gift from me to my mum to brighten up her depressing solitary life, and I go and leave a bowl of weed cookies open on the counter while I take a shit. I'm such a fucking idiot. The dog barfed it up but was still spasming and freaking out all night and I was fucking terrified. 

I spent the night in my dads empty house (he's selling it soon) just hoping she'll be alright and calming her down. She wasn't really herself today at all, I can see the trauma in her eyes when she looks at me. She's wobbly and walks into things and is lethargic and depressed and I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself. Goddamn I want that little pup to be alright. Fuck. 

So I'm still tending her at like 6 pm when I hear a knock at the door. I was eating some pizza and petting my PTSD puppy and opened the door and saw the realtor with a whole family staring at me. ""umm... we BOOKED this time to view the house....."" she said, as I blushed furiously and got all my shit and got the hell out of there. I hadn't a leash with me since I had carried the dog the night before, and I had nowhere to go since my buddy had driven me over and my car is still parked at my mums. I text around and wander around the neighbourhood freezing and feeling like a homeless piece of shit with a makeshift scarf for a leash on my poor traumatized doggie. Eventually someone picks me up and drops me at home where I await my mothers return from work.

So she comes home and sees this dog and flips her shit - ""What have you done to my baby, you had her one day, what the hell happened, what is wrong with her, call the pet emergency clinic, etc""

We get there and they ask questions and I sit there feeling like a pile of fucking rotten shit as I lie and say she got like this after a walk in the woods where I lost sight of her for a bit. I told them about the barf and the symptoms and the timeline was the same, except I fabricated the setting... and didn't say anything about the weed cookies. If they're going to figure it out... well... might as well let mum think she ate that shit off the ground in the woods. I'm such an asshole. 

So as we're sitting there waiting for the basic bloodwork to be done, I start spilling my guts about my whole personal life to my mum, we have this bonding moment. In the end I ended up paying over 500 bucks for the tests and for leaving her there overnight to get IV flushed and monitored, and tbh I'm kinda glad because I'm worried that she'll never be the same... I'm such a dickhead... I deserve worse than debt. She is an innocent baby, and I am never going to smoke or consume weed ever again. This is fucked up. I love that dog more than my whole life. I'm an idiot. That's my confession.

I'm a democrat who grew up in a small, rural area where everyone openly hated black people, and I was very anti-racism.

My mother recently started dating a black man who refuses to even look for a job. He doesn't have a driver's license, no source of income whatsoever. My mother financially supports him, buys him all of his necessities, his drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, puts a roof over his head, takes him on spending sprees for hideous clothes that don't fit him, etc. She's behind on her bills because she gives him all of her money and she drives him around everywhere and gives him money like he's a little kid. He sounds really unintelligent when he speaks.

He hits her. She's always covered in bruises, on her arms, face, and back. One time he pushed her in front of a moving car. She's starting to talk like him. She refers to women as ""bitches"" and started using really bad grammar on purpose to sound ""cool"". She only listens to shitty radio radio rap. She's always been an alcoholic but she's drinking more than ever and she's started doing coke as well. I feel like I'm watching her throw her life away for this leech of a person. He's threatened to kill her and me. I've called the police before. They say she won't admit to him ever hitting her or threatening either of us and that there's nothing they can do because she refuses to press charges.

He cheats on her with ugly white women.

He has a child who he actively pretended to take care of for over a year. My mom mentioned that she's never seen his kid before. I told her how weird that was. Turns out, he pretended to have this kid to my mom for a year. The truth is, he knocked up some fat, ugly white lady in another state and never sees it.

He told her that his dad died and confessed to my mom how much he hated that he couldn't make it to his funeral because he didn't have money for a plane ticket even though it was only a few hundred dollars. About two months later, he was arrested for driving drunk (my mother's car, of course), without a license, with drugs on him, then failing to appear in court twice. When he was in jail, my mom had his cell phone. His dad called his cell phone. His ""dead"" dad.

He steals things from her house, her purse. She's caught him red handed. Sometimes after she goes to bed, he takes her car without her permission and takes her debit card to go out drinking. 

Like I said, I never thought I'd be this way, but I've gotten to know a black person and he just so happens to be all of the horrible stereotypes of black people. I know that not all black guys are like this, but I think horribly racist things about this man. He got in my face and called me names once and I got so mad and I didn't even know what to say that I called him a nigger. I've thought it for a long time and I still think of him as a nigger sometimes. I guess it's not so much racism against black women, mostly just the men who take no pride in their appearance and dress like wannabe rappers from the 90s. Not the educated ones or anything. But now I assume that black men who dress and act like he does are useless, bad people. A hindrance to society. 

My friends don't know. My boyfriend doesn't know. He's liberal and an extreme political activist. I don't think he'd date me anymore if he found out. I'm embarrassed. But I hate my mom's boyfriend.

I have no insurance, I will be fixing that shortly. Last year, when I had a suspicion, I asked my friend who is now a doctor to take a look.(we both did our prerequisites together, I dropped out, she stayed) 


The thyroid looks abnormal, strong signs of PCOS, and possible growths on the the kidney adrenal glands. Well fuck me sideways......


She assured me there are strong chances of beating it if is only ovarian and thyroid. 


Because we did this hush hush, I went and beefed up my life insurance to 3M. 1M of it is secret and will be paid to my daughter after certain criteria are met. I have also started a bit of a treasure hunt that she will have to do when she is older. I also privately updated my will. My husband and daughter will not be left wanting.


If it does come back worse then I imagine, I will be delegating my business work to my assistant manager, and I will be spending every single day of my life being with my daughter and husband. I have already begun a journal, and I am currently drawing a sketch each day of my husband and daughter regarding something memorable we did.


Only when we are face to face with mortality do we truly start living. 
I do not want my only regret to be that I did not live every moment to its fullest.

I have a healthy relationship, sex life, and lifestyle. I work out daily, I am attractive imo, I am driven and confident. I have an amazing dream job that just keeps getting better. Most importantly I had a normal happy childhood and was doted on by great parents who are still happily married... So WTF?!?!?

When I was about 13 I came across child porn on limewire (may have been Kazaa, I don't remember for certain) while downloading some music. Some of it stuck in my mind. I have never looked for it since. For several years now I can not come unless I imagine young girls being raped. Sometimes I remember the videos I saw, or I just make something up in my head. I am so disgusted with myself. I know rape fantasies are normal but this is just so over the top. It haunts me daily. 

I do not have children and honestly don't really want any. I would NEVER hurt or act out on any of this. When I see children in real life, it never crosses my mind. But when its time to have an O, it's the only thing that will get me there. I am starting to avoid sexual release because I hate this so much, and don't want it to damage my relationship. I just want to erase it from my mind.

*EDIT* Alright guys, I have got to admit that this subreddit is awesome. It feels great to get this off my chest. I have done some soul-searching, turns out it is a lot easier to do when something is put out in the open like this and examined from different angles. I want to reiterate, I do not find children ""sexy"" or ""attractive"". When I am around them, I feel protective of them, like most adults. I think pedophiles are the lowest form of human and have no sympathy for them. After putting a bit more reflection into the situation, it is the concept that gets me off- the idea of power over the most helpless thing I can think of. When this fantasy pops into my mind, I do not place myself in the position of the child but rather the position of the scumbag male. But it isn't to look or feel of a child that is attractive to me, it's the power. I am thinking I need to dig a little more on dominance and power issues, and because this is starting to effect my love life, I think I will seek some professional help.

We had a tumultuous relationship to say the least. He wanted so desperately to please everyone, that he made a habit of telling people whatever it was he thought they wanted to hear, and then doing whatever it was that he wanted. He promised me a future and told me he loved me. For the duration of our relationship he carried on a long distance affair with his girlfriend before me. I was aware of it. I spent our relationship trying to convince him to love me the way he *said* he did. I forgave and forgave and believed lie after lie. I was so broken down I clung to the remnants of the relationship as if ""fixing"" it would fix me. After countless fights and heartbreaks, I realized I had become apathetic. I didn't care if I talked to him or saw him anymore. In fact, his presence started to irritate me. I transitioned from a shitty bar job to an office gig and I was making new friends. I was receiving a lot of male attention and I started to realize being without him did not mean I was going to die alone. I didn't want to string him along the way he had me, so I told him in a brutally honest fashion that I was never going to be able to really forgive him for what he put me through and that I hated the sound of his voice and I was happier when I was away from him. He was hurt. He claimed he had finally realized how much I was worth to him. I told him it was too little too late and left. 

Now he has a new girlfriend. I know this because we've stayed in touch (mutual friends made civility a necessity). She is madly in love with him. It's very obvious. He won't talk about her with me. He avoids bringing her to functions that he knows I will be attending. When we see each other, he will make comments about how ""hot"" I am, actively seek me out to talk to, etc. It dawned on me that I was becoming what his ex was in our relationship. I realized that this is his modus operandi. He obsesses over his ex (that he ruined a relationship with) while also dating a new girl. His obsession ultimately destroys his relationship. Then he finds a new girl and ""misses"" the previous one. Unlike his last ex, I didn't fall for it. I'm not interested in him in any romantic capacity. And I certainly feel awful for the girl he is with. At the same time, though, I get this perverse joy out of knowing he's pining for me after all of the time I wasted loving him. It makes me happy that he's still into me, but unlike his previous ex, I'm over him and I don't want him anymore. I rationalize it by telling myself I'm not hurting his new girlfriend the way he and his last ex hurt me. But it's still Schadenfreude and part of me does feel bad about it.

Ever since, she has been staring at me and making comments about my size. She doesn't make the comments often, and I only recently realized she stares at me because my girlfriend is furious about it, and she has talked to me about it. She also told me that her friend has mentioned wanting to sleep with me, and I kinda figured that because she nearly admitted it the day before my girlfriend told me. 

I'm very flattered. I've always loved when girls have crushes on me. I grew up with very little self esteem and didn't start getting a lot of attention from women until high school. Still, it's awkward because she's my best friend's girlfriend and my girlfriend's best friend. 

I feel like I should be talking to my friend about this, but this is a very weird situation. I can't bring myself to even bring it up to him or his girlfriend. 

Ask me anything. I've been wanting to get this off my chest, but I don't think I can trust very many people I know in person to keep this to themselves.

Also, I don't care who sees my dick, and my girlfriend knows that, otherwise she wouldn't have shown the picture to anyone.

First, the back-story. Guy and I go way back, as in I went to daycare with him. We grew up together, went to the same high school, etc. At some point, however, we stopped ""clicking"". We no longer shared interests, started hanging out with different groups of people, and ended up at different colleges. We would talk on the phone once every 3-4 weeks to catch up and still very much confide in one another, though.

Anyway, I made some awesome friends in college--friends I meshed with much more than the subject of this confession. My buddy came to visit, and it was quite awkward. Childhood friend was a bit of a downer. I don't know if he was bored, jealous of my relationship with my college friends, etc. We started to grow apart even more than in high school. Later in college, I met my future wife.

Fast-forward to five years ago. My college friends and I are like brothers, and my friend from childhood and I still talk once a month or so. My fiance and I are planning our wedding, and are trying to decide on two weekends that appeared to work equally well for almost everyone. I told my wife I preferred Weekend A because I knew work would be rough the week after Weekend B. This was true, but if I'm honest with myself the real reason I chose A was because I knew my childhood friend wouldn't be able to attend. He was to move to the UK (I'm in the US) to start a new job a couple weeks before, and traveling back across the pond so soon wasn't feasible. I wanted to have the best time possible at my wedding, and I knew I'd have more fun without him there.

If he knew what I did, he'd be crushed. We still talk frequently and are each other's confidants at some level. That said, I almost think we're only friends now because we were friend ""then"", if that makes sense. There's no animosity at all, just a lack of common interests and wolrdviews.

Let's call her Jessica.  Well Jessica went to high school with some of my friends and was actually the ex of one of them.  

Eventually Jessica and her ex reconnected and started dating.  Nothing very serious, but dating nonetheless.  In time Jessica would turn up more frequently at our group events and I got to know her a lot more.  We got along great, genuinely enjoyed each others company, and would stay up all night chatting away long past when everyone else was passed out drunk.  

I eventually developed feelings for her, but I tried to bury them deep.  I didn't even want to think about them.  But the more we hung out, the more I couldn't help but notice those feelings growing stronger and stronger.  Eventually I just could not get her off of my mind.

One night she came over to hang out and watch tv at my place (Which is something we had done dozens of times before).  We had a few drinks and both eventually fell asleep on my couch.  I woke up at some point and went to my bedroom.  At some point in the night she came into my room and asked if she could sleep on my bed, and I of course said yes.  At this point she was still dating my friend, but was not in a real relationship with him.  I think it was her closeness to me, but I just could not stand it for one second longer, so I made a move and kissed her.  She didn't try to stop it, one thing led to another, and we had sex.   Honestly, it was amazing.. probably the best sex of my life.  In addition to that we talked and shared so much about our mutual feelings for each other that had always gone unsaid.  We stayed up until long after the sun had risen.  I wanted that night to last forever, but eventually she had to leave.  I'll never forget her telling me, ""Well, back to reality now.""  It made me incredibly sad realizing how true that was.

We talked about our options after that, but we (by ""we"" I mean ""she"") always came to the conclusion that we could not continue to have an affair.  Even if we both wanted it, the repercussions of our friends finding out would break our group of friends apart.  It would certainly destroy the relationship between my friend she was dating and myself.  I honestly did try at that point to not let anything happen again, but I could never turn her down when she wanted to hang out.  And when we hung out, sometimes sex would ensue.

Eventually her 'dating' my friend turned into a real relationship.  I found out via a Facebook post, ""Jessica is now in a relationship with So-and-So"".  That was a heart-breaker for me.  I was so in love, so infatuated with, and so blind to everything concerning this girl that I truly believed things would work out in my favor.  

At this point in time Jessica lived with her parents.  Her dad is a bad person and she was not happy there.  We had often talked about how cool it would be to live together before, and one day we finally decided to do it.  Again, in my blindness and pure deluge of emotions at the time I thought that this was a fantastic idea.  I truly believed that if we lived together she would see how much better I was than her boyfriend and she would want to be with me.  That didn't happen.  Jessica never was very financially stable, so to this day I have never charged her rent or asked her to help me financially with anything.  She made up some excuse about her dad kicking her out and having no where else to go.  She told her boyfriend that she had asked me and I agreed.  Her boyfriend lives with his parents too, so he wasn't upset about it, and even helped her move in.

There continued to be a few times after Jessica moved in that we slept together, but it wasn't very often.  My emotions were still high and I was happy to get any moment I could with her.  At this point in my story, I should mention that I only have a 1-bedroom apartment.  We set up Jessica's living quarters in the dining room area of the apartment.  It doesn't look bad, but there is certainly a lack of privacy for her.  Anyways, one day I came home and walked in on her and her boyfriend having sex.  

I think that's when I lost it.  Of course I always realized that she was sleeping with him too, but I pushed it to the back of my mind.  All of my emotions that were being kept in check just went berserk.  I couldn't stand it.  I packed up that day and took off to my dad's place out of state for a couple of days to clear my head.  I think I cried the entire way there.  While I was there was when I realized that this could not continue.   I came home, had a long talk with her, and from then on we have never slept together again.  It felt a lot like a break-up.

It's been about a year and a half since the beginning of these events and Jessica still lives with me.  My feelings for her have not diminished in the slightest.  I truly do love her.  The only thing that time has done is to make my feelings for her stronger.  I feel that sort of unconditional love that you have for family, along with being in love with her.  I have even tried dating other women (and have slept with them) but I cannot shake these feelings.  Everyone else feels inadequate, so I sabotage any chance there might have been with any other person.  I would still give up everything to be with Jessica.  In my mind, throwing away every friendship I have would be worth it to spend my life with her.  But I realize that will not happen.  She has made her choice.  At the same time I have realized that I cannot continue living with her if I ever hope to move on with my life and give myself a chance for happiness with someone else.  So I recently asked her to move out.  The discussion went amicably and she agreed it was for the best.  I gave her 3 months to find another place.  I sincerely hope that I will be able to move on.  I can't imagine feeling like this for another year, let alone the rest of my life.  I am in a constant state of sadness.  Suicide is a temptress that I often toy with.  I hope that all changes when she moves out.

I have never told another person any of this.

**EDIT #2: Wow! So much discussion since I last checked in...I will be answering some directly but just wanted to point out a couple things. First: Were the age of consent 16 I would still not be remotely tempted to actually act on this because, as many have pointed out, it is a violation of my professional ethics - and my position of authority over them would make it a transgression of my personal ethics as well. I love teaching and am lucky enough to work at a good school - definitely not something I would risk or sacrifice, even if I chose to ignore my own morals. Second: A few people have mentioned I need to find a significant other...but I am not really the sort for casual things and until summer rolls around I don't really have the time for hitting the scene. But to be clear, it hasn't been ages since I've ""gotten any"" or anything, and I assure you these fantasies are not prohibiting me from looking for or appreciating ""appropriate"" guys to date.**

Not just one, and not in a romantic sense...sexually, but also...well since I am confessing I will just say the most messed-up part: There is also a weird desire to 'mother' them, at least affectionately- and erotically-speaking. I want to teach them about pleasing a woman and help them become sexually mature, etc.

I am 32 and female, so perhaps it is my biological clock hurtling toward a collision with my sexual peak...but it's driving me to distraction.

For the record, I can say with certainty I will not act on this, but every night, at least after I've masturbated repeatedly to graphic thoughts of it, fantasizing about actual students, I feel a deep shame and depression.

I also have an audio recording of my ex roommate (a female) orgasming three times when she was hooking up with a one-night-stand a few months ago. I get off to these on a fairly regular basis.

I do have a line though. I would never post these online.  Mostly because i fear it would come back to me.

Although the naked pictures are a nice bonus, I get off on reading their personal emails too. Sexual, break-up emails, bitching.  It's all gold.

1360792568.0,123,self.confession,18gyy4,I turned a girl into a speed freak and eventually gave her drugs for sex.,153,30,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18gyy4/i_turned_a_girl_into_a_speed_freak_and_eventually/,"I am a former drug dealer. I haven't sold any drugs in a long time and don't plan on doing it again because I have a good job and selling drugs can be very stressful.

I mainly sold marijuana, but occasionally sold hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin mushrooms (when I could find 'em, they're some rare mofos where I'm from) and also amphetamines like Ritalin and Adderall. 

I was slowing down my dealing. I didn't realize it at the time but the gradually decreasing number of sales I had been engaging in would eventually lead to no sales at all. My customer base had been slowly disappearing because I was lazy and pretty unreliable, and I finally quit dealing when my customer base was pretty much nothing (It's way easier to quit selling drugs when you're barely making profit. Back in the day, quitting was unfathomable because of how many Benji's found their way to my pocket). 

Before I decided to quit, I was trying to find myself more customers and I asked a few girls I knew if they'd heard of Adderall. They had all smoked weed and drank alcohol before, but none of them had tried speeding. I easily convinced them to try it and they all bought and tried one. None of them asked to buy another except for one girl, we can call her Sarah. (Not her real name)

Sarah, over the next few weeks, gradually bought more and more Adderall off me, starting with 3 pills a week, all the way up to two a day. For a month or two, she was buying 2 pills off of me every day. She lived 3 blocks away and we both had cars anyways so meeting was never a problem.

The day ""it happened"", I was at her house. I had just gotten a new bottle of Adderall, and she was really excited to buy some, because it was extended release (the amphetamines release into your body initially when you take it and again four hours later) instead of instant.

We had always had a flirty, ""female customer and male drug dealer"", type of relationship. Any male drug dealers know what I'm talking about.   She would always touch my arm, when she'd hug me her boobs would always end up pressed up against my chest so I could see her cleavage, she'd always wear the most revealing clothes around me, she'd always smile at me and say ""hi its_just_a_ride"", emphasizing my name in a sexual way, etc. Keep in mind that even though she was acting as if she had interest in me, it was completely because of the drugs. I'd sometimes give her an extra pill or two, and she'd be really flirty/all over me the next time. As a drug dealer, I felt fake alot of the time, I felt like I was constantly having to pretend to like people I didn't like to make sales (no one wants to buy off of an asshole), and even though I knew she was being fake to me, it felt good to pretend like someone actually cared about me/was into me.

So we're in her house, she ""can't find"" her wallet. She tried to pull this on me once before. Her money is ""missing"" but if I give her the Adderall she'll take some and it will help her find it. Bullshit. I refused the first time and I was going to again. She says we should go look in her car, and she takes my hand and leads me outside. She hadn't held my hand before so I was kinda weirded out, but I walked with her out to her car. I was behind her. I remember watching her ass as we walked down the front porch steps to her car. She had been a bit too thick for my tastes before she started the Adderall but it had made her lose a few pounds and I was noticing how she was so fucking sexy now. She was a bit thick (she wasn't bone thin but certainly not at all overweight) and because of that she had a really, really nice, round ass and really nice boobs. I know, I know, I'm a disgusting, objectifying, pig. The wind blew and I smelled her perfume, she smelled so flowery and feminine. She opened her car door and leaned inside, purposefully sticking out her butt way far out. I felt some blood rush to my cock. it wasn't a full hard on but it was definitely semi-hard.

She can't find the money so we go inside to look in her room one last time. She asks if she can just have the Adderall because she's a loyal customer. I told her I would but I had to profit if I wanted to keep dealing, and I also asked her if she'd get a free Whopper every once in a while if she ate at Burger King daily and she understood it was business. Then, she looked me right in the eyes and stuttered, ""I- I'll give you head for 25 pills."" I only had 60 and said no because I thought that would be a huge hit to my finances. But I realized if I just smoked less weed every day for a week I could sell what I didn't smoke and get my money back. So I said yeah, and she instantly got on her knees and started going to town.

It was an amazing blowjob, and I came in her mouth. We were smoking a cigarette afterwards, and I was gonna leave her house, but I was still horny so I told her she could have the rest of my pills if she fucked me. She didn't hesitate at all. She lead me upstairs and I fucked her doggystyle. I lasted way longer than I expected (probably because I had just gotten blown) even though I was staring at her ass the whole time we fucked. It was bouncing up and down and shit. So fucking hot.

I busted and we smoked another cig each. I told her before I left I'd give her double what I had just given her if she let me fuck her up the ass someday. I know many of you think it's disgusting, but really, it's so awesome. She looked at me with disgust and said no, she told me she never had done anal and never wanted to. So we go our separate ways.

I sold for a month or two after that but she never tried to buy anything off of me again. At the time, I thought it was awesome, but looking back, I feel bad because A) she was addicted to Aderall and I was her only connect, and she STILL didn't want to buy from me, because (I think) she was uncomfortable and thought she'd end up fucking me again for more drugs. B) I realize that she had no attraction to me and probably didn't even like it, but at the time I felt really shitty about everything and it felt really good to pretend that someone wanted to fuck me. 

It's in the past and I don't dwell on it too much and I won't do it again. But I still feel bad about it and it felt really good to get all of that off of my chest.

He was a young dad, so he has always been more of a buddy than a father.  Throughout my childhood it has been him and I.  My mother was never in the picture, I don't even think I would recognize her now if I saw her on the street.

Going on.  My dad and I are close, we have been close for sometime.  I'm in my early 20's now, and my dad just turned 40.  People who meet us assume we are a gay couple... and they're right.

It began in my teens.  We played video games, we wrestled, we worked out together, we got drunk together.  I always admired my dad for being the man he is, and he stood by me no matter what I chose.  And when I decided to leave school to become a chef, he stood beside me.

One night we had arrived home from dinner together.  We were on the couch talking, and it was the lighting, the way we were looking at each other, maybe the conversation we were having.  The way he looked at me... just something inside me made me want to kiss him.  Not thinking I went for it.  I just did it.  He didn't stop me, infact he held the back of my head and kept me there.  

That was the first incident.  We stopped, and it didn't go further that night.  But things were not awkward betwen us, infact, we seemed to be more close.

The next time we were having dinner and came home, things felt strangely familiar while we were sitting on the couch talking.  This time he kissed me.  And he kept kissing me, and I held him closer to me.  And it went further from there.  It went far.

The next day, when I woke up, it was like it was cemented; we were no longer father and son, we were lovers.  And when I got out of the bed, my heart broke because I was leaving him to go back to my own room.

After that night, I haven't slept in my own bed.  And since then, we have moved across the country.  We haven't assumed new identities, but we walk around the city holding hands, at work my colleagues know him as my partner.  And the fact that we have the same last name, people assume we are married.  No one asks how we met.  I guess though if anyone asked, we would most likely lie and make something up.

On the outside, we look like a typical ""daddy/son"" couple.  But no one assumes we're actually daddy and son.

I'm not ashamed.  I love him.  He's my dad.

But I had to make this confession.

I work on every single part of my body so that I can exhuast myself at the end of the day. Feeling tired at night is great - it allows me to sleep more easily, or at least I like to pretend that it does. I still stare at the ceiling for an hour or more every night dreading my inability to fall asleep quickly like most people can. Still, I like to pretend that by being a workaholic at work and then going to the gym after a 11 hour work day help me fall asleep.

Well, enough pretending. The real reason is for my working my ass off everyday is because I am frustrated with my life. I am afraid to confront my emotions. As a result, I have all this suppressed anger, sadness, loneliness, and general ennui about life. Whenever my heartrate is above 170 and I am doing cardio, I think about the times when I was too afraid to confess my feelings, the times when people doubted me, the times when life treated me bad, and how I want to fight back and win. I also like to lift and run and try to get my muscles sore. I actually find the pain and soreness to be pleasurable.

Alas, I can only confess this on an anonymous forum using my alternate account that no one knows. I am even afraid to confront my own feelings. I don't understand why I do the things I do. Why am I afraid to confront and express my emotions? I don't understand. Maybe I should give up at understanding myself. I suck.

Social networks became the basis of this confession as it lead to a documented reason for a lack of trust in our marriage early on. Just to note, the trust is back in our marriage as my views of her conduct has changed slightly.

My Wife worked part time, so her remaining hours of the day while I was at work was spent online on various social networks. The early social networks were not based on friends you already knew, but more meeting new friends, which she did.

The attention she began receiving from other men online filled the gaps in the lack of attention I was providing her and so things progressed. Once I figured out what was going on, I installed a key logger on our computer. It recorded EVERYTHING. Including things she did on webcam. While my initial reaction was rage, I kept it to myself and oddly began to enjoy it as it continued. I was able to see a different side of her sexually and it fascinated me and also urged me to see how far things would go. To note, it was always an online thing (to my knowledge). She is not computer savvy, so my ""tracking"" was always undetected. When things slowed down in her online world, I decided to light the flame again...

I began creating online personas to interact with her online and see how far I could push things. What I could get her to do that maybe she wasn't vocal with me about. Things she liked, didn't like, etc.

I've slipped up in these scenarios in the past, so at times I wonder if she is just playing along or using this to communicate with me in a way she feels she cannot.

**TL;DR - Early in marriage caught the wife doing questionable things online (cyber sex, webcam,pics, etc) and after being initially pissed, kinda got into it and enjoyed it, so I started making online profiles to interact with her and see what I could get her to do (web cam, chatting, pics, etc.)**",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_yj58k,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/yj58k/what_she_doesnt_knowor_maybe_she_does/,

I married her Mom when I was 29 and she was 8. In total I have 4 Step-children aged 16, 15, 13, and 11 all girls except the youngest. I have a biological daughter who is also 13 but she lives out of state and I haven't seen her since she was about 6. I am sure you all know what is coming, but I will preface it to say that no, I have never touched her. Now on to the horrible details (possible wall of text ahead).

My wife and I are very over protective of our children, my wife more so than I am. We did not let our kids have email accounts or Facebook accounts until they were at least 14 and our younger 2 still don't have them. My oldest is every parents dreams of a child. Responsible to the Nth degree, 4.3 GPA, #1 of 394 students in her class for 3 years straight, etc. etc. etc. Kay on the other hand is the exact opposite. Rebellious, selfish, talks back, can't be counted on to do anything, constantly lies, basically a typical teenager.

When we started allowing them to go online I installed a spyware program on the computer in order to monitor their internet activity without their knowledge. Kay repeatedly created Facebook accounts without our permission and against our rules and tried to hide them from us, but because of my software I always knew. She found out about the software after we confronted her about the Facebook accounts and she lost all computer privileges for quite some time. Once she earned them back, and we allowed her to have a Facebook, she was very careful about what she said on the computer while at home because she knew about the software. Kay never talks to her Mother or me about anything going on in her life, everything is a huge secret and we never now anything that she does or says.

I got a stupid idea to create a fake girl online in order to become her friend and hopefully get some insight into what was going on in her life that she kept so secret from us. I know, it was a stupid, dumb idea and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

So I made friends with Kay and started talking to her and it was going ok for awhile. After about 6 months she started to suspect something was fishy and in order to ""save myself"" I created another person (the fake girl's cousin) and introduced them. Kay had had 2 serious crushes on boys that happened to have the same name (we'll say Josh), so naturally I named my new boy persona Josh in order to give myself an ""in"".

Kay is VERY starved for attention because she is always in trouble at home because of the things that she does, and she and Josh hit it off almost immediately. Within weeks they were ""dating"" across the internet and I was in essence my 14 year old step-daughter's boyfriend. Things escalated quickly and at one point we ended up having cyber sex while I was at work and she was home with one of her gf's (she was using her gf's phone to chat with me so that her conversations couldn't be monitored on the computer). As horrible as it is, I really enjoyed the encounter and masturbated ashamedly in my office the whole time.

As it was bound to happen I got caught by my wife.  She had gone through my phone and found the email accounts I had made.  She was beyond pissed, and I can't blame her and I deserved every ounce of what she gave me and more.  I was also ""caught"" by Kay when she had one of her friends over and they were emailing me from the friends phone and (unknown to me at the time) watching me as I responded on my phone.  

She now hates me, rightfully so, although she doesn't have solid ""proof"" it was me.  I don't understand why my wife didn't leave me immediately, she certainly should have in order to protect her daughter.  My relationship with Kay has been utterly destroyed and I have no hope of ever repairing it, and I don't deserve to have it repaired either.  I am extremely attracted to her and find myself watching her and fantasizing about her in ways that no grown man should.  It's just her though, I don't think of any other underaged people like this and I don't know what to do.

So my dad and me have always been really close. We have the same sense of humor, taste in movies...he always knows how to react to me when I'm in a bad/good mood, etc. Basically he's one of my best friends (by the way I'm a 17 year old girl). But then...he touches me. I don't even know if it can count as being molested. He mostly does it when I'm half-asleep in the morning...he'll start by rubbing my back (which I think is a fairly normal parental thing to do...except he'll unclasp my bra), then he'll move sort of towards my chest or he'll grab my butt. If I'm laying on my stomach, he'll usually straddle me by sitting on my butt...he really likes it, like he massages and bites it (at this point I'm so tired I'm barely conscious, or I feel bad, like I'll hurt his feelings if I try to get up). Sometimes he'll say really gross things that I honestly think I imagine (because whose dad would say those kinds of things?); if I say I need to get up and shower he'll offer to take one with me. Or one time he said he'd give me a purple nurple or that we should make out. Another time I remember him sucking on my finger. And I feel like this is my fault because I LET him do it. All I want is to have my back rubbed or something, but he always ALWAYS takes it further. Sure I try to shy away from him, like curl up into a ball or something, but then he resists or laughs this uncomfortable kind of laugh.  

One time he asked me if I thought he was creepy. I didn't say anything, just pretended I was still asleep. Once when we were on vacation in Mexico, only him and me were still at the beach (my mom went back up to the hotel). He was looking out at the water and he said something like, ""I'm a terrible father""; I just kind of knew what he meant but I asked him why. I was really uncomfortable and not completely listening, but he said something around the lines of, ""I'm probably confusing you"" (I think I nodded). Then he said something close to, ""I just like rubbing you."" Then I stood up and said I was going to go back to the hotel and he asked if I wanted to talk about it. I said, ""No. Thanks for saying sorry."" Then went back up to our room. 

He still touches me. He'll give me a back rub, but kind of put his hands down the front of my shirt, just barely touching my chest. I know I should have talked to him about it, but I was so uncomfortable and mad and ashamed...and the thing is, I can't ever tell anyone about it. I love my dad to death and overall he probably has the best moral compass of anyone I've ever known. If I told it would destroy our family and his life. Plus this might not even be that big a deal; some dads do WAY worse to their daughters. 

It feels better to get this out of me! Thank you all for reading, sorry it was so long. Any advice?

If someone identifies themselves as a Democrat or Republican (even some lesser party affiliations), I assume they're sheep, unable to think for themselves and that we couldn't really be friends.  I consider myself to be a very logical thinking person and I rely on evidence, backed with raging skepticism, to make my decisions.

I do like some local bands, but it's rare. These are just a few examples of how I'm elitist and judgmental.

I hate people in general.  From experience, almost every person I meet is disgusting to me.  I deplore the moral compass most individuals follow and I hate how selfish the average person can be.  Maybe it's a result of my upbringing, but being from The South, I always thought people here were supposed to be more hospitable.  

I guess my point is that I just hate so many things about people that I'm rarely able to truly befriend someone because they don't meet some strange standard I have set for myself.  I feel like most people I meet are inferior, not necessarily to me, but just as functional beings in society.  I know this probably makes me sound like a gigantic asshole, and I'm ok with that.  I'm posting this because I can't help but wonder if anyone else feels this way.  

Am I a borderline sociopath?  Do other people feel this way about society?  I'm open to questions and discussion.  I don't know how to hate people less or if I should even try.

http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17zdp0/i_straight_male_have_sexy_chats_with_exchange/

So my cousin and I went out to the bar on Saturday night with some mutual friends, we got loaded, usual stuff, just a group of friends hanging out.

We get back to my place around 3am and he asks if I have any more booze in the house, and I crack a couple beers and then say I'm gonna take a quick shower before settling in. I spend less than two minutes in the shower, I really just wanted an excuse to get undressed.

I walk back into the room and hes in just his boxers turning on the xbox and im just naked toweling off and I made a joke about something that happened at the bar. He looked over at me and said something like ""dude your dick is so much bigger than mine!"" This is so not true, and I say no way, and he says ""yeah, see""

We stands up and whips it out standing right up close to me and then we kinda held them out towards each other to compasre side by side.

We both got hard, there was a moment when we looked into each others eyes. In retrospect I think I might be in love with him because of that moment, I'm pretty confused. 

It was really the strangest and best experience of my life. We're both over 190cm and 90kg rugby players, masculine guys, (he's a bit bigger than me, I'd say probably 195cm and close to 100kg) but we started making out and before I knew it I was fucking him. I fucked my own cousin in the ass. I'd never even done anal with a girl before. 

It only lasted a couple minutes and we both came and slept in the bed together naked, woke up in the morning and jerked off together. He took a shower and came out dressed and then everything was just like it was before. I was afriad to mention anything about it in case it was just a huge mistake.

I broke up with my girlfriend on Monday not because I think that I'm gay or anything but just because I am pretty sure that I am in love with him and I have no idea what to do and it isnt fair to her to stay with her after I cheated. 

We've texted a bit since but I have no idea what to do now. I think I'm gonna invite him out for drinks again this weekend. ",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_18dzah,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18dzah/update_the_otherwise_straight_guy_who_wants_to/,
1359596872.0,120,self.confession,17lnil,"For over a year, I was in an online relationship with a 13-year-old boy who was pretending to be his older sister",145,25,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17lnil/for_over_a_year_i_was_in_an_online_relationship/,"So this is a followup to this: http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/mloul/ive_developed_an_internet_relationship_with_a/

It ended last November, and I was really unhappy.  I still didn't know the truth.  For over a month I was super depressed because I thought I loved this person (that didn't really exist).  I felt like I was being pretty careful.  I'm not stupid.  I know there are liars out there but it wasn't like it could happen to me, right?  But furthermore, who would have expected a 13-year-old would be pretending to be his older sister?

I told 2 friends about it because I had told them about ""her"" beforehand.  

Finally in late December he recontacted me and told me the truth.  I didn't believe it at first because he had such a good story.  He had access to her real Facebook, her laptop for some pictures that couldn't be found elsewhere, and of course her whole schedule.  If she went somewhere he made sure to say he was going there.  Things like ""I'm going to a concert"" and then the next day there were pictures ofa  concert on her Facebook.  It made sense.

We did things like show each other our rooms.  So there were pictures of his sister in front of objects he showed me without her.  We even voice chatted, but at that age his voice had not deepened, and I wasn't looking to bust ""her"" at that point.

There are some other things, too.  Back in May I believe (s)he disappeared for a month.  I needed access to ""her"" Steam account to help her get some TF2 items because she asked me to do that for her.  The problem was that I lost Steam Guard authentication on my PC due to a reformat.  I guessed ""her"" email password, and it was actually his sister's real email address.  I'm not proud of it, but I snooped, and it further cemented in my mind that she was real.  Messages going back many years to people that she had on her Facebook friends.  He told me later that she abandoned that email address so he just took over.

My friends asked me ""why didn't you ever video chat?""  Well there's an easy answer there.  It was literally impossible for ""her"".  As we know, Australia has horrible Internet, but ""her""s was THE WORST.  ""Her"" parents refused to get a wired connection into their house.  They had opted for a cellular solution through Virgin.  They had a 2GB data cap a month until their speeds were throttled down to 30KB/s maximum.  I felt really bad for ""her"" because she had to be really careful with how she used her internet.  I never really pushed it because I knew it wouldn't be possible.  Everything else made me believe I was talking to his sister and not him.

In hindsight there are some things that were potential red flags, but I doubt many people would have picked up on them.

Anyway, that's not the best way I could have told that story, but I felt like rambling more than writing a 100% concise story.  ",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_17lnil,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17lnil/for_over_a_year_i_was_in_an_online_relationship/,
1337752581.0,122,self.confession,u0mpu,I just got back from a stripclub... where my sister works. And she doesn't know I was there. ama if you want,146,24,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u0mpu/i_just_got_back_from_a_stripclub_where_my_sister/,"Man I'm in a real shame spiral right now. I cannot believe I did that. I can't believe how awesome it was. I mean how sick it was. I mean how horrible I am. I mean how amped up I feel right now. Shit! This is easily the single most disgusting thing I've ever done in my life. Isn't it? I don't know. Fuck fuck fuckfuckfuckfuck.

Okay the backstory. I recently moved back home from college cause even though I'd like to I can't afford to stay on campus during the summer, plus I always have an awesome summer job waiting for me when I come home (I've worked there for years). My sister is two years younger then me (19) and has never moved out. She goes to community college and supposedly works at a chain restaurant (more on that later). Well a little while ago I was bumming around the internet when I decided to check my facebook page. Low and behold the most recent entry on my feed was from my sister. The message was really strange and something like: What up guys!! Had a lot of fun with you tonight! ;) Hope you liked my performance! Can't wait to see you at STRIPCLUB this weekend!”

Now I knew the name of the stripclub though I've never been there. It's this really sketchy looking place near the airport that I've driven past many, many times. So I was really confused. Surely my sister didn't work there, right?! No way. My sister is NOT that kind of girl. Her account must have been hacked or there was a fb glitch or she was making some stupid joke. I decided to forget about it.

Then I got to thinking about it and it occurred to me that she had quite a few expensive things for a part-time waitress at Chain Restaurant and full time community college student. And she definitely is a full-time student. Unless she's playing a huge con with made up fb updates, spending money on college textbooks, and forging printed out results of her latest semester (all A's) on the fridge. No, she's definitely in school and definitely working at Chain Restaurant. But how could she afford the latest iPad, the iPhone, her mac computer, her used (but really nice, hella lot nicer than mine) car? Does commuting to college year round really save you THAT much money? I mean, fuck! I work when I'm at school and I can't afford shit.

Well after awhile it occurred to me that I should search for STRIPCLUB on facebook. And whatta ya know, they have a fanpage. I scrolled around it for a bit and then bam, there it was. The exact same message my sister had temporarily posted on her real profile. Except it was posted by “Trixie” (not really, bad stereotype stripper name tho). I clicked on her profile and there was only one picture of her there but lots and lots of status updates. In the picture she was wearing a ridiculous wig but it was definitely her.

Now after this discovery I almost came to reddit to ask for advice: what should I do?? But I knew what the hivemind would decide: talk to her about it or just leave it alone. There wasn't much chance the top voted comment would be a well thought explanation for why I should go to the stripclub and have a look and that's definitely what I wanted to do. So I gave reddit the finger and made a plan.

First I made sure she'd be working. On her fb alt-page I saw that she always mentioned when she'd be at Stripclub. Sure enough, early this afternoon there was an update from her saying that she hoped to see everyone tonight between 6pm-2am. After she left for her job at “Chain Restaurant” I put my plan into action. I went to the barber shop and had them shave off my beloved beard (meh, wasn't that badass anyway) then I went to a drugstore and bought some fake glasses. Finally I donned an old baseball cap I'd found buried in my closet that I'd only worn once before and I drove to the Stripclub.

This place is sleazy fellas. For my 21 birthday my buddies brought me to one near campus that was honestly pretty classy. If I didn't have a girlfriend I would probably have gone back many times cause the women were hot and the atmosphere was upbeat... but I do have a girlfriend and one of my presents for my 21st was her letting me go to a stripclub. Well anyway, Stripclub is nothing like that. It's this squat little building in a run down part of town about two miles from the airport. Shady looking as fuck but the parking lot is always full. I made sure to park in the back.

They ID'd me at the door and once I was inside I kept glancing around, worried I'd run into my sister. From far away I was pretty sure I was unrecognizable but close up? Fuck, she'd know it was me. So I found a seat pretty far away from the stage (there were three; two small ones, one main one) and ordered a beer.

After about ten minutes the announcer did his “everyoneputyourhandstogetherfor TRIXIE!” voice and whoa, there she was, sauntering onto the main stage wearing a g-string, a little bikini, and stilettos. She wasn't wearing a wig like she had in her fb profile picture either and it was definitely definitely her. I watched her dance and eventually strip and well boing. Yeah that happened. Watching sis spin around that pole topless and crawl over to strange men to have them slide dollar bills into her skimpy little g-string was a huge turn on. When her “set” was over I watched her take this douchy looking guy toward the “backroom” for a private dance (I already knew all about it cause I'd been asked by at least three other dancers already if I wanted a private dance).

Originally I meant to only see if it was really her and maybe have a little peek but man, I just couldn't leave. I kept drinking and I stayed for at least two hours. I saw her perform at least six times and after her last time I finally asked one dancer who was chatting with me for a private dance myself. She agreed and we went into the backroom. For three songs this girl ground herself on me but mainly I was trying to get a look at sis, who was fortunately (or unfortunately) quite a distance away. Watching her grind herself on her customer was even more arousing than having the dancer who was grinding herself on me continuously reach into my pants to “adjust” my cock. After the third song my dancer whispered to me that for $100 she'd suck me off but we'd have to do it outside. I declined and then staggered downstairs after paying her for the dances.

That's when I realized I was too fucked up to drive. I asked the bartender if she could call me a cab and to my surprise she said they worked with an even better service that would drive me home in my own car! I'd never heard of anything like that. A drink later the dude arrived, put his little moped in the back of my sedan, and drove me home in my car like a fucking boss. I don't know if that service is everywhere but it should be. So much better than having to leave your car somewhere, especially at a stripclub.

That was my night, reddit. I'm sitting here, drinking still, and wavering between feeling horny as fuck and miserable as fuck all. Shame and guilt at one moment, “that was fucking sweet” the next. Am I fucked up? I mean if a woman wants to strip, I don't give a shit. I don't think less of them. Never known a stripper before but fuck, I wouldn't judge someone who said that's what they did. I don't judge my sister! But for me to intentionally go and sort of spy on my sister while she did her thing... that's creepy. Isn't it?

AMA if you want but I'm drinking still and might be nearing the tipping point. I started this post at midnight and have had to edit it so much that it's almost been two hours now.

1352257937.0,119,self.confession,12rqy8,[Update] I went back to my abusive ex and he ruined me.,156,37,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/12rqy8/update_i_went_back_to_my_abusive_ex_and_he_ruined/,"[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/11p54b/i_went_back_to_my_abusive_ex_and_he_ruined_me/) a link to my original post. I know it didn't receive a whole lot of attention, but I know the people that were kind enough to respond would appreciate an update. I know I was pretty absent from the first thread, but it's only because it's an extraordinarily hard/crazy time in my life.

So, I have to admit, I didn't immediately cut contact with him. It took me about a week. The day after I posted my first thread, he called me and apologized profusely. Said that he didn't mean any of it, that he loved me so much and that I was the most amazing girl in the world in every way. And like I am, I fell back into his arms because I was scared and lonely, and I missed him. He stayed at my place for the rest of the week.

About a week later we got into another fight because I had sent him a text and called him once while he was out with friends. After a lengthy fight over the phone, he told me he would be over to my place in a couple minutes to get something that he had apparently left there, and then hung up and wouldn't answer my calls. I didn't want him to come over, but he let himself in the building and by the time he was at my door I just let him in. It was pretty obvious that he was infuriated, he kept calling me a slut, a psycho bitch, the usual. He came out from the bedroom after getting the textbook he had left there, and I was standing near the door asking him to just calm down and talk to me. He then grabbed the back of my neck and pinned me down to the ground (some wresting move that he knew, he's really strong). He pinned my arms behind my back and pressed my face into the floor while twisting my arm. I tried to scratch him and I think I ripped his shirt trying to get him off me. Every time I tried to get up he would do it again. After I finally got up he pushed me hard enough for me to fall and the left.

Holy shit, man. It really kicked me in to gear. I suddenly realized (with the help of the people that gave me advice in my earlier thread) that this was NOT in my head and I was not crazy. I called the police and filed a report. A cop showed up with a crime lab person to take pictures of the bruises on my arms and my bleeding knee. But overall, the cop was really unfriendly and unhelpful, and generally treated me like I was making shit up. I guess not surprising, considering I live in a state notoriously bad in dealing with domestic violence. The case was dismissed the day after. Apparently, all they did was call him, and all he had to do was tell them I was blocking his path and that was all the evidence they needed to close the case against him. I honestly don't get it. I don't understand why they would take his word against mine, even though I had the injuries. I don't understand how, even if that was the case (which it wasn't), that would justify the injuries he gave me. I am pretty disappointed with the way the whole thing was handled. Additionally, he called my mom a few hours afterward and tried telling her a completely different story. He also tried to tell her that I was going to kill myself and tried to convince her to call the cops. I have absolutely not threatened to end my own life or harm myself in any way. You guys were right, my mom ended up being completely supportive of me in helping me through this. Though I'm really embarrassed, she hasn't shown any disappointment in me.

So I sought a restraining order against him. I was granted a temporary order, and have yet to have the hearing to make it a permanent one. Honestly, I'm really afraid to go to the hearing. I don't have a whole lot of evidence. Since the case was dismissed, there's not a whole lot of evidence of him doing anything wrong. I'm afraid of being in the same room with him, I'm afraid of what he'll say. I'm afraid that he'll tell more lies and they'll believe him over me. I'm afraid I won't get the restraining order, and I'll look like a fool. I'm afraid that if I lose, he'll do something worse in retaliation. I feel like it might be better if I just don't show up, so I at least don't make him angry. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid I'll be labeled a crazy liar. 

But no matter what happens with the restraining order, I will NOT let him back in to my life. I will not become the woman who stays with her abuser and ends up dead in a ditch somewhere. I hope I can recover from this, though it seems like a long way off. This has been so much harder than I ever realized. But I owe a huge thank you to everyone who replied to that thread because, without that support, it's very likely I wouldn't have reported to assault, and that I would still be in the cycle of abuse. 

TL;DR: About a week after the incident I talked about in the previous thread, he assaulted me. I made a police report, which failed to materialize into anything. I filed a temporary restraining order, but haven't had the hearing to get the permanent one yet. I'm terrified of going to the hearing, and am considering not going because I don't know if I even have a shot. I'm so afraid of being labeled a liar. But I owe a huge thank you to all the people who gave me advice in the last thread, because it really motivated me to get out. I haven't spoken to him since the incident, which I guess was only a week and a half ago, but it feels like forever. It's been hard, but going this long without going back to him is unprecedented, a huge accomplishment for me, and I absolutely will not fall in to that trap again.

I've been with the same woman for a decade.  She saved me from a very dark time in my life, when my parents deserted me.  I love her.  I am more attracted to her than anyone I have ever met.  I see so much beauty in her, inside and out.  We moved in after a few years of dating.  We got a dog together.  We have everything in common.  We marathon our favorite shows together, we go to the same concerts, watch the same movies and even play the same video games.  We also share the same massive group of friends. She has always had a brash, cold exterior at times and can be very blunt with her honesty.  Me on the other hand, I am more sensitive, heart-on-my-sleeve.  She's very sharp, has a good memory and is very organized.  I am clumsy, forgetful and it takes me between 2-5 times to learn a new habit or fix a dumb mistake.  We always had these issues.  I've always had a problem with how she communicated with me and she's always had a problem with thick-headedness.  Three years ago she lost her mother to cancer.  It was awful.  I have never seen her in such pain and distress.  I would leave work early just to run to her side and hold her will she shook with anxiety.  Did I mention I have anxiety too?  Probably should have, but I was able to shutdown my own shit and be there for her for a good year or so.  One day she had a revelation.  ""I treat people like shit"", she said.  ""What happened to me?"".  I told her she's still a good person she just has to work on communicating with people in a less hurtful way, stop using insults and harsh words to get your point across.  Anyway, she got worse.  We got back to fighting.  Her being mad at me for forgetting dumb shit.  Me being upset with her for berating me and calling me nasty names.  I still love her though.  I still saw the beauty in her.  We still had a lot of beautiful, wonderful times.  
  
  The night before she left for vacation she went out with some co-workers.  I wanted her to come back and hang out with me, after all, she was going on a huge trip for a week and leaving the next day.  It got later and later.  She called near midnight to tell me she was drunk but safe.  She texted me to say she was at a restaurant trying to sober up.  I said ""keep me posted.  who are you with?""  No responses.  I periodically called for a couple of hours, hoping and praying that she was safe.  2am was approaching.  She's never done this before, but she's drunk and possibly alone, and she leaves for a huge trip early in the morning.  My fear and paranoia increased.  I kept fearing she was hurt or got into an accident.  I double-called every 10 minutes, hoping she would hear my phone.  Finally, she calls after 3am.  Said she was too drunk to look at her phone and needed to rest in her car.  I yelled at her, told her ""at least tell me you are safe when it's after 2am"".  She got home ok though, and that's all that mattered.  
  
She left the next day.  It was a planned vacation with family, a long time coming.  I called her one day and I could tell something was wrong.  I told her she could be honest with me, just tell me.  She spent nearly two hours explaining how disgusted she was with herself, that she treats me horribly.  ""I'm a cunt to you and you don't deserve it.  I'm awful to you but you never put me in my place"", she concluded saying maybe we are just better as friends.  After all, that's how we started...I told her to ""stop"".  I told her ""let's make a decision when you get back"".  I spent the next or so talking to a few close friends, who agreed ""there is no victim here"".  I refused to say a bad thing about her.  I was hurt but I couldn't fault her.  
  
She got home and things were weird.  We seldom addressed the issue beyond her occasionally saying ""I still don't know what I want"".  I started to think that maybe we should live in different places while we figure things out.  She was ""fine just hanging out"" but it hurt me too much to be around her all the time.  It hurt more and more.  I started talking long walks home and crying to myself because I couldn't allow myself to break down in front of anyone else.  

  
Here's where it gets weird.  She started talking to me about a co-worker every single day.  A co-worker who is in his 40's and used to be friendly with her but now won't talk to her because she's ""too liberal"". Every day she told me and our friends how big of a jerk he is, that he won't look her in the eye because of her political views.  Every day she talked about him.  One day she asks me ""is it possible for us to see our texts when we log into our phone account"".  ""No"", I said without thinking.  I paused.  ""Wait, why?"".  ""Oh nothing"", she said.  ""My friend said something funny but I accidentally deleted it"".  I sat her down and looked her in the eye.  ""I need to ask you something.  Has anything ever happened between you and anyone else?  We've been together for a decade and I've never doubted you but please just answer me.  Things are weird right now but if something happened, just tell me.  I'll be hurt but we'll figure it out.  I won't flip out.  You can keep the dog, you still live here, we'll figure it out.  I just need to truth.  It's important.""  She looked me in the eyes and laughed ""No, of course not.  I promise.  Nothing has ever happened.""  I reminded her that this is the time to tell me and that it was just important to have her honesty.  She repeated her answer ""No.  There's no one else.  I promise.""  Fine.  I believed her.  I shut off my paranoia.
  
The weeks went on.  I called her one day, to check on her.  She sounded fine.  I explained that no matter what happens between us, I'll always care about her.  She said ""our main problem is that you make dumb mistakes, apologize, then make them again"".  Hold up.  I'm aware this is a fault of mine but what happened to the person who called me over the phone to put us on a break?  She was acting like that never happened.  ""You think that people aren't allowed to be mad at you, that they need to walk on eggshells"".  ""No"", I said, ""you have a right to be mad...but being mad doesn't give you a free pass to chew into someone for 20 minutes without a breath, calling them names like idiot, moron, child, etc"".  This went in circles until I hung up.  It was awful.  
  
The following weekend she calls me while I'm at a friends house.  ""I have something to confess.  I developed a crush on Chris (co-worker).  He was checking me out a lot and I was flattered.  That night when I didn't come home...I had a few drinks in me.  We kissed a bunch.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  We kissed.  I told him it was weird for me because I had a boyfriend.  and now I know how much of a jerk he is, he means nothing to me, I could never date a guy like him."" 
  
 I was in shock.  In 10 years, I've never touched another girl. Ever.  Never even considered it.  At all.  How could she do this.  
  
""You're not a bad person."" I told her.  I don't know why but it was my first thought.  ""I just can't believe it.  You kept it from me.  Then you lied to me when I asked you"".  ""I didn't think he was worth it because he was such a jerk.  Please don't throw away 10 years of our relationship.""  She starts crying.  ""Please listen"".  I listened.  I wanted to throw up but she spent 40 minutes telling me the story of how she realized he is a jerk.  ""It doesn't matter that he's a jerk.  There's a bigger issue here.""  ""I don't want you to think we went on break over him"", she tells me ""he's not the reason, we already have issues"".  She proceeds to tell me about some of my faults.  I scream at her ""are you fucking kidding me?"".  I told her to give me space.  I went to a friend's house.  She texts ""I'm sorry.  I love you.""  She then tells me ""don't tell our friends.  please don't make them hate me"".  So I didn't.
  
The next night she texts me that when I have kept things from her in the past, (getting drunk behind her back when I was having an anxiety attack, something I immediately sought therapy for) that it was worse than ""what she did"".  I told her it's not ok for her to throw that in my face.  She says ""I feel like you're making me the bad guy"".  Seriously?    
  
Another night goes by.  Once again, sitting alone in a dark room in my friend's apartment.  We text again.  I tell her how hurt I am.  That she did this but I want to take some time and work through this.  She tells me that I've been a baby since we went on break.  She tells me me to ""man up"".  To ""stop crying"".  She tells me it wouldn't matter if anyone found out what she did because ""that's not why we went on break in the first place"".  She then tells me she doesn't regret lying to me, because it ""Wasn't the right time to tell me.""  that I couldn't handle it.  I told her that her treating me this way and calling me ""baby"" and other things isn't helping.  ""You need to treat me better"".  ""There you go again, thinking that people aren't allowed to be mad at you.  Be a man.  Stop texting like a fucking teenager and call me.""  I called her but I was crying hysterically.  She accused me of ""playing the victim card"".  It's been 2 days since she confessed.  ""You've been playing the victim for ten years, ever since your parents deserted you"".  I said ""this conversation is over!"" and hung up.  She said the most hurtful thing she could possibly think of.
  
Where do I go from here?  I spent all last night crying.  It hurts so fucking much.  I have been with her for so long.  I love her so much.  Why is she doing this?  Why is she still talking to me like this?  I want to disappear forever.  Someone please.  Help me.

It was innocent for a long time until I started getting attention from guys on the site who told me I was hot and wanted to see more. Being a lonely 14 year old girl and loving the attention, I started doing live ""shows"" just of me playing with my boobs and fingering myself. I loved the attention and I loved the idea of guys jerking off to me. It made me feel great.

Well, being naive, I didn't think about how these nerdy tech savvy guys had programs that could record these webcam sessions. One day, one of the guys sent me a link to a website where my videos were posted. He told me he found my myspace because it was linked to the same email and he was going to send the link of the website to all of my friends and family if I didn't continue to do private shows for him. Luckily, being 14, I had one of those whore accounts on myspace where you just try to get as many friends as you can, and the email address linked to my webcam account was not the same email I used for my personal myspace account. So fortunately I was able to block him with none of my friends or family seeing these incriminating videos. I was terrified so I deleted the account just as a precaution. I never did another video again. I thought it was all over with and had forgotten about it and told myself the videos of me probably didn't make it far on the internet...until last summer.

I'm almost 21 now, and I was at work in the morning setting up when 2 people with very official looking badges knocked on the front door before we were open. My manager went to check it out, and walked over to me and said ""It's for you"" I freaked out. I had no idea what it was about. I opened the door and they had me step outside. They told me they were from the Department of Homeland Security and had to ask me a few questions. They asked me about a webcam site I had used in 2005 or 2006. They asked me how old I was then and if I had ever made any pornographic videos. I told them yes, mortified. They told me they had found a couple of videos of me that have widely circulated the internet and had made multiple arrests because older men were watching the videos of me. They asked me if I would like to verify if it was me in the videos (which they had copied onto a DVD) but I said no because I was sure it was. They knew everything about me. Where I lived, where I work, the names of everyone in my family, and they even had a copy of my old myspace page. They told me I wasn't in any trouble and just wanted to know where the computer was that I made the videos on to confiscate it and make sure there were no more, but my family had already thrown it out.

So now there are multiple videos of 14-year-old me circulating on porn sites all over the internet. Every day I wonder if anyone has ever noticed me as the teen girl they saw in a video once. I wonder if my guy friends or guys I went to high school with have seen it or will see it. I am constantly paranoid that someone is going to recognize me or that I am being watched by homeland security. I am paranoid that future jobs I apply for will do intensive background checks and that the videos may show up. I am absolutely exposed. The worst part is that normally with child pornography, the child is filmed by an adult. But I chose to do this to myself.

1298128274.0,121,self.confession,foiid,My grade school friend ran away and they never found her,149,28,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/foiid/my_grade_school_friend_ran_away_and_they_never/,"I think about her quite often.

Carol was always the strange girl. She had some kind of muscle tremor disorder and shook all the time people picked on her and made fun of her. I was an oddball too so we were friends though strained at times. Both of us struggled to not be the most hated and most teased girl in our class so our friendship was base on mutual understanding of how much school life sucked. The summer of 7th grade we hung out a lot and became decent friends. We trusted each other and talked on the phone all the time. She told me that her uncle had been molesting her since she was 4 or 5 (dont remember exactly but young) and that her mom knew but either couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it. That was a shock to me but I was 13 and had no clue wtf I could do about it if her mom and grandma knew and couldn't help her. Anyhow, we kept hanging out that summer but before the next school year she moved. We still talked on the phone all the time though.



She had the same problems at her new school. Everybody picked on her and thought she was weird. She ran away from home for a couple of weeks and the police found her and brought her back. She ran away 2 more times that I knew of and for whatever reason.. likely me getting caught up in my own school drama, we stopped calling each other. I never thought to think why. One day, bored and not having anybody else to call I called her and her mom grilled me about where she was, what I knew about some guy she was dating. I knew nothing of any of this and ended up hanging up on her because she was freaking out so bad. It was weird but I didn't really understand what was going on.


About a month later Carol called me from a pay phone, or at least she said it was a pay phone. She told me that she was staying with a guy and the general area they were staying and that she was having sex with lots of people. I didn't believe her. I thought she was just trying to make it sound like she was finally being accepted by a group of people and was rubbing it in that I still wasn't. Then a few weeks later she called me again and said that she was now having sex with people for money and that some of them were old enough to be her dad. At this point I was just kind of annoyed with her ""stories"" and told her she needed to call her mom and go back home and hung up on her.


I switched schools and made a bunch of friends and totally forgot about Carol. Then maybe 6 months later or so her mom called me crying asking if I knew where Carol was and if I could help her find her. I told her she had called me a long time ago but that I didn't know where she was.


To my knowledge today, they never found her. Knowing what I know now (14 years later) about the world and how fucked up it can be, I feel like I should have done something more to help her mom find her. I should have called her mom after the first time Carol called from the pay phone and let her know where she said she was staying. Maybe they could have found her.


Sometimes I still google her name. Search for her in the directory of missing and exploited children. I've never found anything on her. No missing persons report, no death certificate, no high school crap from classmates or facebook. She just disappeared. One of my facebook ""friends"" is a cop in the city she went missing in and sometimes I think of asking her to check into it to see if she can find any record of anything on this girl, but I think that might be a bit creepy. In the mean time, I go about my life knowing that my friend is probably dead and I did nothing to stop that.



tldr; My friend ran away from home and ended up shacking up with a guy who pimped her out. She called me and told me where she was but I never told anybody. They never found her and 14 years later there is no record of her anywhere on the internet.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_foiid,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/foiid/my_grade_school_friend_ran_away_and_they_never/,

He'd always been cheating on her, they'd fight constantly. I think he was a sex addict, didn't know it then obviously.

At first we lived in a small apartment and I slept on a cot in the living room. He brought women over and they'd have sex either in the living room or in his room, but either way he made no effort to hide it, not even closing the door. Another thing that didn't occur to me then was that he insisted my cot had to be in this one corner of the living room, which put me in a position where I could see into his bedroom and where a drunk woman stumbling into a strange apartment would probably not see me.

By the time I was 14 he and some girls had sex openly in front of me, and he'd get them to let me play with their tits or whatever. He told them I was 17. Soon enough he got a girl who agreed to sleep with me and him. He saw it as more of an instructional thing, I guess and he'd tell me how to do it better the whole time. He was very particular. Eventually I brought a girlfriend home and he was nice at first, then demanded to know when I was gonna talk her into screwing him. I had already asked and she said no, so I told him that and he got pissed. He kicked me out a few months later.

We've made up since then and I see him quite a bit. He's still a lecherous poonhound but he's no longer smooth and sexy (back when I was growing up, he was, all of my friends moms had a huge crush on him). He's now a drunk and a cokehead, lost all his muscles and is generally a loser.

While I realize this counts as sexual abuse legally, I vacillate on how I feel about it. People tend to react poorly, so I don't talk about it really. It seems normal in my head but when I say it, it sounds creepy, and it sounds even creepier that I don't really see it as bad.

Update to the previous post (here, http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/14lor0/im_in_love_with_my_prison_penpal_who_ive_never_met/)

Today my friend and I traveled to the prison my pen pal is in (just over 2 hours away). We met up with my pen pals father who flew down to visit his son from New Jersey. He was very nice and kept telling me how great I was for taking the time to write to his ""idiot son"" and every time they talk on the phone he can tell when he got a letter from me that day because he sounded so much happier.  

The atmosphere of the visiting area was very light and easy going. It's a minimum security facility, but plenty of barbed wire and fences. I never felt unsafe at any time, but was hyper aware of everyone around me. There were kids running all over playing with toys the prison provided, laughing with their dad's, and having a good time. 

My pen pal, lets call him K, was nothing like I thought he would be. He is much smaller than the pictures of him pre-prison. I blame shitty prison food and plan on fatten him up the day he gets out. K was quiet, I think he was nervous. He has the most wonderful brown soulful eyes I can stare into all day. We stayed from 9am to 3pm (the start and end of visiting hours) but it felt like an hour. We talked about everything and nothing. We laughed a lot. Even got our picture taken. They are very strict about public displays of affection, but you get two hugs (a hello and goodbye), and K and I took full advantage, and hugged for a while. I can't wait to see him again, and I'm ticking the days down until he gets out for good.

Confession time with a throwaway.,146,29,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/zjv0g/drinking_and_thinking_about_my_time_as_a_cop/,"Back in the early 1990s a few politicians in the [south Florida] area made names for themselves by demonizing all forms of adult entertainment. Everything from adult movie theaters to strip-clubs became a huge target; protests outside of these many establishments became commonplace and the media ate it up. Eventually a special task force was set up to confront the “problem”. Of course, those of us in law enforcement knew it was all politics. We all knew that these businesses weren't going to go away but hey, the powers that be wanted a few stories in the press to show that they were taking the issue seriously.

I was one of the officers put on the task force. Why? Not because of seniority or anything like that. Hell I was so green I still bought the coffee. No, I was put on the task force because the lead detective on the force was my godfather. Me, a total rookie with all of a year's experience at the department, jokingly asked him at a family gathering if I could be reassigned to surveil some of the local strip-clubs. It was honestly a joke. But the following Monday during the daily run-down I was told that I had been reassigned.

For the next six months I was no longer in uniform. Instead I spent most of my duty-hours dressed as a regular Joe sitting inside of strip-clubs and tipping dancers with taxpayer money. My mission? To try and get the “dancers” to either sell me drugs or better yet agree to have sex with me. Busting them for prostitution was preferred because the laws in Florida were strict: if it could be demonstrated that an establishment was an accessory in the propagation of illicit activities then they could be sued by the D.A. as a co-conspirator, lose their liquor license, and eventually be shut down.

Busting dancers for drugs was easy but after my first few I was rotated back into regular patrol. When I asked my godfather about this he explained that the D.A. wasn't interested in drugs. He wanted prostitution busts. Those types of take-downs would help him shut down some of the many *many* strip-clubs. I'll be honest, I fucking hated patrol. Hated it a lot. That's one of the many reasons why I promised I'd refocus my efforts if I was put back on the task force.

And I sure did. Time was I wasn't a fatass old man so getting the dancers to like me was easy. I'd get them in the champagne room, flirt a bit, and wait for them to make the offer. Usually it was while they were grinding down on me and they'd say something like, “For another $200 I can give you a real, real good time...”

I would play dumb. Had to. Then they'd usually get blunt: “$200 and I'll suck your cock.” That's when I would bust them and make my collar.

I never felt bad about any of that. Hell, only once did a dancer flip out on me. Most of the girls would just roll their eyes and accept the inevitable. They knew they'd be out of jail come morning and were smart enough not to cause a scene. The funniest thing is that I ended up busting the same girls several times. It was as though they wanted to get caught or they just didn't care enough to remember who arrested them in the past. I arrested one girl four separate times at three different clubs. She never remembered me, not once!

Only one of those clubs ever got shut down though. Despite all the pressure from on high there was just never enough proof that the prostitution met the legal definition of accessory. Too many of the girls just didn't fall for our traps (seriously: I'd guess that only 1 in 8 of the girls ever even hinted at prostitution and half of those were too smart to ever make an offer) and the club owners could always point out that they had strict rules about such behavior anyway. To my knowledge not one of my collars ever admitted that the owners knew what was going on either. 

So yeah, we put a lot of prostitutes in jail but their employers always got off scott free. Well, except for one place: we did manage to shut down a club but that had nothing to do with prostitution. It had to do with them employing several underage girls as dancers. I wasn't in on that particular bust but a few friends of mine were. It was a pretty big local story: “Is your daughter taking off her clothes for money? News at 11!” that sort of thing. In the end the club owners plead out and for the next few years the boarded up building was an eyesore before it was eventually replaced by a strip mall.

Shortly after that “success” the task force was quietly disbanded and I returned to patrol.

Oh-- I came here to confess something didn't I? Okay. During my brief time on the task force I let more than a few girls off with a warning. I still vividly remember the look in their eyes when I went into my wallet and pulled out my badge instead of money. I honestly got off on that look of total fear. In my defense I was definitely not the only one who did that but still, it's one of the reasons why I am ashamed of my previous career. When you see a 20-something child cry and other you... other things... just to stay out of jail? Yep yep. You begin to feel really shitty.

We moved in together already and do everything together. At the beginning of this year and a little before it, I had started working out and losing weight.  I've lost fifteen pounds in six months going from 210 to 195.  My girlfriend, whom we are thinking of getting married, has been gaining the same about of weight I've been losing if not more.

She is a few years younger than me, just turning 20 this year and me being 22 this year as well.  She was always small, and even had smaller boobs (B cup).  I loved her body though.  But I look at her now and I can't stop **STARING** at her stomach, at her sides.  Her boobs are a large c cup now which started happening awhile back and we were fine with.  But her gut pushes out past her waist now and pushes against her shirt and it absolutely disgusts me.  

I don't know how to tell her she's gaining weight without being an asshole, but I can't stop thinking about it, I can't stop seeing it, and it's honestly making me lose attraction to her.

I live pretty far away now, and that was the first time I'd been back for over a year.  My girlfriend couldn't come with me, so I'd just gone from having sex several times a week whenever I wanted it to not having any at all.  I stayed with my parents for awhile, then went and stayed with my sister, so by week two, I was almost a month into the forced celibacy, and hornier than I can ever remember being.

My sister is just hot - all my friends have said so.  Add to my horniness the fact that she walks around the house in her underwear and constantly complained about how sexually frustrated she was because she hadn't had sex in a long time.

One night, I had a sex dream about her, and woke up right in the middle with a raging hard on.  I decided to jerk off, and at first tried to think of something other than her.  Of course, that meant that I could think of nothing else *but* her, and I wound up jerking off while thinking about my sister for the first time in my life.  (I feel like this is something of an accomplishment, because I have several attractive sisters and I was 28 by then) I felt (at least a little) wretched and hated myself.  I couldn't fall back asleep, and I couldn't think of anything but how sexy she is.

As even the worst ideas have a tendency to do when you're alone in the dark with nothing to convince you otherwise, it started to seem like the perfect idea.  She was sexually frustrated, I was hornier than I'd ever been.  I've never cheated on anybody, but after a couple hours alone in the dark, this started to seem like maybe it wouldn't *really* be cheating.  Maybe it would just be my sister and I, who have always been pretty close, just getting a bit closer - while solving both of our problems.  She also wouldn't have to sleep some random fuckhead, and would be guaranteed to get fucked and eaten really well.  (Not to brag, but I know I'm good at it.)  She is also the kind of person who seems to have absolutely no boundaries.  She will tell me ANYTHING.  I know what song was playing when she lost her virginity.  (Toadies - Possum Kingdom)  (Just so you know - The Toadies rock)  I never managed to fall back asleep.

In the morning, she asked if I slept okay on the couch, and I said, ""No, not at all, but not because the couch isn't comfortable.""  She asked why, so I told her I'd had a sex dream.  She immediately asked for details, because that's just how she is.  I took a deep breath and said, ""Well... it was about you.""  She didn't really seem weirded out or anything.  She just said, ""Oh.  Well I'm flattered.  You want any coffee?""  The fact that she wasn't creeped out, and was in fact ""flattered"" just kinda finalized my intention.  I was going to try and find a way to fuck her.

A few evenings later, we were hanging out watching movies and getting drunk.  At some point, I decided to go for it.  I had been thinking about how to go about it without ruining our relationship, freaking her the hell out, and having her run off and tell the whole family and my girlfriend.  I finally settled on, ""Ya know the dream I had about you?  I'm still having trouble dealing with it.... because I'm pretty sure I actually would if you wanted to.""  I felt like if I went into more detail about how it would be the perfect solution to our problems, she'd feel pressured and it would get weird.

When I told her, she just kinda laughed and said, ""Yeah, I kinda figured that when you told me.  Just don't ever try anything, and we're okay and I won't tell anybody.""  She went on to try to ease my mind by telling me she didn't think any less of me and it's not at all uncommon so I shouldn't feel bad about it.

Three days later, she met a guy and started fucking him and giving me the details.  Probably only giving me details to fuel my fantasies about her, because she likes to fuck with me.  None of this changed her dressing habits.  I honestly think she was walking around in her bra and panties more often those last couple weeks.  Some really sexy Victoria's Secret shit, too.

So, I didn't get to fuck her, but I managed to let her know I was up for it without fucking up anything between us.  And now I don't feel bad at all when I have fantasies about spanking her like the bad little girl she is.

You can ask me stuff I guess... 

*When I was about 7 My half sister left my families house and nobody in my family would tell me why. She was 16 at the time. I later found out (around the age of 18) that it was because she had started to use heroin and that my family sent her to some sort of rehab facility or something (my family is VERY hush hush about everything bad in our family. My mom had a major cancer scare without any of her children knowing) anyway, she got clean and came back to live with us, she got a job as a secretary at a doctors office, everything was going great. She met a guy around her age ( they were 21-22ish) and he ended up getting her pregnant and running off. She decided she was going to be a single mom and raise her daughter herself. We were all so proud of her! here she was being a responsible adult! My entire familiy rallied around her and helped her get all the government assistance and help we could (baby sitting, threw her a baby shower, bought diapers and baby clothes, etc.) 
*flash forward 5 years and my niece is now 5 almost 6, my sister has been seeing this guy ""Jeff"" for about 3 years My niece calls him ""daddy"" and everything. When Jeff and my sister first started dating he had a job as a used car salesmen and he made pretty decent money but, less than 6 months after they got together he ended up losing his job (they were very vague about how it happened and nobody in my family pressed the issue.) and started going on unemployment.  About a 6 months ago through a slip of my nieces tongue that ""daddy used to do the bad stuff like mommy."" I personally took this as smoking weed which isn't a huge deal to me as long as it's away from the kids.
 *As the months go by jeff starts to act more and more erratic and slowly so does my sister. we find out that my sister lost her job months ago and hasn't told us, the money my mom has been sending her to have my niece go to a preschool program hasn't been going to the school and whereas my mom used to spend at least 2-3 days a week either having my niece over or baby sitting so my sister and Jeff can go out on a date. nowadays we don't talk to her hardly at all and when I go to pick up my niece to baby sit only Jeff meets me at the door. I haven't seen my sister in weeks.
 *The last time i did was valentines day (my niece is going through the princess phase so we did a whole ""knight for a princess"" thing for her.) Now my sisters skin has always been almost flawless. Maybe a blemish or two here and there but never anything like what I saw that day. Her skin looked diseased that's how bad it was. On top of that, both her and Jeffs teeth looked like they were rotting out of there skulls and halfway through the ""party"" they both left to their car (We have a large house so their car was on one end of the house while the party was on the other end. So nobody knows what they did/were doing.) Now, I've never used H but I have friends who have (We live in a town known for it's drug production/usage can't go to highschool here without it touching your life.) and they we're acting like people who had just used. My sister was even nodding out on the couch.
 *So I told my mom what i was thinking and she had the same thoughts as me and we decided she would go over to their house unannounced to surprise my niece with a trip to the zoo, which she loves. When she came in, the place was a fucking mess, she made it sound like a scene from the show hoarders though she didn't actually see any brown or paraphernalia, Jeff was passed out on the couch and my sister was nowhere to be found. When my niece went to say goodbye apparently she jumped from the top of the couch onto Jeff and he didn't even stir at all from his sleep. I'm pretty sure he is using and that he got my sister back into using again. Honestly, I love my sister but if that's the path she's chosen then There's not much i can do to stop her. I just don't want my niece in a situation like that. I don't know, I feel like I am betraying my own blood by doing this but nobody else in my family is willing to do anything. My mom is too scared my sister will find out and my dad is too busy providing for our entire extended family that he is just too exhausted. I have to do it but I feel so fucking terrible, I know it's for the best but she still is my sister.

Since we were 14 or so we've developed a strange bond in which we occasionally masturbate together and help each other out by giving each other handjobs (not on a regular basis... maybe every 4-5 months or so). I am 100% sure I'm not gay, as I currently have a girlfriend and am happier than ever, nevertheless doing this always gave me a strange rush of excitement. We've always been very comfortable with eachother and have established that this doesn't weird us out.

However he said since its the last time we were going to do this we should make it sort of special. And he offered to give me a blowjob.

AMA,138,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18qj5t/ive_been_supporting_my_drunkloser_boyfriend_for/,"I'm 22 years old and he's 31. I moved in with him when I was 18 because my home life wasn't that great and I thought I was in love. Shortly after moving in he had an accident at his work. At first money wasn't a problem: he had this supplemental insurance thing that basically made it so that he was still earning as much as he had been while working. After a few months that went away but he still couldn't work so all he had was worker's comp. At that point I took a part time job at an animal shelter to help pay the bills and eventually had to cut back my college courses a lot because the commute/work-load was killing me. Then his workman's comp went away too and he filed for disability benefits.

It was around that time that I started to notice the drinking. I had ignored it for a long time but couldn't anymore. Whenever he got his check he would go out to the bar and come home stinking drunk. Even when he didn't have a check he found money to at least buy cheap whisky and stay loaded all day while he sat around the house.

Two years ago I got a call from a number I didn't recognize. My awesome boyfriend had apparently gotten so drunk *at a fucking stripclub* that they were refusing to let him leave unless he called a cab. But guess what? Genius didn't have money for a cab. So I had to go and pick him up. Obviously I was furious but he was so trashed I couldn't even yell at him at the time. 

The next day we had a huge fight: I didn't like that he'd been hiding the fact that he was going to stripclubs. I didn't like that he was wasting all our money there. I didn't like how he was drinking away my paychecks and his disability payments. I didn't make enough money at the shelter to support his fucking drunken bar-life! His response was, ""Go to the club and get work there if you want money so bad.""

That's exactly what I did. That very day, angry and upset as hell, I went to the club I had picked him up from the day before and asked if they were hiring. They were, but it was a longer process to get the work than I had imagined. But two weeks later I walked out on stage in my stilettos for the first time.

Avery, my boyfriend, knows I work there and doesn't care. He actually brags about it to friends sometimes and even comes to see me dance once in awhile but thankfully not that much. What he doesn't know is that in addition to stripping for money I've been having sex for money, to.

Basically I give hand jobs to guys in the chamaign room. I learned early on that was basically expected and a great way to get bigger tips. But I also meet guys in thier cars in the parking lot to either give head or fuck depending on what they're willing to pay; those are always quick ones during my breaks. If a customer or customers really have some serious cash I agree to meet him/them at their house/motel/whatever after work and do pretty much anything depending on the price. I also give a lot of these men my dummy-cell number and have built up a sizable client list. When they call and I'm not at work or school I arrange to meet them.

Meanwhile I live this double-life at home. I laugh about my job to Avery and brag about how easy it is (it's the hardest job I've ever had) because men just throw money at me to see my tits. He has no idea that I've been unfaithful to him. He often says to his friends that he's my first and I'm his last. They think that's hilarious. I just bite my tongue because the truth would ruin everything.

Do I feel bad? No. Not for cheating on him. If I hadn't started this we would have been evicted a long time ago. What I do pays the bills and more.

Do I feel bad? Yes. For living a lie. None of my family or friends know that I even strip let alone sell myself for sex. And every single day I have to pretend to Avery that all I do is wiggle my ass in a guy's lap to make a few bucks. I hate lying but my work has turned me into a habitual liar.

Do I feel bad? Yes. For not being able to do the smart thing and just leave the asshole and re-focus on school and my future.

1309388935.0,120,self.confession,icqdj,"I have never shared this with anyone except for my SO, and I barely told him anything. Now I want to tell my entire story. ",146,26,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/icqdj/i_have_never_shared_this_with_anyone_except_for/,"A few years ago, I was started seeing this guy. I was 16, he was 19. He will be referred to as 'D'.  Everything with 'D' was going well for the first few months. Nothing spectacular, just kind of normal. At about the 3 month mark, I notice that 'D' starts to get angry at me for no reason. These bouts of anger would go as quickly as they came, and would always be apologized for later. 'D' was also very aggressive in bed, and if I didn't want sex, he would usually go on with it anyway, and it would take me crying and kicking him off of me to get him to stop.

After putting up with these sudden rages and aggressiveness for a couple of months, I stood up for myself. I told him that he couldn't treat me that way, and that I was going to leave if he kept it up. 'D' responded with a punch to my ribs. He apologized within a couple of minutes, rattling off the ""I didn't know what I was doing...won't happen ever again...blah blah blah"" speech. Being a naive teenager who thought she was in love, I forgave him.

Fast forward a couple of weeks later. We are at a party, and 'D' is drunk. I am informed of this, and am told by the host to take care of him or we have to leave. I find 'D' out in the front yard, yelling at people and taking a couple swings at one guy. I apologized, took 'D' upstairs inside, and tried to get him to lay down on a couch. He wouldn't listen, and kept trying to walk out the door. I pushed him back on to couch, rinse, repeat. After a few minutes of this, I pushed 'D' back onto the couch, and he slammed his head against the arm. He immediately jumped up and came after me, looking enraged. I backed away, trying to talk him down. Too late I realized I had backed myself *away* from the door, and now 'D' stood between me and the way out. He got to me, and started trying to take swings at me, but he was drunk and not coordinated, so he missed. At this point in time, I am pushing, punching, kicking, clawing, etc. 

I guess it would be worth mentioning here that when I am scared, I choke up, and about 90% of the time cannot get a scream to come out. Every woman in the situation's worst fear. 

The fighting back and forth continued, all the while me trying to calm myself enough to get a scream out. Before I can do it, 'D' shoved me hard enough to make me stumble, and I lost my balance. Where did I fall? Why, the *corner*, made into a 3 sided pen by the end of the couch. When 'D' realized I couldn't move now, he got *mean*. He started to kick me in the ribs, legs, back and arms. After a while of this, I found my voice again and started to try and make noise. When 'D' saw this, he got on his knees and started to choke me. I was beginning to get tunnel vision when we both heard someone coming towards the room. 'D' jumps off of me, goes to the door, and told whoever it was that I had had too much to drink, and he was trying to get me to lay down. I ""had been fighting him about it"", which explained why I was on the floor &amp; any noise heard. The person at the door left, and that was the end of it. 'D' picked me up, put me on the couch, kissed me, and left the room. I passed out. 

The next day, I went to see 'D' and figure out what the fuck happened. I got no answer, and instead made things worse for myself. 'D' decided that I needed to be taught my place. Within 10 minutes of me walking in the door, he managed to gag me, drag me to his room by my hair, and get all of my clothes off. He forced himself on me, laughing at me crying the whole time. He slapped me repeatedly during this, and afterwards kicked me in the side. He went into another room for a bit while I stayed on his floor and cried. He left about an hour later. I gathered my things, left, and never had any contact with him again. He never tried to see me or talk to me again, which I do not understand, but am unbelievably grateful for. 

The end result of this time in my life was/is: 

* about 23 deep bruises all over my body, the size varying from fist to foot

* I think a rib may have been fractured, but I can't be sure, as I never went to the doctor

* slight bruising around my neck from choking, which I hid with scarves (it was winter when that happened)

* chunks of hair missing from being dragged down hall

* severe anxiety issues

* severe trust issues

Surprisingly, this did not send me into a spiraling depression. It IS depressing at times, yes, but I do not let it control my life. It did not make me hate men or become sex-shy, either. I have had a couple of relationships since then, and am now in a relationship with the man that I hope to marry (we have a wonderful sex life). All in all, I feel that I came out of that experience with more of my sanity than most women do, and for that I am grateful.


That is what happened to me, and it feels good to share it. Even though it wasn't something I personally did [as per r/confession rules], but it was still *my* confession. Thank you for reading this.

**Edit:** I never went to anyone about this because I was ashamed about what had happened. By the time I realized that I should have sucked it up and gone to the police, I was almost completely healed up.

I have terrible luck, that's it. Right as things are looking good and I have some savings up, BOOM it all goes to shit. I moved across the country to be with a girl I love and I have faced nothing but struggles here. I have a job as a stocker at a pet store, and it's rough. We lift about 10,000 pounds and usually walk about 6 miles in one shift moving from the front of the store to the warehouse. ""Shit, that doesn't sound too bad."" some of you might be thinking and you're right, except I make 8.00 an hour. I pay all of my bills and have no room for error. However, I got sick 3 weeks ago and missed 3 of my shifts and after I paid my phone, internet, health insurance etc. I realized I was 400 dollars behind. My landlord is understanding and gave me some time to come up with the money, but his brother died yesterday and he really needs that money. I told him I could have it by monday, but have no idea how I'm going to come up with it. If I can't come up with it I will lose my house and the girl I love. I was walking around and saw a couple of business' I think I could get the money from. I'm terrified, this isn't me. This isn't who I am. I try and help everybody I can, I stay late at work and come in early, I work hard. Lately though it just seems like one big shit tsunami I can't keep my head above, I can breath and taste the clean air for a split second, then everything is murky and reeks. I can't let myself become homeless, and I can't lose the one person I've ever felt anything for. She knows somethings up too, she's been asking me why I'm so stressed lately, I just tell her it's all work stuff.  I will do whatever I can for this to be fixed, if I have to rob a store or suck a dick. I don't care at this point.

I think the key elements are, what it was about my friend that would ask me to do it, what it was about me that made me agree to do it, and what it was about him that meant he was still a virgin at 20.

She and I were both in the Army at the time, we'd known each other since we joined. We'd done a lot of stuff together sexually, not as lovers but we'd had threesomes and done various other sexual stuff alongside each other but not neccessarily as partners.

She had a very casual view of sex and to be honest I had as well. She saw the fact that her brother was incredibly bad with women (and actually socially with anyone) as a problem that she could use me to fix.

In many ways I had an equally casual view of sex, at the time I thought it was kind of funny and wierd that she'd ask, but it didn't really bother me. Plus for various reasons I felt obligated to her.

As for him, well he really was shockingly bad socially. With everyone but especially with women. 

Without dwelling too much on the sex it was pretty bad. Though on a non sexual level I found it quite excting in some ways, mainly because I wasn't used to being dominant with men.

I thought it would take an hour or so but I ended up spending the night with him. Mainly because the first few times were so bad, I wanted to stick at it untill we had one positive experience. For the first while he was more interested in playing amateur Gynocologist than actually fucking me.

Eventually with a lot of prompting from me he made a decent stab at fucking me. For obvious reasons he found doggy style easier than making eye contact.

Anyway I was at his wedding years later, he married a horrible woman, who managed to go through the whole ceremony without smiling. It made me smile that I'd shagged him first.

I kind of have mixed views about the whole thing. Sexually it did nothing for me, and it was pretty terrible. However it was pretty exciting and I felt kind of powerful.. AMA

Edit: After reading the rules of this Subreddit I've stuck AMA at the end of it just because I don't want to appear as if I'm not willing to have my version of what happened Questioned.

We have zero intimacy, and every casual conversation has the added danger of escalating into an argument because we disagree on so many things.

It's been a really rough year for me. My husband left me for a man. A few months after my divorce I started seeing a man (the man I couldn't have dreamed to be more perfect for me) that I fell for HARD, and he emotionally devastated me. He broke up with me, didn't give me any real reason as to why - just said ""You missed the part where I get to do whatever I damn well please."" 

I met this man, we're going to call him Dan, on a dating website. He lives in a town about 2 hours away. He was very handsome but I wasn't emotionally drawn to him and his very sexual messages made me think he wasn't looking for anything serious. We started text flirting Friday, leading to him threatening to drive up that night. I didn't think he would. Friday night, around 11PM, he texted me his room number at a local hotel. 

I decided to go. I figured I might have a good time. I've never done the 'one night stand' thing, as long as we were safe - what's the worst that could happen?

Now I had been joking with my friends since my boyfriend dumped me that the next guy was going to be in trouble. That I would punish him for everything. When I arrived at the hotel I had an idea: I have always been submissive with sex - and tonight I wanted control. I wanted to abuse this man. I texted him ""I'm very rough, is that ok?"". He texted back ""The safeword is blueberry"", so I assumed he had done this before.

We had the awkward introductions. He kissed me. I broke the kiss and slapped him hard across the face. ""Did I give you permission to fucking kiss me?"" He hung his head and apologized, got on his knees and asked how he could make it up to me...

I'll gloss over *everything* I did to this poor man, but for the next three hours I made him my bitch. I was beyond rough, it was violent. His ass and face and neck were bright red. I made him lick his own ejaculate off my breasts. I shoved a small shampoo bottle up his ass, without asking. I have never been domineering in sex, ever. It felt so good! 

We were on round three, I was riding him and choking him and he started hyperventilating. He got very pale. He asked for some water. He felt light-headed. He said he felt a lot of pressure in his chest and I asked if he wanted me to call an ambulance. He was saying something about how he shouldn't have taken some pills and then he yelped in pain, grabbing his chest. I called 911 and got him an aspirin from my purse. I waited with him until the paramedics came and then I left. 

I spent all day Saturday not knowing how he was or what happened. He finally texted me late last night. It was a heart attack. He had taken a viagra, which he wasn't prescribed. 

I'm not confessing to brag. I have no one else to tell. I don't want my friends thinking I'm the kind of girl that fucks strangers she meets on the internet. I'm confessing because, well, I think I should feel worse. He could have DIED! And I'm laughing to myself about making him suck my toes and drink my urine. And I want to do it again. I want to make every man I see pay. I'm sick of being nice and sweet and being figuratively pissed on - now I want to (literally) piss on them.

I've always been the good girl, the rational, kind, even, perfect girl. I'm fucking done. I want to be the crazy, slutty girl. I want to make men cry. I want them to pay.

Growing up I knew I was always attracted to boys. However I was scared of the consequences of it. I lived a fairly sheltered life, and never really had friends. I was molested and sexually abused when I was 5 by a teenage male neighbor. He made me suck his dick in a movie rental parking lot, and then he ""peed"" in my mouth.

My curiosity started growing more in my early teenage years, 11-13. At around this time my grandmother was dying, so my family was together a lot. Sometimes I would have to be with my special needs cousin, ""Jay."" Jay was mentally handicapped (not down syndrome). I am not sure what his sexual maturity was. 

One time I was at my aunt's house and I told him he should take a bath. When he got naked I ended up touching him a little bit because the curiosity piqued me greatly, and one time I ended up putting his penis in my mouth for like 2 seconds. This only happened twice.

The shame consumes me every single day,171,55,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/10v56r/i_bullied_my_ex_into_having_an_abortion_when_i/,"I'm not sure how this is going to be taken. I dated my high-school girlfriend from when we were 15 and until we were 19. We had a very innocent relationship. We were each others's first everything. No trust issues and really just a beautiful relationship. I've never come to having anything close to that since. 

We ended up going long distance for University. I went to school a couple hours away and she stayed at our hometown. We would see each other every couple weeks. We weren't on any birth control and we used a combination of withdrawal and timing her cycle. Hardly perfect. I becae an awful boyfriend too. Started to drink, do drugs, and party. None of which I did before. I lightly cheated on her during this time period. 

Sarah found out she was pregnant around November. My immediate reaction was total panic. I didn't want to be a father and I didn't want to give up the partying, the coke, the booze, and everything. The idea of being a parent was the last thing I wanted. Sarah was just as scared but seemed sure she wanted to keep the baby. 

Something snapped in me. I lost my soul. I tortured her into that abortion. I bullied her and told her it wasn't mine since we were long distance. I said I wouldn't be there for her baby. That I would tell everyone she cheated on me and that it wasn't mine. Fucked up because I was cheating on her. I kept telling her that the baby was nothing. It couldn't feel a thing. I told her I would never speak to her again if she didn't have the abortion. I broke her spirit. 

Once it was done I could see how much it wrecked her. We were only together for a month longer and I broke up with her because I couldn't handle her pain. I was such a coward. 

I've cleaned up my life a lot since then but I know nothing I do can make up for the gravity of the sins I committed before. I haven't used anything in 3 years. No alcohol, drugs, anything. I've found God... but reddit isn't the place for that type of talk. I still think about the abortion every single day. I think of what if. I see Sarah now and see what a wreck she is and I'm convinced its because of me. I basically emotionally raped her. To kill my own child. Who does that? I'm too much of a coward to face Sarah. I know she hates me. I haven't told a soul about any of this.

Monday, he had emergency surgery to remove a blockage, which was a tennis ball sized tumor from his intestine, and they discovered that the cancer which they thought he'd beaten had metastasized throughout his liver, colon, and stomach. The doctors won't even give a long term prognosis, and the short term one isn't very optimistic.  

This is great news.  He's finally on his way out.  I couldn't have planned it better.  Last year, I told him to drop dead, and I meant it.  Getting hit by a bus or massive cardiac arrest would have been too easy. Since I was a kid, I had death fantasies about him, I plotted killing him, or him dying in extremely painful ways, so this is just about perfect.  

He came into our lives when I was 10, and the minute he and my mother began dating, he began kicking the shit out of me.  I was a super quiet, bookish fat kid, and a total punching bag.  He would get home from work, and I would flee like a rabbit to my bedroom and lock the doors.  He removed the lock from my bedroom door.  He took all the light bulbs out of my room for a year, because I stayed up too late reading once.  Because of him, I learned to throw a punch, and deflect them.  He was a drunk.  My mother married him because he was a steady paycheck, and she once, in a weird time of clarity confessed as much.  There was vague sexual abuse, like...inappropriate tickling, weird hugs...But the worst was him bursting in my room at all hours of the night, throughout my teens, and shining one of those million candle-watt flashlights on me while I was sleeping.  He would yank off my blankets, to do a ""bed check"".  I slept fully dressed.  

I went to live with my dad when I was 14, but came back when I was 16.  Stepfuck tried to raise a fist to me, my first week back, but I had the phone in my hand, with 9-1 dialed, and I stood him down.  That's when the physical abuse ended, and the mental abuse started.  He was possessive, and extremely controlling, to both my mother and I.  I left home when I was 19. His alcoholism became much worse, and soon after I moved out, he became addicted to Oxycontin, and went on disability, so much for that steady paycheck, Mom.  He's been mentally abusing my mother, since.  And now he's dying.  Slowly.  

I go to the hospital to sit with my mom. That's the stressful part.  My mother's sanity is slipping, and she's difficult to deal with.  She's a hoarder, and I know once he goes, she'll get so much worse.  I love her and I'm an only child. I told her my visiting wasn't for him, but to support her.  It's hard to seem sad, or grave.  When I need to put on a face, I think of how alone my mother will feel after he's gone, or what she must be going through, her husband of 25 years, dying.  That makes me sad, for her.

I am not self-loathing and I am open about my sexual orientation.  

But I am no more proud of being gay than I am about being tall or having blue eyes.   It is simply how I was born.   

I feel no connection with anyone marching in parades, attending festivals  or otherwise celebrating gay pride for the sake of gay pride.   

I have marched in AIDS Walks back when AIDS was largely considered and inaccurately called a gay disease.    I have attended protests in favor of marriage equality.   I have written congress asking to repeal DADT.   All because I don't think we should be marginalized, not because I feel people should be proud of being gay. 

But not being ashamed of who you are and expecting to be treated fairly is not akin in my mind to being proud you are gay. 

I can be proud that I worked hard and have a comfortable life.  I can be proud that my house and yard get compliments due to my efforts in those areas.   I am especially proud that I have maintained a monogamous relationship with a wonderful man for over 28 years so far.  

But Gay Pride celebrations with go-go boys on floats throwing condoms at the crowd, and chanting ""We're here, we're queer, get used to it!"" is SO not my style.       

I feel alienated by the participants.  I have no desire to be 'proud' of my sexual orientation.    I want to run from these events.   I don't want to be identified with the radical element who try to fit into their 7th grade gym shorts and claim Gay Pride.

I got really turned on by seeing her like that, and now I peek through the blinds at night sometimes, seeing if I can get another glimpse of her in something skimpy. One night I saw her in what looked like a satin night gown, and her hair was a little mussed. I got the impression she and her husband had just had sex. A big turn-on. She's the really goody girl Christian innocent type, and I would love to just defile her in every way.

I realize what a creep this makes me, especially since my wife and I are friends with them and our kids play together. If they knew I look in their window they would probably never speak to us again. I feel bad but I have no intention of stopping. I won't get caught--I'm very careful, and only part the blinds a tiny bit with the lights out.

I've been with my husband for 15 years and we have a son. A few years ago I caught him cheating. I've cheated in all past relationships but this one mattered and I have somehow remained faithful for 15 whole fucking years. After he was caught out, he admitted having cheated on two other occasions. I wanted revenge but for some dumb reason could not bring myself to break the record of fidelity I'd already achieved. 

When I found out he'd been cheating, I was a *former* heroin addict. The discovery of his extracurricular activities sent me spiraling into depression and relapse. When I started using heroin again, for some reason he joined in and I'll give him this - he claims he only trusts *me* to use hard drugs with. He's had opportunities to use in other circumstances and with other people but seems incredibly fearful to do so. He will not mix it or inject himself. I have to do it all for him.

The further I sunk into depression, the less I wanted to share. He's scared about using needles and so on, so unlike most junkies, he won't watch the mixing process to ensure he gets a fair deal. Usually for 0.1 of a gram, you use about 30-40 units of water. For the past 6 months he's thought he was getting 30 units of heroin (at least) per shot. In fact he has been getting about 8. The rest is injection water. He pays for what he thinks he's using. He boasts of how easily he can go without. He thinks he has fantastic self-control when in fact, he is barely even using drugs at all.

It started out innocent enough. I had a paper due in my psychology class that I didn't do, and was embarrassed about that, so I stayed home that day to avoid running into my professor. I figured I'd do my paper that day and turn it in next class.  
 
However, I procrastinated doing the paper all day and by the time my next psychology class rolled around, I still hadn't done my paper. I stayed home again, thinking I'd do the paper *next* class. I didn't, and by then I was too ashamed of skipping class to show up to class. 
 
I started skipping other classes too. I'd miss an assignment in calculus, so I wouldn't show up. I'd miss a group meeting with my Engineering class, so I wouldn't show up. Now it's been *FOUR WEEKS* and I haven't shown up to class at all. Not only that, but I haven't been keeping up on my work or doing my assignments. I've probably missed a test or two as well. 
 
I've been in this place before, too. I've failed six out of the ten classes I've taken at college, and I really wanted to turn that around this semester. I did the same thing last semester, and the semester before that, and the summer session before that... I have a problem. 
 
I've also been isolating myself from my friends and family for even longer, and haven't talked to anyone for months. I'm just so ashamed of my failures that I avoid talking to people whenever possible. I'm sure they either think I died or they have forgotten about me, since no one has made any attempts to find out where I am and why I haven't been talking to them. The only person I have to talk to is my dad, and he does what he can but it just isn't enough, ya know? 
 
It's getting hard to even go out of my house, and I think I'm starting to become paranoid that everyone secretly hates me and only tolerates me because they don't want to be rude. 
 
Reddit has become my only outlet for my loneliness and frustration, and so I spend hours just arguing with people. About anything. Even things I don't know anything about and don't even *care* about. I've recently realized that this hasn't done anything to fill that void, and instead all it has done is make me crave human interaction more. 
 
I know this is stupid and irrational, and accepting that has done nothing but made me angry at myself. I should just go to class, talk to my professor, do my assignments, get everything straightened out... but I can't. I know I should just talk to someone -- talk to *anyone* -- but I just can't fucking do it, and I think my anxiety has driven me into depression. 
 
I'm not eating right, I'm not sleeping right, I'm not getting any work done, I'm not interacting with people, and I'm not doing anything to make it better. I feel like I'm stuck in a downward spiral and I can't get out. I'm 19 years old for fucks sake, yet I feel like my life is already ruined. 
 
Anyway, that's my story. I'm too ashamed of my life to face the world.

**EDIT 4 DAYS LATER** I saw a counselor today, and I have an appointment with my doctor to get onto some medication. I'm not going to pass this semester because I missed too many classes, and I'm pretty bummed about that. However, I'm really hopeful that I can get through my anxiety problems with help.

I'm a guy and If I had to label myself I would say I'm bi. While attracted to both sexes, I find myself more sexually attracted to men, and more emotionally attracted to women (dating interest). But it is not black and white. This is not because of a fear of coming out- my closest friends wouldn't give two shits what my sexuality was nor would my family (which I am extremely lucky for).

I've 'hooked up' with both women and men. And while gay porn is very hot, hooking up with dudes is never as great as I expect. I'll often finish up (pun intended) with a dude and instantly want NOTHING to do with him sexually ever again. I've 'slept' with 2 guys (in quotes because one time was a disaster). I tried top &amp; bottom and genuinely did not enjoy either. The thought of bottoming is great in my head, but not at all fun when it's actually happening. Additionally anal grosses me out a lot (both men and women), and the fantasy of sucking dick is way better than the actual act of doing so.

I'm really down to earth and in touch with myself, but the one time these feelings really fuck with me is when I become really attracted to a male friend. For example my current supervisor for the summer is really hot. We get along great. He has a girlfriend, and I would never do anything to compromise their relationship or our professional relationship. But DAMN is he hot (it's one of those- even when he smells bad he smells really good... btw we do a lot of outdoor work). But my attraction gets to the point where in my head I turn into a psycho jealous girlfriend- I don't like it when he hangs out with other people because I want to be his 'best' friend or 'favorite' or some shit. I realize how irrational these feelings are and I would never act on them. I just wish they would go away! I just wish I was 100% attracted to women. 

Since I'm not 'out' I don't talk about these feelings. I've admired the strength of people who have posted on here and thought I'd give it a shot. Happy to answer any questions since I'm not sure if I explained myself very clearly. Any advice or feedback?

I don't want to go into too many details because enough people in my life know bits and pieces about my situation and I would like to remain anonymous.  Also, in the same vein, I will apologize up front for the throwaway account. So you can visualize, I am a mid-20's white male.

Growing up I was not very sexual. I don't think it was because I wasn't interested but I was just so busy with everything going on in my life that the free time usually required for a kid to get away and get his rocks off was not there for me.  I had to have a job from the age of 13, including when I was in school, and on top of that I was an active athlete, a useful tool for avoiding the trappings of growing up in an urban neighborhood many people are scared to visit.  I didn't have many friends outside of my athletics and of the few friends I had that were girls I knew them so long that I couldn't imagine putting their friendship at risk by entering into a BF/GF relationship with them.  Ok, maybe I did imagine and did think about it a lot, but I never acted on it.

I had saved up enough money on the side after working and helping the family to travel, something that has always been a dream/passion of mine, so the fall after graduating HS I decided to defer college for a year and travel through Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.  I left home in August.  In October I was walking through a club district late at night and was attacked from behind by a man with a knife.  He pulled me into a nearby ally behind a dumpster before I could react. I sort of panicked and before I could get out my wallet my pants were down.  The rest is a blur and makes me nauseas to think about but I ended up on the ground, pants down to my knees, and some blood coming out of my extremely sore anus.  Strangely he left my phone and wallet in my pocket and never said a word to me.  Not sure what to do I called the embassy who told me to go to a hospital and there I was met by police and a representative from the embassy who was there to make sure I didn't say the wrong thing because sodomy is illegal where I was.  

I didn't leave my room for two weeks except to eat.  After the first day I didn't even shower.  I was a fucking mess in a random country with no real friends or family to help out.  My mother wanted me to come home but I wouldn't budge.  I was renting a room from some local students who did not know what was going on, only that I was very disturbed and that I was not the person they had met when I first met them.  Finally one of them convinced me to leave the apartment and go out with them, there was a small dinner party they were attending and they wanted me to come.  I begrudgingly went (I took a shower and such first) and I was feeling a little better.  There was only one other American at the party, a girl my age who was volunteering as an English teacher at a school for abandoned teens.  For some reason these kids weren't in an orphanage, they kept their own residence and some even had younger siblings to look after, so we had some interesting conversation.  Sorry for the tangent.  Anyways, being my first time eating a real meal in a long time, I started feeling very good about myself, and ended up talking confidently with this girl all night.  She ended up staying in my room that night but nothing happened other than us falling asleep spooning.

The next morning reality hit me. She was a nice girl and all but I didn't want to drag anyone into my shit storm life.  At this point I had cancelled the rest of my trip and decided to stay in the country until I was no longer needed by the police and then bolt.  In a rare state of openness I told her everything that had happened that morning.  She was obviously horrified and when I told her that I didn't want her to be dragged down by me she wouldn't have any of it.  Looking back it was obviously very selfish of me to even mention it to her and give her that burden to hold on her shoulders.  We started seeing each other daily and she even accompanied me to all of my followup doctor visits (std checks, etc) and meetings with the police/prosecutors.  We spent a lot of time together and when my sublease was up I ended up moving into her apartment. I told myself I was staying in order to see the prosecution against my attacker take place and assist as a witness but I know it was also because I had taken a real liking to her. The night I moved in I lost my virginity, well lost my consensual and m/f virginity.  we lived there (on her dime) through the winter and spring and had a great time.  We cried together a lot (she had just lost her dad) and laughed a lot.  Oh, and we had sex. A lot.  A normal day had us having sex at least 3 times a day.  We used a condom for the first month but once I got negative results from all of the STD tests we stopped using protection as she was on the pill.

After her stint as a teacher was up it was time for us both to fly back to our respective homes, me to college for the summer semester and her back to her mom's.  We were over 1,500 miles away so we had to make a decision.  We went from sex all the time to none at all. I don't know what she did but I was masturbating a lot.  She gave me enough... material to keep me busy between visits but it wasn't enough.  After the summer semester was over I left the dorms even though they were covered by my scholarship and moved in with her, again on her (or her family's) dime.  She wasn't going to school but her mom just wanted her to be happy I guess.  We lived basically as a married couple through my time in college and got married as soon as I graduated.  That was two years ago and now my wife is pregnant with our first child.

After all that, finally here is my confession.  After a while things slowed down sexually to a more normal rate.  The problem is that I was a little obsessed.  I would have to have an orgasm at least once a day so if she wasn't game I would just masturbate. She doesn't really care when I do but I am concerned over what I am masturbating to.  I am obsessed with middle school and high school love stories that end in one or both losing their virginity.  Sure I can get off to run of the mill porn but I am constantly attracted to young love stories.  I have never watched underage porn but I have visualized it in my head and have even fantasized about a 15 year old me having sex and taking the virginity of my wife's 15 year old sister.  I have even gotten off to brother/sister 'exploration' stories.  I don't think I am attracted to children but I am attracted to the experience of learning about sex in the teenage years. I guess that is the best way to put it.  I am still very attracted to my wife and she does not have the features of a teenager.  I worry that I will have bad thoughts about my child when he/she is a teenager.  I worry that I will make my wife feel bad because she is unable to satisfy me sexually.  Even before she got pregnant we were only having sex once a week max, now it is even less frequent.  I still love her with all my heart and don't want to do anything to hurt her.

A big part of me wants to just disappear.  Not die but to just go away.  I often think about leaving everyone in my life behind so that I don't have anyone to drag down.

Oh, and for those who are wondering, yes my rapist was convicted and sentenced to 10 years which was actually extended to 20 due to something he did while in prison.

I am sure there are things here that don't make sense or are missing, I just put down things as they came to me and deleted and started over many times and might have left something out, so feel free to ask.

I need to let it out somewhere because it's been haunting me these past few days. I honestly can't believe it was me who did this, I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing now. 

So way back when I was a horny teenager my MALE 9 year old cousin (second cousin, let's call him Ed) came over while I was having a shower. He knocked on the door and asked if he could play on my Playstation, I said sure. When I was done showering for some reason I had the hardest erection so it was a difficult for me to put on my towel because it was hurting my boner. 

I needed to go into my bedroom to get dressed and Ed was playing in there. As I walked in, he looked at me and was like ""Woah it's so big!"". I was flattered and asked him if he wanted to see it because he kept staring and plus the towel was uncomfortable. He nodded, I dropped the towel and he just sat there open mouthed. I remember my heart beating really fast examining the pros and cons of what started going through my mind. I wasn't gay but at that moment it didn't matter.

I can't remember moment to moment details thank god not that you'd want to know. But a few minutes later we were dry humping except I was naked and he was clothed. Then I started cumming and he asked ""What's that?"" and I was like ""Oh shit!"" as my senses started coming back to me I grabbed my clothes ran into my parent's bedroom and hid under the bed in shame. Soon he started looking for me and calling my name but I just stayed there in silence until they went home. 

Our family moved out of the country months later and we lost contact so I never saw him again until just recently on Facebook. If we met I don't think I could ever look him in the eye even though it happened all those years ago, and he might not even remember.

** --- THE STORY --- **

(If you just want to read the confession, just scroll down.)

For the past five years, I've had a fucking horrible time trying to become independent. I graduated from an university, started working at a job I absolutely loved, was making good money and I was so happy - I was done with school, I had the car I wanted for a long time, I was seeing friends all the time, volunteered my time at an equine ranch helping to bring sick horses back to health so they could be used to rehabilitate disabled children. I had a plan, my life was stable and I was well on my way to being self-sufficient in my mid-twenties.

Two months after I got the job, we got a notice from corporate that the company was going out of business and we would all get laid off in a few months. After all was said and done, my life changed. I had no income. I had to stop volunteering at the ranch because I simply didn't have the money for gas. For over a year, I didn't have a job. I ended up getting a part-time job at a pet store cleaning ferret shit for $7 an hour. They cut my hours down from 24 a week to just three without an explanation. When I asked, the manager snapped at me and told me to leave her alone. I quit on the spot.

I've been looking for an IT job everywhere in the United States, even moved to Boston for a month. Everywhere I go, it's all the same: ""We can't hire you because you're deaf."" Everywhere. I'm not kidding. I got blackballed from a local university after my friend (who works for the same university) overheard the hiring manager having a meeting with HR about how to disqualify me from a position I applied for. Ever since then, every time I try to apply for a position at that university, my resume gets thrown into a black hole, never to be seen again. By the time I figured out what was going on, it was too late for me to do anything about it legally.

Finally, in April of 2009 I landed a GREAT job at a local computer repair place. It was only five minutes away from where I lived, pay was great, I enjoyed the work. Three months after I started, I was ""let go"" for three months. I was told that business had slumped and they didn't have the money to pay me. Found out they hired somebody while I was gone. A full time coworker left and I tried to get his position so I could become full time. I was told this all the time: ""You can't do it because you can't hear people come in or answer the phones."" I got the government involved and they provided equipment to enable me to do my job. My boss never let me used them. He kept pulling people in from the outside to fill in the position, one after another while I was stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. Eventually he stopped scheduling me. When I called him to ask about it, he said he just wouldn't schedule me anymore because I ""can't answer the phones or talk with customers."" - which is what I have done, and I had no problems, thankyouverymuch! Oh, and I forgot to mention that the company has less than 15 employees, therefore they are exempt from discrimination laws? Yeah... I've had a paralegal, two lawyers and the EEOC investigate my case and they just won't even touch it with a ten foot pole.

** --- THE CONFESSION --- **

So now, I'm living in my friend's house and paying rent, but pretty soon the reserve cash from my unemployment benefits will run out. I've been collecting disability from the government and that's not enough to cover everything. I'm still looking for jobs not just here, but in New York City, Boston, etc. I might have enough money to last me until August, but afterwards, there are going to be major changes.

You see, when a friend of mine moves in and takes over the room, I'm planning on just getting the fuck out of here. Just leave most of my things behind, get in my car and just drive. I'm going to live entirely out of my car with only my phone, laptop, clothes and passport. I'm going to drive around the US and Canada. I'm going to look for jobs while living out of my car. I'm going to see some friends, make new ones and have a huge fuckin' adventure. I'm going to visit as many states and provinces as possible. I'm not even going to tell my family until I'm on the road. I just want to be by myself, not having to rely on anyone for anything. And you know what? It will be fucking glorious.

Yeah, I've probably lost my mind, but all I can see ahead of me is darkness and I'm just slipping deeper and deeper into depression. So, you know what, fuck everything. Fuck people.

Carefully remembering where to put things back, I would go through all of her things.  And I mean all.  Not just her clothes, but in her bedroom I found her vibrator.  I'll give an example of how low I sunk:

I put on her lipstick, imagining some of her spit touching my lips.  Then on a bed I arranged a leather jacket of hers, panties from the wash basket, a pair of her boots and a cotton shirt.  These were so arranged that I could lie down and lick the boots and jacket, and sniff the panties with my cock burried in her shirt.

To complete the scene, I inserted her vibrator in my arse and turned it full on.  The sensations I got from molesting her clothes, smelling her scent, rubbing the lipstick between my lips, and having her vibrator buzzing inside me, were ecstatic.  I thought of her as I came into her shirt.

With diligent cleaning up, she never new.

Hate myself for being a freak. ,141,31,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18y81m/attracted_to_my_twin_brother_hate_myself_for/,"This is going to be long winded and I'm bad at writing so sorry in advance, but I just need to put it down somewhere.

It all started last summer, when we were at a Mexican restaurant, it was me, my brother, and two of our friends who were dating at the time. The waiter bought us both complimentary sundaes to share, with these love heart designs in them in strawberry sauce. My brother  was like, err we're not dating, were brother and sister, even though to me, it hadn't even occurred to me that the waiter had assumed we were dating, but then he was like oh god and started laughing, then we all just found it funny, however, it was the start of some in joke that went way out of hand. 

The guy we went with is known for being pervy, and having ""edgy"" humour, its hard to really explain better than that, he started kidding around  a LOT about us dating, and at first I was cool with it and played along bla bla, acting grossed out (really I was just humouring him and annoyed), he started telling strangers we were dating all the time for the reactions etc. Eventually his at the time gf told him that I thought it was getting really old and he stopped it, until this end of the summer party. 

It was only the second time I'd been drunk properly, and I don't remember most of the party, it was loud and there were many people there, I just have fast vague memories of going from person to person rambling about bs and pretending I wanted to be there (I DO like parties, just.. this was too big), but this part of the night is clear in my mind, when that edgy guy gathered everyone around to play dares. Long story short, the bottle landed on me and my brother, if the edgy guy had spun the bottle I'd had refused flat out, but it was some girl not even from our school who didn't know about the whole in-joke of us dating. She dared us to kiss, and I was like no, thats my brother, she was like ""yeah I know!"" then the jokes started and the jeering blah blah, drunkedgyguy LOVED it, and started a chant to get us to kiss, my brother even looked like he wanted to out of peer pressure, I felt like it was completely perverse people were trying to get us to do that, and at the risk of looking all serious and a downer or whatever I just refused, got a bit upset and left the room, edgyguys gf got really mad at him (she was one of my best friends at the time, we've kinda drifted since the summer though.. not even sure why in retrospect, not that its relevant..), luckily people seemed on my side though once I got all serious, but... I couldn't help but think about how it seemed like my brother was up for it. -_- 

I started having dreams about him around this time, sexual ones, I got curious about them, read up on incest, discovered reddit this way... and /r/incest, and in a matter of weeks developed this completely perverse fetish out of nowhere. I started thinking about things me and him had done when we were really little, we had this game called ""the naked game"", it was a completely fucking dumb roleplaying game, where one of us would roleplay a member of the public, and the other would roleplay someone who was... naked in public (i dont even know where the fuck the idea for this game came from...), but we'd take it in turns, one being naked, one being the discoverer of the naked person, in the garden or in our bedrooms. Another game we used to play was that we were trapped in a cave (under the bed), and, for this, we also had to be naked. We never touched each other with our hands, but we hugged each other, lay on each other... it was sexual. I started to get off on the memories of those games we hadn't played since we lived at my old house, so like 8 years old or whatever. 

I realise the attraction has become really bad since the summer, I only get chance to be alone with him properly during school holidays like half term, christmas, etc, last october i had no courage during that half term, over winter i was alone with him every now and then, i tried flirting, joking, i cuddled with him in his bed whilst we watched tv, ive let him see me in my underwear, far more than could be considered normal or appropriate, and last night over facebook, i completely fucking overstepped the mark by asking him hypothetical questions, such as, ""if i wasnt your sister would you be attracted to me?"", and ""if i was attracted to you what would you do?"" - ive asked him these sorts of questions before, REALLY vaguely, ive de-censortised incest jokes, and made them with increasing frequency, sometimes he jokes back, soemtimes he doesnt joke back and seems cold about it (i almost think his willingness to return jokes is based on how horny he is at that very moment), but last night when i asked him these hypotheticals, i don't think he was horny at all, as he replied ""well, I wouldn't be upset if you were attracted to me as long as you didnt try anything"", and ""i can't imagine you as anything but my sister so i dunno the answer lol!"", effectively. 

today hes been odd with me, part of me hopes its just because he got a new video game this morning, but another thinks its cus ive given too much away and that now he thinks the kidding around and the flirting aren't just kidding around, and that hes realised the truth, that im attracted to him, and ive become obsessed with the idea of being with him...im terrified if hes realised the truth, not because i think he'll tell someone about it, but because he'll start treating me differently, and most importantly, wont reciprocate.

I know I was just a kid, but that's how I feel deep down inside. He was laying on the floor of our kitchen, we were having dinner then. He fell off the chair in a way that makes me jump up with an adrenaline rush everytime I hear a chair breaking. It traumatized me, I suppose.

To this day, I regret not having the presence of mind to swallow my tears. I should have at least waited for him to loose consciousness completely, untill I unleashed the horror that was inside me. I did not meant for his last memory to be that of his grandson screaming in despair.

I remember he still managed to pull himself together with all his strenght, in order to try and drink the water I was giving him. He focused his eyes, raised his neck from the floor, looked straight at me and said: ""*calm down, I'm just coughing*"". After that, his head fell back on my arm, his eyes rolled over and he finally lost consciousness. Doctors said he had an atrial fibrilation, which is usually associated with a flutter or cough sensation in the chest area. Those were his last words.

Also, sorry about the short paragraphs, it's just how I think/write.

About six months ago, I began engaging in an activity which could be classified as a borderline eating disorder. I cannot allow myself admit to what it was specifically, even in writing.

Five days ago, I stopped engaging in the activity, because my father found out and confronted me about it. In the lengthy (but love filled) discussion that ensued, he made me agree to see a therapist, just once. 

I was, and still am opposed to this, but he wanted me to do it if not for me, then for him and my mother. I made him agree that it would not be an eating disorder specialist. I never allowed myself to say the words eating disorder in front of him. 

I told him the behavior would stop immediately, and that I could fix this myself. I was partially right. The behavior has stopped, but I still think about doing. Admittedly, I've thought about it less and less as the days have gone on, but still, I don't know if I can say I fixed myself yet.

I know exactly why I wont admit to having a borderline eating disorder without being able to do so anonymously. Because in my head, eating disorders are for depressed girls and little bitches, and god fucking dammit I'm a manly man. Believe me, I know how awful that sounds, and in everyday life I'm one of the most progressive, open minded, liberal people you'll come across, so I hate myself for thinking that way.

1367859743.0,109,self.confession,1dsvit,"I'm (20F) currently dating the man (42M) who ""molested"" me when I was much younger. AMA",165,56,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dsvit/im_20f_currently_dating_the_man_42m_who_molested/,"I say ""molested"" in quotes because while I'm sure that's what most people would call it that I didn't feel taken advantage of or harmed at all when our first relationship began. That later changed and I have hated him for years. Now we're dating again and all my friends know about it is that I'm dating a much older man. Let me try to explain.

When I was eleven years old my best friend's parents were divorced. She spent every other weekend at her dad's house and sometimes I spent the weekend there with her. His place was outside of the city, a small horse farm with riding horses, goats, a five minute walk from a lake, really nice place. So much different than the city.

Mr. Dean was really cool too. He would bring us out for ice cream, let us just wander his property without constantly checking up on us, that sort of thing. He treated us like mature adults not little kids and I loved that. I even told him that once one night after my friend had fallen asleep. That's when he gave me his YIM ID and said that if I ever needed to talk to an adult about something I didn't want my parents to know about, he'd be there for me.

So we became YIM buddies. I kept this secret from everyone, including my friend, because like Mr. Dean said his daughter might think he's using me to spy on her (he did ask about her a lot: how was her home life, was she happy in school, things like that). As for my parents he pointed out that they wouldn't understand how a girl my age and a man his age could be friends. That much was definitely true, my parents were very over-protective. So he was my secret friend and I thought it was really cool to have a grown man as a friend, especially one who was always complimenting me so much and telling me how special I was. It wasn't long before I developed a crush on him.

It took me awhile to realize he was flirting with me. Thinking back about it I now realize he had been flirting from the start but at eleven years of age I had little self confidence, especially with older boys and men, and just couldn't believe a guy like Mr. Dean would be physically attracted to me. That changed when he found out from his daughter that we had taken my parents new digital camera out for a school project, probably hinting she wanted one for herself (she was always trying to get him to buy her things). When he asked me about it online I said that yes, my parents had a new digital camera and it was awesome. That's when he asked me to take some ""special pictures"" of myself for him.

He didn't ask for nudes at first, only pix of me in my underwear. I remember being so embarrassed when he asked for that. But he explained it would make him feel special to know that I trusted him enough with such pictures especially if I was taking them only for him. So one day I relented and took about a dozen pictures of me in my nicest undies, all while making ridiculously silly poses due to my embarrassment, and sent them to his e-mail account.

After that things began to escalate really fast. He sent me a picture of his penis with the title ""Look what your pictures did to me!"". He then asked me for nudes and by now I was feeling older and sophisticated so I complied. He started asking me if I ever touched myself (I did) and then if I ever thought of him while I touched myself (I did). That led us to full on Internet sex. He then started providing me with passwords to (legal) porn websites, asking me to watch various videos and then chat about them. 

Basically within two months of beginning our online friendship he was turning me into his personal little pervert girl. And I was happy to be that for him, I wanted to make him happy. Whenever I disappointed him he would disappear for a few days and when he came back I would be so relieved that I would do anything I could to make sure he didn't do that again. He was manipulating me like a master psychologist or something which isn't much of a stretch: I eventually learned that he went to grad school for a masters in social work and then interned for awhile as a adolescent psychologist. He never finished the internship because his stay at home business really took off and he ended up focusing on that exclusively. But still he had the skills. He knew how to turn a bratty tirade of mine into the exactly conversation he wanted within minutes. He especially knew how to use my insecurities and desire to please him to his advantage.

That's what led to our first real sexual encounter. I was almost twelve now and he said that it was time for us to spend some real time together. He came up with the whole plan and then one day after school I met him at a nearby gas station and he brought me back to his farm for the night. My parents thought I was at a sleepover at another friend's house. He had a cell phone that he'd given me the number for to give for them. When they called later that evening, which of course they did, he answered and pretended to be my mystery friend's father. We ended up using the fake friend throughout the course of our relationship with my parents never figuring out that she didn't exist.

He started things off with me slow, very slow. I'd never even kissed a boy before and he knew that. He also knew how extremely nervous I was. That first time we basically just made out but we did both spend pretty much all of that night naked. He fingered me to what I mistakenly thought was an orgasm and then he showed me how to reciprocate by jacking him off. 

After that night we started seeing each other a lot more often. I lost my virginity to him shortly after my 12th birthday. We ended up ""dating"" like that for about two years. During that time he really messed with my head as much as he did with my body. He explained that promiscuity was a natural thing and that I shouldn't turn into people like my parents who saw sex as this dirty, evil thing. He actualy encouraged me to be with other boys and that's what I did in my stupid attempt to please him. I got pregnant when I was thirteen, most likely from a boy from my neighborhood. After the abortion my parents cracked down on me even more than ever so it was awhile before I could see Mr. Dean again. But we saw each other most nights, online, sharing pictures of each other and talking about the most perverted things imaginable. He once convinced me to try and seduce my older brother which led to his disgust and horror and a threat to tell our parents. When I tried again due to Mr. Dean's insistence he followed through on his threat and my parents put me into therapy. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Mr. Dean.

Up until two months ago I've hated him for what he did to me. He definitely abused me, both physically and mentally. He made me love him but convinced me through subtle means that I wasn't really worthy of love myself. He exposed me to things no child should be exposed to and gave me a warped view of sexuality and relationships. 

And despite all that I am now dating him. For the last two months since randomly running into me at work we have been dating openly. He hasn't changed much either and I hate myself for being too weak to do the right thing and cut him off. But there's this part of me I can't explain that enjoys reliving the past. After a wild spree after the last time I saw Mr. Dean back when I was fourteen I had only been with two men in five years, both serious relationships. Sure I've been a bit of a party girl at times but I haven't been a slut, not until I started seeing Mr. Dean again two months ago. Now he's involved me in three three ways, all with different male friends of his, and one semi-gangbang.

None of my friends know about any of my recent behavior or the past Mr. Dean and I share. Outwardly he comes across as a normal, educated, very intelligent and polite man. Some of my friends initially questioned why I'd date someone old enough to be my father but all of them have come to accept him. Some are even jealous because he's extremely handsome and obviously very well off financially. He showers me with gifts and will be taking me to Puerto Rico next month for an entire week and he's paying for everything. All of my friends think he's a romantic and I let them believe that. But none of them know the truth of our past or what he is currently trying to return me to in the present: he wants me to be his doting little pervert girl again and he has been succeeding. Worst part is that I don't know if I want him to fail. Just the thought of him getting bored with me or something makes me upset.

* I don't work. 
* I don't go to school.
* I hardly ever interact with people. I'm not agoraphobic but I'm really socially phobic. I've never had a job. After languishing in community college (failed out of university) I finally threw in the towel a few years ago. I can sit in classes and I can pass em and rack up units, but I could have a fucking PhD and no one would hire me because my social skills are shit.
* I'm not even learning anything online (I swear I'm about to start that at least)
* I don't read as many books as I used to
* I don't watch TV or movies or anything. My attention span has dwindled drastically

Reddit *is* a big deal for me, even though it kills me to admit it. I've been using forums on the internet for about 10 years (I started when I was a teenager). And in the beginning, I was paralyzed with fear of saying the wrong thing. I couldn't really relate to people and it took me a long time to start writing things regularly, and even LONGER to not feel mortified and regretful of almost everything that I said. I've never understood people who say they are shy in real life, but hopped on the internet and poured their heart out like it was no big deal, or said any outrageous damn thing.

By the time I hit reddit...I was ripe for being consumed by it. I liked that it didn't even have profile pics. I was freed from having a reputation. I was seasoned by so many years of watching other people on the net say the dumbest shit, that I no longer became scared to say my own dumb shit. That, and because the userbase was so incredibly huger than any other site's I've encountered, inevitably no matter what I said, someone would answer me and talk to me and more often than not would be able to relate to me.

You know, I was about to say this makes me feel like how I felt when I got ""addicted"" to Stephen King novels. I never wanted to be so *pedestrian* but I guiltily read one after the other, every single damn talking car novel...I didn't want to be the kind of person who likes reddit, but goddammit this is a force in my life that has not usually been equaled.

Which isn't to say this is *only* a problem because it makes me so damn uncool. No no, that's not what I'm getting at at all. I've grown up to be horribly disconnected from humanity and unable to earn money and now am super unemployable...That's kind of the big deal here.

Anyone else read ""Hearts in Atlantis?"" Even though I feel totally freakish...I relate to the situation described in the story.

I work at a restaurant as a waitress.  When I got hired, my boss (the head chef) and I really hit it off as friends.  We always joked around and he made it very known that I was his favorite employee.  I loved it. We flirted a bit, but it was nothing inappropriate or abnormal.  

I ran into him one night at a bar, where he introduced me to his girlfriend, who he never mentioned existed.  She lived about an hour away and wasn't always around.   I was really surprised at how saddened and disappointed I was when I found out he wasn't single.  Now that I knew I couldn't have him, I REALLY wanted him. Stupid. 

fast forward a couple months-- we were having our work christmas party.  When he walked in everyone jumped up and hugged and congratulated him-- apparently he had proposed to his girlfriend, and told everyone except for me-- his ""favorite employee"".  

 Later in the evening, several drinks later, I admitted to him I was a little disappointed he didn't tell me.  We ended up having a very long conversation in which he told me that if circumstances were different, he'd want to be with me.  We kissed. briefly. 

A couple months after this, he and I were closing the restaurant after everyone else had gone home. When we were done we sat at the bar and had a few drinks, like we always do, and were just talking and joking around. He started getting really flirtatious and I was flirting back. Long story short-- he really aggressively picked me up and threw  me on the bar and we had some incredibly amazing sex right there.  It was a pretty dumb thing to do, but at the time it was really sexy and exciting and extremely hard to say no to.  

After this I started sleeping with him ever week or two. It was kind of fun and exhilarating to have a secret relationship. (not to mention the fact that he REALLY knows what hes doing in bed) But at the same time, it made me feel like crap.

I finally ended it last night, telling him he needs to either brake up with his fiancee or we need to stop. I was starting to have some really strong feelings for him and it just wasn't fair.  He told me if that was the case, we had to stop sleeping together.  

Im feeling really horrible about the whole thing.  Not only because of what I'm doing to his fiancee (which is terrible)  But, selfishly, I feel completely rejected and used by this guy I REALLY like.  I cannot believe how stupid I am.

**MAJOR** depression my entire life.  On a scale of 1 to 10 probably somewhere in the 40s.  Therapy didn't help, meds didn't help and when the benefits of a former life ended I didn't see any reason to fight for something that wasn't doing any good and uncomfortable anyway.  Not a day has gone by since I was around 12 that I haven't wished for an exit - or that I had never existed to begin with.  I'm not suicidal though.  I could never harm myself and I have a serious awareness of how that would affect others and I couldn't do that.  I couldn't let others know how I felt, I couldn't let somebody else be grossed out by finding my body so I just suffer in silence.

There are people who will miss me.  A lot.  But they don't really appreciate that I'm here - one of those don't know what you have until its gone things.  I really, REALLY feel bad for them but I need to care about what I need and want more than somebody else for once.

I've done a lot of community work, usually until a program ends and I'm told that I am no longer wanted.  I used to volunteer more but never really felt appreciated for what I offered so when I had to put in significant efforts to find somebody willing to give me something to do I just gave up trying.  Nobody noticed.  Or cared.

Over the past years I have become aware of an increasing pressure inside my head.  It isn't a headache, it feels like a balloon is squishing things as it inflates.  No other symptoms that I've noticed but it is getting more persistent and stronger as time goes on.  I'm thinking tumor, aneurism or abscess.  Something expensive though, and even if I had a way to pay for it I'm afraid that if I ever took time off for me - to recover - I wouldn't have a job waiting for me (not that I could afford that much time off work anyway) and at my age the chances of finding a new job are none to ""you're stupid to even ask"".  I have a lot to offer, mad talents and skills and a work ethic like you wouldn't believe but zero aptitude for marketing myself and at this point I don't even care anymore.

I don't know if that's what's causing this funk that surrounds me.,142,37,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ilot6/i_fucked_my_new_roommate_i_dont_know_if_thats/,"I recently moved out of my parents house into a large townhouse with other college-aged students like myself. It's been a rather typical experience, some of the people here are annoying or particular or whatever shit, but for the most part the house has ran as well as can be expected when 6 very different people live together.

Out of all my roommates, N has been the one I connected with the most. I've gone through some bullshit in life, and I like people who are real, who don't enjoy drama or head-games, but just want to live life. N is just one of those guys who is just different, and I liked that about him. We're also both artists, which was a real bonding thing, I think. He understood my art, and that meant a lot to me.

There was always this underlying sexual tension I think we both tried to ignore. I knew I shouldn't pursue it. Roommate fucking leads to roommate drama. But I got drunk one night and texted him inviting him up into my room.

He didn't respond until the next day, and his response was fucking crazy. He said he'd been really tempted to join me, but he'd recently had a gay experiment (Which floored me) and that while he still considered himself straight he figured we should talk about it first, in person.

We're both shy, and we never really talked about it, just acted like everything was normal. Maybe a week or two went by, and then I texted him again, asking him to come up and spend the night with me. But this time, he actually did. 

I led him to my bed, and within a minute we were making out. He fingered me, I sucked him, and it felt fucking awesome. He's 5 years older than me, and it really shows. He's the most sexually confident partner I've ever had, and certainly the biggest. He even put a condom on, but got whiskey dick and we called it a night.

The next day we started making out again, but he stopped us, saying he wasn't comfortable. I was super embarrassed, but we ended up laying in bed for an hour, talking about our sexual pasts and various experiences. He told me about his sexual history, even explaining his gay experiment. I told him about the sexual abuse in my past. I rarely talk about it, but I'm glad I did.

One night not too long after he told me he wanted to ""return the favor"" and go down on me. He was so fucking good at it. He knew exactly what would drive me crazy. It was really hot.

Then, a week ago, we both got drunk. We fucked in his bed. 

The next day, I'm in such bad pain I have to go to the ER. Turns out I have an ovarian cyst that was bleeding. The doctors held me overnight  and considered surgery, but eventually released me.

I told him it had nothing to do with us, but I honestly think he fucked me so deeply that my cyst started to bleed. I'm not mad at him or anything like that, I just think that's what happened.

I gave him head a couple days later, and since that we've had no physical contact. We still act like best friends. We always have. We hang out and draw nearly every day. 

I'm not sure how to feel about everything. I've been stressed out with money and rent (both hospital bills and a broken car) but even now that those are addressed, I still feel such anxiety. True, I'm still trying to get better physically, but my nerves are shot. My appetite is severely reduced, I feel short of breath, and I can feel how tense my body is right now.

I told her yesterday that I wanted to be with her again and she hasn't talked to me all day. I want to facebook stalk her but I deleted my facebook in the divorce, I want to pepper her with texts until I get a responce but I don't want to be creepy.

There are so many things wring with me. I bought her a fucking car, we were getting divorced, and she goes out and buys a car down payment on heer credit cards. Guess who foots the bill.

We weren't read for marriage, I wish we were. I want to take a break and be friends for a year or twop and get back together after we grow up a bit.

My husband is the stay-at-home parent and I work 40+ hours a week. My son has disabilities that make him a handful, essentially resulting him running around and yelling all day long. He has no idea of volume control and I am worried he will get us thrown out for excessive noise (not all family noise is protected by law and my kid is loud). He doesn't speak real well and he didn't even lol at us for the first couple years of his life.

Anyway, my husband is on the verge of a breakdown from his mental illness and the stress. I am pregnant and too tired to deal with everything along with going to my job. I spend my days off watching my son and taking him to all of his appointments. 

I just wish there was a place we could put him for a week so we could recover. I know we won't hurt him, but we yell more than we would like and I find myself thumping him lightly to get his attention because he just won't listen to us. I really hate being a parent and I was hoping this next kid would make it better, but the stress seems to make everything worse for now.

We will definitely look into getting a break, and we have been pounding proteins into him, which seems to help him somewhat.

I've wanted to share this story before but all relevant threads usually have thousands of comments before I get to them so I never have.

This is really hard to type because I have literally never told anyone about it before. Okay here goes.

Oh, some background: I'm 31, female, and this all took place about five years ago.

I work as a CPA for a small technology company. I got the job right out of college because one of my best friends from college had married the company's owner and convinced me to give their startup a shot. When I started there were only five of us but we've got over thirty employees now so it's been pretty successful. It's a great job, I am compensated well, and almost everybody I work with is awesome.

About a year after starting the job we landed three big accounts that really saved us. In order to celebrate the owner, Dave (not his real name), threw a party at his house. Dave is 41 now so he was about 36 back then. The party consisted mainly of drinking while playing boardgames and just relaxing and enjoying the fact that we knew we all had jobs for the foreseeable future now.

Maggie (my friend, Dave's wife) turned in relatively early. Even though I hadn't had too much to drink I decided to stick around for awhile and have coffee to sober up. Dave isn't only my boss, he was my friend (I was in their wedding) so I felt completely safe sticking around alone with him after everybody else left. 

Dave was pretty drunk and doing what drunk men do. He was flirting heavily with me. I wasn't worried at all because I knew how much the company's success meant to him and even figured he deserved to celebrate. But when I told him I was leaving he ""jokingly"" told me he wasn't letting me leave because I was too drunk to drive (I definitely wasn't). 

He sat down next to me on the sofa and playfully gripped my wrist and said he'd force me to stay because it was for my own good. This is when I started to realize I might be in trouble. He wasn't acting like himself at all and he went from polite flirtation to making crude comments about my breasts (for example, telling me that they were the best thing about work and how I should were low-cut tops more often). 

His hand went to my thigh as he started talking about how Maggie is awful at giving head. He said that he bet I was great at giving blowjobs because of my lips and repeatedly asked me about how often I ""suck cock"". He wanted to know if I gave any of my co-workers (one in particular) blowjobs. Still trying to play this off as a joke I just laughed and said I really had to leave. 

Things took a bad turn when my cellphone rang, interrupting his drunken diatribe of perversion. When I reached for the phone he grabbed both my wrists and started pushing me down and said something, ""Let that go to voicemail, I'm your boss. This is more important.""

At this point I really knew I was in trouble. I struggled against him and for the first time started to bluntly protest his behavior. Before I'd been just casually pushing away his hand from my thigh, laughing off his perverse comments, and hoping he would just stop.

And that's the worst thing about what happened next. If I had been blunt from the beginning, if I had listened to my sub-conscious and gotten the heck out of there the moment he sat down next to me, none of this would have happened. If I wasn't so timid and afraid to stand up for myself none of this would have happened.

I'm not going into detail about the rape itself but I do want to make clear that this was not a ""date rape"" type of situation. I was so terrified that I did stand up for myself. I fought him, or tried to at least. Then I tried screaming but that only made him mad. He back handed me and that shut me up really quick. I had never been hit by anyone before and it was the shock as well as the pain that made me quiet. 

He was really rough with me so even though I tried I couldn't stay completely quiet. I kept hoping Maggie might wake up and come downstairs but she never did. As he raped me I remember just thinking, ""Please just finish, please just finish."" as I cried.

When he did finally finish all he did was get off me, zip up, and say, ""I'm going to bed. Goodnight."" Just like that, all casual. Meanwhile I was a mess, my panties were missing (I never did find them), and my dress and bra were ruined. I only vaguely remember holding my dress together as I went out to my car and drove home. I don't think I cried again until I got safely into bed.

Here's the strangest part, the part of this story that makes it so impossible to forgive myself for. I never even considered going to the police. Not even once. I can't explain the reasons why. I don't understand the reasons why. I was just numb for the next few days and the first time I saw Dave again, at work, I just went along with pretending nothing had happened.

Even worse than that is that the next time he hit on me, about a month later, we were both completely sober and I did not resist when he started kissing me in his office. I was too afraid to, I suppose, or maybe part of me just liked it. I don't know. But that began the ""mostly consensual"" part of the affair. Two or three times a week for the next six months we would hook up in one way or another. Sometimes at the office, sometimes at hotels, sometimes at my apartment.

So what do I mean by ""mostly"" consensual? Well there was always this aura of fear about it. I never once initiated anything, it was always him and he was often very rough with me. He liked calling me his ""whore"". He liked anal a lot and I think the reason is because I disliked it so much. The side I saw of him in private was the exact opposite of the kind of man I thought he was. He was cruel, he was mean, he was often angry, and he had a very very huge sense of entitlement. 

All that time I was still having lunch with Maggie most days and that hurt me as well. I was having an affair with her husband. How awful is that? She was my friend! One time I had a pregnancy scare and I've never felt so awful because Maggie had been trying to get pregnant for quite a while but it was taking longer than they'd expected (since then they've had two kids). During that scare I remember at one lunch she was talking about fertility clinics and that just really got to me.

The affair ended for reasons I don't really understand. One day after giving a blowjob he just said, ""Good work. That's the last time though, I'm done with you."" He meant it. Never once in the years that have passed has he hit on me again in the slightest. After the first month of not being with him I remember realizing that it was really over and being so relieved that I cried myself to sleep.

I'm still at the company though. Pretty much everyday I still see Dave and I see Maggie often as well (she no longer works there full time). Sometimes I wonder what kind of awful person I must be that I would react to what happened the way I did. The whole thing, from the rape to the affair, is easily my biggest secret and it weighs on me every single day.

We almost got caught a few times, but I would always just deny it and they would believe me because I was always the ""Good Quiet Girl"" 

It has negatively effected me and my well being today. I love men, and having relationships with them, but I cannot get off on sex with them. I need to watch girl on girl sex to even begin to be able to get off and masturbate. And even though I don't get off on having sex with men, I love doing it, I love faking orgasms and getting dirty and making them cum, I love it a bit too much and will have sex with anyone who wants to have sex with me. Granted I'm a very quiet and to myself person so I've only had sex with 8 guys so far. I can't associate love with anything but sex, I even have had sexual dreams about my dad, he was just showing he loved me. It's really fucked up all my serious relationships.

I've never had sex with another girl before, even though the idea turns me on tremendously, I don't want to accept this fact about myself. I don't consider myself a homophobic, but I hate the fact that I find girls so attractive and sexually appealing, it's sickening.

From so many horrible failed attempts at relationships, panic attacks from fear of her telling our family, being sexually confused, being extremely promiscuous etc; I have spiraled into a depression and regularly think about suicide. 

Anyways, I've never talked to anyone at all in the world about it, not even her. Sometimes she'll say to me ""Do you remember...."" and say something uncomfortably explicit to me, and I would just ignore her and stop the conversation. 

Feel free to ask me anything.

1347312387.0,103,self.confession,zo92d,I lied about who the father of my child was.,141,38,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/zo92d/i_lied_about_who_the_father_of_my_child_was/,"Reflecting on this is so strange because I can't make sense of my decisions. This was the worst, most deceptive thing I've ever done, and I'm so deeply ashamed of it. I know it will anger people. I deserve your anger.

I was involved in a friends-with-benefits situation with a guy, we'll call him Kyle, when I reconnected with an ex (sort of ""the one who got away"" at that point in my life), who we'll call George. I was never sleeping with them at the same time, but I ended things with Kyle only about a week before I began having sex with George again.

Kyle and I were irresponsible. He pulled out. Once, he pulled out, but in the moment, we decided to have sex again. The next day I took the emergency contraceptives.

A few weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. There was no doubt that it was Kyle's.

The only rationale I can offer for my decision was that Kyle was the ""free spirit"" type. He drank a lot, and smoked pot a lot, and wanted to travel and wander and have nothing tying him down. He was only in town for work, and before the baby would even be born, he'd be across the country.

George was a man who wanted to settle down and have kids. He wanted to be a father, and he loved me. After deciding against abortion, because I wanted a baby too badly, I told George I was pregnant. He'd never even known about Kyle's existence.

I can't figure out what I was expecting. I was aware of all the ways I could be found out. What if I have the kid, and when it's a teenager, some medical issues uncover my awful lie? It was clear: I was not just lying to the man who now wanted to marry me. I was lying to my child. I was lying to my entire family.

And what if the kid looks exactly like Kyle? He was about 6'4"" with nearly white-blonde hair and a goofy, endearing face. George had brown hair, brown eyes, studious, serious. I hoped the kid would look like me.

I pushed these thoughts out of my mind as often as I could. I guess I just convinced myself everything would be ok. I felt uncomfortable when George would talk about himself and the child. Sometimes I wanted to scream, ""It's not yours!"" I thought of a blonde-haired little baby, with a personality exactly like Kyle's. It was clear this would never last, but I didn't understand what to do, and I loved it; the baby I was going to have.

I know I fucked up, but I truly wanted the baby. I didn't get it. When I was three months pregnant, I had a painful miscarriage. I knew I deserved it. I felt sick at myself at how relieved I was. I felt such a horrible loss, and yet, I felt lightened. It was the strangest mix of emotions. I hated myself for what I had done, and I was so thankful that I'd got out of it -- of course that escape was heartbreaking. I remember sobbing and clutching a baby blankie my grandmother had gotten for the baby. The only thing that had ever touched the tiny blip of anything my baby ever was, was the inside of me. There was nothing to hold on to. The story of her that people knew wasn't even accurate: her physical existence, who she was made up of, was known only to me.

After the miscarriage, I told Kyle it was his. I told him I'd kept it from him because I knew he would want me to have an abortion, and he would resent me, and the child, for holding him back. He told me that I was right, that he would've felt that way. He was kind to me. He asked me what I wanted to name it. He hugged me, and he forgave me.

But I never told George, who is now my husband. I never will. What good would it do? Outside of my uterus, the baby never existed. It was an life that I dreamed up when I became pregnant: that I would have a child, and that it would be his. I didn't have a child, and it wasn't his. He doesn't need to know that second fact. It would break his heart. It's irrelevant to our lives now. I feel guilt over it, yes, but I'm not going to relieve my guilt at the expense of him.

I know this was a horrible thing to do. I am filled with disgust at myself. I truly don't understand it. I don't understand how I could make such terrible decisions. I just try to forget it most of the time, but it's a strange thing to carry inside of me, and it comes into my mind every once in a while.

I'd like to think what I'm doing isn't nearly as onimous as the title suggests, I really don't have any ill intentions.  This certainly isn't sexual and I don't set out with the intention of scaring anyone, though there have been a few situations where I've clearly creeped some people out.  But it's never my intention to make contact, in fact I kind of feel like I ""lost"" if people start to suspect I'm out there.

I'm a 25 yo guy.  I love camping and backpacking, I really feel more at home out in the woods which is how this started out.  That and an interest in military history and apocalyptic zombie fiction.  Yeah, I'm a dork I know.  I'd pop out to our local forest preseve - which is actually several thousand acres of upland forests - just hiking and getting my fill of the outdoors on the weekend before dredging back to the work week.  One time, I popped off the trail to just kinda stop and listen, and this couple walked by just a few feet from me and didn't even notice.  It was kind of a cool feeling.  Exhilarating.  I let them get up ahead a few hundred yards, and just spent the next few miles following to them.  Listening to their conversations, seeing how close I could get.  In plain old hiking clothes with no camo, I was able to get within about 20 feet.  Didn't do anything, didn't say anything and they never even knew I was there.  Ever since then I've been hooked.

It's turned into a sport for me and a way to get out into nature and do something other than just walk the trails.  I've bought camo outfits, I have a couple different sets to blend in with the changing seasons, which makes me feel gross to know that I've been doing it for this long.  I'm getting better and better.  Saturday I was 10 ft up a tree above a couple in their 40's while they ate lunch.  I sat motionless directly above their heads for nearly a half hour and they never saw me.

I know it sounds creepy and sick - hence the throwaway.  I'm not proud of the behavior but I do feel a sense of pride when I've gotten extremely close or followed for a very long time without being noticed.  Bottom line, I know I should stop.  I know one day I might pick the wrong person who's gonna catch on and I'll end up dead because someone flipped out on me or got scared and pulled a gun.

So that's my dark little secret.  I'll stick around to answer a couple questions if anyone has any, otherwise I'm just gonna soak up the inevitable hate and use it as a reminder to ease up on the creepy stuff.

TL:dr  I dress up in camo and follow people around in the woods for thrill.

Someone else made a joke about how she's only going to have sex with one person for the rest of her life, we laughed and joked at her, etc etc. Eventually Kelly said she didn't mind because Damon (her fiancée) was the best lover she'd ever had.

Pretty common question. And I hate hearing it because I can never tell the truth! Which is why I'm here to get it off my chest.

The hottest sex I ever had was with my first serious boyfriend, back when I was in high school, while my little brother watched.

Wow. I can't believe I actually typed that. It feels good being able to admit that to someone, even if it is only on the internet.

I'm pretty drained but here are some details: I was seventeen both time and Jake was 14/15. Both times I had sex with the same guy, David, a long term boyfriend I dated until my freshman year of college. I don't think he ever realized that Jake was watching. He definitely didn't the first time because I only realized it myself after David and I got started. The second time was planned, though, so I knew from the start that Jake was watching us.

When I say ""Average Asian""- I mean like I fit into the typical Asian stereotype.  Like I'm finishing my undergrad in engineering, I love math, I have a lot of nerdy friends, etc. 

I absolutely HATE it when I see a white guy dating an Asian girl. Not particularly because I have anything against any race or interracial dating. But just because it makes dating for Asian guys so much harder! 

If you think about it is true that a lot of Asian girls (esp those who were born/raised here) prefer white guys. It's like a ""catch"" or something to them. Like I've gone on online dating sites, and a lot of the Asian girls have written explicitly on their profile page ""DO NOT message me if you are Asian"". I'm like wtf, why not bitch? you are Asian too! 

A lot of white guys actually prefer Asian girls too. Think about like how popular Asian porn is and stuff. Like I guess it's that exotic/unique look that attracts them. However, the problem for Asian guys like me is that it doesn't work the other way around. Not that many white girls are into the Asian guys. I've seen white girls dating Asian guys, but not as many at all. 

So, its like a ""lose, lose"" situation from my perspective. They just take and take, and leave us Asian guys with nothing. 


EDIT* 

This is just my theory as to why this is the case. I think that a lot of Asian girls prefer white guys because they grew up around the western culture. When you look at the magazines, movies, tv shows, etc. the beautiful people are the blonde haired, blue eyed white muscly men or the fit, lean blonde haired women. I think that is why so many Asian girls try to look more ""white"" (dye hair, colored contacts, etc) and prefer to date white guys.

I worked 40+ hours a week, sometimes manual labor, sometimes computer stuff, while in high school and generally made double minimum wage.  I never really wanted for much since I worked so much and was paid well.

When I went to college, my cash flow dropped significantly.  During holiday breaks, I never traveled to see family for reasons I'd rather not cover.  This meant I was left alone in a college town that was nearly empty.

It started with burglarizing(robbery is when another person is involved, burglarizing is when the building is empty of people) apartments that I could walk to from my place.  Entire apartment complexes were empty because all the college kids had gone home.  Many of them simply didn't lock their doors or left windows open.  Being agile and physically fit, even second story windows were an option.

This quickly escalated to businesses.  Probably the most risky was a place where the guards carry M4's and you have to have a security badge to get on the property.  They even responded to a silent alarm that I wasn't able to disable, but my entry was well hidden, so they didn't believe anyone was in the building.  They searched for a while, then radioed to their dispatch that it was a false alarm.

I've outrun cops on foot three or four times.  I've outrun them in cars a few times.  I've had to spend hours hiding in woods waiting for them to leave before I could get out of dodge.  I know how to completely disable an alarm system in a matter of seconds, can open sliding doors with a coat hanger, jimmy doors, run police scanners, etc.  

All of this was happening during the same time that ebay was spinning up.  I was able to unload every single item I didn't keep on ebay.  If your stuff is stolen, use Google Alerts to monitor sites like craigslist and ebay.

It has been over 10 years since my last time.  I've legally made over 6 figures for 4 or 5 years now, have a family, a career, etc.  However, there's not a house or business I've visited that I haven't taken note of the security, entry and exit points, location of high value items, etc.

I regret every single thing I stole and I don't say that lightly as I regret almost nothing in my life.  I wish I could find the people I harmed and write them checks out of my savings to replace the stuff I stole.

A few words to those that want to stop people like me.  Don't buy an alarm that uses a telephone line.  Some systems use cellular service, this is what you want.  Also, make sure the alarm box/brain and siren aren't accessible by me.  Put them in a closet that locks, in the attic, etc.  Most installer put them as close to the front door as possible (usually a coat closet).  All it takes is me cutting the phone line, entering the house and ripping the siren off the wall and your alarm system is useless.

Don't leave junk sitting out when trying to sell your home.  Pretending to be a buyer, I could enter a SWAT sniper's home, locate his SWAT gear and rifles, and also schedule the owners to be out of the home for a set period of time with the alarm off.

If you have a security camera system, have it push the video to a remote location.  If it's your business, have a server in your house that your business cameras push video to.  If the video/security computer is on site, I'll be taking that with me, even if it's bolted down.

1349336547.0,105,self.confession,10xczb,"I was molested on a regular basis for all of 5th and 6th grade and now I have very disturbing sexual fantasies. (wall of text, sorry, NSFW) AMA",134,29,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/10xczb/i_was_molested_on_a_regular_basis_for_all_of_5th/,"I have never done one of these before so I don't really know where to begin.  I was molested for as the title says all of 5th and 6th grade.  It was by a neighbor kid when it started I was 11 and he was 17.  I really looked up to him and loved being around him especially since I didn't really have any friends at that time.  He started relatively slow, he took his time to groom me, making a joke here or there saying and doing various things to make me think everything was normal.  

The actual sexual abuse started with something called ""the doggy game.""  This is surprisingly hard to write.  He went through various stages with this game.  It started us both clothed but me crawling around on my hands and knees with my butt up in the air barking and panting like a dog and then he would come behind and basically try to mount me and it was my job to try to get away.  There were about 4 other stages that he took before we were both naked together but I don't really want to create a how to book with this post so I will leave that out.  But needless to say the whole time he used the pretext of the ""game"" to do all sorts of things to me.  During this whole time he had me totally convinced that everything was normal and that this is ""what adult friends do.""  

If I would ever refuse to do something that he wanted of me like wear my mother's lingerie (which I am glad to say I never did) he would totally cut me out of his life for awhile which was a big deal because I had no friends and I had no support at home (my step dad used to kidnap me to get back at my mom, and my step father bugged the house and constantly threatened to make me homeless, frame me for arrest, or would act like he would kill both me and my mom constantly).  Because of that and the fact that he was the only one I could talk to and the only one who seemed interested in helping me I was totally under his control.  

It eventually stopped because one day he wanted me to get on top of him like he would do to me and I had an erection from what he has been doing to me and when I penetrated him he freaked the fuck out and yelled at me a lot and scared me screaming that I must be some kind of fucking faggot and so on and so on.  I told him that I didn't want to play the ""doggy game"" ever again and then he really got mad and threatened to kill me and my family if I ever told and all sorts of stuff on top of how what a worthless pile of shit and how I was just a dumb fucking fag etc.  

I didn't see him for a long time after that, he wouldn't have anything to do with me.  Then all of a sudden after he got this dog (an adult boxer) he started hanging out with me more and by this time I had developed an irrational fear of dogs (which I eventually got over) and he kept trying to get me to be friends with it but I was too scared of it until right before he was going to move to a different state.  The one time I was ok with it and went up to pet it (again right before he was set to move, we had drifted a part a little bit by this time) he told me that it was too bad that it took me this long to get to where I was ok with the dog because he would have had me play the doggy game with it.  I can remember feeling cold all over and freezing and the smile on his face as he looked at me.  It was like I couldn't move and the fucked up thing is that I knew and know now that he was right he probably could have made that happen (again I was 12 at this point btw).  

The weirdest thing about all of this, I still thought it was normal.  I didn't actually know that what I had been doing with him was sex until I was 14 on a bus to a summer camp and someone made a gay sex joke, that is where I learned what gay sex was and that I had been molested (yeah I know that is stupid or ""how would I not have known"" but I don't know).  

Meanwhile after he moved at the very end of 6th grade I started going online to cybersex adults of both genders (since I am straight I preferred women but they were harder to find).  I can remember hating it with all of my being.  I can remember physically shaking and feeling cold and frozen every time I would go up to my room and wait for the computer to come on. I would have cyber sex with probably 12+ people a night and would be unable to stop until I found one that was fucked up enough.  As soon as I would cum I would instantly hate myself and wish I would die and that I could stop.  But the very next night I would be right back there, and the more stressful my life was IRL the more unspeakable things were in the virtual world.  The standard of what was enough got worse and worse with time, it also got harder and harder to find adult ""females"" so I ended up at some point going after just male pedos at around 14 and around that point switched my digital self to a girl just so there could be one in the scene.  I continued this until I was about at the end of college (I know it is fucked up and dumb or whatever, I know).  

Around that time I realized that it was killing me because it was part of this fucked up cycle I had/have.  I feel tons of stress because of school or life or insert reason, I retreat from the stress for a little bit, this increases the stress then I turn to sex to relieve some of the stress then I very quickly get very fucked up fantasies about things happening to me either online or in my own head and then I get really depressed and it ends with me seeking some help online from strangers about the abuse (which I guess what this is) while still having the fantasies as I get deeper and deeper in depression until I get almost suicidal (no where near that no worries there).  

The worst thing about it is that when I am not in that state I feel nothing about any of the abuse, I have tried therapists but I can't feel anything about any of it or even get angry at the guy who molested me for 2 years and did/made me do all sorts of fucked up shit.  I know that chat is something I have to 100% stay away from because it is an addiction and will kill me if I don't stay away.  The thing is that the fantasies havn't stopped.  

At first after stopping the chat they were gay fantasies so I thought, hey maybe I just like dick.  So I went to a gay bar to see how things went and after talking with some nice gay guys and getting hit on by a few I left without doing anything because it wasnt for me, but after that I got depressed to the point that I thought of throwing myself off of the balcony at the hotel I was staying at, so I know now its best to stay away from that.  Now the fantasies are between me and a woman but they involve me getting kidnapped and basically forced into sexual slavery and put in positions where I have no hope.  

These get me ungodly hard and work really well but there are two big down sides.  #1 If there is any weakness in the plan of the person kidnapping me or whatever it turns to how can I kill them (to escape and get away/get revenge) and can't cum (which is a really good thing, dont need that shit too) and #2 even if I can't find a weakness in their plan and I can cum I end up spending the time afterwards obsessed with how I could get away or obsessed about my own safety IRL.  I don't know, I hate myself, that is obvious especially by the things I tell myself sometimes when I masturbate during high stress situations, but I don't know what to do.  More importantly I had to tell someone, no one knows the whole story.  A couple people know I had some abuse as a kid but none of the details.  

TL:DR I have issues.

1372695007.0,102,self.confession,1hfl5g,I have no real friends. I've wasted a decade of my life.,124,22,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hfl5g/i_have_no_real_friends_ive_wasted_a_decade_of_my/,"I've never shared my feelings with anybody.  Everyone I know thinks I'm a rock.  A solid, never-depressed, all-knowing rock.  I portray this fake sense of confidence that I don't have.

A little about me:  I'm a 28/m.  Married.  Have a job I hate.  I live in an amazingly beautiful city near the beach.  

From the time I graduated highschool up until now, I've accomplished NOTHING.  I've taken some community college courses (about 2 shy of transferring to a university), have had a half dozen or so dead-end jobs.  I live in a tiny, piece of crap apartment.

My marriage is really the only thing I can be proud of.  My wife is gorgeous.  She's smart, has a lot of friends, is very active, has a great relationship with her family, and loves me to death.

I, on the other hand, am lazy, arrogant, have no contact with my family, and I take her for granted.  It sounds crazy as I type it out, and I can't believe I've let it go on so long.

I have no real friends.  In highschool, I was pretty popular, for both good and bad reasons.  I had a good amount of friends, both guys and girls, who I felt somewhat close to.  I had a few really close guy friends that I would hang out with almost everyday.

But now I don't have any close friends.  I'm a friendly guy, so when I see old friends out, we catch up and chat for a bit, but that's it.  I have no desire to hang out with them, and even 5 minutes into a conversation I want to walk away.  

I'm antisocial.  I'd rather hang out by myself than be with friends.  I'm content with sitting in my room playing video games on a Friday night.  I've just recently come to realize that I've lost a few friends because of this, but I accept it.  

I try to rationalize this by saying to myself, ""I'm at a point in my life where I don't really need any close friends.  I'm going to have kids in a year or two, and at that point I'll focus all of my love towards them and my wife.""

I feel like I'm missing out on life.  I feel like the last 10 years have been a complete waste of time.  I've accomplished nothing.  I play video games every day for hours.  I get home from work and the first thing I want to do is turn on my PS3.  I get home from work around 3PM and play video games until about 5:30, then I go to the gym, come home and make dinner with my wife.  We watch TV and then go to bed.  Same thing every day.  Work, video games, gym, dinner, tv, sleep.  The last 3 or 4 years have been like this.

Meanwhile, all of my old friends are buying houses, traveling the world and having all sorts of great experiences.  I feel like I'm watching a movie, and I'm the only one in the theater.  I feel like I'm watching my friends live the life I wish I could.

I wake up every morning and tell myself, ""Today I'm going to do something productive.""  Then I get home from work and fire up the PS3 and justify it with some ridiculous excuse. 

It's killing me.  

My wife has no idea.  I've had these feelings for so long that I feel like I can't tell anyone.  I realize this probably sounds stupid to most people, and that I should just fucking grow up and take control of my life.  I know it's true.  I just can't get myself to do it because I never follow through with anything.

I plan on joining the CHP or Border Patrol in 2014 when my wife graduates from school.  I hope at that point my life turns around.

I graduated from high school in 2007 with the intentions of attending a school in Florida for a degree in Audio Engineering. My mom, dad and brother were excited for me because it's a pretty well known school for music. As fate would have it, my father passed away a few months before I flew down.
The first month of college went perfect. The school is set up a little differently with scheduling but I basically made A's that first month. During the second month however, all the students started to get real close. During our long nights of playing old nintendo games we would do the usual college kid stuff: drink, smoke weed, bullshitting, etc. The guy's house we would go over got into selling cocaine. This is where it all started.

*The Action:*
I went to go try it with him and his girlfriend and noticed that it took away the little paranoia I had that night from smoking weed. So naturally after a dumb thought, the next day I smoked and felt paranoid simply because it was in my mind that the coke would make it feel even better. I brought a little and took some to my apartment.
Two days later my student loan arrived.... Yes..
Now, I didn't know anything about cocaine at the time. So I took $500 of that loan and brought enough coke to ""last me for at least 6 months.""

One month later I'm on the airplane back home 50lbs lighter with no recollection of anything that second month. I don't remember if I went to class, if I showered, if I slept, etc. I just have little still images in my head of random scenes.
Being that my father passed away a few months earlier I knew I couldn't tell my mom what actually happened. So what did I do?
""I think I'm having a psychotic breakdown."" A few days after, withdrawals kicked in. ""Yup, psychotic breakdown.""

I ended up going to 3 different doctors and eventually got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety and insomnia. And for said diagnostic they gave me Depakote, Trazodone &amp; Risperidone. Took those fuckers for 3 years. The more I said I didn't think I need them, the more the doctor gave me. He was an asshole about ""Problem? Higher doses.""

*The Result:*
During those three years I started to believe I had those mental illnesses because I was constantly being treated like it by my family, and they had no problem telling their coworkers. As the days went on it got harder to admit that all of the test, meds, doctors, etc. were all just to cover up my withdrawals. And basically I now have crippling anxiety because of all the stress of this lie and having to agree with all of the concerns and diagnostics. And of course with all of this: depression &amp; insomnia.

I feel like it came full circle.


**TL:DR - Did $500 of cocaine at school, came home with withdrawals. Got diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety &amp; insomnia because I didn't admit that it was because of the cocaine. Now has anxiety, depression &amp; insomnia because if it. AMA i guess**

More details included, from my memory of a time years ago.


In my case, it was my uncle back in India (I'm indian too). He was a real goodlooking guy, worked in marketing, and used to stop by a lot; He was my favorite as I was growing up. Used to tickle me a lot, and gave me so many hugs. When I was 16ish, he challenged me to a wrestling thing as usual (we called it 'kusti' &amp; did this often). He was muscular (but shorter), but let me pin him down.
There, I was , sitting on top of him triumphantly, with his face down, and his plump ass at the ""right"" position. I was in a dominant position holding his hands behind his back, and my raging harmones gave me an instant hard on. I rubbed my cock against him and he responded by lifting his arse up and grunted a little. One thing lead to another and I fucked him for all of 10 secs (came real quick). We didnt talk for a while after that (was really awkward), but resumed it when I was 18 for several years.

Loved the regular ""release"" he gave me. I loved that he moaned so well - like a lill bitch, in tandem with every thrust. HOT. I am bisexual now, and he is still one of my hottest lays. He died last year. Miss him.

I hope it's in good English I had to google some words.

Also it reads like I am spending every possible moment tied up, that’s of course not the case, some months I did it every week, some months I did it not once, just like I felt, the whole text is over a time of about 4 years.

It started years ago when I was lying in my bed and pulled my 
underpants down to my ankles and pretended somebody was forcing me to sleep that way. That started to get boring so I went on to not wearing underwear during the day sometimes as a ""punishment"", when that got boring I got myself a bikini that was a few numbers to small and felt pretty narrowing and even hurt a bit after a while, and I would wear that as underwear during the day or in bed.

Then started a time where I was alone at home every Saturday until late afternoon as my brother was at university(he’s way older) and my dad  had to work (no mom in our household), and I started to ""punish"" myself during the day with little things like I ""had to"" take an ice cold shower in my underwear and stockings and then wear cloth over it, and I tailored a ""leather underpants"" out of two belts that at first I wore because it felt so unpleasant but I started to use it to hold little objects inside my ass and vagina.

After my leatherwork was such a success I decided to make myself a gag and shackles that I used to tie myself up inside a nearly empty closet in my room.

I did ""small"" stuff like this until I turned older any my brother moved out and my dad took a new job that required him to be in another city from Monday to Wednesday, returning Thursday sometimes during afternoon.
That was when things like that got a number bigger, during the week I had never really met up with friends so after school I was my own ""fulltime slave"" whenever I felt like it. I ordered myself four handcuffs, a dog collar and a leash online and whenever I felt like it I would undress myself, put handcuffs on my hand and feet, put the dog collar on and write random insults on myself with edding, stuff like ""fat pig"", ""dairy cow"", ""hood rat/village bike...(that doesn't seem to translate all too well)"", fuck hole"" and so on (and the stuff didn't even make sense, I'm not fat nor busty and I had sex twice).
I would even sleep like that because nobody was coming home anyway. Sometimes I even slept next to the bed on the floor with the leash tied to a bed post.

Then I got the idea that on Wednesday I could cook a big meal for the next day because when our dad came home from work every Thursday my brother came by for a visit and we ate together, however that soon descended into a ""punishment game"" as I would randomly decide that I cooked to bad and that I ""had to"" clean the windows naked and in handcuffs or eat from a bowl on the floor, sleep on the balcony and so on.
Then at some point things got pretty much insane, from a mix of being bored with the same punishments all the time and not being able to dream up new ones I got the idea of hurting myself a bit, this is when I started to do a lot really weird stuff, I would hang a rope down from two roof beams like a U-shape hanging close to the floor, and ""squatted"" down on it so that it would “cut” into my vagina, I took a candle holder that was so ""artsy"" you could squeeze in a candle at any direction, so I put one in at 90° to the floor and lie under it while it burned down so that the wax dribbled down on me, I would take a triangular log of wood and kneel on that so that the edge of the wood would “cut “ into my lower leg right below my knees (I’m not as fucked up to invent stuff like that, that’s called “Scheitelknien” in German), outside in the garden I would tie the garden hose on my leg so that the nozzle pointed at my vagina and turn it on while tied up to the outdoor-shower.
But I wouldn't get enough, I remembered some retarded game where I saw the commercial years ago where you and your opponent held a kind of joystick that would give you electroshocks in turns and the point was to hold it longer in your hand than your playmate, however I decided I needed that thing between my legs so I bought one. I even went so far as to built my own ""punishment device"" that was a ventilator that I lied on its back, screw of this lattice-cover-thing, then I glued a wood rod to the fan blade and let it hit me when it spinned around.
Then someday I remembered the relatively normal days where I would just stand tied up in my closet and I felt like just standing still naked in the garden (that nobody can see into), however I wanted to add a twist, so I went outside dressed in my bathrobe but without a key so I couldn't turn back once I was outside. My plan for coming in again was that later the day I knew my brother would come to visit and then I would just put back on the bathrobe when I heard his car and wait behind the garden door until he sees me, I then just told him a story of how I was showering and thought I heard him knocking so I went down and when I looked outside the door snapped behind me, I had even let the water run to ""prove"" the story, but why would he doubt that anyway.
Anyway the point is, knowing I couldn't just stop gave me a new ""kick"" so I looked for a method to time my ""punishments"". I got myself a little box with a time lock in which I put the key for a padlock that I used instead of handcuffs together with some steel chains, quite proud of that idea I looked for cool stuff to trap me in for some time and I got the idea of hanging myself from the balcony, so I sew some kind of cushioned cloth-coating that where really thick, wrapped them around the chains so my arms wouldn't get hurt, put the time locked box with the key (In this case, for a bicycle lock) inside down beneath me, with the key hanging on a cord that was tied to my finger so I could pull it up after the box opened, stepped on a beer crate, tied my cloth-chain-shackles with the bicycle lock to the balcony rail, kicked the box away, and after a short testing phase hung there for longer than I'd like to admit.

After that I was turning down my self-""punishing"" habits for a while, when one day when I was just writing insults on myself, I wrote ""trash"" on my tummy and had the epiphany that trash does in fact belong into the trash can, so I went outside where our trash can was (one of these wheelie bins), made a hole through the cap and this edge that it sits on so that I could put my padlock through, made a few little air holes near the top where nobody noticed, drove it in the garden just in case the garbage man came along or something, wrote ""trash belongs in the trash bin"" and ""trash doesn't wear clothes"" on myself, set inside the trash can, naked, with the time lock box, locked it up, put the key in the box and there I was.
I did stuff like this for some time, time-locking myself up in uncomfortable situations, when I decided that I ""liked"" my ""punishments"" too much and in order to be ""punished""I had to do something I ""hated"". I remembered that as a kid, until ten or eleven or something, I hated to go to ballet where my mom would want me to go (there was no ""drill to become a prima ballerina"" behind it, she just though it was a good way to make friends which was dumb because I had friends, she just didn't like them), so I searched for this silly ballerina costume in the attic and squeezed myself into it, it was very thigh of course but it just so fit as I’m fucking small. My ballerinas didn’t fit any more so I bought new ones, and at first I just handcuffed my arms and legs and tiptoed through the house doing housework, but it felt not like enough so I just cuffed my arms together and made a split on the floor the next time I did it, which kind of caused muscle pain but the next time I did it I wanted ""more"", so I tailored a slit into the costume, handcuffed my hands, and made a split on a thick (unlit) wax candle that I had glued to a mouse pad as bracket. I went even crazier the next time, I took the electroshock-joystick, remembered that I had a gag that I didn't use in ages, and prepared my ""punishment"", I made a split between two wood posts that stand in the entrance room of our house and onto that electroshock-joystick, tied my feet onto the wood posts with padlocks and chains, gagged myself, turned on the electroshock-joystick, tied my hands between my back with a normal handcuff, threw all the keys in the time lock box behind my back and sat there for a while. This was the first and only time I used something painful together with the time lock box because even though it was just right the first time I just realised that at some point you are shocked or burned or hit enough and then what do you do if the time doesn’t run out.

After a while of doing more ""normal"" stuff again I however felt like completely humiliating myself for whatever reason, and even though I did a lot of weird things that is the only one where I though afterwards ""why did I do this"". I drank a huge amount of water, put on my costume, time-locked myself to a garden chair in our garden for a long time, and just sat there until I couldn't hold it any longer and peed myself and then just sat there in my piss until the time lock opened feeling “wonderfully guilty” (I can’t describe it any different), than afterwards I ""had to"" wash the costume naked in the garden, and in return wear the completely wet costume for the rest of the day while I ""had to"" clean the house while cuffed up. This was pretty much during the day so whenever I had to pee again I ""had to"" use the garden-shower because I ""wasn't allowed"" to take the costume off, only to wash it. I did this ""cycle"" until it was dark and I decided it was time to sleep, and because I used it kind of a lot this day I ""had to"" sleep   on the garden shower, in the wet ballet costume tied to it with my dog leash.
That was pretty recently and afterwards I only did ""smaller"" things again, because even though I liked my ""humiliation-day"" I’m kind of creeped out by what I would do to myself.

They were celebrating and we chatted for a while. One of them was obviously hitting on me so the first chance we got, we left and headed back to mine. 

When we arrived in my room, i was clear headed. We listened to some music and he made his move. He made me cum a lot. Usually at this point i just give the guy a handjob/blowjob and roll over and fall asleep as i don't particularly like one night stands. But he wasn't getting hard over that so i realised that i was going to have to fuck him. Also he was making me cum so much i wanted to reciprocate. I found a condom and got on top until he came. We chatted and fell asleep beside each other.

About 2 hours later he gets up and leaves, he says bye and that's it. I got his first name and age, also a bit of random trivia. He has my name. I feel nothing. No guilt or shame or happiness or regret. I just feel empty.

My parents had brought me along.  One day I was trying out windsurfing, because I'd done it before at a summer camp.

Things weren't going well, and I managed to drift over to a swimming area and got tangled up in the ropes that marked off the deep end.  After struggling with it, I just brought the sailboard back to shore.

About ten minutes later, there was a big commotion over by the swimming area.  A man was found hung up on the swim area ropes right where I had been stuck just before with the sailboard.   

He wasn't breathing and was pulled to shore.  My mom had been on the beach nearby, and since she was a nurse she and some other guy started CPR. 

 Because I was a scared shitless teen, I slowly walked away from the crowd hoping nobody would put things together and recognize me.  They were unable to revive the guy and he died.

He was there on his honeymoon with his new bride, both in their mid-twenties.  She said afterwards that he wasn't a good swimmer and probably got too tired.  Nobody ever connected me with it.

I've never told anyone, and it's haunted me all this tine.  Since I recently found this subreddit, I figured I could let it out to anonymous folks and maybe unload some of the guilt.

It's around this time that we discard any religious beliefs we have (my SO in the fantasy is usually Atheist or a Satanist) and devote our free time to the pursuit of hedonism. Sometimes we'd worship ourselves as gods and sometimes we'd worship Satan as the lord of all pleasure.
Now things start to get really weird. We begin to spend a lot of our free time just having sex and ravishing our own and each others bodies. Suddenly either the apocalypse or the rapture happens. The world ends and we are judged to be evil in the eyes of God and are thrown naked into hell. Trapped in our mortal coils and facing the savages of hell, we must fuck for all eternity as that is the only thing that pleases the dark lord. He occasionally throws us onto spikes and into lakes of fire where we must fuck in the agony of hell. Eventually Satan gets bored of us and destroys our souls, ending our sinful existence forever.

In my original post, I don't think I managed to convey my love for Ben. Some of you probably snort, how can you love someone you fear and think horrible things of. He is still my son, my little boy. I carried him for nine months and dreamed dreams of the man he could become. 

I have many bad memories of his childhood, violent acts/aggressive or antisocial behavior, but I have good memories. He was always a bedwetter, so most mornings it would be the two of us up first and we would just watch cartoons together and drink coco and I would rub his hair. We have family trips and holidays and all of that. We have had good times.

A part of me looks at him and sees his potential. He is a tall, handsome boy (girls stop and point at him, once even taking a picture with their phone) and is a smart kid. He is obsessed with bikes and talented at math and puzzles. 

Unfortunately, I see the danger. I know him better than anyone and I fear the potential. The potential for cruelty, his penchant to hurt. Shortly after I made the first post this came out and he threw his brother, his little brother who is half his size, through a window for using his bike. Luckily, Cam was only slightly hurt. But that was when I realized he couldn't be in this house and so did my husband, who has always been the most adamant that sending him anywhere would be more harm than good.

We found a military school and he's been there four months. It is going well. His grades are good and he even received some monthly awards. I almost found hope again. Until we visited last month. He informed me that he would be good until he was 18 and could do as he wanted (""I was stupid, not to just wait my time to do things my way- I know that now, mom"") so we might as well save the money and bring him home. That he was only ""playing good"" around the right people and that's all it takes to do well there.

Overall, he doesn't mind being there, just said it was a waste for us all, and mostly asked for money for snacks and for us to send his bikes when he gained the privilege. He still despises his younger brother. I will never understand his hatred of Cam, just that occurred from the moment he saw him and has never desisted. 

I hope the best. Maybe three years of playing good will rub off and he will learn to live in society.Maybe he'll be toxic but not criminally, or maybe he'll make a killing a wall street or maybe he'll kill. Maybe not. But this is the end of our rope. We don't know what else to do. We can only hope for the best. That the good will win out. 

I did a paternity test before we sent him to military school, I was so conflicted- his therapists have always said keeping him home, close to loved ones and connection was the best thing we could do- and I feared that Ben's paternity was all in my head. Unfortunately, I was right- Ben is not my husband's son. I should've known to look at them- all behavior issues aside. Ben is so fair and lean, and very tall, where my husband is dark and broad and I'm a tiny red head. I obviously have not and will not tell either one. It could only cause more hurt.

And I conformed to it for so very long. Thinking that I was victim of some generational monster that was plaguing relationships these days. Always confused and hurt and frustrated by why these girls were constantly and relentlessly fucking me over. I was always a nice guy, right? Holding the door, texting sweet and silly messages and always looking for some way to wow or surprise those that I was suiting. I was a gentleman. A dying breed. I was the knight in shining armor, the one who was there to prove that chivalry was not lost, right? Well here is my story. A real ""nice guy"".

August 2011, had just moved out with my wife of one year. I moved into an apartment with a friend and his girlfriend of the time. Things had been great in my first year of marriage. I loved my wife, our story was one that you read about in books or saw in a movie. Magic from day one. Never a day went by we didn't spend all day talking every and any time we got the chance. She wasn't good to me, she was great to me. I couldn't have possibly or even still possibly ask anything more from a woman. I romanced her every chance I got. I was cheesy as hell and she ate it up. 

Well, later that same month, a girl that had recently joined the department at my work seemed to catch my eye. I don't know how it happened and I don't really like recalling the events that unfolded from that unfortunate series of bad decisions. She was wild, independent, strong. She had an air of authority about her, a leader. And I loved it about her. 

I was stupid. I let my eye wander. I got her number after slight hesitation from her. She knew I was married and didn't want to smear her name by being seen talking to me (which was ironic finding out things that people knew about her later). Things didn't take long to escalate, she said she wanted sex (I don't believe this is important to the story, but she was 2-3 months pregnant at the time by some one who had committed suicide due to her sexual indiscretions and was currently dating the man who had inadvertently and indirectly contributed to it all) she stated that the man she was with simply was not pleasing her well enough. She also said while it turned her on that I was married, that no one could ever know about it lest she be labelled a home wrecker. 

So I go home that night, wild fantasies on my mind, texting this girl a mile a minute. The woman that loved me unconditionally waiting for me as I enter the door ""Hey babe, how was work?"" I grunt in her general direction as I walk past her, staring at my phone, at the messages of this new... interest? An awakening deep inside me, the thought, or idea that I didn't need to settle. I was still young. I could do better, right? If this woman I was with loved me, surely some one else could too... Some one... Better? 

Dinner was quiet, she knew. She knew something was up. And why wouldn't she? She knew everything about me, everything I loved, everything I hated. I had only entertained the idea of cheating on her, I hadn't even followed through with the act yet. But she knew that something had changed. And I can only image the fear in the pit of her stomach as she sat there slowly trying to swallow the bites of her food in her dry mouth.

I ignored her most of the next week. While I was in bliss. I felt alive, I felt that high, that drug, the excitement of something new and the risk of getting caught, from possibly both ends. Finally talk of following through with the deed got more and more frequent. And I suffered a slight and brief relapse into the plane of reality. I was going to hurt my wife. I think it was more for my own sake than hers that I felt this way. I didn't want to keep her from getting hurt/ I felt guilty and I wanted that feeling to go away. So I came forward with the proposition that we needed to have an open relationship. 

I explained to her while she cried on our bed that I felt I got married too early in life and that I felt like I didn't get to fully explore and experience my sexuality before I settled down and married her (We were each other's first love and lover). She reluctantly, but eventually agreed and we laid down some ground rules that we wouldn't go after each other's friends and that we would eventually stop. Problem solved, right? I was in the clear and wouldn't be cheating. She was fine, she was just being ""immature"" and ""old fashioned"". 

Well, as things went, I didn't actually get to do anything sexual with this girl for some time, aside from sexting or the occasional makeout session. But, we talked every day. And not just about physical things, about how each other felt and what we wanted to do with our lives etc. It was now about three weeks to a month after I first started talking to her and I was more distant from my wife than I ever thought two people in a relationship could be without being apart. I still had sex with her, and she complied because it was the only time that I still showed emotion towards her. The only time I told her I loved her and told her the ""way she made me feel"". When we were done, I would walk out of the room and text the girl. 

This is about the time things ended with us. I get a text from the side-girl one day and she asks me what would happen if she wanted a relationship with me. I told her that my wife would be gone in a heartbeat. That I would kick her out. And I did. That night I told her that I didn't love her anymore. That I didn't feel the way I used to and we needed to end things. I told her that the open relationship was not going to work, that things weren't going to fix themselves. So she packed up her belongings, barely being able to see past her tears. She didn't take anything of mine or try any spiteful acts of revenge. She quietly and gracefully took what was hers and had her mother come pick her up. 

I would like to take a moment and say I am not entirely without a heart. It got to me. More than I thought it would. I walked out into the living room after it had all transpired. My buddy was sitting on the couch confused as to what was going on. I told him I needed to get out of the house. So we drove around for about an hour while I cried and told him I didn't know what I was doing. He didn't know about any of this and I felt so isolated and scared that I couldn't tell anyone the truth, how could I?

I made up so many cover stories for my friends, ""She just wouldn't do anything around the house"". ""We just couldn't have a conversation without arguing"". Which this was true, to an extent. I'm sure my feelings of needing something new and exciting were bubbling up inside me longer than I had realized. And I had subconsciously started distancing myself from her. But I took no blame on this. I placed it squarely on her shoulders.

I pursued this girl, I devoted my existence to her. I spent every moment I could doing everything in my power to better my cause with her. She was still dating the same man that she had been with when all of this started. She said that he deserved a chance raising her unborn child. And that until she gave him one, I could only wait. And I willingly submitted myself to her scheme. 

We were intimate once at this point. While her boyfriend was out of town. It was the moment we were waiting for, what I had started all this over. After that there was no opportunity as she was getting along in her pregnancy and she claimed it caused her discomfort. 

But I didn't mind, it wasn't intimacy I was looking for at this point. It was her love, I had slowly but truly fallen in love with her. As sick and twisted as this whole situation was, I genuinely loved this girl. So... I did what any logical person in my situation would do. I told her. I cannot describe what happened next. I suppose the only thing I could compare it to would be if a locomotive going at full speed were to suddenly hit a wall of titanium reinforced blocks of lead. She pulled a 180 so fast I still suffer from the lingering effects of whiplash at night. 

She wanted everything to stop. Right there. I was broken. Shattered. I overreacted, I spooked her, I suddenly turned into a desperately raving lunatic. I need you! I pleaded. I can't live without you, you're my world! I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. What a bitch! She screwed me over! what kind of sick, twisted, cruel monster would do a thing like that?! I devoted my everything to her and she just chewed me up and spit me out. 

Well, after a week of moping I some how convinced her to give me another shot, because she owed me that chance she promised. Well, unfortunately for my ex, whom I had given the inclination that I had come to my senses and wanted her back, was again pushed to the side for my pursuit of happiness. 

So things continued on like this for some time. A little of a year to be exact. Things would yo-yo back and forth, she eventually dumped her boyfriend, got back with him a few times, all the while dating other guys. All the while I was on the sideline proclaiming my love for her. Getting angry, frustrated when she dated other guys, guys whom she just met, guys whom I was better than, smarter than, more polite than. And above all, loved her more than, more than anyone could ever understand. How could this cruel heartless bitch whom I loved more than life itself possibly think of ever entertain the idea of another man when there was one right here. One that would treat her right and never let her down. A real ""nice guy"" her knight in shining armor. The one who was going to bring chivalry back. 

(Don't get me wrong, this girl was indeed a horrible person in my honest and now detached opinion, she hurt a lot more people than just I. But that isn't the point of the story)

I spent every moment I could expressing this rage to others. ""Nice guys finish last! I don't understand why girls don't just want a nice guy who will treat them right! Girls just want to go out and fuck and whore for attention!"" I got to the point where people didn't want to talk to me anymore. All I could do was complain about this girl (The cat was out of the bag by the way, because as far as anyone knew, I started talking to her after I kicked my ""horrible"" wife out). She consumed everything I was and I was obsessed with her. 

All this time I kept my ex on the back burner, always giving her a glimmer of hope, just a thread to hold on to. She was a safety buffer, something to fall back on (Just as I was to this girl, but that was something I had not realized yet).

And threw all of this, I felt convinced I was in the right with all of this. I was starting to believe my own lies. I was a good guy, right? Right. I was doing the right thing. Girls just couldn't see and appreciate me for who I was. I was just too nice. Yeah... that's what it was ""Nice guys finish last"". I cared too much, I was just too much of a softie. A victim of my own emotions.

I can see now I have never been more wrong. I was a monster. A cruel and selfish being only capable of my own greedy desires. I was a hypocrite and and very large one at that. I took my loving wife for granted as well as my friends (whom are better to me than I deserve) as I ruthlessly slashed away at all who stood in the way of what I wanted. I was twisted and I didn't even realize it. I was helping another human cheat on her boyfriend. I was aiding in the violation of basic trust and intimacy. I would gain a smug satisfaction in her amazingly convincing stories of where she was at and what she was doing to her loving boyfriend (I don't know if he was a good guy or not, she had some pretty stories about how controlling and inconsiderate he was, but that was irrelevant) when he called her on the cell phone (she always put him on speaker phone when he called, something I never understood.) sometimes she would be topless as I was giving her a massage, or we would be temporarily paused in whatever physical situation we were in, so she could answer the phone. And she never wanted me to stop what I was doing if it didn't hinder her from the call. Any time I complained about her, when things eventually went south again, I would mention this to people. How sick and twisted she could be. But... that was me enabling her. Yes, it was horrible, but I was just as bad. Every bit as guilty as her for aiding her in it. 

I had no consideration for this man she was with. And I relished in the fact that she was sneaking around with me. I felt confident, I felt... superior. I had no thought to how crushed he would be if he found out she was violating his trust in her. As I had no thought to what my ex must have been feeling as she more than likely cried herself to sleep, alone in her own bed for over a year, knowing her, probably thinking what she had done wrong. 

My complaints about this girl got more frequent and more heated, I started lashing out at her for the hell she was putting me through. One day things would be fine and I would feel loved, the next she would push me to the curb and not give me the time of day. How could she do this? I would never do this to her. I would never do this to anyone. 

This continued on into other pursuits that I started. Some out of sheer loneliness, or perhaps to make this object of all my admiration and love jealous. All the while keeping my ex on the back burner. Some of my pursuits would work out and just as I was settling into something new, thinking that I could get my head back on straight, I would... I want to say ""let her"", but that is putting too much blame on this girls shoulders. I would ""more than willingly allow"" her to wedge herself back into my life and I would screw things up all over again. And when I was back on my own again, after she inevitably left me on my own once more, I would scream to the world once again... ""Nice guys finish last! I just want to find a girl who will appreciate me for me!"" When I was, in fact running over those very girls left and right. 

There were a few times, near the end of it all, where things were great. I really thought I was going to end up settling with this girl, she said she loved me. Who knows if she really meant it or not. It is all irrelevant. I fell for it once again and I got my ass burned. This was about attempt #5 or #6 in a year time frame. Not only was I a selfish monster, I was a stupid one. Nothing could stop me in my now, pointless and utterly drained attempt at getting what I wanted. I did love her yes, but part of me was simply frustrated that I put so much time into something that I clearly hadn't, and like a little kid I was throwing a tantrum. 

To wrap all this up. I have since cut all contact with her(and it's been months, which is an accomplishment for me). Every single text, picture, email, poem, college paper I ever wrote for her or even hint of her existence is out of my life. I have made no attempt to contact her or my ex and we are now divorced. She is, as far as I'm aware, happily dating a man and I have no intention of even possibly ruining that for her. 

I was not a ""nice guy"" and if I thought for a second I was, there was no place that I deserved to finish in more than last. I was cruel, I was inconsiderate and I was the very monster I was preaching so hard against. I don't know if I even trust myself to ever treat a woman the way she truly deserves to be, as a human being deserves to be. And even if I did, I don't know if I even deserve happiness. Looking back I find myself to be the true monster in this story. I knew what I was doing and I gladly let myself believe my lies. I let the love of my life down, I let my friends down, and I let myself down. 

So if you ever find yourself hating the world or complaining about some one that has wronged you, think about what you have done to contribute to the situation... Don't ever let yourself go without due blame. And be careful believing people who claim that they are just victims of being ""too nice"".",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_1hora5,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hora5/nice_guys_finish_last/,

I had gotten into my first real relationship. With a girl who i will just call Lady. She was about 12 at the time. Give or take a year for both of us. We had been dating for about six months and we had sex for the first time. (i was staying at her house for a few days and things just happened) Did not think much of it. 

Roughly a month later.  I went camping with her and her family, It went fine for the first 2 of 3 days or so. The third day her mom told her she could drink for her first time.  So she did.. A lot. And she quickly became tipsy and angry. We always had this thing where we steal each others seats and flirt and sit on each others lap. She left for a few minutes and i sat in her seat when she came back she was not flirty. She was mad at me for it. Furious and she attacked me she grabbed my hand and pulled the fingers in opposite directions. Skin tore. bones fractured i went to the hospital the next day had it bandanged till then. 

Well anyway, when she attacked me i freaked out (it really hurt) so i pushed her and she fell down. I did not think much of it besides self defense. But immediately her entire family starts yelling at me and shouting death threats. I was terrified i did not know what was happening.

The next morning after being shunned. She came to me and told me. She was pregnant, and.. when she fell.. it was aborted.. And that's why the family were shouting threats at me. 

When we got back into town she instantly dumped me and started telling everyone i had raped and then attacked her so i would not have to own it. Even though the hospital and police did an investigation and found no evidence of either. Her mom was fined for the alcohol and she was got a warning about my hand though, that part they always leave out.

I spent the next year, being stalked by her brother. 3 of them. 1 tried to attack me at my best friends birthday party. One tried to attack me at school. I took self defense just because of them. They would bike around a half block from my house in circles. So i never left anywhere and would not let my friends come over.

After this year of torture they moved away.. that was.. 5 years ago or so. And i am still terrified that someone will stab me someday, and every now and then i still cry because of what happened when i was 13.  

It made me who i am, I do not drink, I do not smoke. I go nowhere alone. I do not let anyone i know do any of those things near me. I still practice self defense. A grand total of about.. 5 people know what happened. And. i guess now reddit does. But its ok, I was feeling upset about it. Found this subreddit and decided to vent or i was gonna go crazy tonight and i would not be able to sleep. I hope this helps keep me calm. 

Ask me questions if you would like. I will answer as many as i can. And more in the morning.

I think he took this to mean i wanted him, which I didn't. I was in a committed relationship at the time.

He came over to my house very drunk one night, and started touching me/trying to kiss me. I told him to stop and asked him to leave. He didn't. He kept trying to kiss me/touch me and I became very scared. I tried to calm him by trying to get him to instead sit down, because I intuitively fet that if I resisted him he would have become violent and hurt me. He pushed me inside and locked the door. I was very scared at this point. He was very drunk and forceful, and I had never seen this side of him before. He seemed to be like a different person.

I had my sisters daughter upstairs asleep in the second bedroom because I was babysitting, and was petrified that he would hurt her if he knew she was there, he asked to go up to my bedroom and I tried to get in front of him so he couldn't go up the stairs near my niece.

It's important to note at this point that I was 5""6 and thin/petite, and he was 6""3 and an athletic muscular man (27). He pushed me up the stairs but I didn't scream because I was afraid my niece would wake up.

Once in my bedroom I tried to get him to just sit down and talk, again, afraid of what he would do if I fought hard, I was trying to play it softly and calmly because my resistance seemed to make him more agressive. I suggest he go home again, and he just kept touching me. For some reason, I didn't scream and call to my neighbours for help. I think I thought I could handle the situation even though I was scared.

I kept telling him to stop as he touched me but then he forced himself on top of me and held me down while he raped me. I tried to resist physically without screaming but I couldn't. I kept saying NO and it seemed to make him wild with fury and excitement. So i just laid there quietly and 'took it' until it was all over, but here's where it get weird..towards the end I had a spontaneous orgasm (I had not had an orgasm before) and it felt very enjoyable. I still think about it to this day and the idea of being raped makes me feel sexual.

As soon as it was over, he left. I felt so confused. I still do. I told a friend about it recently and they said I wasn't actually raped since I orgasmed. 

He told his girlfriend that I hit on him and she believed him. I lost my whole friends group. I told my dad and he told me I was overreacting. My boyfriend broke up with me and accused me of cheating.

Pedro had a habit of smoking weed and drinking beer in turn I became accustomed his behavior while intoxicated.

One night his weed dealer came over they smoked a bowl in the garage while I sat on the couch in the basement his dealer leaves then Pedro walks down into the basement. Pedro's parents are asleep upstairs and Pedro himself is completely wasted from a combination of drinking and smoking he starts making sexual advances on me I say no he replies with he will ''Shove his dick down my mouth''. He begged me over and over then tells me he will have a girl that gives him blow jobs in exchange for weed to give me a blowjob in the morning.

Now I've been at Pedro's house for a few days and have been bumming it out I felt like I should contribute since I'm staying there and Pedro promises me a girl will pleasure me the next day. I made the choice to go through and do it I slowly pulled down his pants took my right hand and gradually began whacking away on his penis I instantly got a throbbing erection my sexual desire's took over and I pulled down my zipper threw my pants to the side Pedro took his left hand began fondling my balls and starts jacking me off.

While whacking each other off I felt a barrage of sensations I had never experienced up to that point in my life the sheer amount of constant pleasure without having to touch myself. After 15 sweat induced minutes Pedro tells me he is going to ejaculate I pull my hand away in which he abruptly ejaculates all over a towel Three minutes later I tell Pedro to stop and I ejaculate into the same towel. I wipe leftover sperm off my thighs he goes into the bathroom nearby cleans himself up then goes to sleep in his room upstairs I fall asleep on the couch. The following morning Pedro called the girl he promised me but she wasn't in town I ended up leaving later on in the day. I haven't spoke with Pedro since the incident it wouldn't feel right seeing him again after what happened.

I feel used over what happened that night I have questioned my sexuality ever since but it also made me progress as a person and I have learned to be less trustworthy of people.

1361662919.0,100,self.confession,193rwo,I ratted out a friend to his girlfriend and broke their relationship (but I still think he deserved it),121,21,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/193rwo/i_ratted_out_a_friend_to_his_girlfriend_and_broke/,"Before telling the actual story (which is quite straightforward, and the title pretty much says it all) I need to give you some context.

I have a group of friends back in my hometown, that goes back to when we were in high school. After moving away for college I started to drift apart, and only saw them occasionally. On one of this occasions I found out that for fuck knows what reason a few of them had fallen into the habit of cheating on their girlfriends with random (possibly drunk) girls they picked at bars. They were all in their second or third year of relationship, when things start to get serious and couples usually have doubts, so I guess they didn't saw it so much as actual cheating than a ""weekend relief"" because there was not ""real sex"", just making out, a handjob or a blowjob in a car.

Just to be clear, I'm not defending them, just trying to understand why the hell did that. I still think they were behaving like complete morons, which brings us to the story.

Apparently one of them had taken things a step further and had been seeing another girl. It was just sex (or so he told me), but it had been happening for quite some time. He had managed to keep it secret for so long because she lived in a distant place and they only saw each other every now and then. The reason why he finally confessed it to me was that he had began to feel remorse because he had realized he truly loved his girlfriend and didn't want to jeopardize that relationship. To top the cliche, he said he wanted to break up with the other girl but didn't really know how. In different circumstances I may have felt sorry for him, but I knew his cheating was part of a moronic 'phase' my friends were going through, and he was so immature he couldn't end his affair properly (at some point he even considered pretending he had a terminal sickness and break all contact, I shit you not).

Fast forward a few days, and by complete chance I met this guy's girlfriend in a bar. We were both on our own, and though we had never spoken much before that day she approached me for a chat. Not without a reason, because as it turns out she told me she had started to suspect she was being cheated on. My friend had been behaving strangely, disappearing for whole weekends, and he had also made the number one mistake of cheaters all around the globe: not only he was texting the other girl, but also wasn't deleting the messages and often left his cellphone lying around. So just a few days before our encounter she had picked the phone, read the texts and confronted him about them. She told me he denied everything, and either the texts were not clear enough or my friend is a damn good liar because he managed to make her doubt about the whole story.

That's when she asked me. She looked me in the eye, told me she didn't know what to think anymore and asked me if I knew anything about it. The truth is I barely knew this girl, and friends are not supposed to rat out other friends, but I did know she was a good person who didn't deserve to be cheated on and lied about. So I told her the truth. Even after her suspicions she was devastated, so she called my friend the next day and broke up with him. No ifs, no buts, no second chances.

I never saw this girl again after that, but I have to give her credit: to this day my friend still doesn't know who ratted him out. He probably doesn't care much now because he is married and has kids, and I barely see him once a year, but there's a part of me that is still scared of what would happen if he found out. I would do it again, though, because I still think what he did was absolutely despicable (not only the cheating, but also the mind games), and if we ever get to talk about this that's what I will tell him.

**tl;dr A friend of mine cheated on his girlfriend, she asked me for confirmation when she started to suspect and I ratted him out because I thought he was a moron.**

Tonight my boyfriend is gone for good. No dick is worth his problems. Before I had to go to work we got into an argument about how we had both agreed to get help together. He was going to go to an outpatient drug rehab program and I was going to either join a support group or see a therapist. Today, he admited to making that very serious promise just to "" get me to shut my mouth "". I begged with him to reconsider, only to be called a crazy bitch. I cried and cried, all he could do was stare at the wall.

When I went to work ( on less than an hour of sleep due to the stress ) he decided to do dope with his friends in our apartment. I have never been as strong as I was then. I told them all to get the fuck out and they scrambled. None of them could make eye contact with me. I was texting him at work out of worry that he may decide to do heroin today and he said he had, but blamed it all on me pushing him.

I broke down at work and drove home to find him here with his friends. Needless to say, he is getting his clothes tomorrow and I have told him I never want to see him again. This time I mean it.

I had a good father who spoiled me and was always around. Nothing more than being an involved, active, nurturing parent. Somewhere in my childhood, I got a crush on my dad. I decided I wanted to marry him since he was the perfect man. I was a kid, so I of course didn't really understand marriage and/or incest terribly well. I'd fake nightmares at night so I could crawl into bed between my parents. Whenever he and I went out to lunch together or watched movies together, I believed they were dates. It never went sexual, but somehow in my mind I'd decided that he was my boyfriend. This went on for years.

When I got to being a teenager, I started masturbating. It was always him I thought about. I truly cant remember a single other crush I had. I started reading erotica on websites about Daddy/daughter stuff. That's when I started really thinking about him sexually. For a long time I just did stuff like walking in on him in the bathroom, and sitting on his lap a lot. 

A couple nights when my mom wasn't home, I snuck into his room at night. He sometimes got hard while he slept and I could see the outline of his penis through his underwear. One of those nights I tried to slide his underwear down without waking him up. I wasn't going to do anything, I just wanted to see. He woke up. Obviously freaked out, told my mother, my parents sought therapy for me. My dad got so distant after that. Never touched me again, not even a hug.

I therapy'd my way through it, but sometimes I feel that the only real result of my therapy was to teach me to feel guilty about it and to hide it. The story I stick with to those few in my family that know is that it was simply an adolescent phase brought about by wild hormone changes. It hasn't been brought up in years.

The truth is that I feel like I'll never be attracted to another man the way I felt about him back then. I'm 25 now.

1348678908.0,99,self.confession,10ijak,I've been fapping to pornographic pictures of my sister for weeks now and I can't stop.,148,49,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/10ijak/ive_been_fapping_to_pornographic_pictures_of_my/,"My older sister (me 19 her 21) attends an out of state college and lives on campus during the summer. I still live at home and commute to a nearby state college like a loser. A few months ago we were chatting online and she told me that she had broken up with the man she'd been dating since first moving out there a couple years back. She would not give any details but said that I should tell our parents cause it would make them happy. Sis and our parents don't get along very much and they really disliked this bf supposedly cause of the age difference (h'e over ten years older than her) but really cause he's Arabic and our parents our racists who think every arabic person is a terrorist.

Well not long after she broke up with him I got an e-mail one morning from someone I didn't know with the subject titled ""Your sweet and innocent sister Jane"" (her name isn't Jane but the e-mail did mention her real name). Normally I would have deleted it as spam but my sister's name is pretty unique so I figured I should check it out.

Three e-mails in total, all from same address, all with just attached RAR files. After scanning them for viruses I opened them. What I found was over sixty megabytes of JPG files over a hundred pictures of varying quality (some high res some shitty camera phone shots). The pictures are of Jane, my sister, doing everything you can imagine: sucking cock, fucking, cum shots, multiple guys at the same time. All amateur pictures so I don't think they're from a website or anything it's like whoever sent me the pictures took them himself. It's definitely Jane by the way either that or an evil twin we've never heard of who decided to get the same piercings and an identical tatoo on her right shoulderblade. 

At first I was horrified but I couldn't stop looking at them in spite of that. My sister was never very wild or slutty when she lived here at home in fact she dated the same clean cut boy all through highschool before moving out of state. She got decent grades and still does not genius level or nothing but really good. Seeing her in these pictures makes me wonder WTF kind of relationship was she in with the Arabic guy? Did he know about what she was doing with all these men? Cause my guess is there's at least nien different guys between all these pictures. In some you can't see their faces so it's hard to tell.

Why was she doing this? Only a few of the pictures look like they could have been taken secretly the rest it'd be impossible to hide the camera and in a lot of them she's actually playing to the camera like winking or smiling directly into the lense. Was she getting paid to do all this? Just doing it for fun? Or was she being forced somehow?

Okay so now the big question- who sent me these pics? Obvious answer is the ex-bf. I don't know why they broke up exactly but I got the feeling from the chat with Jane that it was not a cordial breakup. Now I only met him once when she brought him home once for a holiday last year but it turned out he played on Steam too and we hit it off talking about videogames. I even gave him my s/n and e-mail address so we could play together. Never really happened but he did have that info. Also he could have gotten my e-mail address from e-mails my sister sent to both of us which she has done before.

First thing I should have done was delete these e-mails and tell my sister about them but I didn't. Instead I've been fapping to them all the time. I have a girlfriend and she just said a few days ago that she thinks I might be cheating on her because I have no sex drive. I have no sex drive because I'd rather fap to pictures of my sister being a total slut than fuck her! It's sick. I know that. But when I try to delete the pictures I just can't.

This situation has me confused as fuck. I feel guilty, angry, horny, pathetic, you name it. Not to long ago I was chatting with Jane about an upcoming family thing and I actually typed out something like ""I know you sent me your slut pictures"" but thankfully I didn't send the message. But see that's one of my fantasies to, that she sent me the pictures herself! Fucked up so fucked up.

They don't say racist things to me, but I can't help but think that as soon as I'm out of the room they are jumping at the chance to call me a nigger. I know there are plenty of White people who are decent people (just like any other race), and those racist shitbags don't represent all of you but I am so fed up with the hypocrisy on this site and now the thought these views are common but hidden amongst my White friends is driving me crazy.

Is it unreasonable? **Yes** Am I being racist too? **Probably** But from now on, am I  only going to befriend fellow minorities because they know what racism feels like and are therefore less likely to be racist towards me??? **Fucking Aye**  

In closing, fuck you reddit and fuck you white people. I hope one day you understand what it's like to have your humanity stripped away with one ugly word or ignorant stereotype. Until then, stay fucked.

My long term girlfriend has been gradually gaining weight and I am not attracted to her the way I used to be. Thus, our sex life has become almost a chore. I've not told her this is the reason I don't initiate anymore. To rekindle our fire, I suggested trying kinkier things in bed, even inviting another woman into the mix, both of which she shot down. All of these I used as justification for cheating.   

On a lark, and against my better judgement, I posted an ad to craigslist personals m4w.  

Along with the slew of bots, cam girls, scam sites and spam, was one very real, and very crazy female. We started exchanging emails over the course of a week. I never intended to follow through, just knowing I had options was a thrill for me.   

The email chain got stranger, and should have set off alarms in my head. I determined she was more interested in drugs than anything else, after I mentioned I had around 40 leftover painkillers from a surgery and that became the focal point of every subsequent message.      

Last night, I drove to her neighborhood, she snuck me in her window, and we smoked pot and popped painkillers til 5:30AM this morning. I have never abused pills in my life. The entire night was one huge warning sign. She exhibited paranoid, schizophrenic behavior, rambling, and general nonsensicalness. It felt like an out of body experience. I kept feeding this girl pills as she demanded them, claiming they weren't working. I think she may have downed up to 15 of them total. I was actually scared the whole time I was there. I knew I was being used for drugs, but if I was gonna get laid, I didn't care.  

She demanded I go down on her first. I did. Then I tell her its my turn. She says she has a sore throat now. I tell her try anyway, you said you would, knowing full well she was bullshitting me. She blows me for 1 minute (quite well I might add) and then freaks out, tells me its time for me to go, that we are going to get caught.    

As she's rushing me out of her window, shes demanding I leave her some pills. I empty the script bottle onto her desk (maybe 15 pills left) and put the bottle in my backpack, not wanting my name on anything in her possession. She's claiming she wants to pay me for the pills, so she doesn't feel like she blew me for them. I know full well she has no intentions of paying me now, or ever. I tell her don't worry about it. Keep them. She says just give me a price, cut me a deal. I said fine $10 bucks. She says I'll write you a check. I say forget it, just take them.     

This wasn't enough. Now she says aren't you going to leave me some pot? I said ""No, I don't have time. You are rushing me out of here, but you want me to take time out to leave you more stuff? No way."" And I hopped out the window.   

She texts me furiously, demanding to know why I left her fake pills. They weren't fake, she was just literally outside of her mind at that point. She is screaming via text, why I would trick her and then run away. Fact is, she wasn't tricked. I was so desperate to get out of there and afraid of what she might do, that I just wanted to give her the pills to shut her up. 

I get home at 6AM, my father is awake, looks at me weird. I avoid eye contact, grab a 45 minute power nap before I have to get up for work. I wake up to find a slew of texts from this girl. At first furious, then apologetic, then confused, all of them totally fucked up. I still have yet to respond.       

She knows my real name. She has pictures of me. She has my phone number.    

I feel dirty. I feel ashamed. I feel unworthy of the girl I've been with for 3 years. I feel entirely empty. Here I sit, at my cubicle in my office, at 2PM, still feeling the effects of the 7 painkillers I took last night.    

I've never felt like less of a human being than I do right now.   

Thank you for letting me get this off of my chest. There is nothing that can erase what I have done. I know this entire episode was wrong and could have/ should have been avoided. I'm afraid of what might happen next, should I ignore her.

Like, a lot.  I like the taste, I like the feeling it gives, I like the escape.  I was always convinced it made me better...someone cooler and more likable.  

My dad, and his dad, and probably his dad, too, had an alcohol issue.  But I'm too smart to let myself get sucked into that.  Yea, I know what's going on, I can stop before I have a problem.  That's what I thought anyway.

I went through a stressful time about a year ago and started drinking more.  I didn't think anything of it when I began drinking alone.  It started on the weekends when I would lay out by the pool by myself and have a glass of wine.  Just one glass, no big deal.  Then I started buying 6 packs on weeknights and having a beer or two to unwind after work.  Then it became 12-packs.  Then boxes of wine.  I'd finish a box of wine (5 liters) every 2-3 days, and never saw a problem with it. My tolerance was higher, and it had become part of my normal routine.  

I didn't think anything of it when I started having a constant, deep, dull pain in my right side. I started waking up in the morning tired and grumpy, and I would dread driving to work.  One morning I thought ""oh yea, I'll just have one beer before the drive to get me through the morning.""  Then it was 2.  Then it was every morning.  I don't even want to think about how many times I drove when I shouldn't have...I am ashamed and still feel like such utter scum.  

I played soccer on a local adult team, and I had fully convinced myself that I was a much better player when I was buzzed.  Looking back now, I probably looked like an utter wreck, but I was so sure that the drinks made me more coordinated and less afraid of the ball.  How I didn't break my (or someone else's) leg, I'll never know.

During the work day, I would sit and think about what kind of beer I was going to get from Walgreens on the way home.  When I started seeing this great new guy, I would down a bottle of wine before I'd see him because I thought it made me fun.  He never knew about it...he thought that the 'drunk me' was the real me.  When he started staying over, I hid bottles of 'water' around my closet...they were actually full of vodka, I could sneak a swig every now and then.  

Eventually, he caught me.  I was talking to him with a slurred voice and apparently reeked of liquor.  He isn't a big drinker himself, and was shocked and dissappointed when I told him I was sneaking drinks.  He still doesn't know how bad it really was, but he got on my case and started pressuring me to not drink as often.  When I went to a doctor for an unrelated issue, I discovered I had liver damage...reversible, but far beyond what a normal 24 year old should have.  I was literally killing myself, and thought nothing of it.

Over time, it really started to dawn on me how fucked up my situation was.  Every time I would close myself in the closet, I would feel the hate welling up inside of me.  But then, I would drink once because I wanted it, then again to make the feeling go away.  Later, when I'd pull clothes off the shelves, I'd find empty bottle after empty bottle, hidden in pockets and folds and shoes.

One night I suppose I'd gotten drunker than normal, and stayed up all night on reddit.  My bf and I had been in an argument (I don't remember what it was about) and he was asleep.  I sat there reading posts in the confession subreddit and I suppose I decided to write a confession of my own.  Somewhere near the end, I fell asleep on the floor and never submitted it.  

When I woke up and read what I'd written, I fell to pieces.  It actually broke my heart.  I was so sad, so angry, and so miserable.  I couldn't remember anything I ever did, and I realized that I was dragging myself into an early grave.  Every good thing in my life was being pushed away because I wanted to feel something, and all I felt was numb.  I was using the alcohol as some sort of band aid for a problem I didn't have...I was actually making the problem I was avoiding.    

It's been a hard road since then, and I can't say I've been perfect.  I had to change basically everything about my every day life, but it's been beyond worth it.  I am learning how to be more honest, and I am able to love unhindered.  I feel happiness and sadness and anger full force, and though it can be scary, it's real, and I love it.  I am prettier now...my skin is clear and my eyes aren't bloodshot and my smile is genuine.  

When my bf finally did start to see me sober, it was like he had to meet me all over again.  I wasn't as vocal, I was far more shy, and I did sweet things more often.  I could actually remember things we did together, and jokes he made, and stopped falling asleep in the middle of late night conversations.

I still have an occasional drink, but I am smart about it, and never drink alone.  I am lucky.  Extremely lucky.  And I have this subreddit to thank for that, even though I never actually posted anything at all.

1336868773.0,98,self.confession,tkbik,I grew up in a sexually weird environment. ,129,31,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/tkbik/i_grew_up_in_a_sexually_weird_environment/,"I'm into a lot of taboo things, like incest, beastiality, underage, bdsm, and rape. I used to think that everyone secretly likes these things, but wouldn't talk about it, and that I was just normal. Lately I've been thinking that maybe I was wrong about that and that it was because of some weird experiences that I had growing up. Some of these things are my deepest darkest secrets that I have never told anyone, and I've been thinking about it a lot today for some reason, and I just want to let them out.

When I was really young (under 6), I remember be attracted to my dad. I used to call him my ""boyfriend"" and sit on his lap and try to wiggle on his penis. I didn't know what I was doing. My dad would get hard and sometimes he would act really uncomfortable and make me get away from him.

The first time I kissed anyone was at a slumber party in 4th grade. I made out with 4 of my friends (one at a time) during a game of truth or dare. We kept having slumber parties over the course of a year or two and kept making out with each other as dares, but eventually things progressed. By 5th grade, we were fingering each other in front of our small group of friends and were even trying to perform acts of beastiality. We made a game of trying to get dogs to have sex with us. We never succeeded in actual penetration (thank Jesus), but we did do ""red rocket"" stuff to dogs.

Around this time, I started masturbating and humping everything. I remember I used to hump stuffed animals and pillows to get off when I got home from school. I had a brother who was 3 years older than I was, and he would try to watch me do it. I remember when I was in 5th grade, I was humping a stuffed animal and caught him hiding in my room, watching me. He pulled it off like it was a prank when I caught him and never brought it up again. Then I would catch him hiding my closet after school. It got to a point that whenever I wanted to get off, I would search my room for him to make sure he wasn't there.

When I was in middle school, we got satellite TV. The dish was right outside my bedroom window. We lived in the country, so I never bothered closing my blinds or anything. One time when I was masturbating, I heard my stepdad yell ""I know you're out there! It's not funny!"" and apparently thought my brother had been blocking the dish to interrupt the reception when my stepdad watched TV as a joke. I looked at my window and saw my brother running away. I'm not sure if he was watching me masturbate, but I think that's what he was really doing, and I'm not sure how many times that happened, but I started closing my blinds.

I started sleeping naked around middle school, because it's way more comfortable. I still can't sleep with clothes on. I started to catch my brother sneaking around my room at night. I don't think he ever touched me. I think it would have woken me up, but I'm not sure. This continued until he moved out when he was 18. I used to have dreams about having sex with him.

I also discovered porn in middle school. My parents had divorced and when I would stay with my dad on the weekends and my dad worked in IT. I had my own computer with internet access in my room and nothing to do for days at time. I would watch beastiality, bdsm, and hentai for hours on end. I also started going into chat rooms to cyber with strangers. Sometimes I wonder if my dad ever realized that I used that computer almost exclusively for weird porn. It makes me feel awful to think that maybe he knew but felt too weird to say anything about it.

I have grown into what most people would consider either a very adventurous or slutty adult. I'm not sure if I'm just very comfortable with my sexuality, and am expressing it in healthy ways, or if I'm just a fucked up person. I like what I like, for whatever reason. I'm not hurting anyone. Everything is consensual, and in case you were wondering, the only things I've done with incest and underage are roleplay. I try to think of sex in a very positive way, and am very open to trying new things, but I can't help but think that maybe I'm making everything worse.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_tkbik,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/tkbik/i_grew_up_in_a_sexually_weird_environment/,

I met her 5 years ago and it was love at first sight. At that time, I thought I was straight. Hell, I'm still in the closet right now. My crush (who we'll call Almond) is very straight. (In fact, as of present time, she's in a 3 year relationship with a man.) I vowed never to tell Almond my feelings because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. I was so head over heals, just being her friend was good enough. So I held my feeling in, denied it some days, because I knew it'll ruin everything.


We eventually became roommates in college. One particular girl in our program (we'll identify as Peanut) became increasingly attached to Almond (who can blame her, the girl is beautiful). At that time, Peanut also identified as straight, but has since come out of the closet. She also fits 12 of the 20 symptoms for a psychopath (mainly manipulativeness). Almond started letting Peanut get really close, and before I knew it, Peanut was sleeping over in our dorm every night.


This is where it gets really painful. Peanut was doing everything I never had the guts to: Whispering sweet nothings in Almond's ear. Kissing her. Telling her how beautiful she was. Making her giggle by just lightly running her fingers down the small of Almond's back. Some nights I couldn't sleep in my own bed because I'll hear those two. This went on for months. They never called it a relationship. I saw it more as a dirty little game Peanut like to play.  Almond would confess to me that she didn't like how Peanut was getting attached to her, that she wasn't attracted to Peanut, that she felt taken advantaged of. And yet, Almond would let Peanut carry on. I didn't know what to do. So I didn't do anything. Coward.


I can't say for certain if those two had sex. Almond would deny it if ever asked. Eventually, Peanut became so possessive and manipulative, Almond ended up hating her. They had a horrible falling out and refuse to speak to each other to this day. Almond and I are now best friends, roommates, I share everything with her (except this secret). I still love her, but I've been able to channel it more into a friendship-type love. There's nothing she can do to hurt me, not after how much I hurt myself to get through the whole Peanut fiasco. 


Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice to keep my feeling bottled up. If our friendship is worth just one night with her.

She is very insecure and quickly feels slighted. She gets angry very easily and when she does she basically throws a hissy fit. She has no restraints and digs up every bit of dirt she can think of just to be hurtful/defend herself. In addition to that she is quite self-centered and finds it very difficult to put herself in somebody else's shoes. 

I managed to cope with it for a long time but since a while I really just want out.

Unfortunately divorce is not an option since she is terrible with the kids. She is annoyed by them very easily and has no empathy at all. At the moment I am the main focus of her anger and frustration, but without me I think the kids would become targets as well. I am sure that even having them stay with her half of the time will mess them up in the long run.

So, I have to stick with it until the kids are old enough. To keep things peaceful I pretend I care about her and even have sex with her although there is no emotional connection for me.

I feel so sorry for having to do this.

Many thanks for the encouraging and helpful comments. Several of you suggested leaving and taking the kids with me. Believe me, there is nothing I would be happier to do. But taking the kids away from her and her away from the kids is something I won't do unless things get really, really ugly.

I've never faced any kind of serious adversity, and everybody I know has always been supportive. I recognize I have a lot to be thankful for; there are people in parts of the world that fear for their lives just because they're gay. That said, this is the worst part of being gay (for me). If you're reading this, thank you for listening to my petty problem. I didn't realize I had this much to say.


He's that classic best friend; we can tell each other anything, we're always hanging out (among our circle of friends), and he's always a good time to be around. I'll call him X. We didn't start hanging out much until several months ago. I had known him from high school, we had a few mutual friends. I always saw X as the older guy that was cute, but knew it wouldn't happen. I didn't think we'd end up as best friends, either. It wasn't much, just a dumb high school crush. Nothing would come of it.


Over time we became friends. Not really close, but we would hang out every now and then if our friends hung out. And here we are, several years after meeting him, and he's my best friend. I spent this entire summer hanging out with X and our circle of friends. He's told me things he would never tell anyone, and I've told him things I couldn't tell anyone. It's great, I've never had as close a friend. This is where it gets kind of complicated, though.


A month or so ago I remembered the high school crush I had on my now best friend. Later, I thought about it again. A few weeks ago it popped back into my head, and I realized what was happening; I was falling for X. But I can't do that, getting a crush on your straight friend is a recipe for disaster. He's not gay or bi at all, but it doesn't stop me from hoping. I know it will never happen, but I want to pick up on signals that aren't there. The little, cute things he does. I don't even want to notice them. I don't want to like him like this. I can't help feeling this way.


If you're still reading, this is where the context ends and the story begins.


Last night we're all hanging out. This had been bugging me for a little while, and I really wanted to tell somebody. I pulled aside the only girl in our close group, she'll be Y. She's the only person that would completely understand. We opened up, she told me her problems, and I unloaded my problem. I didn't want anything more than to just tell her, just so somebody knows. It was stressing me out, especially since I was drinking around X. She promised not to tell anybody.


The biggest problem with falling for your straight best friend isn't the fact that you're crushing on someone you know you can't have. It's not even the anxiety you get whenever you're around him, careful not to misinterpret his friendly gestures as something else. It's the fact that if anybody knew, anybody but Y, it would change everything about our group. I want so badly to just tell him, hoping for a chance of something more, if not just to put the issue to rest. But it doesn't work like that, it would change the dynamics of our whole circle of friends.


Y and I head back inside after our long, heartfelt conversation. It felt good, it was easier now that somebody knew. Y and I sit down and watch TV with everyone when X asks if I want to smoke. He's very drunk at this point, and I'm pretty drunk myself. Of course the only thing on my mind is that I like him, especially after the conversation I had with Y just minutes earlier. It quickly becomes apparent he's got something on his mind, and he wants to tell me something.


Let me preface this: I would never betray a friend's trust, and I promised I wouldn't tell anyone about his problem. I feel bad just saying it on here, but since it's completely anonymous I genuinely don't think anybody would connect any of this to us.


He says he wants to tell me something he's never told anyone. He starts to tell me about an anxiety he has, how he hasn't seriously dated in a while. It had been a long time since he had been close with someone, romantically. He wants to meet a girl, and have a girlfriend. Someone he can tell anything to, who he can be close with and tell everything. I'm dying on the inside.


I'm sitting there, listening to him. I feel so bad for him, I'm comforting him as he cries. At the same time I can't stop thinking about how I like him. I feel like it's a perfect fit, even though I know it won't happen. I feel selfish for even thinking this while he's confiding something like that in me.


We talk for a little while longer as we smoke. All the while I’m falling apart on the inside, making sure not to let it show. I'm glad I can be there for a good friend, but it was so bittersweet. He gives me a big hug, he cries a little bit more, and we go inside.


Here I am, the day after, and I can't stop thinking about it. The juxtaposition of both conversations is killing me. I feel like I don't know what to do, but I know there's nothing I can do. It's just a shitty situation. I really just wanted to get this out and tell someone.

I lived in a fairly dangerous area at the time and wasn't allowed to play outside much.  In addition to that, I was pretty ostracized from the other children on my block because I was ethnically different from them.  I don't hold any grudges now, but at the time, it made my summers very lonely.

At one point I had finally made one friend that lived three houses from me, a girl about a year or so older than me.  God, I can't even remember her name.  That's horrible.  Anyway, that summer we played together frequently and I remember being so happy to have a friend that lived so close.  

Like I mentioned earlier, the neighborhood was a little bit sketchy back then.  There was a notable figure I (and every other kid on the block) encountered every day on my way to school - a man in his 50's who would stand by his front fence every day and chain smoke in silence. He stood there almost every single day, smoking and blatantly staring at anyone that passed, never uttering a word.  Everyone knew of him, but no one knew anything about him.  He was just the resident creeper.

So my new friend and I were playing outside one summer, and we wind up stopping in front of the creeper's house.  That day he wasn't outside, which is what I think made us stop and start to talk about him.  I remember hearing some noise from one of the windows, and suspecting that someone was listening to us so I warned my friend to lower her voice.  But she wasn't scared of anything.  Egged on by my warning, I think, she started talking even louder.  Then she told me, in a mock hushed voice, that she heard the ""creepy fucker"" ate roaches.  

After that, I remember a lot of shouting, followed by two older teenage girls (supposedly his daughters, which was news to us) barreling out of that man's house and screaming at us.  I was terrified, but my friend was a spitfire, she yelled back at them despite the obvious age and size gap.  They slapped her, then pushed her to the ground and began kicking her head.  One of them dragged her back to her feet and held her in a choke hold.  The other girl came for me, but before she could get to me, my friend yelled something insulting to her, and she instantly switched focus from me to my very brave friend.  I remember her being held by one girl while being punched and kicked by the other, all the while she was screaming for me to run home.  

I'll never forget her voice, nor my actions to follow.  I saw her fight as it looked like she was being dragged into their house.  And...I ran home.  I ran, as I was told to, and didn't look back.  I never told my parents because I was convinced the two girls would give me the same treatment they gave to her.  I should have.  I should have said or done something, ANYTHING.  Because I never saw her again.  After a week of being afraid to leave my house, I looked for her, as much as an 8 or 9 year old could.  Her parents never answered the door again and I believe they eventually moved.  I don't know what happened to her.  I don't know if she's even alive.  

All I remember about this girl is that she saved me from an unknown fate that day.  The memory of her has since grown fainter and fainter, but everything that happened in that moment is still very vivid and can be unbearably haunting at times.  Unbearable because of the guilt I feel when I think of her.  Guilt for not being as brave as she was.  Guilt for letting her take a beating and possibly worse in order to give me a window to run.  Guilt for never telling anyone and blocking out most of the memory.  The incredible sadness that comes with the fact that I can't even remember her name.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_tosjs,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/tosjs/i_cant_shake_this_childhood_memory/,

1361128028.0,99,self.confession,18pbkt,When I was a child I was molested by a popular kids television host and I have become sexually deviant as a result.,122,23,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18pbkt/when_i_was_a_child_i_was_molested_by_a_popular/,"This is a pretty long confession but it's something I need to get out.

I've been dancing ever since I was a little girl. When I was 5, my dance class was doing a recital that was mermaid theme for a huge kids event in my city. We were dressed up in cute little mermaid outfits and we were going to be dancing while a popular kids television host was going to be on stage with us. 3 other girls and I had our makeup and costumes done first and we were left waiting in a room for the rest of the girls to get finished. An assistant/friend of the television host came in, talked to one of the moms about how he was going to do a reading to some of the kids who were going to be performing and he wanted to know if the girls who were already finished getting ready could go. The mom agreed and he led me and the other girls to another room with the television host waiting inside of it. From there I never really remembered much except for 3 or 4 vivid details. When I was younger and the memory was nothing but hazy, I would simply feel sick to my stomach.

After that event I was never the same. I became hyper-sexual and tried to illicit sexual favors from my childhood friends. I would purposefully take my clothes off in front of strangers (not in an innocent way, either. I was 9/10 and stripping in front of people) I pressured a friend of mine into having group sex when I was 14 and she has resented me for it. I used to become very violent during sex and it was scary for other people. In fact, I made an old boyfriend of mine pass out from head trauma. (Though I have managed to move past this habit) I masturbated to very questionable material up until a year ago. I have fantasies where I'm being raped and it turns me on.

This isn't even all of it.

All of this and my mental illness aside (obsessive compulsive disorder) I'm a a pretty normal person. People don't usually associate anything sexual with me because I am very calm and serious. 

I recently entered a very serious relationship with a great guy and I opened up to him about most of this (I left some of the things I did when I was a teenager out because I know he wouldn't react well to it) and he shares similar kinks and turn ons because he was taken advantage of when he was younger. However, I don't think he understand the extent of what happened to me and I don't think he ever will. 

The good news is that with personal insight and time I've managed to put most of it behind me. I admit what happened to me and I admit the things I have done. I have attempted to repent to people but only a couple have actually responded. I have hurt a lot of people and I don't think I can ever forgive myself for that but I'm trying my best to move on.

Only he knows about this. I've never told my parents, any friends, my therapist, etc. It's something I felt like I had to confess.

***Edited because of grammar and spelling.

Also, thank you all for being supportive. Since I've received comments and so many messages asking who it was, I will clear this up now: I do know his name. He is retired now. I might go to the authorities about this eventually but for now I am going to keep quiet. It's mainly a comfort thing.

It gave me the excitement and the drive necessary to keep moving forward in life. Even the people in my life, even though our friendships were based off of looking for the next high, were the most interesting, intelligent and hilarious people I’ve ever met. Sure, I’ve dealt with my share of idiot low-lifes but the majority were people, like me, just looking for some meaning in this boring world. We all had similar lives, interests, stories, wants and because of that we had a genuine connection. It seems like life was much simpler and, quite honestly, more fun during those days. 

Looking back, I don’t think I even wanted to get clean but I did so because of pressure from my family. Getting clean was relatively easy but while the drugs were leaving my body, so were my motivation and my enthusiasm for life. That was the difficult part; losing most, if not all, of my will. I still go to work, albeit not as often now, but outside of that I see no reason to get out of bed. Nothing excites me anymore. The people in my life now are dull, predictable and pathetic. I have yet to find anything or anyone interesting and worthwhile. I have my hobbies and they keep me happy but only momentarily.

I miss my old life where each day was an adventure. When I had a close group of people who knew every idiosyncracy of my personality. Maybe I’m viewing things thru rose-colored lenses but those days were the happiest days of my life. Part of me wants to run back but I know it’s futile, I know I’m stuck dealing with yuppies and other stiffs for the rest of my life. I haven’t told anyone about how I feel nowadays, partly because I don’t let too many people close and partly because I’m pretty sure they’ll think I’m crazy. I really don’t know how to deal with everything these days but everyday that goes by I feel more and more of my personality being taken away from me by the burden of being civilized.

It was already midnight so I told her I would come over in the morning when I sobered up. She argued more and more until I finally said I would show up. We went through this same thing a few. I've asked her to come drinking with me before and she refused so I normally go with my friends and she gets upset. When she would get angry and tel me to come to her place I usually showed up in the morning instead of i the middle of the night when I was still drunk.

This time I decided to leave my friends and go straight to her place to make her feel better. When I got there and rang her bell. When she answered she asked me why I was there like she had completely forgotten she asked me over. She took longer than usual to let me in. When I got to her apartment door she blocked me from walking straight in then questioned me about again. When I finally pushed passed her I saw a guy walking out of her room zipping his pants up and towards her roommates door. When I looked at her she started to stutter and then tried to shove me in her room while she went to talk to her roommate and this random guy. I was so drunk I didn't think about any of this until the next day. the guy left that night and I didn't get to confront him. Even though she denies it I know what happened. 'll never forget the smirk on his face as she shoved me in her room. We broke up right after but I think about it every night. I'm over her but I can't get past that one night.

Edit: I haven't been really eating since this happened. I can't sleep for more then a few hours a night and can't focus on anything. I haven't told anyone about this.

I'll try and keep it as simple as I can. Basically I was with this girl, lets call her J. J and I had a thing for a few months, casual sex, hanging out often, nothing out of the ordinary. She had told me multiple times she had no interest in a relationship. Cool. No biggy. Flashback to a few days ago, she tells me her best friend moved across the country and she has no one now. She talks to me very different now, like she wants a relationship. Fuck. This is bad because... There's this other girl. Lets call her T. Let me start by saying T is probably the hottest girl I've ever met in my entire life. But unfortunately, she's also probably the biggest flake I've ever known in my entire life. I've talked to her for about 2 years trying to hang out but she's always busy with something or other. Until a few days ago. She pulls a complete 180 on me wanting to come over and stay the night and get drunk with me. She implies extremely heavily that she wants sex. Now this has come at a bad time due to J suddenly becoming super attached. Now you're thinking ""well why not just tell J you're not interested in her like that and have sex with T""? Well...here's where it gets complicated. About a week ago this extremely hot girl messages me on Facebook... Lets call her M. M makes it very clear that she's interested in hanging out with me and hooking up, the whole nine yards. Cool. I tell her that I'm a bit busy with this other girl at the moment and she says that's fine. Let her know when I'm free. Okey dokey. Now here's where I fucked up. J and T both didn't talk to me for a few days, so I figured ""Hey, why not message M?"" Everything went well at first. She gave me her number and we made plans to hang out in a few days. Cool. Now here's where M. Night Shyamalan decided to direct my life and fuck me over. Wake up today with texts from all 3 girls, saying they're all at the beach. Okay...ask one of them who she's there with. She says the 2 other girls. Oh. My. Fucking. God. Turns out M and T are best friends and I didn't know it...and J was best friends with M and T too at one point...but hadnt talked to them in a while. So what did they do? They all decided to go to the beach together today to catch up. Now all 3 girls I've been talking to are all together. At the beach. Talking about everything. And all they have to do is mention my name once and shits all gonna cave in. I feel like I'm in some stupid highly school drama movie...but it's real...and happening to me right now. I have no idea what to do. I'll post updates if there's any interest on how this plays out. 

UPDATE!!!: I got away with it. Holy shit I got away with it. T texted me all day saying that J talked me up to her and M about me all day. Apparently J sat there talking me up all day, saying how good I was at sex, and how she's stoked that she had a thing with me. T told me that she knows I like her more than J, and that she can't wait to see if what J says is true, and that she wants to come stay the night ASAP(tonight wont work because H is coming over but that's another story). As for J, T said she didn't even know me so J doesn't give a fuck. It's like it never happened to her. M is still very interested and it doesn't seem to have bad any effect on her either. If anything, I came out ahead with T because of all the stuff J said. I'm so lucky. I don't know how this happened. Holy shit. Also been getting a lot of questions about me: I'm an 18 year old male who somehow is getting lucky as shit. Thank you guys all for the support! I really like answering your questions haha.

So the lack of use thing really got my attention. I'm married and have been for 15 years. Our sex life has always been below average. It's great when it happens but she only wants it when she wants it.

I went home and told her about my issue and about the good diagnosis. She was happy, of course, that I was healthy. I emphasized the ""lack of use"" thing several times. She went to bed without even a flirt. No hint what so ever about maybe something out of sympathy at least. We have talked about the lack of sex many times and it never changes anything.

I sat down and wrote this out two days ago but chickened out of posting it under my main Reddit handle. I've read it back to myself over and over again, just to be sure that I'm not being a calloused bitch. The more I read it, the more upset I feel. Not just with my fiance and his kids, but with myself for feeling this way. 

I'm engaged to a man with three teenaged boys, and I hate them with all of my heart. When we go to our first premarital counseling session on Tuesday I'm going to tell him that if he doesn't distance himself from them emotionally, the wedding is off and it's over between us. 

To provide some background, my fiance is a widower. His wife died 11 years ago and he's been raising his kids all by himself. We started dating about 5 years ago when everything you're about to read below might have sounded cute. He proposed to me in September, and I love him with all of my heart. I moved in a month later and my life had been a living hell ever since. 

I honestly can't imagine not having him by my side every day. But his relationship with his kids is fucking neurotic. I'm not exaggerating, and I think I've reached my breaking point. I feel like I want to send all three of them off to boarding school so that they'll be out of my life. I feel like a monster for feeling this way, but I find his relationship with them to be unbearable. 

The youngest is 13 and tries to be a loveable kid, but he just annoys me to the point that I want to leave the room when he's around. His dad treats him like he's two years old, and the kid eats it up. My fiance cuts up his food, will tie his shoes if he's asked, practically dresses the boy in the morning and reminds him when to go to the bathroom. I'm not talking about at night. I mean during the day, he tells him when to go to the fucking bathroom. Just as bad, the kid won't sleep in his own bed half of the time and my fiance randomly picks him up and carries him around like he's a baby. 

Sadly, that isn’t where it ends. Because his 15 year old is almost as bad as the 13 year old. He's not as needy as either of his brothers, but all he has to do is pretend that his feelings are hurt and my fiance automatically gives him anything he wants. He has this line he pulls out about nobody caring about him because he's the middle child. Hearing him say that makes my fiance feel like shit and causes him to give in to whatever it is the kid is asking for. The kid doesn't have to throw a fit or be rude, because as soon as he gets that hurt look on his face, his dad caves. 

On New Years Eve he wanted $200 to go to the mall and his dad gave it to him because it was “easier that way.” I just about hit the fucking roof but I kept my mouth shut for the sake of peace. When he doesn't get his way, he completely withdraws and goes into a separate room of the house to sit by himself until someone throws him a pity party.

The oldest might be the most damaged of the three. He just turned 18 and can't make a decision without asking his dad first. Before I met him, I'd never seen an 18 year old ask for permission to be online or watch TV in their room before bedtime, but this boy does. His dad coddles him just as much as he does the 13 year old, but in different ways. He likes to come downstairs every morning and hang on his dad. They cook breakfast together and the entire time, he's hugging on his dad and telling him he loves him. I think it's okay to love your dad, but the degree to which he does it is just creepy. 

The other day we were talking alone about which college he wants to attend next year, and he plainly told me that “My dad said I'm going to cooking school.” It wasn't his decision, and he doesn't act passionate about it. But this boy seeks permission for everything he does.  

The four of them have a night time routine where they all sit in a giant cluster on the couch and talk about their day. This is the point in the day where the boys talk about their feelings and their dad dotes all over them. They hug, they pray and they go on about their day. In the meanwhile, I have to suppress my gag reflex until it's over and they go upstairs to their rooms. 

I hit my breaking point over Christmas break. The 13 year old and the 18 year old had the flu and it was like life stopped in the house for two days. Instead of keeping them in their rooms where the germs would be contained, he made them both beds on the sectional in the family room, effectively driving me to our room. Then he wouldn't leave them alone for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time, checking their temperatures and tending to them so much that they started to get annoyed with it. At some point he decided that they should sleep in their own beds after all, so he goes downstairs and carries the 13 year old to his bed. 

Okay, not the end of the world.

Then he goes back downstairs and comes upstairs with the fucking 18 year old slung over his fucking shoulder. I had to blink because I couldn't fucking believe what I was seeing. He sets the kid down in front of the bathroom and tells him, “Go potty buddy, then come to your room and daddy will tuck you in.”

The fucking kid is 5'8 and probably weighs 150 pounds! I swear to God it was all I could do to keep my composure and not walk out on him. I know he loves his boys, and he's had to be their mother as well as their father, but come on! He admits that he has a hard time not being over protective of them, but this is too much. When I told him that I made an appointment for us to go to premarital counseling, he got upset and demanded to know why. I just told him that we have some things that we need to talk about before we get married in July. He's fiercely protective over his boys and I'm afraid that things aren't going to end well. 


Tl;dr My fiance smothers kids; I hate their guts and want them to move to Russia.

First of all thanks SO much to you guys' comments and support, it really meant a lot to us and helped make me realize I needed to do something. I'm not sure if updates in here are acceptable but I think you guys deserve an update. 

Alright, so a few days ago I was talking to Hayley on the phone at work about my brother (who has stated he wants to remain anon so for the purposes of non repitition and avoiding the pronoun rape angel I shall call him Charlie), when my boss heard. Needless to say the guy's been like a dad to me since my real dad died and he was pissed and demanded he be there when I talked to Charlie. 

Last night I organized Hayley to take my mother for a relaxing dinner and movie and then gently explain to her what was happening that night with me and her son. 

Meanwhile, after work me and my boss went into my apartment and sat down with him for a serious chat. Charlie looked smug but didn't touch me when he noticed how pissed my boss was. 

I produced to him the terms and conditions for him living under our roof. They were nonnegotiable until a two week trial period had expired and Hayls and I looked over the rules and his behavior etc etc. Charlie said he didn't want my boss here because it was embarrassing because I was treating him like a kid. I said that he was the reason my boss was here because of his behavior, not mine. 

The rules went like this (btw I'm typing this on my iPhone so PC formatting may be weird) 
•Charlie will either take the part-time job offered to him by my boss at his cousin's work or find a job on his own, either way he will be employed by the 29th of July. 
•Charlie does not have to attend university if he doesn't want to, but he will remain employed if he chooses not to apply
•Charlie's gaming hours will be condensed to 4 hours a day with the exception of birthdays and Christmas 
•Charlie will pay $50 rent a week to us. If he doesn't pay up within two days after the due payment day his console will be taken off him until he coughs up the cash
•Charlie will recognize that he does not pay equal share to the apartment and that Hayley and I will have the final word over the conditions and whether he's met them. He is also not to physically or verbally abuse us unless he wants to have his ass bruised by our door. 

I was firm and to the point, not listening to his objections about clan games. I said after two weeks Hayls and I would sit down and think about the rules and whether we would be too harsh or too light and new rules needed to be introduced. I also made it very clear that if his violates any of the terms, plays over four hours a day for three days straight or falls over $200 in debt he's gone. I don't even want him in the house to begin with but the brat doesn't have anywhere to go and I refuse to let him give my mother a heart attack with him living with her again, though I didn't bring this up to him. He started to have a tantrum and left for his room, where he spent all last night.

I've been keeping her for weeks at a time this summer to save my mother the cost of daycare. I've of course always known that she was a little different in the ways that she has done things, but after being her sole caretaker during these weeks I've been wondering more and more if she might be on the spectrum to some degree. 

* She has issues with understanding body language or facial expressions. 
* Can't complete simple tasks without very specific step by step instructions. Like you could ask her to go get something from a vehicle and she will just stare at you. You have to tell her to go outside, get in the car, grab said object, close the door, and bring object back to you.
* Asks permission to do things like use the restroom and to turn on a light. She has always done this, even after repeated conversations with her parents that she doesn't have to ask to do these things. The first day she was here she didn't use the restroom till I could visually see she was uncomfortable and asked her what was wrong. Which is when she asked to use the restroom. This wasn't the first time she has been to my home. She knows where our bathroom is, so I know it wasn't her needing to know where the bathroom was at.
* She becomes visibly upset if something isn't done exactly the way she was taught. You constantly have to remind her that there are many different ways to accomplish the same tasks.
* Our grandpa died last year who she was close with and she showed close to no emotion about his passing. She cried once at his funeral, but everyone commented about how she seemed to do so only because she thought she had to.
* To be blunt, she seems to lack an common sense. 

These are just a few of the things that are off about how she is. She's very bright. Is an amazing artist. Her artistic ability for her age is just beyond amazing. I just worry about her. There have been passing moments where I have wondered if she was left on her own if she wouldn't turn on a light if she couldn't see. If she wouldn't use the restroom without permission, or any numerous little common things people do without being told. 

Of course my parents know she has all of these issues, but they just deal the best they can. I on the other hand wonder if there are resources to help her, even if she isn't on the spectrum. How should I bring this up? Or should I just leave it alone? I see her struggling, I see my parents struggling. Just seems like it would be worth talking to a professional. Man, I feel so lost on what I should do.

EDIT: Sorry if this is hard to read or understand. I'm running off of an hour of sleep. Thanks for reading if you made it through.


**UPDATE:**

I spoke with my parents, and just like I expected, they want to drag it out. My mother's exact words were, ""let's just wait and see if she develops any more problems."" I'm so frustrated. You can tell my sister is struggling, and when she has trouble understanding things they don't know how to handle it in a decent manner.

Everyone expects me to be cool with it since I have brown skin and African American features (i'm mixed.) It also seems time and time again that I keep on getting comments from these customers that I speak too white or that I'm not hood enough.

I've been with my wife, Katie, for three years, been married for just over one. I love my wife dearly. She's beautiful, supportive, and has a great career. We have our ups and downs, like any couple, but I'm very happy I have her in my life. Our biggest problem is communication. She has a lot of anxiety issues and takes them out on me in the form of anger and yelling. She recently started medication and is doing worlds better. All this to say, our biggest problem is slowly starting to get behind us, and we are overall happily married.

When I first met my Katie's sister, Sara, I found her attractive instantly. Sara and I became fast friends. Where Katie and I differed on a lot of topics and have somewhat of a gap in common interests, Sara and I were almost a perfect fit. We both have a passion for music, can discuss religion and politics for hours on end having some great conversations, and even when we disagree on something (which is rare) we still stay friendly and have a good time. We enjoy playing video games, have the same since of humor, enjoy same type of TV shows and movies.... yadda yadda yadda, you get the idea. Perfect fit for a friendship.

Well as time went on, I would often find that I would be just as excited to see Sara as I would Katie (then girlfriend) when I would go over to visit. They both still lived at home with their parents, so Sara would be there all the time too. There were times if I knew Sara wasn't around, I would skip going over all together.

I don't know exactly how or what started it, but I do remember the first time I realized I wanted to actually have sex with Sara. I was over visiting Katie late one night when I got out of my night classes. Sara's boyfriend was over visiting as well. It was late, probably close to midnight. I was lying in bed with Katie who was long since asleep, and myself just waking up from falling asleep as well. I was waiting to find the energy to get up and go home when I heard the moans of Sara from the other room. Her and her boyfriend were going at it like crazy, and I listened to her moaning and screaming for minutes until she hit orgasm. I was insanely aroused.

So for years now I've been attracted to Sara. I fantasize about her constantly. I've run through a million scenarios in my head, and the thing is, while I know it would never actually happen because I'm 100% she doesn't feel the same way at all, If the situation ever came up to sleep with her, I know I would. If we were hanging out and she hinted at making a move, I would chase it. If I got a text out of the blue at 1:00am in the morning to come over to her house because her place, I wouldn't think twice. Sleeping with her is something I've wanted for so long I know that, in the heat of the moment, I could never turn it down.

The thing of it is, it's not that I'm a person who I thought was capable of cheating on my wife, least of all with her own sister. It's not all just about physical attraction. Our general interests, her personality, her body, our shared sense of humor, our passions in music, our thoughts on the world, I'm attracted to almost everything about her. So much so that sometimes I wonder if I'm in love with her. Sometimes I wonder if I would have actually been better off if I ended up with Sara instead of my wife. 

Like I said, I love my wife dearly, and I hope we will be together for the rest of our lives. If anything ever happened to her, or if I ever lost her, I would just be devastated. I'm devoted to her and always try to be a great and supportive husband. But the fact remains I have an undeniable attraction to her sister, and would give almost anything for a chance to be with her. Could be love, could be just lust... could be both. I don't know.

I don't know what to make of all this. Part of me tries to justify it and say it's okay because we can't help who we are attracted to, even if it is my wife's sister. But the other part of me is ashamed of myself, because I know given the chance I'd probably cheat on my wife... with her sister.

I'm not a good guy...

TL;DR - Love my wife, but also very attracted to her sister. Great friends, ton in common, beautiful person and personality. Given the chance... I'd probably sleep with her.

I just have to come out and say it. Maybe someone that has been in my position will read this and offer some advice. But I am mainly doing this to get it off my chest and maybe get some advice. I have no one else to talk to, so here goes. 

I grew up in a conservative, Christian household. I was very involved in my church. From a young age I was warned about the dangers of fornication. It was repeatedly beat into my head that I should not date until I was ready to be married. I had to finish school first, mature, etc. I'm sure this is not uncommon in the South. 

I never dated in high school. My one and only relationship was as a 19 year old during my second year of college. I always felt uncomfortable about it because we attended the same Church, and I knew the elders didn't approve. After nine tumultuous months I broke it off. We fooled around but never had sex. 

Since then I have attracted a few attractive girls, but as soon as I decided to go for it, I would find a way to sabotage the relationship by running away. Relationships make me feel panicked and uneasy. None lasted more than a few weeks. Now I find myself unwilling to even entertain the idea of being in a relationship. I have had first hand experiences of bad relationships through my friends and family. I always thought God would arrange for me to have a wife, but I gave up that fantasy a long time ago. We make our own luck. We control our own destiny. The way we think our lives will play out is rarely accurate. 

The main problem is I still have the same sexual urges as all men my age. I am by no means asexual. I just can't bring myself to fornicate, but at the same time I don't want to be in a relationship. Or probably I just don't know how to be in a relationship. Over the years I have turned increasingly inward, cutting myself off from everyone emotionally. I spend 99% of my free time alone. I have friends, but I never hang out with them. I see my family sparingly. People miss me and enjoy being around me. Like I said before, I am able to attract women with my easy going nature. I come off as confident because I am never trying to hit on girls to get their number. Women pick up on this, and it attracts them. So I could get a girl, I just dont want to. But I do. But I really dont. Fucking shit. 

I feel like my life is passing me by, and I have no way to control how I feel. I know I am on the wrong path, but I am incapable of feeling things that I just don't feel. 

Eventually I will lose my hair and my looks. I'll end up all alone because I never learned how to coexist with a mate. Most days my situation doesn't bother me. I am not depressed. I have goals. I eat well and no longer drink or smoke anything. I'm just empty. I feel like I am wasting my life sometimes and it scares me. My uncle never dated much. I am very much like him. He died alone in his apartment after falling down the stairs and breaking his neck. He laid there rotting for three days before anyone even noticed he was dead. The neighbor called the property manager because of a strange smell emanating from his apartment. I don't want that to be me. 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you took the time to read the wall of text.

Edit: I think part of the problem is that I've grown up without the lifestyle of being in a relationship. I don't know how to do it.

As I was flicking through to find some images I had saved, I found lots of CP, and even incest stuff. Some of the stuff I saw was pretty violent, and lots included rape. I was immediately disgusted and just turned the computer off. I've never told him I've seen these, or anyone else. I am disgusted by him now. I've caught him looking at me inappropriately etc. I'm slightly scared of him. When we were younger - to my protest - he used to put his hands up my leg as 'a game'. It may be an irrational fear, but I'm scared he'll do something to me now. The looks (not the way a brother is supposed to look at you) are getting more frequent. I'm constantly scared he'll do something, or do something to a child. I don't want to tell anyone, as I know he could go to jail for having them, but I'm scared if I don't, one day he might do something. 

As a result of this, I feel like I can't be around him. I cover up as much as I can around him. I know he probably doesn't see this as wrong or whatever, but I am just disgusted by him.

Invariably, we'd start looking at porn, and one night, as we were watching another 10 second clip (gotta love dial-up) of a girl sucking off a guy by a fireplace, I blurted out ""I wonder what it feels like to suck a dick.""

My brother was pretty shocked by what I'd said, questioning my sexuality (I had a gf at the time, too). I very briefly explained the concept of bi-sexuality, and there was a moments silence, after which he said ""Was that meant as an offer?""

After asking him to make sure he was ""clean"", I proceeded to suck him off. I'd asked him to warn me before coming, as I didn't want him to come in my mouth, and he did. Warned me, I stopped, he jerked a bit but apparently lost a bit of wind. He said I could go on if I wanted to, and I did until he warned me again, and he finished himself off.

After the fact I've been mixed about it. Sometimes regretting it direly. Other times just regretting that I didn't let him come in my mouth.

This continued for a while until one day I couldn't resist the urge to have sex with her.  

I lubed up my dick with vaseline and cleaned and lubed her butthole.  I had her bending over the bend as I stood there and slowly shoved my dick into her.  She resisted a bit at first but then she just let it happen, didn't even squeal or anything.  I fucked her for about 20 seconds until I came inside of her.  Afterwards I felt absolutely horrible.  I eventually let her outside and watched her take a shit.

I have never told anyone this and I feel so fucked up for doing it.  I was just a stupid horny kid that didn't know the first thing about women.

My sister and I have been having sex (both of us are female) since we were eleven. It started innocently enough and moved into something more over the years. We both had boyfriends in high school and, once we were both sexually active in hetero relationships, we began letting the boys join us. Once we left for different colleges in separate states we only saw each other a couple of times a year.    
I came out to my parents as a lesbian but not about my sister. She is married now with three kids of her own. I have never loved someone the way that I love her. I dated boys in high school, then a few girls in college. I didn't have a long-term relationship until my senior year of college. We were together for a year. I have only had three LT relationships... I am 29. I told my sister, once, that I love her like a life-partner/SO. She said she knew.    
That was it.   
I usually stay at a hotel when I visit the fam. with the excuse that W and her husband and kids can stay in the house with the grand-parents. W will say she is meeting me to see a movie or to go shopping. Some of it is true. We go on dates, get coffee and dinner or a movie. We go back to my room and we will model clothing while drinking wine. These are the best nights of my life. - I have tried the same things with others but they just are not her. We never exchange ""I love you"" or talk about relationships anymore. There is not end in sight for this - and I don't really want one. That doesn't mean I am not still ashamed of this... 

**Update** I got a text from her about an hour after I uploaded this with a restaurant and a time. They are already at our parent's place for the holiday, I won't be in until the 23rd (tonight, now, for me). I want to bring some of this up - but I doubt I will. I want to thank everyone on here... these were not the responses I expected and actually feel a little better about myself and my/our decisions. Thank you! 

**BIG UPDATE 25/12/12**    
We had a date on the 23rd. It was, as always, magical. I told her how I felt and really made her have the conversation. We both agree that it would be in our best interests to stop the relationship.    
After a few bottles of wine and a good night - we agreed that I will be moving in with them until i can find a place and a job in their city. We decided yesterday morning that our relationship will not end and will be taken to the next step. We may even tell her husband. If I have to have a 3-way for him to be okay with it... I will. I am that desperate and selfish. As of today - our plans are still going strong. It may fall apart in a week.. but I am hoping for the best.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1356477679.0,,,True,t3_15atso,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15atso/confessionprofession_been_in_a_secret_lesbian/,

No woman had ever turned my on that much, and she, let's call her Michelle, did it just by existing. I shamed-spanked that night, partially feeling guilty, but mostly glad that someone like walked this earth. It made me hopeful. 

They got married 2 years later. She still endlessly aroused me but I could control it much better. At one point I had a job offer where they lived (a couple hours north) but turned it down because I didn't trust myself around her. She never flirted or acted inappropriately but I spent every minute in her presence fighting the urge to stare. Or worse touch. 

They got divorced last year. I tried to be there for my brother, took him camping. I should say here, I love my bro. We're two years apart, grew up best friends. I would do anything for him, but he's a flawed guy. Even from his side I could tell he had mistreated her, and she left him. The guilt got bigger as I found myself happy she was single. He quickly started dating the girl she had caught him sexting with. 

I considered contacting her but knew it was wrong and didn't. I focused on my life, softball and work. I dated a girl for a bit, but ended it when I realized I was just passing time with her. I started regularly masturbating to Michelle's facebook pictures. I creeped on her page constantly, and would get ridiculously happy when she 'liked' my post. I battled myself with urges to contact her. I loved how she handled her divorce with grace and dignity. I loved how she never posing for pictures and seems to be laughing in every single one. I love her body, her hair, her voice, she smile, she hands, everything about her. She's wonderful and sexy and kind. She volunteers and collects salt &amp; pepper shakers. She makes band posters and album art. She is the coolest person. I agree with her politics and she always seems to be reading what I'm reading. 

And here's where I become even creepier.

She mentioned something about OKCupid once. I made a fake profile and found her. I started creeping her OKC page as much as her fb. It made me love her more. And one night, I messaged her. It was so great to say the things I always wanted to say to her. Of course, it was probably too much and she blocked me. 

I made another profile and took it easier. She wrote back! We started talking! I lived to hear from her, to read her words for me. Within a week we were talking every night. We switched to email. I'm ashamed I used fake pictures, but I certainly couldn't use my own.

It lasted two months, the two best months of my life. We were sexual, we were loving, it was everything I ever wanted. But, I finally realized that I was being a jerk and told her I lied about what I looked like and told her good-bye. She's such an angel she tried to give 'me' another chance after that.

I'm trying to get a transfer to another country. I deleted my fb and every connection I had to her. I love her, but I mistreated her and could never actually be with her so I needed to stop it. I feel empty and alone now, but I had no other healthy choice. So, reddit confession, that's my wrong-doing. I'm an obsessed creeper.

Either way, I *wanted* to do good and be a better person.  I am really excentric and it started my teacher would ask me, I thought as a joke ""hey you tweek don't you?  I know you're tweeking"" I would say I didn't.

Don't hog it all""  A little more seriously a week later, she would ask me to get it for her.  Finally one day she came in and handed me $150 and told her to get her some.  I was honestly just a dumb kid and had never done anything like that but had connections just by nature of the place I lived.  That first night I got the dope and I cried because I had always told myself I wouldn't do stupid shit like that and I didn't want to end up in jail like my friends


Finally I started getting dope for the faculty there because they would pay me twice as much.  I got really addicted to the money.  That teacher eventually started spreading rumors about me that I was cutting the dope with impurities.  I eventually had to leave over threats.


Fuck all that noise.  That school had so many shit teachers.  They wonder why none of us had good role models.  I'm not blaming my actions on anyone, but when I was there and 16, I can't express how *desperate* I was for a positive influence in my life, and I thought I could look up to my teachers because there was no one in my life even close to a good influence.

We met at a group club we both were a part of. At first we hit it off but she was still a tad bit withdrawn. She had moved to the city I was living at a year before and was having a hard time getting a job in her field. I helped her out and she moved in with me after about 6 months. Things went ok until my work laid people off due to the recession. I was spared until she did a few things in front of my boss that pissed him off off which indirectly (or maybe directly) lead to me being fired after working there for 8 years as the head of their regional office.

The city we lived in was hit hard by the recession so finding work was difficult. She has a house on the other side of the country and we decided to move out there to look for work and so that she could be near her mother who had terminal cancer.

I found a great paying job after only a month and started working with a great bunch of people. She became less and less affectionate and more withdrawn and spent the entire day on the couch or sleeping.

She had been an occasional weed user for years and I never really had much an issue with it since she used it for some chronic illnesses and that was ok with me. I never used it and it didn't seem to bother her.

After we moved to her house, she started using more than what I would call moderate use. She was high from the time she woke up until she went to bed. She convinced me to let her start growing a small amount after I complained how I felt uncomfortable with her buying.

This went for about 10 months and I just let it happen because I didn't want to make an issue about it.

Well to make a long story short, we are now facing some serious legal issues over her habit and I have paid a horrible price for allowing her to do this. I have lost my job, my health has suffered due to the stress, my savings has long dried up and I have started to have chest pains due to the stress. I have no insurance and I am terrified of having a heart attack. 

I'm on unemployment and that barely covers our bills and food. She does nothing to help out or even try to get a job and sleeps 18-20 hours a day. The slightest mention of what we are going through or anything that might stress her out sends her into a  rage. 

I have nobody to go blow off steam with as I can't afford the gas to even go anywhere.

Before I met her I had a very high paying job, a decent savings, and no debt. Now I am thousands of dollars in debt and in collections because I can no longer afford to pay my obligations and I have wasted tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees to try and take care of this issue. She does nothing to help with our legal issues and just says ""I don't know, quit asking me"" every time I try and have a discussion with her.

I am not an aggressive person and do my best to just go along with people but lately when I see her asleep on the couch I want to strangle the life out of her. I think the only thing that stops me is I am terrified of prison and don't want to have my life ruined worse than it already has.


I blame her for the situation we are in and even though I can't bring myself to tell her, She constantly brings up how she feels like I blame her for our situation (I do but I don't say it).

I have no car and my house is 2000 miles away and I have no way to get back. I hate her and want to leave her but she has the house and the cars and I feel stuck with someone that has sucked me dry and has caused me to lose everything I have worked for.

It oftentimes appeared as a sign of weakness.  I never used to cry.  When I was a young child, I was abused by my former stepfather.  He would beat me with any object he could find.  We're talking beatings until I bled.  His sole mission was to make my cry with the beatings and I would resist until I could no longer bear the pain and would cry out in agony.

As a young teenager, due to the destruction of my family, I was adopted by a man and his wife.  They were White and loved me unconditionally.  Their son had been struck by lightening and killed in their front yard and they adopted a child after his death, but he was grown, married, and had a life of his own.

They were older but they taught me about life.  They taught me about work, responsibility, love, the need for education, and how to be successful in life.

I joined the military and then moved on to the civilian world.  My adoptive Mom passed away in 1984 and while it was painful, it wasn't devastating.  She had been sick for awhile and she smoked heavily so she passed away at 67 years of age.

My Dad, lived to be 92.  He died on Christmas Eve in 2010.  

I was shattered.  I think of him every single day.  I miss him terribly.  Our conversations.  Our time together.  Our discussions on family, politics, or just reminiscing about our lives.  I miss him.

And ever since he passed, I've cried.  Lots.  Things that never could move me, now move me.  I see my daughter and how well she's turned out and I tear up.  I see movies and I tear up.  I see YouTube videos about soldiers coming home from war to their Mom's and Dad's and I tear up.  

I'm kind of embarrassed by it.   I never was this way before.  But I guess it's just a maturing process.  I'll be 50 soon.  I don't want to be the old guy with the handkerchief but I just might turn out to be that guy.

That is as detailed as that's getting.



Our parents announced their separation in 1999, and divorced in 2000.  After they told us about the separation, we were confused and sought each other out for comfort.  I was just starting to hit puberty and had my first erection.  My brother and I slept in the same room, and he convinces me to allow him to show me how to masturbate.  



That was my first orgasm.  



I had no idea what was going on at the time, I didn't even know that masturbation existed.  This developed over time to him telling me it was my turn to masturbate him and after a few months, we were both jerking each other off almost every night.  Until the night he decided to take it one step further.  



He told me that if I put my mouth on his penis and sucked on it, that it would be even better than ever.  He told me that if I did it to him he'd do it to me.  I still had no idea what I was doing, mind you.  



This was my older brother.  I trusted him absolutely, and never thought that he would tell me to do something that I wouldn't want to do, or that might be ""wrong"".



So we progressed to blowjobs.  This kept on until I was in my early teen years.  By that time we had experimented with anal (neither of us accomplished said feat), but mostly it was blowjobs.  



It was around my mid teen years when I finally admitted what I had been feeling for a long time.  That this was wrong, that I didn't want this, that I was disgusted with myself and that I hated him for doing this to me at such a young age.



I do not hate gays, by the way.  I have nothing against them.  But I was a young boy, and I had no clue what I was doing.  Also, I am completely straight.  Yes, I have looked inward to see if I had any bi in me.  There isn't any there.  Trust me.  So this disgusted me because A)  I was so young, B) he was taking advantage of me, C) I was a straight boy performing sexual acts on his older brother.



As I said, when my mid teen years hit, I matured quickly and became very popular with girls my age.  I began dating.  I quickly found out about vaginas and boobs and...let's just say, it was quite wonderful.  



He was not happy about this, however.  He is a straight male too, by the way.  But he was not happy that I wouldn't do what he told me to do anymore.  He had always been bigger than me and able to overpower me whenever we argued.  But not anymore.  Whereas he was lanky and quite thin, I filled out quickly and played football and I wrestled.  



Finally, one day, he tried to force himself on me.  He was used to being the stronger one.  I lifted him off me, and threw him through his bedroom door.  I told him that if he ever touched me again like that I would send him to the hospital.



We have not spoken about about it since.  I have never told a soul.  I have never sought therapy or comfort.  I am very capable of healthy relationships and have a girlfriend currently.  I'm quite happy with her.



Currently, I am actually staying with him as he hit a rough patch in his life and was contemplating suicide.  My mother pleaded with me to help him so I dropped everything in my life to come and help my family.  I will be moving back in fall.  



As we have never spoken about it, I have never gotten the chance to tell him.  I will never forgive him for what he did to me.  I do not hate him.  But I will not forgive him.

The child that was born out of this whole fiasco, I love dearly and always will. Today is his first birthday. Honestly I couldn't be happier but I feel like shit because my intentions in the beginning were entirely malicious. This guy lives far away, across the country. My wife has always struggled with mental illness and after a trip to jail in 2011 she really lost it. She started drinking a lot and eventually had this random guy from 1000 miles away contact her on Facebook. I found out pretty early on and kicked her out, they hadn't met yet. Well she latched on to this guy pretty hard and ended up meeting up with him and ended up pregnant. He didnt know right away though. Meanwhile I had custody of the kids and tried to keep everything decent for them. The guy made this whole thing seem like a game, a conquest, to steal away a married woman. She decided that she wanted to end things with him and try to get her family back but the pregnancy was obviously an issue. He was ok with abortion/adoption because he didn't want a child right now and because it 'was her body'. She was going to give the baby up for adoption so our family could move on from this. The adoption issue got a bit complicated since we were still legally married, she started talking about keeping the baby and I feigned supportiveness because I felt like this would be the ultimate revenge. I didn't have good intentions. Plus there was a very small chance it could've been mine. 

So we keep the baby. It's clearly not mine. She contacts the bio dad and tells him she kept the baby and gave him the chance to step up. He didn't. I signed the birth certificate, and that's a wrap. 

I felt horrible afterwards but I do have a big heart and love my children and felt that I could at least play nice with the new baby.

Well I fell in love and he is a great addition to our family. But I feel bad about how I looked at the situation in the beginning. Today he turned one and I was looking back on the whole situation and how much of a mess it was compared to today. My wife and I are doing better. She's on meds and has stayed on them. I feel happy. That feeling of anger and vengefulness still kinda haunts me though.

I've been wondering if I should post this at all, considering the amount of Americans here, so if you think my confession might offend you, then please move on.
 
Anyway, for the last couple of days all I've been seeing is posts about the bombing and the following manhunt. However, I don't have any sympathy for the victims or Bostonians in general. For the last couple of years the U.S has been obsessed with terrorism to the point where it's getting ridiculous. This has resulted in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the TSA, all kinds of espionage, and drone strikes in the Middle-East. Now there's been an attack on American soil, and suddenly everyone is upset. However, the same things have been happening in the Middle-East nearly every day. On the same day as the bombing in Boston 30 people were killed in Baghdad. No-one cared. The U.S' drone strikes have killed over 2500 people, of which at least 150 were children, yet no-one seems to give a shit. I almost that  what happened in Boston was a form of karmic retribution.

I know I'm supposed to think it's terrible, but the way everyone seems to deeply care for the victims is just ridiculous in my eyes. Suddenly the attacks are top priority, even though they killed just 3 people. Everyone on Reddit is karma-whoring posts of the supposedly 'heroic' Boston PD, even though they were going house to house, conducting searches like it's 1984 revisited. Some assholes even pinned the bombing to a completely innocent person. The U.S has been committing morally ambiguous, if not downright evil acts around the world, and now that someone strikes back it's suddenly the worst thing since Hitler. There's just this huge circlejerk of 'this is the end of the world' and 'look at all those policemen and first responders, faith in humanity restored' and everyone seems to be participating, and I'm standing here, thinking 'Why am I the only one who doesn't care?'

When I was six I was taken to a basement by a 'popular' older member of a religious school. Over the course of around 30 minutes I was raped, it never dawned on me what was occurring, and I never told anyone(I remember being scared I would get into trouble.)

Only recently have I felt I need to do something about it, after thinking about it and watching the film 'Sleepers' . I'm happily married with two amazing kids, and an amazing wife, a great well paying job but I don't have the heart to tell her...... 

Ever since the abuse I've been replaying the scene in my head, and We nearly split up 3 years ago, when she caught me looking at porn(run of the mill stuff, just of oral sex). I'm not blaming the abuse on my interest in porn, I have taken responsibility for that. She is deeply religious and hated me for it, and I nearly fell apart when she threatened to take my children away ,whom I spend every waking minute with and love more than life itself.

I came from a single parent background, father in prison most of my life and now estranged, and a mum who looked after several kids by working 18hr days for 30 years..... I don't think my mum could hear this, she would , knowing her blame herself, and she has been to hell and back over 50 years. Despite this I managed to get myself through University and forge a career as a Director of a large department with a turnover of around £30m, and written a few books all by the age of 32

I still believe in God, and I don't blame him, but I'm not practising at all, and many of my friends are becoming increasingly religious, leaving me isolated to a degree.....not sure how to move forward on this...

I'm a big guy now(6ft 3) and I feel nothing but sheer hatred for the sick bastard that raped me, a weak small 6 year old kid ,I've had thoughts about finding and killing him for what he did, but I always swore I would protect my kids, and not end up putting my son and daughter through a life of growing up without a dad.... but I constantly think I need to come forward and help protect other children in case he is still out there doing it...no matter the cost to my life....

I really don't know what to do, bury this and take it to my grave, or look for help and start counselling.... but I don't think I could ever tell my family and friends, I'm not sure my wife wouldn't leave, and I would rather die than end up just seeing my kids on the weekends, and not be with them every moment I have, its the only thing I feel I have really achieved, is being a good dad, at least I hope I am.

That ""be yourself"" bullshit is bullshit, because if I acted like myself everyone would hate/be afraid of me.  I hate being with other people because I constantly have to impress them, or at least try not to anger them or weird them out.  This feeling is times 100 with girls, especially girls I'm attracted to.

I also don't like being a human.  My whole life I've truly wanted to live like an animal, fending for myself, fighting, fucking, without society having rules for me.  I hate money, I hate government, I pretty much hate how the human race operates.

I will never be able to live like this because people are everywhere.  I'll never be able to live in a wild, carefree environment.

Every time I have these thoughts part of me thinks I am insane, and I should just grow up, make some money, and go on living the way everyone else does, because that's what I'm supposed to do.  But I don't want to be like everyone else, and I dont want to grow up and die being unhappy. 

I've never told anyone this.  I have a lot of friends, who (as far as I know) think I'm perfectly normal and content.  I've never been diagnosed with any sort of depression of mental disorder.  I've never seriously contemplated suicide or anything like that.

Her health has been on the decline, both physically and mentally for some time. By the time I was 14 her memory and general mental health had degraded to the point when she was basically unable to communicate with someone. She would lose track of who she was talking to after only a minute or so of conversation, and she could hardly make a coherent sentence by the time I was like, 15. By that point she couldn't even leave her room without accompanying another person. She was 83.

By the time I'd entered middle school it was clear that there was just no hope of recovery, only a downward spiral until eventually nature took its tole and let her go. By the time I was 14, we were near the end of her having any ability to function, and my mom wanted me to spend time with her. It was important to her that I meet my grandmother while there was anything left to meet. So every Tuesday after school, I had to visit my grandmother. Sometimes my mother would go with me, but usually I would go alone.

Look, I know that this is fucked up. But I want to explain something. I would sit in a room with this elderly lady who couldn't even recognized who I was and would blather on about things that were completely nonsensical. She was senile, and it scared me. It scared me into doing things that I know are wrong. I knew they were wrong at the time. I know that I was really stressed and scared and I guess I just let bad things take me over.

It's hard for me to talk about what I did. I'll try to type it out though. I'm crying now remembering all of this and I feel sick. I literally have a pain that feels like part of me was just taken out. The guilt is horrible. Well, here it goes. She was just sitting in her bed, and I just... I just went for it. I started to feel her breast. I'd never felt one before, and I was just... I just did it. I knew that she couldn't tell anyone and I was curious and scared and I'd slide my hand under her gown and massage her breasts. That's how it started. I was 14. 

It moved on. While she lay in the bed, I'm ashamed to admit it, but at some point I fingered her vagina and sucked on her nipples while I was alone with her. God. I want to vomit. 

This continued until I was 16 when I realized how fucked up this was. At that point she couldn't even talk. She died when I was 17, when she was 85. I had to give a eulogy knowing what I'd done. I cried and dry heaved at the podium and everyone thought it was because I couldn't handle grief but really it was because I thought that I deserved to go instead of her. God. What is wrong with me. I was a messed up kid in a lot of ways. I probably need therapy. But holy shit this was the worst thing that I did. I abused her. How do I fix myself?

Just about every other secret I have, I have told at least one person (not directly involved), except for this one. I haven't even posted it on Reddit yet. But anyways, so I am a straight 20 year old male. I have yet to even kiss a girl. I'm not very outgoing with meeting new girls, and the ones I have talked to in the past, I was never very good of getting past a ""just friends"" level. I'm just not very flirtatious. But, I have a pretty high sex drive (I don't really know if its much higher than your average guy, but point is I think about and want sex quite a lot).   
  
I know the title makes it sounds like I am just denying that I am gay, but to clarify, somewhere arond 95-98% of my sexual fantasies involve girls. I definitely prefer girls in general. I have definitely had gay fantasies before, but not very often at all, and as I've gotten older I have had them less and less. I've watched a decent amount of porn and have never watched gay porn or been interested in watching it. The thing is, I just really like and want to have sex, and so far have been unsuccessful with girls.

So a few years ago. I was in high school, near the end of ninth grade. I was pretty sexually frustrated and at the height of puberty. I was camping in this wooded area near where my friend lived, with that friend. We were smoking weed at the time, which we had only done a few times before. I really wasn't that high though, and I don't think he was either. Basically, he came on to me and asked if we wanted to trade blowjobs. As a sexually frustrated kid who really wanted to know what that felt like, I accepted. I really hated giving it, but receiving it felt very good. I was ashamed for a while about it, but I kind of realized it doesn't matter much. We had one more encounter (he again asked first) a few months later and have hardly ever spoken about it since. He has had many girl friends since then I am pretty sure he is (mostly) straight like me. I feel like if I had a girl during this time, I would not have accepted either time. But, again, I was sexually frustrated.  
  
About a year later I started becoming better friends with a new guy. He eventually admitted that he was gay. Somehow the topic came up and, again being sexually frustrated and remembering how good that blowjob felt earlier, I accepted. I had no romantic feelings for this guy and never have. We had two encounters around that time. Then, this past summer (about 2 years after the first encounter), he asked me if I'd want to do it again. I accepted. We had about four or five of these encounters in total. To be honest, every time it happened, I didn't enjoy it that much, but then afterwards, I'd be craving to do it again. And again, if I had a female sexual partner at the time, I would not have accepted.   
  
My friends aren't necessarily homophobes, but I don't really see them taking this news all that well, so I haven't told anyone (and I live in a very homophobic area in general). As far as I know, neither of the two partners I had have either. Sometimes I look back with regret, sometimes I look back and figure ""hey, no harm done"".  I honestly didn't enjoy the encounters with guy #2 all that much, but my mind said ""hey, its better than no sex"", so I guess that is why I kept going back. Sometimes I really crave it and consider asking him if he'd like to do it again (which he probably would), but the rational part of me knows I will not enjoy it as much as my fantasies seem to make me think.  
  
I don't really have much of a point in all this, it just feels nice to get it off my chest when I've kind of kept it bottled up. I always go back and forth whether I actually regret the encounters or not, the whole thing is really confusing in my head.

Nothing pisses me off more than the arrogance ~~you~~ some fucking pot heads carry around. The ignorance, too. Fucking ridiculous. Maybe if you would stop being so much of a jackass, I may try and support your attempt to legalize it. (Edited for ~~Ihatestrairs~~ ihatestairs.)

Fuck the potheads. 

/Rant.

Edit: This post got more attention than I was expecting. I was only prepared for three comments tbh. 

**I don't mean every pothead does this. I'm ok with the bunch that don't make a big deal of it. I don't mind if you smoke, and I don't even care if you do it in front of me. Just let me be, and don't try to pressure me into it.**

So, a quick backstory, the reason why I don't smoke is because I made a promise with my close cousin before he passed to not smoke anymore. I got into a lot of trouble and we both knew I was throwing my life away. He was 24 when I was 15, and he felt I was following in his footsteps. He OD'd from Oxy later that week. 

I'm currently 16 too, and these people I'm complaining about aren't my friends. I cut all ties with my friends beginning of this year after my cousin passed. Literally all ties. Currently, I don't have too many friends. I keep to myself and generally avoid everyone. I can't go a whole day without hearing a conversation, unfortunately, in high school, so avoiding this isn't possible. I'm a junior, and the trend right now is smoking. I know it's inevitable I'm going to hear it so I might as well just get used to it now. I'm almost numb to it, but when I posted this thread, it was about a year's worth of frustration built up. Edit: I suck at spelling.

**Tldr: Made a promise with my cousin to not smoke, but all the peer pressure to do it is started to get on me. The constant teasing for being a 'straight edge' isn't helping either.

I always knew I was chunky, big boned, hardy, whatever other terms I could use to describe my physical appearance without admitting I was obese.  What bothered me more than my physical appearance, was knowing how unhealthy I was. 

One day after walking up two flights of stairs to get to my office, a blind co-worker asked if I was alright.  I was confused and responded ""yes, why?"" He told me he could hear me breathing heavy and was concerned. I had to confess that I was out of breath because walking up the stairs was difficult for me.  He responded ""oh, I didn't know you were overweight.""  I was crushed and thought that was incredibly insensitive of him.  

I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.  I was mortified, ashamed, embarrassed.  He couldn't see that I no longer fit into my jeans, he couldn't see my discomfort in my office chair, he was oblivious to my physical appearance.  He knew my body was failing me, or I was failing my body and he didn't even have to see me to know it. 

That day everything changed. I got a gym membership that afternoon, asked my friends to support me and lost 100 pounds that year.  I've kept it off for 5 years now and often think of the man who heard my fat. But, after I lost the weight,  while I worked there I made it a point to make him hear me running up the stairs -- without panting or wheezing. Proving to us both that I was no longer out of shape. 

Sometimes you need to hear the things you already know.

Its pretty smooth, I guess she didn't realize how slippery it was and it dropped and shattered into pieces.

It was just a fucking toy, why did I yell at her?

**EDIT**: Just a quick update.  Some people were saying that she didn't apologize enough or something; She did, I basically just summed up what she said in one word. She apologized profusely after it happened, but as I started getting angry and yelled, she froze up and started to cry.  We had a talk today, I picked her up and told her it was stupid of me to blow up like that. She confessed to me that her father was physically and verbally abusive to her growing up, even when she was almost 18. I guess me behaving that way brought back negative memories and she felt flooded with memories of her father yelling at her and add to the fact that she felt really bad about what she had done, she just could not handle being there.

I'm cooking dinner for her tonight and giving her a full body massage with oils (even though I am no expert at massages) I know she loves getting her body rubbed, so tonight she gets the works.

1374109462.0,88,self.confession,1iize6,My coworker's husband just tried something with me. I don't know what to do.,119,31,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1iize6/my_coworkers_husband_just_tried_something_with_me/,"A little back story: My assistant's husband (let's call him John) has disclosed to a number of our circle of friends that he, as a surprise for his wife, had been taking reflexology classes and was planning on getting his certification soon. 

Yesterday I found out I was losing my job. Today at work John (who also works with us) acknowledged my situation and apologized for the shittiness of it. He said that he still had some practice hours to get in before his certification and that I could come by the house later and he could log some minutes. We essentially would be doing each other a favor. 

An hour ago I get to his house, he has me sit on the couch and lay back. He shows me a foot reflexology map: all business, proceeds to explain what he is going to do, and starts putting lotion on my feet. He tells me to get comfortable, put whatever on TV, and that I can put a pillow on my stomach. 

Unfamiliar with reflexology technique, I figure I better do what he says, maybe it will work better. I put the pillow on my stomach. He is blocked from my view. Then it happens. 

My big toe feels like its been dipped in warm butter. I look up and nothing seems to be amiss. Admittedly, I am paranoid about feet and have never had my toe in someone's mouth before. I wasn't sure if anything had actually happened, and without witnessing it myself, I didn't want to throw accusations around, but I think this guy just had my toe between his lips. Even typing this is the most surreal thing I've ever witnessed. 

Not sure if he actually did the thing, I propped myself up on my elbows to discourage any funny business. I have known this guy for years. He adores his wife. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. So eventually the talk continues regarding how the reflexology classes actually works, what the learning is like etc. I lean back again and after a few minutes, it happens again. 

I pop up as fast as I could and see my big toe knuckle deep in his mouth. I jumped off the couch, said ""what the fuck"" and attempted to leave. He begged me for a few minutes to talk, said it was an accident, and said I need to extricate myself from this situation immediately. 

I left, and now I sit, hyperventilating, feeling more violated than I've ever felt in my whole life, and don't know what to do. He's been blowing up my phone ever since. His wife has become a friend of mine in recent months, and I don't want to hurt her. I also don't want her to think I was coming on to him. I am very happily engaged and have never entertained the desire for anything physical with him. I also worry that withholding this information from her would make me look guilty. 

I also don't know if it's even my place to tell her. If this information comes out down the road, I will be humiliated, and her trust will be betrayed. Please help me. 

tl;dr my coworker's husband sucked on my toe tonight. I'm disgusted. What do I do?

How strong? I truly didn't know myself, until the deputies showed up at my house to evict us. I had known she had a problem with Oxycontin after a surgery, but apparently not how deep that addiction went. Perhaps I was deliberately fooling myself. She had two children from a previous marriage that I loved very much, and I couldn't see myself separated from them. I knew she was taking too many pills but I overlooked the problem as long as she made it to work and such. We both had relatively good paying jobs, and lived in the 3 bedroom house I purchased before our marriage. I could see the impact it was having on her however, and especially on the children. I made the decision to take all of her medications away from her, and give her only the amount prescribed by the doctor. I thought if I could manage her habit, she could recover and we could be a family.


I am stupid apparently, because it never occurred to me that she was the one mailing out all of our bill payments. I never figured out that the fact was that she was supplementing her missing pills by buying them from strangers on the street. Looking back, I can't believe how blind I was. We were evicted from my house, and she went to live with her parents, while I went to live with mine. I got two visitations with my step-children, until one asked me ""why aren't you and mommy together""?  I made the mistake of telling him that I thought her medicines make her sicker, rather than better, and when she heard she disallowed visits. There is no law that allows a step-father any rights, no matter the length of his service.

I then made the demand that she attend rehab, or choose divorce, secretly hoping she would choose divorce, and being glad when she chose that.

Here is where I made my mistake. Her children had medical issues that required constant care, and at this point I was the only one working. Instead of divorcing her, I allowed her and her dependents to continue on my insurance. While this allowed for the care of the children, it allowed her to continue her drug habit as well.


I also continued the $500,000 life insurance policy I had on her while we were married, secretly hoping she would make the mistake that would allow me to collect. Fortunately for me, I met the woman of my dreams, and our relationship progressed to the marriage point. I finally had to ask my (ex)wife for a divorce, which she agreed to (after fighting for additional insurance rights which were denied). This also cancelled the life policy.

My (ex)wife died of an overdose a year later, leaving her kids without a mother and with a deadbeat dad. So much time had expired that I didn't attend the funeral as I felt that my attendance would be another stab in the heart for them, rather than a comfort. The worst part is that all I could think about by that time was that if I had just held the life insurance for one more year.....

So, then I just hid the carton in a cupboard, waiting for an opportune time to dump its contents.

More often than not it took me a long time and I could easily have 10 gallons of urine ""stashed away"", before finally actually getting rid of it.

She has been living with me for the last 3 years.  I am 26 years old for information sake.  Her PC in her room is connected into the network I have installed in the house.  I recently installed Windows 8 into her PC and she was complaining about how slow her PC got. A few days ago, I logged into her PC from mine to see what the problem was.  She had a folder on her desktop that was labeled ""Uncle"".  I opened this folder and found **hundreds and hundreds** of hidden camera videos of me in my room undressing, naked, having sex with my girlfriend, masturbating, playing video games, and other various stuff, all in the privacy of my bedroom.  She had all the video in different folder names for what was in the video. I went to my room, and found where she hid the camera.  It was in a HVAC vent in my wall. The vent from her room and my room are apparently very close to each other and she hooked a webcam up in there.  I left the the videos in the folder and did not erase them. I was going to talk to her, but I have not confronted her about it yet.  I think I may never confront her about it.  I would never, never, never, ever ever touch or do anything to her.  She is like my own daughter an I love her unconditionally.  I am just confused on how to handle this situation. Her father disappeared before she was born and her mom, my sister, is in jail for 40 years after she tried to rob a house on a drug high and got caught.  She assaulted a police office during the arrest and was sentenced in court.  My niece went thought a load of shit with her coked up and drugged up mom growing up.  She is the sweetest thing in the world to me and I would do anything for her to make her happy.  I think I will let her have the videos, and never confront her about the camera.  I will just go on living life as is and continue to do what I do in my room normally.  

**Edit Update**  SO I talked to her this past weekend about the situation.  I had copied a few files onto mt PC as proof, and erased all the files from her PC on Friday while she was at school, and disabled the webcam from her PC.  She noticed right away Friday night, but kept quite about it.  On Saturday, during lunch, I brought it up.  She denied it at first, but then quickly realized that she was caught.  I told her I was upset, but not mad.  I told her that I have erased everything and disabled and will be removing the webcam.  I told her that she violated my trust and that she can talk to me about anything, at any time.  She said that she had feelings for me because I watched over her and took good care of her, as she never had a father figure.  I told her that was not right to have feelings for me as her Uncle.  I said to her that she was young and possibly not knowing what is right and wrong.  I told her that this needs to end and if she wants to talk, let me know.  She said she understands and that she was very sorry for what she had done.  We hugged, I told her that she is my life now.  I took her out for ice cream after, and joked to her about the ingenuity that it took to rig up the camera and setup everything.

We had, however, kept the same circle of friends and so we talked from time to time.

Then, finals came, and she was too afraid of her exam, and wanted me to teach her what she couldn't learn in months. She also wanted me to help her write an essay that was worth a lot of points in her class. I also had classes, and a job, a lot to do, and had been in a sort of a dry spell. She had a boyfriend.

* The first is that I'm going to tell this from my own perspective. This is what I experienced, not what probably really happened from a scientific perspective. 

* The second is my background. I have been going in and out of depression most of my adult life. 

* I'm bisexual. I was closeted throughout the entirety of this story. Even now, I don't talk about this part of my life to the majority of my friends, and they accept me for who I am as long as I keep it that way.

* When I get too stressed out, I shut down. I stop talking or moving. If it is bad enough, I got into the fetal position.

I was head over heels in love with a girl named Julie. We had been quietly dating for half a year when I began to get a case of the winter blues. I lost interest in everything and was only happy when I was around her. My poor mood began to get on her nerves, and Julie lost interest in me. She started seeing my roommate behind my back. When one day I found them cuddling together, things finally fell apart. 
  
I was heartbroken. I had been living for her. Now, I had to see her every time she visited my roommate in our one room dorm room. The depression I was in sank lower than I had ever felt before. I tried to forget it all by playing World of Warcraft, and my self therapy actually worked a little. It was enough to make me forget about my problems for a little while.  
  
While I was playing WoW, I happened to meet another player on my server who happened to live in the same city as me. He eventually invited me to join him in person to play. When I met him, we both felt a special bond. We had a great deal in common. Brent was a young, closeted, gay dude who was also seriously depressed. Unlike me, he had a very hard time hiding his sexuality. Although it never became ""Facebook official"" or anything like that, we were in a very close relationship by the end of the month. 
  
Brent's roommates were not people he chose to live with. They were just a bunch of assholes the university decided to throw him with. They gradually began to harass Brent more and more for being gay. He didn't have the backbone to take it. I spent more than one night just being a shoulder for him to cry on. One night in early March, when I was giving him a hug goodnight, he tried to give me his speaker system (mine was crap). I said I couldn't, kissed him on the forehead and left. After I left, he slit his wrists in the shower and bled to death. One of his roommates found him later that night when the water had been running for too long.  
  
I didn't know what to do anymore. His family blamed me for Brent's death. They said I made him gay and wouldn't let me go to the funeral. I still don't know where he is buried. I had nobody to turn to. None of my friends had even met Brent more than once or twice and none of them knew about us. I had no way to explain to them what he meant to me without also outing myself. Needless to say, the next few days were the worst days of my life.  
  
The very next night, I was in shock. I tried to deal with everything by ignoring it. I started playing WoW with a liter bottle of peach schnapps. After I got into an instance, my roommate arrived with his girlfriend and decided that they wanted to cuddle and watch the Dead Poet's Society. Having seen the movie before, I knew about the ending. (SPOILER ALERT: it ends with the fairy boy shooting himself in the head /END SPOILER) I sat through half of the movie before it finally got to me. I left, holding back tears, went outside and punched a brick wall for an hour. When I came back, I had broken most of my knuckles and could barely hold my glass. I didn't sleep that night. All I did was cry.  
  
The very next day, I was playing WoW again. A bunch of people from my hall were congregated outside of my door and a friend came up to us holding a broom. He was visibly drunk. He started prodding me with the broom repeatedly. Then, at one point in the conversation he accused me of, ""batting for the other team."" at the same time as he tried to stick me in the ass with the broom handle. This drove me into a 
rage. I snatched the broom away from him, chased him until I had him cornered and then threw it like a javelin. It hit him square in the chest and he left me alone the rest of the night.  
  
It was the next day when I spoke to Brent's parents over the phone. They told me what they thought of me and why they wouldn't let me go to his funeral.   
  
At that point, I was sick of living. I planned everything out. I wrote a will. On the 15th, I took three ethernet cables twisted together into a rope and made a noose from it. Then, I wandered out into the woods by our campus and found the sturdiest tree branch that was high enough. I jumped up and down on it just to make sure it would hold. Then I tied the noose on it and hung myself so that I was facing into the sunset.  
  
If anyone gets the idea to hang themselves, let me suggest you don't. I didn't position the knot correctly, so the fall did not break my neck. I couldn't breathe and the willpower to try not to struggle only lasted for a minute at most. My lungs felt like they were on fire. I was in pain; so much pain. It was worse than any pain I have ever experienced before. As I dangled there, the seconds stretched into hours and the minutes stretched into days. My vision faded to black after what felt like a millenia.   
  
Then, things started to change. Despite the snow on the ground, I wasn't cold anymore. Even though I was effectively blind, I started to see a white light in the center of my vision. It was a bright light. Brighter than staring directly at the sun, but at the same time it wasn't painful. It was warm and numbing. As I struggled to free my neck, the white light grew brighter and grew. It grew until it surrounded me. When it did, I was no longer in pain. I no longer cared about Julie or Brent or anything that had happened to me. It felt like the white light was an impossible number of souls, all crammed together. I think this might have been God. I didn't have a body anymore. I was also one of these white specks. None of them greeted me. None of them cared that I was there. I didn't care either. I had no emotions at all. I was completely apathetic to everything. I could have been a Jew right next to Hitler and not had a care. At the same time, I had no love or joy. I felt like I had access to all of their collected wisdom (not knowledge, but wisdom). I felt like I could do anything at all if only I cared enough to do so.  
  
Then, it felt like I was kicked and ripped out of there all at the same time. I found myself back in my dying body, hanging from the tree. I wasn't sure that it was even the same person. It felt like someone almost exactly like me, but not quite the same. Then, I died again. This happened again and again for what felt like millions of times all in a few moments. I died and came back and died again. Each time, it felt like a little bit of another me came back with me and then each body felt different from the one before (I was probably having a stroke or something). The last time it happened, the push felt larger than before. I felt like I was blasted back into the dark of a body.  
  
I estimate that I was unconscious for about 20 minutes. When I came to, the branch I had hung myself from was lying on the ground next to me. It had cracked off of the tree. I still don't know how this happened. I collected my things and went back to my room. The rest of the week, I wore hooded clothes and covered my neck so nobody would notice the bruises. To this day, I don't think anybody ever did.  
   
Since that day, I haven't felt like the same person. People have commented that I have a completely different personality now. It feels like there is someone else in my head, working with me. It's not a voice. It's more like a second conscience with more selfish opinions. It is very strong. I also still feel a hint of the apathy I felt when I was in the light (This all could very well be brain damage). I haven't ever been angry enough to raise my voice since. Nothing gets to me anymore. I haven't felt suicidal ever again and immediately turned my life around. I got a job that summer and quit playing WoW. I began to exercise daily and now I am in great shape. I am doing better than I had ever imagined, and all because of what happened that day.  
  
Now, it's been several years and I still think about what happened every day. Until now, I have never shared the whole story with anyone. Thanks for being one of the first.

He hung himself in his apartment that day. I heard her ask what he said to me when he called.

I didn't have the heart to tell her ""your son came to me for help, and I told him to fuck off."" This is where my life's lie has begun. Over 5 long years, and I've told people that I tried to talk him down that night, every single time. I still blame myself for it. After all, just the year before, I had slit my wrist in the summer time. He randomly decided to drop by my house. At that moment. He saw what I had done, and applied pressure to my forearm, buying me time to get to the hospital. 

I still have nerve damage in my hand from the constriction(feeling only, I can move it just fine), but he gave me the gift of life. And how did I repay him? Told him to fuck off in his time of need.

I miss you, brother. We weren't related, but you were my family. I'm sorry I was such an asshole. I'm sorry that I was such a shitty friend. You deserved better than me. I need this out there. Writing this out has helped relieve a little pressure.

This isn't a totally shitty situation... The day he died, I forced myself to be reborn. He was always the kind of kid who was nice to everyone, smiled, even when his life was in the gutters. He did his best to make everyone else happy. I rebuilt myself in his image. Took in all the small life lessons he taught. I try to be a better person. But I still can't help but feel like I've deprived this world of an amazing human being. 

Brother, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to everyone I've lied to. I'm sorry to his mother, his father, and his friends. I'm sorry to everyone who he should have met.",,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_1kfqwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kfqwu/i_know_its_too_late_but_im_sorry/,

I don't know where to begin...I'm trying to keep it short.

I left my home country (Germany) years ago, moved to Canada, now I moved back (to Holland) to be closer to my family...seeing them once a year for 3 weeks just didn't cut it. I have my girlfriend with me, I am healthy, I live in a nice place and I am currently hunting for a job. One could say I am fine. I don't feel like it. I barely sleep, I have nightmares, I am constantly depressed, I can barely get myself to leave the house to go for a walk. Nothing I do (watch a good movie, listen to my favorite music) can cheer me up, in fact, it almost bothers me. I don't care about food, which is weird since I'm an avid hobby cook and I used to love food.

I did see a shrink a while back, I do not have depression. He did give me Prozac, but it made shit worse. 

The thing is, deep down I know I shouldn't feel the way I am feeling, on the outside I have a great life, I am just not feeling it. I don't know what I want to do with my life, I don't know what I want to do work wise, and so on. I am turning 31 this year and I know nothing about what I want to do. I feel like my life is passing me by...like I am just treading waters and wasting time.

Anyways, it feels a bit better to type it all out...thanks for reading, I do appreciate it.

1296070410.0,88,self.confession,f9jb2,I killed my own mother,187,99,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/f9jb2/i_killed_my_own_mother/,"My mother was an evil person, long ago corrupted by some form of mental illness. Beyond the typical ""annoying mom"" stuff, she had a cruel streak that is extremely hard to explain. On more than one occasion I saw her physically attack children, animals and even her own elderly parents while they were still alive. 

I moved away from my mother at the age of 10, and for the decade that followed I tried to be a good son. I would visit a few times each year, and call at least once a week. During this time she degenerated from an alcoholic, to a hard drug user, eventually finding religion and becoming ""born again"". But despite her new found ""faith"", she remained just as cruel as ever. For her, God was a vengeful being, bent on revenge and punishment. In her twisted world view, Jesus had no problem with cruelty, so long as we are faithful. 

Faithful to what exactly? I don't know. 

When I was in my early 20s I went to visit my mother, and we ended up going for a long drive together. We hadn't planned anything, but we ended up in the mountains about an hour west of town, and decided to go for a hike like we used to. She was actually in a rather pleasant mood that day, and I had some important news to share- I was about to become a father myself. 

After an hour or so of hiking and talking about this news, we stopped at a little plateau to admire the view. The ledge was next to a steep drop off, offering an incredible view of the rockies behind us. It was like something out of a National Geographic special. I suggested we take a photo of ourselves, and she agreed. 

I setup my camera hanging from a dead tree, and aimed it using the strap so that the view would be behind us. I set the timer for 60 seconds, and walked back towards the edge of the cliff. I smiled for the camera, and gestured for my mother to join me. She did. 

A moment later a green light blinked at us, and something inside me activated.

Something that had been there all along. 

Something that is still deep inside me now. 

Without hesitation, I turned and shoved her off the edge of the plateau as hard as I could. I watched her eyes glow with fierce rage as her neck snapped forward. She stumbled for a step or two, and then toppled over, off the edge. 

It was so surreal. She looked like Wile E. Coyote. I laughed. Not at her pain, just the absurdity of the situation. And just like the Wile E. Coyote from the cartoons, she was silent. The only sound was the snapping of pine tree branches, and the chirps of frightened birds. 

I calmly hiked down and around, towards where the body was. As I approached, I could hear a soft gurgling, and I was amazed to find her sill alive, partially impaled on a stump. I'm no doctor, but there was a lot of blood. My guess is that she punctured a lung, because she couldn't talk, she could only drool blood and gurgle at me. 

I pulled out my cell phone- no bars. I wanted to stay, and watch her die, but I knew the time had come to act rationally again. I hiked towards the car at a double pace, and called 911 as soon as I found some reception again. 

The operator had a sweet southern drawl, and asked me if I knew where I was. Of course I did- I had hiked those mountains a thousand times. She said authorities were on the way, and I knew I had an hour at least.

I rushed back to the body, but it was too late. She had already died. I didn't touch the body, I didn't move her; I wanted to make sure I had as few questions to answer as possible. 

To cut to the quick, the death was ruled an accident, and I was never charged with anything. My mother was a piece of shit, so no one else really cared that she was dead, and no one had reason to suspect me, the sorrowful grieving son who had come to visit his mother like a good little boy, of anything. I never even took a polygraph- no one asked me to. 

So why am I telling this to you, /r/confession? I'll tell you why. 

Just a few minutes ago, my son, who is now in the 4th grade, was sent home from school early for brawling. And he came home to find me here in my home office, working, as I usually do. Eager to change the subject, he grabbed a photo that I leave on my desk and asked me about it. I grabbed it back away from him, and sent him off to his room. 

But after sitting here, and just staring into this photo for awhile, I felt the need to share. 

After all, it is one of my favorite photos.

It felt so good that I ended up stripping down and rubbing it directly on my clit. I'm pretty sure that's how I had my first orgasm.

Now, as a grown adult, I keep one of those figurines that I used all these years tucked away in my underwear drawer and still use it to get off on. No dildos, no vibrators. Just that.

But this time Its not my fault I promise. My straight jock buddy and I get together every weekend to hang out, drink beers, talk about pussy, you know, the usual. But lately we've been spending almost every day together and we say 'I love you' several times whenever we hang out. He even kissed me on the cheek yesterday (needless to say I got butterflies)

Hes smart (really smart), cute but with that delicious low-confidence thing happening, and the worst part is that he's told me he's curious but he just doesn't want to fool around. When I asked if we could fool around one day he said 'Maybe, just don't ask'. &gt;&lt;

I refer to him as my straight boyfriend, and he likes it. He has no problems with watching gay porn or seeing dick and he's seen mine/Iv seen his (soft, though). It really makes me frustrated that he's willing to go just far enough to get me riled up and then pulls back and does a 180.

I don't think he realizes the impact he has on me. Im putty in his hands for the most part and I hate the feeling of doing whatever he wants without getting what I want back. Part of me wants to say that he is only thinking of himself when he refuses to fool around or even more, and that he is unconcerned with what I want. Maybe he just doesn't know that he's so important to me.

The thing which is really hurting for me is that he is perfect for me, and me for him. He was describing over the phone to another friend his ideal relationship, and we both looked at each other awkwardly because he described me to a tee. He's really smart, he raps, he's lots of fun. He's always got an idea for how to have fun. Meanwhile Im coolheaded, responsible, a planner. We have deep intellectual conversations which we can't have with anyone else. Sexually we're both huge perverts of nearly the same variety. He even thinks Im cute.

I thought I was too old for this. I don't know if Im falling in love or if having this guy so close to me is reminding me what it is like to have someone that close. Unfortunately, he's as close as he'l ever want to be, which is half-way into my heart. It makes me feel invaded, or maybe that my defences are too weak to have let him in that far.

She went from sweet, caring, affectionate and sexual to mean, self-absorbed, cold, and asexual, to the point that we no longer have any meaningful relationship. 

This seems very much like post-partum depression or something similar. But she refuses to seek help, claims that all of her friends are the same way, that this kind of change is perfectly normal, and that I'm the one with a problem for not changing myself in the same way like all other guys do.

And yet, she constantly talks about how tired and stressed she is, how she doesn't know if she can take it any longer, and how sometimes she just wishes she wouldn't wake up one morning. She also has said ""God, that's enough; I can't take this life anymore,"" and other suicidal comments.

Considering the state of our relationship I not only find it hard to muster up sympathy, but in a way think it might be a good overall solution for everybody, rather than forcing the kids and I to deal with this dark persona for the rest of our lives. 

That is, until she started wondering what would happen to our kids if she were gone, how much they might miss her, and how she couldn't bear to think of them going through life lonely and without her.

I expected the next statement to be ""so I guess I need to work harder to be there for them.""  But it wasn't.  That's where she stopped.

I just noticed this subreddit a few days ago and kept wanting to post this with my real account but I just can't bring myself to do that so please accept my apologies for using a throwaway account. Maybe one day I'll have the courage to use my real account but right now I just want to tell this to someone, to anyone, without risking having anyone I know in real life trace it back to me.

The first person I had sex with was a young boy. Eleven or twelve, I can't remember. I was his little sister's babysitter. I was seventeen at the time and considering having sex with my first serious boyfriend. But he broke up with me earlier that day because he got mad at me for choosing to babysit over hanging out with him. I'm pretty sure he thought I was finally ready to sleep with him which is why he was so mad that I took the job when I was asked to babysit. The truth is that yes I had been considering finally doing it and that I was scared. But also and this is what he didn't understand, I needed the money. Unlike him I didn't have parents who gave me an allowance or anything. I made my money through my babysitting jobs or from this one company I worked for leaving leaflets in mailboxes around the neighborhood.

I was supposed to just watch the girl, who was about six years old, that night. But after putting her to bed the boy came home unexpectedly. Apparently he'd gotten into a fight with the friend he'd been supposed to be spending the night with. He was really upset about the fight and was in tears. I tried everything I could to comfort him but he was inconsolable. Finally I just hugged him and told him that his friend was a jerk and that he should forget about him.

That's when he kissed me. And I didn't stop him. Even when he began to fondle my breasts I didn't stop him. I don't think I did anything to encourage him but I know I didn't do anything to stop him either.

It's funny. This kid, this little boy, he took MY hand and put it between HIS legs like he was teaching me about how to make out or something. What's not funny is the fact that I just went along with it. I don't know if it was out of embarrassment or shame or actual desire or whatever but I did. God damn, I went along with it. And that's how I lost my virginity Reddit. To a child I felt sorry for and in the most awkward situation imaginable. 

All these years later my official ""first time"" story is completely different. I haven't ever told anyone, not even my husband about the real first time. The truth makes me feel like a child molester or something. My husband knows about the time I gave a blowjob to a stranger to pay for bus fair once, he knows about an awful thing I did to one of my siblings that no one else knows and I will never tell anyone else about, he knows about pretty much all of my secrets but he does not know about this. No one does. Except the boy obviously.

Like I said in the title you can ask me anything but I'm not sure I'll ever even log in to this account again.

My sister had pulled away my towel while walking back from the shower. Her friends were there and saw my junk. They were relentless. For years that's all I heard when they were over. I became bitter. I even hated the idea of sex because it would make me vulnerable. I started to fight a lot because I needed to assert my dominance because of how emasculated I felt. Know that annoying guy that will correct you if you say one thing wrong? That's me. Asserting my knowledge so you think I have more worth. Or so I thought. Turns out it just makes me look like an asshole. It's no wonder I have no friends at all. I avoided asking out any girl I found attractive. And when I had my first relationship I let it interfere with that. She put up with my insecurity like a champ for 3 years, but I never believed her. I thought I couldn't please her. And when we did have sex, all i could think about was how disappointing it must be for her. She loved sex and I started to hate it because of my stupid mindset. We broke up and now it's my biggest regret. 

Ads like Extenze don't help either. Or smiling fucking bob. Fuck you bob. Every time I turn on the TV I'm bombarded with the fact that women don't want a guy with a small penis and it makes me feel worthless. Beyond worthless.  Plus my best friend and all of his girlfriends constantly talk about his junk. Like I want to know that. 

I'm so fucking resentful and scared all the time because of it. 

The bright side is it's because of my weight. Fat guys have a layer of fat around the base of their dick that covers the bottom of the shaft. So my dick might actually be 6 or 7 inches hard, but because of the fat I top out at about 4. I'm on my way to losing it and god dammit I cant wait to not be afraid. I want to have sex. Real sex. Passionate sex where I don't have to worry about pleasing her because I know I can do it. And I want to be able to actually wear a condom. Because of how short my dick is, it slips off after a few ""thrusts"". That's in quotes because how can you thrust something in that's only 4 inches long? More like poking.

That was way longer than I expected it to be. But I've never told a single person how bad my insecurity is. Sure my ex kind of knew, but not to this extent. I loathe myself. I love my personality, most of the time I'm quirky and silly, and I have fun. I love my mind. I like to consider myself smart. But it still doesn't make up for the thing I desire most.

So here is the story.
When I was twelve my mom and I went to this church. They had this really nice little youth group with about fifteen of us. Well Martin Luther King Weekend, all of us went up to Big Bear to go snowboarding. I had never been and looked forward to it. I also had a crush on one of the older boys, nothing serious, just being twelve.


The first night we got up there, a huge group of us stayed up till 2 am, just talking and laughing. When we all decided to pass out for the night, I made my way to a couch. About 20 minutes into falling asleep I was pulled down to the floor by one of the boys. His name was Daniel and he was about 15. He was known to be a dick of sorts. No one really liked him too much. He started getting touchy with me and tried to put his hands up my shirt. Now to be honest, I am small breasted. And I look very young for my age. I will be able to pull off at least 18 until I am about 27. I don't really see his interest in 12 year old me. I was cute but very lanky.


I kept telling him no. He kept pushing. It was a bible trip, so I said I was waiting. The next thing he said to me crushed me. He asked 'why, not like anyone else is ever going to want you anyway'.


This really shock me hard because my mother was/is already very abusive. In public she would show me off like a prize dog, but when she would get mad at me, she would tell me how worthless and useless I was. How I would never amount to anything, and how it was her good graces I wasn't on the street or in foster care. I used to spend so much time convincing myself how worthless I wasn't. She only said that because she was just mad. I just tried to justify her action by saying how bad I was and I deserved those words for whatever trouble I did cause but it was okay, because if I tried hard to be could be the perfect daught, and therefore she would stop.


Hearing that from him almost justified everything my mother ever said to me. Suddenly it made sense. They were both right. No one would ever want me. So I finally let him touch me, and he went crazy. No sex or anything below the belt. He didn't try but I wouldn't have even notice if he did. I was tearing up and crying quietly because I knew it. I was worthless. Once he was done, he told me to leave me alone. After that trip he treated me worse than everyone else. But I let it happen. I let everyone walk on me. I couldn't help it.
I know I am not worthless but that and how my mother treated me growing up really messed me up. I am constantly looking for people to tell me good things about myself, even though I will never believe them. I cling to people who seem to like me because I am afraid if I don't I will lose them. This action usually leads to them not liking me but I cannot help it; friends and lovers alike end up running from that. I am so afraid that both of those people are right and everyday that my life seems worthless I spin in a never ending depression.


I am actually crying right now because rethinking about it really makes me feel terrible. I've only told two other people about it. My best friend, and my last ex. Both asked in a very serious manner and that's the only reason but never in detail. My mother has asked me several times if I have been touched but I know she only means by an older man. Something inside of me thinks that if I do tell her, she'll call me a slut and blame me. That's why I didn't tell anyone. Until now.


I hope this post can help me get over this, and to also make aware to others out there that you should probably talk to someone, because holding it in has mad my life miserable.

This girl &amp; I planned to meet up for some revision. We did actually get lots of it done, went through lots of past papers on Artificial Intelligence &amp; talked lots. When it was getting later, she said she had a pizza at home [she lives like two minutes from where we were revising], so I went back to hers for some food.

Stayed in her room chatting for a while after, sitting on her bed, exchanging looks every now &amp; then which lasted a bit longer than usual. We slouched &amp; leaned together &amp; there was a few pauses in the conversation where we did nothing but smile at each other shyly. One lasted longer than the others. I could see her breaths getting shallower &amp; her heartbeat quicken while we stared at each other. I can’t remember who moved but suddenly we were kissing.

I hadn’t kissed anyone since I was fifteen, &amp; we were making out &amp; I had no idea what I was doing. She sat on my lap facing me &amp; we kept kissing for what seemed like forever. She has really soft lips. In between kisses we opened our eyes a little &amp; smiled nervously. My breath was a bit shaky. I was nervous, but not as much as I thought I’d be.

We fell to the side &amp; I was on top of her, still kissing. She wrapped her legs around me, I ran my fingers through her hair &amp; hers through mine, I took my glasses off. Started grinding a bit. I slide my hand down the back of her jeans &amp; felt her bum, &amp; at another point felt her breast. Did different combinations of this for a while until she unbuckled my belt. We took our clothes off, kept kissing, feeling with our hands.

Incredibly embarrassingly, I couldn’t get hard, no matter what stimulation :( I have no idea why as well. Perhaps it was nerves, whatever, I’m so frustrated at myself. My first time here &amp; I’ve still retained my virginity. Not something I’m concerned about, but I feel like I’ve disappointed her. I managed to be so when we were just staring at each other, hearts racing. Urgh.

I think we gave up at a bit at sex then. We just lay naked on each other, a bit of pillow talk, making each other laugh, kissing &amp; tickling each other. I still had fun, but I feel I’ve really let her down :(

I find her interesting. We make each other laugh. She’s a really beautiful girl, &amp; she has a lovely body - curvy with soft skin &amp; softer lips. We have quite a few things in common. I don’t know if I can see a relationship in it though. I just don’t think that It felt enough. It transpires that she’s fancied me for a while now. She has talked to me on Facebook more than ever recently, ever since that last impossible assignment before Christmas we talked a fair bit discussing it &amp; feminism.

She's one of those quite sensual people &amp; I don't know if that makes me feel invalid or what.

I thought I dealt with this shit years ago and I KNOW I am not an actual suicide threat, because I'd never actually go through with it, so why the fuck is it the first thing I think of every time something goes wrong??

I get a bad grade, I say something embarrassing, I go a long while without talking to a friend, it's the same thing. Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself. What would people do if you killed yourself? I wonder what would happen if you killed yourself right now. You're crossing the street right now, would you jump out of the way if a car came towards you? If you had a heart attack right now who would care? What would happen? That's a long fall. Maybe you should kill yourself now because people would have more years to forget you. How long would it take people to forget you? Who wouldn't forget you? My parents, but most people would get over it. 

All of those thoughts, constantly, all the time. Even on a good day, a sunny day, where mostly everything is going right, somewhere somehow the thought will appear. Oh, you still don't have a job for this summer. What would happen if you killed yourself?

It doesn't help that my boyfriend has similar issues and I'm always telling him that I used to be there too and I'm so much better now. Well, guess what. I'm clearly still fucked up. I know I'm not gonna do it. I just want the constant thoughts about it to fucking stop.

I found a local place and with all my beginner’s enthusiasm, I went hard at it.

A little while after this, I noticed an uncomfortable sensation in my ass, like right up my butthole. I investigated (digitally) and found the source: there was definitely something up there. I then did the dignified mirror squat, and got a visual: it was a deep red, very tight little bubble poking out my butthole.

Though some of you will have already twigged, this phenomena was entirely new to me. The only rational explanation I could come up with was that as I’d been working out, my muscles had grown, only now all my other organs no longer had enough room in there, and as a result the bottom of my liver had been forced out via the only available outlet. I thought my liver was slowly but surely being forced out of my anus.

So, believing myself to have a potentially very serious disorder, I did the only sensible thing: absolutely nothing. I thought my internal organs were being forced out my own ass, yet I didn’t tell or see anyone about it. Two weeks I spent worrying about whether this condition would be reversible, even scaring myself that it might be fatal, yet I didn’t do a thing.

Firstly: it was my ass. Not my bum, not the cheeks, but right up my hole, and I simply wasn’t comfortable showing that to anyone. And also - for some reason - on a subconscious level I felt shame over it. Perhaps because it was my ass and thus hard wired to my neural circuits in charge of everything ‘taboo’, but on a very deep level, I somehow believed it was my fault, that I deserved it, that it was a sign of some deep personal failing.

Finally, it clearly wasn’t going away and I went to see a doctor, who explained it was just hemorrhoids. She explained how they work and that they’re very common to people who work out and that they’re very treatable.

This was a huge relief. But for those two weeks, I believed my guts were hanging out my ass and it was all my fault.",,True,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,True,t3_or7lu,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/or7lu/the_time_my_internal_organs_were_falling_out_of/,

My boyfriend and I (that I am still with and very much in love with) kept it a secret from everyone except a couple of our closest friends that were trying to help us out until I was about 6 months along. 
     When my parents first found out they immediately wanted me to keep their grandchild and even started to push marriage between my boyfriend and I. However after a week of them cooling down from the initial shock of finding out that their straight-A, perfect daughter was pregnant they left the decision of what to do completely up to my boyfriend and myself.           My boyfriend was all for adoption (as I'm assuming MOST 18 year old boys in his situation would feel....if they haven't already bailed) but he was still leaving the decision up to me. In the end I chose adoption for various reasons. 
I know that I broke my parent's hearts but I was strong minded in my decision and pushed through my guilt. 
Back then I didn't ever think that I would grow to love her as much as I do now. Even when I started bonding with her a bit shortly after her birth. Now I just wish I had kept her. We did an open adoption so we visit her regularly and my mom has grown to love her adoptive mom as a daughter. I'm watching her grow up so beautifully and fast that I just wish her world revolved around me and not her mom. Somehow she has come to understand that I am her mother as well because whenever I visit she will do this thing where she will run between her mom and I yelling ""my mama! my mama!"" and hug our legs. I have been told that she will quickly pick me out in pictures and identifies me as her ""mama"" and it makes me feel so good! I feel so warm inside and I feel my heart swell. I want to visit her more and more often so that she won't forget that I'm her mom too but I know it wouldn't be fair to her or her parents. 
I can't talk to my parents about this because I need them to know that even though I miss her with all my heart, I still do not regret my decision because she is happy in every way possible for a 2 year old and I love her parents. I can't talk to my boyfriend about this either because he doesn't feel the same way and I don't want to bring him down or make him somehow think that he is to blame.

I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but as I grew I realized what he did was wrong and I can't help but realize how that incident effected me on my life.

Throughout my teens I was constantly experimenting.  I would watch porn with my friends and we would masturbate in front of each other.  There were a couple of times where I would perform oral on them.  I knew it was wrong and I knew I was straight, but the fact that I was aroused by these acts confused me tremendously.  

The first time I really felt disgusted with myself was when I was around 16.  I had sex with this 12/13 yo gay boy in fact, this was my first time EVER having sex.  This kid was my neighbor and I knew he was more sexually inclined than I was.  He would come over every now and then to hang out and would subtly drop hints of wanting something more.  He would place items (ps controller for example) on my lap.  He would find ways to sit next to me and make some type of contact with me.  I knew it was wrong, but part of me was turned on.  One day when he was close I decided to go for it and I placed my hand on his inner thigh.  He responded positively and we proceeded to follow through until we were both finished.  As soon as he left I was immediately disgusted with myself.  How could have I committed those acts?  I was paranoid.  Fortunately, he was ok with everything and his family moved away soon after.  Even though I've never done anything like that since, my lust for internet porn never went away.

I'm a bit tired from typing right now, but I do have more to get off my chest.  I am happily married to a wonderful woman and she does not know anything.  I'll be glad to answer questions.  AMAA

I got behind the wheel WHILE drinking the rest of the wine in the paper cup. A few blocks later, a cop pulls me over for driving past his blockade.

I immediately threw the cup under the seat. I did NOT speak to him. At all. I simply looked at him and gave him my license and registration. I didn't open my mouth to answer any of his questions coz I knew I reeked of booze. I thought I was going to jail for sure. He wrote me a ticket and let me go. I was stunned.

During our first year together, her ex had moved out of state and had pretty much zero contact with the kids.  There was one visit, but that's it.  No phone calls, emails, birthday cards, or Christmas presents.  He eventually remarried, and from what we know has started his new family/life.  He never provided any sort of support.

I legally adopted the kids and had their names and birth certificates changed to reflect it.

My wife and I did end up having a child of our own, as well.

My kids are now 16 1/2 (girl), 14 1/2 (boy), and 8 (girl) and none know that the older two are not my biological children.  They all have physical characteristics that can be attributed to me, so looks haven't really been an issue at all.  I love my kids dearly, and don't think of them as anything other than mine.

I know that they're going to have to know at some point, I just haven't been able to figure out when to tell them.  My oldest has gone through some teenage rebellion crap, and I could see this causing a rift which honestly, I'm afraid of.  My son will probably take it better, but I could see him being hurt, and I don't want to put him through that anytime soon.  I know that my youngest knows them as her siblings, and don't want to cause any stress for her either.

There was a girl who had the audacity to bring half sheets of typed notes and sit in front of people in our class and put them in her book to use during the exam. After the professor handed out the exams, I handed the professor a note that told what the girl did.

She constantly criticizes me and orders me around but I've been able to look past that.

A girl from my school who I've always thought was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen but never said a word to, approached me the other day at a party which my girlfriend wasn't at. We talked and flirted non-stop for 6 hours straight and I found out we have the exact same taste in music, TV shows, movies, and to my surprise, videogames (We both love Metal Gear Solid 3). 

She kept moving closer to me, holding my hands, ""accidentally"" touching my ass, and she kept suggesting I should sleep at her house. But I kept saying no, thinking of my girlfriend, and at the end of the night, when she went in for a kiss, I shook her hand.

The next day I was greeted with more criticism and complaining from my girlfriend when I realized that I should have taken the offer from the other girl. I've had a constant knot in my stomach for days now because I like the other girl so much more than my girlfriend yet I continue to tell my girlfriend that I love her.

I've decided that I have to break up with my girlfriend because I can't do this to her or myself. I have lost my chance with the girl from the party because she found out I have a girlfriend and now thinks I'm a scumbag for hitting on her while I'm taken.

There it is, it's off my chest. I'm not looking for advice really but if you have any to offer, please do.

UPDATE: So I spoke to the girl from the party, she apologized for getting mad at me, she said she was just upset that I have a girlfriend, we are on good terms now. I haven't broken up with my girlfriend yet as she's going on vacation in a few days and I can't bring myself to ruin it for her. When the time is right, I'll end my relationship and start talking to the girl from the party. Thanks for the advice, everyone.

1375058660.0,84,self.confession,1j8v5x,I pretend to be a girl online and It's destroying my life,108,24,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1j8v5x/i_pretend_to_be_a_girl_online_and_its_destroying/,"Throwaway because this is my first time using Reddit and I don't know what I'm doing (though I've been lurking for a good few years).

So me, I'm a recently-turned 20 year-old Black American male who's been pretending to be a girl online for maybe the past eight years. Let me tell you a little about myself before I get to my problem. I try to think of myself as one of the nicest people I know and really take the ""Do unto others as you would have others do unto you"" thing to heart. I live at home with my mother and have a side-job to bring in a few dollars (but nowhere near a real job), who, she, also lives with her abusive boyfriend. I don't have any friends, or even leave my home much. I don't even interact with my family really, detached from my mother and sisters, all who misunderstand me. In fact, I think everyone who knows me misunderstands me, not knowing how depressed I really am. I'm a programmer and basically spend all my time on my computer, doing nothing for most of that time. I'm not a mean person, or even ugly by any means, but I just can't seem to make friends. Maybe I'm just uninteresting.. 

Anywho, as for my problem, I randomly tried being a girl online for a few days some 7-8 years ago and made a few friends as such. I didn't want to randomly disappear from them and kind of stuck being a girl, which led to more friends and it snowballed from there. I don't do anything sexual or anything that is gender-specific, but really just talk to them as who I really am, as if I weren't even a girl. I now have some friends who I've known for around 4 years now and I feel it'll be heart wrenching to them if I reveal to them who I really am. They haven't seen any pictures or heard my voice but take my word for it all, effectively earning their trust when I'm just lying to them.

Now, I've hated what I've done ever since those friendships were formed, but if I do confess to them, then I'll be left with no one, as they're my only friends I really have. Of course, I stopped going around as a girl when not around them and tried to make friends as such, but that has lead me down an empty road, still leading me back to the friends who know me as a girl.

What really put the cherry on top is a few days ago, I met this girl who I feel really, really likes me, and I do back her, but she knows me as a girl, not who I really am. It hasn't even been a week yet and she is making me think about all this time I've wasted pretending online to be someone who I am not and it's really depressing me into the depths of hell. I now feel like coming out to her (and my other friends) and most likely losing everyone because of my one stupid lie.

No one knows about me pretending about this, not my family or anyone. Only a select few people online know that I am depressed, but no one really knows how bad I actually am. I'm not the kind of depressed that leads to self harm, but a lonely kind of depression. I talk to people, quite a lot actually, but it's always about what they want to talk about. I don't know anyone who is near interested in the same things as me and it sucks.

Please excuse my bad typing, I've never confessed anything to anyone really. I just want to tell her and everyone the truth and see if she still accepts me, or lose her and everyone else and become friendless and falling even more into depression. I'm confusing myself as I type this. I have even more skeletons in my closet that I haven't even mentioned here, or to anyone else and I just want to let my life somehow and ease my burden.


TL;DR I'm a depressed person who wants to tell everyone I've lied to them for years and lose the only friends I have in my life.

I also have had several close friends suffer through molestation at the hands of disgusting fucking pedophiles, which makes this oh so much worse.

Okay. I am 18 and my girlfriend is 17. We've been going out for about 4 months now. I recently found out that she used to be...ummm..'involved' with much older men during her younger teen years. It started out as her sending them pictures and videos from when she was about 12. This eventually evolved into her...'meeting' some of these men. This started when she was 13 and kept going until she was 15. She would sometimes even spend days at a time with these 'people', and at one point an entire week while her parents were on holiday. Some of them beat the shit of her, but she didn't do anything and continued to see them because she 'loved' them.

When she told me, I acted as if it was fine, and all in the past and that I didn't care. I lied. I haven't seen her for 3 weeks due to conflicting schedules (work, college etc.), but we've been texting and talking on facebook and stuff in that time. 

But whenever I think of her now, all I can see is her being fucked by these disgusting fucks. Every time I think of her, she's sucking their dicks, she's being fucked by them. I feel sick. Now the thought of anything sexual makes me feel ill and dirty. I even tried browsing some porn out of pure boredom but I immediately felt horrible and pictured her as those girls.

I wish they would reinstate the death penalty in my state and have all those cunts executed.

1361497209.0,84,self.confession,18zrs5,I've been sleeping with my old boss for the past three months in exchange for rent money. I hate him and myself. ,113,29,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18zrs5/ive_been_sleeping_with_my_old_boss_for_the_past/,"I was working an internship at a law firm and when it was nearing its end I was having a difficult time finding another job. Desperate, I accepted my boss's proposition - though it was vague I got the gist. I told myself it would be a one time thing but he continued to text me after the internship had ended asking if I needed any help. I did. Before I knew it it had been a month and I had retreated so far into myself it had become routine. To make things worse I had just reconnected with an old boyfriend about a month prior to this and though we weren't sure of our ""status"" or whatever, it was pretty obvious we were falling for each again. 


Fast forward three months and I still haven't been able to find a job. The constant rejection and weight of what I was doing left me numb and lethargic. I finally admitted what was going on to my boyfriend and now I think I've lost him forever. I can't bear the thought of not having him but at the same time I don't have any other means of making rent or paying my loans right now. The way he looked at me made me feel worse than I've ever felt in my life and I've felt sick to my stomach ever since. I know he'll never be able to look at me the same way again and I just don't know what to do. He said he needed time and I respect that but I'm scared that him living a half hour away means it will be easier for him to just say ""fuck it"" and move on. Regardless of whether he comes back or not, telling someone made the reality of the situation - the reality that I had been suppressing - all too apparent. It lit a fire under my ass to find a job - any job - so that I can get away. My boyfriend thinks that my boss, whom I had listed as a reference, was purposely giving me bad reviews in order to keep me dependent. I don't know if I buy it, but having had over 13 interviews and no offers maybe he's right. Regardless, I'm not going to list him anymore and we'll see what happens.  I guess I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just needed to tell someone.




edit: I had my roommate call him and pretend she was from a temp agency. My boyfriend was right. Before she even asked him any questions he started to badmouth me (which was sort of good, since we didn't really know what to ask). ""She listed ME as a reference? I wasn't even aware. If she had asked me I would have told her I can't in **good conscience** give her a good review and she should find someone else. I guess there was no one else.""

I already have the day I'm breaking up with him planned.",117,35,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/14j1ej/a_week_ago_my_boyfriend_asked_that_we_make_things/,"Well, not the exact day.. but somewhere in the middle of January.

We met a year ago, and started casually dating soon after meeting. He is wonderful. Things got pretty awesome. Very awesome.

We never made things official. Neither of us were seeing other people - I didn't want to and I believe him when he said he didn't want to.. but we still kept things slow, wanting to get to know each other much better first. Everything just got better, and better.. Until, at the beginning of December, he asked. He just came out with it. Against all my better judgement, I said yes. Yes, lets make this official, even though we probably didn't need to declare it..

Against my judgement.. The thing is, two years ago he got separated from his wife. They didn't get a divorce and still havn't. This didn't bother me at all at first. Didn't even consider it, we were just dating and things were awesome. She seemed totally off the scene, hundreds of miles away and living with the guy she cheated on my boyfriend with.

Until two weeks before he asked me to officially be his girlfriend. Be exclusive. He told me, in casual conversation, that he wasn't planning to get a divorce from her. It was relevant to the conversation - we were talking about holidays, he mentioned his honeymoon, joked that the company was terrible even if the place was fantastic, and the conversation went on from there. So, he's not planning to get a divorce from her ever - for no other reason than he's *not bothered* about getting divorced from her and he can't be doing with the cost. He hinted slightly that she seemed to try to get money from him, but didn't expand much on this apart from her trying to get half his savings last year despite them having been separated for a long time.

This set something off in the back of my mind instantly, like a warning sign, but at the time I didn't realise why I felt weird about it. Then I got to thinking after that conversation, did realise.

This will be hanging over the relationship. Things wont be progressing. He acts serious about me, hints about us moving in together someday - his best friend tells me I'm the best thing that's happened to my boyfriend for a long time, that he knows my boyfriend is in this for the long haul - but that doesn't matter. Things wont progress. This relationship is doomed to failure, really, with us.. just being like this until it does. Separate. 

No moving in together. Ever. He's hinted that he likes the idea of us living together, yeah, but how can I live with him with his ex-wife apparently wanting money? Somehow, our finances will overlap if we live together - at least if we buy shared items. Do I really want to be in that position? She will be there. And even disregarding the financial side of that, she will *still* be there hanging over this. 

Marriage. Now, I've never been hungry for marriage. I certainly don't want to marry my current boyfriend right now - it's only been a year. Maybe he and I would *never* get married because the relationship doesnt get that far for unrelated reasons - perfectly cool. But when I was thinking about the situation, my stomach dropped in a weird way that I didn't expect when it came to the marriage part. Do I want to get married in the future? Maybe. I don't know. I think so, with someone very right for me. But it wont even be an option in this case. Just a piece of paper or not, it wont be an option.

If things *do* get that far.. if I do find myself falling in love with this guy.. it wont be an option. That makes my stomach drop.

Do I want to risk that..

Do I really want to be in a relationship where, no matter long we stay together, we can never even so much as move in together? A relationship that cannot move forward at all? More so than that, a relationship that seems to be getting quite serious, a relationship that really really *works*, but can still never progress?

Where I am girlfriend, but she will always be *wife*? I sort of want someone to love me enough to call me 'wife' one day. I want the chance, at least. Am I wasting time with this guy, knowing that will *definitely* never happen.. even if things work brilliantly and I fall head over heels, **when I could be free and single to find someone who will* be open to calling me that one day?** Who could love me as I love them? Someone I can even just move in with if that worked? Someone where the relationship can progress.. ?

I decided no. I can't do this. This relationship is going to end anyway. With no progression.

But I said yes anyway. He asked. I was shocked. My mind did some very hectic thinking on the spot. I said yes.

Why?

I wanted a bit of happiness. I'm being utterly selfish. It's near Christmas, it's near New Year.. and I like this guy. A whole lot. The thought of 'having him' for Christmas and winter walks and cuddles.. I just want a months break from the reality of the situation. Just... a month to lie to myself, be happy. I'm not doing it for gifts. I've already told him I don't want to do gifts, to avoid him buying me any when I'm just going to leave him. That was a lie too. I bought him the fancy version of a new Android tablet - something he wanted, but couldn't afford right now. Figured that even if he's pissed about my lie, doesn't fucking matter because I'm breaking up with him soon after Xmas anyway and he wants the tablet so he's going to have it.

So... that's that. I'm lying to him. I'm leading him along. I'm lying to myself. Heck, you can tell I'm not really lying to myself very efficiently.. I'm still thinking about this. But at least, at Christmas, I'll be able to pretend that I'm not in his wifes shadow, and that this relationship has not come to a pointless end before it's even begun.

I like talking with my bf about fantasies, doing role play in sex, so on. We've had two threesomes in the six years we've been together and it's been good.

A couple years ago I brought up the idea of him having sex with my sister. She's younger than me, cute, all that. We'd chat about it, sometimes I liked him to talk to me like I was her when we had sex, all that. She and I were also pretty open, and I'd joke around with her about. They were friends and got along all right.

I went out of town a few months ago and I joked to her about ""keeping him company"" while I was away. Well she did, they got together at our place and basically had sex the whole week. When I got back and was getting into the mood with my bf, he brought it up. I thought at first he was just fantasy talking, but then it was obvious it actually went down. I played along but was really just shocked. Then the next day I talked to her about it and she confirmed it and said how fun it finally was.

They have gotten together a couple times since then. I feel like shit but I stirred it all up for so long with both of them I don't think its their fault, especially with my bf. I don't say anything except that it sounds hot or whatever because I don't know how to bring it up. I'm not even really mad at him.

1371507873.0,81,self.confession,1gjnxo,I am an animal thief.,119,38,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1gjnxo/i_am_an_animal_thief/,"It all started last summer when my boyfriend and I noticed that one of our neighbors had a rabbit sitting out on their front porch. We live in a really hot and humid area and it was a french lop rabbit, long hair, long ears. We would check every day when we drove by to see if the rabbit was still outside. We never once saw them go out to play with it or feed it or ever take it inside. We also noticed that relative to the rabbit's size, the cage was way too small. I know, rabbits can be outside, but most of the ones that are, are in a hutch with some shade, at least. This one was outside with a wire cage, not much shade at all.

So, we hatched a plan. We waited a few weeks and then made our move. It was a Thursday morning around 3am when our neighborhood is pretty dead. We dressed in all black, had some walkie talkies with headsets, the whole deal. My boyfriend went in a vacant area across the street and was my look out. When the coast was clear, I ran over to the porch with my face hidden (just in case they had video surveillance) and I grabbed the cage with the rabbit inside and wobbled my way to our backyard and then inside the house. I didn't expect the cage to be so big, so my plan of running with it did not work out very well. It was still a small cage for the rabbit, but I definitely had trouble carrying it back.

Luckily we had planned this out in advance, and I had some hay and veggies to last it through the night. I gave it some fresh water and everything and after it settled down a bit, let it hop around our room for a few minutes. She was super scared and we quickly learned how rabbits show fear - they stomp their back feet really loudly.

Anyways, the story had a happy ending and we had already lined up a home for the sweetie, since we couldn't keep her. She now has a wonderful home living in the air conditioning. She's super spoiled and her new owner got her spayed and treats her very well.


Now, we are planning on stealing another neighbor's animal. It's summer time again, and the poor dog looks like a stray. If you were walking by, you wouldn't know that it had owners. They let her roam the streets, leave her out all day, and let her get infested with fleas. I bought her some flea medicine and applied it one night when she was outside - the fact that I could do that undetected should let you know her ""owners"" could give a shit less about her. I already bought food for her and give her water daily. She is still filthy but we need to line up a home for her before we steal her and give her a bath and everything. Again, we can't keep the animal, but we do want her to find a better home. She basically lives outside. I noticed she's not scratching as much, so the flea medicine worked and I have more if need be.

I can't wait to take her away from the people who don't care enough to take care of their dog. I have constantly gone over to tell them their dog got out again, and they reply, ""Oh yeah, she gets out from the backyard."" They don't take her inside very often (and she's a small breed dog, one that is usually a lap dog..) and just let her run around. I'm surprised she hasn't been hit by a car yet. She's super sweet and I really can't wait to rescue her. I constantly worry about if she's outside in the heat every day. I hope she can hold on just a little bit longer..",,False,,t5_2qo2a,1371508906.0,,,True,t3_1gjnxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1gjnxo/i_am_an_animal_thief/,

1359696051.0,88,self.confession,17ogw7,Every girl I've ever seen/dated/had a relationship with had a boyfriend before I came into the picture. I'm a homewrecker.,118,30,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17ogw7/every_girl_ive_ever_seendatedhad_a_relationship/,"I actually didn't realize that I had a bad habit of being a homewrecker until recently. Obviously, I knew what I'd done before I noticed it as a habit, but I thought it purely coincidence. I now see that I'm a weak, self-conscious, pathetic excuse for a person. In need of constant validation, I've subconsciously made this a habit. It may be clear to you, but it certainly wasn't to me until recently; I do this for the extra kick of knowing the girl is cheating on/breaking up with another guy for me. I'm not dumb; I could spot this in someone else in a minute. I was just in a deep sort of denial, as admitting to it would be admitting to my own weakness.

Anyway, no girl has broken up with someone else and then come to me. They've always cheated, then either pushed me out of their life or left the other guy to start something with me. I know that I lose control and manipulate them to do this. **HOWEVER**, I never force anything. It's only ever happened once I realized that we've become close and they want something more, even if only once. That's when I push all respect for myself, the girl, and her boyfriend, out the window. It's now just about making something happen.

To address anyone feeling sympathetic towards me here: I've ruined relationships. Broken hearts. Caused terrible situations that I don't think I'd even be able to hold my sanity through myself if I were in different shoes. To make things worse, every instance ends with a fight, and I believe it is initiated by my own jealousy each time. If not a fight, it's an argument, or an overly dramatic final word. Each girl I've been involved with I wound up never speaking to again.

**mini TL;DR** I make people cheat and then get mad when they reject me.

examples:

- My second girlfriend: had a boyfriend of 3 years. He was 2 years older, so they naturally had some tension. I sensed that, swooped in, and she went from friend to SO to girlfriend. We dated for a year. She ended up getting back with him after.
- Next was a hippie chick I met through protest. She had a boyfriend, and believed in free love and all that bullshit, but once I actually put that into play, she felt guilty, broke up with her boyfriend of a little over a year, and went out with me for 3 months until I left her without giving reason. My own insecurity got to me. This happens often.

*Skipping ahead a bit...*

- A girl I knew through university. Her boyfriend was mentally and physically abusive. I'm a good person, besides all this shit here... so I tried to convince her that she can be strong and can kick him out of her life. She did it. You guessed it, we got together for a few weeks. She left me this time. Sadly, the guy has her around his finger. Knowing that tears me apart... but I tried my best and fucked it up when I probably could have helped her further had I not exploited her.
- Next girl is the best friend of the last. She's been going out with a guy for about 6 months at this point. Her and I have known each other for 2 years. We've been great friends. We had so many nice times together. But when I started to notice that she was seeking my attention more and more often, due to her boyfriend always busy as he's in medical school, I swooped in. We went to the movies. I didn't do this too quick. I genuinely liked her. We started just flirting, then holding hands, then I'd kiss her cheek goodbye at the end of the day. Then she started coming over my place.. and so on. Finally, the guilt kicked in for her, and she cut things off. Self-defence kicked in for me, and I told her I never want to see or hear from her again. I lost an amazing friend.

- The most recent girl actually changed my life. With her, I could admit everything. All of this. She really saw me. We began as just friends. Originally, we'd been acquaintances a few years ago, but recently rekindled the friendship. The feeling was the same for her; I saw her like nobody else saw her before. We had all these disgusting problems in common for one. Naturally, we grew onto each other. Needless to say, she had a boyfriend. One of a year and 6 months. Regardless, we ended up getting closer, and slowly started really seeing each other behind his back. Skip ahead, we had sex in the end. It was after that, though, that her guilt kicked in, he saw a hickie, and they started having trouble. She isn't speaking to me. I know she won't. I know through a mutual friend though that they broke up, got back together, once more, and now I'm unsure. But she hates my guts. As ridiculous as it may sound, I don't really understand this particular case. She saw me, I saw her. She told me he could do nothing that I could. I don't understand how she could say goodbye to me, but it's over. That's that, as far as this paragraph goes.

**Side note: I did, or believed that I did, genuinely feel for every girl that I mention. Once we started seeing each other, the devil in me was nowhere to be found, as I was getting the validation--just what I wanted. However, as they were all in previous commitments, things inevitably went bad, and that's when the fights/arguments/drama occurred.**

I don't know how to end this. I guess that's because it's a confession.

**TL;DR** I'm insecure and so I exploit/take advantage of girls in lengthy, however unstable, relationships; all for my own validation. I'm that guy who ruins your relationships.

Thoughts?

Edit: I'm very open to criticism. I'm not asking for you to tell me that everything's going to be okay. I know that I'm an asshole and a lot of people hate me or would hate me. I want your honest thoughts, please! That would help me most.

Edit 2: I'm considering expanding this to incorporate how this whole problem effects me, personally. Partly to make it clear that I'm not a sociopath, and partly to confess to even further issues that nobody knows about.
&lt; did it.

My whole life, I've been socially awkward. Not exactly antisocial, but very uneasy and unsure how to act in front of people--even my own family and closest friends. This stretches into my dating life. I find it very hard to talk to a girl and spark up a friendship. Same goes for guys. Anyone. Here's the key: I like to be romantic. I'm that kind of person. It's very easy for me, and I can really express myself if I'm having an intimate moment with someone. What's the trouble? I can't get in that kind of situation. Not ethically or honestly. I'm a parasite--I leech off of decaying relationships and make them my own. Because it's easy, at least for me. To be clear, I know how morally wrong and disgusting this is. That's why it gets to me. Phony or stolen relationships making up my love life, I'm consistently disgusted with myself. I don't do this for enjoyment.. I do it for validation. I see that this problem will likely always be a problem, and I'll only end up hurting myself, and more importantly, others, if I continue. But all I want is happiness. Knowing that I'm stuck in this, I know that happiness is something that I will never achieve. Recently, I've been sitting on the train tracks alone at night, drunk, smoking cigarettes (my two scapegoats). I'm terrified of death, mostly because I know that my friends and family will be blown away, confused. They'd never understand, because they don't know this. That, and one other thing, are keeping me from offing myself; that is a gloomy hope that I'll find someone who none of this comes into effect with. Maybe I'll be able to overcome this with the right person. Maybe they'll *really* love me, and I'll *really* love them. 


Don't even get me started on my dead-end life outside of all of this...

The culture around sports teams, especially successful sport teams is disgusting, and all forgiving for any player that might do something like, I don't know, rape someone. I couldn't handle the idea that the police offer I was looking in the eye to tell my story would be denying in in the back of their head. It made me sick to think that if I dared to tell anyone what happened it would be met with instant doubt, and overwhelming support for that poor, innocent athlete I was trying to slander. Worst of all though, are the people that you know would kind of believe you, but your rapists athletic abilities mean far more to them than the crime he committed. 

It was a long time ago, but Steubenville case has been raising a lot of angry, hateful feelings that have been on simmer inside of me for years. I'm absolutely defensive as I write this, so let me start the real story by saying fuck you. I was drunk. My top was low cut because I did want attention from boys. But I wasn't so blackout drunk that I don't remember saying no, and just because I wanted people to look does mean they had consent to do more than I wanted them to. 
 
I wanted to makeout with the football star. I did consent to that. I willingly went to that empty room with him. I absolutely did try to give him a hickey. I let him go under the bra. However I did not give him permission to put his fingers inside of me. I said no the second his hand got too high up on my thigh for my taste. I stopped kissing and tried to pull away. He didn't let me. He didn't stop at fingers. 

I'm doing okay now, but I'll probably never forget. It will always linger in the back of my head. I don't want it to, but it will always make me fear telling a man no when I've reached the end of my comfort zone. I do it, but who knows if he'll respect that? So far, I've been lucky. I've built up and had successful, fulfilling, and committed sexual relationships. But somewhere in my subconscious, I fear that I'll meet another who won't take that's enough as answer. 

Good athletes deserve praise for their performance, but this free pass for everything is is disturbing and disgusting. They're human too, and they can be bad people. What they can do on a court/field/whatfuckingever should not excuse their actions elsewhere. My town was not even particularly small, but I still felt internal pressure not to dare accuse their best HS football player of anything. It always ends the same.

I was living halfway across the country and decided to go home after I realized I was really losing it. I began hearing voices. The television would talk to me and I had 3 people at any given time sitting cartoon-anatomy style in chairs in my head telling me to do things and who I could trust. at any given time they were kurt cobain or a boy I had a crush on for years or a guy I used to work with or my long deceased grandfather. I also thought my cat was trying to tell me things. I finally went to live with my mother telling no one anything because even at my most unhinged I recognized that telling anyone would result in at best going to a doctor (which I loath) or getting psychiatric treatment.  I was absolutely convinced there were 3 levels in people comprised of angels and demons and that greek gods from mythology inhabited everyone and were looped through native american folklore in a way I can only barely remember enough to comprehend unless I really tried which I am reluctant to.  Essentially every mythology or folklore I ever read interwove and made a very very detailed web of heightened belief in my head. I was never diagnosed after about a year I was together enough to get a job..for the next few years I still would have conversations with the people in my head and to this day still struggle to disregard what they say.  No one ever tells me to kill anyone or myself and they don't try to warn me that someone else is killing me anymore.  I'm aware thanks to google fu that this is probably some schizophrenia related illness but to be honest I have it under such control now that what I have left I enjoy and I don't want it gone. The most bizarrely comical of it all is that when I wasn't afraid of being assasinated it was actually pretty wonderful.  Feeling connected and powerful and part of something greater thats rooted through the universe.  The part I hold on to the strongest still is this belief that there are really only a handful of types of people in the world (again, based largely in greek mythology...we're talking hestias and perspehones, athena's and zeus and hades etc) and all of them have large contributing factors as to the nature of the person..and it really helps me get a line on people I think.

This morning, feeling super tired, I went up to the overhead seats and almost sat one a lady who was not dressed for cycling, and I assumed was a pedestrian. Now, normally what I do is ask the person politely how far they are going, so that I might be able to take their seat after. There were other seats available but I found myself sort of miffed that she was taking the more comfortable seat. In short, I became a huge baby about the whole thing. I asked her how far she was going and she looke dat me, horrified.

""Where do you get off?"" I asked.

She just stared at me.

""This is a bike car,"" I said. ""I am just wondering if I can have that seat after you leave.""

She continued to stare at me, and I soon realized that she didn't speak English. I gave up in frustration and went to the back, muttering, ""It's a bike car,"" just like all the assholes who do that sort of thing.

the conductor heard this and laid into me, which I deserved. ""She has every right to be on the train as you do! She bought a ticket and you don't have the right to kick her out of her seat.""

Too tired and embarrassed and tired to argue, I nodded and said, ""You're right.""

Meanwhile the conductor apologized to the lady in Spanish, I assume explaining that she had the right to sit wherever she wants.

I powerlift. Most of my friends and family think I do it to better myself. My therapist believes it helps my depression and anxiety, and it does. However, there's one thing no one knows about me. I have an extreme amount of anger, and if I didn't lift I wouldn't be able to control it.

I was in a six year relationship that ended three years ago and I'm only 22. I'm struggling to get over it because I suck with women and I keep going back to my ex in vain attempts to reconnect. This creates an intense anger at myself and my ex. I also have been unemployed for almost a year and live with my parents, which doesn't help my situation. I struggle to control my weight because I binge eat. If wronged, I will hold a grudge until the end of time. I consume an unhealthy amount of caffeine and energy supplements to make me feel alive.

Don't get me wrong though. It's not like if I didn't lift weights I would murder everyone. I would never act out physically, but I would more likely sabotage and destroy every relationship I have with my friends and family. The saddest part of it is I enjoy being angry. I'd rather feel angry than nothing at all.

Ever since I discovered my dad's porno tape collection at 12 I've become increasingly consumed by pornography. No girlfriend in highschool, but my porn habit kept growing. I began to realize it might be affecting me, but I thought it would solve by itself eventually. I thought by 30 I would be emotionally stable, confident and happy.

I am now 29 and living two lives. On the outside I am a nice, quiet and caring boyfriend. In my secret life I go on masturbation binges, I visit erotic massage parlors, strip clubs and visit prostitutes. The last three have been going on for more than two years. The sex life with my girlfriend of six years has been on a steady decline, and is now close to non-existant. She caught me watching porn a couple of times, it made her feel horrible and I promised I would cut down on it but I haven't. My secret life has been driving us apart. She feels unattractive because I have lost interest in her sexually.

After every binge I feel like shit. I've been getting more and more anxious. I've started going late to work every day to stay at home to masturbate. I've done it with my girlfriend sleeping in the same room. I now feel anxious for most of my waking hours and I avoid interacting with people because of my anxiety / shame. I have become a chronic procrastinator at work. I am losing the ability to enjoy the things I used to enjoy. I know this isn't healthy, moral, fair to her or in anyone's interest. I've tried to stop but it's been getting worse.

A psychiatrist gave me anti-depressants. They muted my anxiety and replaced it with indifference. I lost my libido but not my habits.

I have never, ever told another soul that this has happened.
About a year and a half ago, I was working an easy overnight job where I basically sat at a desk with a laptop, in a building, alone for 8 hours. Its not my proudest moment, but I used to trawl through the random chat site Omegle to pass the time. 
 One night, I connected to a girl (both of us, only using text). For whatever reason, maybe boredom, maybe loneliness, I lied about who I was. It wasn't all lies, though. The only thing I changed about myself was my location, and my appearance. Age, profession, hobbies, life experiences, all of that was true. We started talking. It got sexual that first night, I convinced her to get on camera. This girl was was gorgeous. I had had previous relationships, but this girl was miles out of my league. The last type of girl you would ever expect to find doing seedy things on the Internet. She had a bit of social anxiety, and I think that contributed to it. I should note here that throughout the entire year that we spoke, I did not show my face or go on video in any way. Only text. I found random pictures to send that were of the first ""attractive"" dude I found on social media site. First time I had ever done something like that. I had various excuses as to why I couldn't show my face. I imagine deep down that she knew, too. It was sexual almost every night after that, but not just sex.

I told myself that I wouldn't get attached, but I did. We talked almost every single night for over a year. Her always on video, me always typing. I became addicted to spending my long hours alone at work, and later school, looking into the eyes of this beautiful girl every night. Told each other everything. Talked about everything. Helped each other with everything. I fell in ""love"", or the closest you can get to love with a video screen.
After nearly a year of this, she became suspicious of why I could not show my face and broke it off with me. We broke off contact. Nearly a month later, we have a tearful reunion. I come clean about everything. She obviously breaks off any sort of romantic situation between the two of us. Still wants to be friends, I am immeditaly friend zoned.I Skype with her, show my face. We still talk sometimes, text, the occasional phone call. She's a kind, caring girl.
But, like I said earlier. This girl was beautiful. I'm not bad looking, I've had my fair share of partners and relationships, but this girl was still that special kind of beautiful, where you just kind of know she's unattainable. We talk a few times a week.
She has a new boyfriend now, and I guess this was a lengthy way for me to say that it's really fucking me up. I know I have no right to even fathom having anything with this girl at all. What I did was a vile thing, and I know that.
But every single night, I think of her. Of what it used to be like. 
But most of all I just think about what would have happened if I hadn't had that whim to lie a year ago. If I had just been myself. Where would things be now if I had just been myself?

They only concern themselves with dating Jewish girls (although they only act Jewish when it's convenient for them), they seem to mostly go where the Jews go, and often I am let out of certain get togethers along with my other, mutual non-Jewish friends. Seeing this behavior all the time really disgusts me because I don't care what religion someone is (even though my friends are often the most unJewish Jews), and yet when they only seem interested in their own kind, I sort of feel like I'm not welcome. In fact I am starting to hate my friends for this behavior. It's making me an outsider, and as they get more and more Jew-exclusive (especially with their choice in favorite actors and singers) I feel more and more like the ""Jews stick together"" stereotype is true. I don't want to have racist, stereotypical thoughts about others but the more I am pushed away in favor of new Jewish friends, the more it seems true.

I feel alienated and I have seen many non-Jews in our circle go their separate ways. I am one of the few non-Jews left in this circle and it makes me feel like I don't belong... especially when every time we hang out and someone new hanging with us happens to be Jewish. I feel like they are hinting they don't want me to be part of it anymore. There are fewer calls, fewer emails, texts, and even my Facebook seems emptier. In fact, seeing what they're up to on Facebook has revealed all the things they've done together. All the Jews in my group are so close. I don't know... I put 12 years into these friendships.

I grew up in the midwest, had two parents, had two sisters, one who I often clash heads with, and one I love dearly. I did very well in school and played soccer throughout high school. My social life was fine and I did okay when it comes to dating. I got a scholarship to a college that's out of state, which I gladly took advantage of. I got my degree in business management and decided to stay in the state I attended school in. I got a job at a large manufacturing company that pays very well. I started out as the assistant regional manager, but, after a year and a half of working in the company, I was promoted after the manager that came before me retired. I still worked part time at the job I took in college, which was doing various things at a country club. I made plenty of friends, and dated a few guys, and some girls here and there, but something was always missing. 

I've always had a ""fat fetish,"" though, the idea of becoming fat myself was always seemed unrealistic. As someone who has been of normal weight her entire life, gaining mass amounts of weight just always seemed to be something I dreamed of, until, I met my current boyfriend. We met in a bar, which seems a bit old fashioned nowadays. He's pretty overweight, which is what I look for in a partner. We hit it off and after a few nights out, we were dating. At some point I told him of my fetish, and as it turned out, we had that in common. He asked why I'd never gained weight myself, and reminded me that there was big money in it. I told him the truth, that I was afraid of what my family would think of me. Fast forward to Christmas of that year, and I tell my family that I've joined the army and won't be around much anymore. I suppose they all thought it was odd, but, no one questioned it. I won't go into what I did business wise, but, I sorted everything out and have a consistent source of income that does far more than just pays the bills.

I started out making YouTube videos as I began gaining, seeing as though I doubted that I would make any money in the early stages of weight gain. It didn't take me long to get to 200 pounds, and things were smooth sailing from there. It had been almost a year and a half since I'd spoken to any of my immediate family, and nearly two and a half since I lied about joining the army until my younger sister texted me, asking if I was around. She's always been really fat, even since we were kids. Our parents always ridiculed her for it, pressuring her to lose weight. Since she's the last person who would judge me, I agreed to meet with her for lunch. She was confused and surprised when I told her what was going on, but, she respected my decisions. We caught up and went our seperate ways, though, we've kept in closer touch.

It's been four years since I've seen my parents, and I've stopped missing them. My real father died when I was really young, and the man my mother married was a total asshole. My now husbands family is very kind and seems to like me quite a bit. I've gained over 200 pounds and now I weigh around 360 lbs. I make money on several camsites for bbw &amp; ssbbw models.

Sometimes I feel like I use my mental illnesses as an excuse. However, there's been days where I couldn't even drag myself out of bed in the morning. It's been rough. Camming has been the only job that makes me feel happy, and it's the only job I've ever been able to get up for.

I began smoking nearly nine years ago when I was eleven. I didn't smoke a lot between the ages of eleven to fourteen but enough to get high and have s Good time.

When I was fourteen, I began dating the town stoner and things changed. I started smoking everyday. 

I'd smoke on probation, telling myself the drug test wouldn't come soon and I'd get clean before it. Even though I faced a six month sentence if I vane up dirty. I'd tell myself jobs won't test that, but of course most do, so now I'm a stripper.  The only job I could get.

I've risked my freedom, my high school, my life for weed. I don't even get high anymore and I still waste money and smoke it. I'm scared to quit my job because college students can't really afford weed without a job that makes a min of a hundred a night.


I'm seriously addicted. I've searched the floor for crumbs, searched throw all pockets and bags for just the smallest taste of weed. I've even smoked durst (weed left over after a   vape session) several times even though it almost made me vomit with every hit. Its normalcy to me now. A friend. I can't sleep without it.

I don't know how to get help r without telling people that I'm severally, life affectingly addicted to a plant that is supposedly nonaddictive. I actually feel like I'm betraying weed by even saying this even though I have all the classic signs of an addiction.

I changed all my plans during my travels. she felt the same way, we spent a lot of time together.

one night we were both drunk and had sex without a condom. the next morning she was a bit worried that I might have HIV and I'll admit I was concerned of the opposite ( this area of the world is endemic so it was a bit frightening)

so I suggested we got tested together. results negative on both counts (neither of us were surprised but its nice to be sure of the other)

but I digress.

so we keep seeing each other and the use of protection wasn't as solid as it should have been.

she pointed out that she had been with her ex for 2 years and never got pregnant,

i wasn't too worried because it took two years of trying when I was with my ex years and years earlier before she got pregnant - and I knew i _had_ had lazy sperm.

well as all things do my holidays came to an end.

And I had to return home (having already booked my next set of holidays to go back and see her)

I left the day before her period was due - (and if you doubt things - I was there the last time her period arrived, and I mean eye witness heh)

it didn't come.

so we waited for a while longer.

and a while longer.

and it still didn't come.

I told her not to worry.

I told her I would look after her no matter what.

she already has two kids and doesn't want more until I can be with her forever.

I sat through the scans  via skype and looked at the little acorn on screen. 

I told her no matter what I'd be here for her.

unfortunately it'd take at least two years before I could begin the process of bringing her to my country... 

because I'm married and it would take that long for a divorce to go through.

and I couldn't find a job in her country fast enough.

and it'll be six months before I'm back there (coincidentally - i would have been there for the due date)

so yesterday she had a scan at the hospital and was given the meds.

today she went in and had the baby terminated.

I'm now crying because I don't agree with abortion - on a personal level, I also don't agree with taking away a persons right to choose.

when I was staunchly atheist I realised that aborting was removing the only chance at existence that someone would have - and if that had happened to me I would have never had the blessing of concioussness.

these days I'm more open minded but have no strong religious beliefs (just that I know that I know nothing )

but I was really preparing to drop everything in my life, sell everything do everything I could to be with her.

and I still am. but my second son or daughter will never be born, and I can't tell anyone.

because I'm a cunt who cheated constantly on his wife while away overseas, who got a girl pregnant and now only feels shitty from the selfish reason that there was a child there that I'll never get to see, hold, help with homework, help grow and maybe be a postive influence on the world.


my love overseas is happy to wait, and very practical - she didn't want to be un-partnered and having another baby with 2 kids already (school age) because she could not do it all, and I couldn't give her the garantee that I would be there in person yet.

so she will wait until I can be there in person, then we will have children.

and thats what I'm going to do. and yet I feel nothing for my wife - except I want a way to break up with her that hurts the least.


TL;DR - I'm an uncaring cock who got another chick pregnant whilst married. I want to be with the other chick overseas and not with my wife. chick I got pregnant had a (albeit logical and practical reasons) abortion. I feel like shit because I was looking forward to meeting my child.

We ended up cuddling for a few more hours.


I was so conflicted and was unsure of how to proceed. We slowly began to stop talking even though if it weren't for the HIV, I wouldn't have.

Even aside from the fact that dirty talking and sexting guys as a girl (it really does nothing for me when I'm honest about my gender) is my favorite sexual thrill even just chatting about bullshit and my ""life"" is easier and more fluid as my female self than it is for my real self. Imagine that, I actually have an easier time describing and talking about a life that an imaginary version of myself lives than about the life I actually live (""live"") every day. 

**tl;dr**: sad, lonely loser who's more comfortable speaking to other human beings assuming the role a flirty teenage girl than as my own self.

It began a week before my wedding.  My, then future, Mother in Law invited me over to discuss the future.  My wife told me to go and, clearly in the know, told me to listen closely as this was to be an significant evening.  After some generic wedding plan talks she asked me to sit down for an important conversation.  In it I learned about the semi-formal matriarchy practiced by her family.  She presented herself as mater-familius and I was joining them, not starting an independent unit.  Were I to not accept her status (and before long my wifes, and before long all the females of the family), it was all off.  Here is my biggest shame about this.  They are wealthy and a part of my desire for my wife is the comfort ensured by the marriage.  I admit it and am ashamed.  This was a significant factor in my submission.  After about an hour of telling me how it is she said something Ill never forget verbatim.  ""Dale (pseudonym), Its time I see you naked.  stand up and undress completely"".  I did as I was told and from then on Ive never disobeyed a direct order from my Mother in Law.

 Once a month I (after church) spend the day 'helping Grandma around the house'.  In reality, this is the day of my monthly accounting.  I undress and stand naked while she relates her observations and hearsay regarding my behavior/performance the previous month.  I do self-criticism and we agree on any discipline I deserve.  She spanks me bare over her knee with a hairbrush.  If She wants my emotional surrender she can get me to cry and beg.  I often do.  Also, she uses corner time, mouth soaping and other juvenile discipline.  I remain completely undressed until she releases me with a scolding lecture about my expectations for the next month.  I go home, my wife tends to my behind and life goes on.  

All of the extended family lives in the Both burbs of Chicago.  No one is allowed to move away.  My one brother in law is spanked as well but weve never gotten it at the same time.

The following is an explanation of what happened. None of the following is an excuse. There is no excuse.

We'd been drinking at a friend's house, having a great time. There was a relationship between her and I, we're very close and still are. The night went on and on, and pretty soon it was time to go to bed. She came into bed with me and I started touching her in a manner that I'd touched her countless times. This was consensual.

What changed was when she expressed some reluctance, half awake. I heard her entirely. I knew every word and I told her to be quiet, that we were going to do it anyway. I pulled her underwear off and she sort of mumbled again, but I just shushed her. I was fully aware of what I was doing and I thought it would be okay. I got her underwear off and she said no a third time. I did it anyway. She didn't really move or say much, and I can't be certain whether or not she was even conscious at that point, but I finished, rolled onto my back, and all I could think was ""I just raped her.""

The next day was as if nothing had happened. She wasn't acting strangely towards me at all. We've been together for years before that, and many months after. To this day I don't know if she even knows what I did, but the fact that I know is enough.

I want to say I'm not a bad person and I want somebody to believe me, but if I were telling this story to my past self, I wouldn't believe me either. Regardless, I'm not a bad person. I do kind things for people, I work hard, I provide for a very loving family. I'm NEVER violent to people, raising my voice only on the extremely rare occasion.

I used to hit my cat and dog. About three years ago, I did it. My grandma had gotten a new cat. It was about 2 years old. It bit me one day, and when I was home alone. I don't know what came over me. I hit it. Again and again. It ran into my bathtub, where I continued to hit it. It defected in fear. After that, it became so mean to everyone my grandma had to put it down because it constantly bit people. 
My dog happened more than once. I once hit him across the face so hard my hand stung. He was so scared of a hand being raised for a long time after and my parents had no idea why. And I had to hide it.
Since that year, I have thought about suicide, come close to committing it only to back out because I know it would tear my family apart. But I can't tell them about this because they would never forgive me. I can't forgive me. 
Everyday I whisper to my dog that I'm sorry. I am so. so. sorry. He seems to love me more than ever now, he listens to basically only me and sleeps with me at night and cuddles with me constantly. I shower him with love in hopes that he can forgive me one day, and I pray that he isn't doing it out of pure terror that I might abuse him one day. 

I'm scared. I'm so scared to ever own my own pet, to have children, to ever get angry again. I used to want to be a vet - help innocent animals. Not hurt them! How could I ever hit something so defenceless. I sicken myself. I hate myself. 
Everyday I spiral into a depression knowing I've done that. I haven't done it since that year (although it happened a few times during that year) but I hate the fact that the thought even crossed my mind. That I followed through with it.

I wish I could see a therapist, but I wouldn't be able to afford one anyways. I also have some part of me that thinks I don't deserve it, that I should suffer in my guilt and rot in hell forever. And I believe it.

I like boys that are 19 or 20. 
 
My friend and I went clubbing the other night and I chose a place I knew would be full of boys. We stood there sipping a cocktail when a group of boys approached us. They wanted to know if our table was taken since we were standing next to a table not using the chairs. So they sat there and started talking amongst themselves. I immediately felt a rush. There were about 5 or 6 of them. I could feel they wanted to talk to us but were too intimidated. Finally one of them approached us. A nice looking boy. Blonde hair, nice smile, not to tall and wearing a t-shirt and white pants. He asked me if I was feeling bored and we started talking. He was 21 and very eager to impress me. I sat down and sat him down next to me. My friend continued the conversation and I started to feel his body. First the back. It was firm. He is still young so no fat. Just muscles. His belly was firm too. I felt his face. He was shaven but you could feel his beard was still new and soft. No older man can ever shave so soft. His legs had little hair too. I pulled his shirt up. Just a little hair on his belly and his chest. I felt his cock. It was rock hard.  
My friend kept asking him all these questions. Where do you go to college, what do you study, what do you want to do in your life.... he was answering like a good boy while I was touching him all over.  
Finally I took him outside. 

I made him take his pants off. 

I wanted to see his cock. 

It was big and very hard. 

I told him to masturbate for me. 
I wanted him to touch my pussy but he couldn't figure out where to stick his finger so he kept caressing my pubic hair.  

He tried to pull my boobs out of my bra but had no luck either.
  
At this point my little boy became frustrated.  

He was pulling on me wanting me to suck it or to let him fuck me. 

He was thrusting against my body. 

But I decided not to let him cum. 
I made him put his clothes back on and go back to the club. 
I licked his earlobe for a bit and left.

Now I’m just sorry I didn’t fuck him. 


I’m sad because I’d like to be rich enough to be able to take boys clubbing, buy them drinks and make them feel totally like my toy. But I’m not and probably never will be. 



I hate that I feel this way. I like the feeling of power I guess. later I feel disgusted with myself.

It helps to talk about it, even if no one is listening.

I'll start from the beginning. Growing up I had a terrible relationship with my father. He was very verbally and physically abusive towards me. My parents weren't divorced or separated so I lived with him. He worked nights and my mom during the day, so I spent a majority of the time with him. We never joked around or anything like that and the only time we ever communicated was when he was punishing me. His favorite line to use was ""I'm your father, not your buddy"". I also had a younger brother, which he treated immensely better. This created jealousy towards my brother, which has hurt our relationship as well. I just never understood why I wasn't good enough... Why he didn't want me. I spent a majority of my childhood trying to make him proud, to no avail. Because of all the abuse I was a very quiet kid during school, with the mentality of don't speak unless spoken to. He was also in the military. The physical abuse didn't start right away. At first it was just spanking but the more my mom worked, the more he took advantage of the situation. Eventually, it led to punching and kicking me. He's not a small guy either, he's about 6ft 1 and 260lbs. I took it all and never told my mother. I just wanted him to like me, just one time to tell me he loved me. The physical abuse stopped when I got big enough to finally defend myself. When I was 17, my parents finally got a divorced. I was starting to accept the fact that there was no chance of a relationship with him but I did assume that maybe things would get better with this divorce and maybe we'll talk a little more. The opposite happened, he completely disappeared and I didn't hear a word from him in almost two years. All this was while he lived maybe 10 minutes away. He was still sending my brother money and hanging out with him, which crushed me. My depression came back and I felt empty.

Fast forward to how this has effected me today. Feeling empty, I saw woman as a possible fix for me. I fully understand that I use them for my selfish reasons. I don't use them for sex, for me sex is irrelevant. It's everything else I get that fuels me to do what I do. I love being told that they love me, I love the cuddling, just the fact that they want me around and want me with them. I say ""I love you too"" knowing full well I don't. Those words are empty to me. Eventually I get bored with it and start to subconsciously sabotage it till i'm completely alone. I then get depress again and the vicious cycle  begins to repeat itself. I don't know how to stop it and all I want is to be loved, yet I don't open myself up and am pretty emotionally dead because of my childhood. I just go through the motions and tell them what I think they want to hear. I'm also a proud fool so going to talk to a professional is out of the question. I'm afraid that i'm just going to end up alone because I never really allow myself to open up with my feelings.

Nothing passed that. But enough to make me feel like a terrible person, not to mention husband.

I hate myself for allowing that to even happen.

EDIT: For the few that commented or cared for an update...I just finished telling her everything. Everything went a lot better than expected. Her reaction was a lot more calm and level-headed than my mind imagined it would be. She knows it would never have happened without alcohol involved...so I will be taking a break from alcohol...and from staying with them for quite some time.

Thank you for your comments and advice...no matter what view you had.

**EDIT 2**

Clearly there are 2 extreme and passionate opposing viewpoints on this. I would like to say though that I know my wife very well. I know how much she loves me and how much she cares for me and vice versa. I TOLD her because I LOVE her. When I vowed to be loyal at our wedding...I meant it, but regardless I broke that promise. She handled it well because I was sincere and didn't want to keep it from her. I was crying like a little girl before I even got the words out because I was so ashamed that I could hurt such a wonderful person. This morning we were laughing and couldn't tell each other enough how much we loved one another. I didn't tell her out of selfishness to help my own guilt, I still feel just guilty about the act. I see this as only helping our relationship now. One of the first things she said was that she was glad I told her...and that I should always be able to tell her anything good or bad. So, take from this what you will.

Maybe keeping it to yourself works for some of you...even it was just once...I have a different thought process however. 

Also, in regards to 2 specific areas: I'm reading up on not drinking anymore and am looking to practically apply it. She's going to help me with it because if I can do something like that that I never thought I would do...it could happen again.

Second, that really is all that happened. It may seem hard to believe...but why would I lie on a throwaway account in some far corner of the internet?

*I apologize for the horrendous grammar and run-on sentences, I'm at work and after thinking about doing this for months I just wanted to get this over with*.

My brother is 3 years older than me and was always popular in school whereas I was a *nerd*, so anytime my brother wanted to hang out with me was **awesome** back when I was 8-10 years old in elementary school, even if it WAS in the middle of the night. 
We would play 'pretend Street Fighter' with our hands as characters or talk late into the night about whatever it is 10 and 13 year olds talk about. I would think it was **SO** cool to have our own little secret time together. I should also add that whatever he asked me for throughout the day *he got*, if he wanted a drink or wanted someone to play video games, I would comply. If he wanted to do something I didn't want to do, it didn't take long for him to get me to do it.. after all he was my cool older brother and *what young sibling doesn't adore their elder at that age*?

---
When I was in 5th grade I developed **very early**. I was a **B cup** by the time I graduated elementary school and it wasn't long after that my brother would wake me up in the middle of the night to hang out.... *for new reasons*. To preface this I should mention that I was definitely hormonal too, I remember humping my stuffed animals in bed or putting a pillow between my legs and grinding it because *it felt funny*. 

---
One night he woke me up and told me he really needed a favor from me. He showed me his hard-on and told me I had to help him get rid of it. Although I didn't get 'the talk' until I was 13, I'd accidentally watched Red Shoe Diaries and *not-accidentally* watched cable porn at my aunt's house when everyone was asleep.... I knew in my gut what he was asking me to do was *taboo and dirty and wrong*.... but somehow he managed to convince me like he had all my life.... *to do as he asked*. I **do** remember him saying **'this is called incest and it's totally common'**.
He had me sit on his lap and grind his crotch as he played with my breasts and soon had me on my knees in the dark room. I can still remember what I *saw* in the moonlight, I remember what it *smelled* like, what it *tasted* like and how genuinely repulsed but intrigued I was by this reptilian-looking thing I'd known nothing of my entire life. It's like I knew what I was doing was wrong but it made me feel *funny* like the pillow grinding did and I wasn't completely sure why. He never tried to penetrate my vagina, only had me give him blow-jobs and play with my breasts. 

---
This nightly ritual lasted a year or so. **At age 14 he lost his virginity to a 23 year old woman.** Back *then* of course we thought this was *super cool*, now I realize what a *disgustingly disturbed bitch* she must have been. When I was 12 and he was 15 and my best friend would sleep over we would have mid-night truth or dare games which would basically end up as my friend and I being dared to kiss or touch each other and my brother getting to dry hump or make out with her. She had a crush on him so of course she'd comply. My brother and I never did anything in front of her bc,. I mean,. *gross right?* We were brother and sister. 
In turn when **I** would sleep over *her* house, we'd play this **same** game with her younger brother (he was one year younger). I realize now her brother didn't know what was going on and I feel *horribly* guilty about having done that to him at such a young age. 

---
Nothing happened again until I was about 17 and he was 20. Him and his girlfriend had broken up and he was upset.... he came into my room and after crying on my shoulder started playing with my boobs which were now well into a **DD**. The next night he asked me if I wanted to go into our backyard pool in the middle of the night (it was summer) and I thought *AWESOME! Midnight dip!*. We went into the pool and he dared me to take my clothes off after which he had me stand in front of him and I felt his hard on go between my thighs: he never penetrated my vagina, maybe because I was still a virgin, but he thrust alongside my labia and in between my thighs until he came. 
That was the last time. That girl and him got back together and now he is married to her and they have two beautiful children and I live with my amazing boyfriend whom I hope to marry. I guess I should mention that I'm now in my mid-20's.

---
This whole ordeal doesn't really come up in my mind often, but reading some confessions and AMA's here has *raised some old demons*. When I was 8 I was inappropriately touched but thankfully not further abused by a family member who we later found out was *abusing some of my cousins*, this background with my brother, what I put my best friend's brother though, being attacked by a pedophile online when I was 14..... and I just think about how **fucking crazy** it all is. 

---
I suffered manic depression (or it was called manic depression back when they were diagnosing me, now I'm sure it's on it's 205th term/definition) and borderline personality disorder in my early 20's. I was treated and went to therapy for **years**, I've had many best friends, I didn't mention this but we have a little sister who is 8 years younger than me who basically knows everything there is to know about me, my boyfriend and I have the most open and trusting relationship ever....... and I have never..... EVER and WILL never tell **anyone** about this **for as long as I live**. How could YOU ever tell your significant other that the first time you gave oral was to your SIBLING at the tender age of **10**?

---
I wonder if my brother remembers or ever thinks about it.. I wonder if he ever feels *guilty*. We've never addressed it. If you're wondering if I think he would ever abuse anyone else, that is a big whopping **no**. He was a popular kid in high school so he got all the poon he wanted. My sister, *I pray I'm right when I say* was never messed with. I'm not afraid for my niece because I don't think he's a pervert so much as he was a **young, hormone-ridden boy** who's closest confidant happened to be a naive girl with big boobs who he had unlimited access to. I'm not defending what he did with me but I don't think he's done anything inappropriate with anyone else. *But who knows right? *

Now that I'm older and in a serious relationship and the topic of having *children* comes up, I can't help but think sometimes about how ignorant I might be to their secret lives the way my parents were **completely** ignorant to mine. **I can't FATHOM** looking at my beautiful 10 or 12 year old little boy's or daughter's face and think that they might be a sexual **predator** or *victim* of some kind. I want them in a fucking **glass bubble** until they're at least **20**.

I know you posted the thread about Adderall over a month ago, but I had to pm you even if the chance of you reading this is slight. Your situation sounds almost EXACTLY (frighteningly so...) like my situation last year. Here is my story and I hope you can take something away from it.


I started taking it without a prescription in order to motivate myself to work hard for the summer school classes I was taking. It was incredible. I felt as though for the first time in my life I had begun to reach my full potential. I got A's in all my classes and even had a teacher recommend I take graduate courses during the fall.


Since buying consistently from a friend is expensive, time consuming, and even a tad embarrassing, I decided to meet with a doctor for an evaluation to get a prescription. After probably one of the best bullshitting performances I'd ever put on, I was prescribed 20mgs twice a day and everything started looking up for me all at once. I was losing weight (oh yeah, probably should mention, I've struggled with various types of eating disorders for most of my life: bouts of anorexia, binge eating disorder, and bulimia), doing well in school, and had even improved most of my relationships with family and friends. I stayed within the recommended dose for a little while at first but I quickly built up a tolerance. I got too afraid to ask my doctor for a higher dose in fear he'd find out I wasn't really ADHD. So I took more and more and ran out early, pretty much becoming a sleeping, gluttonous human blob when I was without it.


I completely relate to what you said about not being able to get out of bed without popping a pill. If I didn't have any, there was no way in hell I was leaving my bed until 5 pm so I could eat every piece of edible matter within a 50 foot radius, and then plop right back to sleep (unfortunately most of it was my roommates' food, so they were constantly pissed at me). Consequently, I would miss a lot of class/homework on the days I didn't have it. Shit started goin' down.


Not only did I feel like a shell of a human being, but my grades were suffering, I was gaining weight, and my roommates were frustrated with my uncontrollable binging. How do you solve this problem? More Adderall is clearly the right decision! I started writing fake prescriptions in my therapist's name. I would go through a month's supply in a week, sometimes less. I didn't really care though because as far as I was concerned, I had an unlimited amount of Adderall.


As I'm sure you're aware, coming down from Adderall is BRUTAL. I would feel so dysphoric I would often have dark, depressing and sometimes suicidal thoughts. On top of hardly eating, I also didn't sleep much, and if I did, it was for 14-20 hours straight. The longest I ever went without sleep was a full 3 days, but I frequently went two nights in a row (at least once a week). Hallucinations are not as cool when they're not on purpose. 

While in the intense state of paranoia I was beginning to know too well, I decided to research what the consequences were for writing fake prescriptions (this thought literally never occurred to me before I wrote them).  Well, it's a felony, worthy of years in jail and massive fines. FOR ONE PRESCRIPTION. I wrote approximately 30-40.  The sleep deprivation, hunger and intense paranoia hit me all at once and it was in this moment I realized how dependent I was on this drug.  Getting Adderall felt almost like a survival technique. I didn't even stop to think, ""hmm? maybe illegally obtaining a controlled substance by forged documentation isn't such a smart idea after all!""  I was so desperate I didn't even think  my actions through, and was willing to risk my freedom for a quick fix.

 
This is already getting pretty lengthy so I'll cut to the chase. I was taking 100-200mgs a day, with the exception of my sleeping, gorge my face days. I would have done ANYTHING to talk to someone who actually understood what I was going through. I obsessively searched online for forums, adderall addiction sites, chat rooms, anything that showed even the slightest bit of hope for understanding what I felt. Doctor's know pretty much nothing about Adderall addiction and will probably advise you to commit yourself to an inpatient treatment center (which you probably don't need, but I'm not completely knocking it. my doctor suggested this for me dozens of times). Your friends CERTAINLY don't know anything and I'm sure if you've opened up to at least one of them, you've received the same ignorant response I did: ""Why don't you just like, stop taking them?""


This suggestion infuriated me, and made me feel more distant and alone than I had before I brought it up. As much as it comes from a place of ignorance and disregard for your physical and mental dependence on drugs, it's completely right. You need to get the fuck off of it. I avoided it for the same reasons you did: weight gain, uncontrollable binging, extreme fatigue, not being able to think clearly, depression, extreme irritability, poor grade performance, etc. There were even a few times I thought I would never get off this drug, that I would stay on it forever.


My addiction to Adderall was a tumultuous, passionate love affair, but I know I wasn't the same person I was before. And you know you're not either. I completely lost my sense of self beyond that of my addiction. I felt bland and artificial. I don't think you're as bad as I was, but you are physically and mentally dependent on this drug. You admitted it and went somewhere for help, and that's the first step!


Now I'm going to be honest with you. Recovery's gonna suck. Really suck. You will gain weight. You will probably need AT LEAST 2-3 weeks of being able to do nothing but sleep, eat, and shit. You will eat a lot and may feel out of control. People around you won't understand how exhausted and sad you are. That's why you have no idea how proud of yourself you will be when you get over this, because you did it completely on your own. Stimulants are one of the hardest drugs to quit (second to heroin I'm pretty sure) because they are almost entirely a mental addiction. You will feel tired and hungry, but that's about the extent of the physical effects.


You will gain control over your thoughts, relationships, and mood and discover your sense of self again. You won't feel empty and robotic anymore, and will be able to accomplish things through your own motivation. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat it and say it's not a daily struggle, though. It's been almost 8 months and I still don't feel fully recovered. I gained 30lbs in 3 months (no i did not eat my family), but I attribute most of that to my history of eating disorders, not the Adderall addiction. You will probably gain some weight, but no where near the amount I did in the time I did. Your body will go back to your natural, healthy weight once you get regular sleeping and eating patterns under control. I still experience brain fuzz, and I can still sleep most of the day away. Being in college surrounded by people using, abusing, and selling Adderall makes temptation a constant struggle as well.  Admittedly, sometimes my temptation won.  Knowing what you've been through though, you will NEVER go back to living that way again. I have an incredibly addictive personality and knew I was spinning out of control into addiction, but most people become addicted by accident, or without knowing their dependency until they stop.  Doing it every once in awhile (but RARELY) in a moderate amount is harmless, and I was able to remain in complete control for the last part of my college career. Haven't done it since. You'll be surprised by your newfound ability to take it once or twice a year without any dependence on it or desire to fall back again.


I'm sorry this is so long and babble-y, but I want to offer to you what I was needing so much during that dark period of my life. Please message me anytime, I'm on Reddit around 100x a day.

My ex (David) and I were together when we were both 22 for a year. I fell in love with him rather quickly, while he always said the ""L"" word freaked him out and I knew if I told him he would leave me. For about 9 months he was the best boyfriend I had ever had. But then he started to get comfortable when we hung out. Playing video games while I was over and didn't really care for my feelings. He also became depressed because it was winter time. I tried to be there for him, but he pushed me away. It hurt so much. 

David eventually dumped me. I cried so much. I didn't eat, hang out with anyone and only went  to work and went home and slept for 6 months. David and I decided NC was the best way to go. At 4 months, I emailed him telling him I hadn't gotten over him (stupid I know) and that I still thought about him every day. He sent one back saying I was pathetic and he had already moved on with his life and I was stupid to hang around him when clearly he didn't show interest in me. It hurt so much to read that. 

His best friend, Steve, was there for me during this time. Steve and I didn't hang out but texted a lot. Steve would try to counsel me because he was going to college to be a psychologist. Eventually Steve and I developed feelings for each other. But we didn't hang out. We both dated people but none of them really interested us. I was scared to date Steve because of David. I didn't want to wreck their friendship. But eventually Steve and I hung out and had an awesome time together. 

A year had pasted since David and I broke up and I felt like I was over him. Steve and I had hung out more times. We went to amusement parks together, the mall, out to eat, everything. The biggest one was when we saved up money to go to France together. Best time ever. It is also the time we had our first kiss and the first time we had sex. We were both so confused after, but then I said fuck it, if we are happy together, let's not give a shit about what David thinks. So we did exactly that. Without really telling David.

For the longest time it was hard to keep our relationship a secret. Steve asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. After about 8 months of sleeping together, I found out I was pregnant. The condom had broke a few times without us knowing and even though I was on birth control, I still got pregnant. Meant to be, right? Well...eventually Steve had to tell David. And he did. David blew up. I have no idea why if he didn't care about me, but he mostly was pissed his best friend would keep this a secret. 

During the pregnancy, Steve was the best boyfriend to me ever. He worked over time, while I worked part time, because I'm one of those women who are miserable when pregnant. Steve would rub my back when it hurt and always bring me food and held my hair back in the morning when I threw up. Just an amazing guy to have around when pregnant. He told me he was in love with me...one day, right after I threw up. I brushed my teeth and told him I loved him too. 

After our baby girl was born, we decided to get married. I never thought I would get married in my life and it seemed like a crazy thing to do but it was also for our baby girl. Steve and I had no problems so I thought it would be a good idea...and it still was a good idea. 

4 years later, Steve and I have our own home together, both work full time, have a baby sitter, and an amazing little 4 year old. She's the light of my life and I always dreaded pregnancy and raising a child, but with Steve he made it so easy for me. 

David still dates on and off, never holding a relationship. I'm the longest relationship he has had, and he even told one of our friends he felt bad for the way he had treated me and wishes he would of paid more attention to me. I find this funny because of how much he rejected me at the time and how much he broke my heart. It's almost like I got my revenge by having what he wants the most. A real relationship.

I normally am upbeat and friendly with almost everyone. but deep down inside i secretly loathe interacting with people beyond idle chit chat. its so time consuming and demanding that it just agitates me. and thats the word for it. agitates. interacting with most people except for about six people i actually care to talk to. texting in general agitates me at how impersonal and time consuming it is. 



To continue, many may ask why i do this. Well its because for the better part of my teen years i was treated as subhuman and didnt deserve to be loved. was left by both my parents at some point, went through multiple parental divorces, moved a bunch, dealt with depression and had to carry myself mostly. on top of that i have been used for being nice and ive been taken advantage of. I have been shat on by any girl ive liked and strung along for weeks or even months at a time. MY confidence got crushed everytime.



So in summary, i hate people. they suck and take away my energy and they have made me bitter about the next generation and what is being taught to it by the sycophantic asswipes of yesterday.






Edit: thank you for all of the responses guys. sadly my most successful post yet. i feel as though i should clarify. the primary reason people give me such a bad taste is one word: complaining. everyone does, few actually do something about it. it is this that makes me spew anger from every orifice. if you want to complain go ahead, ill even listen and try to help. but you keep coming back to me and bitching and not changing a damn thing, then i lose patience quick. this why my last relationship didnt work is because she only complained. 


also to clarify: i dont hate anyone outright. if you have just met me i am normally friendly and would give you the shirt off my back. im even hard to piss off. but people are either irrational (a big pet peeve of mine), intolerant, or entitled. also also: hate is a bit of a strong word. more of what i mean upon reflection is that i find interacting with the exception of most family and my small group of two or so close friends, i find any engagement with a person just grating on my energy. the odd part is im extroverted.

1354273589.0,81,self.confession,141pyu,"I worked with an older woman who talked shit about me behind my back.  I got my revenge, then she got hers.",114,33,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/141pyu/i_worked_with_an_older_woman_who_talked_shit/,"I worked at a factory for two years.  My department was a small call center with about 20 employees.  Everyone knew each other really well, and there was plenty of drama.  One person in particular complained all the time and talked shit about everyone.  I was nice to her though and let her cry on my shoulder now and then.  I considered us friends, but was unaware that she was ripping me behind my back, too.

She was 42 years old, divorced and had kids out on their own.  I was 23 years old, single, naive and still a bit socially awkward at that age.

After working there a year and a half, I had a conversation with a closer friend of mine at lunch one day.  She was sorta laughing as she asked me if I asked _____ out on a date.  I was caught off guard and didn't know if she was being serious or not.  After telling her it never happened, I started asking about what other kinds of things had been said about me over the last 18 months.

Based on what I was being told, I got the impression that I had been sold-out, and that the lady talking shit about me cared more about impressing other people in the department than being a loyal friend.  Unbeknownst to her, I was probably the only person who ever liked her.

I basically distanced myself from her for the last six months, but there were several times when she came to me to cry on my shoulder.  I was just as nice to her as I'd always been, offered some encouragement, etc... but the only times we ever spoke was when she came to me, or if we just happened to be working on something in the same team.  I never walked over to her desk again just to chat, the way I used to.

A couple months after leaving the company, she texted me out of the blue and asked how I was doing.  She had my number because we had forwarded funny pictures to each other in the past.

I was hesitant to reply because I basically had ripped her apart after I was let go, and I wasn't sure if she knew about that or not.  I had spoken to about a dozen people and told them she was a complete piece of shit, a liar, manipulator, nutjob, etc...

Well, I kept my reply short and told her a little about my new job.  At first I tried to sorta brush her off, but she got to talking about drama going on at work.  As I always did in the past, I offered some advice and some words of encourage, and tried to put her mind at ease.

She thanked me and told me I was a great guy.  Then she asked if I wanted to come by for a few beers.

I told her I was busy and that maybe another time would work, though I had no intention of ever going over to her house.  I totally believed what others had said about her -- she was evil.  I didn't want anything to do with her.

She texted me a couple more times over the next 20 minutes, telling me that I should check out her place and have a few beers.

That was the very first time the idea ever occurred to me that I could possibly get her in the sack.  I acted reluctant in my reply but said I would be over in a half hour.

Again, as always I was nice.  She showed me around, then I sat at her dining room table for an hour as she talked shit about everyone.  I was feeling more comfortable as time went on, and I cracked a few jokes here and there and we got to laughing.  I still thought this lady was a piece of shit and to this day I still do.

I was planning on just coming out and saying, ""Hey, let's fuck"" and as I got to that point... I kid you not... I was not feeling the least bit nervous about it, despite the fact I was still an awkward kid at that age.  But what I had going for me was I knew everyone thought she was a liar anyways.  I was convinced that she could say anything and nobody would believe it.

Well, I don't want to turn this into a graphic sex story, but I will say this much...

As we ran out of things to talk about, I tried to muster up any sort of charm that I could.  I don't know what I looked or sounded like to her, but I tried to appear very buzzed.  I politely asked if she would like to have sex.  I know that isn't the least bit charming, but I thought given the circumstances that she might say yes.  After all, she's obviously a lonely woman in her 40s and I'm young and in good shape.  I wasn't concerned about what she might tell people because there was just no way in Hell that anyone would believe it, especially considering how I had spent the last two years as the strange/awkward guy in that department.

She was holding a beer and smiling, and started to nod her head.  Then she said, ""Okay... sure!"".

I don't even want to analyze how well things went after that.  Beats me.  All I can say is there was some kissing, some rolling around, some fucking...

I enjoyed myself and I think she did, too... but to be honest I didn't give a shit.  I probably sucked at it, who knows... it wasn't going to matter anyways.  I just wanted to get my rocks off so I pounded away the best I could.

The kicker is that at the end I pulled out and shot a load in her face as she was saying, ""No no no....""  I just quickly apologized and acted really sorry for the rest of the evening, as I was putting my clothes back on.

That little move on my part didn't spoil the evening.  But a few days later my friend called me on her lunch break and said, ""I can't believe you had sex with _____.""

I'm like, ""What are you talking about?""  I thought I was playing it cool.

Then she goes, ""______ had a picture of you on her cell phone.


It turns out she took the picture as I was getting dressed.

And I feel it is appropriate that any personal attacks or unnecessary harassment should be deleted with no exceptions and repeat offenders banned. Obviously there's a difference between genuine, constructive criticism and outright abuse, but even your constructive criticism isn't something you should expect the poster to take on board or even look at. I know this is probably going to fall on deaf ears, most of the people on here are awesome and know how to use this sub correctly.

At the last minute, we end up inviting a few girls (three of them) over to liven things up a little bit. Some background info on these girls; girl 1 is an old childhood friend of mine. I think of her as a sister. Girls 2 and 3 are both engaged. Coincidentally, the fiances of both these girls happen to be out of state at the moment. Now I confess that I have always considered both girls 2 and 3 attractive, but I would never dream of making a move on them, you know? I'm going into this evening with absolutely no expectations of having any sex, just a bunch of friends having drinks and watching movies. Anyway, everyone meets up and we start having fun. About an hour into the night, girl 1 is revealed to be a VERY emotional drunk. She has a full on panic attack. My buddy, being the respectable, upstanding gent that he is, gets her away from the action and pretty much spends the rest of the night comforting her and keeping her from hyperventilating. That leaves just me and girls 2 and 3. We continue on through the night and it isn't long before we're all absolutely shit-faced. One thing leads to another, and before you know it the clothes start coming off. Suddenly the three of us are in a full blown orgy right in the middle of my best friend's living room. 


This has been really fucking with my head all day, and I just want to get it off my chest. I knew the entire time we were screwing around that what we were doing was wrong, but at the time I was just too damn drunk to care. The only thing I've been able to tell myself to make me feel better is that I know for CERTAIN I did not make any advances toward either of these two girls, they were the ones to initiate the horseplay. That said, I realize that I'm guilty of not saying ""No"" either. I know that I can't really justify what happened; I feel like the biggest asshole on the planet at the moment. I've been cheated on before so I know firsthand just how devastating it is.....

It'd be really great just getting some opinions on all this, just having somebody to talk to about it would be really helpful for me.

And i was pretty confused. He locked the door and told me to pull down my pants. I didn't really know what was going on so i just did what he said. After this he started blowing me. Although the feeling was enjoyable, I'm straight and would never have this happen currently. After he was done we went to bed and the other kids fell asleep but my ""friend"" and i were still awake. He decided it would be a good idea to put his dick in my butt. He fucked me until we fell asleep. He didn't cum nor did i wake up with his dick in my butt. But he was definitely fucking me. Now some of you say i didn't really resist but that morning when my dad picked me up. Right as he was downstairs i was brushing my teeth and my ""friend"" walked in and whipped his dick out and told me to suck it. i didn't want to at all but he said if i didn't i couldn't leave and he would tell my dad. So i crouched down and hesitated and told me i didn't have to suck it. I only had to lick it. So i did. Im not sure if this is rape, but i just needed this off my chest and someone to talk to about this. Because i shouldn't keep it in forever.

Not to toot my own horn but im good looking, can get girls, good sense of humor. life is good.

I do however have a hidden side of me that only a few know about. Basically If Im not in a relationship with a girl or having casual sex with a girl, I will turn to men. Older men to be more specific. All my friends/family know me as being straight.

When Im with women Im more aggressive and rough/dom. When im with men Im completely submissive and in fact, I don't even like to be touched. I get satisfaction from knowing im pleasing someone else. I find men on craigslist (after quite a bit of screening, pic trading, and chatting.) And I've gone all the way. But have no desire to get emotionally attached to them, it is purely sexual. Im into kink too.

The men are usually 30's-mid 50's, usually single guys, but always older. I often fantasize about sucking and getting fucked by them. There's something about an older guy that shows power and masculinity that is powerful. I always play safe because I am extremely afraid of catching a disease. But I constantly get off on the thought of sucking them and having them finish in my ass/ being dressed up in panties and used.

I know to most people being Bi really isn't a big deal but I would never admit it to anyone. Im afraid that someday I will be outed by someone that recognizes me or notices me from a friend of a friend, but maybe thats just me being paranoid. Sometimes I feel guilty after I hook up with a friend. I also would love to have a family some day but also do not want to have to face marriage/divorce.

It was located next to the bathrooms. I spent a couple of minutes there and from my peripheral vision I saw a glimpse of man standing behind the bathroom door. I thought nothing of it. Until I looked closer and notice that the man behind the door had his hand in his pants and was staring at me. My mom came to check up on me and I told her about the man in the restroom but as soon as she turned around he closed the door and my mom left. I was starting to get creeped out but continued to play games. Then the door opened up again. He continued doing what he was doing but this time he had took his penis out. This time I decided to leave and went outside. There was a bench outside located in front of the laundromat. Behind the bench were these large windows and you could see the seats inside the laundromat. The man that was in the restroom saw me leave and sat in the seats inside the laundromat. He had a newspaper in his hand and put it on his lap. I was thought he was going to read it but he then proceeded to take out his penis again and start to masturbate. I turned around because I did not want to watch what he was doing. Then I heard a tapping on the window and turned to see him trying to call my attention. I was very scared and decided to move somewhere else. I then saw him get up and I was terrified at this moment. He got in his car and continued to masturbate. He then tried to call me over and I don't know why but I decided to go up to him. He told me to get in his car but I knew better and was starting to walk away when he said it in a more forceful tone. I was just standing there scared not knowing what to do. My mom then came out to look for me and told me not to talk to strangers. When the man saw my mom he left immediately. My mom did not notice what was going on and just told me not to play on the parking lot. I am pretty sure if my mom would not have came out when she did I would most likely not have seen her or the rest of my family ever again. To this day I refuse to go to anymore laundromats.

Bonus, the bloodflow from the workout causes my muscles to swell, increasing my chances with the lades!

I couldnt believe what I was seeing... I stopped dead in my tracks and started rubbing my cock thru my shorts. I was alone in the backyard of the 2 family house we shared, and it was like 10 at night... the next thing I knew I had my dick out and was stroking it in the cool night time air.

S, on the other hand, told me that he was still closeted and no one knew but me.

(xpost from ask reddit),128,51,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ejdsk/took_an_ex_back_after_she_fucked_another_dude_and/,"TL/DR Ex cheated the night before she terminated her pregnancy, and I took her back.

Well, not quite when they found out I was not the cheater, in fact I never considered it. She on the other hand was a repeat offender and I, well a bit of a naive fool for not noping the fuck out on the first time.

I had a girlfriend for about four years, we met shortly after I left school and within three months we were in love, fucking hard, passionate, wild, uninhibited, free. It was wonderful, she was smart, engaging, funny, liked good music and as the summer ground on we found that both of us had huge flaws but we loved one another so we we're able to work through and start to grow together. It was good, it was new, we we're * committed* and adult. So we did the whole shtick, I went into business started working hard, she went through a couple low end jobs with my support and finally she bought a car and was able to start to go back into her professional life. It was tough sure, but we made it work. After about a year though she started getting antsy, restless.

It was summer now, about a year after we had gotten together she was restless, you could feel it, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Our relationship began to suffer, she started hitting the bars at night, driving home 12-15 miles at 3 am, red-eyed, sometimes horny, other times looking for a fight, usually drunk. It was tough, she was up, then down, amazing weekend one weekend, hot late drunk night the next. We fucked a lot, stress relief I supposed, but at one point it took, well you know it happened, wrong time, no protection, bam she's pregnant. I'm scared, a little weirded, my kid is in there... I'm excited, I'm going to be a Dad.

Trouble is she's still pounding the bottle, we talk long and extensively about where we can go together, how we can make things work, numbers, jobs, living situations, and a ton of ""look, I love you I'm here for you"", naturally we talked about the alternative, termination. My position was well, it is not my body it's not my decision, I'll support her decision if a termination is what she wants, but I want to keep the kid. Overall, we decide together, we're giving it a shot. Well after about three weeks we've gone through the preliminaries, she gets an ultra-sound. Sees the little smudge of DNA life inside of her. She's petrified, in days she transforms from cautiously optimistic to paranoid, volatile, back to the bars, back to her friends.

The friends. Her crowd was always different from mine, a little rougher, a bit sharper on the edges, lots of kids that didn't quite fit when younger. It was a pretty mixed bag, a couple were in and out of psychiatric wards, some were daddy's girls, others (well the smart ones) moved off for a few years, some didn't come back. She (the ex) had a pretty on off relationship with a friend, they we're the kind that crossed paths every couple months, the kind that sounded bottom and ran together a bit. When they were out on the town, they were a force of nature, wild . Her people, when she got out there she'd run, she'd boogie, she was a sexual animal, sensual, and easy to notice. Her friends well good, bad, not much of a network though.

Her friend lived with a roommate, a washed up kind of once upon a time emo kid with three children and a pissed off ex wife, the salty kind. I never knew him well, I didn't like him though, he was distant, didn't give the vibe of feeling much of the presence, an underlying touch of hostility, the kind of simian animal urge gave those flags that this dude, watch him, he's eyeing your girlfriend was there almost foretelling the end.

Well, the collision was not inevitable, but all the pieces were there. The ex was terrified of the notion of losing her freedom, her ability to set the world on her own terms, to come and go as she pleased, I think underneath everything she feared commitment, she feared that a kid would be one of those transformative catalysts that would break her from her former self, box her constrain her. She rebelled and howled against an unfair world, against the social pretension of a relationship saved? contrived? by a pregnancy and proposal. She started hanging out with her friend, and she set a date. She'd terminate, at first I was indifferent coldly the reality set in that what life, what potential we had inadvertently created was about to slip away. A sort of fatalistic pall touched the relationship, coldness ran through the spirit, she was peeling away, spinning ever so slowly and there was nothing I could do. Conversations devolved into pop-psychology, voices rose, the storm had arrived. She'd leave declaring never to return but she'd be there in the morning.


Finally one night, ""I'm staying out"". 
One night

.two nights

.three nights

She was at her parents’ house, I knew this, I missed her the house was on the way into my work, her car was there every morning. she kept in touch, texting every day, we spoke, things were distant, difficult, but the love was there in the background whispering to both of us ""just keep at it"" I receive a call, we talk, she's coming home, for a week she is around the house we start opening back up, talking about well can we make this? We're growing, we're moving forward, she's coming back down. The termination date is looming, four days before it and I've been thinking, finally I ask, ""Can we push this back? Let's give this a try give it another 3 weeks, we're doing well."" Nothing. no answer.

The Night before zero hour, she leaves. No call, no show, I'm up all night. Bottle of scotch in my hand. I'm petrified, we're back to square one, the rocks are looming, the storms started up again. The kind of sleepless anxiety, with tired red eyes, waiting to see the light in the driveway, the headlights never came. I watched the sunrise that morning, one of those hot muggy Virginia sunrises. The lurid reds, pinks, orange, yellow, seeped in over the horizon mixed together through the humidity and spilled honey over the yard, slow a steady stream a flow to the home. She never came home that night. I knew why. The phone rang about 9:30, her voice, hoarse from cigarettes, asks me to breakfast.

We meet, she’s disheveled, her hair is crazy, her eyes sunk, full of tears and anger, she smells like sex, cigarettes, semen, and she's straight out. ""I cheated on you last night, he fucked me, and I wanted him to do it"". I fumbled “why? “, ""we're over, I don't want you, I don't want this, I want to be free"". I knew who it was; it was the friend’s roommate the washed out emo fucker. Four hours later I sat in the clinic on a bench, the room was full of sad faces, terrified faces, confused faces, she asked the attendees not to allow anyone in. I wanted to hold her hand, I wanted to hold her and tell her it would be okay, that this would pass, that I love her. But I couldn't, my only solace was the cold tile floors staring back at me. I knew somewhere behind those doors a little bit of us disappeared that morning. We named him/her lizard, the photo's still around somewhere. She didn't come out until after I'd left, the nurses kept tabs. She came home that evening I held her and we cried.

I had a girlfriend from the time I was 16 to 18, things were great. I was her first everything. Out of the blue she breaks up with me. This is in January. We stay out of contact until mid April. She calls out of the blue to come and talk, she comes over and we immediately commence doing everything but talking. She'd been on the pill for 2 years and we'd always gone without a condom so yeah. Anyhow we decide to go on date during the weekend and do so. The next week she calls it off again. In May she calls to tell me she thinks she is pregnant. I take her a pregnancy test and its positive. We decide to try to work things out and I go with her to the dr for an official test. I was 18 but excited, the only thing I ever wanted was a family, but I didn't want to be a part time father. So things were looking up. Well I take a job in a warehouse and leave my restaurant job behind in order to become a more adequate provider. I call her from work on a break and she tells me she doesn't want to be with me. I am upset, I tell her what about the baby, and she says she doesn't want me around right now. I tell her if I'm not going to be around, I'll never be around. She said fine and we hung up. We never spoke again. She has the baby. She told a somewhat mutual friend that the baby wasn't mine and she only slept with me because she already knew she was pregnant and wanted to have me raise the baby and not the real dad because he was illegal and hasn't been able to find him. I consult an attorney, who advised me to leave things be and see what she does. I do. Nothing happens. I  decide I will just move on from the situation because I didn't have the means to sue for paternity and wasn't even sure about it to begin with(keep in mind I was 18). I go on to get married and start a family and have two children. Out of curiosity I look up this ex one day and see that she has some pics of her and her daughter and she is a spitting image of me. There's no doubt in my mind she's mine, yet I feel nothing. 

I don't dare tell my wife because this isn't a 100% certainty, but I'm as close to 100% as I can be. I have to keep this secret, or I am choosing to I should say...to protect my family, myself, I know it's selfish and I feel like an asshole and definitely like a deadbeat but I really don't see any bright side to this. I look at the girl and don't feel anything, and that makes me sad. I love my other children greatly and would never turn them away but I feel like that's what I've done with this girl. I guess I am choosing to live with this secret for now and possibly forever. 

TL;DR: Always thought I had a kid out there, got a very good reason to believe I do, but don't feel anything towards the kid and feel bad about it.

He studied archaeology, spent years digging and then for a few years went through the process of becoming a priest. Though he wasn't successful in that it's still the one thing he's most known for in the family. He's older than me by maybe 20 years but since he's my cousin I never really notice how much older he or his siblings are than me. Every year for Thanksgiving, Christmas, sometimes Mother's Day the entire family would converge at Grandma's house. That's 11 aunts and uncles, their children whose ages range from 9 all the way to 40 and their children. It was always a big thing and at that house I would always see my archaeologist/priest cousin and he'd acknowledge me with a brief handshake and call me by the wrong name. That was pretty much the extent of our relationship and in some small way it irked me very much how we never talked. That being the case I never really...cared about him that much.

I think my parents knew this and didn't want me to live with them for the rest of my life, so they said I had to move out by the end of summer. No big deal, I got a job at a frozen yogurt place and moved into an apartment with three of my friends. Most of the people I knew my age were taking classes at a local community college so I did the same. I told my advisor that I didn't know what I wanted to study so she just had me do some general education requirements, WR 101, Bio 101, Pre-Calc, etc. 

I didn't really find any of these classes interesting. I've never really found any school subjects very interesting. However, the classes were pretty easy and I had some friends in them so it wasn't a big deal. My job was also pretty good as far as minimum wage jobs go. I got free yogurt, my coworkers were pretty chill, and there was a lot of downtime. However, I still thought a lot about how my perfect life would be not having to go to school or work. 

I was always happiest on weekends where I didn't have to work. I would sleep until noon. Wake up and make myself a big breakfast. Then I would smoke a joint or two with my roommates while playing video games. Around 6 or 7 we'd get together with some of our other friends and get food. Then we'd find a house party to go to and get cross-faded. If I was lucky I'd find a slightly-above average girl to take home with me but if not it wasn't a big deal. 

Anyways, that was my life for about a year and a half and I was pretty happy with it but didn't like  having to go to school or work. Then one day my parents called and told me that my Grandma had died. My Grandpa (who died a few years earlier) had been the vice-president or something of a bio-medical company so he had made quite a bit of money. My parents told me that my Grandma had left $50000 to each of her grand-kids including me. After taxes I ended up with a little over $40000. 

That was about 5 months ago. After the term ended at community college I didn't sign up for classes for the next term. I also quit my job although I'm pretty sure I could go back if I wanted too because the owner liked me and he owns a few stores so he would probably have an opening for me. Anyways, for the past few months my life has been perfect. I sleep in every day, hang out with friends and play video games all the time, and go to lots of parties on the weekend. 

I don't have a car and I am pretty good about controlling my spending, so I've only been going through about $600 total a month. This means that my money should last for a good 5 years even with inflation and some unexpected expenses. However, I know that my lifestyle can't last forever. I will run out of money but also my friends will grow up and get real jobs and have families and I don't want to be a loser living in an apartment by himself working at a minimum wage job. 

The problem is that I can't think of anything that I actually want to do with my life. My friends talk about how they want to design cars or program video games and its like yeah, those sound like pretty cool jobs but I'd still rather just stay at home and not do anything. Basically I feel like I'm at a crossroads and I could do a bunch of different things with my life which is pretty cool but at the same time I'd much rather be able to stay home and not have to do anything.

Anyways I found out in August when I went in to see my gyno for my yearly exam. For a split second when I was told I thought ""maybe I'll have a miscarriage"". I don't even know why I thought that. Maybe out of fear but after I thought that I was so happy. 

I would talk to my baby everyday even though I knew he couldn't hear me. I had placenta previa during my pregnancy so I started bleeding at 16 weeks pregnant. At almost 19 weeks I went into preterm labor and delivered my baby boy. He was 8.25"" and weighed 9 ounces. 

I'm completely heartbroken. I lost him on November 5, 2012. I have trouble sleeping and eating. I know it's irrational and silly but I blame myself for thinking that horrible miscarriage thought. 

I feel so guilty that my son died. I hate myself for losing him. I blame myself. My body, my thoughts, it was me who killed him. There are times when I wish it were me that had died instead, which I know is impossible. If I had died that day, my baby would still have died as well. 

I'm a former cutter and I dabbled a bit in drugs when I was a teen. I so desperately want to cut but I'm trying to be strong for my son even though he's not here. The drugs haven't been tempting me, but ( and again this is stupid) I wonder if my drug use 9 years ago fucked up my body in some way that made me lose my baby.

I'm a trans female and a lesbian, so I guess I kinda hit a lot of the ""LGBT"". I'm taking hormones, have come out to a lot of people, live as both genders right now while transitioning (still male for school + work). Really trying to do it right, but in reality I fucking hate myself for doing this.

I'm bitterly homophobic when it comes to myself, but not others. I would never admit this to people I know, because I truly believe that no one should ever be discriminated against. But I hate myself for being queer, I really do. All I can think in my head is what a faggot I am. Wasting time, money, resources to transition... when honestly I feel like I'm just a pussy who wants to make excuses as to why I can't be a real man. Even though I know I can't help how I feel. Probably also cause I'm always unhappy, never really was happy, so again I feel like I'm a pussy.

I never thought I would do this 18 months ago, even though I've always wanted to.. I knew I had too when I started reading stories about how this doesn't go away.. and how you can actually change genders. So it's fucking dumb to delay transitioning when it's inevitable... but my mind, my mind is still telling me I'm being a pussy for abandoning my male biology... I'm just a wimpy faggot. And I hate what a burdensome loser I am to people now. I hate how undesirable I am to people. And I hate how it kills my mom that I'm doing this, though she tries to accept it.

I also hate how even though I don't live full-time yet... I kinda like how I look as a dude now.. sort of. Since I look pretty attractive as a dude now, since my face is really feminine and ""pretty"" for a boy. Now I'm feeling like maybe I could stay this way since I kinda like my hair line returning and my male face being so good looking... lol what a freak I am. A pretty boy with tits now... great. I'm a little bitch.jpg But oh I love the femininity awashing over me... being male and muscly and short hair was eww... again that's the pussy in me talking... that has finally overpowered the man in me.

I don't want to post this to my friends and put more crap on them from me (seriously how can they relate to my stupid bullshit? I can't believe people even befriend me), or post this on a trans subforum (don't want to hear that I should just go full-time already since zomg your so pretty or some crap like that). I kinda have always detested my life... and again I feel like a pansy for saying this over and over again when other people got it worse, like living in some third world hellhole. What a fag I am for wanting to die so many times when nothing is physically wrong with me, it's all just mental bullshit that I can't man up and get over. I hate myself for being so weak and always being unhappy, not even being happy with my own shit... jesus what is wrong with me.

I live in a predominantly black area in New York City. For as long as I could remember, I never fit in, and many of my peers in school would bully and torment me for it.

I hate rap music, as I think for the most part it's very generic and its meanings are shallow (yes, I care about what songs mean--sue me). I don't talk in ebonics (I am an aspiring writer, so grammar is important to me. Even when I text people I don't use netspeak. I might be a little too anal about that, but whatever), I don't dress like a thug and wear baggy clothes--I'm on the polar opposite end of the spectrum. I have straight hair--I get called 'emo' a lot by ignorant people, I wear band tee's and witty shirts and skinny jeans and skater shoes.

I don't like watermelon (I'm actually allergic to it! I have a weird set of allergies), I like fried chicken, but no more than your average person does and I don't indulge in it excessively, I don't enjoy basketball (I play soccer). I could go on more but needless to say I hate when I get stereotyped when I don't fit any of them.

We moved to Pennsylvania a while back (3 years ago) and it was a predominantly white area and literally, not a day passed by where someone didn't have something to say about the color of my skin. It was definitely an eye opening experience, that's for sure.

I've met some cool, intelligent black people. But they're just too far in between. Majority of black people are ghetto, loud, ignorant, and if you're a fellow black person who isn't into 'urban' culture, all of a sudden you're an 'oreo' because you're 'trying to be white'. It's silly--none of us had any bearing on the ethnicity we were born into. So to pigeonhole that person into a specific culture to follow because of that is absurd.

Black girls don't like me, and look at me scrutinizingly. White girls who like black guys like the stereotypical ones where I'm from, so to see one who's a bit 'different', they get weirded out I guess. Why settle for a black guy who listens to metal and skates when they can find a white guy who does that? The only girls into me are asian girls when I go downtown, and sadly, there aren't any where I live.

I just hate being black. I hate my complexion, I hate having to use a flat iron to straighten my hair as often as I do. I feel as if being black is at the bottom of the proverbial social food chain. As a black male, I can't possibly begin to understand what it would feel like for a black female. There are only negatives, and no positives to speak of. If I could be any race and live anywhere, I'd live in Japan and be Japanese. I always tend to lean more into that direction as far as cultural identification goes anyway. But If I had to live in the U.S, I'd be white, no question about it. There isn't much I wouldn't do if I could change my race right now, as pathetic as that might sound.

On one hand I hate flip flops. On the other hand I realize that my hatred is irrational and unfounded. I really don't know where this came from, but whenever I see someone wearing flip flops, especially guys, I instantly take a disliking to them. There's this attitude that most people who wear them seem to have that I just despise. It's like, ""look how casual and easy-going I am man!"" It seems like they used to be considered feminine shoes. I distinctly remember, in the early 2000s, thinking it was weird to see guys wearing flip flops, because they were a girl shoe. I think their rise in popularity mirrors that of the pink polo shirt, it's some sort of inverted display of manliness that now (in the case of flip flops) lost its original meaning.

Related to this, are the people who brag about how casually they dress, as if laziness is a positive virtue. The arguments for wearing them are stupid, usually that people's feet get hot, they're comfortable, or they're quicker to put on. I can't comment on the first, but the latter two are ridiculous. If you wear flip flops constantly, say hello to disgustingly dirty feet, calluses, and foot trouble in your future. As for the other, do people know how to tie shoes? It takes me literally about 5 seconds to put on my shoes. Even if it did take slightly less time to put on flip flops, is it worth the extra few seconds to have to deal with such an impractical shoe?

The worst is being slowed down by people because of their devotion to these atrocities, even in the most inopportune of scenarios. I kid you not, I have seen people hiking up Mt. Rainier in, yes, flip flops (I mean, not all the way to the top obviously, I mean walking up the trails). I remember going to a friend's birthday party in high school. A few of the guys there insisted on wearing these moronic things when we were trying to play hide and seek or something (I don't remember what exactly, I just remember it involved running and they did nothing but cause trouble). I've seen chemistry labs delayed in school because some imbeciles just had to wear them (despite being told not to) and didn't have any pair or real shoes on hand. The most egregious example I can think of happened last week. I had to go down to the courthouse, and I saw a man, dressed in slacks and a collared shirt, but with flip flops. I can't even fathom how he thought that made any sense.

I have pretty severe OCD (gee, could you tell?). Not internet OCD, I was actually diagnosed, and take medication for it. I've tried talking to therapists about this, but really nothing seems to work. I feel like my disdain is not totally illogical, but the magnitude of it is. When I see flip flops I become angry, depressed, or annoyed.

I'm talking like actively pleading with the universe to snuff this cunt. 

In 2003 I met my wife. At the time her mother was living with her. When things started getting serious with my wife her mother started making snide remarks to my wife about what a loser I was (to be fair, I *was* self employed at the time and not making bags of money, but I wasn't hurting for it either. I wanna say I grossed something like $30k that year). Things like ""he only wants you for your money"", which at the time my wife was making like $45k/yr so I'm not real sure how she figured that one. 

Basically Mary (my wife's mom) was mad that she wasn't going to be able to just sponge off of my wife anymore. 

In December of that year I asked my wife to marry me, and she said yes. For some unknown reason my wife decided to quit smoking as her Christmas present to herself that year, and as a side effect there was to be no more smoking in her apartment (I smoke, as does Mary, but I've never smoked inside as it makes your house smell like a fucking ash tray). Mary gets it in her head that *I* am the reason that she can't smoke inside anymore (this is the only person I've ever known who would smoke while actually taking a shower, I shit you not). She starts a big fight with my wife and decides to move out, also telling my wife that she won't be coming to our wedding. Hey whatever. 

So she moves in with her meth addict son (nice enough guy, but he's a druggie loser).

Time goes on, and the bitch actually does show up to her daughter's wedding and hey whatever.

So about three years later after Mary and her son moving around again and again (landlords don't like druggies), they end up living in hotels. 

I'm making about $70k/yr, my wife is making about $80k/yr, and we're doing just fine. 

One night Mary calls my wife and is crying and hysterical because her son hit her (little did I know at the time she probably *really* fucking deserved it). So my wife wants to know if Mary can stay with us for 2-3 weeks until she gets an apartment. I figured I'd take the high road and I agree. 

That was five years ago, and that cunt is still here. There's always an excuse, she doesn't make enough, she's in poor health, blah blah blah. 

This woman is the most ungrateful cunt I've ever met, and quite possibly the dumbest person on the face of the planet. 

She has diabetes and major heart problems (probably because the only foods she eats are junk and fried shit, smokes two packs a day for like 50 years, drinks 3-4 *pots* of coffee daily, and does fuck all but smoke and watch TV all day). It's not unusual to hear her say things like ""oh my blood sugar gets in the 400's all the time.""

If you don't know any diabetics you might not realize just how bad that is. Anything over 100 is not good. The 300 range is ketoacidosis territory. Frequent 400's is like 'lower extremity amputation is likely' territory. 

She recently had three stints put in because ***all*** of the major arteries in her body are 70% blockage or more. She had a massive heart attack on the table while having the stints put in.

I just want her to die already. I know it makes me a bad person, but I loathe her. 

She is destroying her body, virtually guaranteeing that she will die a prolonged and expensive death, and I just want her to swallow a bottle of morphine (which she takes for her extreme back pain). Just don't do it in my house.

I've tried to talk to my wife about Mary leaving, and it's always ""as soon as INSERT MEDICAL CRISIS HERE is over, I'll tell her she needs to go."" But she won't. Because it'll be some other reason Mary can't be alone. 

My wife's dad died when she was young, and it's gotta suck to know your remaining parent is killing themselves, but it's driving me fucking nuts. 

There is SO MUCH bullshit that goes on with her, I don't even want to inflict the *reading* of it on someone else. 

So basically it comes down to I get divorced, or I have to put up with this cunt until she dies. I could probably convince my wife that Mary has to go, but then she'll die, and it'll turn into ""you took away the last (days, weeks, months, whatever) that I had with my mommy"", and my wife will grow to resent me for it, and I don't want that. 

So basically I am left pleading with the universe to just kill this bitch already so I can get on with my life.

* I had cancer in 7th grade

* My sister died

* That I had 5 sisters (I had one)

* That I was accepted to a special school for geniuses. 

* My dad was rich

* In high school, I claimed to have sex *all the time* and that I had an abortion (still a virgin then).

Teens and my early 20s

* I went to a fancy art school (I didn't even get accepted)

* That I made 300X what I actually made

* that I married a guy and got annulled (this was so odd, we had sex once - bad sex)

* My fake ID said I was 32 and Russian - so I played it up. There are a lot of men that think they hooked up with an immigrated CPA when they were actually the play-things of a confused 17-18-year-old. 

* I would take my friends' funny/awesome stories and say they happened to me. 

* Got married to a guy cause I thought it would be funny, lied to my parents for a year about it. 

And then a break for a bit. I met a decent guy and started a family. I was still terribly depressed and had the lowest esteem but didn't lie about big things. Until 2 years ago...

* I started cheating on my husband. With anyone. I posted ads on craigslist and fucked 20+ guys, all of whom only knew slight truths about me (I told myself the lies were to protect my identity, but really I wanted myself to seem better). 

* I started using fake pictures with men I would meet on-line. I have kept some of the 'relationships' going for 2 years now. I love how they tell me I'm pretty and I can't 'fess up or quit. 

* I got divorced and lied to my father about looking for job so he'd support me. I did have trouble finding one, but I could have looked harder. 

* Once I told my father that I had paid him rent when I hadn't and let him think he'd forgotten. I feel awful about this, he questions his memory now. 

* I tell everyone my business is doing really well, when it's not. 

* I still hook up on cl, I lie to them about everything. 

* I don't take care of myself, at ALL, but lie to my friends about how I can't understand why I'm so unhealthy. 

* There are two men that think we're in a relationship but I have very little interest in them. I really like these other two men but I've lied myself out of it ever being real. I lose interest in a man if I let him know the real me, he must be a loser if he likes me as I am. 

* I'm the mistress of an older married man, because he takes me places. 

* Little lies have caught up with me, everyone around me thinks I'm so much better than I am.


*Well, I have had enough. I'm taking charge of my life and knocking this shit off. I'm selling my laptop soon, TV too. I'm going to eat right, exercise, focus on my business. I will succeed. I'm going to start to do some of the things I've lied about for years (like play the guitar and volunteer). I'm not going to measure my worth in men, in fact no more men period (simple emails to each, good-bye). I'm going to treat my father better. My friends will ask questions about where I am, and I'll explain that I'm a sack-of-shit liar trying to focus on me until I am something that I'd proudly tell the truth about.

My greatest fear is overlap between my separate personas I have created and avoid it at all costs.

I can relate to a quote from American Psycho (that bodes well...):

* “…there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.

The date was going to bring a friend of hers, and, upon explaining this, a female friend of mine offered to casually ""crash"" the date to up my credibility. 

I met up with my friend, and my date stood me up. We decided to go drinking with two of her gay friends. They bought me 3-4 beers and a shot of tequila. I was horribly upset about being stood up. I keep a front about wanting to ""fuck"" girls and be a player, but, deep down, I just want an emotional connection with sex.

The conversation turned extremely sexual while we were drinking. Sharing dirty stories etc. I joked to my female friend that tequila made me horny and that we should go to the bathroom and hook up. We have strong banter and she smiled and called me a dickhead. We hit up a club. While we were standing in line ordering a drink, my friend leaned into me and said that she was going to ""give me the worst blue balls of all time"" . I leaned into her from behind and she leaned into my crotch.

We hit the dance floor and start dancing close. I feel her body. She keeps on dancing into me. I grab her ass. She grins and dances into me. She keeps leaning into me as if to tease me for a kiss. I start dancing towards her and ushering us towards the toilets, half-jokingly. She said, ""no way!"" hit me softly, and i backed off. She comes back and keeps dancing on me, and I get a little more aggressive with the groping. I'm horny, and at this stage i'm hard. The dance floor is packed. 

I lean in and say ""you need a fuck tonight"" and she says, ""the feeling is mutual""

We keep in dancing. I'm not in love with her and I've never considered hooking up with her. I'm hard. Every time I back off she dances back, as if she's teasing (I really wasn't sure about hooking up with her, just so horny and stimulated by the music). I unbutton my pants and expose my underwear, with erection. She raises her hands in surprise and steps back. I don't approach her. She comes back and starts dancing with me, more friends-like. 

We dance for a little longer and it's clear that she's reached her comfort limit. She says I should go home. I do. It never seems like she's angry or hurt, just that she's uncomfortable. I stop immediately and leave. 

The next day, I felt gross thinking about it. I couldn't believe what happened, and what could have happened. I send her a message saying that I couldn't believe that I pulled out my penis on a dance floor. I was hoping to recapture our good banter and make sure that everything was cool. She sent back a couple of vague, but normal messages. 

Day after she explodes at me over text. Saying that I molested her, that her sister had warned her about rapists the day before, and that I was a predator. She made it clear that she's relieved that it wasn't some other poor girl. She says that I tried to have sex with her on the dance floor, then said that I didn't understand the difference between friends flirting and dancing and whatever i was ""trying to do""

I've apologised profusely, made no excuses and tried to explain my thought process explicitly—i let her know that i felt terrible for making her feel uncomfortable, and that I thought we were on the same page. I apologised for my horrible misconstruing of the situation, and told her that I hoped we could work through it.

Did I sexually assault a girl? Is what went through my mind as ""oh this could be fun"" a horrible, unforgivable crime? Is my thinking that fucked up? I really felt like I read the situation fine, and i acknowledge it was risky behaviour. 

I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of this, and couldn't imagine forgiving myself.

I bet you're thinking I went to jail. Nope. I went to college. 

It wasn't the right fit for me from the start. I ended up settling for a school I didn't really want. It didn't matter, the school was cheap and I was planning to go ahead to grad school for physical therapy anyway.

Unfortunately once I got there, it was like the book of job. My jewish roommate decided within 5 minutes of meeting me that I am an ""aryan nazi"" and wanted nothing to do with me. She told everyone that I was related to Hitler and they believed her. Never mind the fact that I'm polish, since I'm blonde and a gentile, I've got to have some nazi in me.

I couldn't believe the cliqueyness and segregation of this campus. It made prison look like a hippie commune. The aryan nation would look downright tolerant and welcoming. People only hung out with those like themselves. I took a sports psychology class and I was the only non-varsity athlete. At the end of it some charmer from the lacrosse team (of course) come out of the blue tell me that he would hook up with me but I wasn't an athlete so ""it would be weird"". You know the undercurrent of cliquey-ness is strong if it actively limits the sex live of lacrosse players. On a more serious note, I became friendly with this one girl from a sculpture class I was taking. We really hit it off and had tons of things in common. One day we decided to get lunch from the cafeteria and she sees some of her regular clique. They come over, refuse to acknowledge me and gave me dirty looks and ask her ""what are you doing hanging out with this white bitch?"". I leave in utter shock and she sends me a text saying that she was sorry but that she ""shouldn't be seen in public with me because it would be awkward. sorry"". She's black. I'm white. I basically avoided her after that.

I tried joining clubs but that was futile. Too many type A students taking themselves too seriously. I considered joining a sorority but at my school, you have to be a ""princess of long island"" to even think about joining. I tried to focus on my studies. PT is a competitive program and when everyone was out partying and having fun, I was staying in and studying. I did OK. But then I saw the sheer amount of cheating that was going on and I realized the odds were stacked against me. The place had cheating down to an art form. There were whole cheating cartels organized. Since I didn't know anyone, it meant I needed to work 100 times as hard as some frat boy with an advanced copy of the test.

Eventually I realized I was in some kind of existential prison camp and treated it as such. I kept my head down, stayed out of everyone's way. I minded my own business and didn't try to make waves. In my minimal downtime I read books. I worked out religiously. I focused on my work. But Friday nights when I heard everyone going out and having fun I would force myself to choke down those bitter feelings and stay focused on my physics homework. I just couldn't understand how a young, athletic, attractive young woman would end up so isolated and alone around people her age.

That was until I showed up to the emergency roomed with severe abdominal pain and GI bleeding. The doctors diagnosed me with Crohn's disease. If you don't know what that is, I can assure you it is horrible and disgusting. I had to miss a ton of school. The day I got my medical withdrawal form was the happiest day of my life. I moved home and I commute to school. I study nursing now. Its stressful but fulfilling. I've kept my Crohns under control more or less but the medicine I take made me fat and grouchy. But at least I don't feel like I'm in prison. I told everyone I was happy at school and had tons of friends because I was afraid so ashamed of the truth.

But I get depressed thinking about those years I won't get back. Those were supposed to be the best years of my life and I spent them miserable and it was 100% my fault. No one should do that to themselves and I should have left sooner. I pretend those years didn't happen. I cut them out of my life. I tell people I spent some time in Poland instead of telling them the truth. I've started shaving a little off my age in an attempt to recapture some lost youth. I've been thinking of changing my name to distance myself from that place. I can't explain what was so horrible about it. It felt like the problems I had were the result of some kind of serve personal failure. I gained nothing from that experience but I won't let it drag me down. I don't know if I am ready to speak honestly about the experience.

TLDR

College was so bad I was happy that I got to take a medical leave for a terrible diease. I'm still pissed that I didn't leave earlier. Man, that place messed me up. Also I might be mildly anti-semetic after being called Eva Braun all the time.

When I was a kid, I lived in a small apartment next to the train tracks along with my three brothers and one sister. Our mother was unmarried, and our dad was no longer in the picture. She worked as many jobs as she could and came home late every night, only to leave in the morning before we got up. The only day she didn't work, Sunday, we would all go to the grocery store. She would make it a game for us to pick the least expensive things we could find, which was a fun game when I was young and didn't realize why it was so necessary. We would show her all we found, she'd choose what she wanted out of it, and then we would buy it with food stamps. 

Food stamps didn't mean anything to me until I turned twelve and went on to jr. high. I was bullied because my shoes had holes and I would wear the same stupid thrift store clothes all the time and my sister would cut my hair herself so my bangs were always jagged and uneven. 

I was ashamed of my family and our poverty. I wouldn't let anybody's parents drive me all the way up to my apartment; I would tell them to drop me off on the corner and I would walk the rest of the way so they wouldn't see how we lived. Yet it seemed I was the only one who couldn't appreciate what we had. My family loved each other in a way that I don't think every child gets to experience. I didn't see that. All i saw was the stained walls and too-small clothes and the horrible smell. And the food stamps.

My father came back into the picture when I was fifteen. My mother lost custodial rights of me (my brothers and sister were all eighteen and over at this point) and I moved to L.A. to live with my dad. 
On the last day with my mother as I was packing up my stuff, surrounded by cps agents, she was sobbing, begging me to stay, trying to convince them that I needed her. After being refused a thousand times, she ran into her bedroom and came back with an envelope for me. She handed it to one of the agents, saying it was for me, and I turned around, completely expressionless, and said ""Where I'm going, I won't need food stamps."" 
The heartbroken look on her face after I said that will always be in my head. It is the manifestation of all my guilt and all I made her suffer. 

After I moved in with my dad i adapted to a cushy and extravagant lifestyle. He was never home but he let me buy whatever I wanted. I got into a prestigious college on the east coast and that's where I am now, living in a lovely apartment that I didn't earn, living a life I don't deserve.

Today I was at the grocery store with two of my friends picking up some things for a party I'm throwing tomorrow night. About two people in front of us in the checkout was a young mother who was taking forever to pay. She had a young daughter who looked about four or five at her side as she pulled out a mountain of crumpled coupons and food stamps. The man in front of us, who was buying five bottles of wine, leaned forward and said ""Would you hurry the hell up?"" My friend backed him up, saying some of us had things to do, places to go, etc. I watched this poor young mother get badgered by wealthy people who had no idea what she had to go through every day, and I didn't do anything.

I knew exactly what she had to go through every day. Yet I didn't say anything. i just stared down at my beautiful shoes, played with my gold bracelet, hiding under a blanket of my undeserved wealth. 
When she finally finished she apologized profusely, her eyes staring at the ground, her voice soft and humble. She took her daughter by the hand and walked towards the door. The little girl looked back at me and our eyes met for a second, and all of a sudden the life I had tried so diligently to forget was happening before my eyes. Yet I did nothing.

My mom passed away last year, at least that's what I heard. She tried to contact me after I moved to L.A. but I refused. I shunned her, left her behind, while I lived in luxury. 
I'm only in contact with one of my brothers, and that's only once every couple of months. 
I live in denial of a life my mother slaved away to give me. 

What have I done.

When it's time to burn that bridge, I'm going to ask her what she wanted to name her first daughter or her first son. How many did she want? How many boys? How many girls? Did she pick out more than one name?

I've always had a gift for accidentally stumbling on to people's weak spots, but I have never wanted to exploit what I find for any kind of satisfaction. 

But I'm doing that now with my parents, especially my dad, and this cunt sister of mine is next on the list. 

Last year, I grabbed a gun and threatened to commit suicide. I was angry, and really didn't know whether I should or not, but she said ""Go ahead."" In that moment, her fucked up comment made me hate her more. And the fact she wanted me to may have been all that stopped me from doing so.

Now, I plan to destroy her emotionally. I'll wait until it's absolutely certain she cannot have children, and start asking her about the family she dreamed about having growing up. I will hit on her learning disability (dyslexia) and her clear social awkwardness and obtuseness in real situations.

I want to gut her emotionally and psychologically until she breaks down and wants to die.

She has repeatedly told me that I am free to have sex with anyone male or female without reprisal from her.

There's the possibility that her learning difficulties weren't caused by this, but it still doesn't stop me from wishing I could go back and do things differently. This is something that I can't find words to apologise for, and I feel like I'm pushing her away without realizing it.

This Christmas she felt like a stranger to me, even though it was one of the first years we could actually hold a conversation with her and understand 90% of what she was trying to say.

When placed in a dangerous situation before, I grabbed my brother and ran, leaving her behind. I don't know why I did this without even thinking, and she doesn't remember it, but my brother does and admits he'd have done the same.

I don't really know how to apologize for this or make it better, since it's not something she really grasps. As far as she's concerned, she's everything she was ever meant to be, but I can't help but think maybe she could have been more.

I have been in a ""relationship"" with the same man for 16 years (minus a brief break). It began when I was 9 and he was 20. We are not related by blood, though we are related by marriage. Clearly it began as a molestation type of situation that simply never ended. When I was 15 years old we ""broke up"" when I convinced him that I wanted to explore possibilities with people my own age. Truthfully I just wanted out of the situation and that was the excuse I gave him, and to my surprise he was very understanding (although understandable worried that I intended to tell someone what had been going on).

I began dating a boy who I liked at school, and it lasted for a few months before I began to miss the other man. I never had sex with that boyfriend, for what that is worth. Eventually I broke up with that boy and went back to my man. He welcomed me back and we have been together ever since. 

A few years into our relationship I had asked him if he had ever been with another little girl before. He claimed then (and still to this day) that he had not, and I took him at his word. However, as I got older and learned a bit more about pedophilia, I became a bit more concerned. Growing up I just accepted our situation for what it was - that we were in a secret relationship and in mutual love. 

Obviously I became more aware that I had been victimized, but truthfully I didn't really care because I was happy with him and I guess I sort of just tucked any negative emotions I had deep inside and let them go. But when I learned that pedophiles are attracted to *children* in general, I became concerned with a lot of things. That he might not be attracted to me anymore since I have grown up, that he is still attracted to other children, that he might be doing things with other children even now, etc...

About three weeks ago he approached me with an absolutely awful confession. That he was very much attracted to our mutual 6 year old cousin (related to me by blood, but not him) and that he wanted my permission to pursue her. Obviously I flipped out on him, and a lot of things I hadn't said out loud before came pouring out. I tried to point out all the things that were wrong with that he was suggesting, emphasizing that she was a child and it would be damaging and *rape* and not to mention illegal ... all the while not really realizing, in the moment, that I was describing our relationship as well.

He did not take it well. He promised not to do anything with our cousin, but became very depressed and passive-aggressive. Accusing me of lying to him for years by making him think I wanted to be with him, when really I felt like a ""victim"" and abused by him, and that the only reason I reacted the way that I did to his suggestion was because I wanted out of the relationship. 

I'm not sure how I feel or where I stand right now. I do not want any other children to be harmed by him, but ... I do not want to tell anyone what had happened between us, I do not honestly want him to go to jail or anything like that, even though I know that is the right thing to want. 

I loved him very much for a very long time, but I've slowly fallen out of love with him as I've matured and come to better understand what is wrong with him and what is wrong with how our relationship began. I suppose my leaving him is inevitable at this point. I'm just not sure what to do about the cousin, or to prevent him from going out and replacing me with another little girl ... I almost feel like I should stay with him just so that he doesn't feel that need to replace me. 

I'm sorry if this is hard to follow. I've never shared any of this with anyone before, and hadn't intended on ever sharing it until these things started coming up.

Some things I imagine people might be wondering off the bat: No, nobody knows and I have never told anyone. I do live with him, and the family knows that I live with him, but they do not know the nature of our relationship. They didn't consider it abnormal that I would want to live with him, since we have always been ""close"" from their perspective, and we have always been regarded as family even though we're not related, etc.
