**Origin of the main characters:**

After his work on the Mewtwo project, Professor Oak made multiple attempts at bioengineering a human clone. The first successful attempt used a 650 nanometer laser, which produced a subject that, while biologically human, lacked human emotion. Professor Oak made a second attempt using a 475 nanometer laser. This produced a more refined, more ""human"" subject who could easily be mistaken for a perfectly ordinary and rambunctious young boy. The first subject was implanted in a surrogate mother living in the town of Pallet, while the second subject matured entirely in Oak's laboratory. The subjects were named ""Red"" and ""Blue"" after the colors of the lasers used in their creation. Postpartum, the surrogate requested to raise subject Red. Professor Oak obliged, and chose to raise subject ""Blue"" as his own grandson.

**How Pokeballs work:**

A Pokeball leaks radiation proportional to the mass of the Pokemon contained within, and the amount of radiation that the human trainer can safely withstand is proportional to their own body mass. This is why many young trainers like Youngsters and Lasses have lightweight Pokemon like Rattata and Jigglypuff, while heavy Pokemon like Geodude and Onix are always carried by a large and muscular Hikers. Of course, the radiation of those balls adds up, so most people are only capable of carrying three or four Pokeballs at a time, if that many. Gym leaders, being in a static location, don't have to carry their Pokemon on their person, and not being in constant close proximity to their Pokeballs, they can usually get away with using up to five. Red and Blue, being genetically engineered superhumans, have the strength to carry up to six Pokeballs at a time.

**""Leveling up""**

When Pokemon participate in battle, an adrenaline-like response kicks in, allowing the use of combat abilities like summoning lightning or breathing fire.  As this happens, Pokemon exude large amounts of radiation.  Their adrenal response also leaves them susceptible to radiation exuded by opposing Pokemon during combat.  This radiation causes Pokemon to mutate, and the extent of these mutations is proportional to the strength of the opponent.  Face a terrifyingly-strong opponent, and high radiation levels and increased susceptibility will lead to rampant mutations.  Weaker foes, conversely, will have little impact on a Pokemon's physique.

These mutations cumulatively add to a Pokemon's strength, and sometimes manifest themselves in the form of increased abilities or appendages.  For example, Bulbasaur might sprout some vines, allowing it to use the move Vine Whip.  Other times, the mutation is more drastic, causing a Pokemon to mutate into an entirely new form.  (Also known as evolution)

Although ""leveling up"" is the usual way for Pokemon to evolve or learn new skills, there are also artificial stimulants that can be used to enhance a Pokemon's combat abilities. You can call them ""performance enhancing drugs"" if you like, but ""Technical Machine"" also works. Evolution stones are just high concentrations of chemicals that cause certain Pokemon to mutate.

**What is the Pokemon League?**

The Kanto region is controlled by four elite emperors, otherwise known as the Elite Four. Kanto is governed under what is essentially a feudal system, with local rulers residing in ""Gyms,"" surrounded by loyal followers/apprentices. The Elite Four is aware of the possibility of a trainer raising Pokemon even more powerful than their own. To prevent such an individual from attempting to stage a violent revolution, the Elite Four has extended a generous offer: anyone who is able to beat them is allowed to join their ranks. Many trainers dream of becoming rulers of the world, but few possess the skill needed to make it even past the first few gyms.

**The Epilogue:**

After conquering the Elite Four, Red became its leader. However, lacking understanding of things like human emotion, he was horribly unfit for the role of leader. Red became known as a despot, inspiring the hatred of all of Kanto. Under his leadership, the skills of the Elite Four atrophied. Red was blind to the rumblings of rebellion throughout Kanto, but was not blind to the fact that his skills as a trainer were growing dull. To rectify this, he planned a hiatus during which he could train alone on Mount Silver.

At the time that the Elite Four's skills were atrophying, the Kanto gym leaders continued to gain strength. Eventually, Red was the only member of the Elite Four who was stronger than any of the Kanto gym leaders, and when Red left for Mount Silver, the Kanto Gym leaders staged a rebellion. Lorelei and Agatha were either killed or fled into hiding. Bruno, being among the more benevolent rulers of the Elite Four, was allowed to stay. The Kanto gym leaders were not able to defeat Lance's powerful dragons, but after seeing Agatha and Lorelei disappear/get killed, Lance admitted that he had no desire to see the current system continue. The Kanto gym leaders allowed Lance to stay as league champion, and stationed one of their own, Koga, on the new Elite Four. (Koga's daughter, Jasmine, replaced him in the Fuchsia City gym.) Red, meanwhile, continued his training atop Mount Silver. He remained in total isolation until three years later, when he received his first human visitor: a young boy named Gold.

More speculation in response to [this tidbit](http://i.imgur.com/jVf56.png):

The Mewtwo project was an attempt at creating a doomsday weapon to end the war. Lt. Surge's words suggest that the war was fought primarily with Pokemon, so it would make sense that the ""ultimate weapon"" in such a war would be a genetically engineered super-Pokemon.

This is why everyone in Red and Blue's world has Pokemon, including small children. They're seen as a vital means of self-protection in the event of a conflict. (Somewhere, there is a Bill of Rights with a statement reading, ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and train Pokemon shall not be infringed."")

The war was fought between Kanto and Johto. In the events of the gen 1 games, the wounds of this war have not yet healed, and the two remain widely separated. Between the events of the gen 1 games and gen 2 games, this relationship changes, and people are given more freedom to travel between Kanto and Johto.  Johto has substantial infrastructure that obviously didn't just spring up in the three years between RBY and GSC; many areas of Johto seem to have a rich cultural heritage (Mahogany comes to mind).  However, people in Kanto seem to be relatively ignorant of the land to the west in gen 1, largely due to the rift caused by the war between the two regions.  By the time gen 2 rolls around, everyone in Kanto freely acknowledges their neighbors in Johto, with scientists like Bill traveling freely between the two regions.

Mewtwo succeeded in ending the war, though not in the way that Kanto hoped. The Mewtwo project backfired, but the disaster was so widespread that it affected both sides.  While Cinnabar (the site for the Mewtwo project) is pretty far east in Kanto, Bark Town was largely obliterated by the Mewtwo disaster, and it wasn't until years later that ""New Bark Town"" was founded on its remains.  Both sides of the conflict suffered heavy casualties and were forced to unite in order to subdue Mewtwo, putting an end to their conflict.

**Other musings and topics for discussion:**

* Daisy, Blue's sister, clearly warrants explanation. Who is she? Is she related to Professor Oak or Blue in any way? Possible answers: Daisy was the source of the DNA that Oak used in his experiments, Daisy was the result of one of his earlier experiments, Daisy was the daughter of a researcher who died when working on the Mewtwo project...
* How does the Pokemon storage system work? Possible explanation: it is possible to convert Pokemon entirely into data that can be stored electronically and retrieved later, but the compression algorithm must be run on the Pokemon storage system's cloud computing and as such can be performed only from a PC terminal, making it unsuitable for field use. Pokeballs use a simpler compression method, making it possible for Pokemon to pop in and out of them at the blink of an eye.
* For the entire game, it seems like Blue is one step ahead of Red. Blue is the first of the two to visit Bill, he beats Red to Lavander, and he reaches the Elite Four first. I think that he also beats Red to each of the Gyms. (His name, if I recall correctly, is always posted on the ""list of winners at this gym"" that Red sees whenever he walks into a Gym.) This brings up many questions, such as: how did Blue manage to get to Fuchsia before Red if he didn't have the Pokeflute? Moreover, how did he get all of the HMs he needed to do things like Surf to Cinnabar?
* It seems to be common etiquette that in any Pokemon battle between two trainers, the loser forfeits 50% of the money they are carrying. I had originally wanted to play this one by having Red mug trainers after he defeated all of their Pokemon, but it seems to be standard procedure in all directions, as Red loses 50% of his money whenever he loses a battle, and there's also a trainer (a Cue Ball on the biker's path west of Celadon) who says something like ""Be ready to fork over cash when you lose!""
* Schools are an interesting point. In all of first gen, only two trainers make references to school, and both of them are Super Nerds. It's worth noting that Super Nerds in general tend to carry more cash than other juvenile trainers, suggesting the possibility that education might be limited to the privileged and wealthy.  On the other hand, in gen 2 Johto seems to have more trainers which attend school (there is a new trainer class called ""schoolboy""), consistent with the general trend that Johto seems to have better-developed social infrastructure than Kanto.
* The world of Pokemon is absolutely littered with random items. Even areas that are relatively far off the beaten path (like the Seafoam Islands and Unknown Dungeon) have items. In fact, the less-trafficked locations oftentimes have a *higher* density of items than high-traffic areas. This is because when a trainer walks into a dungeon like the Cerulean Cave or Seafoam Islands, the Pokemon there are savage, having had little exposure to humans. When/if all of his Pokemon faint, the feral Pokemon kill and feast upon the defenseless trainer. Eventually, their remains decay, leaving only a collection of items behind. These items become strewn about over time.",high quality,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,quality,,True,t3_10gh7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/10gh7h/a_deconstruction_of_the_firstgeneration_pokemon/,

When each member pass away, their eldest child took their headdress and wore it, part in remembrance, and part to honour tradition. This practice still continues to the present day.

For those of you who haven't seen it, there is a surprise twist at the end when it is revealed that the boy who spent several days travelling with Ash's gang was in fact a young professor Oak who had been transported through time by Celebi. This made me think a little about Professor Oak through the entire anime series and games.
1. Why did Oak actually have a Pikachu prepared when Ash arrived at his lab in the first episode? All the other pokemon labs only have the three regular starters to choose from, but Oak just happened to have a Pikachu. I believe that Oak prepared Ash's pikachu specifically for him because he knew of Ash and Pikachu would eventually get along when he traveled to the future.
2. Why does Oak prefer Ash/Red over his own grandson? The simple answer to this is that the young Samuel Oak became great friends with Ash during their journey with Celebi. He is simply trying to reconnect with a long lost childhood friend.
3. At one point in the course of the film, Ash comments on Sam's sketchbook. He says it's just like a Pokedex. Ash then goes on to explain what the Pokedox is to Sam, and in my opinion, providing Oak with the inspiration to invent the Pokedex.

This idea is based around the ‘poke-kanto war’ conception, and grows off its assertion a war occurred before the Red &amp; Blue games.

Guns and bombs appear nowhere in the game. Users and poke-conspirators alike assume the war used pokemon and humans to fight. I propose a widespread weapon determined the outcome of the war: chemical warfare.  Chemical warfare won the war, killing humans and affecting the regional Pokemon.  The main consideration for this idea: Gen 1 has 33 poison typed Pokemon.

Land plants are often the first organisms affected in a contaminated area, and will adopt the poison during normal nutrient capture.  In the Kanto region, nearly every grass type is a dual type with poison. They are: Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Oddish, Gloom, Vileplume, Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Victreebel. The only grass types in the Kanto region that are not poison are Exeggcute, Exeggutor, Paras, Parasect, and Tangela. 

Poisonous plants/Pokemon then affects the surrounding animals during consumption: Bug types. Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill, Venonat, Venomoth. Up the food chain, creatures consuming the contaminated bugs are affected. Wind carries chemical and poisonous compounds through the air. IRL, Bats consume massive quantities of bugs. (The reason repel exists in the game) The poison/flying type: Zubat and Golbat.

Poison does not stay in one area because rain water carries compounds away. The contaminated run off eventually floods into the ocean and affects the biosphere there. The most abundant pokemon encountered on water: Tentacool, a water/poison type. 

The pokemon killed by the chemical warfare carries the poison even after death: Ghastly, Haunter, and Gengar.

Pokemon types naturally resistant to poison became augmented by the chemical warfare. Rhydon, the powerful Drill Pokemon, a Rock/Ground type, is affected by the poison. Rhydon altered into Nidoking &amp; Nidoqueen, also known as Drill pokemon, share the same egg group, are all artistically similar to each other, and their prior evolutions are only found in the safari zone.

Nidoking and Nidoqueen exchange their rock/ground into ground/poison and those offspring lose the ground type as a result of the poison contamination.  Nidoking and Nidoqueen do not occur naturally in the Kanto region. An additional moonstone is necessary to evolve Nidorino and Nidorina and reintroduce the ground type back. Nidoran are small enough to escape the safari zone and roam route 22.

Further chemical warfare evidence:
Koffing and Weezing are pure poison types artistically styled after landmines.
Muk and Grimer are living sludge. Sentient sludge that thrives off of polluted factory waste. A by-product of the creation of the chemical weapons.
The Indigo plateau, the “pokemon authority”, is a shade of Purple, the same color of poison!!

Kanto arguably has the most cities among the other regions, such as the massive Celedon and Saffron Cities. Cinnabar's DNA Lab and Pokemon like Voltorb, Mewtwo, Magnemite, and Porygon reflect the human influence on Kanto. The existence of the mafia, Team Rocket, and gambling represent some issues that come with the urban environment. 

-Generation II is about Japanese culture. This is most blatant in Ecruteak City, with the geisha girls and the pagodas. Ho-oh is also commonly compared to the Japanese depiction of the Phoenix, versus Moltres, which is the Arabian/Western version. Maybe Cianwood could be Okinawa? 

-Generation III is meant to teach the player about geology, oceanography, and the general natural environment. This can be seen in the detailed descriptions in the Slateport Museum, the glass-maker, the space center, and numerous other places. It's also notable that the legendaries and plot regards the environment, as well as the inclusion of Castform.  

-Generation IV is meant to teach players about theology. This is seen in most legendaries in the game and the main plot, as it's about a cult. Giratina may represent not just Satan, but any other ""dark"" character of religious mythology, such as Hades/Pluto, Shiva, or Samael. Likewise, Arceus represents a creator, such as Yaweh, Adonai, or Brahma. The other Sinnoh legends, such as the Lake Trio and Palkia/Dialga, could be further expansions to Sinnoh mythology as a religious model, sharing their places with the likes of Gabriel, Ganesh, etc. There's also the conspicuously silent church in Hearthome City, full of people spouting profound phrases.

-Gen V is about international story-telling. The entire plot is about heroes and conflicting ideals.

In pokemon 2nd generation, you can after you beat every kanto champions accede to mount silver. The reason explained in the game is that the pokemons in that region are particularly strong and so only an exceptional trainer can go there without being in danger.

There, you will meet 4 people: nurse joy, an old lady, a girl in a hidden house and red.

We all obviously know that red is the previous league champion and the reason why nurse joy is there so I talk about the two others.

The girl in her house is trying to flee celebrity and lives with her fearow.

The reason is simple: in a country where almost everyone is a pokemon trainer, being a league champion puts you to the rank of superstar. But she couldn't live it and so flew away with her extremely strong and favorite  pokemon fearow that now defends her from any pokemons of the region.

The old lady in the pokemon center isn't a simple old lady. She talks about the trainers who try climbing mount silver and ends her sentence  with ""..."".

In the beginning of the game, when the professor introduces you ''to the world of pokemon'', you are actually using the computer and accessing the trainer webpage designed for 10-something year olds. Hence the simple layout, the need to input your name, your gender etc. The professor shown is mostly a full body shot, so most probably it is not a webcam interaction, but a feature on the webpage.

After all the information is put in, it is then generated onto a form, and sent to the closest professor from the place of origin. The professor then has details about the new trainer, and either: 

a)summons the new trainer to his lab to give him his pokemon if the trainer lives in the same town, or 

b) the professor pay the new trainer a visit if he's not in the professor's town, as in the case of diamond and pearl, where the professor is traveling around.

Other than that, guess where you are the first time you have control over your character: in your room. what's in the room? the computer.

this theory can be further supported in diamond/pearl/platinum, as even after doing the registration, the professor does not seem to know who you are. the solution: professor rowan was on a trip that day, and did not have any access to his computer, so he did not see the registration forms the main character and barry (oh you silly barry) put in. however, since the trainer registration is designed to be simple, and he saw the kids actually trying to run to his town, he would have assumed that they have already sent in their registration, but were too impatient/thought they weren't chosen to be an official trainer.

On that note, this theory will further support that the starter pokemon are only given out to chosen trainers by the government/elite 4/whoever. this would mean the elite 4/government/whoever actually chooses who to give their special breed of starters to, and the process is simply through online registration. 

For those who failed to be chosen by the elite 4/government/whatever, they resort to having a certified trainer start them up by giving them a pokemon. Hence you find trainers with local pokemon you can find in the backyard, and the occasional trainer with a starter.

This is when it evolves into Kadabra. Eventually, like most Pokemon, Kadabra will start to trust it's trainer, and fight for him/her happily.

Now, Kadabra can only be evolved through a trade. This is because, when traded, they are suddenly forced to belong to a new human.

1350196530.0,347,self.pokemonconspiracies,11g9s1,Professor Oak's Past and his Parcel (full post as requested),412,65,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11g9s1/professor_oaks_past_and_his_parcel_full_post_as/,"I wrote a response to what I thought the origin of [Oak's Parcel] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11bztr/oaks_parcel_whats_really_inside/) really was, and the post was rather lengthy.  After getting feedback from a bunch of very nice readers, I bring you all the story I wrote in that post:

There was a time when Oak was a young trainer, using apricorns as pokeballs. While venturing through the woods, Oak came across a small abandoned Pokémon he had never seen before, one that was all alone and asleep in a soft pile of uprooted grass. The Pokémon had clearly not eaten for a few days, so Oak set food upon the ground in front of the little fellow. The Pokémon ate it instantly, and glared at Oak. Without a second thought, Oak quickly captures the small pokémon to bring him home and nurture him. Oak runs home to his room, and immediately lets his new friend out of the pokeball, and meets him officially for the first time. This is what he says:


""Hi there! Welcome to the world of people! My name is Oak! Others call me the Pokémon Kid! This world is inhabited by creatures called humans, and we live alongside you! For some people, Pokémon are pets. Other use them for fights. Myself… I just wanna learn as much as I can about you little fellas! Will you help me learn, new friend?""


Puzzled, the Pokémon looks around the room, seeing posters of various other Pokémon beside these creatures known as people. He then looks to Oak, scared at first, but sees the innocence and happiness on Oak's young face. The Pokémon crawls into Oak's lap and looks at him. Soon enough, Oak holds the small creature like a child and sings him a lullaby. The Pokémon is fast asleep.


In the following days, Oak makes a habit of writing down everything the Pokémon does, from his eating habits to where he likes to roam outdoors. Soon enough, Oak fills an entire journal on his friend as well as an illustration of himself and the Pokémon together.


""Book one complete!"" he says, and begins a new journal to continue his research on the pokémon he calls Friend.


Oak and Friend venture through the forest, observing reactions of the other pokémon as Friend approaches them. Oak also sketches the pokemon he sees, so that he may capture them at a later date for further research. As the years go on, Oak and Friend make a record of every other pokémon they interact with, eventually dedicating an entire journal to drawings of each pokémon they met along the way.


More years pass, faster than either of them had anticipated, and new pokeballs are invented. Upon showing Friend the new pokeballs, Oak sees that his old apricorn is good enough for Friend to reside in, and lets him have his way. Tired from a hard days work capturing three unique pokémon, Oak sits at his desk, Friend in his lap, and sings a lullaby. Friend is fast asleep.


Many more years come and go, resulting in Oak becoming an official Pokémon Professor! The invention of a device called a ""Pokémon Dex"" allow Oak and Friend to compile all of their journals digitally! Oak and Friend celebrate, eating cake and rare candies from another town. Friend suddenly undergoes a change too, he's evolving!


Now larger, Friend is almost too big to lie down on Oak's lap, but Oak picks him up and puts him there anyway and the two fall asleep, while Oak hums a lullaby.


A new family is in town, they say they have a young boy, his name is Red! Oak and Friend are ecstatic and cannot wait to find out when the boy will become a trainer, but his Mother tells them he is too young for now.


Four years pass, Oak is old, and so is Friend. The two spend most of their time together, sitting behind the Laboratory, watching the bird pokémon that they had discovered fly overhead. Oak looks at Friend and sees a very solemn look in his eye, a sort of accomplished look that only an old man such as himself might have. Friend then looks at Oak, distinguished, but aged, and Oak immediately knows what this means.


Once more, Oak lifts up Friend, carries him inside, and sits at his desk with Friend on his lap. Oak holds Friend like a child, and looks him in the eyes. With his arms cradling Friend, Oak begins to sing a lullaby, more lovingly than he had ever done before. He rocks Friend back and forth despite the size of him, then Friend's gaze begins to fade, his eyes close, and Friend slowly falls asleep, for the last time.


Tears swell up in Oak's eyes and roll down his face, falling heavily upon Friend's chest. Oak cradles Friend's head with his hand and touches his forehead to his own. Oak then kisses his pokémon gently and sincerely on the forehead, and cradles him closer to his chest, as if he were the young friend he met all those years ago. In a choked voice, Oak whispers in Friend's ear:


""You will always be my Friend.""


Oak receives a telephone call from his grandson, asking if he could come over later. Oak simply says ""Yes. Later,"" and hangs up. Oak calls the nearest Pokémon Center, telling them what has happened and they inform him to bring Friend there, in his original pokeball. Oak returns Friend to the old apricorn, and begins his walk to the center. However, on his way there he sees a young boy about to run into the tall grass! It's the young boy from years ago! Quickly, Oak stops him, explaining that he needs a Pokémon as a friend to protect him. Oak drags the boy, Red, to his laboratory and lets him choose one of the pokémon that he and Friend had caught previously. Oak's grandson barges in and witnesses the boy choosing first. Oak's grandson chooses the other, and the two young ones battle. While doing so, Oak makes his journey to the Pokémon center. As he is standing at the counter, Oak realizes how much the boy Red reminds him of himself, and in a way his grandson Blue does too. Waking from his daydream, Oak finds that the Nurse is attempting to get his attention. He holds out the box containing Friend's apricorn and informs her that he is inside, mentioning that the pokeball is very old.


""That's no problem sir, and please, come back soon. We will have it ready in a few hours. My condolences to you, I wish we could have helped.""


""There's nothing that could have been done, he was... ready.""


Oak returns to the laboratory looking over all of the documents that he and Friend had compiled, as well as the ""Pokémon Dex"" he had invented to become a professor. Soon enough, Red and Blue come in and Oak sees that Red is holding his Parcel.

""Ah! This is the custom Pokéball I ordered. Thank you very much for bringing this Red!""

Oak turns and places the parcel on his desk, opening the box, first silent then awestruck. The apricorn he once knew was fashioned into a stone re-creation. On the top, the word ""Friend"" was engraved with a capital F. He knew that the nurse at the center had done it just as a show of respect, but the coincidence was fated. The stone apricorn was beautifully crafted and the sight of it made Oak tear up once more. He looks again at his Pokémon Dex, and back at all of his research.


""This is what he would have wanted.""


Wiping the tears from his face, he turns to face Red and Blue, Pokémon Dexes in hand.


""This is a high-tech encyclopedia called the PokéDex. I'm getting old, and as much as I would like to fill it with information, I find it better that you two do it. So please, take these with you.""


After the two leave, Oak sits at his desk and admires the stone ball that Friend now forever sleeps in. Once again, he is overcome with sadness and grief at the loss of his companion, he lost the one thing that mattered most to him. As he looks around the room, remembering the time he and Friend had spent together, Oak's eyes fall upon the last remaining pokemon on the table.


Picking up the pokeball, Oak unintentionally releases the creature from it's home. It is green, soft like grass, and very happy. The pokemon looks up in anticipation as Oak crouches down to its level. Before Oak can even bring himself to sit down, the creature leaps into his lap, causing Oak to stumble slightly backward, now sitting on the floor. The pokemon nestles itself on Oak's warm lap. Oak cradles the pokemon in his arms, and says:


""You remind me of a very close Friend of mine.""


Hugging him close to his chest, Oak rocks the pokemon back and forth, and sings him a lullaby. The Pokémon is fast asleep.

1341857778.0,332,self.pokemonconspiracies,wa5ff,Shocking Revelation About Ash's Father,408,76,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wa5ff/shocking_revelation_about_ashs_father/,"A tale of one man's guilt, a family reunited, and the greatest cover up Pallet Town has ever seen. On this episode of *The Oak Files*...

**Pikachu is Ash’s father.**

This is obviously just for fun, but hear me out on this one:

**The Story:**

Ash’s father was a friend of Professor Oak’s in Pallet Town, much like Ash is now. While working on a risky experiment involving a Pikachu (as a power source or as the specimen), Ash’s father somehow got in the way of the experiment and his soul/essence was placed inside the Pikachu, leaving his own body either dead and empty or replaced by the Pikachu’s essence, which would make him seem crazed and/or deranged. Oak panicked and because of his close relationship with Delia (his student’s wife), he hid the body (in either state) and claimed that Ash’s father had gone off to “continue his adventure as a Trainer” and then hid away the Pikachu in shame or fear. However, as he knew Ash when he was a [child himself] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M04), Oak knows that Ash will eventually have a Pikachu and decides to give him the one from the failed experiment. Whether Oak knows the identity of Ash’s Pikachu as his father is irrelevant. Either way, he wound up giving the Pikachu to Ash because he knows that Ash will own a Pikachu in the future.
 
Once released from the Pokeball, the Pikachu attacks randomly and even makes fun of Ash. He may have temporary memory loss at this stage or he may just be very scared and not in control of his new body outside a Pokeball. Upon getting to know Ash and Delia better, he may remember his past and decides that he doesn’t need to be afraid, as his family still loves him. Here, we can argue that Delia may know the true identity of Ash’s Pikachu. If she (as a student and friend of Oak’s) also knew about the experiment, she may have her guesses as to why the Pikachu is so special and where her husband really went. If this is the case, she decided to let Ash start his Pokemon journey despite her motherly fears because she knows he is in good hands with his father. 
 
Because he has a human’s soul and knowledge, Ash’s Pikachu is stronger and kinder because he can think abstractly about things and doesn't rely solely on his trainer. He also dislikes Pokeballs because he is a human unused to the Pokeball procedure and prefers the freedom to be with his son. Although he can never truly signify who he really is, Ash's father is still able to protect and teach his son throughout the young trainer's adventure. 
 
**The ""Proof"":**
 
* In Latin America, Cartoon Network has a ""Biografia Toon"" (Toon Biography) segment, which consists of biographies and histories of cartoon characters. According to the segment, Pikachu is the result of an experiment conducted by Professor Oak and allegedly destroyed the lab where he was created in a momentary loss of control. 
* Delia knew Spencer Hale, another student of Professor Oak’s and she obviously cared for him as seen in the third Pokemon [movie] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M03). From this information, we can construe that she may have known other students/trainers familiar with Professor Oak and perhaps fell in love with and married one of them. 
* Pikachu and Delia are fond of each other and Pikachu gives her more attention than Ash or his other Pokemon at many of their reunions. Also, we can see at least one instance of Pikachu [fondling] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qijIUY014k) Delia. This fondness may be because Delia is aware of Pikachu’s true identity (or is guessing) or because Pikachu makes the extra effort to be nice to her.
* According to [Bulbapedia] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash%27s_Pikachu), Pikachu has a set language for many repeated words. He also seems to understand human speech and body language better than other Pokemon.
* Unlike most of Ash’s other Pokemon, Pikachu acts in a fatherly role to others, namely Togapi and Axew. He is also very mature and is usually the leader when Ash isn’t around. He often tries to “talk things out” with others before he fights, as seen in [Pikachu’s Vacation] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/PK01) while the others simply want to battle.
* Pikachu has a particular dislike of Team Rocket’s Meowth as seen [here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxuDaC5Nvkg). He deliberately wants to cause him and Jessie and James harm, as he is protecting Ash. Other characters don’t seem to have such a strong reaction to Team Rocket, not even Ash.
* Ash and Pikachu have very similar personalities – eager to fight and test themselves against others, but just as eager to meet new friends and help each other. This may be because they share genetics.
* Pikachu is incredibly loyal to Ash and even decides to keep traveling with him instead of staying with other Pikachu in [Pikachu’s Goodbye] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP039), despite many of Ash’s other Pokemon deciding to stay behind or be freed in similar situations.
* Pikachu does not want to evolve. Because of the radical physical changes that take place in Pokemon (as well as possible mental ones, as displayed by Ash’s Charmeleon), Ash’s father may be afraid to evolve as his essence may disappear forever.
* Pikachu has an odd fondness for ketchup, a food otherwise reserved for humans. This may be due to Ash’s father remembering eating ketchup as a human. It would be a rare condiment on their camping adventures, so he revels in its flavor and memories whenever he can get it.
* **EDIT** Pikachu is the first to cry (even before Ash's human friends) in the first Pokemon movie when Ash is turned to stone and ""dies"" (as suggested by TheSystemer).
* **EDIT** Other characters in the Pokeverse have been transformed into Pokemon, as seen when Bill is turned into a Clefairy in R/B/Y/FR/LG (as suggested by EpicDonutsistaken).

**TL;DR** Ash’s father didn’t abandon his son, instead his essence was accidentally transferred into a Pikachu and he is now Ash’s closest companion.

 Wally, however, was sick, so perhaps Norman just felt sorry for him. And maybe Wally was sicker than the player realized.

 Wally's sickness varies throughout the game - he's pretty sick at the beginning, and seems to get better throughout the game. Then, suddenly, in Victory Road - he's fine. He doesn't bring his illness up again. Every time you battle him, he gets a little stronger as well, but he's always in Victory Road.

 Wally wasn't actually getting better in those times you battled him - he was dying, and his symptoms were dying down. Because he doesn't have a Water-type on his team, or a Pokémon with Fly, his parents pay for him to go to Ever Grande City so he can battle with you a final time.

1338165502.0,289,self.pokemonconspiracies,u7z7m,Gary is the protagonist; Ash is his rival,344,55,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u7z7m/gary_is_the_protagonist_ash_is_his_rival/,"In most of the games, after you choose your starter Pokemon, your rival will always choose whatever your Pokemon's weak against (exceptions are Yellow, which forces Eevee and Pikachu, and Black/White, which have two rivals). 

Logically, any spin-offs should follow this formula. The manga does -- Red starts with Bulbasaur (and his Poliwhirl) while Blue starts with Charmander. However, the anime doesn't. Because Ash is late, Gary gets to pick his Pokemon first. It's later revealed that he chose Squirtle, which, of course, is weak against the Pikachu Ash winds up with.

What does this mean? Well, we're not following the true protagonist**. At least, not as far as the game formula is concerned. Ash chose a Pokemon that Gary's is weak to; therefore, Gary is the one who represents the player. Gary is always besting Ash at everything because, as the ""player,"" he is almost guaranteed to succeed. Meanwhile, Ash is constantly struggling with the basic concepts of Pokemon battles. Sure, he does all right and he tries quite hard (and even shows improvement through the first few seasons), but, just like Blue in the games, he can never really come out on top.

This mainly only applies until Gary chooses to become a Pokemon researcher because, at that point, he's basically completed his ""game.""

This is a very brief thought, so feel free to add onto it, debate it, etc. I know Ash doesn't exactly fail at *everything* since he's the one that the anime follows, but since the general consensus is that he's pretty bad, I figure it holds some water, at least.

**I'm using the term protagonist very loosely here. Think of it more as ""character that most represents the player character from the games,"" but not ten words long.

**EDIT:** After some discussion, I've made a couple amendments to help the theory remain believable.

First, it seems to make more sense if it's thought of as a writer decision, as Ash doesn't exactly get a choice about Pikachu. However, the writers could have chosen to give Gary any starter (or none, really), but they opted for him to start with Squirtle without any obvious driving factors (Blue has Charmander in the manga, so there isn't even that).

Second, we could look at it as both Ash and Gary representing different types of players. That is, Ash represents the more casual, emotionally-invested player who cares more about exploring the world and playing with his favourites than going for the quick win; Gary represents the more calculating player who looks at stats, type match-ups, etc. in order to ensure a quick, easy victory. Something like casual versus tournament players.

**EDIT 2:** It's been brought up a few times that Ash didn't get to see which Pokemon Gary chose and, therefore, didn't pick Pikachu for its type advantage. As I mentioned in the first edit, this makes it seem more like it was a writer choice that something that occurred ""in-universe."" There's discussion about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u7z7m/gary_is_the_protagonist_ash_is_his_rival/c4t6m18) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u7z7m/gary_is_the_protagonist_ash_is_his_rival/c4t6ljr).

But after looking at some numbers and doing a little research, I think Ash is actually just the right age. Just bare with me for a moment because this could get pretty long.
The first thing to point out is that Ash actually does appear a little taller in the new X/Y series, which is what sparked my curiosity, but let's put that aside. Anyway to the numbers I mentioned, including the specials there are roughly around 803 episodes and 16 movies following Ash's journey. The important thing to pay attention to though is that most of the episodes all take place over the course of a single day, sometimes two, with no indication of time passing between episodes. In fact there are a quite a few cases where multiple episodes all occur with the same day (namely league battles, gym battles, arcs dealing with legendaries, etc.), but most of these may be cancelled out from the few time skips we do have (The three months before the Indigo League perhaps) so it's safe to assume that roughly 800-850 days have passed in the world of the anime since the time it began, which translates to about 2 years, add the possibility of unseen time and we could be looking at 3 years tops.
Now Ash began his journey at exactly 10 years, 10 months, and 10 days old as confirmed in the novelization of the show, making him almost 11 at that time (Also fun fact I found that since it's said trainers get their Pokemon in April of their 10th year, assuming that Ash began on April 1st, that would make his birthday November 21.) This would mean that in the the Black and White anime series, Ash would be no older than 13 going on 14, a prime age for many young men to experience there growth spurts, hence his new height in X/Y, and it would also explain why he is so short in comparison to N, as an Article in the magazine PASH! estimates N to be about 20 years old and is 5'11"". Naturally a still developing 13 year old would appear dwarfed next to a fully grown man of 20.
Let's also take note of the voice actor change a few years ago, I know it may be trivial seeing as it was more of a production thing, but is does help my conspiracy theory a bit. Looking at the age time line again, when the special Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon first aired (In America first no less), and Ash's voice actor changed becoming slightly deeper, he would have been traveling for about one year at this point making him about 12, the perfect age for someone's voice to crack.
Now as a bit of a side thing, I wanted to defend Ash's forgetfulness of Pokemon he already knows and his reliance on the Pokedex. Pokemon knowledge is Ash's world would be similar to math or science in ours, constantly present and taught in school. So given how natural a Bulbasaur is in his world, Ash naturally would not know everything about it just because he's used one. I own a cat but that doesn't mean I know about its digestive track. Ash is still young and has been taking in a lot of new information at a break neck speed through his travels, so it makes perfect sense that he would on occasion need a refresher on how things work even if he's used it in the past. Besides Dexter already told us he wasn't the brightest back in episode one.
So that's that, adding all this together and looking at Ash's new height in X/Y, his ignorance around all his female companions, his voice changing, facial changes the idea of Ash not aging is not true in the least, the problem was people were attributing his age to our time progression and not the time of his world..... Also I just realized that I went out of my way to research the age of an anime character for no reason.... wow.",Specific People,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,reserved6,,True,t3_1kd5l5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1kd5l5/ashs_age_explained/,

1342816964.0,287,self.pokemonconspiracies,ww4v9,"Why most in-game trainers have less than 6 Pokémon, and why being a trainer would be a risky business. ",330,43,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/ww4v9/why_most_ingame_trainers_have_less_than_6_pokémon/,"A buddy of mine brought this up: How come you fight so many trainers in any given Pokémon game, but most of them only have like two or three Pokémon and not a full team?

We discussed this for a good hour, thinking of as many practical reasons as we could, and here is what we came up with. (Note: this is all fan speculation)

First of all, we figured that most people who own Pokémon are not licensed league trainers. Sure, most people would own a Pokémon, take care of it, train it a little, but if they were all real people, they have to get money and pay bills just like everyone else. Most in habitants of the Pokémon world like Pokémon but are probably not interested in getting badges or collecting a lot of living breathing animals and teaching them to control their awesome powers.

Next, Pokémon training is expensive. A trainer has to take care of his Pokémon and his/her own person. He/she needs to eat as does his/her Pokémon, and buy necessary healing supplies, all while not having a steady income. You make money by channeling other trainers, so if you lose a battle you may lose the means to eat that week. Losing money in a battle also means losing money to buy Pokéballs, so the option to get more Pokémon vanishes if you lose too often.

And if you don’t have someone give you a starter, you have to get one yourself, which can be really dangerous. Take Youngster Joey for instance. Bug Pokémon in his neck of the woods are generally of low level. Joey can catch a Caterpie and Metapod no problem. But what if he runs into an aggressive and territorial Beedrill? The poor boy may get hurt. If he has a Pokémon and it faints, what is stopping the Beedrill from attacking Joey next (if it were all real)? Now imagine this same trainer trying to catch an Ekans or a Nidorino? If this was real, catching wild Pokémon may be incredibly risky and this probably deters a lot of people from entering the league.

Then there is traveling. Pokémon trainers walk a lot because that’s where the Pokémon are; back-roads, forests, oceans, etc. Traveling is expensive and time consuming, and leaving home is stressful enough without having to worry about weather, the dangerous conditions of sleeping outside, getting robbed by Rockets or whoever else, and wild Pokémon. It is safer to stay close to home and catch the Pokémon in your backyard, which is probably why some trainers have three Geodudes or two Tentacools. And again, Pokéballs cost money, so it’s probably hard for the average wage slave to buy some Pokéballs, walk around a lot and find a unique little monster to add to his party.

But worst of all…there is no promise you will succeed in your career. In the game, you just train as hard as you can until you are tough enough to beat the next challenge. If it were real, battling would be more like poker: you play until you are out of money. The Pokémon Center may be free, but you have to fork over your hard earned money every time you lose a battle. That’s how trainers make their living. There are probably many, many trainers who dreamed of being the champion but fell short of that goal. Maybe that is why you can encounter a Pokéfan playing with their kid and they have a level 40 Yanma. Level 40 is exactly how far they got before they couldn’t go on.

So we concluded that being a trainer is a hard as hell profession, one that (like acting) has many more failure stories than success stories.

I love my friends.

If you can get through the whole thing, congrats :) (seriously)



So, we need to start at the beginning. Literally. We have an egg, and from it, hatched Arceus. I’ll explain later how the egg got there. Arceus is in a void, Chaos basically. From the Chaos, Arceus created Dialga, Ruler of Time, Palkia, Ruler of Space, and Giratina, Ruler of Antimatter. Giratina was sent to an alternate dimension, where Chaos rules. Dialga and Palkia begin to shape the cosmos, and worlds. Arceus, meanwhile, is creating other Pokemon. Mew is the first “official” one. Mew can, as we know, learn any move, as well as create other Pokemon from its DNA. Once Dialga and Palkia finished with the cosmos, Arceus created Lati@s, to search Space, to see if anything that Dialga and Palkia made had brought forth life. Many years pass, and the Eon Pokemon return with Deoxys.



Deoxys’s DNA, in combination with Mew’s, helped to form hundreds of Pokemon. But where to put them? While Lati@s was searching the cosmos, Arceus had created Groudon and Kyogre, to create land and seas. They did so, but could not be contained; their power was too great. Arceus brought Rayquaza forth, to have the ability to calm them. Arceus and Rayquaza sent Groudon and Kyogre into deep sleeps, hoping that they would never be unleashed upon the world again. The Sky Pillar was built for Rayquaza to keep the weather in the Hoenn region safe. Meanwhile, Arceus created Regigigas, to move the landmasses to their current position. Afterwards, it was sent into a deep sleep in the northern most reaches of the Sinnoh region.



Back to Deoxys and Mew. They created hundreds of Pokemon. But what was the first one? Heatran. It’s the only legendary that can be either male or female. This is because Deoxys and Mew were experimenting with DNA. After seeing Heatran’s incredible power, being able to melt through walls and all, they concluded if they were to make legendary Pokemon, they shouldn't breed; one legendary in the world is “bad” enough. Pokemon are sent out from them all over the world. But the problem is not many are surviving. The world is barren, and bleak, as no life has grown from Groudon’s rocks it created. So Shaymin is born from Arceus. It brings life to the world. This gives the Pokemon an area to thrive. But, only certain Pokemon were equipped to handle certain areas. This is why only some Pokemon are found in some regions compared to all of them.



As more Pokemon are being created, some evolve into bigger, better forms. One of these evolutions was the crossing of a Mr. Mime, and a Jynx (don’t ask how). This resulted in a baby human. Unexpected, but brought forth into the world. Humans began to live alongside Pokemon, but not as Trainers (at first). They saw themselves equal in the Pokemons eyes. Some humans began to use tools, and soon cities and structures came to be. Arceus, seeing Man had now stepped out from the Pokemon line that they came from, gave them the 3 Regis, as ways to make other tools, and learn more about the Pokemon they came from. Man did so, but feared the Regis, and the power they had. Groups of Men locked them away, so they wouldn’t learn from Pokemon about the past anymore.



The land was flourishing, and Man is becoming more powerful. But what about other legendaries? Surely Mew/Deoxys or Arceus created more, right? Yes, we know this to be the case, but when? The Unown, not a true legendary, was given in part to Man from Arceus, in an attempt to better communicate between Man and Pokemon. Unfortunately, Man created its own alphabet, similar to the Unown, but not similar enough for Pokemon to recognize. Arceus sent the Unown to the realm of Giratina, for them to stay. Problem was the that Unown weren’t “cooperating”, we’ll say, and they made a separate dimension for themselves. It is a mirror of the Pokemon world, but it crosses over sometimes. Those crossing overs occur in the Tanoby Ruins, the Ruins of Alph, and the Solaceon Ruins. Jirachi was born from the creation of the cosmos by Dialga and Palkia. But the Lati@s couldn’t find it, because it was riding on a comet. Jirachi comes down to Earth once every 1000 years, to grant the wish of either a Man, or a Pokemon. This is how the legend of Jirachi was formed. The lake guardians were created by Arceus, as a backup to Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. They not only embody knowledge, emotion, and willpower, but also can interact with Man, trying to express their embodiments into their minds. Men were fearful of this, and in doing so, the lake trio went to their respective caves in Sinnoh to mediate, and wait until needed. Mew and Deoxys also created Manaphy, as a guardian of not only the sea, but of Kyogre as well. Manaphy, unfortunately, can breed, so Mew and Deoxys made sure that it wouldn’t be the same as Manaphy, hence Phione coming into existence.



Back to the story of Man. As Man is evolving, it occasionally mixed technology into Pokemon. The first incident was with what Man called Genesect. Man feared this Pokemon for its sheer ferocity, and hunted it into extinction. It is revived later by Plasma, as we know, and is upgraded even more. The second time Man messes with technology and Pokemon is hundreds of years later, with Apricorns. The first “Pokeballs” were created from different forms of the Apricorn berry, found exclusive to the Johto region. Soon, Unova began to develop technology to mass produce these Pokeballs, becoming the region of extreme growth and wealth. They began to make synthetic forms of the Apricorns, developing the Pokeballs into what they are today. But Man was greedy, and tried to make a huge price for the Pokeballs, since none of the other regions could mass produce them like Unova could. Zekrom and Reshiram, the guardians of Unova, both took different sides of the matter, resulting in the fighting that tore them apart. Kyurem was to reunite them at one point, but only when Man had learned from its mistakes.



Quick side note: During the growth of Man and Pokemon, there wasn’t much weather, due to Rayquaza’s overwhelming power. Arceus brought forth Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus, to create weather for the world. However, Tornadus and Thundurus had “free-reign”, so to speak, and brought havoc on the Pokemon world. Landorus, along with Rayquaza, punished them, keeping them under check. This is also why rain and lighting (aside from certain areas in the games) only last for a short period of time. Also, Man was superstitious about natural events, like the full and new moons. To fulfill the superstitions, Mew and Deoxys created Cresselia for the full moon and Darkrai for the new moon. Unfortunately, Darkrai had the power to create nightmares. This wasn’t planned by Mew and Deoxys. To counter this, Cresselia was given the power to create good dreams.



Now, Man has Pokeballs, and is starting to train Pokemon as their own. But, sometimes Man overstepped their bounds on the land of Pokemon. To prevent Man from fully ridding the world of the natural habitat, Arceus created the Swords of Justice: Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion. They protected wild Pokemon, but where they lived was attacked by Man. More on this in a second.



Man messed with technology and Pokemon a third time. This resulted in the Pokemon War. How did this start? This has been long debated, but I think I found a semi-viable source. The Swords of Justice had a place where they stayed. Man got a group together that was fairly powerful, the most powerful Trainers of the time, and attacked them.  Sensing trouble, Mew and Deoxys created Keldeo. There wasn’t enough time to get Keldeo fully grown like the rest of the trio, so Mew and Deoxys super-charged Keldeo, and it saved the Swords before they died. This action resulted in the beginning of the Pokemon War. Pokemon fought against Man constantly, some getting captured and being forced to battle against their comrades. Kanto was the hardest hit in the war. Man had bases in Victory Road, the Power Plant, and the Seafoam Islands. Arceus, wanting to get Man out of these areas, created the bird trio, and had them attack the respective areas. The birds, after driving Man out of the areas, remained there, in case Man came back. But the War didn’t end with those bases being destroyed. Lugia was created by Arceus to control the birds, and Ho-oh was created as an attacker to the Johto region. Small areas were destroyed in Johto, but one of the key places attacked was the Brass Tower, the resting place of Lugia. Ho-oh accidentally attacked it, and burned it to the ground. This posed a huge problem. In the tower were 3 Pokemon, the evolutions of Eevee to be exact. They went to the tower to pray to Arceus to end the war, but were burned with the tower to the ground. Ho-oh saw the mistake, and resurrected them with superior forms of their prior selves. This is how the legendary beasts came to be. They didn't leave the tower, because they were waiting for the right Trainer to let them roam the world. Once released, this is why they run all over Johto: their previous forms had memories of the regions; they don’t have memories now, and run around the world to recollect them.



The war isn't over yet, but it is close. To solidify the end of the war, Arceus creates Meloetta, having it use its song to calm the world from the war. This great sacrifice causes the war to end, but has it lost its song forever, only remembered in the minds of the people. Almost all legendaries go to sleep, save a few, like Ho-oh, to wander the world, Mew, who is journeying the world to see what it has created, and Rayquaza, to keep watch on the weather. Peace is back in the world of Pokemon. For now.



A boy is born. He doesn't know much before he becomes a Trainer, but after he is born, Giovanni gets a hold of Mew DNA. He assembles scientists, and creates Mewtwo, about 5 years before Red becomes of age to be a Pokemon Trainer. Mewtwo escapes, and hides in Cerulean Cave, where only the strongest Trainers dare to go. In attempts to recreate Mew and a safer form of Mewtwo, scientists keep playing with Mew’s DNA, and end up creating Ditto instead. This is about 3 years before Red is a Trainer. Once Red is of age, he starts owing every Trainer and Gym Leader in his path to the Championship. He beats Blue for the crown, but keeps searching for greater challenges. He captures all the legendary birds, giving Kanto the power (electrical in this case) to reconnect with Johto, as well as capturing Mewtwo. He heads to Mt. Silver, in order to seek a greater Trainer than him.



In this self-induced reclusion, Red gets even more powerful. Arceus is aware of this, and creates Victini, a Pokemon powerful enough to keep people with “bad intentions” from reaching those intentions. Victini is close by when Gold battles Red, just in case Red does win, and become the most powerful Trainer ever. Victini is there to kill Red, if needed, but we know that doesn't happen.



So, remember the egg that I referenced at the beginning of this theory? Wondering how it got there? This occurs in the future, hundreds of years after the events of Gold and Red. The world is dying, and Arceus knows this. In the closing moments of the world, not having the power to stop the end of everything, Arceus creates two things: an egg, containing itself, and Celebi. Celebi is the time traveler, and in the last moments of the world, transports itself back to the beginning of the universe, to let the cycle begin once again. Celebi then goes back to different points in the future, thus making it possible for there to be not only multiple Celebis, but also shiny Celebis.



TL;DR: There’s literally no way to sum this all up quickly, so I’ll try my best. Arceus creates the universe, with the Creation trio in their respective areas.  Lati@s searched the cosmos for life, and found Deoxys. Deoxys and Mew created almost all Pokemon, save a couple legendaries. Groudon and Kyogre created the Earth, and Shaymin created the life for the Earth. Pokemon flourished, and through a cross-breed of Mr. Mime and Jynx, Man was created. The Unown were the link between Man and Pokemon, via a written language, but Man altered the alphabet just enough to not have a link between Pokemon and Man. The Unown created their own dimension, which crosses over into the Pokemon world where the Unown can be found in the games (also the reason why the ruins “never run out” of Unown). Man creates superstitions of the moon, and Deoxys and Mew created the lunar duo to fulfill the superstitions. The Kami trio was created for weather in the world, and Manaphy is created to protect the oceans and Kyogre. Man causes Genesect to become extinct through extreme hunting, which is revived and souped-up by Team Plasma. Man creates the first Pokeballs from Apricorns, first established in the Johto region. Unova creates a near monopoly of Pokeballs, creating a rift of power in the region. Zekrom and Reshiram take sides, and fight, tearing the region apart. Kyurem would reunite with one of them to restore balance. The Swords of Justice, minus Keldeo, are made to keep Man from overriding the land of Pokemon. Man attacks where the Swords of Justice are, and are saved by Keldeo. The Pokemon War starts because of this. The bird trio is created by Arceus to destroy bases Man has set up in Victory Road, the Seafoam Islands, and the Power Plant. The birds are ruled by Lugia, and Ho-oh rules the skys. It accidentally attacks the Brass Tower (Burned Tower know afterwards), and kills the 3 known Eeveelutions, that were praying to Arceus inside the tower, by accident. Ho-oh rejuvenates them as the beast trio. Pokemon War ends by Meloetta’s song, which leaves it forever. Mew, Ho-oh, and Rayquaza are the only legendaries that don’t go to sleep after the war ends. Giovanni gets a hold of Mew DNA, creates Mewtwo, about 5 years before Red is of age to be a Pokemon Trainer. Mewtwo escapes, goes to Cerulean Cave, and scientists create Ditto from attempts to make a “better” Mewtwo. Red begins his journey, kicks ass, captures the bird trio (giving electricity back to Kanto), and Mewtwo, and waits at Mt. Silver for a true champion to challenge his power. Arceus creates Victini to stop Red if he gets too powerful. But Gold wins, and Victini goes away. The ages pass, and the world is ending. Arceus, in the last moments, creates an egg of itself, and Celebi, who takes the egg back to the beginning of the universe to begin the cycle again. Then, it goes to the future, which it stays in; this explains how we can have multiple Celebis, and/or shiny Celebis.

EP049: ""Farfetch'd, a Wild Duck Pokémon. Farfetch'd makes a delicious meal, especially when cooked with leek. Because of this, Farfetch'd is nearly extinct. ""



Yellow: ""Lives where reedy plants grow. They are rarely seen, so it's thought their numbers are decreasing. ""



Red/Blue: ""The sprig of green onions it holds is its weapon. It is used much like a metal sword. ""



BW/B2W2: ""It can't live without the stalk it holds. That's why it defends the stalk from attackers with its life""




Although it is generally accepted that the anime is not cannon, I argue in this case, the anime and in-game descriptions actually complement each other. They also paint a dark picture of the historical Farfetch'd-human interaction.


My theory is this: Farfetch'd is one of the first pokemon that was hunted for human consumption.  It's quite obviously stated in EP049 that they we hunted until near extinction, which is reinforced in the Yellow pokedex entry.  The Yellow pokedex entry even goes as far as to describe where these delicious creatures can be found.  Now, commenting on the human side, most hunters will hunt for 2 reasons: 1) for practical purposes - putting food on the table, and 2) the thrill of the hunt, or ""hunting for game"".  Farfetch'd is appealing to both of these reasons to hunt because 1) it comes with a leek, which is an added bonus because you can use it when cooking, eliminating the need to go shopping for this delicious ingredient. And 2) as stated in the Red/Blue pokedex entry, Farfetch'd will use its leek as a weapon - which is appealing to people looking for a challenge who hunt for thrills.  The BW/B2W2 pokedex entries ARE NOT meant to imply that Farfetch'd will die without its stalk (the analogy being ""charmander will die when its flame goes out""), but rather, hints at the implications should a Farfetch'd lose it.  This, being, without a stalk to defend itself, will render that Farfetch'd more vulnerable when being hunted, as it no longer has any means to protect itself from hunters.



Also, I think Mr. Mime and Jynx are lovechilds of a human who did the dirty with a ditto.

Blue comes along home as well and in the spite of the moment tells Red what he did to his Rattatta. Red realizes he is excessively strong and goes on top of mt.silver so he cannot cause anyone else's pokemon harm. He dissapears for at least the duration of Gold and Silver.

**May 13, 2035**: Northern Japan is split off from its Southern half, as a nation-wide quarantine is enacted. Anarchy soon spreads through the infection regions. 15% of humans exposed to the disease are immune, no side effect. 84.9% are affected fatally by the disease, which causes cancerous-growths. .1% of those exposed are shown to successfully mutate. The “virus” is found to be a spreadable corruption of genetic material, which causes rapid mutation in infected individuals. All large animal life above ground is soon infected.

**January 1, 2040**: 98% of all animals in Japan are wiped out, ecosystems ruled entirely by infected individuals.

**May 8, 2048**: Japanese Defense Force engages infected individuals to preserve quarantine. Coordinated attacks by infected humans and animals are seen. High levels of intelligence confirmed.

**May 10, 2048**: They fail, and the nation of Japan ceases to exist.

**October 13, 2048**: The United States Carrier George W. Bush is attacked and sunk by an unknown force. Later revealed to be a coordinated assault by the infected. Use of atomic weapons to destroy all life on Japan considered, but denied.

**February 12, 2052**: Remaining inhabitants of Japan have appeared, by outward observers, to begin adopting the infected into their religions. Part of this religion is a total weapons bad, and the banning of violence against infected individuals. This is surprisingly effective at ceasing conflict with infected individuals.

**April 2, 2055**: Infected seen to have spread to North America. Military preparedness results in a far more contained infection. Hundreds of thousands in the United States, Canada, and Mexico die.

**March 11, 2061**: The United States Army begins experimenting with the combat prowess of infected animals, which are shown to have a friendly connection to humans who treat them well, much like dogs. Initial tests exceed expectations. Later that same year, China, Russia, Vietnam, and N. Korea react by signing the Kommu Pact, ensuring protection against the now utterly overpowered West.

**July 2, 2063**: The Kommu alliance declares war on the United States. Infected used to great effect.

**November 9, 2066**: War end. Communist states dissolved, China and Russia (and all of Asia) are now loosely under the jurisdiction of the NATO.  Most governments in the area of Japan, and other badly hit nations are rebuilt into tightly interlocked city-states ruled over by a military leader, unified by regional cultures.  Pro-infected propaganda is heavily encouraged to maintain truce and discourage infected abuse.

**December 25, 2072**: The regions, now divided, that were once Japan begin to open up to the outside world. Mostly through scientific trade off.

**May 4, 2076**: Interregional wars in the former regions of Japan start over cultural differences

**August 10, 2078**: The interregional wars reach a head with the destruction of the island city of Cinnabar via a large scale, hyper-destructive infected attack and the chemical warfare used in the Kanto region poisoning and further mutating many of the indigenous infected breeds. Interregional wars erode at the peace between infected and human populations in the area, leading to larger hostile infected rates in outside population dense townships.  Hostile trends prompt United States intervention.

**August 28, 2078**: Kanto unifies under the leadership of Vermillion Grand Leader Giovanni and counter-attacks the United States forces led by Lieutenant Surge.  United States-NATO forces have greater military training and military supplies, including better field medicines and the newly created infection containment devices.

**September 30, 2078**: Vermillion is captured by United States forces, political families are dispersed through the region as townships fall to reduce potential political regrouping.  Grand Leader Giovanni is held as a political prisoner.

**January 1, 2079**: Kanto is the last Japan region to fall into line with the United States-NATO forces, large death tolls are reported in the area.

**January 10, 2079**: Japanese reforms are instated, codifying township government systems, but leave the towns and their leaderships mostly intact.

**February 6, 2079**: Creation of the Elite League, composed of the four most celebrated military leaders, two appointed by the United States and two selected from each region to pacify local populations.  Admittance is based on a system of meritocracy to encourage reunification of local hostile infected.  Relief aid is supplied to regions and households based on cooperation with Reunification Efforts, any able-bodied individual over the age of 10 may participate.

**June 15, 2079**: Giovanni is reinstated as a local township leader in return for open support of the Elite Four and the codification of the government.

**October 17, 2079**: First reports of the rebel group Team Rocket are reported including the acquired manifesto which claims to be building an army to overthrow the new system.

**February 1, 2081**: Japanese scientists sneak into heavily infected Brazil. They recover the DNA of one of the individuals believed to be one of the first infected.

Beliefs are that the infected are actually the next phase in evolution, and to find one of the originals would better help the understanding. There are many tried and failed cloning attempts, before a final experiment is successful. The result of this experiment, capable of self-induced Energy-Matter transference, is responsible for the deaths of dozens before escaping.

**May 22, 2081**: Ash Ketchum turns 10 years old.

**United Regions of Japan**


---


**Technological Information:**

-Technology is as diverse and inconsistent at the current time due to the continued recovery of areas and their relative level of participation in the Japanese-United States war.  Some townships were cooperative and relatively prospered, others resisted particularly fiercely and were not granted the same degree of technological advancements.  Yet others are just out of the way and don’t get as much attention, or nearly none at all, and are left in their states similar to how they were before the United States occupation.

-Travel is reduced due to the nearly universal removal of overland transportation technology.  The removal was partially due to the societal collapse of Japan and also encouraged to reduce environmental damage, something that has been shown to increase infected hostilities.

-Infection Containment Devices (ICDs) were distributed in the Japanese regions post-war.  The specific technologies used are governmental secrets of the United States, but work on the principal of digitally deconstructing the molecular structures of the infected individuals and reconstructing them later on command.  The ICDs were made specifically to work with the infected individual’s mutated Virus genes to prevent human capture or abuse.  While in the digital stasis, computerized alterations can be performed, such as teaching skills and location transfers at proper governmentally monitored stations.  While the construction is strictly monitored by the government, homebrews have been concocted and distributed in some areas.


**Cultural Information:**

-Japan is still steeped in the myths and legends created during the time of initial rebuilding, including the reverence of certain infected individuals, some of which are raised to deistic levels.  Such lore is encouraged to facilitate the rebuilding of the region’s cultural identity.

-Japan has a fluid and varied language regarding infected and technology related to such individuals developed during the generation after the collapse of formal society.  They continue their tradition of alternative labels as an aspect of their cultural identity.

So, Mew is known as having the DNA of all Pokemon.  Ditto is usually regarded as failed clones of Mew.  But that never seemed right to me.  Why would all these failed clones of Mew be scattered in the wild?  It's not like the Rocket Scientists would just release the failures.  Here's my theory:  If Mew is the 1st, Ditto is the 2nd.  Mew produced the Dittos, and each would transform based on whatever it saw, whether it be a bull, or a bird, or a fish, and if the form seemed strong enough, the transformation became semi-permanent.  There is a possibility that further changes will take place later in life, as what we now know as ""evolution.""  It explains why Ditto is able to breed with every non-legendary species, why so many species are able to breed outside of their own species (egg groups), and why we keep finding new species, many based off of inanimate objects.  Basically, Ditto is the ""primordial ooze"" of Pokemon.  It sees a bird, and transforms into a proto-Pidgey.  It sees a rock, and transforms into a proto-Geodude.  Eventually, these transformations take on a character of their own (Dwebble: a hermit crab, but with a rock for a shell) and standardize; this is the birth of a new species.
**TL;DR: All non-legendary Pokemon were originally Ditto.**

EDIT: Fossil Pokemon are still Ditto; Mew's been at this a while.  As for the reason they're all rock type, think of proto-Pokemon as (forgive me, but this is the best way I can say it) ""metaphysically semi-permeable.""  For instance, the proto-Charmander did not just copy a lizard, but also took in the idea of fire.  And the proto-Aerodactyl (which was not originally rock type) took in the idea that, for X number of millenia, it was a rock, and became Rock/Flying.  Same with the others.",Ditto,False,,t5_2tpgv,1356706848.0,reserved3,,True,t3_15k0u5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15k0u5/an_alternate_newer_ditto_theory/,
1342468574.0,243,self.pokemonconspiracies,wnsaa,Why Mewtwo was the only surviving clone.,280,37,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wnsaa/why_mewtwo_was_the_only_surviving_clone/,"So this week I'm having a Pokemon marathon of the first 4 movies. Today was #3, Mewtwo Returns.

The scientist who created Mewtwo- Doctor Fuji- did so upon the request of Giovanni. Fuji's research on cloning was not completely perfected. All of his previous clones failed, and Mewtwo was the only one to survive the cloning process.

If you watch the Special Features on Mewtwo Returns, there is an uncut story of Mewtwo's origin. This depicts Mewtwo's cloning process, as well as bits of Fuji's life. Now, Fuji had a family. He had a wife and a ~6 year old daughter. His daughter died in a car accident. Fuji used his research on cloning to try and clone his daughter, who's name was Amber. His attempts to clone Amber became an obsession. He spent days and nights in his basement monitering the progress. He became so obsessed that his wife eventually left him. He was alone. No daughter, no wife. His whole family, gone.

So when Giovanni gave him an offer to clone Mew, he accepted. Not for Giovanni, but for Amber. Practice to clone from a fossil -Something dead- in order to bring it back to life would give him the knowledge to clone his daughter from her dead body.

At the time of Mewtwo's cloning, there were five clones total in progress. There was BulbasaurTwo, CharmanderTwo, SquirtleTwo, MewTwo, and... AmberTwo. Another attempt to clone his daughter. These five clones, in their early stages, could communicate with eachother supposedly via telepathy. They eventually grew close and became good friends. During his cloning, Mewtwo had friends and behaved like a normal young boy.

However, for unknown reasons, the cloning of the other four all failed. They faded away in Mewtwo's subconcious, and as AmberTwo faded, *Mewtwo cried*. AmberTwo said to Mewtwo that her father used to tell her a bedtime story that, when a Pokemon cries, its tears are full of life. This legend is proven at the end of the first movie, when all of the Pokemon revive Ash with their tears. Pokemon tears are, in fact, full of life.

This is why Mewtwo is the only succesful clone. Because he cried. AmberTwo's death caused him to cry. His tears were full of life, and therefore ""revived"" him. Or, rather, the fossil he was cloned from. Mewtwo's own tears brought him to life.

The other clones didn't cry. Mewtwo's tears essentially brought him to life. Mewtwo then killed Fuji (As far as we know), and he will never see his wife or daughter again.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1344744704.0,,,True,t3_wnsaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wnsaa/why_mewtwo_was_the_only_surviving_clone/,
1371782662.0,240,self.pokemonconspiracies,1grrcc,Lavender Town Syndrome Explained,293,53,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1grrcc/lavender_town_syndrome_explained/,"Hi, guys... I know there are thousands of Lavender Town threads, but I hope this is different. I have been interested in LTS for about a year because it is the thing that introduced me to Pokemon. I'm planning on doing an experiment to test the validity of Lavender Town. First, let me say what I know IS NOT real:

-Kids did not commit suicide.

-There are no binaural beats.

-It is not caused by high frequencies... LTS is actually caused by the notes in the bass.

-There are no ""missing frequencies.""

-There is no legitimate beta version.

-It is not a cover-up... The existence of LTS is accidental.

So that being said, let me explain how I came to these conclusions. So, after days of searching, I could not find records of Nintendo or GameFreak releasing a beta, and all of the ""leaks"" only surfaced after the legend was created. To compensate for this, I decided I would only analyze a legitimate Japanese red/green song and a legitimate international remake red/blue version. Here is a screen cap of the American release: http://i.imgur.com/ThuwreN.png

Nothing too significant here. It looks pretty normal. Here is the Japanese version of the song: http://i.imgur.com/EMzLReh.png

This is at the same size, but it still does not tell us much. The sound wave is more formal and repetitive, but it doesn't give any valuable information. This is a close-up of the Japanese version: http://i.imgur.com/I3oZFjX.png

Each spike is a beep. This is even closer: http://i.imgur.com/yTOURu0.png

This was certainly unexpected, but this is the cause of LTS. What you see here are not binaural beats but in fact are isochronic tones. They are a repetition of audible spikes and inaudible waves that repeat hundreds of times a second. This is what is responsible for Lavender Town's alleged psychoactivity. It can not be binaural beats because the GB speakers were not advanced enough to contain binaurals.

I began to isolate the tones from the rest of the noise. Here are the seven seconds of what I have done so far: https://soundcloud.com/jabremill/projectlavendr-tone1ex-1

I am going to test the isolated tones, the Japanese release, as well as the international release on subjects over an 8-hour period. I am going to also test a control group to ensure that said effects aren't caused by sensory deprivation or placebo.

I will update this thread with the results of the experiment and the whole file of the isochronic tones.

###UPDATE:

Okay... A couple users pointed out that these tones could potentially form on ANY 8-bit machine, so I did comparisons to disprove that. Here is an example of a verified isochronic tone: http://i.imgur.com/lZYPLeH.png

Now here is another 8-bit soundtrack: http://i.imgur.com/gWYfdiU.png

As you can see, it did not contain anything that looked like the soundwaves in question. Another user asked for close-ups of the international release song, so here it is: http://i.imgur.com/4rdTAGs.png

It looks like it doesn't have isochronic tones, but I am still keeping the possibility when I do testing. Here are the raw songs that I analyzed (another user asked me for them): https://soundcloud.com/jabremill/pokemon-blue-red-lavender

I'm a Biology major student and I feel that the whole world of Pokemon is a little vague. The mysteries of Pokeballs and the wonders of nurse Joy. But the biggest mystery was of the Pokemon themselves, so here are my theories. I've been toying with the idea of whether or not I should do evolutions such as Ivysaur and Venasaur. I have decided against it for the time being, as they are very similar to Bulbasaur, perhaps I shall add them later on with ""exclusive features"". Anyway; here's Charmander!

**Reproduction:** Charmander has a very strange way of reproducing. Clearly there are no external reproductive organs, at least not the kind we are used to seeing. Charmander actually reproduces using the flame on its tail. Males actually carry gametes attached directly to the tip of their tail. And females carry similar eggs attached to the tip of their tail. Upon experiencing extreme heat at the tip of the tail (such as another flame); the female releases a special hormone that causes the gametes on male tails to fall. The male gametes may land on the female's eggs and in doing so, fertilize the egg. The egg continues to grow until it is too big to carry, at this point it is dropped off the tail and the egg is ready.

**Other Species Breeding:**

* Male - It is difficult for a male Charmander to breed among other species, as the gametes on its tail must fall off and land on the other specie's egg. Charmander rarely breed without the help of a synthetic hormone that causes the gametes to fall off. Yes, you heard right, the daycare is truly a conspiracy.
* Female - A female Charmander merely requires the sperm of another male species to land on her tail to initiate pregnancy.

**Growth:** Charmander is born with tiny arms and legs creating a serpent-like appearance, however, the flame on its tail is everpresent. The arms and legs quickly grow, and within a few weeks Charmander is around the average height of 0.6m and 8.5kg, at this point Charmander can be considered level 1.

**Nutrition:** Charmander is an omnivore, eating both plants, but preferring meat. During pregnancy, it has been noted that female Charmander may actually ""eat"" flames in order to keep it's flame at a comfortable temperature for the egg.

**Natural Moveset:** As a Charmander gains levels it learns new moves:

* Scratch/growl: Are the only moves known but a young Charmander as it has not yet mastered the use of it's flames.
* Ember: Charmander is able to draw some of the flames off his tail into a holding organ, not unlike the stomach, called a ""Flame Sac"". Charmander may bring forth this fire in short bursts in the attack known as ember.
* Smokescreen: Charmander allows the flames in his Flame Sac to smolder. By doing so, Charmander is able to release smoke from his mouth and nose, creating a smokescreen effect.
* Dragon Rage: Charmander is able to heat up flames to a high temperature in his Flame Sac. The intense heat increases the power of his ember, however, Charmander has little control of the temperature, and the flame begins to eat itself up after an amount of time. Inflicting a certain amount of damage and putting out any possible flames.
* Scary Face: As Charmander becomes more mature, he becomes more intimidating. Using his intimidation, Charmander is able to scare his opponents, ""lowering their speed"".
* Fire Fang: Charmander has gained more control over his fire and may now; coat the inside of his mouth (and in particular his teeth) with flames, enabling him to bite his opponents.
* Flame Burst: Charmander is able to shoot a fireball out of his mouth. Upon contact this fireball explodes, harming any nearby targets.
* Slash: Charmander's claws have hardened to the point where he can inflict critical damage.
* Flamethrower: Charmander has finally mastered the ability to fire a continuous stream of fire, that may continue until Charmander has either run out of breath, or the fire on his everburning tail runs low.
* Fire Spin: Charmander combines the finesse of a Fire Burst with the continuity of the flamethrower. Charmander is able to breath continuous flames as well as molding them into a spinning tunnel of flame. Lighting everything nearby on fire.
* Inferno: Exactly what it sounds like. Charmander unleases an Inferno upon his opponent.

**Evolution:** After 16 levels the flame on Charmander's tail has grown big enough for him to evolve into a Charmeleon. The flame on Charmander's tail, temporarily engulfs him; burning his skin, changing it from a dull orange, into a dark red. The flames trigger heat sensitive growth genes, quickly enlarging his arms and legs, creating more pronounced claws. A crest forms on the top of his head. During this process, a Charmander may feel intense pain, this may be the cause for the potential, bad-temper of a common Charmeleon.

**Ability:**
* Blaze: As Charmander becomes weaker, he becomes more and more frustrated. Charmander is extremely loyal, and never wishes to loss a battle for his trainer. Thus, through sheer will power, a weakened Charmander is able to activate the Blaze ability and increase the size of his flame, in turn increasing his fire attacks.

* Solar Power: In intense sunlight the flame on Charmander's tail begins to grow, increasing the power of his attacks. Unfortunately, the body is unable to cope with the growth of the flame, and it quickly spreads along Charmander's body, potentially inflicting intense pain.

After beating your rival once or twice, he starts getting agitated at your ability to best him at what his very own grandfather introduced him to. When you battle your rival for what could be your third time, he is coming down the bridge into Cerulean City. What's at the end of the bridge? A Team Rocket recruiter! Ah! Now, in his party, he has a Rattata. This makes one think that he decided to join Team Rocket so that maybe he could be stronger than you! 
          Go up from routes 24 and 25 and you've reached Cerulean Cape, a popular dating area. This is where our good friend Bill resides. When you find him, he has one S.S. Anne ticket, and happens to be a Clefairy. ***After joining Team Rocket, your rival is given a mission to go on the S.S. Anne to give the captain a warning from Giovanni.*** (On the S.S. Anne, there is a man all the way to the left on the entrance floor who says he's following Team Rocket, yet there are no traces of Team Rocket on the ship... Or are there?!) To get on, he needs a ticket. Bill, living in Cerulean Cape, has two. One for him, and a significant other. When your rival arrives he turns Bill into a Pokemon and tells him not to mention anything about Team Rocket to anyone else. You find him, trapped as a Pokemon. And in thanks, he gives you a ticket to the S.S. Anne. He is trying to stop your rival without blatantly saying so. 
***I included this as a thought, there is no other proof than that stated as to why/how he entered onto the S.S. Anne.***
          He is seen leaving the Pokemon Tower next. There are conspiracies on that his Raticate died, and that YOU killed it. IF we believe in those, well... You heartless monster! In doing so, your rival doesn't feel as obligated to help Team Rocket, now that their ""gift"" of a Rattata is in the dirt. He saw what the other Rocket Grunts were doing to Mr. Fuji, and he couldn't bear it. Mr. Fuji only spoke up on the behalf of the dead Marowak they had killed, ***when it was only trying to save its baby Cubone.*** He saw how strongly Mr. Fuji felt about Pokemon, and after seeing the ghost of Cubone's mother, your rival realized something.

          You meet your rival again inside Sliph Co. Why was he there?! A few moments later, you fight Team Rocket HEAD, Giovanni. Your rival is exiting from Giovanni's room. After the death of his Raticate- after seeing all the damage done to the city of Saffron, its populous and to innocent Pokemon, your rival goes to Sliph Co. to resign from Team Rocket once and for all. He isn't that heartless to not care about his fallen teammate. He battles you to see if his theory of joining the gang to improve his skill, and of course, it does not.
          At this point he begins to wonder why he cannot beat you. He tries again and again, and eventually fails as a Pokemon champion. This is when he realizes his mistake in not trusting in himself and his Pokemon. He then dedicates his life to researching Pokemon, as such when you see him again on the Sevii Islands.

TL; DR: Your rival is a part of Team Rocket for the middle of the game. He realizes his mistake too late and fails as a trainer.

Sabrina, the Saffron City gym leader, has an exceptionally strong bond with her Pokemon, especially with her Kadabra, due to her psychic powers.

Sabrina has had psychic powers since she was a child. ""It started when a spoon I carelessly tossed, bent."" (quoted from FameChecker in FireRed/LeafGreen) In the anime, it is said she inherited her powers from her father. She turned her mother into a doll. She had become very cold and malicious and seemed to have a bond only with her Pokemon.

Her Abra, who evolved into a gym battle into Kadabra, holds such a strong bond with her that when Ash's Haunter causes Sabrina to laugh, Kadabra laughs too.

According to a [Pokedex entry about Kadabra](http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Kadabra), a boy with psychic abilities transformed into a Kadabra. Since Abra evolves into Kadabra, it is possible a boy could turn into an Abra.

Since it has been established that psychic powers can be genetic, I believe Sabrina had a little brother who transformed into an Abra (or Kadabra, as I don't believe all of the manga shows her having an Abra) and that is why they are so strongly connected. It is also why she is so cold to her father, the mysterious man who assists Ash in the anime, because she blames him for her brother's transformation and imprisons her mother just as her brother is imprisoned in the form of Kadabra so her father can share in her pain.

When Haunter makes her laugh, it reminds her of her childhood and the good times she and her brother once shared, helping her through her grief and allowing her family to be reunited, even though her brother is still a Pokemon.

**tl;dr** Sabrina's Kadabra is really her brother who turned into a Kadabra through his psychic abilities.

When the bubbles pop, they actually explode and spread blasts of concentrated moist air at the target.

__________________

THIS HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH TIER

* Ash's age

This is mostly because the conversation devolves into anime vs. game continuity.

* Red is Blue/Oak's/Giovanni's sister's uncle's brother's former room mate.

There's never enough evidence to have a meaningful discussion.

* What's under a Diglett?

In which everyone posts their deviantart Diglett.

* All established premises, eg. killing Raticate, Cubone and Kangaskhan, Ditto is a Mew, Lavender Town, Voltorb is a Pokeball.

* Pokemon are data all data are Pokemon something about Pokemon and virtual reality.

Yes, we *get* that it's a videogame.

____________________

THIS CAN BE REFRESHING TIER

* Pokemon Wars

If your theory is detailed enough, it can be interesting and novel. People love to nitpick.

* Pokemon Timelines

Again, people love to comb through timelines and point out inconsistencies. Often interesting if all potential plotholes are thought of and it ties into the games well.

* Alternate Pokemon / 4chan Copypasta

Stories that explain the Pokemon universe's background or could-have-been, usually through 4chan greentext or image macro. Creepypasta is **not** well received, though.

_______________________________

WE LOVE TO CIRCLEJERK TIER

* Pokemon similarities

Especially if they are across generations, people love to see similarities and ""hidden evolutions"" between seemingly unrelated pokemon.

* Who's the real pokemon god?

I cannot believe how many posts there have been about Arceus and Mew.

___________________________ 

On the other hand, there are rarely posts about core gameplay mechanics and generations III-V.

Does this sound about right to everyone? We'll start looking at tiers 1 and 2 a lot more carefully to keep stale content off the front page.

**Speaking of which** the mod queue has been acting up (caught 7 posts this evening) so message us if you don't appear.

I'll make this a sticky once we agree on what's been overdone or not.

It's called Old Lady's Rest Stop. A place where weary trainers can ""Come in and rest your tired bones"". When you talk to the old lady she says you and your Pokemon look tired and should rest, but the way she says it seems odd. After you wake up she asks if your Pokemon are still tired and suggests you take another rest. It seems strange that she is encouraging you to continue sleeping, even though you and your party is all refreshed. I believe there is a simple explanation for what is really going on. The old lady is really a Gastly in disguise. 

In the Anime episode *Ghost of Maiden's Peak* we saw that a Gastly take the form of the Maiden's ghost. So a Gastly may have simply taken the form of an old lady. It's also a possibility that Gastly simply possessed the old woman and is using her as a puppet, similar to what happened to Blue in the Manga. But what is Gastly's motivation. It's simple, he eats the dreams. Gastly learns dream eater through leveling up, something only a handful of Pokemon were able to do in Gen III, and eats dreams as a source of sustenance. 

So in short, the old lady in the rest house on Route 111 is really a Gastly in disguise and eats your dreams.

You're family-friends with a world renowned prof, that must mean you run in some pretty tight circles.

2.

Other people in the game need real jobs and just have Pokemon as a hobby more so than anything (sailors have water Pokemon, kids have bugs etc).

3. The town you start off in is a suburb, which is richer than the crowded and congested cities.

4. **Most Glaring of All!** I saved the best for last. Starters are super luxuries, only afforded to the most well-off kids. Think about it, all other kid trainers you encounter have Rattatas or Pidgeys or Caterpies that they probably had to catch themselves. You are given a sweet elemental Poke (incredibly rare and valuable) that becomes much more powerful at the end. Why else are they called ""starters"" yet very few other kids in the game have them? I remember one guy having a Wartortle on the path to Vermillion, he must come from a rich family too. If they were true ""starters"", then everyone would have one. The truth is they're only ""starters"" for rich kids whose families have the ability to start them on that path. Other kids have to make do with weak Pokemon they catch themselves. It's just like in high school, where normal kids had to work to buy their used Ford Escorts whereas the rich kid was given a Porsche for his birthday.

That's easily some of the most powerful dialogue in any Pokémon game. Despite dropping the key, he makes no attempt to get it back; he instead waits there, incessantly reminding you of the fact that you're able to take it for yourself.

He never wanted to keep you from getting further into the base. Growing disillusioned of Team Rocket, but knowing that he would never be able to safely leave, he saw you as his chance. You were storming through the base, taking down any grunt in your way. If you defeated Giovanni, perhaps he would disband Team Rocket, and the grunt would be free. But you wouldn't be able to do that without access to Giovanni's room, and you would need the lift key for that. The grunt was lucky enough to have been entrusted with the key, and took the opportunity to make sure that the key ended up in your possession.

You might have lost, of course. And if Giovanni discovered that you were in possession of the key, the grunt would be punished even more than he would have if he'd tried to leave. But the grunt was willing to bet in your favor.

That would require a low happiness evolution. And GameFreak makes the games to encourage friendship and the such. So why would they go against that message by putting in a Pokemon that requires abuse to get?

Over the generations the colours seem to have gone into higher ""values"" first just red and blue, then gold and silver, eventually into valuable stones like Ruby/Saphire/Emerald and then Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, constantly increasing in ""value"", but the 5th generation gave us two basic colours, Black and White. However, these colours are not so basic, and the games reflect that in many ways.

First and probably the most prevailant in these games is Ideology. Evil orginizations in the past have always just been out for their own selfish goals. Rocket wanted money and power, Magma and Aqua wanted supremacy, and Galactic wanted conquest. However, for the first time, Plasma fought for something they believed in, equality and freedom of pokemon. Now yes, the argument can be made that this was a ruse by Ghestis for his own means, but no one knew this BUT him, everyone joined and followed Ghestis because they believed in what he said. It brings to light (at least in the games) the actual cruelty of trapping animals and releasing them to fight each other. Now pokemon is a different universe, and in they show that trainers and their pokemon grow friendship and strength through battles, but there are always bad trainers who abuse their pokemon or activly seek to harm others (such as the other eveil Teams). Team Plasma is the only organization that provides a valid argument to justify their actions, which brings me back to my point: not everything is black and white. Their are 2 sides to every argument and although some people really stick to one side, it is not neccesarily the right one, and maybe neither side is truely ""correct."" Your trainer in the game sticks to one side and continues to fight for what they think is the right side, just as Team Plasma does.

Now, normally in a generation we see a second release that just expands on the world a little bit: Yellow/Crystal/Emerald/Platinum. It is more or less the same game with some expanded content. This time, however, we got 2 games that were direct sequals to Black and White. Many of us expected a Grey version, but instead we got two new storylines that expand on what happened in the first games. Why not a Grey version? My theory is that we never got a real answer to ""is battling pokemon humane?"" out of the first game, and they need to expand more on the question. N left at the end of Black/White to seek his own answers, and despite being able to talk to pokemon AND the evils that Ghestis displayed, he still has no answer. In B/W2 there are even two team Plasmas: those who reformed and those who push more for domination and forced release of pokemon. Even their outfits match the game colours, one is prodominatly black while the other is mostly white, both have grey on them to represent they ""grey area"" of the argument IE you don't know if it is wrong or right. 

Gamefreak needed a whole sequal to refrase their question, as opposed to just asking the same question again. Perhaps there will be a ""pokemon Grey Version"" next that will bring this question to a close, but I doubt it.

This is the pokedex entry for Arceus in Platinum and Black and White. Arceus created the universe, time and space, and supposedly the first pokemon. But where did the egg come from?

Celebi is known to travel through time and leave eggs from the past in the future, and from the future in the past. So it is possible that the egg was left by celebi, who hadn't existed at that point in history (or technically prehistory) but was able to travel back in time to that point and leave the egg.

Its like The Flash (one of them anyway) from the DC Universe who was struck by lightning, giving him access to the speed force, but it was later shown that future flash was traveling so fast that he went back in time and ended up being the lightning bolt that struck him giving him his powers, stemming from the idea that the course of events in the universe are finite and cannot be changed, the past and present are merely illusions, because what is meant to be will come to be regardless of circumstances. 

Celebi exists because Arceus created him and the other legendaries (non legendaries are descended from Mew). Because Celebi was created by Arceus he was able to take the Arceus egg back in time to the origin of existence. But who created that egg? Arceus created it, as he had always planned.

So lets look at it this way. Arceus creates all of the legendaries and the egg from which he would sprout, being all powerful. After the creation Celebi takes the egg that Arceus created and takes it back before time began flowing, and space existed. Just as the flash gave himself his powers, Arceus too brought himself into existence.

Pokemon created by a kind of sentient fungi taking over the decaying body of a Krabby.

Hm.. sentient fungi... What Pokemon is a fungi?

Foongus.

Now look at Krabby and Paras;

Both of them have:

1. Two large front claws
2. Orange shell/exoskeleton 
3. Four legs
4. Yellow shiny form (Gen II)

So for Paras to be created, a Foongus must find a decaying Krabby, and feed upon its remains. 

Then, a sort of evolution will occur, similar to when a Cloyster bites the tail of a Slowpoke, transforming it into Slobro.

Foongus gets a bit of an appearance change, like Cloyster, into the two Mushrooms on the back of Paras. 

But the Paras has a life of its own now, and Foongus has limited control of its host. Once it evolves it will be able to regain control.

In the Pokedex entry for Parasect, its evolution, it states: 

A host-parasite pair in which the parasite mushroom has taken over the host bug. Prefers damp places. (Red and Blue)

And: 

The bug host is drained of energy by the mushrooms on its back. They appear to do all the thinking. (Yellow)

By this point, Foongus has now taken over completely...

As additional evidence towards this theory, Foongus can learn the move 'Spore'.

Pokedex entry for Parasect from Diamond:

A mushroom grown larger than the host's body controls Parasect. It scatters poisonous spores. 

Please critique this conspiracy theory, it is my first :)


***EDIT:

One awesome Redditor suggested that Nincada might fit the part of Krabby better due to body similarities. So if you prefer this, simply swap Krabby for Parasect in the theory, and ignore the shiny coloration :)

***EDIT TWO:

Someone has pointed out that a Pokedex entry says the mushrooms on the back of Paras are Tochukaso mushrooms, so....

To further expand on this theory, for the sake of the pokedex entry, we could say that Foongus is just an evolved Tochukaso mushroom that gained sentience from exposure to radiation.

Then, when Foongus takes over Paras it reverts back into its origins, a Tochukaso mushroom, which sprouts on the Paras's back, and Foongus's consciousness resides inside of Paras, manipulating it, while the fungi is it's true form.",high quality,False,,t5_2tpgv,1352252321.0,quality,,True,t3_12r4fu,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12r4fu/paras_is_actually_a/,

1341708002.0,165,self.pokemonconspiracies,w794f,Missingno.'s origins,193,28,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/w794f/missingnos_origins/,"Missingno. is one of the most bizzare, downright disturbing parts of the original game. But where did it come from, and what the fuck IS it?

It's well known that Cinnabar Island (the place where Missingno. can be encountered) contains a burnt-out lab, where, presumably, experiments used to take place. We don't really know what happened there, but there seems to be a link with Mew; in Mewtwo's pokedex entry, it says that Mewtwo was 'created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments.' 
Given that this took years of 'horrific' experiments, there were bound to be a few mishaps, weren't there? 

Enter Missingno.

During a particularly catastrophic attempt to create Mewtwo/clone Mew, the scientist in question created a malformed, half-existent, shape-shifting mess of DNA (perhaps its ability to appear in several different forms- such as a skeleton Kabuto or Ghost- could be explained by the fact that it has a primitive ability to transform; a skill which Mew is able to carry out flawlessly and thus the scientist attempted to copy), and Missingno. was born. Horrified by the monstrosity he had created, and desperate to keep it a secret, the scientist removed Missingno. and drove it out into the sea. The confused monstrosity of a creature, with nowhere to go, simply lurks around Cinnabar Island, with no incentive to leave, and with little understanding of its surroundings.

The scientist, on successfully creating Mewtwo, then attempted to cover his tracks by forging diary entries which seem to catalogue the events leading up to Mewtwo's supposed 'birth' by Mew; these events never happened- Mew has no gender or indeed partner and so could never reproduce, and the diary entries are merely lies, invented for the purpose of covering up the true nature of Mewtwo's creation, and the deformed failures (most notably Missingno.) that were created in the process.

Missingno. does share some similarities with Mew/Mewtwo: it does not appear to the ordinary bystander, usually remaining hidden, and is actually very powerful- Missingno. has a level exceeding 100.
The moves which it has learned can be explained by its surroundings- Missingno., something of an outcast, which has not been taught or conditioned in any way, has learned moves by observing. As people constantly fly to and from Cinnabar (something of a landmark, given that it contains a high-ranking gym and laboratory), Missingno. imitates the flying pokemon, and thus knows Sky Attack. As it seems to float around the shore of Cinnabar, it has obviously been exposed to many water-type pokemon, and, through mimicry, has learned Water Gun.

Missingno. also seems to have an ability to distort its surroundings- when caught, and sent to the PC, Missingno. alters the Hall of Fame, turning it into a confused mess. Moreover, the Pokemon Mansion where Missingno. was created is full of Mew statues- perhaps Missingno. has transformed objects into these in its ongoing attempts to mimic Mew. 

And what of the scientist himself?

The fact that Missingno. sometimes appears as a Kabutops skeleton, and other times as an Aerodactyl skeleton, are perhaps an indicator as to who the scientist was. During his project to create Mewtwo, the scientist worked on other things simultaneously and had other instruments with him; interested in fossils, he had many lying around while conducting his work. When created, Missingno. noticed and attempted to copy some of the things that it saw besides Mew- having noticed the skeletons, Missingno. occasionally attempts to morph (more successfully) into copies of these.

Once successful in creating Mewtwo, the scientist realised he could not control it, and would be held responsible for any damage it caused. Eager to become incognito and cover up the work that he had done, the scientist turned his attention to another project of his- the reanimation of fossils.
Yes, the quirky doctor who revives your Dome/Helix Fossil or Old Amber is in fact the creator of Missingno.
As previously mentioned, Missingo. has the ability to (whether or not it is intentional seems unclear) distort its surroundings- and the scientist did not escape unscathed. Although he seems physically fine, his brain was damaged during his exposure to Missingno.- thus he is unable to speak properly and struggles to string sentences in English together- his memory has been warped, and his powers of communication are somewhat diminished.

Missingno. continues to warp and distort its surroundings- the player can also encounter other stupidly overpowered pokemon (such as Level 134 Golducks or Hypnos- the latter of which cannot even survive in such conditions) around the area in which Missingno. lurks when performing the glitch that causes it to appear. Indeed, when the player attempts to enter Cinnabar Gym but does not have the key, the sprite for an old man can sometimes be momentarily seen on the roof of the building- this is another example of Missingno. causing glitches in its surroundings. Once the player has caught Missingno., the player's own sprite and those of their pokemon begin to warp and become scrambled- due to their constant exposure to Missingno.'s presence. 

Could Missingno. have subsequently created other glitch pokemon in the game? Or were they other failed experiments, which the scientist took great pains to remove from the island?

tl;dr - Missingno. is a failed Mewtwo, created by the fossil reviving scientist, which can warp its surroundings due to its attempt to emulate Mew's ability to transform.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1341760812.0,,,True,t3_w794f,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/w794f/missingnos_origins/,

Seriously though, I think there is a reason they are so expensive and I believe that has to do with currency exchange. We normally see a  Pokémon Dollar and think of it as $1, while in fact it has a exchange rate closer to that of the yen, explaining why simple items cost hundreds of dollars and why it seems like Pokemon trainers (even kids) carry huge sums of money on them.

The current American Dollar ( 0.0127798) to Japanese Yen (78.2487 ) exchange would make 1,000,000 bike be around 12,795.0869 American Dollars.

This still might seem like a lot, but IRL a professional level bike (for time trials) can cost anywhere between $8,000- $15,000. For a Match bike (as an example) this could be a very reasonable comparison. In the anime Misty said she paid 10,000 for her bike (around $127.9149) so that means people (especially kids) can still get bikes cheap if they need to (but be sure to expect lower quality, as hers couldn't stand up to a single low level Pokemon attack).

If it still seems a little overpriced to you, think about it like this. People mostly use Pokemon as a means of transportation over long distances, and towns are so small that people wouldn't necessarily need a bike to commute. This leaves only hobbyists, athletic trainers, or the rare non pokemon user traveler. Shop owners can mark up prices a bit since they are the only ones in their region, plus it offsets the cost of running the shop and materials/man power to create the bike.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_x2gml,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/x2gml/why_bikes_are_so_expensive/,

Just Pokemon. Every person you meet, and everywhere you go, it's always just about Pokemon. The Old man in the corner of town really likes to buy Pokemon food for his Raticate, and the woman in the store is there to buy potions for her Feebas. Everything in this world is revolving around the concept of pokemon. The economy, tourism, culture, even crime. But the answer may be very simple.


Think about this. When you were a kid, did you really care about what the grown ups talked about? If you were out playing, you didn't stop to hear your father talk about his bankloans? No, you did your kid things all day, came home for dinner, and then continued. But if one of your parents would mention the word ""video game"" or ""bucket full of candy"" you'd be all over it. And that would often be the subjects grown ups would use to connect with you. Cause that is what works. Much better than talking to a kid about the family situation or money problems. 

So if a stranger now sees a little kid running around, wanting to be a pokemon master, it would humorously talk about pokemon to it. Sometimes it would be ""Ooh, you have a pokemon? I have a pokemon too!"", or sometimes ""You should hit the store, little kid, you don't want your pokemon to starve"" in fear of you being irresponsible. Because you really are. You catch everything you see, and you leave those critters in your pc to rot. Every place you go, the world is formed after your interrests. From what you want to see. And people talk to you about what connects with a ten-year old best. And that's Pokemans in this case.

Editional thoughts: Another points indicating to how the world is being shaped through the players eyes is the lack of more serious themes that would excist in the world. No trace of politics or world issues, instead we are served simple ""good and evil"" scenarios. There are criminals and those who stop criminals. There are no sense of perspective, everything is black and white (No pun intended). But these themes excist between the lines, though. Maybe the most popular example is Lt. Surge. It is hinted that he fought in a war, maybe with pokemon. The point is that these issues are present, but too heavy to bear through a child's eyes. For a kid it's too early to accept that these serious themes are a part of the world.

How else could each person be such an amazingly important person?  Giovanni wasn't beaten by a million people at once.  Gary didn't have a million rivals.  Oak did not give out a million Squirtles.  

In truth, a million Giovannis were beaten by *one* kid.  A million Gary's had *one* rival each.  A million Oaks gave out *one* Squirtle to *one* kid.

There are often times when a trainer and their pokemon are alone together, and at those times Litwick's flame is still lit, which means it is still draining life force from somewhere. The only source would be the trainer. Furthermore, in w2, there is a girl in celestial tower who you battle, and all she has is 1 litwick. After you beat her, she says that the battle took a lot out of her, and that she feels very drained. Obviously, her lit wick is absorbing her life force, and you may have just saved her life by incapacitating it. Or you've doomed her, because the lit wick will be weakened and need more energy, and will thus drain her life force even faster. In addition, the pokedex states that Lampent takes the spirits of dead people and absorbs their spirits for energy. It is possible that Litwick evolves into Lampent when it absorbs its first dead spirit. How does it evolve in-game? By leveling up. I theorize that the pokemon litwick makes faint just before evolution actually dies, and its death gives litwick energy to evolve. By this logic, it would also be possible for a litwick to evolve after killing its trainer, but there is no evidence of this having ever happened. The pokedex also says that Chandelure, the final evolution of litwick and lampent, consumes spirits as well, and that those spirits fuel its flames. Now, lament evolves with a dusk stone, so it most likely does not need to kill to evolve (although it certainly does kill sometimes), but does anyone know what's in a dusk stone? Perhaps spirits are trapped inside, put there by magic (which has been seen to exist in the pokemon world), or by a move similar to block or mean look, and that is how it can power the evolution of a lampent or other ghost-types.
edit: parashuvincent made an excellent point. When litwick ""kills"" a trainer, it's a very slow process, and one that would not cause immediate death for a young trainer. This is why there are no noticeable effects on you if you carry a litwick. It would only shave a somewhat small amount of time off the end of your life. It could noticeably kill an old trainer, but not a young one.

tl;dr 
litwick drains the life force of its trainer and evolves into lampent when it kills another pokemon, and dusk stones have dead spirits trapped inside them.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1353324992.0,,,True,t3_13ev3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/13ev3q/litwick_and_lampent_are_pokekillers/,

One of the most recognizable properties of the Phoenix, across a surprising amount of cultures, is that at the end of its life, the phoenix burns up and dies by its own fire, only to later regenerate from its own ashes and be reborn stronger and healthier.

The birth, death, and rebirth of the phoenix is a well-known metaphor in a lot of popular culture. It goes pretty well with the ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" saying (which is ironic, because the phoenix actually does die before it becomes stronger). But what does this have to do with Victory Road?

Victory Road is your penultimate challenge before the endgame, the last obstacle standing between you and the Elite Four, the toughest trainers in the game. Victory Road itself is a complex and harsh maze that includes high-leveled wild Pokemon, diverse and powerful trainers, and some rather difficult puzzles (at least the first time around). If you take the right path, you may find Moltres, and perhaps even capture it.

Coming out of Victory Road is the metaphorical rebirth of the phoenix, your player character, Red. Perhaps you even have Moltres in hand when you do. Entering Victory Road is the death of the phoenix, undergoing a challenge that could very well end your journey. Emerging from the other side, hardened by battle and stronger than you were before you entered, is the phoenix's rebirth from its own ashes. 

This is my theory as to why Moltres was in Victory Road in the first place, which is also why I'm a little bothered by the fact that the remakes moved it to a totally different and not symbolically valuable location.

I believe that voltorbs and pokeballs were invented during the ever popular (conspiracy theory) Kanto Pokemon Armageddon. 
As Bill perfected his PC box system, generals and pokemon breeding and training centers could ship mass quantities of pokemon to battle stations, ready for deployment.  Pokeballs also made it easier to heal the wounded pokemon. At some point, one of the sides came up with Voltorb and Electrode.  Genetically/ mechanically engineered to look like Pokeballs, Voltorbs could be shipped behind enemy lines.  A preliminary few Electrodes would race out of the trojan-horse-type delivery method and paralyze all humans and pokemon in the area. Then, the remaining pokemon, usually low to mid level Voltorb (more expendable than a high speed, highly trained Electrode) would use self destruct and explosion, wiping out the now helpless soldiers. 
Before this innovation, battles were slow, left to highly trained and skillfull battlers.  After the implementation of pokeballs into the war, Voltorb and Electrode warfare caused casualty rates to spike.

Due to the nature of a number of Pokedex entries a number of friends of mine have agreed with me that the speed stat actually refers to a pokemon's ability to accelerate here's why

1. Dex entry Pidgeot- It spreads its beautiful wings wide to frighten its enemies. It can fly at Mach 2 speed.

2. Dex entry Dodrio- When Doduo evolves into this odd breed, one of its heads splits into two. It runs at nearly 40 mph

3. Now lets compare the base speed stats Pidgeot's is 91 whereas Dodrio's is 100. Speed is most commonly given a unit of m/s, but lets use mph because conversions are annoying. So Dodrio has a base 100 speed and can consequently run at approximately 40 mph. This would equate each point of ""speed"" to approximately .4 mph, which is ridiculous. Because Pidgeot which can apparently fly at Mach 2 which is roughly 1600 mph has a base speed stat of 91. This does not add up, so I thought what if this refers to the acceleration instead? That's when things started to make significantly more sense, lets think of a pokemon battle. 

One trainer sends out a Pidgeot, the other sends out a Jolteon, the Jolteon uses thunderbolt, Pidgeot faints the battle is over. Assuming that both pokemon are released from their pokeballs at approximately the same time these pokemon should be considered at a stand still effectively meaning that their speed (m/s) is actually 0. So in terms of physics
v=at + V0(original velocity)

Thus the pokemon with the higher ""speed"" or acceleration stat hits first. 

Plausible? 

I've also attempted to equate the ""speed"" stat to a numeric value but I haven't been able to find a decent example to work from yet, if anyone could help shed some light on the matter I'd be extremely grateful

That's right. Everyone but the scientist in the Captain's Office are ghosts. The Theory: One night, while the luxury liner the S.S. Cactus was sailing from Slateport City to Dewford Island, a terrible storm brewed up. The Ship crashed into the rocks that lined the route, and many of the people on board died. Their ghosts haunt the ship, reliving what happened to them before the storm.

While pokemon trainers can't do much with these four pokemon, they are incredibly war resources.

- Zubat and Ratatta for **warfare**. 

Rats have historically been used as disease vectors during sieges and recently as suicide bombs. It's possible these used to be a pestilence used by an enemy which has recently been brought under control. Alternatively, these rats prospered during war, a recurring problem seen in *All's Quiet on the Western Front*, for example.

Zubat is incredibly useful because it learns supersonic and leech life very early on. Packs of bats could be used to harass and confuse enemy troops. Bright lights worked on zubats however, and in times of peace they have been driven into caves.

- Pidgey as **transportation**.

An easy to breed bird that can carry supplies to troops. Its evolutions can carry wounded human from battle as well as heavier medical supplies and weapons. Now that the war is over, programs for breeding Pidgeottos and Pidgeots has stopped, and wild Pidgeys have been left in the wild to prosper.

- Magikarp as **food**.

Everything about Magikarp is useless except when grown as a crop. (*I'm assuming you can eat Magikarp*.) The breed like crazy, they can live in inhospitable conditions, including polluted waters, and they're harmless. They would be an invaluable resource when most resources would be committed to the war effort. Just as long as they don't evolve into Gyarados!

I think there are two possible explanations for this:

1)  Since the entries are blank before catching the pokemon, the text had to come about at time of capture.  The protagonist, then, is the most likely source of this data.  Since you are essentially Ash, it makes sense that most entries seem like the ramblings of a kid hyped up on pixie sticks at 3 in the morning during his first sleepover - Ash is, after all, an idiot.  

2)  If the information isn't coming from the protagonist, it is either being analyzed by pokemon professors via wireless networking capabilities, or it is being actively analysed by the pokedex.  In either of these scenarios, I find myself asking a question:  why are scientists (and/or their creations) coming up with lines as coherent as that of a contestant on ""Kids say the darnedest things?""

Let's run with number 2, shall we? Because while the option 1 seems more plausible at first glance, further investigation makes the latter more interesting.

So couple this idea, that either professors or their machines are telling me that pain from burns from a houndoom will hurt ""forever,"" with other observational evidence around the pokeworld:

* ""We found this egg with your pokemon!  We have no idea how it got there.""  Even after seeing 8000 of them.
* The plans of every villainous team in the pokeverse - ""we're gonna take over the world using nothing but raticates and golbats"" was *by far* the most competent plan in any edition thus far.
* Parents are sending their *10 year old children* off unsupervised across the continent to battle with animals powerful enough that two starters can throw beds and armoires around with ease (source: the start of B/W).
* There are grown men who are convinced that teams of only magikarp or only geodudes are competitive.

To me, something becomes clear very quickly:  The world of pokemon is inhabited by humans whose intellectual sophistication is so far below our own that it's as if the entire world never graduated elementary school.  

This also explains how we, the players, are able to relatively easily dominate the world of pokemon - because the players are so much more intelligent it's about as much of a competition as a grown person arm-wrestling an 8-year-old.

Why?  Because by living alongside pokemon in a cooperative manner humans have never felt any evolutionary pressure to develop more intellectually than they already did.

The only piece of the puzzle that isn't rock solid is the prevalence of truly remarkable technology - pokeballs, PC storage, matter transportation (trading), palaces erupting from underground, interaction with other universes.  My best explanation is that because pokemon, especially electric and steel, exist they have allowed the scientists to experiment with electronics, materials, and construction exponentially faster than our own evolutionary predecessors, perhaps without ever bothering to learn how they work.

**TL; DR:** Everyone in the pokemon universe is, by our world's standards, an idiot because they never had to get smarter - they had pokemon to help them survive.

But we must also consider: Most Ghosts reproduce just the same as any other Pokemon. If these things were supposedly unique spirits, how could they form breeding populations? My theory is this: Ghosts are regular species of animal like most Pokemon, they are just a life form very different from most.

So now you may ask why they hang around cemeteries if they are animals and not spirits of the dead. Several Ghost Pokemon are described as feeding off of the life energy of people or other Pokemon. Cemeteries are places of grief, so a person's life energy would be weaker in their mournful state, and thus easier to steal.

This would still leave a few unexplained, such as Spiritomb, which is repeatedly stated to be composed of human spirits. To that, I would say the *original* Spiritomb was such a creation, but when this creature was made into a Pokemon species, it gained the ability to breed and create more Spiritomb, which have the same body and powers, but lack the 108 spirits bound to it.

While I've thought on the issue before, I had never come to a satisfactory conclusion. When the question came up once more, I gave it a proper thinking-through, and believe I have come to a conclusion which makes sense and satisfies me.

As I do with all my theories, I have examined the evidence in given in the games explicitly, and I deny any other continuity, such as the manga or anime. 

My first piece of evidence is that of Machop. Machop is fairly small, not even three feet tall. Despite this, they are purported to be able to lift a Graveler. While likely an exaggeration by a 10-year old child, it does put into perspective the incredible strength a Machop likely possesses.

Furthermore, Machop is described as being greatly interested in martial arts. Again, since I do not believe that the Machop line is sentient, due primarily to lack of evidence, I assume that this is an exaggeration, but it does bring up some interesting ideas. To a 10-year old, especially one which has not practiced martial arts to any real degree (as is likely for most young trainers), any fighting moves that Machop practice probably come across as martial arts-like. In fact, one could argue that perhaps the many different fighting-type moves that Machop learns resemble techniques from other pokemon-world fighting styles (who better to learn from than a pokemon concentrated around fighting?).

Next, my evidence from Machoke. Now, Machoke is enormously powerful; so powerful, in fact, that a belt must be used to contain its power. Presumably this is something that protects itself more than the rest of the populace; I imagine that if it used its full power it would likely end up killing itself. 

In any case, Machoke's pokedex entries differ from Machop's in that Machoke seems more concerned with bodybuilding and increasing its physical capabilities, rather than learning new fighting techniques (interestingly, this is almost represented by the fact that it learns moves later, meaning it gains greater amounts of stat increases between learning moves, but I digress). Even its arms possess rips, showing off the newly formed muscles, uncontrollable beneath its skin. This change between the philosophy of Machoke and Machop is something to be noted.

Finally, we have Machamp, and once again, my theory comes from the pokedex entries. Machamp has ""mastered many martial arts styles"" and ""can throw other pokemon over mountains."" Once again, hyperbole, exaggeration, &amp;c, &amp;c, but the interesting thing to note is one particular word: mastered.

While Machop and Machoke are being trained by a single trainer, they are learning new fighting techniques and styles from their trainer. Upon being traded, however, its entire basis of combat is changed. It gains a new trainer, likely gains new companions, and receives an entirely new view on life. This inextricably alters its mind and ethos, leading to the evolution into Machamp.

Note, Machop doesn't evolve, because it is in the process of learning new techniques. Any change from trading simply is assimilated into its training. Its only when the change in training occurs to the more mature, more ""set in its ways"" Machoke that the epiphany can take place.

Further, note the physical differences between Machoke and Machop. Machoke is basically just a buffed up, chisled version of Machop with a belt. But, the change from Machoke to Machamp is drastic. Machamp has four arms; Machoke has two. Machamp is nearly 300 pounds; Machoke is just over 150. Machamp has a huge torso compared to its waist; Machoke is much more proportionate. Machamp has only two toes, its feet set up to be constantly primed; Machoke is more like a human, with five toes. Machamp has no rips on its arms; Machoke has massive gaping tears on its arms, and even Machop has what appears to be stretch marks on its chest. 

In other words, from the physiological changes it can be concluded that Machamp has more fully assimilated into a fighting powerhouse. It has mastered many styles of fighting and its own body, and this is reflected in its new form. It retains the belt from Machoke because, once again, it could destroy itself by using its true power, much like how a human who uses the entire power of their muscles would crush their bones.

**In Conclusion...**
Machamp evolves via trading because it has reached a physical and mental epiphany, transcending the normal physicality that it has thus far existed within to become something honed and designed to fight. It has reached the pinnacle of its existence

**As an aside...**
This didn't really fit into my analysis as is, but I found it interesting. The Machamp family is one of three families which possesses the No Guard ability, and the only family to gain it not as a hidden ability (the others are Golurk and Karrablast). This is interesting because No Guard makes it so that neither the opponent or the user can benefit from moves such as Protect or Deflect. In other words, Machop and co. know exactly how to get around any defense, befitting them as the masterful fighting pokemon.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_15ehyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15ehyg/why_machamp_evolves_via_trade/,
1341365610.0,147,self.pokemonconspiracies,w0cy6,"The Volcarona Legend (an extensive conspiracy theory, developed into a story)",163,16,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/w0cy6/the_volcarona_legend_an_extensive_conspiracy/,"Once upon a time, a young man from Cinnabar Island trudged cold and lonely through the snow on a high mountain path in the dead of night. He had been hiking for a while, and realised that he was completely lost up in the snowy mountains. Little did he know that his life was about to change.

Suddenly he saw a bright light flicker and rise up over a mountain some distance away. It surprised him, and he wondered what it could be. It seemed to be moving up and down and slowly growing brighter. As it got closer, it started to look to him like some kind of great flying beast. He began to get excited - he himself was a passionate researcher of Pokemon and a scholar, so he wondered if this could be an undiscovered Pokemon species. And as it came into clear view, it mesmerised him.

It was an enormous bird of more than describable size and beauty. Its wings glistened and blazed with embers, and its crest shone with crimson fire. The man was spellbound by its beauty.

Then, suddenly, the bird swooped over his head, and proceeded to glide down the mountain. The young man watched as embers scattered from its wings... and he noticed that they all fell in a particular way. 

When they finally all landed, the man realised that they laid out a path; the path back down the mountain! He looked back up at the sky to find this stunning bird, and try to thank it for saving him, but it was too late; all that he saw was that bright light slowly fading behind the mountain from which it had come. The man smiled in thanks, and set off back down the mountain.

As he was making the journey back to his hometown, he had a think about what had happened. He owed his life to this majestic, mysterious bird, and he barely knew anything about it. However, he deduced from the scattering of embers from its wings that it must have been a fire type. He decided that he would honour this Pokemon that saved him, not only by choosing to focus on raising Fire-type Pokemon over others, but to attempt to genetically recreate a Pokemon like this one at his hometown research centre.

The man's name was Blaine.

This project of genetic engineering took him many years. Over the course of these years, he made good friends with a fellow researcher at the Pokemon Mansion, who went by the name of Fuji. After a while, Blaine decided to move his personal research away from the Mansion so he did not get distracted from it, but he had nowhere. Fortunately, Fuji favoured him and supported his research, and decided to help him along. Fuji founded the Pokemon Lab, as a separate research entity to the Mansion, which Blaine could work in. Blaine was very thankful to Fuji and they stayed on good terms for a long time.

A few more years passed, and Blaine was beginning to get restless. He had dedicated a large amount of his life to this project, and he was stating to get old. But he pressed on with his research, and one day, testing on a pair of simple bug Pokemon, one male &amp; one female, he struck gold. What he produced were two not-fully-evolved bug Pokemon with the genetic code of the majestic bird's wing embers fused with their own. He was ecstatic, but soon realised that these Pokemon would have to be kept a secret; if they were anywhere near as strong as his saviour had seemed, it would be very dangerous to expose them to the people of the island. Having become not only a master of Fire-type Pokemon Trainer over the course of his life, but also quite the connoisseur of puzzles, riddles and disguise, he knew just what to do.

He built a small laboratory for the growing of the Pokemon deep inside the long-dormant volcano on Cinnabar Island - the two bugs loved the heat and cosiness of the place, it felt to them almost like a cocoon. Then, to disguise his work, he established a Pokemon Gym on the island, the first they had ever had there.

He continued to run the Gym and nurture the Pokemon for several more years. The two bugs grew shockingly quickly; they began to become more powerful and intelligent than any Pokemon that Blaine had ever seen. Eventually, when he believed them to be fully grown, he had to keep them very calm all the time; like their genetic parent, the majestic firebird, they were able to fly, and spread embers and fiery scales with every flap of their wings. Blaine decided to christen the two bugs' species Volcarona, after their place of raising and their fiery abilities, and the larva form Larvesta. He secretly wrote up their existence on the database of his fellow Pokemon researcher Oak's latest invention, the Pokedex.

One thing he wanted to find out was whether or not the two Pokemon could breed; they were of the opposite sex and had a pre-evolution form, so he saw it to be possible. He set them about on a program to breed together, and after a while, success came; the female Volcarona became pregnant with an egg.

Blaine began to relax his focus and care towards the Pokemon, seeing them to be grown enough to take care of each other, and began to focus more on his Gym duties. However, this didn't stop him losing to a pair of trainers in quick succession, one called Blue, and one called Red, who went on to both become champions of the Kanto Pokemon League.

Meanwhile, trouble was brewing between the two Volcaronas. The female disliked how Blaine kept them in this small place, and wanted to escape and be free, while the male recognised that Blaine was trying to protect them and everyone in the outside world from their uncontrollable power, and had to keep stopping the female from plotting to escape. 

A year or so passed... until suddenly the female snapped and began to fight with the male. A battle of epic proportions broke out between them inside the volcano... and their fires were so powerful, that they began to awaken the great volcano. No longer dormant, it began to erupt!

The people of Cinnabar noticed the eruption and panicked. the island was fairly small and they were not sure if they would be able to save everybody in the town in time.

The two Volcarona fought a devastating battle, and swamped the entire volcano with fire, as its own fires began to rise up into the atmosphere. Eventually, weakened by her burden of the egg, the female could not fight on, and instead flew away as fast as its wings would carry it. It needed to fly of to a place far away, where the male would never be able to find it and finally defeat it. It flew across many a sea, past Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh, until it finally reached the faraway region of Unova...

Meanwhile the male Volcarona, having been greatly influenced by Blaine during its growth and thus having a brave and pure heart, lit up the sky above Cinnabar with a gleaming light, bright enough to burst through the volcanic ash and allowing the people to gather their friends and family and escape. To most of the people, the bright light was just the sun blasting through the dark ash, but one man who had been on the island for many years recognised it for what it really was.

The man's name was Blaine. The way in which his own creation was saving the lives of his fellow Cinnabarians, just as that beautiful bird that he never did learn the name of had saved him many years ago, gave him joy, and made him feel complete.

When the island had been fully evacuated, the male Volcarona set off to the region of Unova with anger in its heart at the female for jeopardising the life of all of those people, intent on teaching it a lesson. It tracked the female by the trail of embers it left across the land and sizzling on top of the oceans and rivers. Eventually it found its way to the ancient Relic Castle, and followed the ember trail to the very deepest room in the ruins. It burst in, wings and embers bristling, but what it saw stopped it in its tracks.

The female lay there whimpering, mortally wounded by the battle they had had. The sight of her pain made him realise how foolish they had both been for fighting with each other over this, as she herself had realised too. He wept with her, and as the last bit of life seeped out of her, she finally gave birth to their egg. On her dead body, he vowed that he would find their egg a safe home, and would never venture out into the world after that, for he was too powerful and would only cause more destruction and sorrow.

He left the ruins with the egg, and searched far and wide over all of Unova, until he finally found a small, picturesque, beautiful route full of aquatic life, cliffside grass habitats and a single trainer camp atop the tallest cliff. He sensed that those who ventured here would only be those with a pure and brave heart. He left the egg outside the camp house, said one last tearful goodbye, and returned to the ruins.

Once he reached the room in which his partner had died, he made the room into a shrine to her, emblazoning her image into the wall, and vowing to never leave the place as penance to her and the rest of the world, hoping that she may look to him from the spirit world and forgive him.

A blond-haired Pokemon Ranger was returning to the camp that he and his friends had set up on Route 18, when he found something quite astounding - a small, round egg, tinted with the colours of flame and emeralds, left on the doorstep. Puzzled, he and his friends decided to take the egg in, and give it to any trainer who came to the camp that thought they may have the ability to raise this mysterious egg......

-------------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah, that's a story based on a theory I came up with a while ago. I put quite a lot of research and time into this, as you can tell, and I hope you guys enjoy it.

The way this prevents pokemon from wondering in is that it removes bordering tall grass, which pokemon almost exclusively live in. The trees act as a buffer between the town and the outside world. Not to mention most times the tree lines are so thick the player cannot pass through it, so why wouldn't it be difficult for pokemon to do so.

The reason they would want to do this is that pokemon are dangerous. For example look at syther, it's a ball of of hate with swords for hands. Imagine how fucked up your day be if one just decided to slice you up before you go to work?

Bonus: the Pineco maybe used as a secondary defence. Since many of them know explosion this would probably stop any pokemon in it's tracks. Then a ranger would come along and simply revive the pineco.

If we go by the theory that the Pokedex was written by a 10 year old, I have a reason as to why the entry may have said it would die when the flame goes out. Imagine Red, just walking along, when he suddenly sees a dead Charmander floating in a river. He notices two things :1) the Charmander is obviously dead and 2) the flame is out. Let's say the Charmander actually drowned, something Red may not know.

 When people talk about the legendary birds they always act like they're super ancient and were present for the Pokemon creation and all that.I don't agree.

I think that articuno, zapdos and moltres are actually the next step in pokemon evolution. highly adaped, super powerful pokemon that are the future. articuno is an evolved pidgeot, zapdos is a farfetch'd and moltres is a fearow.

Compare them. I basically based it on their necks, since all bird pokemon basically look the same. But articuno looks just like a pidgeot in the face, even has some of the headtail or whatever. fearow has a longer neck like moltres and zapdos has a similar V pattern on its head to the one farfetch'd has. 

I say it's because of their environment. A high-level pidgeot living in the icy, cold environment of the seafoam islands could mutate to suit that environment, evolve as it were. the same way with a farfetch;d in the power plant. I don't know about the moltres in victory road, maybe it was made in Cinnabar Volcano. I'm not saying that all pidgeot will eventually turn into an articuno, but at least one in particular was subjected to the conditions to make it happen. 

There's only one because it takes such extreme/rare conditions to cause the change, plus the fact that once a legendary bird is made, it means there's a super powerful pokemon posted keeping the rest away.

Zapdos also kind of says the legendary birds are new. how could there be so much electricity in one place before the power plant?

* You start off Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald ""moving house"", however you too are kept in the back of the truck, as if you are part of the furniture. It would be normal for a child your age to sit up front on your mom's lap next to the driver, so why are you instead kept in such a dangerous environment at the back?

* Your mom hardly cares about you, letting you roam free at such a young age. Perhaps she is simply a mechanic, placed nearby to just maintain you and make sure you undertake your mission, or ""adventure"" as such, conducting research through your onboard equipment as you progress through the region. Her close relationship to several professors throughout every game can't be coincidental...

* You have the uncanny ability to run for as long as you like without tiring out. In addition to this, you never require any form of nourishment. It is also impossible to properly sleep in the game. You can only rest in certain inns, and this is primarily to heal your Pokémon.

* You are able to carry tremendous weights, only limited by getting x999 in your bag rather than by how much you can lift. No kid should be able to lug whole fossils, gold ingots, countless potions, sprays and Pokéballs around the region like your character does.

* To top it all off, your character is able to withstand extreme pressure and climates, such as diving deep underwater with no need for breathing apparatus, or even reaching high altitudes by flying on a Pokémon. Visiting winter towns or volcanoes is no problem either, since you do not appear to feel the effects of temperature change. 

The question remains: is your character a robot or not? With previous theories of a post-war setting in the Kanto region, it could be that you once fought in that war and are a robot soldier with the appearance of a child. After the war ended, countless criminal organisations were set up in the broken world, and you along with other robots of your kind, have been shipped out to several regions to put an end to these organisations. Your ""mom"" wouldn't really let a young child like you run off and directly fight a criminal organisation on your own, would she?

Before the lives of Pokemon and People became interspersed, there was obviously some tension between the two species. Though not all were harmful, there were certainly cases of Pokemon attacking humans. Needless to say technology to counter this grew and grew, until trapping (or ""catching"") Pokemon became as simple as throwing a ball at them. 

For awhile Pokeballs were simply used for defence, catching dangerous Pokemon. But then people started realizing that these Pokemon could be used for their own devices. The company that made Pokeballs noticed this unconventional use of them, and decided to capitalize on it. They set up ""PokeMarts"", stores that sold PokeBalls and other items to aid the hunter in his quest for Pokemon. 

And, like any other smart business, they sought to expand. So they developed easier products, for the beginner hunter, looking to make the sport more widespread. 

You can probably see where this is going. When they realized Pokemon and People could live harmoniously, they saw a great opportunity. It was no longer ""hunting"", you could catch Pokemon to be your helper, your friend. So they made schools to educate people, funded research labs like Professor Oak's. And, to make sure everyone was constantly catching Pokemon and constantly training them, they built Gyms to encourage competition, and PokeCentres free of charge to aid Trainers in their quest. 

This monopoly is why PokeBalls have become the universal symbol for Pokemon. Because the whole idea of Pokemon and People living together was virtually invented by the PokeMart company. 

The only downside to all this is the restrictions the company puts on travel. In D/P, you can not visit the battle island until you beat the Elite Four. Which is a brilliant way for the PokeMart company to ensure anyone who wants to travel trains their Pokemon to the highest standard... and it'd be hard to do that without stopping by the PokeMart every once in awhile.

**TL;DR: Pokemon Trainer culture was invented by PokeMarts so they could sell a whole lot of product**

One image sticks out in particular, where Tentacruel is destroying buildings with its tentacles. **How did modern society (skyscrapers, databases) get created with such dangerous pokemon around?** Especially wild ones? 

I have a feeling wild pokemon aren't exactly wild, but rather tagged and controlled groups of pokemon placed in *very* specific areas (grass, forests, some sections of water). Strong pokemon are placed in far out locations (Victory Road, Mt. Silver). Rare pokemon have been given to private organizations to care for and manage (Safari Zone). Also, common pokemon, such as Oddish, Rattatta and Pidgey, plus their evolutions, are pretty harmless from a physical attack point of view and are given free reign. But Tauros and Magmar are rare for a reason.

Anyway I guess this is common sense, but I think it's a bit weird that wild pokemon are probably very far from being so.

I have been playing through a lot of my old games recently... FireRed here and there, Ruby, and the 4th generation ones. Mainly because something irritated me in Unova... I'll get to that.

Each region... Takes things in their own stride if you notice... Kanto seems kind of, well, like they're hiding something buy you're too young to know. So you just challenge the league like you are supposed to and move on with your life...

Johto is more upbeat, the evil organization was supposedly gone, kids are everywhere, training Pokemon, trying to be a new Champion, and the whole place feels slightly more harmonious. 

Then we get to Hoenn, where it seems like everyone is focused on Nature, making sure they are in tune with it, or the whole essence of the game feeling more, well, natural. The Pokemon are all slightly more like realistic things or forces of nature, and the land is spread out and economized less. Even the one route with a bike path was trying to stay peaceful for nature. Nothing feels extremely out of place aside from the Weather Institute. 

Sinnoh seemed to be more focused on the past, and what the origin of things are. Everyone was living slightly more slowly, even in the bigger cities where it seemed people had settled down more... And I just found where I was going with this...

Continuing on, we get to Unova. Big. Bustling. Industrialized. Booming. All good words for it. Here's a few more. Extravagant, lavish, overdone. 

It seems we've come into the time of glutton and prosperity in the Pokemon world. Unova's people are all carefree it seems, living for what they wanted, not really moving for a cause, gorging themselves on easy wealth. As a trainer, you can rack up over 1,000,000 easily in that game. You can become a star, everything is meant to be so freaking BIG.

And it makes me begin to wonder... Is this kind of like the progressions of economies before another big war, or even... a depression? Kanto was shortly after a war... And the people were more focused on wanting to tell you about how to live instead of trying to tell you about said war. They wanted to forget, aside from Surge, who was a veteran...

Johto is when life begins to pick back up, and be slightly more normal. They are the progression beyond the post-war paranoia...

Hoenn, were the people really unfazed or untouched by the war... They seem to live on their own means, and not really follow what is going on in the rest of the world, and they are also slightly disconnected from the rest.

And Sinnoh is an older community that chooses to live in their ancestry, and progress slowly.

And we get to Unova. Unova reminds me a bit too much of the Roaring Twenties. They are all extravagant, rich, and at times arrogant. The place is huge, bigger than the other regions by a longshot, and like America was during the wars, not really close or attached to the people who were involved with it. 

So, I am beginning to think, is the next generation going to be in a time of Depression? I don't think that Game Freak would do that, but it's what I am seeing. 

This ramble led to me actually seeing something, and I am surprised.

1355889271.0,130,self.pokemonconspiracies,1539lv,The Alakazami Exist as a Separate Culture,156,26,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1539lv/the_alakazami_exist_as_a_separate_culture/,"This is a theory I formed quite a while back, but which has been honed recently. The basics of the theory, for those who do not wish to read the specifics, are that the Alakazami species (Abra-Kadabra-Alakazam) exist as their own super-culture outside of human interaction, only found in a few human-controlled areas. The few Kadabra and Alakazam found in human control are by psychics, and this is related.

Now, to flesh out the theory.

**Abra** - One of the only reasons that the Alakazami are seen at all is because of the life-cycle of the Abra. Nearly unable to protect themselves, an Abra's only technique is that of teleportation, allowing the  Abra to warp to a further away locale. As noted in its pokedex entry, it will teleport away whenever it senses danger. It is thus very rare.

But, at this stage an Abra is little more than a larva. It exists in a different kind of life-state than most infants. It does not interact with most creatures, teleporting away at even the chance of interaction. But, it is telepathic, and it does eventually evolve into Kadabra... but how?

The telepathy is the key. Even in the games, Abra cannot fight on its own. The Alakazami race thrive on experience, particularly with other sentient minds. An Abra connects with every creature whom it ""reads,"" though the connection is transient. This slowly accumulates into life experience as it draws upon the memories and thoughts of the different creatures it meets. Finally, upon achieving enough of this exposure, the Abra evolves into that of Kadabra, a much more advanced form.

**Kadabra** - Kadabra is special. It is found in only three locations in the games; Route 8, Route 215, and Cerulean Cave. It is one of the rarest pokemon to find in the games, and even in those locations they are barely found. 

In fact, the Cerulean Cave makes quite a bit of sense, considering Mewtwo took up residence there. Seeking to investigate this anomalous creature, the Kadabra essentially set up scouts, looking to make contact and, if hostile, dispose of the otherwise incredible psychic creature.

The Kadabra represent the major participants of the Alakazami culture. Having gotten past the larval stage of experience-at-a-distance, the Kadabra are suddenly capable of interacting with other creatures in a meaningful way. They are psionically gifted, possessed of telepathy, telekinesis, precognition, and other useful powers. They also separate themselves almost completely from the human-controlled lands. 

The question becomes why? Why stay separate? I have only conjecture at this point, but my belief is that they do not want to become inundated with the human culture of battling. Very few pokemon demonstrate noticable sentience in the games (I thus subscribe to the theory that most are animalistic in nature and intelligence), and the fact that humans seem to seek to subjugate every creature they can find lends great credence to the idea that the Kadabra keep themselves separate for their own protection. 

Furthermore, it is obvious, even to humans, that Kadabra and Alakazam are sentient. Even if the pokedex entries are exaggerations, the fact is that even children recognize that Alakazam are vastly intellectually superior to most humans. In fact, the only humans that seem to have Kadabra or Alakazam in their parties are (to my knowledge) Psychics, humans who would understand and have empathy for another sentient creature (or possess the will to attempt control over the psychic being). 

In other words, those few Abra who are captured and evolve to Kadabra either escape on their own (which would be easy with their teleportative capabilities) or they choose to stay with their trainers out of respect. 

**Alakazam** - Alakazam offer up the final point of my argument. Found literally nowhere in the games (can only be obtained through evolution or trading), they are exceedingly rare, befitting their difficult to obtain nature. In fact, they are one of the few pokemon which evolve by trade, and this is something of import.

I have always assumed that pokemon which evolve via trade must have something important about them changed through the process. Onix and Scizor fuse with their metal coat, Clamperl reaches into some ancestral essence, &amp;c. With Alakazam, however, the change is something of an akashic field; the two pokemon are being officially changed between two trainers, and becoming ""property"" of the other, and forming a new bond. When you take into account the fact that Kadabra apparently only remain with trainers they respect, the only Kadabra which are traded must be between two individuals who have both earned its respect. It is forming a very durable, important bond with multiple individuals, reaching a point of psychic potential otherwise untapped.

Further (as noted by Doc0281), another argument would be that the evolution to Alakazam is simply an extension of the evolution of Abra to Kadabra, that of experience. The process of absorbing memories and experiences from multiple trainers on a trainer/pokemon level is one of the things which prompts the evolution.

Notably, I also believe that most pokemon which evolve through trade likely have ways of reaching said evolution without trading (exceptions being pokemon which seem to be unique cases, such as Electrivire and Magmortar), and this makes sense in Alakazam's case, since it would merely need to form a deep mental and emotional bond with multiple individuals (""merely"" here being something of a tongue-in-cheek reference).

**In Conclusion...**

The Alakazami family is a unique culture which has chosen to separate itself from human interaction due to the feeling that humans are dangerous, threatening beings who have not yet reached a widespread-enough psychic potential to exist on a truly level playing field with other psychic beings.

1356814752.0,128,self.pokemonconspiracies,15n15f,Unova is able to live in extreme wealth and extravagance at the exploitation of the other regions,151,23,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15n15f/unova_is_able_to_live_in_extreme_wealth_and/,"As many users before me have pointed out, Unova is much more advanced and richer than all the other regions to the point of gluttony and greed. It is my belief that it exploits the resources of other regions in order to maintain this standard.

First let's look at regions other than Unova, starting with Kanto. This is one of the smallest regions. In fact, it seems that it is so underdeveloped that it is currently supporting its maximum population. Notice how Kanto changes in the three year jump between the first and second generations. It gets the magnet train and radio tower, yes, but the cities don't expand, and no new developments are made. In fact, it gets even smaller because Cinnabar Island was destroyed. This, AN ISLAND CITY, couldn't even afford the necessary evacuation equipment. There weren't ANY boats at all. It's fully possible that everyone on the island died. More than that, no reconstruction or restoration has taken place. Why not? Because Kanto was being forced to export all important resources out to Unova. Furthermore, when a single part is stolen from the power plant, half of Kanto is shut down. This reveals two startling factors of just how impoverished Kanto is: 1) It apparently has only two power plants to support the entire region, and 2) it does not have the resources necessary to replace a single machine part. 

Then there's Johto, which isn't quite as bad off as Kanto. It has Goldenrod City, the largest city we see in Pokemon in the first two games. However, this is only a natural product of its colonial relationship with Unova. The city does in fact have sea access even if we see no boats in the games, so Goldenrod likely became the home and hub of middleman traders from Unova. This makes sense, as Goldenrod, even in its name, has similarities to the extravagance seen in Unova.

Third on the list we have Hoenn. Most likely it operates similarly to how the Hawaiian Islands were for the US. It provides tropical resources, and Unova has plans to convert it into a getaway resort. This is why the city of Lilycove was founded in the first place, with its contest hall, mall, and hotels: it's a place for the rich of Unova to vacation. Further supporting this tropical island theory are towns like Pacifidlog and Lavaridge, which are of little interest to foreigners and are therefore left undeveloped. Hoenn has two major port cities, Lilycove (as previously mentioned) and Slateport, with boats that can travel to those two cities or out of the region. But what about transport to other cities within the region? It's nonexistent. It doesn't benefit the Unovans to build intra-regional transport, so it's not going to happen, leaving the locals to suffer.

Lastly, we have Sinnoh, probably the best off of all of the oppressed regions. It provides huge amounts of coal from Oreburgh City, supporting the energy need in Unova. As a reward it has been provided with enough resources to remain stable. The majority of the population is happy to maintain the status quo as long as their cherished history is preserved. But we still see hints of negative influences from Unova in Sunyshore City. It is my assumption that the gym leader there, Volkner, was originally from Unova, because unlike most of the other people of Sinnoh, he has no interest in its history and isn't content to simply be with his Pokemon. He tries to find pleasure in the old extravagant ways of his homeland: technology, advancements, and power. Thus, he conducts such huge renovations on Sunyshore City that he causes a huge power outage that takes weeks to correct.

And so we come to Unova itself. Like the generation one and two games, the two sets of Unova games take place a few years apart, so we can compare the development between Kanto and Unova. As already mentioned, over the course of three years, Kanto has more or less remained stagnant and even lost a city. Unova, however, has experienced huge growth, creating four new cities and expanding old ones. Think about the path between Virbank and Castelia. You simply take a boat. No other region had enough resources for that. You would have to surf. Furthermore, Unova is the only region capable of affording a competent police squad. (They arrest Team Plasma members in the Liberty Garden.) 

Of course, all of this would be irrelevant if we were to learn that Unova actually had huge energy and food supplies. Then they could actually be self-sustaining, living independently from all the other regions, which are simply being hit by hard times. So, what do we see in terms of resource production in Unova?

In Mistralton City, a few rows of vegetables are planted. 

That is literally all Unova does to supply for itself. The only logical possibility is that they are exploiting other regions in order to maintain their high standard of living.

Their sense of smell complements their sense of hearing, allowing them to detect even the quietest mouse approaching. They have underdeveloped vocal cords, but are known to communicate through psychic power. Paraphrased from A_Wild_Abra 

**Reproduction:** ""Ok, we abra don't do much fancy to do the whole reproduction thing. For us, its just a man, a woman, and an intimate night. I assume you get the picture. Some males can be prone to homosexual relationships due to the lack of females, but of coarse this results in no children... unless they hire a ditto."" - A_Wild_Abra
Brings a whole new meaning to the word ""wild"" eh?

**Other Species Breeding:**

* ""Male - Guys are... well, since our species has more guys then girls, this makes relationships... difficult (Explain that one genetics, xy chromosomes my ass). Males can tend to be prone to try to find a mate with anything that will accept them as such, due to the lack of the species females. under our armor, we do have... uhh that stuff you humans do... I've seen abra in relationships with member of the gardevior line, jynx, gothoria, ect ect.""

* ""Female - The females, being rare and exclusive are sort of... cherished by the males. Life is a competition, and in an attempt to find someone to share it with, they have... a lot of control on who they pick. The 3:1 ratio plays well for them, and even then some abra will find males from other species. Once again females have all the bits human females have, and can breastfeed young if they so wish. Both written by A_Wild_Abra""

**Growth:** ""Abras are born from an egg after spending a long period inside their mother. (about 5-7 months) This egg is significantly small to accommodate the female abras smaller... yea. &gt;//&gt; When born the abra's head is about the size of its body. it is about 7-13 inches tall. The brain will continue to develop as the abra reaches normal size (3 foot) and the body will grow proportionally bigger."" The brain continues to develop throughout it's life, this is where Abra's psychic powers are ""stored"" and as they grow stronger over time, the brain must grow to accommodate this.

**Natural Moveset:** Abra's have incredible psychic potential, unfortunately, that's all it will ever remain as... potential. An Abra is unable to bring forth any of his psychic powers as he does not yet have control. This explains why he may learn plenty of TM's (they unlock some of his potential). Upon evolution, Abra gains a key to his psychic potential and is therefore able to use it. 

* Teleport - ""Being one of the most prominent psychic Pokemon, as well as some of the most powerful once evolved, Abra have naturally developed one self dense mechanism, run away. With their powers Abra will instantly transfer their matter through space to another point, recreating themselves in a flash of light."" Abra's teleport is actually a marvel. It is a full on teleport, not high speed movement, but the breakage of atoms. Abra splits himself into atoms, able to travel through walls, floors, and anything else in its way. Abra than uses his psychic power to reconstruct himself in another area.

**Evolution:** ""When an abra's body isn't able to contain its massive pool of psychic powers, it will evolve. This happens after 16 levels, and immediately it uses its powers to fuck with pokemons minds with an attack known as confusion. The tail will growl longer and puffier, as a sign of maturity, whiskers will develop on their face, and they will paint themselves with psychic symbols like the star and those stupid S things you drew in high school. These are mostly for decoration and attracting members of the other species. The longer the whiskers, the manlier the man, so the ultimate act of disgrace for a kadabra is having them shaven off. The spoon is created with their minds instantly from metals found in the earth."" Question: How come you've never evolved? :o
**Ability:**
 * Synchronize. ""Abra can make their opponent feel their pain with their psychic powers. Poison, burn and paralysis will essentially be copied to the pokemon that afflicted them.""

**Psy Powers:** ""Ok, explaining psychic powers is a bit difficult. In the pokemon universe there are 3 prominent powers. Life -&gt;Psychic -&gt;Dark. One beats the other, sort of like fire, water, grass. Life, or as you humans call it, fighting is what all creatures, have. Psychic, is my domain. Naturally all creature have psychic energy. Psychic pokemon can absorb, feel and use these to give them abilities. Abra sleep 18 hours a day to gather up these powers. Now when I say sleep, I don't mean 18 hours of pure REM sleep. We abra handle sleep differently. We stay mostly conscious during sleep. Our brain enters a low power mode, allowing it time to recover from the strain of having out powers. During that time, we are mentally slower, but we are still fully aware of our surroundings. When you put an abra to 'sleep' you are forcing them into REM sleep, which is unconscious dream sleep. Speaking of sleep, we keep our eyes closed during sleep so we can better sense our surroundings. Abra can feel the presence of other lifeforms approaching and will teleport when they attack. When we abra arn't sleeping, we do open our eyes. Actually, I can see out of them right now, but my vision sucks, so I need what you humans call 'glasses'.""

The only one that doesn't match up is Goldenrod having Normal-types.  Granted, Normal types are immune to Ghost, so that connection works, but there is no relationship for Bug to Normal.  I searched on Bulbapedia and other resource sites and haven't found anything to indicate that GameFreak intended for Goldenrod to be a Dark gym initially, but there is a pattern someone tried to make and left a link unattached.

Perhaps if Dark was the intended type for Goldenrod, they changed it due to Dark's Japanese name of ""Evil"" and did not want an ""evil gym leader"" (doesn't explain why we can have ""evil"" Elite Four members, but oh well).",2: GSC,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,generations,,True,t3_1emppx,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1emppx/goldenrod_city_gym_should_have_used_dark_types/,

1363300331.0,122,self.pokemonconspiracies,1abamg,Some theories about Gym Leaders,144,22,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1abamg/some_theories_about_gym_leaders/,"I've been asking myself a lot of questions about Gym Leaders and how their system works. Why are there always 8? How do they decide what types will be represented as gyms in a region? Why do you sometimes battle a Gym Leader and they have a team of two basic Pokemon, but then you go to the PWT, and they have a full roster of kick-ass team-wreckers?

Here are some answers:

The 8 gyms in a region that you visit in the games are not the only gyms. There are others, which are also sanctioned by the Pokemon League and have their own type specialties and badges. We've seen a lot of evidence for this in the anime (when other characters carry badges which we can't identify, or when Gary has 10 badges) and also a little form the games (what if the dojo in Saffron City used to be a Fighting-type gym?).
The reason your character only collects 8 is because that is the minimum requirement to enter the respective Leagues. 

Also, not every trainer starts in Pallet/New Bark/Twinleaf/etc. For example, an aspiring trainer may start in Sootopolis City, which for the player character is the 8th gym, but for them would be the 1st. In that case, the Gym Leader reserves the right to use a team that is at an appropriate difficulty for the trainer. It wouldn't be fair for Wallace/Juan to use their 5-man fully-evolved Water-type team on a rookie trainer. They probably would use a much simpler team for the Sootopolis trainer to get their first badge. Then for example that Sootopolis trainer's 8th badge can be Lavaridge, and in that scenario, Flannery wouldn't use her Slugma-Torkoal team like she does for the player, but rather something more advanced, like Magcargos and Camerupts.

This right to reserve their strongest teams for tougher trainers would also explain why the Gym Leaders in BW2 all have ludicrously strong teams compared to the ones you see in their gyms.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1abamg,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1abamg/some_theories_about_gym_leaders/,

I came across Drake's entry. In case you're unfamiliar, Drake is the final member of the Hoenn Elite 4, and is a Dragon trainer. His match call entry says why he chose to be a Dragon trainer, and I quote:

'I dedicate myself to the Pokemon that saved me.'

Clearly he's talking about Dragon Pokemon. But what did they save him from? My answer - the Abandoned Ship, also known as the SS Cactus.

As we can see from Drake's hat, he was a sailor of some sort at some point in his life. This is further backed by the anime, which portrays him as a ship captain (yes, I know the anime doesn't follow game canon, but I have my reasons).

What I think is that Drake was a sailor on the Cactus on the voyage that she sank. Now, obviously the ship didn't completely sink, so perhaps the sailors were stranded. Or, as I believe, Drake was below deck, where the ship flooded. He would've been stuck down there, unable to escape when he was saved.

Now, here's an issue. No Dragon Pokemon are remotely near Route 108. So what saved him?

Latios and Latias. The roaming Dragon legendaries of Hoenn. As shown by their movesets, they can learn Dive, which shows that they have the capabilities to dive below deck and save Drake. 

So, after they pullede Drake from below deck and then flew off, Drake decided to dedicate himself to the Dragon Pokemon that saved him from the sinking of the SS Cactus.",3: RSE,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,generations,,True,t3_17jw43,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/17jw43/the_abandoned_ship_and_drake/,

Basically the theory goes like this: A long time ago Pikachu started off as an egg. This egg came into the possession of a girl who hatched it into a Pichu. Pichu became so attached to the girl that it eventually leveled up and evolved into Pikachu. One day, however, the girl got attacked by a biker gang (Why? I haven't figured that out). Pikachu wanted to help, but something happened that caused him to be stuck in its pokeball. The girl was beaten into a coma and Pikachu was so traumatized by the event that he blocked it from his memory (alternatively: he still remembers it, and that's why he was such a jerk to Ash in the beginning). However Pikachu could still remember somethings such as a hatred of being stuck in a pokeball. Professor Oak found out about the incident and came across Pikachu's pokeball. He repaired the pokeball, but he realized the pokemon inside was incredibly angry and possibly dangerous and decided it was best to leave Pikachu in there for now. In order to make sure he didn't forget to not release Pikachu he labeled the pokeball with a lightning bolt sticker (as seen on Pikachu's pokeball in the first episode). He fully intended to return Pikachu to his orginal trainer, but as the years passed the more and more unlikely it seemed she would ever wake up (alternatively: she passed away. Either due to her injuries, or her parents or some else deciding to pull the plug). One day Ash came along, and Professor Oak, realizing how much he wanted a pokemon and that it would probably be good way to help Pikachu get over what happened to his original trainer, decided to pair them with each other.

**Reproduction:** Pikachu reproduction is very similar to that of a common field mouse. The penetration of the penis into the vagina, where internal fertilization occurs.  Birth occurs within twenty days and the baby is hairless.  Within a week, the baby has grown fur, though it looks significantly different than the adult Pikachu.
Due to this difference, it has led scientists to dub this baby Pikachu a new Pokemon; Pichu.  All Pokemon have a baby stage, though most quickly grow out of it, Pichu however; could theoretically stay a baby it's entire life.  The change from Pichu to Pikachu will be discussed in the evolution section.

**Growth:** The baby is born small, hairless and with tiny ears.  Within a week fur has grown, taking on a light yellow colour, and black around the edges, as well as well developed ears and a small tail.  There are a few reasons for the classification between Pichu and Pikachu.  Pichu only reaches about 0.3m, which is slightly shorter than Pikachu (0.4m), and 2.0kg, Pikachu is 6.0kg.  Though the differences between Pichu and Pikachu in terms of height and weight are not quite enough to warrant a separation.  The main difference is that Pichu cannot reproduce.  No baby form of any Pokemon can reproduce, however; Pichu remains a baby for significantly longer periods than most other babies.

**Nutrition:** Nothing special here, an omnivorous mouse.

**Pichu's Natural Moveset:**

* Thundershock - Pichus are born with the ability to discharge electricity from their cheeks (in fact it is necessary for the Pichu to discharge often in order to prevent a build up).  Because they are babies, they are not able to control this ability as well as a more mature Pikachu, and thus have little control over the power of their electricity.  Thundershock is an electric shock shot in various directions in the hope of striking it's opponent.

* Charm - Being a baby Pokemon, Pichu is instantly given the ""cute"" status and can easily avoid confrontation.

* Tail Whip - A Pichu can distract opponent's by waving it's tail around.

* Thunder Wave - A Pichu is able to send out a circular shock wave.  This wave has very little shock value, however; it is able to mess with a living creature's nervous system, temporarily slowing them.  In the wild this is often used so that Pichu is able to detect any nearby predators or prey without actually searching.

* Sweet Kiss - Would you be confused if this little mouse shocked you with a bolt of electricity, then proceeded to run up to you and give you a kiss on the cheek? Yeah, me too.

* Nasty Plot - Behind that cute visage, is a malicious mind.  Pichu has become accustomed to living in fear of constant battling and as such has devised certain means to increase the power of it's electricity attacks.

**Pikachu's Natural Moveset:**

* Growl - A young Pikachu can growl at opponents along with a slight discharge of lightning from the cheeks, unnerving even the toughest of opponents, lowering their attack.
* Quick Attack - Pikachu has lost most of it's ""baby fat"" and is able to move at extremely quick speeds, slamming into their opponent's at high velocity.

* Electro Ball - Pikachu generates a large amount of electricity in its cheeks and begins to mold it into the form of a ball.  Due to a lack of maturity, Pikachu is unable to add any true velocity to fire off the ball.  Thus Pikachu must use his own speed to charge his opponents and hit them directly with the electricity.  The ball quickly loses power after it has become fully charged, therefore, the faster the opponent, the less power Pikachu is able to deliver the attack with. 
(This one is kind of tough to explain, if it needs a better explanation, please leave a comment and I'll try to fix it up).

* Double Team - Another gift of Pikachu's speed, moving at extremely quick paces to create the illusion of multiple Pikachus.

* Slam - Pikachu trades some of his speed for more power, creating a stronger attack than Quick Attack, but losing it's guaranteed initial strike.

* ThunderBolt - Pikachu's ThunderBolt is a very direct strike of lightning.  Electro Ball utilizes power and molding, however, it loses the ability to fire off the attack.  Thunder Bolt utilizes power and the ability to fire off the attack, forgoing molding (which increases the concentration of the attack). 

* Feint - Pikachu uses his speed to get around another Pokemon's ""protect or detect"" and strike at a weak point using a quick body check.

* Agility - Pikachu is able to boosts his speed to incredible heights.

* Discharge - Pikachu is able to unleash a huge amount of electricity.  This attack utilizes only power, dealing extreme damage to anyone nearby, be they friend or foe. 

* Light Screen - Pikachu is able to mold it's electricity into a force field of sorts, protecting himself from other special attacks.  This force field is strong enough to disrupt special attacks, but unable to disrupt physical objects.

* Thunder - Pikachu is finally able to use the three abilities together.  Molding, power and launching, all in one super attack.  This is Pikachu's strongest attack.

**Pikachu Evolution:** Upon gaining enough ""happiness"" Pichu is able to evolve.  In the wild, this happiness or love is given by it's parents, in captivity, it is given by the trainer.  Once Pichu has gained enough happiness, a special hormone protein (dubbed evolvatase) in it's brain is released.  Evolvatase removes a particular inhibitory protein (dubbed evoinhibatase) in Pichu's body that was causing a sort of negative feedback that inhibited further growth and evolution.  Without this hindrance, Pichu is able to grow once again.  Not many changes are included, however; Pikachu does grow to a larger size as well as growing more yellow fur to cover some of the black fur of Pichu.

Special thanks again to Daanieljabugan for putting the correct words in my mouth.

**Raichu Evolution:**  Upon evolution, Pikachu releases an immeasurable amount of electricity and surrounds his body.  This electricity is thought to char his fur, creating an orangish colour around the edges, and completely burning out the fur in the center (creating the white colour).  This electricity stimulates the nervous system, creating a quick growth; including the tail which grows to be much skinnier and longer.  This is what causes Raichu to take on his characteristic form.

**Abilities:**

* Static - Pikachu/Pichu is discharging electricity at all times in the hopes of preventing a build-up.  Thus when physical contact is made, it is likely that the opponent's nervous system could be messed up, causing paralysis.

1371464122.0,119,self.pokemonconspiracies,1giaim,The Mysterious Absol- The 4th Legendary Beast?,134,15,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1giaim/the_mysterious_absol_the_4th_legendary_beast/,"**Absol Theory**

*Hypothesis:* Absol is related to Entei, Raikou and Suicune.

*History of the three legendary beasts*
150 years before the events of Gold, Silver and Crystal took place there was a great tower called the Brass Tower. This tower was famous as it was where the legendary guardian of the seas ‘Lugia’ perched. One day this tower burnt down mysteriously, and Lugia fled never to return. Amongst the destruction of the tower three unknown Pokémon were killed. Whilst on his journey to find a pure-hearted trainer, Ho-Oh returned to the tower and revived the three Pokémon. These Pokémon are known as the three legendary beasts Raikou, Entei and Suicune.  

*The Mysterious Absol*
Absol is first introduced in Generation III (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald). Information concerning Absol is quite limited. However it does state that Absol can live over 100 years. Plus when he appears in front of people, he is followed by natural disasters such as earthquakes or tidal waves. This leads Absol and his origin to be shrouded in mystery. 
The history of Absol is not clear, as there are no specific references to where they came from and it’s purpose. However if the pieces of information that are around are put together we can make an educated evaluation to what it could be.

*History of Absol*
Absol was introduced in Gen III as a native from the Hoenn region. If we follow the ‘Contemporary History’ of the Pokémon universe, we can see that Absol’s generation existed whilst the events of the Brass tower were taking place.
 
*Similarities*
Upon first look, Absol looks like a goat, however closer inspection shows us that he is in fact from a feline species. We know this from his mane and cat-like face. We know Raikou as being a tiger-like creature, Entei to be a lion, and Suicune being either a leopard or cat like feline. With this in mind, we can conclude that these Pokémon may be related due to their looks alone. However there is more proof that they could be related.
The legendary beasts are all in charge of an element or realm that causes natural disasters; this is shown in their species type. Raikou, the thunder Pokémon, has the power to create storms, which in turn leads to tornado’s and alike. Entei has the power of volcanoes, this in itself is a natural disaster, but in order for volcano’s to happen seismic activity must be present. This leads us to believe that Raikou also has power of earthquakes. Finally,Suicune, the aurora Pokémon. Aurora being water, verified by the fact it is also a water type, leads us to believe that it has power over water based natural disasters e.g. tidal waves and floods. 
Absol is known as the disaster Pokémon, as mentioned above he is mysterious and not much is known about him. This could mean one of two things, either Absol is in charge of disasters or he prevents disasters. The answer to this may determine what theory is more correct.

*Theory 1*
Absol was created with the purpose to oppose the three legendary beasts Raikou, Entei and Suicune. There is plenty of evidence for this theory. 

The theory suggests that Absol opposes the three legendary beasts. This is done through Absol warning the victims of the natural disasters ahead of time. Unfortunately for Absol it often takes the blame for these disasters, when all it is trying to do is save people’s lives and livelihood. 

The reason Absol doesn’t resort to physical aggression to stop these disasters from happening is it knows that the legendary beasts are stronger than it. This is obvious by the clear height and weight difference between them. 

There are two possible way’s in which this theory can pan-out.
1.	Absol was created at the same time as the legendary beasts by Ho-oh. However Absol saw the damage that the disasters caused the innocent people and left their ranks. Now Absol spends their time warning people about the oncoming disasters.
2.	Lugia created Absol to counteract Ho-oh’s creations. This would make sense, as there is no solid evidence as where Absol originated. Plus it may be so as Lugia needs Pokémon whom can access the land and not be seen as threatening by innocent people. With a Pokémon like Absol Lugia may have a higher chance of success for people listening to his warnings. 

*Theory 2*
Absol was created the work hand in hand with the legendary beasts. This theory has two main tangents to it.
1.	The Absol species were created at the same time as the Legendary Beasts to be their messengers. This can be easily described as a resemblance to Angels delivering messages of destruction to areas or villagers. This idea is reinforced by the fact Absol can live up to 100 years old.
2.	Absol was created at the beginning of time as a small species; later on they were adopted by Ho-oh to work for his latest creations, the Legendary Beasts.
Conclusion
By now it is clear that Absol is somehow related to Raikou, Entei and Suicune. The outstanding physical resemblance holds an obvious connection and the Pokedex entries of Absol collaborate to back up the theories presented. 

My conclusion as the author of this idea would be theory 1.2, Lugia created Absol to counteract Ho-ohs creations. This idea just shows the temperament of the Absol and the reason why they have constant dedication to warn villages about the disasters.  
However this is only what I think, I’m sure there are many other theories out there that may be able to collaborate with this one to get us closer to the truth behind the mystery of Absol.

The End.

I believe that starter Pokemon are doled out on a first come first serve basis about once a year, this would explain why Ash was planning on waking up early to go to Oaks lab and why he almost didn't get a pokemon because he was late and the lack of opposing trainers with starter pokemon. Also, if a person were either too young to recieve a starter pokemon or too late to recieve one, they could have someone else (parent, other trainer, etc.) catch one of the wild pokemon for them to raise.

1351810471.0,121,self.pokemonconspiracies,12hf50,On Inorganic Poison-Types,140,19,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12hf50/on_inorganic_poisontypes/,"So this post got me thinking:

http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/129k4h/trubbish/

To paraphrase /u/Smartio: Trubbish is essentially a grimer that has taken refuge in a full trash bag as a way to stay moist and has subsequently integrated the trash into its body. When the once-grimer reaches the stage that it would evolve into the much larger muk, it bursts its garbage bag and becomes a garbodor.


I really like this theory, but it made me think about the nature of these two pokemon lines and as well as the koffing line, also an inorganic poison type. How could they come about? Did sewage and pollution really just suddenly gain sentience? How does that fit in with the whole ""all the regular pokemon come from mew"" thing? And I think the answer is ditto.


Now, I'm going off the idea that ditto are essentially failed mew (everybody knows, we get it), but this all works without that, by just accepting that ditto came from mew in some fashion.


In my opinion it all boils down to this: grimer are polluted ditto and the three inorganic poison lines are basically different forms of the same line.

So here it goes...

Ditto are morphically unstable, they, of course, can shift endlessly into an equally endless number of forms, but not if they are exposed to certain man-made toxins. Much like the mutations caused in fish, frogs, birds, etc in our own world as a result of pollution, ditto is likewise affected. After long exposure to these toxins and pollutants, a ditto loses its ability to transforms and essentially breaks down into living ""sludge"", known as a grimer. However, even though this pollution has permanently altered their cellular structure and altered their already unstable dna, due to their ditto-ancestry they are supremely adaptable and so grimers can ""breed"" to create new grimers, rather than producing a ditto. And so what was surely once a population of polluted ditto during the early PokeIndustrial Revolution, has become a breeding population of grimer which perpetuates itself in the unending stream of pollution and waste created by humans.

Now, where there's people, there's trash. Given the much more populous nature of the Unova region, it has even more trash. So much so that it has begun piling up in landfills. The local grimer population has (as stated by /u/Smartio) taken to inhabiting the garbage found in the dumps in an effort to keep themselves moist. The grimer which reside in the sewers of Unova have a constantly damp environment and so remain grimers, having no reason to fear desiccation. Just like grimers, trubbish and garbadors can produce more of themselves, rather than reverting to grimers (presumably there must be unused garbage bags nearby).

The koffing line, in my opinion, in the opposite of the trubbish line. They're what happens when a grimer cannot find a way to prevent itself from drying out. As the outer surface of a grimer dries out, it thickens and becomes not unlike hard rubber. It continues to produce toxic gases (which grimer is documented as doing), but without a liquid exterior theses gases build up inside until eventually this pre-koffing achieves liftoff and becomes a full-fledged koffing. Following the same lifecycle as grimer (since it is essentially still a grimer), the koffing eventually reaches the point where it would typically expand into a muk, but given its new bouyant, rubbery nature it expands differently. Almost like a hernia, the weakest section(s) of the koffing's walls expand outward, forming new, branching sections of ""bubbles"" and becoming a weezing. Now, just like its cousins, koffing's easily editable DNA means it can breed new koffings. This also triggers something in the koffing-to-weezing transition forcing some of the new ""bubbles"" to gain a semblance of sentience, almost like little proto-koffings. Being even more unstable than trubbish and grimers, weezings are necessarily loosely defined and can be formed in analternate way than described above. Two koffings may stick together and eventually form a functioning weezing. Likewise, a proto-koffing may split off from a weezing forming a new koffing and gaining full sentience.

TL;DR: http://i.imgur.com/yoaRc.jpg

**EDIT:** It has been brought to my attention that the Pokemon mansion not only supports this theory, but may, in fact, be the ""ground zero"" for it all.

It is generally accepted that ditto are essentially failed mew clones created when scientists attempted to clone mew. The final results of their experiments, Mewtwo, escapes and destroys the lab. This frees the newly-created dittos, but also destroys lab equipment. It is not hard to imagine that certain toxic chemicals, used in either the cloning process or other experiments being carried out in the mansion, are released into the environment where the dittos can come into contact with them. 

After the abandonment of the mansion, grimers and koffings developed and eventually spread from Cinnabar Island, both able to travel easily, grimers in the water and koffing floating on the ocean winds, and both without the need to really eat anything. Once this initial population made landfall on the Kanto mainland, it would have taken them no time at all to adapt to the abundance of waste and pollution created by people. And since they would be filling a niche that had never existed up until that point, and given their toxic nature, there would be nothing to check their growth or spread.

And that's why you find ditto in the lower, still-intact level of the pokemon mansion, and the koffing and grimer lines upstairs.

 This is pretty simple and obvious, i'm pretty sure a lot of you guys already thought the same. Everybody knows there's a lot of odd pokédex entries, like *""If you're burned by a Houndoom, the pain will never go away""* and even IMPOSSIBLE ones like Alakazam having more than **5000** IQ, that's ridiculous. 

* BUT, what if, it's just a myth? or folklore? a popular tale? a fairy tale? an old gramps story? thinking this way, it makes sense. 

* Think with me IRL now, here's an example, Moses parted the sea in two right? it's a tale, some believe, some don't, but everybody knows at least this part of the story right? Right. Now think about pokémon, let's see.. *Kyogre*, pokedéx says that it's believed that Kyogre made the entire ocean, some believe, some don't, looks a little impossible to me, but for some don't, it is not proved. See where i'm getting? No?

* Let's try another example, it's said that when someone have a good memory, this person have ""Elephant memory"" (at least in my country), or if you eat ants, your eyesight will improve. Let's try to make these two beliefs into pokédex entries and see if they can pass as legit?
 
Donphan (elephant pokémon): *it is said that Donphan remembers everything it does since it is born as a Phanpy.* Makes more sense to me than ""donphan can destroy a house with one hit""

Trapinch (ant pokémon): *in some cultures, it is believed that eating Trapinchs, improves your eyesight.*

* Got it now? Maybe the pokédex, is just some future like book about animal myths, tales, beliefs and scientific description all together. Your player travels the world collecting extra data that he learns from the locals, the places he visits. 

In BW before catching the Musketeer trio, you talk to an old man, that tells you the history of the 3 pokés, he's an old man passing down the trio's tale. There's also a city where all the people go home at night because they are afraid of a pokémon that comes out of a hole at night, maybe one day that will be the said poké's pokédex entry. Not to mention the Zoroark event that disguises himself as a woman and as one of the legendary trio dogs. Imagine that this Zoroark that disguised himself as a woman event got famous and turned into a popular tale, then one day a trainer hears the tale and register it in his pokédex ""it is said that Zoroark disguises himself as humans so it can live better"", looks legit right? Maybe one day, a single kid got lost because of a single Hypno, and now everybody thinks they kidnap children, got it finally? Popular stories turning into tales, that are registered in the pokédex.


**AND**


 That explains why a world-renowed poké professor like prof. Oak gave pokédex to some kids, maybe he just wanted some extra-data, something he did not know about pokémon, the little things, besides the science part he himself researched. 

* He's a pokémon professor god damn it, what a 10 years old kid can teach to a world renowed top poké professor about pokémon? Or maybe it's his way to get Red and Blue into pokémon, and is searching for the very best to succeed him? Or both? Think about it, in the original games, the code for a fight with prof.Oak was still in the game, and he was the highest lv trainer in RBG, stronger than the champion. I think the professor title prof.Oak have is way more important than Champion, don't you guys think? Why prof.Oak knows so much about pokémon? Because he was definetely a badass trainer, and to be a badass trainer, you need to know a lot. So he is maximizing the (already high) potential Red and Blue have, and doing this he can witness the rise of a new pokémon master to succeed himself.

1365625253.0,115,self.pokemonconspiracies,1c343p,On Mr. Mime and Jynx,134,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1c343p/on_mr_mime_and_jynx/,"In my previous submission titled ""A farfetch'd theory"", I ended the post speculating on the origins of Mr. Mime and Jynx.  Over my lunch hour, I dug a bit deeper and looked at the viability of this idea and developed a theory that paints another dark picture of the human-pokemon interaction.  As stated in my previous post, the human-farfetch'd relationship is quite dark - in fact, most of us would be disgusted to entertain the notion of slaughtering these cute little monsters for our own personal benefit.  The Mr. Mime and Jynx origin delves even deeper into the human psyche, with implications that most of us would be uncomfortable imagining. For that, I caution you to stop reading right here if you are upset easily.

---

The Theory:

* The original Mr. Mime and Jynx are the lovechilds of a human who did the dirty with a ditto.

Note: I eratta'd the theory to include the phrase ""The original"" because of the fact that they can be bred to produce more offspring of the same species.

---

Supporting Evidence:

* Colour scheme: If you look at the pre-evolutions of these pokemon, you will see that they are both pink.  This links them back to one of their parents/ancestors, ditto. 

* Body structure: Both of these pokemon take on humanoid forms.  If you look at the pre-evolutions you might say that they should have some human-like traits. The pre-evolutions have 'hair' on top of their head and are bipedal - much like human offspring.  (Okay, you might say that I'm grasping for straws here, but what else is there to say on physiology?)  You may argue that these pre-evolutions look nothing like a human apart from the 2 similarities I listed above.  To that I say: have you looked at a baby recently?  They look friggin' weird! I rest my case. 

* Special abilities: In mating with a human, the ditto's DNA was encorporated, giving the offspring pokemon special abilities that a human would not otherwise possess. Pretty straight forward.  However, these powers are why we categorize Mr. Mime and Jynx as pokemon, and not human.  If Mr. Mime and Jynx were categorized as human, this would essentially open an ethical can of worms (humans that quite clearly have special abilities, blah blah).  We already know that in the pokemon universe, young kids are taught to capture pokemon and make them fight against eachother.  In the real world, this would amount to cock/dog fights - 'activities' that are deemed unethical.  So we have established that in the pokemon universe, people are OK with operating in the moral grey zone, backing up the notion that Mr. Mime and Jynx can be categorized as pokemon and not human, and we'll leave it at that.

* More on origins:  In generation 1, the only way to obtain these pokemon were by trading.  Other than that, these pokemon were unobtainable in the wild, and only a few other trainers had them.  I theorize that the gen 1 Mr. Mimes and Jynx's would have been the first 'batch' of human/ditto babies.  In some later generations, some games only allowed you to obtain these pokemon through trading.  Other games would allow you to obtain these pokemon through breeding.  Some games had the appearance of these pokemon in the wild, and for these, I theorize that they exist as a result of some trainers releasing their Mr. Mimes/Jynx's to the wild, and having these pokemon produce offspring of their own.

---

The darker side of Mr. Mime's origin:

* Gender: Introductory genetics will teach you that a human father can pass on either an X or a Y chromosome to his offspring.  Passing on an X chromosome will lead to a baby girl, and passing on a Y chromosome will lead to a boy, given that the mother passes on an X chromosome.  2 Y chromosomes would not lead to viable offspring.  As such, it is quite reasonable that Mr. Mimes are found in ratios of 50% male and 50% female, provided that the mother ditto provided an X chromosome.  This leads to my theory that the original Mr. Mime was conceived by a **human male** and a ditto.  If a ditto transformed into human form by copying this human male's DNA, the ditto would be able to pass on either X or Y chromosome. As stated before, if both partners passed on Y chromosomes, the offspring would not be viable.  However, any other combination would lead to a viable offspring.

* Implication: In gen 1, the original Mr. Mime's owner (most likely the original father) is in a rush to get rid of this abomination.  This probably speaks to the father's guilty conscience doing the dirty with ditto.  He wants to give away his baby; he cannot believe he actually went through with the mating and wants to forget about it.  Some other trainers that have Mr. Mime I theorize to have also gotten as a trade from the father, or are the Mr. Mime fathers themselves, who embraced their lovechild.

* Moveset: Mr. Mime's moveset builds off of the guilty conscince from his father.  The overall theme is that the father regretted his decision, and should have at least used protection when doing the dirty.  Let's take a look at some of Mr. Mime's moves: wide guard, barrier, reflect, safeguard.  Pretty self explanatory (lol).  Some of Mr. Mime's other moves speak to the father's personality: double-slap (he was probably abusive, backed up by the fact that he traded away his son), encore (he probably did the dirty more than once), trick (for all we know, the ditto could have been coerced into doing the dirty!). Other moves, such as 'confusion' speak to Mr. Mime's inner conflict.  ""Why do I exist?"" ""Why did my father abandon me?"" ""Am I a human or a pokemon?""  Yes, many questions left unanswered, but interesting indeed.

---

The darker side of Jynx's origin:

* Gender: Introductory genetics will teach you that a human mother can only pass on an X chromosome to her offspring.  Jynx is always found as a female.  Why? Because the original parents were a **female human** and a ditto.  When the ditto transforms to human form for the purpose of breeding, it would have only been able to pass on an X chromosome, since the transformation came from a female.  The human female would also only be able to pass on an X chromosome, leading to every offspring in this interaction to have XX chromosomes - (it's a girl).

* Implication: See the Mr. Mime explanation.  Same story, but from the mother's point of view.  In gen 1, Jynx is obtained from a female trainer in Cerulean city.

* Moveset: Jynx's moveset also has roots in her parents' traits.  I theorize that Jynx's mother was a mean, promiscuous woman who regretted her decision to do the dirty with a ditto (or... was up for some experimentation).  Jynx was an accident, and she knew it.  Being a female, and really emotional, Jynx felt betrayed, that the world was against her.  Some would say... she became ice cold.  Which leads to her ice archetype and ice-type moves: powder snow (frozen tears), ice punch (angry at the world, wants to let her frustration out), avalanche, and blizzard (really pissed off now!).  Some of Jynx' other moves come directly from her mother's personality: pound (lol), lick (LOL), body slam, lovely kiss,  double slap (she was into it), fake tears, mean look, wake-up slap (just in case he fell asleep). Did I also mention that you could tutor Jynx to learn the move: role play? And isn't it weird that she can learn the HM: flash? Mommy issues indeed....

There are far too many discrepancies between the many mediums to use more than one of them, and I find the games the most interesting. I'm still not sure if the Ranger games contradict anything from the core games, so I leave them out of consideration for now. 

Further, I think this should be obvious but I'll reiterate it anyway: these are things I've noticed in the games, tried to make sense of, done my best to do so. Please, if you see a discrepancy bring it up; I'd like to further my theories by having more information.

That said, let's move on.

**1) The Mew Hypothesis**
Everyone's heard the usual theory on Mew. A creature that learns any move, has all the DNA of every pokemon, is very powerful, created Mewtwo when it was cloned, &amp;c, &amp;c. What never fails to amaze me about this, however, is the fact that, from all the evidence present, people continue to actually believe that Mew is the origin of all other pokemon. Let's take this apart piece by piece.

Mew has DNA from every single pokemon. Got it. I could see how people who don't know anything about evolutionary theory might think that this means all pokemon must come from it, but other people shouldn't take this as true, or even give it credence! Genetics is not some kind of amalgamation of every gene that came before it. Genomes change, mutations occur, natural selection leads to new creatures. A creature further down the evolutionary line might have a genetic structure resembling the previous, but it will be morphed, changed, and, most important of all, *it will have the entirety of the previous genome, plus some.* The previous creature, the prehistoric creature, will not possess the genes of the new pokemon. That makes no sense. There is no Ultimate Blueprint of genetics that every creature descended from.

So, then, why would someone think that Mew, which possesses all of the genes of all other pokemon, came first? If anything, it should have come last, being some kind of bizarre genetic experiment. Or, another possibility that I have described before, that Mew is a genetic thief, adapting to other conditions by absorbing beneficial genes from those it transforms into. I've gone into this theory in greater detail here: http://domriso.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3de4bu

In short: the idea that Mew is the origin of all pokemon is complete and utterly wrong, and I think this adds a bit of credence to the idea that the pokedex is made up of a bunch of ten year-olds being the ones to write most of it. 

**2) The Pokedex Issue**
This one actually has been detailed, so this is a bit of a rehash, but I do want to throw my own ideas into the mix. Yes, it's obvious that the pokedex entries are not 100% accurate. That said, if the obviously false ones are ignored while the ones that seem plausible are taken to be true, and the iffy ones assumed true, but made note that they could be wrong, you come to a rather sad realization: the pokemon world is full of near magic, and technology is amazing. 

...Okay, not so amazing, but look at it like this. Things that we know exist in the pokemon world: time travel, extreme metamorphosis, biomolecular technology, energy to matter converters, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The pokemon universe is weird.

In short: I support the idea that much of the pokedex entries are hearsay or hyperbole, but that some is very likely completely true, and that makes it an awesome resource.

**3) The Nature of Evolution in the Pokemon Realm**
Now, this one is a bit different, but you know how Evolution in the pokemon world (Evolution with a capital 'E' referring to a Charmander becoming a Charmeleon, not the gradual process of genetic shift) seems very prevalent, but not completely everywhere? And how some Evolutions seem weird (some pokemon need to be happy, some pokemon need to beat other pokemon up, some just seem to be based on time, &amp;c.)? This is my theory.

The pokemon genome is highly mutable, but also highly complex. There are literally hundreds of thousands of possible metamorphoses available to different pokemon (like how some have different forms), with Evolutions just being the most obvious form. Some pokemon only seem to Evolve when presented with radiation (Eevee, Magnemite, anything using a stone), but some somehow Evolve when presented with created objects (like Magmar and Electabuzz). Why is it that technological objects, natural objects, radiation and the like, can have such effects? I think it's literally that pokemon can actively change based on connections with other things. Hell, some pokemon seem to have quite literally arisen from inanimate matter and become living (Grimer, Voltorb, Trubbish). Why shouldn't random radiation influence their metamorphoses?

Furthermore, it has been noted that Evolutions pack massive amounts of energy in them. It isn't simply a matter of there being a normal metamorphosis, like a locust on Earth. No, Evolution in the pokemon world seems to change a pokemon in a huge way, altering them in ways that just don't seem natural. Even Team Galactic has an interest in the power contained within an Evolution. 

**4) Why People Fight**
This one is sort of my counter theory to the Kanto War theory. While I think the War Theory is interesting, I also don't really believe it, in light of the later generations. There were simply too many people who just seemed to instantly recover, and the world just generally doesn't seem to bear the right problems for a war to have been fought. 

My contention is that people fight because, quite literally, they have to in order to survive. 

First evidence: even young children fight, with ten year olds going out and adventuring around (even assuming that the protagonists and company are atypical, there are still a bunch of trainers everywhere, and many are young). But, ten years old is practically ancient compared to others. You can literally go into a playground and beat up preschoolers in Black and White, and they even partake of tournaments! It's insane!

Second evidence: the safest places to travel are in cities and towns. Pokemon swarm through any areas that aren't actively patrolled; even the routes between cities are packed full of wild, feral pokemon. But, travel outside of these ""safe"" areas and the stakes become even worse. All of the Pokemon Leagues are located far away from other civilization, their routes being even more dangerous than normal. If those are the places normally traveled, then how dangerous are the completely unpopulated areas? Probably pretty frickin' scary.

With these things in mind, my belief is that the Pokemon League is basically a modern thing. Gym Leaders used to exist in a sort of town mayor position, obtaining their position because they could best protect the town. Others trained under them to become stronger and to help protect their homes. The Pokemon League is a modern reinterpretation of the natural Gym state, turning the naturally occurring training into a competition, because that helps to build up a better reason for people to travel, and to better prepare people for more fights. 

Certainly, professors and other professions are important, but I think that it's the intense focus on fighting that keeps the pokemon regions safe.

**5) How People Control Pokemon**
First off, let me get this out there. I don't think that most pokemon are sentient. I think they're animalistic and bestial and that communications between humans and pokemon are naturally inhibited by this. Likewise, I don't think that pokemon respond to ""the pure hearts of humans,"" as is implied many times in the games. If the many different villainous teams aren't examples enough of mistreating pokemon, there's always the rival in Gold and Silver who quite obviously abuses his pokemon, and yet they obey just as well as normal. 

This seems to imply that there is some kind of control exerted over the pokemon by humans. Some have said that there is nanochips or other technology in the pokeballs, but I also think that's bull. There are many, many accounts of pokemon and humans working alongside each other throughout the history of the pokemon world, and it's well known that pokeballs, as they exist now, are a recent development. Even though apricot balls existed back then, the technology for using mind control seems to have been years ahead.

So, if it's not mind control tech, what is it? I think it's psychic abilities.

Here's my reasoning: One, almost everyone fights with only a single pokemon at a time. Rather than just a gaming convention, I think this is an actual aspect of the pokemon world. Humans exert a kind of ""subtle psionic control"" over their pokemon, allowing them to make them obey. But, using this control on multiple pokemon is difficult, and completely outside the bounds of most people. So, in the past, most people only had a single pokemon, their pokemon, making them more like lifelong partners than simple teams to fight with. People like the protagonists of the games, whom can fight with two pokemon at once, are rare. If you notice, most double battles that are fought in the games are two against one, with only the protagonists using two at once. Even more, the triple battles are actually just single battles with a weird format of switching. It's not three pokemon truly at once. And, even though there are three pokemon out at once, implying some level of control over all three at once, triple battles are a ""new development,"" and only a few people do it; probably because it's incredibly stressful. 

As a sort of side evidence for the fact that humans have psychic abilities, we have the fact that there are some people who exhibit very overt psionics, such as the psychics and whatnot, but they are rather rare. Then again, we have Mewtwo, who was supposedly a clone created by mixing human DNA with Mew's (and, if Mew has all DNA, why would that matter?), and then Mewtwo comes out being basically the most powerful Psychic pokemon there is. Sure, Mew was a psychic, but Mew also learned all techniques. Mewtwo was not nearly so adaptive, instead being just a Psychic powerhouse. A weak connection, but one I still think is important. 

**6) The Pokemon Universe and You**
Now, this one is a very long one. This is something of my magnum opus, a theory that combines a hell of a lot of evidence to try to explain the pokemon world in its entirety. Get ready for a long read.

The short argument, or synopsis, if you will: the Pokemon World is actually Earth, but an Earth that has been extremely altered due to a string of bizarre metaphysical and metatemporal events which altered the timeline in a kind of crumpled mess. 

....Just stay with me here.

*Evidence A:* Celebi. With just Celebi, we know that time travel exists. We also know, thanks to a hidden event in HeartGold and SoulSilver, that time travel can alter the basic nature of a pokemon, since a Pichu that time traveled with Celebi loses its ability to Evolve. We could also take the idea that there was time travel technology in Gold and Silver, but seeing as that is never referenced again from that point, I'm content to just assume it was only a way to try to allow trading between the two generations and just leave it at that. We still have Celebi, which travels through time, and knowledge that time travel can alter living creatures.

*Evidence B:* The Real World. There are multiple mentions of real world places throughout the pokemon games, but they are never particularly important, and they always seem to be somewhat... strange. One of Aerodactyl's pokedex entry states:

&gt; Aerodactyl is a Pokémon from the age of dinosaurs. It was regenerated from genetic material extracted from amber. It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times.

Note, that was from Ruby/Sapphire, so this isn't just something from the first generation. We have explicit mention of dinosaurs, and that pokemon existed alongside them. But... how? Unless some kind of time travel was involved, whereby pokemon from the present or future was transplanted into the past (we already know Celebi does this at least sometimes). Yet, pokemon are considered different from the dinosaurs. So, humans know creatures that were not pokemon existed, but they essentially don't exist anymore, except for perhaps small insects or fish or something. Strange, no?

Beyond that, we have references to Africa, China, the Space Shuttle Columbia, and even more. Yet, these references almost always seem to be shrouded in legend, or artifacts from the distant past. Almost as if there are cultural artifacts of these places, but they no longer exist.

*Evidence C:* Egg Groups. Unlike most real world animals, pokemon have quite large numbers of possible sexual partners (assuming they partake in sexual reproduction, which I believe they do). The existence of Egg Groups themselves is bizarre, but they become a little more sensible with a Celebi-corrupted timeline. As pokemon continued to be introduced into the past, further evolutionary relatives of the older pokemon were able to stabilize their own predecessors, allowing for the creation of groups of pokemon which can somehow breed, probably due to some weird genetics (again, back to that pesky Mew...). 

*Evidence D:* The Regions. Now, this in and of itself is a conspiracy all its own, but I am using it as evidence. The idea that the first four regions of the pokemon games key up almost exactly to areas of Japan (as can be seen here: http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ad/Regions.png ). Now, if the areas are almost identical, that seems like a pretty good indicator that they are related in some way, but if so, then where are the cultural remnants? If we take the idea that the pokemon world is a future version of the real world, then where is the old cities, the ancient histories, or any of that? None of it seems to exist. This is why I don't believe in the Future Earth theory. 

""But, but but!"" you say, ""What about those mentions of China and Africa?"" Well, yes, that's interesting, but it only lends credence to my theory. There ARE remnants, but they almost legendary, being things only mentioned occasionally. Hell, entire cultures surrounding pokemon have risen and fallen, left so far behind in the past that the inhabitants of the pokemon world have almost no idea about what they are like (the Ruins of Alph, for instance). Why would Africa and China survive, but not these cultures? 

Maybe there was a bottlenecking event. Or, maybe the timeline got so messed up that Celebi brought some people from the versions of the world which used to exist into the Pokemon World, letting these legends survive, like a reference to Atlantis. 

*Evidence E:* An Image of Earth. Another fun piece of evidence coming from HeartGold and SoulSilver, we have more strange things popping out of hidden events. If you bring Arceus to the Ruins of Alph you can unlock a special event where Cynthia shows up and unlocks a new area of the Ruins that then teleport you to a different set of ruins, the Sinjoh Ruins (see what they did there?). In these ruins Arceus creates an egg for the protagonist, an egg of Palkia, Giratina or Dialga. That alone is cool, and potentially telling, but we have more important things to look at here. When Arceus is performing this miraculous act, a number of images flash on the screen for a split second. One of them is that of the Earth, seen from space. So, we have Arceus invoking the very planet to create life. That seems important.

*Evidence F:* Parallel Universes. This is the thing that really got me thinking when I discovered it. It comes from Gen V, in Opelucid City. For those who don't know, Opelucid City has two different forms, depending on which version of Gen V you play. In Black, Opelucid City is a huge, bustling metropolis of technological marvel that shows off some of the coolest things commercially available in the pokemon world. In White, Opelucid City is a city steeped in traditions, the people there rejecting change.

Cool, right? It's more than just having different pokemon between the two games. At least, that's what it seems like at first. A closer look reveals something much, much stranger. 

There is a man in Opelucid City with a peculiar story. He says that his grandfather created a device that could see through time. The man has been using it to talk to his grandfather or something like that, but he also has become aware of something bizarre. His grandfather apparently can see two different versions of the future: one in which the city is all technological, and one in which the future is very much like the past. This man wants a pokemon that can use the move Spark to power his machine and try to connect to that other version of the world, but here's the kicker: he needs a pokemon *from the other universe.* In other words, the different versions of the games? They aren't just a gimmick. They have now been confirmed to be parallel versions of the same universe, where things are slightly different. And, somehow, Silph Co. and Devon Corp., and who knows who else, have developed technology to allow the different universes to meet. I mean, you can trade between games, and this guy in Opelucid City has made it quite clear that there *are* differences between the pokemon that come from different universes. 

So, does that mean that when you are trading with another person, or battling them, that the space the two of you are teleported to in the Pokecenter is somewhere between the universes? Is it a kind of void space, or a conjoined space, or what? I have no idea, but apparently the multiworld theory is real in the pokemon universe.

In conclusion, the Pokemon World seems to be a version of the real world corrupted by time traveling Celebi (and possibly time traveling humans, if some random old guy can make a device to see through time in his house). More, the different versions of the games are all parallel universes of the same world, meaning that while the games build on each other, they might not all build on each other in the same way. There might be separate timelines involved.

He goes to the S.S. Anne and talks with the Captain only to find a sick old man and realizes it was a waste of time. He loses to Red, and Raticate dies. So Blue goes to the gym in fury and defeats Lt. Surge. Blue plants the tree do deter Red from continuing his journey, which would explain the tree outside of Cerulean and the trainers just chilling there on the other side not realizing they cannot return to Cerulean.

HM02 is received from the female celebrity in the house behind the Bike Path. She is clearly trying to hide from someone who found her before (Blue? He never technically uses HM02 unless he has another flying type slave we don't know about) and gives you it with a promise to never tell anyone where she is.

HM03 is found in the Safari Zone where you must find the house in the back. Why hide it way in the back? How did the Warden ""lose"" his teeth? Blue bullied the Warden, and received both HM03 and HM04 from him, all the while stealing his teeth and hiding the teeth deep in the Safari Zone so Red will never be able to reach Cinnabar.

HM05 is received by catching 10 different types of Pokemon. We know Blue has caught that many. Why is the aide on the other side of Diglett's Cave? Blue threatened him into hiding. 

The Snorlaxs are a different beast. I could come up with something just to come up with something but I don't want to.

1372197497.0,118,self.pokemonconspiracies,1h2en2,Why can't Nidorina or Nidoqueen breed? I have a theory.,153,35,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1h2en2/why_cant_nidorina_or_nidoqueen_breed_i_have_a/,"This is a list of Generation I Pokemon in the Undiscovered Egg Group:

* Nidorina
* Nidoqueen
* Articuno
* Zapdos
* Moltres
* Mew
* Mewtwo

We can reduce this list further since we know Mewtwo came from Mew and Nidoqueen evolves from Nidorina:

* Nidorina
* Articuno
* Zapdos
* Moltres
* Mew

This leaves us with Mew, the 3 Legendary Birds, and Nidorina as the only Pokemon lines that cannot breed in Gen I. Even in later generations, all the Pokemon who belong to this Egg Group are legendary and *not ordinary* in any way.

Now, we also have some interesting facts about Nidorina:

&gt;Nidorina is comparatively larger than her pre-evolution, **though she loses the forehead horn, whiskers, and incisor teeth.** She remains quadruped. Nidorina is also turquoise in coloration instead of bluish lavender, with a pale underside. Nidorina's poison spikes are larger and probably more potent; **she has also gained the ability to stand on her hind legs.**

Isn't it strange that Nidoran F would lose its horn after evolving into Nidorina only to regain it after evolving into Nidoqueen? And whereas Nidorino is strictly quadrupedal, Nidorina is somewhat bipedal?

My theory?

Nidorina is an ancient Pokemon, if not the true child of Mew. Nidorina then evolved into two separate lines, Nidoqueen, and some other ancestral Pokemon which gave rise to the Monster Egg Group:

* Cubone → Marowak
* Lickitung
* Kangaskhan
* Snorlax
* Monster/Grass (Bulbasaur's line)
* Monster/Dragon (Charmander's line)
* Monster/Water 1 (Squirtle's line + Slowpoke's line + Lapras)
* Monster/Field (Nidoran F + Nidoran M's line + Rhyhorn's line)

This ancestral Monster Pokemon would have **not** had a horn. It would have resembled a smaller version of Nidorina. In fact I think it would have looked like the Substitute doll: 

http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412piKhx5EL._SY300_.jpg

Which may have been the direct ancestor of Kangaskhan, Cubone, Snorlax. The Kanto starters might also be adaptations of this Pokemon, and Slowpoke, Squritle, and Lapras are obviously related somehow.

Notice how, with the exception of Lapras, none of these Pokemon have horns, making a strong case for direct descent from Nidorina, parallel to Nidoqueen. Lapras' horn is a later aquatic adaptation, not a poison point.

However, one group does have horns: Monster/Field, the Nidoran and Rhyhorn families. ALL the Pokemon in this group have horns, and they are distinct, iconic characteristics of these Pokemon.

Basically, Nidoran (M and F) came from Nidorina. Nidoran was originally a single species of Pokemon, known for its horn, but only the male could evolve, as only the males were needed to protect the pack.

During the Kanto War, the thirst for ultra-powerful Pokemon led to many attempts to create female Nidoking in order to utilize the full capabilities of the species, and thousands of female Nidorans were genetically modified beyond repair.

The female Nidorans were forced to revert back into sterile Nidorinas and evolve into sterile Nidoqueens.

The real female Nidorans became extinct due to natural selection, and this genetically modified Nidoran became classified as a different species, Nidoran F.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1h2en2,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1h2en2/why_cant_nidorina_or_nidoqueen_breed_i_have_a/,

Magikarp
I find this one a little boring to be honest, and the evolution, that's a tough one, its the only reason I didn't post until now...

**Reproduction:**  ""Magikarp are extremely plentiful, living in almost any region. No one really knows how this Pokémon survived..."" (Bulbapedia).  Magikarp breeds in the same way as a carp, reproducing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of eggs a season.  Magikarp survive through sheer numbers.
To reproduce a male (or many males) swim along beside a female Magikarp, fertilizing her eggs, as they grow on the outside of her body.  Once her eggs have been fertilized she releases them into the sediment at the bottom of a river.  Close to 95% of the eggs hatch (as opposed to the ~80% for carp), and develop into full grown Magikarp, clogging rivers once they hatch.

**Growth:** Once the Magikarp has hatched they are still attached to the yolk of their egg, and use this for nourishment.  The Magikarp grows very quickly, and loses the yolk within a few days, reaching full size after just a couple weeks.  Magikarp reaches a size of 0.9m and 10.0kg.

**Nutrition:** Just like other pokemon, Magikarp is omnivorous, eating both plants and animals. In times of food shortage, Magikarp have been known to eat their own eggs and larva in a brutal display of uncharacteristic violence.

**Moveset:**

* Splash: Splash is a young Magikarp's only ""attack"".  In theory it is believed it is a desperate attempt to end a depressingly sad life.  Most Magikarp's never evolve into a Gyrados, and never find a loving trainer. Magikarp develops no meaningful purpose in life and often tries to end it. Magikarp ""splash"" to try to attract predators.  This truly is a pathetic pokemon.

* Tackle: The few Magikarp that reach level 15 have lived long enough that their scales have hardened significantly and they may now throw themselves at opponents, dealing minimal damage.

* Flail: At this point, the Magikarp has lived long enough that it now holds onto life in the hopes that one day, it will become a Gyrados.  This hope has given it a reason to live, so once it's life is put in jeopardy it attempts to defend itself to the best of its abilities. This is why damage increases as Magikarp's health goes down.

**Evolution:**
Magikarp clearly undergoes some kind of huge metamorphosis when he evolves. But how does this little fish, turn into such a big sea serpent?  Unfortunately, we don't know for sure.  The metamorphosis has never been observed directly, due to the fact that it takes place at extremely deep depths (I mean those deep waters on the other side of the rock walls in the ocean).  The current theory states that one piece of the puzzle is missing, that Magikarp actually has an evolution before Gyrados. It is uncertain what this secondary evolution is. Perhaps it is a chrysallis, similar to Kakuna, or Metapod.  Or perhaps it is some larger intermediate fish.  Until we are able to dive down to such low depths, we will not no for sure how Magikarp evolves.

**Abilities**

* Swift Swim: Magikarp gets slippery when wet, boosting his speed.  I don't think this needs much explaination.

* Rattled: Magikarp may have a deathwish, however, there are three things they are scared of. The dark, bugs, and ghosts (aren't we all). Thus, when attacked by these types of pokemon, Magikarp will run in terror, effectively increasing their speed.

Aerodactyl is a Prehistoric form of a Charizard. The two pokemon look similar [charizard pic](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/7/7e/006Charizard.png/230px-006Charizard.png), [aerodactyl pic](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/e/e8/142Aerodactyl.png/220px-142Aerodactyl.png).

This is a theory I came up with in about one second as I saw a pic of what looked like a ""grey Charizard."" Feel free to poke holes in it. Someone mentioned this is very similar to Charizard's shiny sprite. (I totally wish I included this at the time. I didn't remember about this until after I logged off Reddit. Thanks for the user who said this.)

This could be possible because Aerodactyl is a fossil pokemon (yeah no kidding...) but in general:
*they do have similar wing structure, the nubs on Charizard's wings could be whats left of Aerodactyl's hands.
*the eyes are almost identical.

So yeah. Feel free to disagree or agree with me. Like I said, thought this up quick so, let the discussion commence.

**EDIT:** so everyone's been commenting on aerodactyl's lack of arms. It's become overdone. There's about 3 or 4 of the same post ""oh aerodactyl doesn't have arms."" Yes. Thank you. I ask that people try to stay away from the same thing over and over again. Thanks. For those of you who prefer the Zubat - Aerodactyl theory [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/y41ax/aerodactyl_is_charizard_prehistoric_form/c5s61kx).

Here you [go](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/y41ax/aerodactyl_is_charizard_prehistoric_form/c5s6xco).

There's a great theory in here. It states how Charizard, Aerodactyl, and even now Marowak are all related. Worth the read, IMO. This was the thread about the Shiny Charizard.

He can't remember his long time neighbour's name either, or even if that neighbour is a boy or girl or not, even when the neighbour is directly in front of him. Oak would believe you if you said his grandson's name is DickMunch.

Another point is the Pokedex. He asked you to fill it with information on Pokemon, right? For research? Okay, with the technology present in the Pokemon universe, such as resurecting fossilized pokemon, or time machines, they should know pretty much all there is about Pokemon. I mean, where would the info in the Pokedex come from? It's all ready in there: it just needs to be unlocked with the sight or capture of the Pokemon needed. Oak gives you a task that is completely useless, him thinking it is real research, and that most information on Pokemon is missing.

My third point is that he mainly helps you throughout the game, not Blue, his grandson.  He thinks that you, Red, are his grandson. Oak's just confused, that's all. Another symptom of being senile.

Look close at the parallels.  Ears at the same place, just blown out, arms come out at the same place, even with much the same breakage.  However, with Garbodor, the trash bag portion looks like it's in tatters, just like with a real trash bag when you try and fill it with too much stuff and the bottom gives out.  Here is my theory:  Trubbish is placed into a garbage bag when it is a baby, possibly due to a weak immune system.  They give it holes for its arms, eyes, and mouth, but the ears and feet simply push against the edges of the bag.  As it grows, it keeps pushing at the boundaries of the bag.  Its face stays basically the same, but its ears grow and eventually burst out of the bag like a can of rolls after being heated.  Its body bursts through the bottom of the bag at roughly the same time, using the weakness of the holes in the arms as the breaking point.  In this way, they are like hermit crabs, except that they do not look for a new home when they get bigger; they simply don't need that much protection anymore.

**TL;DR: Trubbish is not a trashbag.  It's *wearing* one.**

EDIT:  On the subject of Grimer.  I disagree that Trubbish is Grimer, because I don't think there's enough evidence to support it.  Yes, they have similar ideas behind them, but the coloring is different, Trubbish is solid, it has arms but no fingers, feet, and most importantly *teeth*, evolves sooner, has all of 3 moves in common in its learnset, changes weight in evolution where Grimer doesn't, and so on.

Pokemon labs were created to study Pokemon. But in order to study Pokemon they would have to capture them, lots of them. So Pokemon labs came up with the trainer program in order to acquire a lot of Pokemon. They would allow trainers to register with their local Pokemon lab. Registering allowed trainers to store Pokemon in Pokemon labs via the PC system and take on the newly formed Pokemon League challenge.

Eventually, as one would assume Pokemon labs received more trainers then they needed. They cut back registration on trainers to children from the town the Pokemon lab was located in, and to make it fair opened up the Pokemon League to everyone who had a Pokemon.

Registered trainers were given 1 of 3 rare Pokemon, which varied by region. We learned from the Anime that most trainers didn't last over a year, and I imagine they didn't catch over then 40 Pokemon in that time. So each lab had roughly 80-120 Pokemon at a time. The trainer who ended their journey would be allowed to keep as many Pokemon as they wanted and the rest would either become possession of the lab, or released to the wild. In some cases the Safari Zone Warden would buy left over Pokemon from the Pokemon labs to populate the Safari Zone.

The gyms served as a challenge to encourage the registered trainers to seek out more powerful and rare Pokemon. This is why Pewter City Gym has very low level Pokemon and Viridian City has very high level Pokemon. It's supposed to get incrementally more difficult as the trainer moves through the circuit so they are forced to train and catch new Pokemon. The Pokemon League Finals seves as a fund raiser for the Pokemon labs and trainer program. The money generated at the Pokemon League funds the Pokemon labs and all their endeavors (gyms, trainers, etc).",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_11ix68,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11ix68/purpose_of_pokemon_labs/,

The facts:

1. Memento makes the user faint, somehow depressing the opponent.

It is a sealed community where the mentally insane can live freely and make their own decisions without the constraints of the “real world” and its pressures; this is why you technically cannot leave the boundaries of the “reservation.” Houses can be as small, empty, and unorthodoxly laid out as they wish because the people there do not specifically have a standard of living. This is also why people seem to never make any progress on what they are doing as you play through the game. Because of the wide range of and complex mental illnesses, all the trainers and people live in their own (mental) world. This is why much of their babbling to you (before a battle, after, inside their home) is very strange. Which proves why some of the weakest trainers think they are superior and have the best, most rare Pokémon (Rattata). Furthermore, this is exactly why the majority of people you talk to say the exact same things over and over again; they are just babbling psychos. Mothers who think their kids are off doing something, and old people with dementia looking out the window at some island that will (most likely) never come. This is also why the story feels so “young” to us. It is because (some) people’s minds have never grown or matured so they communicate like 10 year olds.  Again, this is why there are no cars or other self means of transportation (other than: foot, bike, Pokémon) (Ignore PKM B&amp;W for the cars statement)


The Poke Marts and Poke Centers and other misc. buildings are managed by the staff to make sure things are in order and people (and Pokémon) can get the proper (medical or other) attention that is desired.

  
The professors are all senile (this theory has been around for a while) and this is why they will give anyone; even 10 year olds, jobs that more mature people should handle.

 
Your mother lost her mind from the tragedy of your father. That is why she locks herself in her house. (except for when she gives you the running shoes in 3rd gen)


I would like to think that the Pokémon creatures are still caught and trained outside of the Psychiatric retreat  but in “here” they are heavily regulated. That is why there is a ton more “safe” ones (Zubat, Pidgey, Bidoof) a player can find rather than harmful/more powerful ones. Which also brings the point to the “rarity” of the legendries….maybe they are common outside of the contained zone and that is why you can still catch repeat legendries in other games.


This is just a beginning of the insight to the crazies in the locked away area. Feel free to be critical or add on.


EDIT: Adding more: More games and new areas or ""reservations"" keep coming out because the population in the specific ""regions"" are growing and over populating. This is why all the regions are beginning to link together and you can walk from Kanto to Johto. They are simply just adding on to the original site.

Also, ""finding"" all-new 100+ Pokemon at one time in a region that is literally 20 steps away is a bit farfetched for this worlds technology. So the board of trustees who run the reserve make big announcements to newly discovered land and Pokemon to keep the new and old population interested. Even though those Pokemon breeds have been inhabiting the outside world for generations. Though it may not matter to the admitted patiences since they are all psycho, it gives us and them something new to do...... and I bet helps the company who runs it make more profit.

Someone mentioned the story behind the evil teams and if there was a ""creative"" insight to them. I would have to say that the leader is just some forcefully verbal patient that is very obsessive and controlling so they take it upon themselves to recruit others to join their cause.....basically using the peoples weaknesses to his or her advantage. Remember, not all people inside a psych ward...or reservation for this theory.... are babbling psychos who cannot function. There are some people (10%) who act normal but are absolutely insane. Which I would account for some of the personalities you have deeper rapport with throughout the story.

This incident is why Mr. Fuji runs into the tower to confront the grunts and is taken captive. The player travels up the tower, battles possessed channelers, and is confronted by the mother Marowak just before entering the tower top. Players defeat the Marowak, the grunts, Fuji thanks you, and together travel down the tower to his house. This, along with fame checker and townsfolk’s opinion all makes Fuji’s character appear good. However, the entire event is a façade. The pokemon tower is not for paying respects, Fuji is helping the grunts, and the possessed Channelers and Marowak are holding Fuji and the grunts hostage.
 
The Pokemon shrine in Lavender town is a ‘straw man’ shrine assembled to appease survivors who want to pay respect to the dead, and a front to store the pokemon killed by team rocket. If the tower held any significance for the townspeople or Fuji, then the shrine would not be converted into the radio-tower present in Gen 2. Prior to entering Lavender town in G1, players already encountered team rocket members selling slowpoke tail and have encountered the Rocket game corner. This shows Team rocket does mangle and kill pokemon, and has a public front through which they do business. The Rocket group needs a discreet spot to put dead pokemon bodies, and the pokemon shrine, a place for DEAD pokemon, is the perfect place. Fuji’s job in Lavender town is to divert public attention from Rocket’s business.

Players entering Lavender town hear team rocket killed a cubone’s mother in the town square, and is a source of resentment throughout the citizens.  Fuji’s team rocket PR job is on damage control. Fuji's first move is to aid the grunts by removing the body from the town center and into the pokemon tower. However, when the Grunts and Fuji reach the top of the tower, the enraged Marowak’s spirit keeps the group from leaving. The raging spirits of pokemon killed by team rocket and the poisons possess the channelers to prevent any interference in holding Fuji and Grunts hostage.

The spirits are successful until you, the player, barge through the tower defeating the opposition, thereby saving the rocket grunts, Fuji, and the entire cover up.

We've seen some animals in the anime before and we've also heard of them in the anime/game pokedex. We can for sure say they exist in the Pokemon world. Yet you wouldn't be able to throw a Pokeball at a cow and capture it, or train one to use Fire Blast. Why is this?

I believe it may be because of the space virus in which Deoxys was mutated from. My theory is that long ago before humans, mammals or pokemon of any kind, the virus was thriving on a distant world far from Earth. Small groups of the virus occasionally transported throughout the Universe on meteorites, some of which landed on Earth. The virus could not survive within Earth's atmosphere, so the virus began looking for a way to survive; it fused with whatever living thing was around it. (Plants and dinosaurs) 

Many ancient pokemon and dinosaurs were then wiped out by the larger meteors/volcanos/whatever the theories are behind the mass extinction of dinosaurs, which suggests why pokemon like Aerodactyl are only found in fossils. Over the many years as life jumped out of the distaster, meteorites carrying the virus kept coming in rare intervals, infecting anything living to guarantee its survival.

This could also explain why more and more pokemon are being discovered; the virus keeps coming. Also, the diversity in which Deoxys can change its form may be a clue as to why Pokemons stats are so different. The virus may simply modify a specific stat to enhance its hosts survivability.

We can catch Pokemon because the Pokeballs are able to recognize the virus, and anything carrying it will pretty much be able to be converted into a transferable matter. (Whatever that red beam in the Pokeballs is)

However, each stage in its evolution represents a different phase of life for basically any computer technology.

The original Porygon is like old, outdated tech. Its blocky appearance is reminiscent of old school computer graphics. It looks like a 3D model with a very low polygon count, similar to those you'd see when 3D rendering engines were first introduced. It has pretty poor stats as well, and is almost unusable by today's standards.

Porygon2 is like the new technology on the block. It's received a substantial boost, both in appearance and power. Visually, its body is reminiscent of the old school Porygon, but its edges are totally smooth and much more similar to graphics you'd see in current rendering engines. It evolves via the Up-Grade, a disc released by Silph Co., a company known for their technological advances. From a statistical perspective, every one of Porygon2's stats is higher than Porygon's by exactly 20, indicating better performance across the board.

Porygon-Z is like current technology that has been exploited and is infected with a virus. It's total stats are slightly higher than Porygon2's, but the distribution is totally out of whack. Its defensive stats are lower and its speed and special attack are both higher, possibly indicating that a security breach has occurred in its programming. Its appearance shares a number of ""body parts"" that you see in Porygon2, except they all have a much more chaotic appearance. In order to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z, you need the Dubious Disc, a disc whose origins and purpose are totally unknown. Plus, Porygon-Z can be seen as a corruption of the name Porygon2, since the Z is like a corruption of the number 2.

When the project bore no real fruit for the amount of money it cost, Giovani shut it down and the Pokemon were released.

It's time to get out the party hats and the alcoholic beverages because we just reached 10000! I'm now going to proceed with thank-yous and emotional rambling. 

Digrish and I made this subreddit (His account, my laptop) when one night he slept over at my house. We were on reddit and Diggy asked if I had heard of the various conspiracies that existed on the internet about pokemon. I hadn't, and that's how we spent the night. That morning Diggy came up with the idea of making a subreddit about it, and that's how we spent the morning. 

We reached about 18 subs in a day, with which we were delighted. We reached 50 within days and decided to hire a 3rd mod to handle all the subs (yes, 50 was a lot to us then). That's how ghax was born. When someone made a post in r/pokemon about a conspiracy and Diggy commented to advertise our subreddit, it reached top comment. We got 2000 subs in 4 days. Daly was born around this time. Lunar did our CSS, which was appalling up until then because neither of us know anything about it. 

We had a few spikes in growth for various reasons, we had some hiccups, and after everything I find myself rubbing my eyes and looking at the laptop screen. 

I have to thank all the mods, especially ghax, without whom we would not be where we are today. Ghax (pokemonconspiracies is his new username) is genuinely the greatest mod anyone could have asked for, and is also omnipresent, so you know win-win. I'd like to thank all 10061 of you, and everyone whose ever posted or commented or read anything here. It means the world to me. 

But this subreddit has outgrown our mod brains. When we set it up, all we wanted was a subreddit where people could have an interesting pokemon discussion and look at the games/anime/manga in a different light afterwards. This is everything we had ever wanted to be and more. This is the greatest subreddit out there. People have tried to be more like r/pokemonconspiracies. People have tried to be more like all of you. So really I just wanted to say, thank you. Thanks for being here, thanks for talking, and finally thanks for allowing me to be a part of one of the greatest expriences I've ever had.

In Generation I, it was feasible to believe regular animals to exist alongside Pokemon, which could still make humans evolving the same way they did in our world a viable theory.

However, as time went on, new revelations came about: Powerful Pokemon created the land and sea, references to real world animals vanished and it was revealed a Pokemon was responsible for the creation of the world. A Pokemon creating the world easily explains the world being populated by Pokemon, but it doesn't explain how humans came to be.

Humans are completely different life forms than Pokemon. They don't 'evolve' in the same way Pokemon do. They certainly cannot breed with them (squick). They cannot learn elemental attacks. On top of that, there are no Pokemon species that would serve as logical relatives or ancestors of humans. 

So if we accept that humans are completely different life forms, we must ask how they came into being? It would seem they didn't evolve from Pokemon, so perhaps Arceus created them, but even that seems strange because why would this being create these life forms completely different than the ones derived from Him?

So here is my theory: Humans came to be in a separate reality from Pokemon. The idea is that Arceus brought humans into the realm of Pokemon from another dimension. Perhaps this dimension was dying and the Alpha Pokemon protected these humans by giving them a place in His world.

Another bit of evidence I'd like to use in support of this claim, aside from the already-pointed-out differences between humans and Pokemon, is the Sinnoh Library in Canalave City. One of the books stated that Pokemon and humans lived separate lives long ago. Perhaps this is because humans were new arrivals to this world and had yet to develop the relationship they would enjoy years later?

Or that is the assumption; but what if capturing pokemon IS a manifestation of a trainer's power?

This could work out many ways, and it all ties into the ability of a trainer to capture Pokemon, which is a special skill of Pokemon trainers. Pokemon that are captured submit to the trainer's will within seconds of being captured (barring high-level outsiders). If being captured is not strictly a mechanical process of the pokeball, but also a manifestation of a Trainer's power over the wills of Pokemon, then that means that weak trainers will have fewer Pokemon, and stronger trainers can have many. This is why Derptrainer Herpy only has 2 pokemon, but you can have as many as you want, and it is fair.

To access one region from another is by the magnet train (I'll get to that later) or thought the Indigo Plateau entrance. Going through the Indigo Plateau is like going through customs. The guards check your bag for illegal items and so forth. Because of the war, (yes I know war theories are banned, but it neatly ties in with mine) only certain people are allowed to pass between them: Oak, Elm, gym leaders, Elite 4 members, Red, and of course you. However they aren't very strict with this, passes can be acquired by filling out an application, but the hard feelings between the two places prevents anyone who remembers the war too stubborn to visit the other region. Now for the magnet train, no one really uses it because of hard feelings. The player either doesn't care about the war or is too young to remember. 

Now that I'm seriously off track, here is the answer. You can't fly because it is illegal to do so because you are bypassing customs. As for the train, you go through customs before boarding. 

That's my theory, hoped you liked it.

Edit: Someone has pointed out that there is place that allows to fly between both regions. I meant to put this in my original theory but forgot. Basically, in the Pokemon League (the only place where you can do this) you've gone through customs in both regions. Also, as some theories have said that the game only shows the highlights of your journey (i.e. no bathroom breaks, eating, etc.) This also means that when you talk to someone, you just get the gist of what they are saying. Again, my train of thought has seriously been derailed. So, it doesn't show you having to go through customs or even interacting with the guards.

Now, I can't find the tree that describes all the legendaries, with their specific abilities and all, but this will do for now: http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/195/d/c/legendary_pokemon_family_tree_by_Maddygirl13.png

We know Arceus created the world as we know it, being the ""God"" of all the Pokemon, and, in a way, humans too(more on that later). Arceus created Dialga and Palkia, the beings of time and space. The third of the trio, Giratina, was banished to the Distortion World, where Chaos (Giratina) rules. Like Tyler185 said with his post (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16i4zb/all_the_cute_legendaries_are_fail_safes_against/), all other smaller legendaries have fail safes, or fall backs in case of a rampage. Celebi, as stated before, was a failsafe for Dialga: The being of time can be controlled by the time traveler itself. Palkia's fail safe is Jirachi, due to the power it contains: Space Lord can be put down, if needed, by the being from Sapce itself. The Lake trio, as the games have shown, are the fail safe for Giratina. Team Plasma could only access Giratina with all three of them (a really decent fail safe if you think about it).

So Arceus created the world, with Dialga and Palkia controlling space and time. Mew is of being Mew, creating other Pokemon (more later). Arcues, knowing Mew needs a place to put the things it creates, created Kyogre and Groudon, being of super-extreme power of land and water. Unfortunately, we saw in the games how they really don't get along when they meet. Arceus is forced to make Rayquaza, a fail safe for the two of them. Or is it? Kyogre, mentioned in the other theory has another fail safe: Manaphy. But what about Groudon? It might be strange, but Regigigas actually might be the fail safe for it. Think about it: it can control the continents, which Groudon can create. Even though there's no ""way"" to subdue Groudon, Gigas just has to keep sinking the land Groudon creates.

The planet is made, and world is slowly being populated with Mew from all the Pokemon it makes. This includes Man. Man can be considered formed from Mew, given several Pokemon (Mr. Mime, Jynx to just name two) that have human like characteristics. Shaymin is made to help bring life to areas, thus helping Mew even more. Arceus aids in this two, and, to prevent the continents from moving more, puts Gigas in a deep sleep. It gives Man the ""power"" to re-awaken Gigas, in the forms of the Regis. However, Man hasn't been around for that long, and locks up the Regis, fearing them (like the games describe). Man continues to build up their structures, advancing in many fields. They begin to capture, and train Pokemon. Some use it for personal gain, others use it as pets. Arceus keeps watching, just in case it is needed.

And turns out, it is needed. Man gets too powerful. What we know as the Pokemon War starts (how, we don't know). During the fighting, Arceus creates Ho-oh, and Lugia, each with the power to cripple Man's technologies, so that the war may end. But, in the process, Ho-oh destroys some of the civilian things, including the Burned Tower in Ecruteak. There were 3 Pokemon inside that tower, according to legend: Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Ho-oh realizes the mistake in killing the Pokemon, and gives them powers they couldn't access before, turning them into the legendary beast trio. They stay, however, in the tower, waiting for the right trainer to awaken them.

The war is still raging. Lugia uses its power to create the bird trio, which remove the forces of Man from 3 key areas in Kanto: The Power Plant, Victory Road, and the Seafoam Islands. Once Man was removed from the areas, the birds stayed, in case men wanted to regain the areas. Finally, the war ends, but we are not sure of how that occurs either. My theory is that Meloetta, after being created by Arceus, used its song to calm the people. It was such an amazing song, and such power was put behind it that it lost its voice. The world begins to rebuild, and almost all the legendaries ""disappear"", only spoken of by rumors, and wild stories.

Then, a boy is born. He begins his journey, and eventually becomes the greatest Trainer ever. Arceus is aware that Red is the strongest ever, and creates Victini, a Pokemon of immense power. Red waits on Mt. Silver, waiting for the trainer to oppose him. If Red wins, Victini will unleash its power on Red, making sure trainers would never get as strong as Red again. But Gold wins, and Victini doesn't have to use its power.

So, I know I missed a lot of legendaries, but I tried on very little sleep to put this all together. One point I need to mention at the end is what about Arceus? Arceus is God over everything; shouldn't it have a fail safe, and how does Arceus's fail safe fit into the world, if it exists? It's the Unown. Arceus gave Man lots of things: this included an alphabet based from the Unown. So, the Unown had to have been in existence back when Mew was creating Pokemon, right? Yes, but Arceus itself created the Unown. We saw in the 3rd Pokemon movie what a ton of Unown can do, power-wise. If Arceus ever ""got out of hand"", the Unown could subdue it. This now raises the question which is more powerful: God, or its Creation?

TL;DR: Arceus creates legendaries based on the things needed at the time. As precautions, Arceus, along with Mew, created fail safes for the legendaries, that could subdue them when the time was needed. Mew creates Man from Pokemon, and Man get the power to harness Pokemon. Pokemon War starts, Meleotta ends it. Red is born, gets super-powerful, Victini is created to prevent Red from ruling the world with his power. Arceus's fail safe is the Unown.

On one hand, we know that Mew is the ""ancestor of all pokemon,"" and  (like Ditto...) contains the DNA of every other Pokemon, and can thereby transform into other Pokemon and use their moves.  On the other, we have Arcaeus, who like a monotheistic god, invented time, space, and other dimensions; it also presumably also created all Pokemon.

So, Mew and Arcaeus compete for 1st place in the Pokemon origin narrative. What are the ramifications of one beast coming before the other?

If Mew came first, then Arcaeus and its brethren are simply ultra-powerful beings that evolved into states higher than humans can understand. Humans, particularly those in Japan, thereby invented myths and venerated the Pokemon as kamis.

If Arcaeus came first, why would it bother to create a Mew? Arcaeus appears to have powers to create beings by itself. In fact, Arceus in this model necessarily had to create Palkia, Dialga and Giratina (and probably others) before Mew. So what does Mew do? If Mew was invented only to propagate lesser Poke-life, then why does it contain the essence of the legendary pokemon?

I'm sure there's a lot of counter arguements to this, but i'd like to hear some feedback.

So, it all starts in Lavender Town. Your rival is just randomly there. The most popular reason is that his Raticate died, but what if he was there trying to guard Team Rocket? He was there for a while, so it's safe to assume that he SAW Team Rocket pass by. There would be no reason for him to NOT attack Team Rocket.

Next, you see him again in Saffron City, in the Silph Co. Right before you go to fight Giovanni, your rival is once again to be found. Once you beat him, he says something along the lines of ""Maybe now you're ready for boss rocket!"" Now hold on. What was stopping HIM from fighting Giovanni? His team could easily beat Giovanni's, but he just leaves. That's odd. 

Then, he becomes the champion. When you beat him, he says ""My reign is over already!"" I don't remember the anime or the games saying that the champion can rule over others like a leader. The only thing i can think of is that he was going to call in Team Rocket reinforcements to help him secure control of Kanto, but he was unable to because of the speed in which you beat him.

Fast forward three years, into G/S/C/HG/SS. You find Blue (your rival in the first games) is sitting on the charred remains of Cinnabar island. He says that the island was destroyed because of an active volcano. But wait... there is no Volcano on Cinnabar in the Anime OR the games. Gold wouldn't know that because he is native to Johto, not Kanto, making Blue more believable. The only thing i can think of is that he used some kind of Rocket Bomb to blow up Cinnabar. Blue is also the leader of Giovanni's old gym.

This is all i can think of for now. Be sure to let me know if there's any problems with this theory. All feedback is helpful.

Edit: Well, the comments say that the Volcano thing is BS. That's what i get for not watching the anime for years. But something else was pointed out that adds on even more evidence.

When you fight Gary for the third time, he comes from the North of Nugget Bridge, which is where the secret Team Rocket agent was recruiting. And there's also the matter of how he got onto the S.S Anne. Gary ""claims"" that he got the ticket from Bill, but Bill was turned into a Pokemon when you were there. And he also never mentioned that he had more than one ticket.

1372094073.0,95,self.pokemonconspiracies,1gz978,There is no limit to the number of Pokemon you can carry,122,27,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1gz978/there_is_no_limit_to_the_number_of_pokemon_you/,"TLDR: People only carry with them the number of pokemon they can care for and manage at a time, this is less than six for some. Ash sucks at battling but is good at training. Gary is still better than everyone. 

I don't think there are specific League rules or anything that limit the number of Pokemon a trainer can carry with them. Rather I think the limit is set by an individual's ability to care for and manage animals, some less domesticated than others. 

Using a real world analogy, there aren't laws that stop you from owning six puppies at a time, and puppies are good, so more puppies should be even better! but then why doesn't everyone have homes flooded with pets? its becauses trying to take care of , much less control, multiple rambunctious animals at a time is difficult and a hassle.  This is why most families only keep one or two pets. This is also why different trainers keep different amounts of pokemon.

Nothing is stopping youngster joey from rolling the elite four with 100 top percentile rodents, except for the fact that a young child is not responsible enough to care for and control so many roided up rats. Otherwise , why wouldn't bug catchers stock pile caterpies? They aren't hard to catch, except for some trainers, they may be. This is somewhat supported in HG/SS, when they speak about dragon taming as if it were some special ability, that not every trainer can manage to handle powerful dragon type pokemon. This would indicate that a person's temperament is an important factor in determining what kinds and possibly how many pokemon some one could train. The limit in game of six pokemon might just represent the main characters own limitations, they had to set the boundary somewhere and its set as equal to the elite four to show that he is far more skilled in training than the average, but sit provides balance so you cant overpower the four with as many as you like. 

As a side note i think this theory may give some redemption to Ash. Its pretty well known that Ash is terrible at battling pokemon, but, what about his skill at training them? Ash has shown to be excellent at befriending and capturing pokemon, even getting along with powerful legendary forces in the movies. He constantly walks around with a large possey of pokemon often kept outside of their pokeballs. Another criticism is He also does not evolve his pokemon often but this could be either to respecting the pokemon's choice (pikachu) which shows a valuable empathy trait, or he is wise enough to recognize his own personal limits. Ash may realize he wouldn't be able to handle all his pokemon in ultramegapower mode, remember what happened when he started evolving charmander? 

I do believe there were rules in the anime however, at least for official league battles, but this theory could still explain why some trainers choose to use less than six pokemon at a time. 

Edit: PartyPoison98 has confirmed that for the anime there are rules capping the number of pokemon you can carry to 6.

How does Gastly enter into all this though? Check his Pokedex entry: ""Born from gases, anyone would faint if engulfed by its gaseous body, which contains poison.""

**EDIT: EVERYONE PLEASE LOOK AT THE TREE AND LOOK AT GIOVANNI AND AGATHA'S FACIAL STRUCTURE**

*From here on out Red will be referred to as ""you""*

**ORIGINAL THEORY ON GIOVANNI BEING RED'S FATHER**
**GIOVANNI HAS NO IDEA/THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE HIS SON THROUGHOUT THIS**

* You don't know who your dad is. He's out training (Red's mother tells him that, if I remember correctly). Couldn't it be possible that Giovanni is this ""trainer""? Maybe Red's mom didn't have a good relationship with Giovanni (one-night thing) or cut off all ties with him after finding out what he does for a living, but she shields you from the idea that you are related to Giovanni.

* Professor Oak does know that you're related to Giovanni, and that is why he is always helping you out and telling you what to do and what not to do. He knows you're not a bully like his grandson Blue, and that is what attracts him to you. He could spend time with his grandson, telling him what is right and what is wrong and helping him become more like you, but he is instead trying to deal harm to Team Rocket by making their leaders' own son not join the legion, having red call it an evil thing. If you knew you the son of the Team Rocket leader and you were the same bully Blue is, **Team Rocket could be much more powerful, and Oak knows that.** An idea to waste your time so you don't ever get bored and think of joining Team Rocket, he gives you quests to catch all the pokemon in the region, collect all the badges, and beat the elite four. You would be too busy for Team Rocket if you did all this.  *Professor Oak has been more of a father to you than your own father*

* Giovanni desperately wants to see his son (this is more of an idea then a theory). He doesn't know that you are his son. When you beat him and receive the Earth Badge, he thinks about what he did and why he did it and decides to disband Team Rocket right there. He decides to go out finish his ""training"" so he can one day go back to see his son, hoping that your mother will eventually take him back and let him see his son.

**SIDE THEORY-Is Agatha Blue's Grandma and Lance's Mother?**

* Agatha and Gary Oak had a ""thing"" many many years ago when they were young. Could it be possible that they had a fling and Lance was their kid? **Possibly.** After having Lance, Agatha kept him away from Oak as much as possible. She didn't like how Oak ""got soft"" (lol sex joke) after his birth and didn't want Lance to turn into the kind of person who befriends their pokemon and loves them like Red is taught to do by Oak-she makes sure that Lance is demanding and makes sure that he doesn't care about a mutual friendship between him and his pokemon. Lance teaches the same thing to his son, Blue. In the end, all three lose to Red, who was mentored by Oak to do the loving thing. **All three (Agatha, Lance, Blue) do exactly what Agatha says you should do-NOT GO SOFT** 

* **Since Lance is raised by Agatha, him and Oak have a very strained relationship. That is why he might seem to try to favor his grandson sometimes (trying to make up for lost time with his own son)**

* Both have the same hair style. Father-Son relationship or same haircut at Great Clips?

**AGATHA BEING GIOVANNI'S MOTHER?**

*I KNOW IN THE TV SERIES GIOVANNI HAS A MOTHER ALREADY, BUT THIS IS THE MOTHER IN THE POKEMON GAMES*


* First, when you look at the picture, they both have the same exact face structure except with different hair. Second, Giovanni does the same thing that Agatha said to do to Lance-""never go soft and dominate your pokemon!"" He takes that a little bit too far. **Although he might not realize him and Lance are brothers, Giovanni is related (in a way) to Lance and to Blue.**

Deoxys has a round crystalline core-organ, giving it regenerative capabilities and ultimately functioning as the brain of the Pokemon. This core is also capable of transmitting light and energy for attacks. Deoxys is said to have mutated from a virus on a meteor when struck by a laser. 

   Another, not as well known Pokemon is said to have come from space, having a crystalline core, giving it regenerative capabilities and functioning as a brain for the Pokemon. Attacks are often dealt from this core, and this core transmits radio signals, and light. This Pokemon is Staryu. Staryu may have also stemmed from a virus from space and quickly mutated into the star Pokemon, though it is unlikely for this to have happened so often. It is more likely that the meteor carried the crystalline organ and the virus then facilitated growth of the star-body from the core. 

   The mutation involved in making Deoxys must have involved enhancement of its core's transmitting power, as it is now psychic, not water. Staryu gains psychic powers upon its evolution into Starmie, showing that the core is very capable of this. As further evidence of this, in the movie *Destiny Deoxys*, Deoxys was seen gaining control of robotic cubes with its core. 

   The colors of Deoxys' cores are Purple and Green (Destiny Deoxys).

However in the original RGBY Professor Oak's pokedex is clearly a notebook. [On closer inspection it almost looks like a filing briefcase](http://www.velocitygamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/252384-pokemon_red_version_gbc_screenshot4_super.gif). This is not a machine, but would likely be a filing system to allow Red and Blue to document the creatures they encounter. The main question I will be posing is am I correct in this assumption or do they really look like machines, but based on the limitations of the Gambeoy I'm just blind?

If so, this would change everything we thought we knew about the original games. The Hypno entry is the most susceptible to change in this way. Whilst travelling around Kanto, Red would hear stories of strange or rare pokemon, especially Hypno. It seems that most people know what a Hypno is, but you rarely actually encounter a trainer with one. This would likely lead to folklore, similar to a real world chupacabra, and mythical stories of what Hypno does for fun. The story being that once, a Hypno hypnotised a child and took it away. Hearing this, Red would record it in his pokedex since he hasn't got much else to go on. 

Additionally, you never encounter Kadabra in the wild. So the only way to actually make a recording of the pokemon is to evolve an Abra. Similarly to Hypno, people *knew* of Kadabra, but rarely saw one, so stories started to go about of a child who turned into a Kadabra.

Another interesting point is Cubone. Considering the first time you encounter one is just before fighting the ghost of it's mother, Red's observation is based on this one Cubone. It wears the skull of it's dead mother. This is not an observation on Cubone as a species, but on this particular Cubone.

Compare these to the entries for Pidgey. Red has the chance to observe Pidgey a lot before the chance to catch one. This means that he is able to make note of their actions as a species.

TL;DR The pokedex is actually a notebook for Red to record his observations on pokemon. The more rare a wild pokemon is, the less chance Red has to actually make an observation so he uses folklore instead

Eevee is a very interesting pokemon in the fact that it can evolve into so many types. Its Pokedex entries state that Eevee's genetic code is erratic and because of that, it can take many forms to suit its environments. It also mentions that there are very few still alive.

I can't help but wonder if this means that Eevee was the first pokemon created by Mew and used as a blueprint for all subsequent pokemon. The idea is that Mew allowed radiation to flood certain types of areas (volcanoes, tundra, deep caves, bodies of water, electrically charged/magnetic fields, grassy forests, ect) and made Eevee’s DNA in such a way that it could be manipulated or have code ‘filled in’ by such radiations. By allowing the “normal” Eevee to react differently to so many environments, Mew was able to figure out which abilities were best applicable to certain areas and created pokemon types to have an elemental advantage in extreme habitats. As Eevee continued to interact with these environments, the radiation Mew made them react to in regards to these environments wore off/was used up and became a rarity in the modern world.  What’s left is now mined as rare evolution stones.

Eevees are now a rarity because they can no longer adapt to their environments because there aren't enough stones to go around. They're no longer able to 'evolve' to environmental standards and are forced to remain in it's most basic and helpless form.

Moon catastrophe,108,17,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1dydr6/ancient_pokemon_extinction_and_indepth_analysis/,"Hello fellow conspiracy theorists/colleagues!  I am back today to once again submit for your review, another interesting theory on the history of the pokemon world!  Please share your thoughts and feel free to build on this in the comments below.

-----

The general thesis:  Perhaps [hundreds of] millions of years ago (date to be verified), some sort of catastrophic event (3 theories will be presented below) occurred that wiped out the a large population pokemon.  The epicenter of this catastrophe was none other than at **Mt. Moon**.

I will digress: due to time constraints, I have dedicated most of this write-up's content to explaining theory 1.  I could go into more detail for theories 2 and 3, but I'm just getting tired now (lol).
 
-----

Theory #1 (I shall refer to this as the volcano theory):

* Mt. Moon is now a dormant volcano; in pre-historic times, the volcano was active, and an instance of this volcano's activity led to the localized extinction of pokemon.

Supporting Evidence for (1):

* The above theory was devised after I did a brief exploration into the Rhyhorn-Rhydon-Rhyperior family.  It is said that Rhydon is ""capable of living in molten lava up to 3600 degrees"", and that Rhyperior was observed to have developed an Ankylosaur-like tail (which is a striking resemblence to dinosaurs unearthed in the real world).  These traits led me to the side-theory that this family of pokemon should be classified as 'ancient' (with their survival tieing into the extinction theory).  This point will tie in at the end.

* Pewter city: this city pays homeage to the rock attribute.  It is known that as magma cools, it eventually turns into igneous rock.  A volcanic eruption at Mt. Moon may have wiped out the area we now know as Pewter city, and thus, gave birth to the city's eventual theme/name when humans colonized the area.

* Cerulean city: upon entering this city, that there is a decent-sized body of water nearby (along nugget bridge).  However, you may notice that Cerulean city is actually quite land-locked, and isn't actually that close to an ocean or a sea.  How is this possible?  I theorize that there is a large reservoir/underground lake/ground water in the vicinity, geologically speaking.  If you venture deep in to Cerulean cave, you will notice that there is an abundance of water down there - an underground sea, if you will.  This reservior was present at the time of the Mt. Moon eruption, and this water served to prevent the progression of magma on this side of the volcano, contrast to the Pewter area.  As the localized area was effictively saved from devastation due to this ground water, this is why we see the city pay homeage to the water attribute.  As an aside (which may also add supporting evidence to this), nugget bridge is called this for a reason - for the abundance of gold that can be found in the vicinity.  You are given a nugget piece upon making your way across the bridge, and you can also find multiple nuggets when you ventrue through Cerulean cave.  You may or may not know this, but gold and other ores on the planet's exterior exist as a result of molten fluids being pushed from below the crust, and cooling as they head towards the surface.  This would support a volcano theory.

* Back to the Rhyhorn family - remember how Rhydon was said to be ""capable of living in molten lava up to 3600 degrees""?  I believe this family of pokemon originally populated the area of Mt. Moon, and fled to Cerulean cave when there was an eruption, hence why you can encounter them in there.  The temperature tolerance allowed this species to safely escape the eruption to a safer area (for the record, relocation would have been necessary due to the pursuit of food and water).  Cerulean cave would have been a perfect place to relocate as it would have sheltered the young, and also had a good supply of water, as mentioned earlier.  Likewise, many other 'smart' pokemon also fled to Cerulean cave, for protection and the abeforementioned water supply.  In general, I will say that the 'smart' pokemon are those who have more experience and ability to escape/survive disaster - and this would translate to what trainers call 'higher levels'.  This would explain why we see such high level pokemon dominate the cave.  Please keep in mind that I'm not necessaily saying that the pokemon you encounter are millions of years old, but rather, are the surviving descendants of the original survivors (strong family lineage).  As another aside, it is quite fitting that we commonly find Chanseys in the cave. As they are now commonly used as healing assistants in pokecenters, they may have historically played a role in rehabilitating Cerulean cave inhabitants from burn damage.

* Note that the fossil pokemon you found in R/B/Y all shared rock attributes.  I postulate that this rock attribute is what allowed those pokemon to become fossilized.  As the Rhyhorn family could survive molten temperatures, they would not have been killed off from a volcanic eruption - and hence, why you do not find fossils of them.  Other pokemon that perished during the volcanic eruption would have been organic in nature, and their fossils would not have been preserved.


Implications of the volcano theory:

* We can get a nice picture of the geography in the region before the catastrophe occured.

*  We can deduce why Pewter city and Cerulean city pay homeage to the rock and water attributes, respectively.

*  We can explain why there is an abundance of high level pokemon in Cerulean cave.

-----

Theory #2 (I shall refer to this as the meteor theory):

* Moon stones are commonly found at Mt. Moon, which are believed to be fragments of meteorites from outer space.  A large meteor may have collided with the planet's surface, causing mass extinction.  

* Please refer to [here](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031202065204.htm) for details on fallout and apply it to the pokemon universe, if you believe in meteor theory (sorry... I'm getting lazy at this point since the post is so long)

Theory #3 (I shall refer to this as the colonization theory):

* It is generally accepted that the Clefairy/Clefable family is from outer space.  Mt. Moon may be the family's choice of location for colonization, and they may have forced the local pokemon population to relocate.  For pokemon who were resistant, the Clefairy/Clefables made an example of their species, exterminating them, and in the process turning them into fossils.

Please note that the meteor/colonization and volcano theories could very well be independent of one another.  It is quite possible the volcano theory could be true, and some time later, a meteor also crashed at Mt. Moon/colonization occurred. 

-----

General supporting evidence:

* In as early as Pokemon red/blue, the player comes across the Dome and Helix fossils at Mt. Moon.  Old amber is found at the nearby Pewter city museum.

* There are notices posted around/throughout Pewter city indicating that theives have been stealing fossils from Mt. Moon - this clearly indicates that there are more fossils to be found.

* This indicates that there are certain (whole) species of pokemon who were completely wiped out due to some significant event.

He sits in his room, all day, never speaking to anyone. His mother has become concerned, and has decided that the only way to help him is to give him something the forget about his loss. After calling in countless favors of friends, and working out a deal with Professor Oak, who's grandson has responded to his own losses by becoming self-centered and combative, the stage is set for your (very literal) road to recovery.

They wait for you to take the first step. When you've finally decided to leave your room, and take a step outside the safety of your town, the Professor realizes that the time is right. You are given a pokemon, to start your ""adventure,"" which is actually a carefully orchestrated path to keep you safe while giving you the illusion of accomplishment to help you overcome your grief.

The trainers you fight are actors, instructed to take the fall to build your self-esteem. There are only so many actors, which explains why you have so many repeat fights with different names. The gym leaders purposefully use weaker pokemon, because their actual best are way out of your league (explaining why a little kid can beat a recognized ""gym leader""). Same with the elite four. ""Team Rocket"" is made up of your father's former army buddies, who have agreed to fake crimes to help teach you a lesson about standing up to injustice. Of course, most are not professional trainers like the gym leaders, so they've had to rely on common pokemon to get involved.

There are things going on behind the scenes, too. You're being constantly followed, and protected. If something happens to you, and your pokemon all faint, it's likely that you'll have some sort of a nervous breakdown. To help that, your mother is tailing you the whole way, ready to step in if the actor's go too far while fighting you, or a wild pokemon manages to get the better of your team. If you lose, you white out, and wake up safely in a pokemon center. The money you lose is what it cost for whatever treatments you needed.

Moreover, all those little roadblocks and detours that kept you ""on the rails?"" Those were put in place to make sure you didn't skip any part of this elaborate farce, and more importantly, to give others time to prepare for you . It'd be a real shame for this whole charade to fall apart because you walked in to Saffron city before the Team Rocket actors had a chance to get in position.

In the end, everything works out. You feel the sense of accomplishment of beating the pokemon league, and overcome your fear of the world. Perhaps someday you will be able to earn that honor legitimately, but you never would have been able to without facing your fears. Professor Oak's grandson has learned a big lesson in humility, and will grow up to be a more balanced individual.

Unfortunately, the epilogue is not so cheery. While Oak's grandson grows up to become a gym leader (and is even willing to do his part in some other kid's adventure in the future), the protagonist doesn't fare so well. His temporary recovery is short lived. When the veil is pulled back, and he learns that the whole adventure was a lie, he reverts back to his silent self, and runs away. He hides himself in a cave, where he trains his pokemon, deluding himself that he is really the greatest pokemon master. It's not until three years later, when a kid in a similar situation challenges and defeats him, that he finally faces reality.

He has a key role in the whole franchise and his plans are almost unexplained.

In my opinion Professor Oak's role in the first two generation is very similar to that of the G-Man. He chooses Ethan (I'll explain why he does not choose Red later) as his champion, as well as the G-man chose Gordon Freeman during the Black Mesa incident.

Oak is the one who makes Red's journey begin, as he gives him his first Pokemon and his first quests. He probably knows everything about Red's progression. For example, he knows when Red tries to use his bike indoors. After Red defeats Blue, he arrives in the champion's room just a moment after the fight has ended. When Red enters the hall of fame with him, he puts the trainer in stasis (this is just speculation).

Three years later, Oak shows up at the beginning of Ethan's adventure in Mr Pokemon's home.

In a Nuzlocke Game I'm running, I implemented the rule that I could never use a pokemon in a gym battle that was a higher level than the Gym Leader's highest level pokemon.

Now, My theory is this:

Brock is an extremely competent pokemon trainer.  However, once you enter his pokemon gym, you play under his rules. In this instance, he chose to play a match where his Geodude and Onix were his chosen pokemon.

Imagine if you were an experienced pokemon trainer, and Brock was the 8th gym badge you were looking to gain.  Under Brock's house rules of ""No pokemon over level 12"", you would have to rely on your PC Pokemon to succeed against him, offering up a different challenge.

It's clear when you return to Kanto in Gold and Silver that the Gym Leaders have other pokemon available, and don't just stick to a specific level set (Since Brock has Pokemon around level 50 in Gen II), and also offers up different pokemon, too.

But who were they at war with is the true question. Many people say Hoenn, since R/S/E took place the same time R/B/G/Y did. But Hoenn doesn't really seem like it's a place at war. IIRC, there are more adult male characters in that game than in 1st gen. Not only that, but the Hoenn economy seems to be striving. They've got a nice space center, a good shipping industry, they have time for contests(which shouldn't be a priority during wartime), and the battle frontier which seems to be just for fun times. Furthermore, in FR/LG after you beat the Cinnibar gym Bill takes you to One Island. There, you help his friend Celio complete his device that allows interaction with the Hoenn games. Countries at war probably wouldn't try to have fun with each other by trading and battling. Well, the battling may be a civilized competition to determine the war, but it's not likely.

While you may be able to have communications with Hoenn in FR/LG, you still cannot go to Johto. The Johto region is right next door and we already know it exists so why are we not able to go there, but in G/S/C/HG/SS we are able to go into Kanto?  That leads me to believe that Kanto is actually at war with Johto. The two regions are so close together, but have no real contact til three years later, which gives Johto enough time to recover from the war.

Serperior could be in fact a reference to Lucifer/Satan.

1.  As it says in the link, during the course of its evolution Snivy gradually lost its legs.  At the start of *Paradise Lost*, Lucifer/Satan looks like the rest of his fellow angels, with the notable exception that he is ""fallen"" since he has gone against God.  When he returns to Hell from Earth after tempting Eve, and thus Adam, in the guise of a serpent, he and the other demons receive their punishment: turning into snakes.

2.  Serperior's Dream World Ability is Contrary.  [According to bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Contrary_(ability)), the Japanese means ""Devil's Advocate.""

3. (Somewhat related to #1) Serperior's name is supposedly a combination of ""Serpent"" and ""Superior"" (Or ""Warrior,"" which, although a bit of a stretch, might make sense).  This makes sense since Satan is not only associated with the Serpent, but also as the ruler, and thus most ""superior"" being, of Hell.

Some coincidences:

1. Serperior's Unova Dex # is #003.  One of Satan's reasons for rebelling against God (Assuming he's #001) was that God placed the Son, and not Satan, as his second-in-command (#002).

2. Serperior is a Grass type, although there isn't any indication in the name.  Perhaps this was because of the Serpent's association with the **Tree** of Knowledge?

1342971310.0,86,self.pokemonconspiracies,wyvzx,The transform-state theory,104,18,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wyvzx/the_transformstate_theory/,"Well, let's resume a few points:

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Mimic, Mirror Move, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

2. Let's assume Ditto is a failed Mew clone, or at least related to it, like being a breed of some sorts

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3hXmr3wZT0&amp;t=0m27s), you can see that when a pokémon is evolving, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So, this teory is very simple and it explains a lot of things, first:

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew, but two Mew which transformed into couples of pokémon.
2. The other pokémon, being Mew's offspring, retain part of the ability to transform, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process
3. When a pokémon evolves, it is transforming into another, and the limits of the transformation, however, are defined by the species
4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, and that same state can be used to be stored into special computers, also explaining why pokémon like Conkeldurr can get its pillars inside a pokéball: he gets them into the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve, such as in Machop, Prinplup and Tyrogue's cases
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, such as Beldum and Magnemite, don't do that when they are with trainers. They do that when they are on the wild. The *transform state*'s properties allow them to ""duplicate"" themselves after having enough experience points. When they don't have enough experience points they can perform an evolution by merging, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points, a pokémon gets unstable and volatile, being able to tap into its Mew-like powers to get into the transform-state and transform into the next evolutionary stage of its species.
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, in the transform-state, a portion of its experience points are consumed in order to keep that 'form', and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

If the mother does not die the baby will grow up to be a Kangaskhan. However, it is odd that there is a disproportionate number of Cubone and Marowak in Kanto than Kangaskhan- one of the rarest and most difficult pokemon to catch in the game.

Kangaskhan are very rare and are found in Safari Zones in Kanto, Johto and Sinnoh, which they have been IMPORTED. Ash's Pokedex (in the anime) explicitly states Kangaskhan almost went extinct. Additionally they are all female. This suggests the Kangaskhan are in the middle of a highly regulated conservation effort- Their young may be the last remaining hope for the Kangaskhan species. In subsequent generations Kangaskhan can be found outside the Safari Zone- Rock Tunnel and Great Marsh- but remain to be a rare Pokemon. So perhaps their numbers are slowly rebounding.

So where did they all go?
Another well known theory refers to the recent Pokemon war. The Pokedex entry in Silver reads: ""To protect its young, it will never give up during battle, no matter how badly wounded it is."" In a war, who wouldn't utilize a Pokemon that will fight to the death. Also, Kangaskhan can learn extremely powerful attacks from almost each Pokemon type (Blizzard, Earthquake, Focus Punch, Hyper Beam, Solar Beam, Thunder, Fire Blast, Iron Tail). Kangaskhan were round up by the 'PokeGovernments'. Many Kangaskhan died in the war, which resulted in a dramatic spike in the Cubone population.

They may have also been subject to poaching- Giovanni is one of the few (if not only) trainers in Kanto with a Kangaskhan- suggesting Team Rocket or other criminal organizations may have been a factor in their endangerment; however, no other members of TR have one.

So why can we catch them?
Kuiper put forth an interesting speculation into the post-war Pokemon world in ""A deconstruction of the first generation Pokemon World."" stating that, in the Pokemon world, the right to have a Pokemon for protection is a right to all citizens. Therefore no one is allowed to keep you from catching one, but they may charge you to enter the Safari Zone- which probably funds conservation efforts.

It has gained a lot of popularity with people saying Roark is another son of Giovanni, that Roark *is* Silver (as suggested by the image), or some other theory.  What I intend to present is something radically different.

Let's go back to the RBY days, when Giovanni led Team Rocket.  Giovanni commissioned cloning projects in order to eventually create a clone of Mew to be used as an ultimate weapon.  As it happens, this might have been a front for even further experimentation.  Giovanni might have had work done on human cloning, a potentially more difficult and riskier effort than cloning a pokemon.

The purpose behind this hidden cloning project was for Giovanni to have a clone of himself.  This clone would serve to take Giovanni's place should something happen to him (say untimely death by illness or otherwise).  The process of creating Mewtwo happened well before the events of RBY, and presumably the human cloning project occurred before the games, perhaps even during.  All the same, the cloned Giovanni is a successful project after the ""success"" in Mewtwo's creation.  During the chaos of Team Rocket's fall, the clone escaped from his ""captivity"" and stumbled into the world.

He quickly realized how to get around while also discovering just who he was.  Because of this, the clone disguised himself and fled the Kanto region.  He ended up on Iron Island, where he built a cabin and lived a hermetic life for a few years.  His appearance became scruffier and less recognizable to passing trainers, whom he had met and learned much from.  In time, the clone also took up the name **Byron** to further differentiate himself from his original.  Certain quirks of Giovanni were maintained in ""Byron,"" such as an affinity for pokemon of the earth.  Rather than ground-types however, Byron began to see more in the steel-types.  He soon became an admired trainer on Iron Island and a formidable challenge for passing trainers.

After a few years, Byron left the Sinnoh region and returned to the Kanto region to travel and learn what had become of his other.  This likely occurred towards the end of the events of HGSS.  Finding nothing in Kanto, he made his way over to the Johto region.  By chance, Silver came across the clone.  In spite of the differences (wild hair, scruffy face, worn appearance), Silver clearly spotted the uncanny similarities to his own father.  Silver angrily confronts the clone, but after a discussion becomes intrigued by him.  They speak more over several days and Silver soon takes to the clone better than he did his own father (remember their argument during the HGSS Celebi event.  Silver did not respect Giovanni nor did his find his father's delusional goals to be worthwhile/achievable).

After Silver and Byron bonded, they left Johto and returned to Sinnoh.  At Byron's suggestion, Silver took up a new name and guise as Roark.  Byron also took to mind how Silver was able to recognize him, and assuming others might note similarities, he began dying his hair from jet black to a rust color.  Silver, in spite of everything, also took to earth-based pokemon and began specializing in rock-types.  Before long (perhaps a year at most), Byron and Roark became gym leaders of Canalave City and Oreburgh City, respectively.  Their speedy rise can be attributed to Silver's/Roark's experience through Johto and Byron's experience on Iron Island.

And the abridged version:  Giovanni had a clone, said clone escaped to Sinnoh, became Byron, returned after HGSS, met and bonded with Silver, and the two returned to Sinnoh where Silver took up a new name as Roark.

The region is also way more advanced technologically than any other region (Except maybe unova i haven't played B/W yet) My theory is that Orre is where the weapon that caused mutations in animals that led to pokemon was deployed. the weapons effects here were more exxagerated than they were in outlying regions (maybe even a prototype gone wrong) It wiped the region clean of almost all life and left it uninhabitable. Over the years criminals from various regions moved to the orre region to avoid persecution from the established regions. The criminals would have mostly come from johto and hoenn since team rocket had moved from kanto to johto when it was disbanded and then after being disbanded again moved to orre where they joined with fugitives from team magma and team aqua to form multiple criminal organizations (Other than hoenn orre is the only region with more than one criminal organization and the preexisting animosity between aqua and magma led to a division in organizations rather than a single organization). The other group of people trying to reclaim the region would have been scientist who were studying the pre war technology. Between the scientists and the criminals the region grew into a technologically advanced place riddled with division between the rich and the poor. They rediscovered and rebuilt many pre war technology. However the large amount of criminal activity in the region kept the govt's from surrounding regions to claim it. However surrounding regions would have supported scientific outpost's to the region to asses threats from the devastation (Radiation?) and would have supplied trade (Hoenn borders orre i believe so this is why hoenn is more advanced than kanto even though their games take place at the same time (I believe). This also accounts for johto and hoenn pokemon being most prevalent in orre they were imported from johto /hoenn or brought there by fugitives.

1337731500.0,83,self.pokemonconspiracies,u04x1,"Lavender Town ""Missing Frequencies"" Music",102,19,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u04x1/lavender_town_missing_frequencies_music/,"Hello /r/pokemonconspiracies/ This is my first ever actual post on Reddit. I've been lurking this subreddit for a few days now and I have been fascinated with what I've learned. I wish to dedicate time and effort to help support conspiracies and help us find the truth behind Pokemon. Enough about me, let's begin shall we?

One of the conspiracies I was very fond of was the Lavender Town music. All concepts of it. From the suicides to the missing frequencies and so on. If you haven't heard of the missing frequencies here is the link to the popular video on YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8

If you haven't read the description of the video I recommend it, it's quite good Creepypasta. However I regret to inform you that it is a complete and utter lie. This is easily predicted by the lack of an accurate source other than the description to give any assistance to the claim. I am not here to disprove theories. I am quite for their support. I do not agree with spreading incredibly false real world information with a lack of sources or intentionally edited material. The description is also looked at with a conspiracy twist that the beginning letters of each paragraph spell out ""I am dead"" Now that would be quite interesting if the user who uploaded its latest activity wasn't February of this year when the video was uploaded in July 2010. Yes I suppose someone could have gotten on the account but I'm not a superstitious one. 

The video part is significant for the fact that the Marowak's ghost appears twice in the video. Once somewhere around 3:00. And the second time around 9:00. The second time in the video it is accompanied by some Unown that spell out ""Leave Now"". The user ever so kindly left a .wav file for us in the description. So I went out and picked up a Spectrograph program (this is somewhat similar to the program used in the video) and see if it was truly there, but using that .wav file wasn't enough. I downloaded the .mp3s for the actual video, Lavender Town's actual music, and the so called ""Beta"" Lavender Town  music (the one that allegedly killed 200+ kids, which is also just a mere creepypasta with a lack of sources). I then converted the .mp3's to .wav's. I tested the one provided in the description first, and sure enough both instances of the ghost and the one instance of the Unown appeared. Interesting, but obviously not satisfying. The same occurred for the actual video's file. However it did not happen once in the actual or beta music. The reasons why are obvious, the edited video contains ""Missing Frequencies"". Which are edited in by the uploaders alleged friend. Although all that plays during those parts are almost white noise sounding noises. It's not actual music, much less to actually be included in the game. We all agree that Pokemon was directed at children for obvious reasons. It is not debatable that Nintendo or Game Freak would intentionally leave out these sounds just for someone to find in the end. They wouldn't. It could possibly butcher sales if something like that was done. All the speculation about the games is great but it's not something that was done by Gamefreak. I am determined to research as much as I can about Lavender Town but I feel that the music, although eerie, and the beta version headache inducing, to be irrelevant to the true secrets behind Lavender Town. 

Conspiracy theories are great and I thoroughly enjoy them. This I don't find to be a necessarily a conspiracy theory. Rather deliberately modified material to spook the community. Wavelengths like that don't just form and they certainly aren't ""missing"". It doesn't sound good with the music and for them to form Unown which were not introduced to the Poke world until Generation 2 it is safe to say that this is an illogical theory and should not be accepted as real. 

Thank you for your time fellow conspirators.

In Gen I you have to deliver Oak's Parcel from the Viridian City Pokemart to Professor Oak back in Pallet Town. There is very little information provided on this parcel, but upon delivering to Oak he states ""It's the custom pokeball I ordered, thank you!""

My immediate thought on this is that Professor Oak must have received a Master Ball just like the one you receive from President Silph. The President says that the ball is a prototype and you can't get them in stores... So maybe only Oak and President Silph ever got to own the prototype master ball before it was fully tested. I have considered that these both might be the same ball, but I find it doubtful. Why would Professor Oak just send it right back to the Silph, especially if Saffron City is under such a security threat?

Anyway, Professor Oak is an avid trainer and professor and could easily acquire all the other types of pokeballs by visiting a shop, so I don't think he would order ONE ball by mail if it were just a great ball or ultra ball. It must have had some significance if he would get a single ball custom made. But maybe I am over-thinking this and it was just a fancy pokeball with a cosmetic change, or one of the prototypes for a newer ball found in the later generations.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_11bztr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11bztr/oaks_parcel_whats_really_inside/,

Ditto (the clay) would have to be able to learn any move, which is why knows transform. While Ditto was shapeless, Mew would teach it the moves it could learn (the reason Mew can learn any move; it needs to know them for teaching purposes). It would then shape the Ditto. Ditto are generated by Mew, which is why they abound on Cinnabar Island in the lab where Mewtwo was made. When Mew was cloned, the part of its DNA that made the Ditto remained, and when the lab was destroyed the cloning machine wasn't completely turned off, so it continues to make new Ditto.

EDIT:    The reason Ditto gets the same EVs (if you don't know what those are, I don't completely understand the concept either, so go on wikipedia or another website and look it up) and has the same weight and color scheme as Mew is because Ditto comes from Mew. Is produced by Mew. Is generated by Mew. You could even say Ditto is a part of Mew.

EDIT (again):    The reason there are so many Ditto in Cerulean Cave (where Mewtwo is) is because Mewtwo is an imperfect clone and continues to generate Ditto without meaning to. This is one of the errors mentioned by the cloning reports. Ditto can also divide and multiply into two different Ditto (like bacteria), which means there really only had to be a couple leftover Ditto at the Cinnabar Island lab in order for there to be a whole population now.

First, I would like to thank whoever put me on the headline of PokemonConspiracies.  Though I would like to suggest perhaps having an Pokemon Biology ""Index"" as a post with links to all of the Pokemon, as opposed to listing each individually. Perhaps putting it in the sidebar?  Just my suggestion!

Secondly, due to the large amount of requests I've been getting, I'll be putting a couple Pokemon in the comments, the one with the most upvotes will be my next project, so get voting!

Eevee

**Reproduction:** Reproduction is similar to a Fennec Fox, in that they fertilize internally.  Eevee's are familial Pokemon.  Once they find a mate, it is often for life.  Because of this discriminancy Eevee do not have nearly as many babies as other Pokemon (I'm looking at you Magikarp).  Eevee's pregnancy lasts 2 months and has the potential to produce as many as 6 Eevee.  When the baby is born it's ears are folded over, but unfurl within a few days.

**Growth:**  The kits (baby Eevee's) are born blind.  Within 3 weeks the kits open their eyes, around the eighth week they grow teeth.  After 10 to 12 weeks the Eevee can be considered fully grown and is about 0.3m high and weighs 6.5kg.
Eevee's are actually evenly distributed from male to female.  The cause for an uneven distribution in the wild is due to a few reasons.  Once a family is made, a male often goes hunting for the kits and the female, whereas the female will remain in their den in order to protect her children.  Most trainers come across males hunting for food, and rarely do they find the female. Eevee was once a very common sight, however, due to its fine fur and silky texture, it was hunted by primitive humans for blankets, clothes, and other cloth.  Because of this, Eevee's were hunted pretty close to extinction.  While on the brink of extinction, scientists took female Eevees and bred them with dittos to repopulate. This is why Eevee's have become so rare and have become increasingly more common in each generation.

**Nutrition:** What an Eevee eats depends on the biome it lives in.  For example, an Eevee living in a volcanic area (flareon) will drink from hotsprings, and lava.  Eevees living on a beach (vaporeon) hunt crawfish and upon evolution hunt other Pokemon.  Eevees living near electrical plants (jolteon) eat wires and straight electricity. Growing up in the day light areas near towns (Espeon) allow Eevee to eat various rodents.  The night is very much the same (Umbreon).  Glaceon eats ice and Leafeon eats leaves.

**Natural Moveset:**

* Helping Hand: Being a family Pokemon, Eevee works well with others and is able to coordinate attacks with partner Pokemon to inflict extra damage.

* Tackle: Eevee throws his entire body at his opponent.

* Tail Whip: By waving his bushy tail in an opponent's face, the opponent has been known to lower his guard.

* Sand Attack: Eevee kicks sand at his opponent, hopefully blinding them.

* Growl: A menacing growl.

* Quick Attack: Being so small and light Eevee is able to move quickly and smash into his opponent at high speeds.

* Bite: Eevee's teeth have developed into strong sharp weapons, dealing incredible pain to anyone it decides to take a bite out of. Eevee develops strong teeth to expand it's diet, whether it needs stronger teeth to survive molten rock, or chew through the tough skin of a Magikarp.

* Covet: Eevee can use it's quick movements to steal from his opponent.  This was an evolutionary trait  that was acquired once people started settling the world.  It is thought Eevee learned this to quietly steal food from humans.

* Take Down/Double-Edge: Eevee's skeleton is developed enough to take strong vibrations, causing it's tackle to inflict more damage.

* Charm: The name says it all.

* Baton Pass: An extension of Eevee's Helping Hand.  Being a sociable Pokemon it can easily give it's friends boosts.

* Last Resort: If Eevee is backed into a corner it becomes quite ferocious, attacking with teeth and nails in an attempt to escape.

* Trump Card: Similar to Last Resort, Eevee will use this attack when backed into a corner. It is essentially an alternative to Last Resort.

In order to evolve an Eevee releases certain hormones based on the environment.  Evolution is also affected by the parents (which is why ditto bred Eevee's are so popular, it gives Eevee the potential to evolve into anything the trainer wants).  Their mothers milk contains the hormones set toward their type, further influencing their evolution.  In reality, an Eevee is truly a marvel of Evolution.

**Vaporeon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time in an aquatic environment, such as the beach, or near a lake will evolve into a Vaporeon.  In the wild the change is very slow and deliberate, and throughout the entire process an Eevee's fur will begin to wash away with the ocean, revealing a sleek undercoat.  The process begins with the splitting of the tail, taking a matter of weeks to reach the full split.  The gills and frills are the next to come, allowing the Vaporeon to breathe underwater for extended periods of time. Finally comes the dorsal fin, allowing Vaporeon to increase his speed.
Scientists have devised a way to bestow the nature of the sea onto an Eevee in a matter of minutes, through the use of the Evolutionary Stone; Water Stone.  It is not fully understood how this works, however, it is known to cause a mass release of hormones creating the quick change from Eevee to Vaporeon.  No side effects are currently known.

**Jolteon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time near electrical plants, or anywhere with an excess amount of electricity is liable to evolve into a Jolteon.  The static from the electricity causes Eevee's fur to stand on end, forming into sharp points.  This includes the tail, which becomes shorter, but much thicker in order to decrease the distance electricity must flow from the brain to increase reaction time.
A Thunderstone has similar effects to a Waterstone.

**Flareon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time near Volcanoes will evolve into a Flareon.  The gradual colour shift comes from the intense heat from lava, actually tanning the fur, creating an orangish colouration.  Due to the large amount of flame eaten a Flareon is able to breathe fire!
A Firestone has similar effects to a Waterstone.

**Espeon/Umbreon Evolution:**
Depending on whether Eevee is a nocturnal animal, it may evolve into either an Espeon, or an Umbreon.  While out in the day, a pre-Espeon will absorb sunlight in a manner similar to photosynthesis, however, instead of converting sunlight to energy for survival, it converts it into psychic power.  This psychic power builds up, corrupting many cells in Eevee's body, causing the change of fur, as well as the tail split as the tail continues to grow. Upon finding something the Espeon enjoys (such as the small gem commonly found on an Espeon), the Espeon's psychic powers will place the gem (or other important item) on Espeon's head, creating a point where Espeon may focus it's psychic powers.
Umbreon is much less complicated.  It's fur becomes darker in order for it to blend in with the night, creating an ideal predator.  It will often paint markings on itself in the hopes of warding off any potential predators.

**Glaceon/Leafeon Evolution:**
These two evolutions are strange mutations found in the Eevee evolutionary spectrum.  Apparently the growth of a certain moss, releases a quick and powerful acting powder, so fine that it is almost impossible to detect with the naked eye.  Eevee's skin reacts to this powder, causing an almost instantaneous evolution into Leafeon.
Once the moss has frozen, the powder actually mutates, although it is still released, even through a solid wall of ice.  This mutated powder causes a similar (though still significantly different) reaction as the original powder.  Eevee once again has an extremely fast reaction to the powder, evolving into a Glaceon.

**EDIT:** I would like to give credit to Madocvalanar for help on the making of this article! Due to his work, I was able to release this nearly a week early!

I mean, Deoxys was a space virus, and the only other virus that we know about in PokeEarth is Pokerus.  Naturally, I grouped them together, but I haven't seen any other theories concluding this, so I thought I'd share mine.

My theory is relatively simple.  Like, I stated above, the virus that was on the meteor from which Deoxys came was Pokerus.  If we speak soley in game-canon, and disclude the Destiny Deoxys movie, we don't know exactly when this laser mutated the space virus into Deoxys.  Deoxys could very well have come into being before the G/S/C games (the first Pokemon to include Pokerus).  Please correct me if there is evidence in the games that can narrow down Deoxys' date of origin.  

So, if we assume that Deoxys predates the first sightings of Pokerus, we might hypothesize that the meteor was the origin of Pokerus on PokeEarth; perhaps, even Deoxys itself is responsible for the introduction of Pokerus into PokeEarth's Pokemon population (alliteration just went to a whole new level).  

Now, I should probably introduce what little evidence I have that I'm using to link Deoxys and Pokerus.  Let's take a minute to define both Pokerus and Deoxys.  *Pokerus* is a Pokemon virus that amplifies the amount of EVs a Pokemon receives from all battles for a day, more or less.  EVs are the stats that a Pokemon has recieved from fighting other Pokemon.  The six stats are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.  *Deoxys* is the living mutation of a virus found on a space rock, but what else is special about Deoxys?  It can morph into four different forms: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed.

Normal Form is pretty unremarkable compared to the other three.  Attack form raises both Deoxys' Atk and SpA stats.  Defense Form raises it's Def and SpD stats.  And Speed Form raises it's Spe stat.  Now, let's compare:  Pokerus is a Pokemon Virus of unknown origin that amplifies EV (stat) intake on infected Pokemon.  Deoxys is a mutated space virus that has forms which exemplify each of the six stats (minus HP).  Is it sound to assume that Deoxys and Pokerus share an origin, or are even one and the same?  I'd like to hear your input, /r/pokemonconspiracies!

Growlithe are rare ( more so than in the games) and have just started to become domesticated (possibly before the invention of the pokeball) on farms. The growlithe herd the farm pokemon and fight off invading pokemon. This time is before the usefulness of stones was discovered so they were still a relatively common find. One way or another some of these farm growlithe end up in contact with a fire stone (owners keep the ones they find or growlithe finds one while chasing away a predator). So growlithe evolves into arcanine. In doing so he gets a change of attitude (like ash's charmander) and chooses to leave. The owners will usually only get a quick look at arcanine before it leaves (often beleiving that growlithe was eaten or taken away by the beast) Sometimes some of that old Growlithe loyalty will seep through and arcanine will choose to live near the farm and protect it. So legends rise up about the great creature that protects farms from invaders. Or the evil beast that takes growlithe away (and perhaps even burns down farms). The legends survive, but only vaguely. For the most part only people really into old mythology will know much about the old arcanine stories. As for regular people all they remember is the name ""the legendary pokemon"".

1351533086.0,82,self.pokemonconspiracies,12abab,The Biology of Pokemon: Squirtle,106,24,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12abab/the_biology_of_pokemon_squirtle/,"Squirtle

**Reproduction:**  The reproduction of a Squirtle is the same as a common sea turtle.  The male will mount the female from behind, using his claws to grasp her shell.  The penis, located at the base of the tail, is inserted into a small opening on the base of the female's tail.  This is called the cloaca. Sperm enters into the female and fertilization begins.
The female Squirtle lays her eggs in nests dug into the beach sand.  The eggs hatch and the baby Squirtles (known as Squirts) crawl back to the water, where they become fully grown within a few months.

**Growth:** After hatching from their eggs, Squirts are quite small, only about a tenth of their regular size.  Squirtles quickly grow to their indicated size of 0.5m and 9.0kg. At this point the growth of Squirtle slows tremendously, but in actuality, they never stop growing. The carapace or shell grows along with the body, until it reaches the size of a blastoise.  After 3 months the Squirtle can be considered level 1.  Squirtle also develops a water sac adjacent to his stomach.  Through ingestion of food and drink, some water is diffused through the stomach lining into the water sac, Squirtle can use this water sac to use various attacks, such as water gun and bubble.  Though this sac does not fully develop until Squirtle has become older.

**Nutrition:** Nothing special here, Squirtle eats aquatic and terrestrial plants, though they consider aquatic invertebrates to be a special treat. 

**Natural Moveset:** As a Squirtle gains levels it learns new moves:

* Tackle: Squirtle throws his body at his opponent, inflicting minor damage.

* Tail Whip: Squirtle taunts his opponent using his tail, this annoys the opponent, possibly causing it to rush an attack, creating an opening and thus, lowering defense.

* Bubble: Bubble is the result of a premature attempt at a water gun. The diffusion between the stomach and water sac is not yet perfect, thus, along with water, other substances, such as carbon dioxide can enter into the sac. When Squirtle attempts to shoot a water gun at his opponent, it comes out more like a hiccough, though it does retain some force. The carbon dioxide and water vapour merge to create a thin layer of bubble that quickly forms a spherical shape to reduce surface area. This inflicts minor damage.

* Withdraw: Squirtle's shell is now strong enough to protect it from most attacks. When Squirtle enters his shell, his defense increases dramatically.

* Water gun: The diffusion between the stomach and water sac has improved greatly, Squirtle can now fire the water from the sac at his opponents.  Though some bubbles may still be created in the process, for the most part, it is a stream of water.

* Bite: Squirtle's jaw has developed enough to deliver a devastating bite attack.

* Rapid Spin: Squirtle retreats into his shell and rapidly spins, knocking away any hazards as well as slamming into his opponent.

* Protect: Squirtle's shell is now hard enough that he can retreat inside to prevent literally any attack.

* Water Pulse: Squirtle has more control over his water, he is now able to fire a highly concentrated burst of water with great accuracy.  If the burst is able to strike the opponent in an area that contain a great concentration of nerves (the ganglia, or brain) then the opponent is likely to become disoriented.

* Aqua Tail: Squirtle diffuses water out his tail, and solidifies it by lowering the temperature of his tail. This creates a hard, protective surface that is able to inflict solid damage as well as protecting his tail from any harm.

* Skull Bash: The bones in Squirtle's head are strong enough to bash without fear of harm.

* Iron Defense: Squirtle's shell is now nearly impenetrable.

* Rain Dance: Squirtle releases an incredible amount of water, aimed directly at the sky. This simulates the effects of a rainstorm as the water comes crashing back to earth.

* Hydro Pump: Squirtle is able to heat the water in his sac and fire it out at high velocity. The sheer force of the attack is enough to knock most pokemon down.  This attack inflicts damage through force and heat and is Squirtle's most powerful move.

**First Evolution:** Squirtle's evolution is relatively slow when compared to other pokemon. As Squirtle does not stop growing he can be considered evolved once he has doubled in height and has increased in weight by a factor of 4.  Through Squirtle's lifespan he begins to grow long fluffy hair on his ears which reach their full span upon the completion of the Wartortle evolution.  A long fluffy tail also grows throughout Squirtle's lifespan, however, this is often kept inside his shell, until it has become to big. Squirtle's squirrelly tail remains, however, it is often hidden by the newly grown fluffy tail.  Squirtle's evolution is completely through common growth, as opposed to the normal instant changes.

**Second Evolution:** Thoughout Wartortle's lifespan, the hair on his ears and tail begin to fall off.  Once it has been completely lost it is considered to have evolved into a Blastoise.  The loss of hair reveals that Squirtle's original tail has unfurled, becoming longer and thicker, as well as the growth of small ears.
Midway through the lifespan of a Wartortle, the top ends of his shell begin to flair out, creating the opening that is seen in an adult Blastoise, where the water cannons jut out. It has been theorized that these cannons which are attached to the water sac, are actually grown from the birth of Squirtle, and continue to grow throughout evolutions, experience accelerated growth at these stages.  Upon the evolution of Blastoise, these cannons  are fully formed and ready for use. The cannons are made of various fibers found in their diet that when combined become as hard as steel.

""Kinda to add to how the cannons on blastoise are produced, what if in their diet they also eat stones to aid them in there descent into deeper waters. Once the sediments are consumed they are very slowly dissolved by their stomach acid and some metal ions are released. Through some biological transport systems (blood) the metal ions are absorbed and transported to the water sac where then grow and harden as a metallic alloy to form the cannons.""      - Daanieljabungan

**Ability:**

* Torrent - When Squirtle is backed into a corner he is able to shoot water with a stronger force.

* Water Dish - When it is raining, Squirtle is able to absorb water through his body through diffusion, this restores his vitality.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1352139908.0,,,True,t3_12abab,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12abab/the_biology_of_pokemon_squirtle/,

1362237180.0,77,self.pokemonconspiracies,19iviu,The real reason why there are so many Zubats.,111,34,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/19iviu/the_real_reason_why_there_are_so_many_zubats/,"I haven't slept for 3 days so i'm going to give you the short and sweet version (the original was a convoluted mess)
Zubat is a bat like pokemon. It is nocturnal so it has to find a dark enclosure or area to roost in, generally caves attics, old/unkempt structures. Zubats traditionally gain their sustenance by using leech life, in zubats case a prick with its fangs that absorbs a small amount of energy/blood/lifeforce/etc from the victim/animal/plant. To a person or pokemon this would feel like a butterfly needle, a small prick easy to overlook but just as if not more annoying that a mosquito bite. The more often the zubat feed the stronger they get and eventually gain the capability of biting, tearing, or pummeling the victim into submission in the aims of devouring it: especially as a collective swarm.  This wasn't always the case though. Back before the pokemon league the zubats were restricted to a small isolated region until they needed to introduce a direct path between the towns for the new gym. Once they demo'd that cave the zubats who were passive died, and the others who boldy fed on humans in a ninja/silent mosquito-esc manner lived on bred and mass and followed the pokemon trainers and fed on all of the weak/dead (""fainted"") pokemon and especially on their trainers (isolated/asleep/etc). Now it should be noted that the reason there are so many zubat is this: What eats Zubat? The answer is nothing, they are poisonous and anything that tries either dies or gets really sick.
But in the game zubat are really weak and easy to kill, yes because you have a pokemon and you are fighting ONE zubat at a time. By itself (especially) low level, but in real life they travel in swarms, and so thousands of zubat bites would probably cause you bleed to death.

At the end of the day the new routes made from the advent of the pokemon league released the hyperinvasive zubat to slowly but surely cover the globe. Food for thought: Zubat wasn't the only bat pokemon, it was the only ""poisonous"" bat pokemon (Thats i know of). Thus, when push came to shove and it came down to the different bats eating one another, zubats one because they are toxic.

Short Short Short version recap: Zubat has been in almost every region, and for those exceptions they started showing up in the sequals game/version of that region. The reason is route development drove it out of its isolated habitat, nothing wants to eat it, but pokemon trainers are basically a walking buffet that leaves you free meals wherever they go. Why wouldn't they follow pokemon trainers? Where the pokemon trainers are zubats will follow, and if they aren't there yet, be patient they are on their way. ;)",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_19iviu,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/19iviu/the_real_reason_why_there_are_so_many_zubats/,

Also it is mentioned that the father himself was a Pokemon trainer just like Ash. This leads me to believe that Ash's dad is a Pokemon league champion, like Drake in the Orange Islands. 

For starter, the champion is never allowed to leave that area because they're always awaiting new challenger and have to be ready to battle them at all times. When they aren't, they are training.

Ash lives in a very small town that is out of the way, also the reason why Oak lives there.

Ash never mentions him, probably afraid that people will insult him for not being the same talented trainer as his father or he hates how people talk about how much they ""love his dad.""

This is also the reason that Ash wants to be a Pokemon Master, to surpass his dad's greatness.

Here's the twist though, Professor Oak HATES Ash's dad, because he killed his son (Gary's dad, another person never mentioned throughout the series) in a battle by accident. Professor Oak never forgave him and plotted revenge, starting with his child. 

The purpose of Ash was to be a trainer greater than his dad. That is why Ash gets his own ""special"" Pokemon even though all the starters were taken. Oak uses Gary to motivate Ash and is the backup plan if Ash doesn't succeed in the plan. 

The plan is to get Ash to kill his own father in a battle, as Ash's dad did to Gary's. Ash only has vague memories of his father, for his father hasn't returned home for years, but keeps in contact with Ash's mom. Oak sends Ash on Pokemon journeys in each different region, waiting to decide when the time is right to kill Ash's dad. Professor Oak will do this by convincing Ash that his father is some villain like a leader of an evil organization. 

If this all fails, Gary Oak will surely be ready, training to be great, ready to avenge the Oak family name. He knows of the plan, which is why he acts like a dick to Ash all the time, but is willing to help out. Even going as far as acting kind to Ash.

This lock is designed to be easy to enter but slightly more difficult to exit, like the mesh exterminators use on houses with bat problems.

When a trainer grabs a ball from their bag and opens it, they open the first seal on the lock. Once the pokemon is inside, its DNA opens the second seal. This forms a genetic bond between the trainer and the pokemon, but if the pokemon manages to escape the ball it is rendered useless because it will only match the DNA of that specific pokemon.

Now, following that logic, the ball would only perform its job if both of the genetic seals were in working condition. This would explain why a pokemon who has fainted can return to their pokeball; because the lock recognizes that the pokemon is still alive, just unconscious. Should one of the seals break, both parts of the lock would spring open and the pokemon would be able to escape. In the same way, if the pokemon were to die inside the pokeball for any reason, it would set off an alarm to notify the trainer.

I fleshed it out a bit more though, and it's radically different now, in that it actually is a more coherent, thought-out theory.

The Mew-Arceus issue arises from the idea that Mew created all Pokemon and the idea that Arceus created the Universe. You probably know it, but in essence it is essentially a bit of self-contradicting canon. We have both of these ""facts"", and they can't possibly co-exist. Or can they?

So, the Universe starts with Arceus creating the Universe. He makes time, he makes space, and somewhere or another in all of this life begins. Mew included. Mew is the origin Pokemon, the first Pokemon in fact. 

""But what about Arceus and such?"" you ask. 

Well, here's my solution. 

Mew creates Pokemon as time passes, in batches. This also explains the sudden appearance of new Pokemon. If we assume that Mew creates new Pokemon as Mew sees fit, it could literally just create 150 new Pokemon whenever it wanted. 

So the Universe continues doing stuff, Mew fills the world with life, Arceus grows older and so do the other Pokegods. Mew, as it grows older and wiser, makes better and better Pokemon. It can make stronger Pokemon and such.  Thus why more legendary Pokemon are in later generations, Mew knows what to do better.

Eventually, the Universe begins to die. Entropy continues going, Arceus himself is dying. Palkia and Dialga are in their death throes.

Mew sees this.

Mew creates Arceus, Palkia, and Dialga, as eggs. Celebi, the time traveling Pokemon, is able to transport these new Pokemon backwards in time to the start of everything. This final burst of energy leads to the Universe finally collapsing, and Celebi transports them to the past before the Universe. This sparks everything as Arceus appears, moments later Palkia and Dialga appear. This appears to Arceus as creating them.  Somehow in all of this Giratina pops in.

Mew is, once more, created during that all. (Alternatively, Mew is sent back to this point to start everything again).

So Mew creates Arceus, Palkia, and Dialga as the ""final Pokemon"" and sends them to start the Universe using Celebi, as the Universe dies.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1a6spp,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1a6spp/mew_and_arceus_can_coexist/,

This explains Mr. Mime even though there are female ones (Oak didn't know about genders. Genders was discovered in Johto, as I explained in a previous post, who are much more conscious about science. Also since discovering breeding, they obviously had to discover gender.)

Grovyle learns Leaf Blade at level 29. But, how do you figure out that it's a grass type move? 
My theory is that to determine names and types, Pokemon researchers undergo thousands of tests a day to determine move types, and giving them appropriate names regarding their type and what it looks like.
Let's say a Venusaur and a Blastoise are battling, and Venusaur uses Vine Whip. Researchers see that Blastoise is weakened largely by Vine Whip, where Tackle didn't do as much damage at all. It is then they discovered Super Effective, Normally Effective, and Not Very Effective. 
Using that knowledge, they say Vine Whip Super Effects all water and ground type Pokemon it was put up against, so they called it a grass move and named it Vine Whip for obvious reasons. 
They did this with every single other move to determine types and names, and now we know why Iron Tail isn't ground type, or Bubble isn't fire.

Silver: A new thought ,100,25,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/updyn/red_on_mt_silver_a_new_thought/,"So in Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal, at the end you face Red up at the top of Mt. Silver, now most conspiracy theories is that he is dead and is waiting for a more powerful trainer (you) to finally let him rest in peace because, well he doesn't say anything...

Well what if that Red is actually from the past , who traveled to the future using a time machine made by Bill?

Now let me explain, in Gold/Silver/Crystal, Bill invents a time machine, so that you can go back and trade/battle pokemon. Though he says it still has some bugs in it, so don't use it, till tomorrow. Now say that after Red becomes Champion, Bill calls him up saying that he created something that can allow him to travel to the future so that Red doesn't have to wait to battle stronger trainers.  Red come over to Bill's house and becomes a test dummy for Bill's time machine. It some what works, but because of the bugs that was in the machine at the time, Red is not able speak and the only way he can return to his current time, is if all of his pokemon in his party faints. Of course  future Bill figures this out and tells Red saying that all he has to do to return to the past is not order his pokemon to attack and for them to faint. Red refuses Bill's suggestion, and both of them set off to tell Prof. Oak what happened to him. Now Red, in the past, has been gone for about three years, so Oak is surprised to see him with Bill. After a quick explanation Prof. Oak tells Red that Mt. Silver in Johto is a place where only the strongest of trainers are allowed to go. So Red sets off for Mt. Silver, while Bill travels with him, so he can see his family. Now Red and Bill split ways once getting to Goldenrod City. Bill manages to solve all the problems with the time machines, and Red waits atop Mt. Silver for a trainer that can beat him. That is why Red doesn't speak to you and after you defeat him, he disappears. You sent him back to his time, and Red is happy that there is/will be stronger than him in the near future. 

**Recap**:Red that is on Mt. Silver, is actually from three years in the past, due to the bugs in Bill's time machine he is unable to speak and return to his time till all of his pokemon faint. Due to Red's pride, he wants a trainer stronger than him to defeat him, so Prof. Oak sends him to Mt. Silver to wait for that one trainer. Prof. Oak sees you and recognizes your true potential and allows you to Mt. Silver, to face Red and send him back to the time he belong in.

If you speak with a Glalie on your team when their health is low, they say that they will melt soon. I presume that when a wild Glalie gets older, they slowly move down to warmer habitats, as they will not be able to withstand the cold. As they move to warmer habitats, they begin to melt. Eventually they move to the ocean, as they realize it is their time. Their ice shell melts, and what's left of the Glalie (Basically a rock with horns and a face) slowly sinks to the bottom of the sea.

At the bottom of the sea, Shellder's thrive. They usually eat their main food source, however, the odd one will eat the melted Glalie. This is where another spin-off theory comes in- The center of Glalie has the powers of a water stone, thus causing the Shellder that ingests it to evolve into Cloyster, which is pretty much a Glalie-Shellder hybrid.

To back this theory up, I found similarities in appearance as well as other facts.
First similarity is the face. The only part shown is the eyes and mouth, and both look similar. 

They have the same body style.

Minus their shells, they have the same appearance.

They are the same height (4'11"")

The horns. Glalie's black horns are in roughly the same place as Cloyster's 
spikes that protrude from the top of his shell.

Glalie lives in caves, while Cloyster lives deep in the sea. Both dark places.

Both are ice types.

Both are unable to be found without trading or evolving, the exception being Cloyster in B&amp;W.

So, what do you think? Solid theory, or complete shot in the dark? Feedback is appreciated!

I might have got some information wrong as I don't like using Game Sharks and the like, but here goes anyway.

Since Gen III, the Pokemon games have been designed so that using certain cheat device codes which damage or change the checksum of the game will make you automatically receive an egg, which is titled Bad Egg. From what I've heard, hatching it can have very harmful effects, such as freezing the game and even deleting the save file altogether.

In Gen IV, you can read all about myths and legends of the world in Canalave City's Library. It is said The Original One (Arceus) was born from an egg in a vortex of pure chaos before the universe existed. But who's to say the current universe is the only one to have ever existed?

What if Bad Eggs are actually Arceus eggs and his/her way of recreating the universe after serious harm has been caused to it? For using cheat devices, the balance of the universe is disrupted, thus a ""vortex of chaos"" is created. Arceus has no choice but to punish the player and reset the universe to how it was by planting itself as an egg in his or her collection of Pokemon. When Arceus hatches from it, it then destroys the ""universe"" by deleting the save file, forcing the player to start a new game, which takes place in the new version of the universe Arceus created.

Sorry for this has been thought of before elsewhere, but I searched and couldn't find anything about it. Perhaps I've been reading too many creepypastas to think this sort of thing up. Regardless, I hope you found it an interesting read.

From what I've played of Black &amp; White and from what I've seen of the few pokemon that they have started to unveil for X &amp; Y there are few key concepts that are popping up rather regularly related to story/plot, themes and and other subtle nuances.

**However**, the most subtle of these is that GameFreak is essentially **""rebooting""** the franchise in a very sneaky *yet* apprecietable way.  Though it woul be impossible toentirely reboot the franchise, they make notions for having that general train of thought.  The purpose for which be to entice new gamers to join.  They do this by effectively creating homages towards the previous generations, pecifically Gen I &amp; II. These are the ways that they accomplish this:

***
1. **A NEW BEGINNING.**  With Gen V, they made a very conscious decision of having an exclusively new gen pokedex, which should immediately be identified by fans as a sign of GameFreak attempting as close as they can to fresh start, with some new ideas and paths of development. Not to mention this is also the first game to not take place in the islands of Japan.

2. **CLONED POKEMON.** There are so many pokemon that GameFreak introduced in Black &amp; White that many fans are furious about how they are not evolved form of previous pokemon. The most blatant of which is how Ludisc and Alomomola are not related. Additionally, how Tauros and Bouffalant are not related.  I view this as not a ""violation of fans expectation"" but rather GameFreak pairing familiarity with these new pokemon expecting to entice a sense of subconscious nostalgia from longtime fans. This also lends a hand to reasoning about why they make a new ""pikachu"" resembling pokemon each generation (this includes the ""early bird"", ""early bug"" and ""four legged dog/cat"" type pokemon iterations)

3. **REPEATED FAMILY ROLES.**  For years pokemon trainers everywhere have been travelling through various terrains of not only forests, roads and seas but have also been required to travel through the perilous mountains of wild zubats and geodudes through every generation. **Unitl Gen V.** Where instead you get woobats and roggenrolas. If GameFreak was so keen to introduce Black and White as a brand new experience, why not change the formula of consistent run-ins with repeating pokemon archetypes. **Because it acts as an homage**. zubat-&gt; woobat. geodude-&gt; roggenerola. hitmonlee/hitmonchan-&gt; sawk/throh. poliwag-&gt; tympole. *etc*. (for the Gen VI savvy ^aka ^spoiler : scatterbug-&gt; caterpie)

4. *(spoiler-ish if you care)* **THE ^CURRENTLY ^KNOWN RELATIONS BETWEEN GEN V &amp; VI IN COMPARISON TO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GEN I &amp; II.** So, ya. In Gen II, they introduced new types, new evolutions/pre-evolutions, and new evolution mechanics. And so far in Gen VI we have seen a new type (Fairy), new evolutions (Sylveon), and new ^yet ^to ^be ^confirmed evolution methods.

So, ya.  I hope that this is as interesting to you guys as it is to me. I also hope the things I say aren't *too* obvious but rather eye-opening.

Please take your time and complete it. I would like to think this theory is quite sound.**


Porygon family, artificial pokemon designed to cross over freely in cyber space (pokedex entry), with subsequent evolutions designed to test space exploration and alien dimensions, respectively.


Know where I'm going with this?


While Pokemon scientists were designing the Poke Transfer system and the storage system, they came upon a dilemma. What are we going to use as a test experiment other than Pokemon? This obviously goes into ethical implications.


Therefore, scientists got together and created Porygon, a pokemon with only basic motor functions, the first artificial pokemon ever. It is technically a programming code, hence graying out the ethical areas of the experiment for pokemon transfer, since it is designed to do exactly that - to travel between cyber space and real life.


So, now we can say with certainty on how pokeballs work. Pokeballs are devices that transfer Pokemon into data, much like how Porygon is. By creating Porygon as simple programming which lies in cyberspace, they gradually added complexities, to simulate a real pokemon. At the same time, by studying said complexities, scientists are able to access data as to how to transfer living beings into data. A cross research between Pokemon storage system and Porygon, if you will.


Pokemon in storage are then kept in cyberspace simulating their natural environment. Data with sentience will require a cyberspace simulating that appeals to their sentience - an artificial environment. Which is again, one of Porygon's main functions, to test the simulated cyberspace environments for Pokemon.

And the man who completed the data transfer machine, was undoubtedly Bill.


(Gen i of storyline completed.)


Now, we move on to the rest of the evolution family. Porygon2, designed to travel into space. It may be possible with the introduction of Pokemon Storage system, pokemon training has seen a huge boom, thereby increasing the need for storage space. 


As the training boom grew exponentially, scientists begin to wonder how to create storage without harming the natural environment. 


The solution - space. This is where Porygon2 comes in. However, halfway through the design and research phase, it is realised it is just too costly (or harms the environment too much for the whole research to be moot) to set up storage server (if you will) in space, and thereby the plan was scrapped, leaving Porygon2 half completed, thereby leaving Porygon2 unable to fly (pokedex entry). Porygon2 is then released as is for the general public.


With the space exploration plan scrapped, scientists are now in a frantic search for a location to set up storage for the ever increasing boom of pokemon for storage. they are forced to move on to radical plans that do not harm the environment - alien dimensions. Not aliens from outer space aliens, aliens as in unfamiliar dimensions alien.


(Storyline for Gen ii, completed.)


The plan was passed to allow research into this area, and Porygon2 was called into action yet again, being the pokemon to push the digital frontier even further, or even set up storage in these alien dimensions, an environment normal beings are unable to survive in. But with upgrades from Porygon2 to Porygon-Z, it is hoped that it will be able to set up the servers in the alien space, retreating into cyber space if necessary to prevent coding decay.


However, things are not as planned. Constant tweaking of Porygon's base code has altered its coding enough to achieve sentience, which is, of course, an ongoing research in order to more efficiently store pokemon. After achieving sentience, research based on Porygon2 is halted permanently for ethical reasons. However, stubborn scientists looked on for alternative funding, in order to perfect the experiment they have spent their lives on. Thus, creating the Dubious Disk, effectively 'completing' Porygon-Z according to their plans.


(Porygon-Z introduced in gen iv.)


Turns out, said alien dimensions are the realms of Palkia, Dialga and Giratina. The plan is therefore abandoned yet again, for fear of altering these pokemon's natural habitat.


With no other alternative, storage is now stored within buildings, on natural environments that house the least pokemon, and has least impact on pokemon habitats - deserts, uninhabited islands, wastelands.

Maintenance toward these servers brought forth human population into these towns, effectively creating cities (gen v cities near deserts).


(current ending of this story, gen v.)


**TL;DR: Porygon Family is directly involved in pokeball and storage experiments and research.**


extra: porygon is originally found as a prize in team rocket's possession because team rocket has had scientists break the code to prevent duplicates of porygon. A code to prevent porygon duplicates was stated in pokedex entries.


By breaking said code, team rocket is then able to churn out porygon at little to no cost, much like us copying a software. 


the original company hoped to regain their losses in research costs through selling legitimate copies of porygon, which caused a fad, a pokemon collectors edition if you will. but team rocket created duplicates to appeal to those who do not want to pay through the nose for a legitimate copy, and instead are content to test their luck at slot machines to win team rocket's exclusive (albeit mass produced) pokemon.

[Rotom](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/fd/Spr_4d_479.png) is the ghost of a [masquerain](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c0/Spr_5b_284.png)

Now hear me out on this one, we know that a lot of Pokemon have obvious origins for their design as well as we have had some amazing theories for others, the best known being the corrupted Clefable is a Gengar

When I see these two besides each other it becomes fairly obvious that their shapes are extremely similar but it goes beyond that, the face colour of both regular(shown above) and shiny [rotom](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/4/4d/Spr_4d_479_s.png), [masquerain](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/ff/Spr_5b_284_s.png) match up, the wings become the electricity and if you take the two fake eyes of masquerain and put them together you get the shape of Rotoms eyes

Thus when a Masquerain dies under certain situations it will be brought back as a Rotom

 personally I think that it is when it is hit by lightning this quote from the pokedex ""Because it can't fly if its wings get wet, it shelters itself from rain under large trees and eaves."" 

 means that it will be in a place where lighting may strike more likely this explains the electric ability of rotom and it's possession comes about from merely being a poltergeist( A type of ghost known for playing tricks and taking over things)

1341320983.0,75,self.pokemonconspiracies,vz60s,The Great Unifying Theory (it's a long one),92,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vz60s/the_great_unifying_theory_its_a_long_one/,"Okay so here's my attempt at creating a theory that unifies the games and anime (have not studied the manga, but the general consensus is that it is not canon).

Let's begin with the creation of Pokemon. The Pokemon world is a separate universe. It is not Japan after a spot of radiation-induced mutation, that theory is just silly. This universe was created by a pan-dimensional being, Arceus, revered rightly so in the Pokemon universe as a deity. This acceptance of the Pokemon universe being more akin to the abrahamic genesis take on reality allows for us to understand why Pokemon do not adhere to darwinian laws of evolution and why many defy what we know as the laws of nature in our own universe. Pokemon were created in their current forms, with set methods of growing (a Pokemon evolving is more like a larval animal evolving into an adult animal as opposed to it becoming a different species). Non-Pokemon creatures, such as humans, fish, mongooses, lions etc, could have been bought into being by Arceus, who had seen these creatures in our reality. If Mew is indeed the common ancestor of all Pokemon, then Mew posses the genetic material to produce all know types of Pokemon that cannot be granted deification, such as the lords of the sea, land, air, dimensions. These Pokemon are presumably descended from Arceus, but gods in their own right, much like the Greek or Norse gods.

Next we have the history of Pokemon. Before Apricorns were utilised as a storage method for Pokemon, humans likely befriended Pokemon in the same way we befriended wild wolves. They would form an attachment to their human, who they would bond for life with. This lends credence to Pokemon Conquest being more canon than previously thought, as this was likely how Neolithic through to Feudal humans domesticated Pokemon, and then came the poke balls with technological advances, allowing humans multiple bonds with Pokemon that could all remain on the human's person, hence why leaving your Pokemon in the PC causes your bind with them to wither.

Now we come to the hotly debated issue of the Pokemon war, and with it, the issue of Pokeworld geography. I suspect there have been multiple conflicts involving Pokemon, on all scales, since Arceus created the world. The first people to domesticate Pokemon, due to their elemental powers, would have likely become the first major despots and warlords. But as the practice of domesticating and discover new and more powerful kinds of Pokemon became more widespread, the use of Pokemon as a form of dominance became more contested.what began as small tribal conflicts over land, resources or just humanities own reasons, grew with populations to become large-scale, perhaps more recently in terms of the games, global conflicts. The Pokeworld is likely a planet, most regions being closer together, but Unova (being the only region with no Pokemon from any other region in it) being further away. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh and the surrounding islands will be refered to as the East, Unova and Orre as the west. This suggests that Lt. Surge was from the West, and likely defected to the East or moved there once relieved from conscription, but is nonetheless proud of the strength that fighting for the west gave him. Unova is perhaps the most prosperous region, almost definitely in the west, due to it having the largest cities. I see Orre as Pokeworld's Afghanistan. Pokemon products are what the Pokeworld's economy thrives on. Pokemon can be purchased or won in casinos. What would be a great way for Unova corporations to make money? New Pokemon. Unova's government is obviously, like modern day America, heavily influenced by corporations (Castellia, the capital, being a huge corporate hub). Orre was likely an mpoverished region, due to its climate, and thus the Unova corporations funded terrorist sects such as Snagem to obtain pokemn non-indigenous to the West. This also explains Team Rocket, who's aim, like Snagem's, but unlike Aqua/Magma/galactic, is to steal Pokemon. Why steal Pokemon from Kanto? They are easier to obtain from the wild. because they are being exported to the West. Hence why Giovanni is the only Italian-influenced character in the East, he is from the West, funded by Unova's corporations. Due to Snagem residing in their own desoltae territory, it seems as if this was the location of the Pokemon war. The East fought back against the terrorists stealing their Pokemon by invading Orre. Unova, to protect their corporate interests, funded Snagem and supplied its own troops (possibly conscripted) to fight the East. The desolate Orre became a wasteland, devoid of all wild Pokemon native to the region, and assumingly the almost complete destruction of Snagem ended the war, West realising that the East could be a source of new Pokemon in times of peace, through trade, which was far less costly than the proxy Orre War.

Finally, the role of the playable characters. Red, Gold, Brandon/May etc are the Pokeworld's equivalent to the Demi-god heroes of ancient Greece and Rome. All except Brandon/May have no father, only a mother who is well provided for regardless of an apparent lack of a job. And Brandon/May look absolutely nothing like their father, Brandon in particular due to his white hair. And explanation for you character is: you are the direct descendant or Arceus, in a Jesus/Heracles fashion. This is why you alone can master the Legendary Pokemon who are unibtainable by all other humans. These Sons of Arceus share a bond, their Pokemon can be transported to each other to aid each other in their journies. Their bonds with their Pokemon are stronger than that of other trainers because they share an essence with the being that created all Pokemon, and are loved/catered for by most humans because they share and essence with the creator of all humans. Every one is a hero, modern legends, which is why Pokemon is such a vibrant and fantastic universe.

Praise be to Arceus, hope you all have a great day and thanks for reading my ramblings.
Criticisms most heartily welcomed!

TL;DR - Pokemon is another universe, more like a biblical universe. You are a demigod. The pokemon war was Afghanistan+Vietnam. There is a Pokemon East/West divide similar to our own.

The original Gengars were experiments from when they tried to use Sabrina to copy Clefable, and thats why Haunters, when they evolve, take that from.

Red's from the middle of no-where. The only reason Pallet Town is conceivably on the map is because Professor Oak lives there. The town's more of a recently started settlement than a town. So Red and Green/Blue, whatever your preference, start their journey. Well, who cares? They're just some kids from Pallet, what're they gonna do?

But then that quiet one in the hat boots Team Rocket from Mt. Moon. He starts getting badges rather quickly, makes friends with some pretty famous people, like Bill. Hell, he's stopping some mafia group before anyone else even realizes they're there. This kid is something different.

He takes down Koga, Sabrina, Blaine, fights Giovanni so many times that the guy straight up takes off. Red just took down an entire criminal organization with a Pikachu and swept the gym leaders like they were a bunch of Sudowoodo during a flood. This kid's great. Pallet Town's known for being Red and Green's town, now. 

So Red makes it through Victory Road without breaking a sweat, trailing behind his rival just enough to give Green the chance to take the title. Everyone's in love with this idea of a rivalry, now, because of these two. They're waiting in anticipation for the kid in the red cap to duke it out with the professor's grandson.

Venusaur and Pikachu beat Lorelei, Charizard and Blastoise beat Bruno, Snorlax beats Agatha, and Lapras takes care of Lance's dragons. Everyone's waiting in bated breath as he heals his pokemon up and takes the walk to the champion's room, only for him to blink in surprise because, lookit that, Green's the champion.

So Red wins anyway.

The spunky mute kid from that little blip on the map finally did it, he's the champion. Kanto's favorite underdog is the best of the best, probably even better than everyone in the other regions too, he's so good. So the moment he steps out of the league, rambunctious grin on his face, bravado radiating, the media swarms him.

Everywhere he goes, there's guys with cameras, guys with questions, everyone wants his autograph. He can't even go home without the paparazzi stalking him. So maybe he visits Johto.

Oh, nope, too bad, they share the same league. Well, hey, maybe there's Hoenn, Sinnoh? Nah, he's made a big enough buzz in two whole regions that the others caught on. Even Unova, who's usually too far away from the others that they don't get the same crazes.

So what to do? There's no-where he can run, no-where to hide. He's ruining his little town with all the media hounds camping there. But Professor Oak decides to throw the kid a bone, his special little prodigy. He tells him of Mt. Silver, the most dangerous peak in the world, as currently recorded. The dividing line between Kanto and Johto. If the media can follow him there, he's not safe anywhere.

So he waits at the top. It's cold, of course. He fashions himself a little cave, makes his own hot spring, and gets used to the temperature. Eventually he makes a stairway on his favorite rock spire.

And he waits.

Johto's attacked by Team Rocket, Hoenn's environment is thrown for a loop, Sinnoh's nearly sucked into a pocket dimension, Unova's attacked by PETA, and then nearly frozen over. More young upstarts from small towns make the headlines. So Red decides, ""hey, now is as good a time as any.""

The Pokemon World Tournament comes up, he joins that, and maybe his life settles down finally.

Our second, more realistic idea was that when a Pokemon uses disable, they are reaching into the mind of the targetted Pokemon, finding the most recently used move and deleting it from their memory. We couldn't figure out why this would only be a temporary effect, but it would explain why disable is learned by Pokemon like Alakazam and Hypno.

Now, it is quite possible that some do in fact either grow up with one as a pet, have them passed down, or wildly throw pokeballs at local mons to get their first, I have another idea. Namely, that breeders sell Pokemon. A breeder will either breed a specific order for a mon (nature, moveset, etc.) or allow for the rookie to pick from a ""stock"" of generically bred mons. This stock would be decided on by looking at popular sales trends and what mons are just generally sought after.

 Rather than just breeding mons for themselves to battle with, they are also battling with them to show off their wares. If a kid sees a little charmander with a cool move such as dragon pulse battling, he/she will most likely get excited and beg his parents for one at some point. 

This also explains why they usually only have a small amount of mons, as they will only take the cream of the crop to show off in public, while leaving the less-admirable/desirable back at the shop.

Two other facts to keep in mind are that, 1. Giovanni is a bad dude who wants the strongest Pokemon possible 2. He has resorted to experimentation in the past in order to achieve that goal (ex. Mewtwo). And obviously giant Pokemon would go a long way to furthering Team Rocket's goals, so could the Pokemon at the lighthouse have been a experiment that escaped after it was created?

1347329755.0,71,self.pokemonconspiracies,zoqtk,"You could listen to Sinnoh myths claiming how Arceus ""created everything"", or you could believe the Silph Co. scientists.",113,42,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/zoqtk/you_could_listen_to_sinnoh_myths_claiming_how/,"A recent report by certain Silph Co. scientists claim that the Arceus did **NOT** in fact create Pokemon-billions of years of evolution did. Arceus is just one pokemon on the brink of extinction with a superiority complex.

Let us start from the beginning, shall we?


Scientists-nor we, really-do know how the universe came to be. However, when there was nothing, something happened that made just two small atoms to create an Explosion, creating a mass amount of dark energy to hurl through the universe. This dark energy somehow formed planets, galaxys, stars, and black holes. **We see this move used day to day-Explosion.** 
Scientists also believe that this dark energy is limited, and once it runs out everything will cease to exist. This dark energy is only created in the original explosion used by few atoms during the creation of the universe. **The pokemon move Explosion mimics this creation of dark energy, yet it can not create the dark energy that is already created in that spot.** It is believed that everything that has the ability to be uses a certain amount of dark energy. Once the explosion at the center of the universe stops, the universe will stop expanding and stop spreading dark energy into places that has no dark energy. **Conclusion: The pokemon move ""Explosion"" is a mimic of what happened billions of years ago at the center of the universe. A creation of another universe doesn't happen every time a pokemon uses explosion because it doesn't have the ability to spread Dark Energy through a place where dark energy is already.**



Fast forward billions of years-the earth as we know it is being formed. Bacteria has reached earth, growing at a slow but steady pace. Bacteria lasts throughout the universe, and a group of bacteria different from the ones found on earth fall off the moon when it becomes a satellite our planet. **This bacteria is a form of the virus we know today as Pokerus.** This bacteria helps speed up evolution in some of the mammals once a form of this bacteria finally evolved into Pokerus (as does Pokerus in the games today), eventually creating the first ""Pokemon""-a more gorilla-like Mew. **Thanks to the Pokerus virus, evolution was sped up in certain bacteria to create the first Pokemon before the first human** Mew looks different today then he did so many years ago, as gradual evolution is what made him adapt to his society. Needless to say, mew eventually found a way to create many of the ancient pokemon (much more primitive then their forms, as kabuto looked much different millions of years ago then he does ""now"").
We cannot forget about the bacteria now know as a form of Pokerus, however. After eventually a form of this bacteria turned into the Pokerus, the virus was able to make itself stronger then the bacteria. This bacteria eventually all died out-except for one. This one bacteria adapted so it could survive the pokerus trying to take it over. It took millions of years for this bacteria to fully adapt, but this one last bacteria, able to control certain pokerus that it had to take over to adapt, is still around today-and very powerful. **This bacteria is known today as Deoxys, a very hostile pokemon, due to the fact that it spent millions of years learning to adapt by being ruthless, which is the only thing it knows now.** Evidence given to scientists that Deoxys is apart of a Pokerus that never goes away is that it can change its speed, defense, and attack whenever it wants to, possibly a mutation of the Pokerus.



Now one can believe that Sinnoh myths are factual with no real scientific evidence, or one can believe a theory supported greatly by the scientific world. Arceus is from a breed of Pokemon scared of the outside world-a group of Pokemon that is so isolated that the existence of them is barely documented. Arceus, the Pokemon born with a mutation different from the other in his group, don't follow the rest in his small Pokemon and go explore (being so isolated, his group of Pokemon could not survive when other Pokemon attacked, as they did not know what to do.) and found a primitive group of people writing down what you today know as the ""Sinnoh myths"". The group of primitive people did not know this pokemon Arceus was, so they made him their god. **Due to the small group of people claiming Arceus to be a ""Poke-god"", many people believe that he is, in fact, the creator of the universe.""** He himself believed this, too, after not experiencing anything else besides his own group. He was ignorant. This ignorance is what helped create his superiority complex.



Arcues eventually found his true power as a pokemon and followed what people were telling him what he did, turning himself into a god. Due to a form of the Pokerus virus he found a way to control certain dark energy around him to manipulate the minds of people. **Because of people telling him of his awesome might and his ability to practice psychic power, Arcues eventually made himself believe he was the creator of all Pokemon.** Although he has the ability to manipulate dark energy (like Palkia, Giratina and Dialga do, but there are many different theorys on how and why they can) which is a nearly impossible thing to do without a certain mutation, he is not a Poke-god, **yet a Pokemon from an extinct group of Pokemon who has made himself believe that he is a Poke-god.**",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_zoqtk,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/zoqtk/you_could_listen_to_sinnoh_myths_claiming_how/,

What if the Pokemon world (in the games, at least) is a working example of some form of communism? Bear with me. This may have already been discussed, if so, I'm sorry. Also, not really a conspiracy. Whatevs. Throwing it out there anyway.

First off, the battles. Clearly, trainers are required to pay out money when they lose. Even Team Rocket. (Perhaps the consequences of not paying are harsh?) This creates a working economy of sorts. Win more battles, make more money. Therefore, anyone can make money.

On to Pokemarts. Assuming that human food can be found at marts, marts are another form of money flow and are the main sale of goods. I think it's safe to assume that, with Pokemon battles being the prime form of cash flow, marts make quite a bit of money from people needing Pokeballs, potions, etc., along with human food. I theorize that, in order to maintain steady prices and free health care for Pokemon, the invisible government has to tax the heck out of the marts and leave enough for the clerks to live comfortably.

Which then leads me to that free healthcare. In order to maintain the supplies and staff, the government taxes the marts to supply both, implying that the government builds and maintains a standard. Why else does every Pokemon Center across a region look the same? 

Taxing the marts alone is probably not enough to maintain so much, though, right? Right. However, what if the Gyms and the Elite Four are also regulated and run by the government? The gov't supplies a (presumably sizable) paycheck to gym leaders/trainers and the members of the E4, who in turn make money for the government by giving them all their battle winnings. I think it's safe to assume that people would aim to be a part of the E4 to gain riches and fame, and since anyone can be a Pokemon trainer, this goal seems very attainable. What I'm getting at is that the gyms and the Elite Four must get a lot of challenges and must send a lot of those challenges packing.

I'll also point out the various power plants and mines across the games. They more than likely would be government-run so that the gov't can then seize the assets and distribute them to whatever they feel needs the help; most likely the majority of the the energy would be sent straight to the Pokemon Centers, since the nurses seem to use some sort of energy to heal your Pokemon.  

The game corners (before HG/SS, that is) would also be easily run by the government. Money is traded for coins. All the money (except that to maintain the facility and the staff) is sent to the government. And the people of the Pokemon world seem like they have a serious gambling problem, so this would be a very substantial source of income.

Housing would presumably be government-supplied. I have nothing else about that...

In my opinion, what throws this theory off is the huge city in Unova. Castelia, I think? Not sure. 

Maybe communism isn't the right word. I'm not an economics major. However, this all fit together so well in my head that I just had to share it.

**TL;DR: Everything in the Pokemon world is tightly controlled by the government. Battles create sustainable cash flow, marts and pokecenters keep the battles going, elite four/gyms and resource collection keep the pokecenters going.**",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1343904736.0,,,True,t3_xk2hv,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/xk2hv/the_pokeconomy/,

Team Rocket members are stationed nearly everywhere inside the building, and your rival alludes to you that he had no problem with the Team Rocket members because of his relations to his father. This may agree with the idea that Giovanni (the leader of Team Rocket) is your rival's father because he didn't seem to fight any Team Rocket members that you are forced to.

After you defeat Giovanni, the final gym leader, he disappears saying that his defeat has shown him to continue training and to disband Team Rocket. However, the only person you know who also got all 8 badges is your rival, so this alludes to the idea that either your rival had a friendly father-son match in which your rival won, something that most parents would be proud of, or Giovanni merely gave his son the Earthbadge.

Pokemon X &amp; Y seems to refer to the X and Y chromosomes (male and female). The X legendary, Xerneas, is more feminine looking than the Y legendary, Yveltal. In genetics, the X chromosome is the main one. XX is female, and XY is male (thus, X is the core genetic code and Y is a male mutation, in a way).

I predict that Xerneas and Yveltal are going to be credited in the lore with breeding, genders, or genetics (passing down IVs/natures through breeding, etc.)

As a follower of Shifter25's Ditto theory, I'd like to theorize that Xerneas worked with Mew to create dittos. Mew was the ""base"" and with Xerneas's help, the genetic base became alterable. It is because of Xerneas that a ditto is amorphous and can change it's DNA. It will be the legendary of change. Specifically, genetic change.

Then, Yveltal represented a virus, or mutation. This allowed some of the dittos to mutate into male versions of a Pokemon, unless they are non-ditto derived (Legendaries) or based too strongly on something non-natural (a magnet-derived ditto mutation--magnemite--wouldn't be ""natural"" enough to have male and female DNA distinctions)

It is with both Xerneas and Yveltal that Pokemon genetics are variable enough to reproduce without the need for a ditto.

1: Their Movesets seem to imply weaponry. They all learn Explosion, Superpower, Lock-on, Zap Cannon and Hyper Beam. Regirock learns Iron Defense and Registeel learns metal claw. All of these seem kind of militaristic. 
2: Registeel looks a lot like a robot, and is made of a material not found in nature, that humans can't recreate or destroy.

This is probably because evolving them with a stone accelerates their oath into adulthood. For pokemon that evolve normally, they learn more moves at a lower level, and learn moves less frequently as they get higher level. This is reflected in nonpokemon humans as well (outside the games, I mean). The first 3 or so years of your life, you learn the most about the world, and speech, etc. For pokemon, it's probably similar. A charmander (the first starter I had) learns 2 moves by level 5, scratch and growl. By the time it reaches level 10, it has learned another two moves: Ember and smokescreen. but then it doesn't learn another move (dragon rage) until level sixteen, by which point it is already a charmeleon, and thus doesn't learn the move until later. This is because it has grown up slightly and learns at a slower rate. Now for some stone evolution. I'll be using Pikachu as an example. Pikachu doesn't have great stats, but if you level it up enough it eventually learns some amazing moves, such as thunder. Raichu, however, learns no moves naturally but has greatly increased stats. This is because pikachu is the child form of Raichu, and until it has learned its last move, Thunder, at level 50, it is not truly ready to go into adulthood.

That got me thinking of maybe a more realistic solution (not that the theory wasn't well thought out or anything): tourism. So, my basic theory is that in Kanto, we see no Mons from other gens because no one wants to visit Kanto. The only people interested in going there are the occasional kid from Johto who would treat it as more of a brief holiday, maybe go shopping, whatever. Other than that, not very exciting for other regions. Same goes for Johto. Then, in Hoenn, we see more Mons from other regions. This is because people want to go to the more tropical region for vacations and such, as it has a lot of attractions like the battle frontier, warm weather, beaches, etc. Sinnoh is very rich in history and lore, so people go to study the history and such where it actually happened. They go to visit the Snowpoint Temple, the Lakes, and Mt. Coronet. They also want to study the divide that Mt. Coronet created (Shellos &amp; Gastrodon). Then comes Unova, the hotspot for people to visit. It's the most advanced, has many attractions like the world tournament, musicals, pokewood, and the Ferris wheel. This leads to non-native Mons escaping into the wild and populating, hence the increase in non-Unovan Mons in BW2.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_z41vv,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/z41vv/about_the_pokemon_from_different_regions/,

We never expected what would happen. In a year we have gotten over 13,604 subscribers. To think 13,604 unique users have decided to subscribe to /r/pokeconspiracies is crazy, brilliant and all things positive in the world! I didn't want to do just a boring thank you though. I'm going to give a brief synapse of how /r/pokemonconspiracies came to exist. 

I was over in /u/hashp0rridge's (who I now will refer to as Rory) house and we came across this idea of Pokemon conspiracies. We found a huge list of conspiracies and we just discussed them. It was the famous theory, Ash's coma, that got us thinking about posting some on /r/pokemon. I gave a quick search and found zero theories posted in the past. 

Before we knew it we created the subreddit and tried to get it going. This wasn't easy. We posted countless threads of old theories. It was going no where. After a month we had about thirty-forty subs. The enthusiasm was declining. 

We were talking about letting it go when I saw a post in /r/pokemon of a conspiracy. I saw people saying they wanted more of it! I posted a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/rtm0s/another_pokemon_conspiracy_theory/c48lgbp?context=3) advertising the subreddit. This was at 4AM so I decided to head to bed. I woke up to four miss calls from Rory. I rang him and he said something like ''DIGGY (me) WHAT DID YOU DO?'' We had gained about 400 subs in eight hours and were still increasing. 

After a week we'd grown into the high hundreds (Around 800-900 subs). Rory posted in some subreddit for finding mods. Through this we found Ghax (aka /u/pokemonconspiracies). I can tell you right now without this man, this subreddit wouldn't be as well maintained as it is. Ghax is our Batman, our Jesus, our super powerful janitor basically.

By the end of April we were bigger than /r/boobs. You have to understand how crazy this was for two suburban nerdy kids. We flipped our shit. 

We weren't done yet though. We all sent messages to the /r/pokemon mods asking to add us to the sidebar. We'd received no response after a couple of weeks. We grew restless. I submitted a post asking for the mods to stop ignoring us and add us to the sidebar. I asked for our subs to upvote it and send the mods messages. You guys delivered. So epicly. Before 24 hours was up we were added to the sidebar. Now we had a fan base so we decided to work on the sub's image. 

The three mods decided we needed someone who knew CSS to design our subreddit. We got /u/Lunar_Sunrise to work on it. What you see now is similar to the initial design. Rory and Ghax wrote the sidebar. 

There's not much more to it. We brought in /u/daly192 in about May just for a little more mod support. He created the Fiction Conspiracy Network which is still going strong. 

We had a created a new type of sub fandom and that's crazy! So thanks to all of you guys for upvoting posts, leaving comments and just being great theorists. Thanks to Rory, Ghax, Daly, Lunar_Sunrisre and anyone else who helped in anyway at all. You're all great. I've loved being apart of this. This community is fantastic! Just a bunch of people discussing Pokemon. 6 year old Digrish would be so jealous right now.

This brings us to my question, if these ancient pokemon travel in groups, why wouldn't they find and restore to life fossils of not just the basic pokemon, but also the evolved pokemon (ex: tirtouga and carracosta). These pokemon would travel in groups and thus when a cataclysm  or big extinction event happens, they would all for in the same area, so why would they all not be preserved by the same stuff that preserved the original fossil? Thus, basic ancient pokemon and evolved ancient pokemon should be preserved together and be in the same area. Why couldn't the evolved pokemon also be revived?




TL;DR: evolved ancient pokemon should be preserved in the same area as the non evolved ancient pokemon because they travel in groups, so why wouldn't the evolved ancient pokemon be revived as well?

They could just be computer coding.,91,23,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vfxz2/all_captured_pokemon_arent_real_they_could_just/,"So, I have been thinking about how it was possible to keep pokemon in pokeballs, and how you can keep them in PCs and whatnot.  I have come to the conclusion, that when a pokemon is caught, Its body is transferred into genetic code, so It is no longer a creature, but computer coding. When expelled from the pokeball, the coding manufactures the exact pokemon data that was inside the pokeball and shapes it into the world.  This also explains how you can keep them in computers, because they are nothing more than coding. TMs and HMs also work as disks, because they are coding storage devices.  This could also explain why Pikachu doesn't like being in pokeballs, He probably understands he has been captured and is just coding, so essentially when he is in his pokeball he is dead. All pokemon in pokeballs could be dead. Just codes. Pokemon inside the pokeballs are dead, until release, when sent back in they die again.

Sorry if this is really sloppy, I didn't organize it at all, and I only had about 30 seconds to type it because I need to go to school. Also this is just a theory, If evidence proves this is crap then whatever it was fun to think about. This was my first conspiracy.

Edit: We have some haters and arguements out there so I'm updating.


The problem with copying/cloning: In the mewtwo movie, we have pokemon being cloned. They all turned out evil and retarded. Cloning is probably harder than it seems, if it doesn't work there.


The problem with apricots: Apricots were genetically modified to be able to absorb pokemon. There had to have been some technology involved in there somewhere.

Through natural selection and evolution, humans came to be.  Humans were different, as they had a coherent language as opposed to the monsters grunts and screeches.  

Eventually came the idea to capture them.  Some did, some didn't.  Some were able to befriend the creatures, some weren't.  Unfortunately, overwhelmingly, Pokémon attacked humans.  Humans still had a soft spot for the strange elemental creatures they lived with.

 So people decided to put some of their resources into a center for helping heal the angry creatures.  When they get mad and fight, a trainer brings them to a Pokémon Center to heal and spend time socializing with humans like the nurses.  

Once Pokémon centers sprung up, entire towns and cities would grow around them.  What was once huge patches of wilderness with monsters all the way through was now a scatter of villages and hamlets interconnected by rudimentary pathways, and Pokémon are only found between.  When they were hurt, it was easy to rush weakened Pokémon to a PC, because when they were weakened they wouldn't attack humans.

Then humans thought of controlling their powers.  Now that there was infrastructure to heal them easily, without long-term repercussions, they could beat each other senseless without dying.

But they needed more Pokémon Centers to keep up with it...so they started taking fees for ""Trainer Licenses"" and taxing Pokémon-item purchases at Pokémarts, and finally, last but not least, taking a 1/4 of the winnings from every Pokémon battle(you lose half your cash if you lose or forfeit a battle, electronic 3G mumbo-jumbo happens, then money goes to the government, then half of THAT goes to the winner, in a matter of seconds).

Therefore, Pokémon Centers caused a booming economy.  This theory plays well with many other theories, including quite possibly a solution to how they ""rebuilt"" after the great war.  Possibly the Pokémon centers were originally healing centers for the troops?

It is clearly ridiculous that ten-year-olds be entrusted with such a monumental and difficult task.  Nobody has ever given a 10-year-old a notepad and told them to go and document every species of animal in his or her country.  It's ludicrous!

Unless, the task of completing the PokeDex is never actually placed on the child.  People have theorized that this is a way to get kids out into the world and introduce them to science, which is completely plausible, but is detracted by some of the clear folk knowledge stored in the PokeDex.  It's like giving a kid a book of fairy tales, and telling him or her that this is all that is needed to explain life **PLEASE DO NOT START AN ATHEIST CIRCLEJERK NEITHER HERE, NOR LATER ON IN MY THEORY.  I HEREBY RENOUNCE ANY CLAIMS THAT I'M HERE TO START ONE, BUT IT MIGHT GET IFFY**

Now, I don't want to step on any toes, but with how deep the games have been getting into creation stories and PokeMythology, maybe the completion of the PokeDex is comparable to a religion's coming-of-age ritual.  Perhaps, we will be revealed the legendary tale of the hero who went out and documented every living creature in PokeEarth in coming games.  Perhaps this hero is fabled to be around ten-years-old, and this is why ten-year-olds are continually given PokeDexes.  

To expand on the folk knowledge aspect, the hero (we'll call him the Indexer from here on out), could have been from a very long time ago, and documented every Pokemon in a notebook or something.  There wasn't a PokeDex back then, so he inferred all of the PokeDex entries from observation, and not actual scientific data.  This was documented into a child's PokeDex once science revealed more about Pokemon.  It's a way to get children out into the world still, but not necessarily a government ploy to create a generation of scientists.

TL;DR: The PokeDex is a traditional coming-of-age ritual-type thing where children are bascially given a fairy tale book to get them more interested in the world.

I always believed that Pokeballs were like genie lamps. The Pokemon's atoms are rearranged to fit in the ball, and reassemble inside the ball. There, each Pokemon has each environment that would appeal to their type. For example, a bug type would have a forest in there, while a water type would have an ocean or lake. 

Time exists differently in a Pokeball. This is how Pokemon can live for much longer in their ball, without dying. Also, when trainers recall their Pokemon when they are hurt in a battle, it delays any ill effects until they can be taken to a Pokemon centre.

Some Pokemon, like Pikachu, hold a fear of being stuck in their Pokeball, or of the different passage of time, and thus prefer to stay in the outside world.

A small part of the Pokemon is still tuned in to the outside world, so when their trainer calls them into battle, they ready themselves for a fight. They also recognize the call to be returned, and (usually) return to the ball without a fight.

This theory started with some curiosity about what has officially been said about Arceus. As one thing led to the next I discovered I was reading about Mew with more interest. (In case you're interested, I decided the digit-like shape of Arceus makes it look like ""The Hand of God"". Just an fyi)

So at the bottom of bulbapedia's listing for Mew there's this tasty tidbit:

[""Mew is similar to a vertebrate embryo. \[...\] It is purported by scientists to be the ancestor of all other Pokémon, a reference to the recapitulation theory.""](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew)

As a music educator I'd never come across the idea before. So of course, wikipedia gave me a collegiate appropriate crash course in the subject. This is where I discovered this quote and picture:

""Haeckel formulated his theory as ""Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". The notion later became simply known as the recapitulation theory. Ontogeny is the growth (size change) and development (shape change) of an individual organism; phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a species. Haeckel claimed that the development of advanced species passes through stages represented by adult organisms of more primitive species.[7] Otherwise put, each successive stage in the development of an individual represents one of the adult forms that appeared in its evolutionary history."" 

[Related image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Haeckel_drawings.jpg)

Now, while the [recapitulation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory) is neat, I find it all the more appropriate to discuss this embryonic portion.

In brief, recapitulation states that higher forms of life go through development while an embryo that is similar to adult versions of other creatures. (Like a human having gill-like slits at one point in the womb). In the light of evolution - you know, cause that's kind of what Pokemon is all about - this seems like a plausible connection for what Mew is supposed to represent: the first embryo.

""But first time /r/pokemonconspiracies guy, what does this have to do with Ditto?""

That's an excellent question, here's a cookie.

Embryos are developed in fluid, evident in such things as placenta or embryonic fluid in eggs. In the generally accepted Pokemon canon, Arceus created Mew - the Embryo of all Pokemon, with the intention to evolve (see [recapitulation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory)), and given the mammalian-like nature of Mew, it was developed in an embryonic fluid sac. So what happens to this sac of nutrients and evolutionary potential when Mew is developed and set free? It becomes Ditto. As many Ditto as it could pull apart to be, rich with the creative juices (literally) of the recently created Mew. In this way, both the origin of Ditto can be explained and element specific Pokemon, as these Proto-Ditto (I'll call them) became evolutionary-respondent to their surroundings. The follow up to the obvious question: ""Why are there still regular Ditto?"" Well, it's the same argument as ""Why are there fish and tortoises when recapitulation theory suggests those are just forms a higher embryo goes through?"" Something about the original design went ""Right"" along the way and developed into the latest incarnation of what may be a close, but all together different version, of the actual original.


Any way, that's what I managed to come up with on a ""get what you need done work day"".

tl;dr: go [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory), look at [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Haeckel_drawings.jpg), consider that Mew is the first Embryo of all Pokemon and Ditto is the leftover juices of that embryonic sac.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1ezi9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1ezi9c/mew_ditto_ernst_haeckel/,

This idea came to mind when Team Plasma wanted to separate people and Pokémon. Of course it turned out that that wasn't Ghetsis's actual goal, so maybe it's not Team Plasma-related. Anyway:

In the Trading Card Game Islands which is the only region of the world of PCGB we see, you don't see any or hear people talk about any actual Pokémon. This leads me to believe that there *are* no Pokémon in that world, since why would people be battling with Pokémon *cards* when they could use the real thing? Pokémon are incredibly close to humans so if they existed you would at least see one in one of the facilities. I propose that the reason that there is such a focus on card battling in that world is because they need something to fill the void of the battling industry when all the Pokémon disappeared. Cards are easy and cheap to mass-produce, unlike battle simulation suites, and can be traded. The human that was turned into a Pokémon in PMD R/B was from this world. Funny thing is this even fits with the manga *Ginji's Rescue Team* since there are no Pokémon shown in the human world.

In the world of PMD, there are Pokémon which have formed their own society in the absence of humans. There are human ruins and man-made Pokémon, so the splitting must be a copying of the world, or a literal splitting of the planet. Either way, there are *some* humans in the world. One was in the paralyzed future, being you from PMD T/D/S, and one might have been the human who became Gengar from PMD R/B unless he was from before the split.

1352769931.0,62,self.pokemonconspiracies,133hly,The Biology of Pokemon: Chikorita,95,33,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/133hly/the_biology_of_pokemon_chikorita/,"Chikorita

**Reproduction:** A Chikorita has similarities in reproduction with both plants and animals.  Fertilization occurs in one of two ways.  A Chikorita may become impregnated in the same way of a mammal, through internal fertilization with sexual organs.  A Chikorita may also become impregnated in the same way as a plant, pollination.  Two Chikorita's often breed through pollination, as this allows their species to become more diverse, with less effort.  However; other species breeding more often consists of mammalian fertilization.
Upon impregnation, a Chikorita is pregnant for 3-4 weeks. The male digs a hole in the ground; about 4 feet deep, where the female lays her egg.  Within a month, a small leaf can be seen growing out of the ground.  Within 4 months, the baby Chikorita has become fully grown, and a large leaf sticks out of the ground where she was buried.  The mother proceeds to dig around her baby, helping her out of the ground.  At this stage Chikorita is fully matured.

**Growth:** Once the egg is implanted into the ground (a process simply known as implantation) the egg grows roots (similar to a seed).  The roots absorb nutrients from the ground and help the baby to grow inside the egg.  After about 2 weeks the Chikorita begins to crack the egg as it grows bigger, pushing loose dirt aside.  Chikorita continues to grow for about 4 months, at which point it reaches it's adult height of 0.9m and its ideal weight of 6.4kg.

**Natural Moveset:**

* Razor Leaf: A Chikorita's leaf grows at an almost instantaneous rate.  This is so a Chikorita may hide from predators by blending in.  If something were to grab her leaf; the leaf could detach and Chikorita would be able to run without hindrance. If Chikorita were to concentrate energy from her body into her head, she may regrow her leaf in an instant.  Because of this Chikorita has developed a defence mechanism that allows her to throw her leaves at opponent's dealing potentially fatal damage.

* Poison Powder: Small spores begin to grow on Chikorita's leaf.  These spores are highly toxic, and could be deadly to any unwary predator that happens to be looking for a light snack. Chikorita can sprinkle the spores on her opponent; however, it is not as deadly as ingestion of the leaf.

* Synthesis: On top of eating small organisms, a Chikorita develops means to absorb sunlight to convert light into energy (similar to photosynthesis).  Chikorita can use this energy to restore strength in a battle.

* Reflect/Light Screen: Chikorita is able to briefly release a large amount of potential psychic energy.  It is currently unknown why some Pokemon are able to use the psychic ability possessed by all pokemon, some may release a little, some can release all their potential (typically psychic types), some cannot release any.  When a Chikorita releases it's energy an invisible wall forms in front of her, protecting her from any direct physical attacks.

* Magical Leaf: An extension of Chikorita's Razor leaf attack.

* Natural Gift: After ingesting a berry; a Chikorita may use it to fuel an attack based on the type of berry.  This is done through a combination of the berry and the energy absorbed from the sun.

* Sweet Scent: Upon reaching prime breeding age a Chikorita can release a special set of hormones that smell sweet, attracting mates (also attracts bees and other bugs that carry the pollen of other Chikorita), and potentially intoxicating other Pokemon.

* Safe Guard: A Chikorita is able to protect itself from all status ailments using a combination of psychic power and sunlight energy, depending on the ailment.

* Aromatherapy: Like Sweet Scent, Aromatherapy is used to attract mates.  However; it does have special healing properties that cure various status ailments.

* Solar Beam: Solar beam is an extreme buildup of solar energy through photosynthesis. Chikorita releases the energy in a powerful beam of light from her mouth.  This is Chikorita's most powerful defence.

**Bayleef Evolution:** Chikorita's evolution is similar to Bulbasaur.  A large release of stored solar energy stimulates the accelerated growth of Chikorita.  Chikorita grows 0.3m (A foot) and a similar growth occurs in its leaf.  Chikorita's legs become more pronounced and the seeds around her neck grow larger, making it more likely for her to reproduce.

**Meganium Evolution:**  Chikorita's second evolution happens more gradually.  With Bayleef acting as an intermediate.  Bayleef continues to grow as she absorbs sunlight, eventually growing to the size of a Maganium.  The seeds around her neck bloom near the end of her growth, flowering.  Her leaf falls off midway through the evolution, with antennas sprouting and eventually becoming fully formed.  It is suggested that the antennas replace the leaf, as the leaf is no longer a necessary defence. Meganium is near the top of the food chain, becoming a predator as opposed to prey, the antenna increase her field of detection, making it easier to catch her prey.

Enigma Penumbra: I think that the Nidoking/Queen evolution line is related through a common ancestor to the Aggron evolution line. The first two evos are the same size, they are both spiky, they live in different environments which would cause them to adapt differently... Nidoran = Plains; Aron = Mountans


Ristar 600: okay


Enigma Penumbra: type matching wise they seem like rivals, Aggron would prey on nidoran, nidorino, and nidorina (whom because of typing would be unable to defend themselves) and Nidoking/Nidoqueen would protect the young. 4x effectiveness + STAB on Aggron = instakill. Ground type will f*#%s your shit backwards. Also, Nidoqueen would NEVER get pregnant because that would decommision it from its role as protector, while Nidoking wouldn't be bothered by having offspring. Nidoqueen protects the nest, Nidoking goes hunting and competes for territory. They also have rediculous move pools. Both Aggron and Nidoking...


Ristar 600: oh yeah


Enigma Penumbra: The only time they have a size difference is in their final evos by 2 feet... This could be explained simply by their environment. Nidoking needs to be short to hunt in the plains, Aggron needs to be tall and have more reach to live in the mountains.

You might be asking where all this adds up! Well my thought is Metagross is a migratory Pokémon which travels to Sinnoh to either lay eggs or to actually allow the children to hatch. The former seems more appropriate as they probably just up and leave their children to mature for a while. This would also explain why they appear in large clusters.

Once they mature, they probably travel back to Unova to conjoin and become Metang and eventually Metagross. This process is probably very quick as there's no Beldum there, as stated before.

First off, it was officially revealed on Valentine's Day. I wouldn't highlight this fact if it wasn't for Sylveon's design reminding me of Valentine's Day, with the bows and ribbons and the pink colors...doesn't that remind you of all those Valentine's Day cards? 

Second, the region this Pokémon is based on France, home to Paris, the 'City of Love'. This isn't particularly important, but it only adds to my little theory.

Third, and one of the main reasons I'm writing this, is what I think Sylveon's type is: Flying. Before you pass me off as crazy, think of this: have you ever heard of the saying 'Love is in the air'? Well, I think Sylveon is a literal representation of that: a Flying Pokémon that spreads love and affection all around it.

And finally, How would it evolve? Since every new set of Eeveelutions evolves using new methods, I believe Sylveon will evolve by doing something related to the bond system that GameFreak mentioned on their blog [last month](http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=561). I won't go into specifics because I have no idea how this bond system will work.

And those were all of my thoughts on what I think Sylveon will be.

&gt;According to Ace Trainer Beverly, there is a story that states that a legendary Pokémon is said to live in this cave. This legendary Pokémon was training its student Pokémon. However, there is no known legendary Pokémon to be found in Challenger's Cave.

The cave became closed up in Black 2 and White 2. 

I'm also curious about Scorched Slab. 

&gt;Scorched Slab is modeled after one of the real-life locations that is claimed to be Amano-Iwato, the cave where Amaterasu, the sun goddess, shut herself up for a long time in Japanese mythology. This explains why there is nothing to find in Scorched Slab but TM11 (Sunny Day).

EDIT: From Wikipedia's page on Amono Iwato

&gt;Ama-no-Iwato (天岩戸?) literally means ""The cave of the sun god"" or ""heavenly rock cave"". In Japanese mythology, Susanoo, the Japanese god of the seas, was the one who drove Amaterasu into Ame-no-Iwato. This caused the sun to hide for a long period of time.

&gt;In order to get Amaterasu out of the cave the other gods threw a party outside. When she heard the noise she got curious and peeked but got blinded by the mirror Yata no Kagami and so she thought they were celebrating the arrival of an even greater and brighter goddess than herself. Though in reality it was her own mirror image. Then Tajikarao forced the cave to open up the rest and the world was bathed in light once again. As Amaterasu stepped out of the cave a holy seal was applied to it so that she couldn't go back into hiding.

Are there any theories or guesses about this?

The leading scholarly publication for POKEMON Research

Vol. 3 Issue 11

Submitted by Dr. JOSE Garcia

*Dr. Garcia received his PhD in POKEMON Computation under the tutelage of Dr. Satoshi FUJI.  His past research included work on POKEMON cloning technology.  He is an expert on the non-organic POKEMON PORYGON, ELECTRODE, and MAGNETON.*

**Notes On the Behavior of ELECTRODE**

&gt; Introduction

Like the other non-organic POKEMON, the ELECTRODE family have no DNA and thus are not descended from MEW.  ELECTRODE was first observed in the wild 40 years ago, roughly corresponding to SILPH CO's introduction of the POKEBALL.  However, SILPH scientists, myself included, are not aware of any SILPH project concerning the production of an artificial POKEMON besides PORYGON.

My colleague Dr. BILL Tori, founder of BILL's PC Inc, has remarked that ELECTRODE exhibits similarities to artificially intelligent computers and self-replicating robots.  He stated that the Department of Defense's POKEMON Command, headed by Lt. Gen. Joshua 'SURGE' Conway, had explored the possibility before abandoning the project.  BILL strenuously refused to divulge how he knew this and denied having any further knowledge on the subject.  SURGE refused my request for an interview, citing DoD policy.

&gt; Appearance

ELECTRODE's internal power source is unknown, but given its long battery life and tendency to congregate near the POWER PLANT, it must be able to harvest ambient atmospheric electricity to recharge itself.  Due to this, ELECTRODE can be used to power heavy machinery.  It appears that ELECTRODE is so efficient at generating power it is incapable of safely storing this electricity, frequently resulting in an EXPLOSION.

Its outer casing is a lightweight but durable aluminum shell which protects the fragile inner electronics and power unit.  The casing seems to be the same material that POKEBALLs are made from.  If ELECTRODE is in fact an intelligent self-replicating robot, it is possible that ELECTRODE is capable of constructing this shell from materials pilfered from POKEBALL manufacturers.

Its cartoonish grin is not actually a mouth; ELECTRODE has no need to eat.  Rather, the ""grin"" is an access panel through which ELECTRODE may repair its inner components.  There is an audio speaker housed behind this access panel.  ELECTRODE communicate wireless and have no audio receptors, effectively making this POKEMON SOUNDPROOF.  The eyes are capable of showing emotion, and appear to be some sort of LCD monitor display.

&gt; Behavior

ELECTRODE is an enigmatic and volatile POKEMON that evolves from VOLTORB once VOLTORB has built enough components to upgrade its hardware and operating system.  The upgrade replaces VOLTORB's small power unit with ELECTRODE's formidable reactor, which is much heavier and requires a larger casing.  As a result, a new ELECTRODE will have double the radius and six times the weight of VOLTORB.

Similar to MAGNETON, ELECTRODE is capable of levitating and manipulating objects around it through its mastery of quantum electrodynamics.  Thus it has no need for arms or legs.  However, it rarely uses its ability to levitate, preferring instead to use its perfectly spherical body to roll around, which saves energy.

This POKEMON uses both non-lethal and lethal attacks to intimidate and deter enemies.  It emits an ear-splitting SCREECH from its speakers to repel intruders.  A more powerful version of this SCREECH creates a SONICBOOM.  Alternatively, by producing a FLASH or a LIGHTSCREEN, ELECTRODE can temporarily blind predators.  It is even capable of learning how to quantum TELEPORT to escape its enemies.  

To attack, it will CHARGE its internal electrical turbine and unleash a painful SPARK.  It is also capable of immobilizing enemies with THUNDERWAVE and the much more dangerous THUNDERBOLT, THUNDER or ZAP CANNON.  When ELECTRODE gradually accelerates along the ground to great speeds, the resulting ROLLOUT squashes anything foolish enough to stand in the way.  Some of the aforementioned behaviors are only used by ELECTRODE in captivity as they require ELECTRODE to download a TECHNICAL MACHINE.

As a last resort, ELECTRODE may (sometimes accidentally) SELF-DESTRUCT or produce a massive EXPLOSION that destroys everything within a 500 meter radius.  If my hypothesis about ELECTRODE's power source is correct, then this EXPLOSION is probably the result of a reactor overload.  This drastic course of action will not kill ELECTRODE; rather, it is capable of directing the EXPLOSION away from its own body.  In the rare case that the ELECTRODE's casing is stripped off, the ELECTRODE CPU is able to slowly rebuild itself over many weeks or even years.  To date, nobody has observed a ""naked"" ELECTRODE without its casing.

&gt; Editor's Note: 

Following the failed merger of SILPH CO. with TEAM ROCKET, JOSE was laid off by SILPH for assisting ROCKET's takeover bid.  After a 3-year stint as a ROCKET SCIENTIST, he lost his funding for further ELECTRODE research after the collapse of the ROCKET leadership.  He is currently researching a programming upgrade for PORYGON2, which is still in beta testing and will tentatively be called PORYGON-Z.

What would Ethan/Gold's team be?,74,14,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/y8b9y/we_know_reds_team_ingame_what_would_ethangolds/,"So we know Red's team is Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Pikachu, Snorlax and Lapras/Espeon (depending on if it's the original or the remake). So what would Gold's team be?

The starters **Meganium, Typhlosion** and **Feraligatr** would be highly likely choices. That leaves spots for three more. 

I've noticed that if you look at Red's team, they are either starters (including Pikachu) or Pokemon received in-game that aren't received through the usual random encounters. Snorlax has to be woken up, Lapras is received by a guy in Silph and Eevee is received in Celadon Mansion.

So if we look at the Pokemon received through means similar to Snorlax, Eevee and Lapras, we'll be be able to find Pokemon that might make its way on Gold's team.

* **Sudowoodo** - Acts as an obstruction in Route 36. Pretty much like Snorlax's role.
* **Togepi family** - Hatched from an egg received from Elm's aide. I'd say Togepi is one of the most iconic out of the Gen II Pokemon. I just listed the whole family since I didn't know which member to put here: you could go with the final evolution in GSC, the final evolution in HGSS, or the recognizable unevolved form (like Pikachu)
* **Red Gyarados** - Encountered at the Lake of Rage. Also a shiny so that makes it extra-special.

* **Hitmontop** - Tyrogue is received at Mt. Mortar. I listed this particular evolution because I thought it'd be fitting for Gold to have the one introduced in Gen II.

* **Umbreon** - Bill gives an Eevee in Goldenrod. Umbreon is one of the Gen II evolutions. I didn't list Espeon since Red already has/had one. Also, it might be fitting to have an Umbreon go against his Espeon.

So what do you think his final team is? Are there Pokemon not in this list that he might have? Also, since Gold technically never got all three starters (unlike Red in Yellow version,) do you think he'd have all of them or just one?

A little something, something extra: The thing is, I was thinking the original Pokemon, something ocean borne would not necessarily look too much Dratini or Charmander, I just meant these two Pokemon are descendants of it, perhaps it was orange, deep sea dwelling and slowly moved closer to the shore. The ones that swam up-stream became a blue colour for camouflage in the shallower water and the few that went into the mountains, perhaps when the group hit a natural spring turned a darker orange colour for camouflage in and amongst the boulders and lava plumes( Why not a volcano; for the fire types?).

Most of the time when I think about pokeballs I imagine their diameter to be 3""-5""--much smaller than a Voltorb (around 1'7"" or 1'8"").  

How could people confuse Voltorbs, at such a large comparative size, with a pokeball?

Well... Perhaps a while ago, pokeballs were of a larger size.  In our world, the physical size of computers and many similar items have been shrinking with their development while their capacities and their abilities have increased significantly.  Perhaps pokeballs used to be significantly larger (needing more size for larger pokemon at that technology level), coming close to the size of Voltorbs.  According to Bulbapedia's page on [Pokeballs](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball), ancients trying to capture larger pokemon would commonly create larger pokeballs to make up for the differences in size and mass (from the episode Claydol Big and Tall).  

The main reason Voltorbs wouldn't be considered to have developed until more modern times?  Probably because of the color scheme developed for the main pokeballs hadn't come out yet.  Until the colors were truly standardized, the Voltorbs wouldn't really have much to go by, but once they saw something they could recognize, they developed a similar camouflage.  I know it's a game mechanic, but the ""item"" containers that you can see on the screen while scrolling look like giant pokeballs--perhaps the larger pokeballs are still used (or their likeness is used) for packaging of gifts or products.

Digimon and Pokémon both evolve in similar, yet different ways. What if the evolution process, in and of itself, evolved over time? 

The Digimon series largely seem to take place in roughly our timeframe, while Pokémon seems to take place well into the future, after some sort of great catastrophe (see: Lt. Surge theory)

In season 2 of Digimon, there is a ""tear"" in the sky when Arukenimon breaks down the barriers between the digital world and the physical world temporarily. In season 3 it's explained that the digital world is made up of data and people's dreams or some shit. Both these things demonstrate a clear link between the universes.

So what if the ""great catastrophe"" was actually the barrier between the digital world and physical world being completely torn down permanently, thus merging the two worlds? The evolution process changed, the digital creatures wiped out physical creatures that couldn't adapt to survive (we see evidence of physical creatures both in the Pokédex descriptions and the early games, like the fish tanks being filled with fish and not Magikarp) and people adapted previous digital technologies they had created to tame the rogue digital creatures, such as compression technology (Pokéballs) and data transferring (Bill's computer system).

Like for example, Farfetch'd, Psyduck, Ducklett, Swanna, and Golduck all look like ducks, but are all completely different pokemon. And Klink and Klang, they are metal gears, but somehow still alive. 
So, this leads me to the theory that maybe there was something bad that happened to the world (toxic waste, radioactive waste, explosion, ect.,) that all animals evolved but somehow in different ways, depending on where they where in the explosion. This could also explain why some pokemon are rarer than others, because their home/climate could have been close to whatever disaster happened. This might also explain why some pokemon are shiny, they could've gotten the worse of it, but are still alive. That does explain why shinies are rare.

It almost seems like each theme is expressing the Champion's state of mind. 

With [Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snSE1UKfp40) it's threatening and very erratic, almost manic. I think it shows how Blue is affected by his rival constantly taking everything away from him and this is his last chance to overcome him.

With [Lance and Red] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xULk_CK-hQ) you get this song that starts slow with strong instruments that quickly evolves into a fast, heart racing and powerful piece of music that shows their confidence and love of battle. They've been training forever, they're ready for anything that you can throw at them.

With [Steven Stone and Wallace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlzoG6l8TiY) I'm not so sure of since I don't have much experience with 3rd gen. The song starts off quick then tapers off, maybe showing how Steven, though he dislikes battling, is willing to fight because he has to, while with Wallace it shows off how he is a strong trainer even though he's a bit flamboyant? Maybe someone with more experience on the characters can offer some insight.

With [Cynthia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMsnxraYN4c) I think the entire song shows how strong she is. It starts fast and strong and stays that way through the fight. The constant drum line adds an essence of panic and frenzy that does her team wonders. She is not threatening in a malicious way, but rather the power she knows she wields gives her a certain awing presence in my opinion. She's willing to go all out against you to challenge herself as much as you.

Now we get to [Alder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJo7mYM2Lg). His song is slower than most, if not all of the others showing how he's willing to be patient in a match but at the same time it's almost celebratory in the way it's presented showing how he just wants to have an enjoyable match. Since in BW when you face him there are no threats to the populace, you're technically champion already and you're just going up against the League to challenge yourself, there's no reason for him to not see this as anything but a friendly bout.

Finally, there's [BW2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV8ZXxypHws). [Oh man, Iris. The entire song is just one long fun-fest. She's young enough to enjoy battling as a sport, but she cares enough about her Pokemon that she worries just a bit (hence the random slow parts). She's happy to have a powerful challenger and even mentions how much she looks forwards to these fights. At the point where you can challenge her the whole ordeal with team plasma is over and she doesn't have a care in the world.](/spoiler)

Creation vs. Evolution. Religion vs. Science. Did an omnipotent being create us and the world in a week, or did it take longer? Many scientific theories will lead you to believe that we were not created spontaneously, but evolved from a common ancestor. I like to believe that this is also prevalent in the Pokemon world. 

First we have Arceus, who symbolizes creation. 99% of us have heard the Sinnoh myths, stating that Arceus created all legendary pokemon who later shaped our world into what it is today. Dialogs created time, Palkia created space and Giratina created antimatter. With the necessities for a universe created, Arceus moved on. He then created Groudon, who created huge land masses, Rayquaza, who created the atmosphere, and Kyogre, who created the vast seas. After the pokemon had done their jobs, Arceus locked them away in different dimensions, towering pillars, dark caves, or deep abysses.

This leads me to the second part of my theory. The seas. Water represents life. From 10th grade biology, we should all know that all life starts in water. First, microscopic life started to form in the water, then slowly started getting more and more complex until a single pokemon emerged. It was pink and swam around the ocean for thousands of years, though it had no fins or gills. It used a giant bubble as a breathing apparatus. Natural selection occurred and many pokemon were created. Genetic variation caused different species to be born and pokemon evolved so they could adapt to their environment/predators. Later, the pink pokemon who would later be called Mew, strolled onto land and did it as it did in the water. Producing asexually (at first), Mew created the different types by traveling to different environments and adapting to its surroundings. Each different Typed mew then produced sexual offspring, creating different species of pokemon. This is supported by Mew's ability to transform, its ability to learn any TM, and the fact that it contains the DNA of every pokemon.

Additionally, in RSE there is a bird keeper named Hugh.

If you can call a comparison like this evidence. It can be pretty subjective, but in my opinion it's pretty obvious. Genesect has fake 'eyes' on the top of his head and real eyes below that. It's very similar to Kabuto. People have speculated since Genesect's debut that he is an altered Kabutops. His appearance is very similar to Kabutops and Scizor. Kabutops and Scizor look pretty similar as well and people have speculated that Kabutops evolved into Scizor over time. Shiny Kabutops is the same colour as Scizor. Scizor and Genesect are the same size. Genesect's Pokedex entry says it was an ancient Pokemon that was altered by Team Plasma. It has parellel's to Mewtwo, and Mewtwo was altered from another Pokemon. It also seems to be based on the Eva 01 unit from Neon Genesis Evangelion who was also an ancient creature that was altered into a purple armoured robot.

1. You can only use special poke balls  to catch the Pokemon in the safari zones.
2. In leaf green and fire red the day care on island four. The Pokemon you can see from over the fence are all catchable in the safari zone. (I know that the safari zone and the day care are on different islands but think about it the technology available in the Pokemon world eg. Fossil recreation and so on they can most likely have teleporting doors to the islands).
3. The safari zone Is the only place where Pokemon can run away from you. This is because they are already owned by someone else.
4. You can not attack Pokemon in the safari zone because otherwise there trainers would notice.
5. Pokemon cant attack you in the safari zone even though oak tells you Pokemon are dangerous this is because they don't have there trainers to guide them.

The pokemon are controlled by their trainers through cybernetic implants that get inserted and programed when a pokemon is put into a pokeball for the first time. This is why they'll go from attacking you to suddenly following your every command. This also explains why a pokemon won't listen to you right away after a trade. The programming form the previous trainer is still there and conflicts with yours. The badges, causing higher leveled traded pokemon to listen to you and allowing them to use certain moves out of battle are official devices made in cooperation with Silph Co. and The Pokemon League that can unlock new features in the pokemon's programming and are made to keep inexperienced trainers from getting themselves into trouble (blocking off surf to keep you from going somewhere that contains pokemon who can kill a trainer who isn't prepared).

This also explains how HMs and TMs work: They're discs and their contents are uploaded into your pokemon's cybernetic programming after use. The TMs, even though they break after one use, are easily removable while the HMs are more durable but harder to delete.

Final supporting statement: Pokemon can only learn 4 moves at a time. Each move takes up a data slot (computer memory usually comes in 1,2,4,8,16,32 etc. quantities). While the memory was never expanded, they later found a way to cache the data of a move after it was deleted and allows it to be restored.

Only the professors can take the hatchlings back to their region to be given to young trainers starting their journeys.

Why are wild Pokemon at different levels based on their location? It's all explainable:

Pokemon located near the starter town/lab are lower leveled because the lab was founded there for that purpose. Labs are established in breeding areas so as to study younger Pokemon, without risk from stronger Pokemon.

Areas like the Seafoam Islands, Mt. Mortar, Mt. Corona, Sevii Isles, Mt. Ember and other dungeons have stronger Pokemon simply because the environment is so harsh in these areas. Extreme examples are Mt. Silver, Cerulean Cave and the Spring Path.

The Pokemon in Victory Road (and any preceding routes) are so strong because the Elite Four make them that way, to protect themselves from mass attack and make sure only the strongest trainers can reach them.

Some gyms would have a reputation/history of being stronger than others. Since their Trainers on the surrounding routes would then also be stronger. The wild Pokemon in the area would logically be stronger, from fighting stronger trainers.

The Safari Zone's owners owners carefully cultivate their herds to be at a high enough level to make a Safari Game challenging, but not so high as to pose a risk to players. Raising Pokemon takes time and work from a Trainer, which is why Pokemon sold (Game Corner, etc.) aren't leveled up/fully evolved.

If we follow this train of thought and add in the fact that in all generations prior to generation 5 the poison/venom hurts the Pokemon when you move them and that gen 5 changes this we can assume that either:

 1) The Pokemon native to Unova can resist the poison/venom better than previous Pokemon

Or

2) The poison/venom of Unova is in some way different than that of  kanto,Johto,Hoenn, and Sinnoh.

In our world venom is classified into 2 separate categories known as neurotoxins, which affect the nevous system, and hemotoxins, which affect the cardiovascular system. My theory is that in Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh the poison/venom is comparable to that of hemotoxins which would affect them inside the stasis of the pokeball because the blood still has to pump to keep them alive and because the pain caused by it is often more extreme, while Unova has neurotoxin that would not affect them in the pokeball as much due to the slower and less direct nature of the harm it causes and because the pokemon may only operate on the basics needed for life within the pokeball. 

Thoughts?

Edit: when talking about the differing poisons I meant that hemotoxins take a more immediate affect then neurotoxins.

Edit 2:Most people within the thread seem to lean towards a change in the technology of the pokeball and as  read more of your ideas and theorems I can't help but see the viability of it so I feel that I needed to add it to the main post text (I actually feel kind of stupid for not thinking of that possibility). So here it is:

3) The technology of the pokeball has changed in some way that neutralizes the poison/venom, but I have a question. This seems like it would be a simple fix so why hadn't they done it in previous generations? perhaps the poison of unova was more deadly and thus pushed them to make this breakthrough sooner than other nations.

And /u/shifter25 your theory on this: 

Gen IV, they come up with an emergency measure to cure poison, but only just before fainting. This is incorporated as a function of Pokeballs, and the reason Pokemon have to be caught with a new ball in the Pal Park if brought over from Gen III is because prior to Gen IV, Pokeballs were not modifiable.
By Gen V, they come up with a new process that prevents damage from poison altogether outside of battle. (The reason it does not cure the poison is most likely due to political pressure; after all, poison is still a popular and valid battle strategy, and it would be cheap to allow trainers to simply switch in and out to cure it, like confusion.) The people who made the new balls in Gen IV anticipated new advancements and made them modifiable, so that instead of having to use new balls, the old balls simply undergo a treatment at the PokeTransfer facility.
The poison is just as potent, and the Pokemon just as weak to it; it's the Pokeballs that have changed.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1364584374.0,,,True,t3_1b74zu,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1b74zu/unova_poison_theory/,

The more bestial a legendary is in appearance the less sentient it is. Good examples of this are the legendary trio of Hoenn. In mythology they created/formed the world, but they seem to be, for lack of a better term, stupid. At least when compared to other legendary pokemon like mew and mewtwo. Groudon and kyogre are probably the best example for this because they are fueled by blind rage against each other. 

The closer they are to deity status the more apathetic or less sentient (Like the bestial appearance theory above) they act. An example for this is the creation trio from Sinnoh. With their godlike status they may not care about mortal problems or, as their mythos seems to imply, are very bestial in their mindset. In the games Mesprit, Uxie, and Azelf are used to control the trio and hold them back and one can conclude 1 of 2 things from this: 1) their powers are very hard for them to control and need the lake spirits to help them. Or 2) The lake spirits serve as both their mind or as a representation of both what humans need and what they lack ( In a way ) and as a buffer for their powers. 2 of the movies support this as well (the rise of darkrai and Giratina and the sky warrior).

In the case of many legendary pokemon they also seem to be very apathetic towards the problems the cause on poke-earth. A good example for this is Dialga and Palkia in the rise of Darkrai. They practically destroy the town and ( Temporarily ) ""kill"" Darkrai. When they finally stop them from battling ash and dawn have to freaking beg Palkia to return it to how it was (It can be argued that it was going to do this anyway and that the town was technically not being destroyed, but rather transported to another dimension. It can also be argued that Palkia didn't mean to do this and that it was an accident).

I realize there are exceptions like mew, Shaymin, Lugia, etc. but in general the legendary pokemon seem to follow these rules. 

EDIT: after thinking this through more I have some rules for the exceptions:

1) If psychic type or dark type, it's probably intelligent.

2) Size seems to matter in intelligence as well with smaller being high intelligence (Usually).

3) Many of the exceptions can still be very bestial in their nature, but generally less so.

Any thoughts on this?

The generally accepted idea is that it takes place in the past, thus the feudalism and warfare motif. However, what if it's actually the future? What if this is a future where you never existed? When I say you, I mean the protagonist in the main pokemon games. There are legendary pokemon available in Conquest that should have been caught by the the protagonists in the main games. Now, this could support it being the past, except for one thing: Mewtwo. Mewtwo can be found and linked with (caught), but he didn't exist until the events of red and blue, which means Conquest takes place after them. But why are all the legendaries free and roaming around? Because red, ethan, and the others never caught them, because they never existed. This is a world where Red and Ethan never stopped Team Rocket, and so either Team Rocket took over Kanto and Johto, or Mewtwo destroyed them. In Hoenn, the player never stopped team magma and team aqua, and so Kyogre and Groudon destroyed the region. In Sinnoh, nobody stopped team galactic. However, they caught Dialga and Palkia, but they couldn't catch Arceus. Eventually, there was a showdown between Team Galactic, using Palkia and Dialga, and Arceus. Arceus freed them from Galactic's control, but only after an intense battle. The forces unleashed in this duel of gods devastated the Sinnoh region beyond recovery. Meanwhile, in Unova, team Plasma, unopposed by Hilbert, put an end to the battling system in the only remaining thriving region (if we assume the games happen chronologically in order of release). When Ghetsis revealed his plot to N, N was able to defeat him using reshiram, and so the region's pokemon were set free. Because of this, the industries centered around pokemon collapsed, and pokeballs, potions, and most other items ceased to be produced. Meanwhile,  after the destruction of most of the regions, Arceus created the continent of the Ransei region (this is directly stated in the game). After creating it in his own image (The landmass itself is shaped like Arceus), he brought the human and pokemon survivors of the destroyed regions to Ransei. Many people from Unova who missed pokemon training travelled to Ransei as well. Various water and flying types, including those from Unova, found their way to Ransei while wandering around. The other Unova pokemon on Ransei were brought there by poachers, who stole them from Unova.

Fast forward a few hundred years. The technology poor people of Ransei long ago lost all contact with Unova, and it faded into legend, as Ransei regressed into a feudal system. The people and pokemon developed a new way of life and battling. Battling became even more central to life than in the other regions, pokemon battles between kingdoms deciding who ruled, and people who once would have been called ""trainers"" are now ""warriors."" This came about because many of the early settlers were there because they wanted to battle, so it was only natural that their culture was founded on it. Without pokeballs, however, warriors of ransei can only fight alongside pokemon they have truly emotionally bonded with. Pokemon ownership in Ransei is truly based on friendship and companionship. The legendaries in ransei came upon it and decided to stay, but remain in hiding. Arceus is the only plot central legendary, and he is found when you capture all the kingdoms of ransei to prove you are worthy. However, he cannot be bonded with permanently. This is because he has abandoned the weaker form he used during the events of d/p in favor of a more powerful one, and only intervenes when the way of life in Ransei is threatened.

tl;dr Pokemon Conquest takes place in a future where none of the protagonists in the main games existed, and as a result the other regions were destroyed.

I've always been wondering about the state of all the Gym Leaders. I mean, they have these large, similar buildings that have trainers come and either get crushed or the win a small sum of cash and a badge.

Now, come to think of it, a lot of useful buildings in the game are similar. In fact, you don't even need to read the signs, just look at the roofs.

This is all I am saying: the reason there appears to be no governing body in the game is because the government fully condones and supports the battling of pokemon.

For each gym badge, you notice shops sell more powerful items, you can use moves like cut outside of battle, and it gets you a little closer to the elite 4.

But why can't you use cut outside of battle anyway? It's not like you're going to get arrested just because you don't have the gym badge.. Or is it?

All Gym leaders have to do is sit around in their office (gym) and battle. Instead of paying their own prize money out of pocket, it's instead a small sum of government money. If you win, they give out a badge.

The badges are essentially a level on your Trainer's licence. All pokemon abilities outside of battle are regulated by the government. If you want to cut down smaller trees and shrubs, you're gonna need to prove you;re capable.

 
I think the government has had a crucial role in all of this. By keeping a majority of the population engaged in what is essentially a sport, they can keep the population engaged, and, for the most part, out of their hair.

I also made a mention about pokemarts. The reason you have to go up to the counter to buy things is because they sell stuff like potions and poke balls over the counter. They're extremely expensive, and when a full restore is essentially the equivalent of a pokemon tranquiliser and powerful antibiotic, yes, it can cause problems in the wrong hands. 

Pokeballs are the same way, when you can capture and practically enslave a being of space or time for your own personal devices under the right circumstances, again, yes, that can and will cause problems.

It's also the only reason you can't offload your fifty dire hit you picked up off the ground on some random stranger. You're not actually selling it to the pokemart guys, they're just giving you a stipend to destroy it for you.

Pokemon Centers I probably shouldn't have to explain- they're free clinics/emergency rooms for pokemon. all they do is heal smaller wounds, and any virus your pokemon picks up they won't help treat. Trainers even have a nickname for the lady in uniform who operates the machine: Nurse Joy.

I don't want to define the line where side characters like officer Jenny fit in, I'll leave that up to other people..

TL;DR:

Gyms are government regulated to make sure that people who are not licensed pokemon trainers (or really bad licensed ones) can abuse substances like potion or sell them on the black market;

Places like pokemarts are essentially stores that sell regular stuff, along with over the counter trainer supplies.

So I've come up with some Anime related theories, though some are more explanations than theories. 

1. First tackling Ash's age. People say that Ash is still 10. Some say that 1 year passed since his journey began, and others say that at one point, Ash mentioned that he has been travelling for 5 years. Many  sources, including various points in the anime, recognizes the league conferences as an annual event. That being said, Ash is able to complete 5 different leagues, which supports a five-year minimum theory, not counting the Orange League or Frontier or whatever else I missed. There was an episode where he celebrated his birthday. In the third movie Pokemon Short, he celebrates his one year anniversary with Pikachu (keep in mind this is still in the Johto region, prior to Olivine City, as he still has his Chikorita, not Bayleef). This makes him a minimum of 11, and, if going in order for one year per conference and one year per season, he would be approximately 15 to 16. Not only that, but for the Unova league, it is explained that there was a 3 month wait, which passed within several episodes. If ash were still 10, that 3 month wait would be quite significant in his journey...

2. Now I know there's a huge factor that debunks everything I said in #1. In Pokemon BW001, when Ash comes to Unova, the narrator states that Ash is 10 years old. This makes it without a doubt that he is 10 years old, which is, unfortunately, impossible, because he has already celebrated a 1 year anniversary. So, the conclusion here? I guess I can say nothing more than to just stop caring about Ash's age, as he's timeless, and the creators will not age him. Or, that there is some funky time-physics thing going on in the world of Pokemon. 

3. Next I'll explain Pokemon power and levels. First off, ditch everything you know about the games. This is an anime and there is no such thing as a numerical level. Pikachu is not numerically stronger than another Pokemon. It can get stronger by training, but so can every other Pokemon. Some Pokemon are genetically stronger than others. Some Pokemon train harder than others. So when Pikachu, who has been through 4 pokemon leagues prior to the Unova league, lost against a seemingly easy-to-beat Pokemon, it's because that Pokemon has been training for its entire life too. Unlike the games, Pokemon are not weak as shit for their entire lives as long as they live near Nuvema town or something. They will level up. Every area in the world will have levels exceeding 100, as well as level 1 Pokemon. So when Pikachu loses, it just means that it was not good enough. Saying that a level 100 Pikachu shouldn't lose to a level 5 Snivy simply doesn't apply here.

4. Pokemon League Conferences. People complain as to why the hell Ash doesn't hurry up and win every single conference, considering he was offered a Frontier brain position, and considering that he participated in 4 already. Ash is a skilled Pokemon trainer, but not the best. He is competing in a world full of skilled Pokemon trainers. You're not going to win first prize in a regional competition just because you compete in a lot of them. Especially since most likely, most of the other contenders have participated in just as many, if not more, competitions as you. 

5. A theory about the Pokemon League Conference: it's a non-professional conference. By winning a conference you have the ability to challenge the elite 4. If you win against one, you would probably take their place. That's how the Elite 4 and the Champion are ranked. They are the top 5 in the region. Let's think of each region as a country. So you have an untold number of regions, and an untold number of elite 4's, and an untold number of champions. Some kind of worldwide organization of Pokemon trainers made this happen: top 5 trainers of every region would deserve such a rank. So if you want to be considered a ""global competitor,"" then you would have to be in the elite 4. That's just a global competitor. Then you can complete globally. Think of it like the people who can become good enough to participate in global sports competitions. Then, when you're a champion, think of that like people who can participate in the olympics. The best of the best, but still, you can be the 100th best, and still be champion of that region, if there are 100 regions. Takes things into perspective, that in the end, Ash is just a very skilled trainer. Not an extremely powerful and unstoppable trainer, not a globally successful trainer, but a really good trainer. If Pokemon trainers were tennis players, he might be as good as the top player of a college tennis team or something. That kind of perspective. Can't even compare to a great professional, and can still lose to other ""top players,"" but he's getting there, and he's got time, because apparently, he's forever 10, even after turning 11. 


**TLDR, Ash is probably 15 to 17, Narrator confirms he is 10, impossible because he had a 1yr anniversary in Johto, levels don't exist in the anime, ash doesn't win pokemon leagues even though he participated in 4 because everyone else probably has too, and the pokemon league is actually an unprofessional league that fights to put you into the professional world of pokemon trainers.**",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1hezx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1hezx7/ash_ketchum_anime_theoriesexplanations/,

 This theory may be a stretch, but (based on the animé) every pokemon can learn to speak.

This is a long post (!!!). Here's a TL;DR: Cubones are probably not Kangaskhans. They are of cause Marowaks, and Marowaks are awesome, and you should include one in your next team. To all of those who have a little more time, here's the full version:

Introduction to conspiracies :
I trust that you all (deep deep down) know that 8 out of 10 theories in this subreddit, could never be approved of, or confirmed by, any instance at Game Freak. Neither do I believe them to be what the designers ever intented to express through their games. That doesn't make it any less fun to speculate.. This subreddit is mostly about what is fun, awesome and mysterious, and not so much about the actual likeliness of what you're proposing. This post is in no way ment to crush anybody's dreams, and in the end, you can believe what you want to believe. Being a believer in the theory of the cubone/kangaskhan-relation, you may not want to read on, though. Also, feel free to skip to section 2.

Many theorists support the theory of Cubone being the child of a deceased Kangaskhan (or one of the 5698 variations hereof). This post explores 1) the possible evidence for this NOT being the case, and 2) why Cubone - and especially Marowak - are still awesome and mysterious pokémon.

     Section 1): Why Cubone and Kangaskhan probably aren't related:

There are some suggestions that Cubone is in fact the child of a desieced Kangaskhan. If you don't already know about the official backgound for Cubone, check it out first at: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cubone_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29 (the pokédex-entries should suffice).

     1.1) Why they may or may not have been thought of as related prior to Gen I:

The most substantial evidence seems to be similarities between the looks of Cubone and of baby Kangaskhan. Judge for yourself, by looking at the original artwork (it doesn't get anymore original than this)... http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/9/94/104Cubone_RG.png + http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/5/5f/115Kangaskhan_RG.png ...convinced? I do see it, but It's really not that stunning, I think. And BTW, sprites aren't anymore original, they just make it more diffucult to determine anything because of technical constrains like low resolution. The colors (assuming the baby change to brown) and body-type I'll give you - please note, however, that it is possible that the beige things on top of the head were originally horns, even though they clearly became ears, once Kangaskhan made it to the animé. This leaves the unresolves question of how Cubone's skull can have two horns that aren't visible on it's presumed parent-pokémon. 

Kangaskhan's bluish forehead is featured both on mother and child, and probably wouldn't be present on the adult if it evolved from Marowak (this depends on which theory you have about the Marowak/Kangaskhan-relationship). The evidence that the glitch-pokémon M' (or M[]) evolves into Kangaskhan proves only one of two things:

(1) A Kangaskhan baby/pre-evolution was planned. This doesn't nesiccarily suggest any connection to Cubone. Most likely, though, is it that...

(2) when M' attempts to evolve, it simply evolves into the next slot on the game's list of pokémon indexs. It may, in fact, also evolve into Rhydon. Along with Rhydon, Kangaskhan is among the very first Pokémon in the game's internal indexing, which is likely why glitch-pokémon evolves into them.

Besides that, there were some obvious suggestions that the two wasn't just being put into seperate evolution-chains at the ""last minute"", as people sometimes claims, including: different types, no particular overlap in move-set, and the fact that this was included in the first Gen:

""Before the player reaches Lavender Town, members of Team Rocket [...] attempt to steal the skulls of Cubone [...]. One Cubone, however, was protected by its mother. The Cubone escaped, but its mother was killed. As a result, the Marowak's ghost remained in the Pokémon Tower. [...] the player unmasked her with the Silph Scope and subsequently battled her."" See http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Marowak_%28ghost%29 for more info.

This suggests that a MAROWAK gave birth to a Cubone, and died. Not a Kangaskhan.
Some evidense that DOES suggest that the two are related could be that they both share a native australian theme (boomerang- and kangaroo-inspired respectively).

     1.2) Why the theory certainly isn't treated like canon today:

Whether they were once thought of as related by the designers, we might never know for certain. Judge for yourself. There exists, however, strong suggestions that they aren't being treated like that today: 

Since breeding were introduced, Kangaskhan have breed Kangaskhan and Marowak/Cubone have breed Cubone. Since genders where introduces, Kangaskhan has been female only. The species still dosn't share types or any particular moves, neither do they share EV yield, abilities or any other stats like that.

Note however that the (Gen I) Stadium pokédex-entry for Kangaskhan stated that the ""[...] female raises its young in its belly pouch for around three years. The young is taken out once it learns to find food."" - strongly suggesting that the species origianlly may have be designed to include males as well.

The R/S/E pokédex-entry for Cubone (""Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds."") suggests that it's mother's face resembled the moon - the case for Marowak, not for Kangaskhan.

Besides this, Kangaskhan have later been portraied (through the animé etc.) to be a more social pokémon, while Cubones are described as solitary. (Again, the significanse of this depends on which theory you are a fan of).

An odd thing, however, is that Cubone, Marowak and Kangaskhan are listed in the Jhoto-dex as #209, #210 and #211 respectively. Again, judge for yourself. I personally believe that they were never intended to belong to the same evolution-chain, but that they are in fact related. Just like Pidgey/Pidove or Tauros/Bouffalant (at least that's how I see it).

     Section 2) Why Marowak is still awesome and mysterious.

First some pokédex-entries:

Crystal: ""Somewhere in the world is a cemetery just for Marowak. It gets its bones from those graves.""

HeartGold: ""It has been seen pounding boulders with the bone it carries in order to tap out messages to others.""

And some trivia:

""In the Pokémon Red and Blue beta, Marowak was originally known as ""Guardia"". This is the Spanish word for guardian."" (from Bulbapedia - haven't been able to confirm yet).

These enties suggest, that not only have Marowak grown into this highly intelligent and (unlike Cubone) social creature - they use tools/weapons as well. In real life, some animals like elephants have strong reactions to the death of a fellow animal. Elephants bury their deceased in piles of dirt and leaves, and mourn them for days, sometimes without moving from the spot. On few occations, elephants have been observed dragging the dead body of a fellow elephant (moved post-mortem) for miles to the place where it originally died. This suggests that elephants also somehow finds the place of death to be significan.

I think that Marowak was strongly inspired by this behaviour. Having a cemetery consisting only of Marowak bodies, suggests that these are creatures who pays great respect to their dead (inspired by the myth of the elephant graveyard). This could also explain their original name.. ""Guardian"" might very well mean guardian of the sacred cemetery.

Literally fighting with the bones of your ancestors, for the sole cause of protecting their last resting place... If that's not both poetic and awesome at the same time, I don't know what is.

Here's my theory on where they came from:

Back in the time when the only Pokemon that existed (as a species rather than individually) was Mew, most of the world was uninhabited.  As the Mew moved to different regions, they began to uniquely adapt to their environment and became attuned with the natural energy.  At this time, the world is only made of the most basic of elements: fire, water, and grass.  As time progressed, the elements interacted more, creating more advanced types, such as fire and water creating the air(in effect creating the Flying type - fire and water make steam and that's kind of air) element, water and grass creating sentient but not sapient creatures (Bug type).  As the elements became more complex, so did the forms that Mew evolved into.  Eventually, all 17 elements known today were created and the Mew as species were almost extinct while the Pokemon species had grown in size and variety as the former Mew adapted to their new environment and forms.

In conclusion: the starter Pokemon of each region were the first Pokemon that Mew changed into when they inhabited the given region.  The reason Grass, Fire, and Water are constant types is because those are the most basic of elements in the Pokemon world and is what energy the Mew absorbed to create their new forms.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_137x53,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/137x53/why_the_regional_starters_exist/,

Let's see what people think.

**7) Voltorb Explodes**
This is one that has bothered me for quite a while, ever since Gen II came out. It is all about Voltorb and Electrode, and what they are.

Now, I've heard the whole ""Haunter in a pokeball"" idea, but that seems based on fairly shaky evidence (even if it is a cool idea). My idea is based on two main points of evidence:

*A) Type.* First off is Voltorb's type. It is a pure Electric-type. Now, at first this didn't bother me too much, but when I went back and played pokemon again as an adult I started to think about it. Magnemite and Magneton both got upgraded from pure Electric-types to Electric/Steel types, but Voltorb and Electrode stayed pure Electric-types. Why? They are supposedly pokeballs that have somehow spontaneously come to life, which would seem to indicate being composed of metal. This brings me straight to my second point...

*B) Self Destruct.* This is another thing that always irked me. My own headcanon has always been that when a pokemon faints, it's nearly dead. If not for being returned to their pokeball, the pokemon would legitimately die soon after (which I found to be supported by the fact that your first pokemon returns to its pokeball in HeartGold and SoulSilver if it faints). So, building from that concept, how is it that Voltorb and Electrode, as a species, has survived at all? Sure, they popped up after the invention of pokeballs, but it still seems like they should have gone to extinction long before they spread, and that they should naturally stop spreading.

With both those in mind, I came to this conclusion: things which naturally possess the ability to self-destruct don't actually kill themselves when they use it (for reference, these pokemon are: the Geodude, Voltorb, Koffing, Pineco, Baltoy, and Ferroseed lines, as well as Genesect). 

But, that begs the question, why doesn't it destroy Voltorbs? And here is the major point of this theory: Voltorb isn't actually a living pokeball at all, but a living form of energy within a pokeball. Whatever the energy is, it is able to survive the explosion of its ""body"" and either rebuild itself, or ""infect"" another pokeball, allowing it to survive. This would explain why it can survive Self-Destructing, and also explain why it is a pure Electric-type. I know this one is a little shakier than some of my others, but I still think there's some possibility for it.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_vocar,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vocar/voltorb_theory/,

Well I have a theory on why that happened. ( I've used this theory multiple times and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't ) You see if you are repetitive with the same poke ball the Pokemon is obviously gonna know how to counteract that. Let give an example, ok your friend always punches you in the left shoulder at random times of the day. One day you just get tired of it so you decide I'm gonna catch the next punch he throws at me. So that day you greet your friend and he makes the movement like he's gonna punch you, you catch the punch and he tries again and you catch it. This happens for awhile so he decides to use his other fist and he hits successfully. In this story you represent the legendary and your friend represents the trainer trying to catch the legendary. The first few punches represent the first times the trainer throws a pokeball at the legendary in which the pokeballs usually don't capture but get a few rolls. After the multiple pokeballs the legendary now knows how to counteract ( you counteracting your friends punches ). So then your friend tries to do something different and use a different fist ( which represents a different pokeball ) that successfully hit him. Now my theory is that the Pokemon will actually PREDICT which pokeball you'll use next. ( Based on the few hundred pokeballs you used ) that's why when ever I'm trying to catch a legendary I don't constantly use ultra balls and hope for a catch. I throw a lot of pokeballs that are the same then throw one random pokeball. I don't promise this works one hundred percent of the time but it helps trying to catch that legendary that you want.
I'm not really asking for up votes all I ask for is for you to try this out. Also one other thing don't do a pattern of pokeballs. Do something completely random like 50 ultra, 5 random , 25 ultra then 10 random. Also make the Pokemon get used to one pokeball then use a different ball don't use all completely random pokeballs every turn.

3: Friendship evolution wasn’t discovered until generation 2. Why? Perhaps generation 1 is too soon after the war. It wasn’t until people made connections and friendships with Pokémon in times of war that they realized how important the bond between Pokémon and Trainer can be, which soon led to Friendship and Happiness evolution.

4: Each Pokémon Professor gives you an empty Pokedex, implying that they have no knowledge to share about the Pokémon in the area, except exactly how many there are. Maybe your character isn’t trying to learn about every Pokémon on a personal journey; perhaps he is recovering information that was lost in war.

5: For regions that are so close to one another, how is that the people of Kanto have no knowledge of the 100+ new Pokémon available just a short distance across the sea? Maybe this lack of knowledge is based upon the fact that some of these regions were at war with each other, and were unwilling to share information with each other.

6: Also regarding a lack of knowledge, why does each region have a different PC programmer who gets credit for doing essentially the same thing Bill did in 1996? Maybe no one in other regions knows what Bill did. This explains why Bill, Lanette, Brigette, Bebe, and Amanita have all been given credit for basically discovering the same thing. 

7: It was pointed out in the original Pokemon War Conspiracy that the war explains why towns all have Gyms and Pokecenters but no real forms of entertainment. Newer games have this. Perhaps this is just because newer games are more advanced and the towns can support more, or perhaps it is the result of the fact that it has now been a number of years since the Pokemon war, and now in this time of peace, people have time for entertainment again.

1360080044.0,60,self.pokemonconspiracies,17xqyu,There is a *definite* pattern in the way gyms and Elite Four members are chosen for regions (kinda long),78,18,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/17xqyu/there_is_a_definite_pattern_in_the_way_gyms_and/,"This is less of a conspiracy/theory and more of just a list of interesting observations.

NOTE: MINOR SPOILERS FOR B2/W2 TOWARDS THE END OF THIS POST

Observation 1: Between Johto and Kanto, there are 16 gyms. The 8 gyms in Kanto have different types than the 8 gyms in Johto (in other words, no types between the 16 gyms are repeated). Out of the 17 total types, this leaves only one not included in the first two regions, which is the Dark type. 

Observation 1a: There is still to this day, no gym leader of the Dark type.

Observation 1b: There have been, however, 3 Elite Four members specializing in the Dark type: Karen from Johto, Sydney from Hoenn, and Grimsley from Unova.

Observation 2: There is a clear but interrupted pattern between Johto and Kanto gyms in terms of their sequence of types. Going in order of each gym leader and Elite Four member and their respective types, from Brock to Lance:
Rock is weak to water

Water is weak to electric

Electric is resisted by grass

Grass is weak to poison

Poison is weak to psychic

*Here the pattern is interrupted, then starts over again*

Fire is weak to ground

*Moving to the Kanto 4*

Ground is weak to ice

Ice is weak to fighting

Fighting has no effect on ghost

*Another interruption*

*Here we transition from Kanto to Johto*

Flying is immune to ground (from the previous gym leader)

Bug is weak to flying

*Another interruption*

Normal is immune to ghost

Ghost is immune to fighting

Steel is weak to fighting

Ice is weak to steel

Dragon is weak to ice

*Interruption, and moving to the Johto 4*

Poison is weak to psychic

Fighting is resisted by poison

Dark is weak to fighting

And finally Lance, for the Johto champion, who breaks the pattern again.

There seems to be a pattern in the two Elite Fours, also. The Kanto 4 have a sort of incomplete circle going with type advantages. Lorelei can beat Lance but loses to Bruno. Bruno can beat Lorelei, but loses to Agatha. Lance only loses to Lorelei, and it's unclear who Agatha would lose to.

In the Johto Elite 4, we have three substitutions: Ice, Dragon and Ghost are replaced by Psychic, Poison and Dark. Now the type-relationships are between Fighting, Psychic, Poison, and Dark. Now we have Bruno beating Karen, but losing to Will. Karen beats Will, but loses to Bruno. Koga loses to Will, and beats Bruno, and Will beats Bruno AND Koga, while losing to Karen. In this respect, the Johto 4 is more evenly balanced than the Kanto 4.

No type-pattern applies to the Hoenn gyms, but there does seem to be a reference in the fact that the first gym leader is Rock type, and the second gym has a type advantage, being Fighting type. After this, the pattern doesn't apply.

The Hoenn Elite Four have a similar pattern to the Kanto 4, since 3/4 types are the same, and the only change being Sydney's Dark types who replace Bruno's Fighting types. This new type addition, as well as Steven Stone's dual-Rock-and-Steel specialty creates a sort of type-advantage pentagon between all of the Hoenn 4 and their champion. 

This pattern is gone once Wallace replaces Steven in Emerald.

The Sinnoh gyms pull a similar stunt as the Hoenn gyms, making the first gym Rock type and the second gym advantageous against the first gym (in Kanto, the second gym was water and in Hoenn, it was fighting. For Sinnoh, it's grass).

Once again, the Sinnoh 4 have a clear but incomplete type-relationship. Bug beats Psychic, but loses to Fire. Fire beats Bug, but loses to Ground. Ground beats Fire, but doesn't lose to anybody. And Psychic loses to Bug, but doesn't really beat anybody. However, this incomplete pattern can be rectified by noticing that the Sinnoh 4 purposefully include Pokemon that are not of their specialty type, or at least have dual types, such as Aaron's Drapion, Flint's Steelix/Drifblim/Lopunny, and Lucian's Bronzong. Cynthia, having no type-specialty, doesn't fit.

Finally, for Unova (B/W), the pattern doesn't apply to the first three gyms, then starts after Elesa.
Electric loses to ground, 
Ground loses to flying, 
Flying loses to ice, 
Dragon loses to ice.

In B2W2, the pattern is fixed in one spot, and broken in another, due to the addition of Roxie (whose poison beats Burgh's bug) and the removal of Bryce and being replaced by Marlon, whose water doesn't have any relationship to Drayden's dragon. 

The Unova 4 have the most clear relationship between themselves, and is very similar to the Johto 4, since only one type is different (Poison became Ghost). Dark, Ghost, Psychic, and Fighting have multiple interactions which are roughly even, sometimes even sharing immunities. Alder, the champion in BW, doesn't have a clear specialty, but seems to lean towards Bug, since half of his team has that type. This mixes him in well with the Unova 4. The same cannot be said for Iris in B2W2.

Other interesting observations:

The penultimate gym leader has been of the Ice-type 3 times (Johto, Sinnoh, Unova BW). 

A dragon-type trainer has been the final gym leader twice, an Elite Four member twice, and a champion twice. Thanks to a comment from PkMn_Trainer_AJ correcting my initial statement that Hoenn lacks a dragon-type trainer, we can also observe that there has been a dragon-type specialist in every region/generation.

Johto introduced two new types: Dark and Steel. The Johto region had one Dark type E4 member and one Steel type gym leader. Since their introductions, either Dark or Steel has been represented in each generation.

But let's say that the reason no one physically attacks each other is because the pokemon universe takes place shortly after some nuclear apocalypse brought on by war, so the powers that be decided that no one were to harm another and those poweres first made their rise to power from the origin of catastrophe in Kanto. However, being caught up by such diplomacy to maintain peace as well as to not bother or harm endangered ecosystems, no one even bothered studying pokemon everywhere. Of course, the pokemon came from mutations caused by radiation of preexisting lifeforms, hence why pokemon oft resemble creatures of our own world. Like we just discovered a monkey in Africa, and all I think is ""wtf? I thought our animals were going extinct except for shit we find in Antarctic ocean, but a monkey? In what is considered the center of human origin?"" Sounds kinda odd. It's as if in an attempt to keep older areas of the earth untouched by modern man, we inadvertently keep ourselves from discovering animals that have been there for a millenia or two.

Then, in our own dumbfounded ""Well someone's got to have seen it"" mentality, it took until people like Prof. Oak and Elm and etc. sat there and went, ""Hang on a minute, maybe we should exchange pokemon notes,"" before all these other Pokemon were added to a database. Like if a new wildlife biologist of Arizona and a wildlife biologist of Maine were talking on the phone and Prof. Arizona was like ""well, Snakes like to......."" and Maine was just like ""Wait, wtf is a snake?""

1343550339.0,58,self.pokemonconspiracies,xc3m7,Politics of Pokémon: regulation battles are proxies for duels to the death; Champion = Ruler,72,14,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/xc3m7/politics_of_pokémon_regulation_battles_are/,"Politics, simply put, is *violence*. In prehistoric times, warring chieftains reigned supreme, resolving their conflicts by brute force.

Eventually, however, we began to realize: *We don't have to kill each other every time we disagree!* All we have to do is figure out who *would* win if we *did* try to kill each other. This way, everyone's happy: The loser gets to live, and the winner gets a nice productive slave.

The history of civilization is the history of such duel-proxies. In modern times, we've settled on the institution of *democracy*. We count the heads on both sides, assume that the larger horde would likely prevail in a war against the smaller, figure it would be a terrible bother anyway, and then head on home.

Anyway, enough lecturing. What does this have to do with Pokémon?

A democracy would never work in the Pokémon world, for a simple reason: Victory in battle has much more to do with the strength of one's Pokémon than with the numbers on each side. A well-charged Pikachu can easily take on a horde of angry villagers. Pokémon are far greater agents of creation and destruction (though mostly the latter) than any artifacts of human design.

Thus, we understand how the institution of the *Pokémon League* came about in the world of Pokémon: it is an organization in which precedence is determined by one's ability to kill other trainers. This ability is measured by success in Pokémon battles, which have developed a precise set of standard rules that are carefully designed so that even though nobody is hurt, the outcome is a highly accurate determination of who would win a hypothetical fight to the death.

So, Pokémon battling is much more than just an entertaining sport. It is literally a matter of life and death. All political power is won in the Pokémon arena. Thus, Gym Leaders in effect are local warlords; the Elite Four is the high council of nobles, and the Pokémon Champion is the Supreme Overlord.

To be sure, the Champion would be unwise to act without the support of his vassals, since all together they could easily overpower him.

Gold is fairly rare, especially in nugget form, but how big would a nugget actually be?

I'm about to get extremely speculative, so be forewarned.

if we assume that a pokedollar is equal to about 3 yen, and that a yen is equal to about 1 cent in US currency, then pokedollars are roughly equivalent to 3 cents, meaning a nugget sells for about $150 (5000/100 = 50 x 3 = 150), which, according to today's gold prices, would mean a nugget is roughly 3 grams in size. 

Now, a gram of gold is not very big, roughly the size of a stamp and about as thick, so I would not call 3 grams of gold a ""nugget."" Still, finding three grams of gold would be a pretty nice find, so maybe...

But, assuming my previous calculations are correct, we could also assume that the price of gold is much lower in the pokemon world (which would make sense if you can find it laying around). If we assume a nugget is about an ounce of gold, that's almost a thousand dollars in today's currency which would be worth over 30,000 pokedollars. 

...

Okay, I'm tired and my train of thought is already losing steam. I have no real answer to my question, so it's more of an interesting thing to note.

The specimen type, codenamed ""Ditto,"" has shown an affinity to manipulation. The development of an advanced computer program has allowed us the ability to create artificial DNA. At first we used it to replicate the Mew DNA in order to keep our supplies up. However, out of curiosity we used it to develop a completely unique DNA strand that produced a chimera.

This chimera was based on an ape, but we added unique features to it. The result was a three foot tall, muscular creature. The simulation of the chimera showed promise, but unfortunately, even with the DNA synthesized we weren't able to create a ""live"" version of it. However, we didn't stop and eventually on a hunch we exposed a Ditto to the DNA. 

The results were amazing. Initially the Ditto had trouble with the artificial DNA, but after injecting it with a dose of M01 and exposing the creature to radiation and an electric shock, the Ditto mimicked the DNA. After about six hours, the Ditto became the chimera.

The chimera was an exact match to the simulation. It stood three feet tall. Like other subjects that had been exposed to radiation and an external element, the chimera took on the ability to control electricity. After several tests, the chimera was codenamed ""Electabuzz."" The trend of naming these creatures came down from the original team and despite our voicing of complaints, this trend has remained the norm. 

I digress. The fact that we were able to create a new creature using artificial chimera DNA and a Ditto shows promise. We have already begun developing new chimeras and reproducing the original chimera with other Dittos. We'll have to see where this goes after further experiments.

My [map](http://i.imgur.com/UGtxz8Q.jpg) of Kalos (I recommend you look at it first, since I reference it a lot here).

Facts:

The region is based on France, and is shaped like a crudely drawn star.

Lumiose City's tower is the region's iconic structure.

The region is divided into [Central, Coastal and Mountain Kalos](http://i.imgur.com/k5PlCt4.jpg). 

Speculation:


You start at the Versailles-like mansion in the southern part of (Central) Kalos in both versions.

The Daycare center is at point #27.

X takes you through Central, Mountain and Coastal Kalos in that order.

Y takes you through Central, Coastal and Mountain Kalos in that order.

Xerneas is found in the northwestern part of (Coastal) Kalos, in the Carnac stones-like monument.

Yveltal is found at the top of the mountain in the northeastern part of (Mountain) Kalos.

The Pokémon League is at the castle-like building at point #21 in my map.
I believe there will be 2 other counterpart legendaries to Xerneas and Yveltal, representing the Z and W chromosomes found in certain species of Birds, Reptiles and Arthropods. The Z legendary will probably be a serpent or wyvern inspired by the creature who gnawed on the roots of Yggdrasil, while the W legendary could potentially represent various different creature living in Yggdrasil; i.e. the ogresses, the messenger squirrel or even the god Odin, since Yggdrasil literally means ""Odin's horse"".

1359134030.0,53,self.pokemonconspiracies,179hyv,Pokemon: capitalism and the fall of the modern world (x-post from /r/fantheories),66,13,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/179hyv/pokemon_capitalism_and_the_fall_of_the_modern/,"*I'm going to start out by saying this isn't my work. I found this on /r/fantheories and I didn't see it get posted here so I figured I would. All credit goes to /u/HoverboardViking.*

The Pokemon universe is not strange. We live in it. We share the same type of ideology. Our governments and economies are the same. The only real difference is, we don't catch pocket monsters in magic balls.

Why? Take a look at Ash. Ash like every other young person in the Pokemon universe wants to become a Pokemon master. He was raised believing it was what he should want. What child in that world wants to grow up and be a firefighter or work on a farm? Like his father, Ash believed he was destined just like everyone else to 'catch 'em all'.

'Catch 'em all' is the perfect phrase, because that is what Silph Co wants. Silph Co wants people out there catching Pokemon, spending money on potions and balls to catch caterpillars and rats, storing them in Pokemon centers, healing them, traveling from place to place. No one is concerned with growing food, raising animals, learning anything or having any type of real advancement if it is not connected to Pokemon.

The Pokemon world is controlled by Unbridled Capitalism in the worst form: pure monopoly. Ash and every young person plays their role. They bought the dream. 'I wana be the very best, like no one ever was—I will travel across the lands, searching far and wide—gota catch em—I know it's my destiny—In a world we must defend.' Defend against what? Why do you have to catch them all? Why do you have the to be the best? Because you are the best consumer that way.

Think about the games, you plow through them catching everything in sight, every trainer you meet in the open world is easily the dumbest, most generic, unoriginal person you could ever conceive; without any actual talent or ability, throwing three Arcanines at you. You beat them all, catch everything, destroy the gyms and at the end, there are the elites with the best Pokemon. What do you do? You buy potions and pp ups and etcs from Silph Co. All the money you earned from battles gets slowly pushed back into Silph.

In truth, you don't even need to catch Pokemon, you can buy them from the 'game corners'. Buy 6 Dratinis, lvl them like mad, get 6 Dragonites, storm the world to bits. If you have the money, why not do it? Well, it goes against the idea. The elites of the Pokemon world don't want you to succeed. They want you catching trash Pokemon, lvlin them, spending money. Problem is, most people in the Pokemon universe fail, they never become masters or even 'average'. They continue to try, they never give up, they never change. It is ingrained into the very ideology of that world. It reminds me of something else.

Much like our own world, we are sold a dream, told we need to get good grades to go to a good school, to get a good job, to have a good family and nice house. Really, all you need is money. Truly, all you are expected to do is take on debt and keep pushing what money you might skimp and save right back into the hands of the rich and powerful. We don't catch Pokemon, but we catch new cars and possessions left and right.

The Pokemon world is one of government controlled monopolies; or business controlled governments. Is there even a government? It's a world for profit and everything else is of no value.

No value to the teeth. Look at all those poor Pokemon: mythical, innocent, mysterious, interesting. They have existed for as long as people have and more or less the two lived together. In the modern world they are slaves, commodities to be bottled up and turned into moving trophies all for money. Some will even go so far as to catch their ancient gods and order them to fight Weedles. What really is happening is the destruction of the old world, of the myth and purity and spirit that made the world what it once was.

The known universe of pokemon seems to parallel Japan: mountainous volcanic islands, a once deep seeded faith and spirituality to nature and the forest. Is there any reason to believe there isn't a whole planet full of other countries outside of what we have seen in Pokemon so far?

Is there a USA like land where millions of people live in big houses and each one has a Charizard to compare to another person's Charizard?

Is there a France, where people walk around with Mr. Mimes on leashes sneering at everyone else?

Is there a Germany, where people have weird basement sex parties with Golems?

Is there a China like country, where factories are filled with Pokemon, commanded to build goods to be sold?

Regardless, the world of Pokemon is our own, one ready to fall apart, ready to cave in where it was built on greed, lies, and the destruction of the natural world. It's a world where your evil organization, Team Rocket, isn't really that much worse than yourself. It's a world of capitalism and selfishness.

Now, this is less a conspiracy theory (or as conspiracy-like that pokémon can get) and more of a logical deduction based on past behavior from Game Freak as well as what we know about the console that the next games will be on, but it does get pretty conspiracy at the end. So, without further ado, lets jump in.

The first time Game Freak made remakes of previous generations was when they released FireRed and LeafGreen, remakes of the classic games. They did this because when the franchise moved to the GameBoy Advanced, they lost the ability for the games to communicate with past iterations. This means that those remakes were absolutely required to obtain pokémon that were only available in the previous games. The same is true of the Gen II remakes, seeing as many Johto pokemon were still unable to be legitimately obtained.

Now, given what I know of the hardware that gen VI will be coming out on, I hypothesize that we're about to run into the same disconnect that happened between gens II &amp; III. The 3DS has only one game card slot, so a hard connection will be impossible, and I doubt that 3DS games can communicate with DS games in the same way that the gen V games could. This means that, once again, there will be no way to obtain pokemon from previous generations and remakes will be required.

And, of course, the colors for X &amp; Y are blue and red respectively, which are the same as ruby and sapphire, so they're totally leading us on with that!

Some say that Arceus is god and the first Pokémon. It is also generally accepted that there was a war which is why there are so few people, a lack of a father for the protagonist of the main characters (except Ruby/Sapphire) and the reason why people are constantly discovering new Pokémon.

I have a different viewpoint. 

First, not all Pokémon were man-made, but some are (like Castform and Porygon). Pokémon are natural creatures that were brought about through evolution. This is why many of them resemble our animals and why they can evolve to adapt a more suitable form.

Arceus did not create all Pokémon. This is just superstition and legend. Pokémon arose naturally. Similarly, not all Pokémon are descended from Mew. If they were, no Mew would exist today.

Finally, the war. There was clearly a war at some point and Pokémon were involved. Lt. Surge references it when you face him. However, I don't think this is why the population is so low, or why Red doesn't have a father. 

Here is what happened. At some point in the future, humans travel to a new planet that contains Pokémon. These Pokémon have always been there and evolved naturally. Some of them are really powerful, some of them are not. When the humans arrived there was a small war to see who got to control what. That is when Lt. Surge fought, and when we discovered we could bond with the Pokémon much better than with our own Earth animals. Each Region is a collection of colonies, essentially a city-state. That is why new Pokémon are constantly being discovered, because new colonies are being formed in other areas. Most of the buildings are pre-fab, which is why so many look the same (Pokecenters, Pokemarts, even people's homes). Our relative newness to the world has caused changes, especially when we create new Pokémon. This also explains why eggs are such a new discovery, because we haven't been around that long to notice them before. 

Now, the legends part throws me off. You'd figure that a bunch of people chosen to start a new colony on an alien planet would be smart enough not to be superstitious. I mean, someone invented the Pokeball. But whatever, people are stupid.

It’s a bit lengthy, so bear with me.

I was looking through some posts about legendary Pokemon in r/pokemon earlier, and I read through some of the theories about them in this sub too. There are various theories about them, ranging from the idea that they’re just very rare or endangered to the possibility that they’re gods or demigods, but I feel like we’ve overlooked another possibility: they reproduce asexually. [Parthenogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis) is a mechanism by which [invertebrates and some vertebrates]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Natural_occurrence) can reproduce asexually, so why not legendary Pokemon? They seem to be solitary creatures (I don’t think anyone’s ever seen a flock of Zapdos or a pack of Suicune), and this mode of reproduction doesn’t require any contact between members of a species; in fact, it could allow for only one or two members of that species to exist simultaneously (a parent and child, for instance). Some animals can reproduce both sexually and asexually [(like aphids)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid#Reproduction), but there are those that have lost the ability to reproduce sexually and have become locked into the asexual model [(like Bdelloid rotifers)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdelloidea). Couldn’t this be the case with legendary Pokemon?

Asexual reproduction can produce diploid (two sets of chromosomes) females [(thelytoky)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelytoky) or haploid (one set of chromosomes) males [(arrhenotoky)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenotoky), or both (deuterotoky – don’t have a wiki link for that one; [ctrl f on this page]( http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in673) for a brief definition). It varies by species whether or not these males are fertile. Additionally, [depending on the type of parthenogenesis, female offspring may or may or may not be full clones of their mother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Types_and_mechanisms). 

So let’s say that evolution (in terms of gradual population change, not Pikachu + thunderstone = Raichu) favored asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction for these species of Pokemon. The idea being that, for whatever reason, sterility in the haploid males was heavily selected for (perhaps sterile male drones were a greater aid to the survival of the species than fertile males). Eventually, the ability of (what we now refer to as) legendary Pokemon to reproduce sexually was lost entirely (with exception, namely Manaphy). This is why putting a legendary Pokemon in the Daycare Center with a Ditto fails to produce any eggs. Ditto can transform into said legendary Pokemon, but in doing so, it perfectly mimics that Pokemon’s anatomy, so that neither it nor the original have the means to breed with one another. 

Cresselia provides a good example of this mode of reproduction. Cresselia’s gender ratio is 100% female. This fits perfectly with the model of asexual reproduction I’ve described above. In parthenogenesis, with rare exceptions, it is always the females that produce offspring, so a 100% female gender ratio poses no problems at all, and actually serves to strengthen support for the asexual reproduction of legendary Pokemon.

This brings me to the issue of gender. As far as I know, all legendary Pokemon are listed as genderless (except Cresselia, but I’ve gone over that). There are a few possible explanations for this. One, it may simply be that the study of Pokemon genetics and reproduction are not yet very well developed, after all it was only thirteen years ago (going off of the Japanese release date of Gold and Silver) that Pokemon researchers/scientists figured out that leaving a male and a female Pokemon alone together resulted in little babies. As subsequent games were released, more and more was shown to be understood about Pokemon genetics and reproduction: breeding rates; egg groups and egg moves; inheriting stats, natures, and abilities; and breeding for shininess. Research into Pokemon genetics and reproduction may simply not yet have advanced far enough to explain much beyond the straightforward “male + female = baby” model of reproduction. Currently unable to understand reproduction via parthenogenesis, they fall back on saying that legendary Pokemon are genderless. A second possibility is that these legendary Pokemon are hermaphroditic. [Sequential hermaphrodites]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism) can change from [male to female]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism#Protandry) or [female to male]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism#Protogyny), while [simultaneous hermaphrodites]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite#Simultaneous_hermaphrodites) contain both male and female sex organs. Again, since the study of Pokemon genetics and reproduction seems to be a young science at this point in time, it could simply be that Pokemon researchers have yet to understand concepts beyond “always male” and “always female”, leading to their conclusion that legendary Pokemon have no gender.

Admittedly, there are some holes in this theory. For one, why can’t a Ditto that has transformed into a legendary Pokemon subsequently reproduce asexually like the original can? Additionally, my second explanation of the potential gender status of legendaries conflicts with my theory of their reproduction via parthenogenesis, since hermaphroditic organisms tend to mate, rarely reproducing through self-fertilization (and parthenogenesis happens in the absence of fertilization). There is another issue with my theory in that it doesn’t effectively explain Pokemon like Arceus, Dialga, or Palkia (just examples, I know there are others). These types of legendary Pokemon seem to be more than just extremely rare Pokemon with quirky modes of reproduction, as they have powers enabling them to literally alter the fabric of reality. They and others seem to fit better with the god/demigod model of legendary Pokemon.

Or maybe I’ve spent far too much time sitting here analyzing a game marketed at ten-year-olds. ^^^^Just ^^^^kidding, ^^^^I’ll ^^^^love ^^^^Pokemon ^^^^forever.

One who resides in the elite four, and one who chills out doing adventures. This is best seen in Gen 2, or Heart Gold and Soul Silver. After you beat Lance, you're not really recognized as champion. In Gen 3 and 4 you're recognized as champion, right after you beat the league. In Gen 3 when you go to the fan club they recognize you, and in Gen 4, when you go to the boat in snowpoint. But back to the topic of Gen 2. Now, after you beat Red, you get a ribbon that sort of makes it official. Now the one hole I could think of is in gen 1. Before you go through the elite four you are never notified that there will be a champion. Furthermore, Lance's room is tricked out, much like a champion's room. So I think that Lance was meant to be the final challenge, but Blue beat him.

Arceus is hatched from an egg and he creates Palkia, Dialga, and Giratina. Then he creates the Pokeverse. However, his first try in creating a Pokeverse everything goes bad. Too many Pokemon species are going extinct and humans are becoming weak and vulnerable. So Arceus decides that this is not the universe he wished to create and no longer wants to see it suffer. So he ""destroys it into thin air"" as is one of his powers. Then he creates a new Pokeverse, relatively similar to his last except for a few things. One of those things being Mew.

-Both have veins visible around their bodies

-Their ""masks"" are very similar

-MegaLucario has a Y-shaped chest and Yveltal's entire body is Y-shaped

-Also, how MegaLucario's limbs and dreadlocks are tipped with red is similar to how Yveltal's limbs are red at the ends


Could Yveltal's DNA possibly be used to create some of the mega formes, such as Lucario's mega forme, with Xerneas' DNA used to create others?

Why?

1.The biggest reason is the glowing, rainbow double helix in the Japanese logos, and that the bracelets on the player characters also have a DNA helix in a rainbowy orb on them, it seems very important.

2.Both Mewtwo and Deoxys are getting a lot of promotion recently, and both of these Pokemon relate to DNA.

As for Xerneas and Yveltal:

1.Most people think that these Pokemon look very ""natural"" and ""organic,"" but they look pretty artificial to me.

2. Xerneas has a highly reflective, sleek, metallic-black coat, judging by the way it's shaded, and the ""spots"" on its flank look more like the reflection of the glow on its antler. Speaking of its antler, they are designed to look like the structure double helix, a bit too perfectly to be natural. Also, the X in its eyes just look cyborg-y to me and the white glowing parts on its legs, chest and face look like tron lines. I think it will be Psychic/Electric, and if faerie type is real, Faerie/Electric, because DNA is an electrical charged molecule.

3. Yveltal has exposed veins or a nervous system on its body, which are what the black streaks on its body are. The black on its back don't really look like feathers, but rather a black, rubbery skin. Its claws also look strange, like a mad scientist added them. Dark/Flying type, so it and Xern will be perfectly balanced

4. I also want to say that Yveltal is fully organic, but not natural (like Mewtwo) and Xerneas is mostly organic, but with some very well-hidden mechanical parts, and is artificial as well.

5. Last but not least, I think that gen 6 will have two rival companies that are the evil teams, and create the legendaries to be better than the other team/company. Also, I am tired of the ""ancient entity has been awaken"" plot.

When we send the Pokemon to sleep, we leave them in Fennels lab so she can run her experiments, and she *engineers* the pokemon met inside your own pokemon's dream. Her lab seems simple, but perhaps its a small cover for her own cloning lab, and she uses the dreams as a medium. She rewards you with one clone, with altered genetics due to the process, resulting in DW abilities. The level of 10 a side effect of cloning. The Legendaries (such as the Arceus recieved during the DW event) are so powerful because that pokemon truly visited the dream, and left her enough data for a perfected clone. Also, the others recieved through events were merely your pokemons greatest dreams, which left enough data for Fennel to make the clone as close as possible to it.

I realize this may be full of holes and incosistencies, but I felt the need to make another attempt at conspiracies after my Vannilite theory failed. Criticism is greatly appreciated and rewarded.

*Edit- The one hour rule on the time spent in Dream World is due to the fact Musharna's mist is the fuel to clear the pokemons mind and obtain clear results. The mist only allows for an hour of peaceful sleep at most, so as soon as your hour is up, the dream is too foggy to be analyzed.

The following is the in game explanation for the PC Storage System on my Pokémon roleplaying forum.  This explanation mentions a couple of original NPCs and locations, but the concept can be universal for the Pokémon franchise.  Enjoy. :D

""Originally developed by Jordan Lanea, the Pokémon Personal Computer Storage System (Often abbreviated as simply PC) is a massive network that, in the most basic sense, stores Poké Balls on an offsite location.

The process in which Poké Balls are stored is an interesting one. First and foremost, every Poké Ball is encrypted with a Trainer's ID number. Upon registering for a Trainer Card, a PC ""storage box"" is created. In all actuality, a space on the MASSIVE grounds of ""Lanea Ranch"" is opened up for that Trainer. A Trainer can only have a maximum of six Pokémon on them at a given time which is logged whenever a Pokémon is captured and when Pokémon are transferred from party to storage. All excess Pokémon are transported via an improved form of replicated Apricorn energy conversion via the PokéWatch and Pokémon Center PC teleporters. These Poké Balls then arrive at the Trainer's storage box on Lanea Ranch and are logged in their account.

The method of transferring Pokémon back to their Trainers is slightly different. At every Pokémon Center and other choice locations, Trainers are able to access their accounts via PCs. To log in, Trainers insert their Trainer Card and input a personal password. Once logged in, the Trainer can view their stored Pokémon and swap them out using the PC's built in teleporter, use a public video phone, log their personal journal, and view their earned ""Achievements"".""

So, if this hypothesis holds, the two antagonists of the first Pokémon games are Shigeru Miyamoto and his creation, Mario.

Edit: As /u/bgipson16 points out below, this post's title may be misleading. I don't mean that Giovanni is literally Mario, but that he can be viewed as a representative parallel of Mario in the Pokémon universe.

Satoshi is only able to achieve his goal of challenging Shigeru once he has overcome a representation of Shigeru's greatest achievement, Mario.

This interpretation is supported by the real world evidence:

&gt;Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Pikmin, and Donkey Kong, was assigned to help in the development of the initial versions of Pocket Monsters, Red and Green. During this time Tajiri came to admire Miyamoto as a mentor. As a tribute to Miyamoto and Tajiri, the main character of the games and his rival have ""Satoshi"" and ""Shigeru"" among their default names, while the main character of the anime, Ash Ketchum, and his first rival, Gary Oak, are named the same, respectively.

You see, basically anyone with a pokeball can catch a pokemon, and in our games we are usually 10 years old. So that means we can assume that there's a minimum age of 10 for a starter pokemon trainer, after which we can assume trainers go on journeys around the regions. So If a 10 year old caught a pidgey, he could go flying around anywhere he wanted. This would open up infinite possibilities for everyone. In the 10 year old's case, the only danger would be his own safety. But say, a 30 year old trainer catches a flying pokemon. He could go do anything illegal he wanted, ie stealing, etc. with little fear of getting caught, as he can just jump on his pokemon and fly out of there.

So the Government(?) of the Pokemon regions came up with the concept of HM and Gym Badges.

Obtaining a gym badge shows that you are a capable trainer, and as more gym badges are amassed, you are allowed more freedom on your HM moves out of battle (cut&gt;flash&gt;Fly&gt;surf&gt;Strength, etc). Basically, you are being certified by the gyms as being capable enough to travel in these ways and your gym and travel experiences show that you will be able to bear the burden of these added powers of your Pokemon and not commit any crimes, ie be of strong moral character (though not all, of course)

**TLDR:** HM are only usable after gyms because Gyms certify you as a capable trainer who can handle the perks of the pokemon (flying, surfing) and those who dont have gym badges cannot enjoy these because they arent certified and are potentially a harm to themselves, and others.

Before we begin, I apologize for the ridiculous size of this theory.

Porygon is an interesting Pokemon, in that it is man-made, and in essence, a computer program.

But if this were true, if Porygon was created by man, why is it so rare?  And why haven't they created any other programmable Pokemon?

In short, Porygon was an accident.  The scientists at Sylph *were* trying to create a computer Pokemon, to be sure.  But they could never quite get it right.  One night, they decided to go home while the code compiled (which would take quite a while, considering they were basically trying to create life).  When they came back in the morning, they found success!  Not only had a computerized Pokemon been created, but it was sitting in the real world!

What really happened was this:  A Ditto, in its travels to find a new idea, came across the computer.  It saw the idea and design for a computerized Pokemon, and became one.

Sylph tried to reproduce Porygon, but to no avail, though they discovered they could breed it like most other Pokemon.  Since Sylph was Rocket-controlled at the time, rather than admitting the rather accidental nature of Porygon, they unveiled their 'creation' and included a falsified story of a Sylph code in Porygon's programming that prevents copying.

So how does this Pokemon evolve? [As previously explained] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/166dgo/ditto_theory_part_iv_trading_and_the_everstone/), the trading process can sometimes excite the transformative nature of the inner Ditto, causing an evolution.  After seeing that, for instance, an Onix and a Metal Coat will combine to form a Steelix, Sylph programmers had an idea.  They had been trying, again unsuccessfully, to create a code to induce evolution in Porygon, which they imaginatively called an Up-Grade.  However, even when Porygon was in cyberspace, they could not manipulate its data enough to make it accept the code.  So, they decided to try trading it while it held a disc containing the code, because why not?  Luckily, it worked.

Not much is known about the original creator of the Dubious Disc, so I cannot speculate much on how exactly it was accepted as an evolutionary tool, or what was wrong with the code.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1e374b,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1e374b/ditto_theory_part_vii_porygon/,

We get very little mention of this again, if any.

Maybe it was just dropped because it was not going anywhere. But what if it wasn't? What if Ash's father DID become a Pokemon master? Ash's father would have went in the 5 regions, capturing Pokemon on a very serious level, seeing the legendaries, always wanting to see more. He learns of every Pokemon and creates the perfect team of Pokemon consisting of only the best of the best. But here is the important part: Ash's father did not include gym battles in his journeys because he did not like the idea of fame despite knowing how well he would do.

All while Ash's father is truly mastering Pokemon, Ash is going on his own journey. Eventually, before Ash entered Unova, Ash's father learns his son will be in the region but rather than wait to meet, Ash's father collects the 8 badges and preps for the Unova league. 

Eventually, Ash will face his father in the Unova league. In the finals. It will be Ash's ULTIMATE test. Beat his rivals in their respective regions? Simple enough. Bur defeating his father, a man that has truly become a Pokemon master, Ash will truly realize his own dream.

We are not told of Ash's father much because deep down Ash is ashamed he has not done enough to become like his father, or at least fears he cannot.

I'll start from the beginning of how I think these two came in to existence in the first place. The answer is [Paras](http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/9846/images/paras.gif). Since Paras is so weak, it would have been destroyed by almost everything else in the wild. Biological evidence has been shown that when a specie is weak, it adapts to survive, or dies. A defence mechanism Paras could have developed is, finding a rock, hollowing it out, and using it as a shield. Just like [this guy](http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/dwebble.jpg). You can't deny that Dwebble without a rock and Paras without it's shrooms looks the same. You may be thinking, what about Foongus? Well, following my aforementioned theory, Paras shed it's shrooms to find a rock. These shrooms could have developed into a new Pokémon, don't ask me how, but it could have. Now, somewhere in Foongus' existence it could have had a run in with a voltorb. Generations of breeding with one until the pokéball pattern emerged; finding a dead voltorb, or an empty voltorb shell and becoming emotionally and then biologically attached, who knows. Or, Foongus' diet could consist of mainly Apricorns, which we all know, are the main ingredient for Pokéballs. You may argue that Apricorns are only native to Johto however, and not Unova where Foongus is present. Paras however, is present in Johto. Paras' transformations would have taken place, causing rise to Dwebble and a pattern-less Foongus. The only explanation I can muster for Dwebble and Foongus not being in Johto or Kanto, where Paras was, is migration, which is both possible and viable. Foongus' apricorn mutations could have taken place whilst in Johto, before it's migration.

EDIT 1: I also notice that Paras' evolved form has a larger version of the features Paras had on its back, a [larger mushroom](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wAlcMBv-oFM/TggQRtgQU1I/AAAAAAAABB0/qk9vbZzfWUA/s1600/Parasect.jpg). Dwebble's evolved form, [Crustle](http://solarblade.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/crustle.png?w=300&amp;h=240), also has a larger version of what Dwebble had. It could suggest that since, according to my theory, Dwebble and Paras are the same Pokémon (aside from what it keeps on it's back) they follow the same patterns when evolving, to simply grow, rather than other evolutionary changes other Pokémon go through such as Dragonair, Eevee, Charmeleon etc.

The permanent residents of said town are those who refused to put pokemon through the brutality of having to battle, or just miserably failed as a trainer. That is how it is fair to everyone.

Charmander = Char(Fire)+Salamander
Squirtle = Squirt (Water)+ Turtle (Some people believe squirrel is involved but I choose to believe otherwise)
And its easy to assume that Bulbasaur is a dinosaur with a bulb on its back. 

I would say Bulbasaur is a surviving dinosaur from the prehistoric ages. To make a real life comparison, it has been proven that alligators and other amphibians root from prehistoric times. This makes me believe that all known fossils are examples of pokemon that 'died' in the prehistoric era, but were eventually revived through technology. 

Also, a large theory regarding the death of the dinosaurs was a loss of plants, causing herbivores to die (eventually killing off carnivores too). Bulbasaur, as a dinosaur with a plant on its back probably doesn't have much of a problem with finding plants.. This is another reason why it could've survived. Bulbasaur and its evolutions were evolved enough to survive. Kind of cool to think of IMO.

Also, all the fossilized pokemon have a rock type. Because Bulbasaur is also considered a 'dinosaur', shouldn't it have a rock element. Rock for dinosaur, and grass for herbivore?

Although there are many fan descriptions of ""official"" Pokemon, I will set them straight. I work on some of the designs for the Company, and I hear rumors around the building, as well as design ( I've only designed two, but I would not like to lose my job telling you ).
The new pokemon revealed are there for a reason, and secretly show new moves and aspects.
""Pangoro"", Pancham's fabled evolution does not exist. It evolves into a Fighting/Dark however, and it gains a sharp mohawk. Schemes are the tanish color and black seen before, as well as a green type mask looking pattern on face and shoulder areas.
Gogoat does not evolve, and has the Base HP stat of 105.
Helioptile does evolve, once. It evolves at level 28, and stays Electric/Normal, gaining a frill.
I do not have information on Clauncher, but I've heard about a Water/Fire evolution. One claw Fire blaster / one claw Water. Still, do not believe me on this one, as I do not know.
Scatterbug is Bug. Spewpa is Bug. They evolve at level 10 then 15.
Skrelp turning into Poison/Water, and has a seaweed cloak. It resembles the Grim Reaper, with a boney rib chest poking out.

A place called ""Tame Park"" lets you put Pokemon in a Daycare like system. You can exchange Pokemon money for PokeTokens, and with those tokens, use them for exchange in EVs or IVs.
There is also a character that uses Poison Pokemon, and challenges you all throughout the game, named ""Tarimaku"" ( not sure what that translates to ).

There are 2 Pseudo-Legendary Pokemon ( Example:  Salamence / Dragonite )
- The first is Fire/Dragon and evolves at 35 then 55. It has long mane, then evolves with flaming mane. It has the new move ""Honor Flame"" ( again, not sure what that translates to in the Americas ) which deals 85 damage with 85% accuracy.
- The other is Ice/Dragon

The starter's are Grass/Dark - Fire/Psychic - Water/Fighting
Chespin gains sharp armor, and learns moves like Rollout and Pin Missile early on. It can roll into a ball with Spins sticking out.
Fennekin evolves into Burnsune at level  17 then 35 ( like the others ). It's fur turns dark red, then black, and resembles fire.
Froakie turns into a sumo-frog, and gains over 181 kg.

Other new Pokemon like a Fairy/Fighting Cyclops, and Dark or Ghost Fossil Pokemon - A Triceratops and a Fish looking one. The Triceratops is named ""Cerimask"" and has a face pattern on its frill. The fish I've heard rumors of around the building, so I'm not sure if they are real or not, but supposedly it's to be a demon/boney fish. Also a Grass/Dark tribal kid that evolves into a chief. The Smoochum family is retyped as Ice/Fairy, and has a new moved called ""Draining Kiss"".

I've been playing pokemon ever since I was 9 years old and got a copy of Red version. To me, one of the things that I loved about the games was the setting, and the almost unspoken things with the world that weren't quite right. It was if the the world of Pokemon was our own world where something had gone wrong, be it a genetic experiments or something like this post http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/72/eb/72ebb8_3562720.jpg.

Gen IV dealt a blow to that in a lot in a lot of ways to me, by basically creating a whole mythology with the legendaries and having pokemon that created the world that these games are set in. While I choose to see the creation stories as appearing due to the loss of history before the events that created pokemon, it's still harder for me to see Pokemon in the same light again.

I really liked Gen IV, it gave me the most playtime in a file until Black 2, determining whether a move is physical or special based on the attack, not the type, and my first and so far only shiny, but to me this creation myth will always be a gripe I have with Gen IV.

Just wondering if anyone else felt this way, or maybe see it in a different light than me. It's a thought I've had for a while and thought it might lead to an interesting discussion.

tl;dr: Gen IV dealt a blow to my view that pokemon is a sci-fi future of our own world.

1350714054.0,49,self.pokemonconspiracies,11semj,"Pokemon societies are actually about saving endangered species, not being the strongest trainer. [Pretty fucking long]",61,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11semj/pokemon_societies_are_actually_about_saving/,"Okay, so this may seem a little far fetched (because it is), but I found this to be more ""realistic"" than other, more awesome theories:

So basically, my idea is you're only a trainer because society (including, whichever form of government exists) wants to save Pokemon, rather than being simply obsessed with winning pointless battles.

Does it really make sense to give a 10-year-old a dangerous animal and tell him to go fight other people with dangerous animals, often in dangerous *areas* entirely? No. Not at all.

However, perhaps there is no real danger, at least not from other people. Perhaps the ""trainer"" gig is only a side-effect, or a means to an end. We know there's been a war in Kanto, that much is pretty much certain. But a war over what? Exactly what is scarce in the pure, perfect world of Pokemon? Pokemon themselves, of course.

Now, there are the common ones, little more than our vermin, like Rattata, who aren't very valuable and indeed are mostly used by kids and criminals (surely too poor to afford or catch rarer pokemon). But there are also the ""legendary"" ones, like Zapdos (hey, I'm old), that are coveted by everyone, that *no one else* has caught, though everyone knows of their existence (which, much like Mammoths, is now more legend than). That's because they are like bald eagles, so rare that the mere sight of them is a gift. Perhaps it was a previous war that caused their scarcity in the first place, or perhaps they are dying out. Think about it, Pokemon have existed *forever*, and society is still obsessed, and I mean OBSESSED with them? Something happened.

So vermin is very common, but the real, useful ones like Machamp (who make great construction workers), are so rare, they cannot be found in the wild. But society needs them, they use them more than technology, for everything from power generation to fire hydrants (water pokemon). Thus the  trainers, leagues, “champions” (after only a day or two of work), to get them . Who better to train useless wimps into strong useful tools than kids who, frankly, have nothing better to do? Go and catch many dangerous animals, because *there is no real danger*. Worst case, you pass out or your Pokemon dies (usually only happens when criminals kill them, see Cubone's mother).

**Real meat**:
Now here's the real meat of this: Most everyone in Pokemon, whilst using animals as basically weapons, doesn't ever kill any of them. Some are evil and want to steal them from you of course, but think about how many fucking Zubats you've encountered. They are everywhere, but you, Red, don't even kill them to save your own life. Probably because Red's been told all Pokemon are precious (they really are), and perhaps because, deep down, he senses that it's not as serious as the whole League charade makes it out to be.

The adults are key here. 1) Most adults are happy to cheerfully write you off or mock you (with their canines of supposedly mass destruction pointed at you). As if they know something you don't. As if your whole purpose in life (at age *fucking 10*) was not something to be taken seriously. They know. They know it's all a trick, a kid's tale. They grow up to see Santa die. They become scientists, hikers, janitors. They're still happy to do their part to save the Pokemon (carry balls to fight kids), who are so dangerously close to extinction, but only the most hardcore become part of it, much like only the most serious eco-friendly person will actually make a career out of it. 2) We know from Black 2 that leaders (adults) are *not* using their real Pokemon, because after you beat the (10-year-old easy) elite 4, the goal is not to win anymore, the charade is off and they tell you the truth about Santa Claus. Hey, you've reached the end of the Plastic Labyrinth, you're now a recycling master!

Pokemon are very serious. Being a trainer actually isn't, another reason why most “trainers” are more busy goofing off than getting stronger. Hell, in Black 2, people are actually *concerned* about how seriously Hugh is taking this ""purpose in life"" thing. Also, people are also obsessed about the bond between people and their Pokemon because while there is always time for them to get stronger, they must be acquainted with humans in order to be truly useful to them... Plus they make good pets.

Now, remember when I said there is no real danger? Still, how is everyone so goddamn okay with letting kids play with things that can burn your house down? Perhaps the whole islands are wildlife reserves (remember, a lot of rare pokemon thrive in cities). Perhaps everyone is so goddamn friendly and everything is so goddamn nice because it's built that way. That would explain why no one gives a shit that you're travelling deep into “dangerous” caves (that supposedly no one has visited before even though there's Potions and shit lying around everywhere). The rarer the Pokemon, the greater it is, and boy do they drive that point home, with the binoculars, the books, the legends... That would also explain why travelling is so goddamn restricted, people don't want you losing the precious fruit of your lie-fuelled labour, and they don't want you introducing your PMD into real, actual society. That would *also* explain why “Poke” is such a popular prefix, and why all the islands are ridiculously small. Would explain a lot really. Why are there so few cops, and those that you encounter can either be bribed with Fresh Water or defeated by a 10 year old?

Oh and finally, people are playing mad scientists with genes because there are so few Pokemon left, and so many past species were useful, like we're currently trying to revive mammoths (if mammoths could make your fucking tea). They do it on site, much easier, and there are many people with weapons-grade animals to contain the mess if something goes awry... Which it inevitably does.

So yeah, maybe it's just a wildlife reserve on which you're born (that doubles up as a theme park). They only have reserves within reserves to support the illusion and to put some truly precious Pokemon under close surveillance (Chansey, Scyther).  They tell you trainers are real, until you've done your part (unwittingly), and gathered enough extinct species to deserve the truth about them. Perhaps Pokedexes double up as tracking devices? Perhaps Profs are just managers? (They certainly care the most about Pokemon... and why do they have so much authority?) Perhaps someone profits... I'm open to suggestions. Perhaps I should go to bed.

Well being that the kids are urged to leave the house at the age of 10 to learn to train pokemon, would it not make sense that this is being done to find potential leaders if another war were to break out?

It only makes sense. With so many lost, including Ash's dad, it would be something for kids to look forward to, to be like their fathers. And with the war having such a toll on the regions, the people live in fear of another one breaking out and encourage the kids to partake in this adventure.

I plan on giving my own explanations as to how somethings work. I would like some input and help from the PC community. The storyline will follow that of my soul silver run, but it will become a bit more independent after the elite four.

There seems to be a lack of structured government in the Pokemon world. Not a problem. I've decided that it is a bit of a dark age; people band together in city-states and villages that are ruled by gym leaders. Gyms play a special part in the world; in Asia, martial arts were divided based on their styles. Styles were the law, and you only fought for the style you trained under. This is why there are gyms devoted to one type of pokemon; using different types is not a regular thing.

Team Rocket - Because there is no strong government in the world, criminal organizations are taking the opportunity to seize power. Team rocket is militaristic; grunts who have signed on are typically bottom scale criminals who need money. In this world, real weapons are used in combat, not just pokemo, thus Team Rocket arms certain members with guns. 

I've got some other ideas, but they don't come to mind at the moment. [Here is my character list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yOhzyr6nKRb3uPcrkO8AEsCw4bvqSdo60FPiQaj7f-8/edit)

1373935068.0,51,self.pokemonconspiracies,1idn5t,The transform-state theory [Origin of all Pokémon],68,17,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1idn5t/the_transformstate_theory_origin_of_all_pokémon/,"Well, let's resume a few points:

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Mimic, Mirror Move, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

2. Let's assume Ditto is a failed Mew clone, or at least related to it, like being a breed of some sorts

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3hXmr3wZT0&amp;t=0m27s), you can see that when a pokémon is evolving, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So, this teory is very simple and it explains a lot of things, first:

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew, but two Mew which transformed into couples of pokémon.
2. The other pokémon, being Mew's offspring, retain part of the ability to transform, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process
3. When a pokémon evolves, it is transforming into another, and the limits of the transformation, however, are defined by the species
4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, and that same state can be used to be stored into special computers, also explaining why pokémon like Conkeldurr can get its pillars inside a pokéball: he gets them into the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve, such as in Machop, Prinplup and Tyrogue's cases
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, such as Beldum and Magnemite, don't do that when they are with trainers. They do that when they are on the wild. The *transform state*'s properties allow them to ""duplicate"" themselves after having enough experience points. When they don't have enough experience points they can perform an evolution by merging, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points, a pokémon gets unstable and volatile, being able to tap into its Mew-like powers to get into the transform-state and transform into the next evolutionary stage of its species.
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, in the transform-state, a portion of its experience points are consumed in order to keep that 'form', and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

(the videos are all supposed to start in the precisely right second I'm talking about)

**I'm just feeling like I have uncovered the deepest mystery of the pokémon universe, but that's it!**

1352197036.0,48,self.pokemonconspiracies,12q1bw,My Cubone Theory,84,36,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12q1bw/my_cubone_theory/,"I know there may be a lot of loopholes in hear, but bear with me...its just a hypothesis.
The mother, Kangaskhan, naturally lays two eggs; twins. NOTE: The male Kangaskhan has already abandoned the mother. One twin will be more brawn, and the other will be more intelligent and resourceful. This will always happen. The mother watches over the twins as they develop basic motor skills and perceptional senses over the course of a few months. All is well because the infants are small and can both fit comfortably in her pouch. 

The seasons change, and the mother senses that they must migrate or hibernate...whatever Kangaskhan naturally do. But her pouch is too small for the two toddler Kangaskhan to fit in, so the mother will try to eat the one twin she sees as unfit and weak--the intelligent one. This explains why Marowak can never be as brawny as Kangaskhan, but is adept at using a weapon (the bone) in combat resourcefully. If the baby Kangaskhan is smart enough, it will use its intellect to escape its mother and brother/sister. 

The intelligent Kangaskhan, alone and afraid, instinctively hides, in hope that something will help it. This is why you never see the abandoned young Kangaskhan: it is clever and knows how to hide itself. It is hungry and malnourished, and will die soon if it does not find food. A rogue Marowak discovers the child and takes it under its own care--providing it with food, shelter, and love. The child grows to Cubone's size and is able to call the Marowak its parent, even if it is not, because of the love it is providing. Marowak teaches the young Kangaskhan how to fight with a weapon and survive over, lets say, a year. But Marowak do not live long in the wild; their life expectancy increases drastically only when a trainer obtains and takes care of it, and the surrogate parent becomes less active as a parent.

The surrogate parent Marowak dies in its sleep, leaving the young Kangaskhan behind, once again alone and afraid. It guards it's mother's remains from scavenger Pokemon while mourning it at the same time; its the only way the Kangaskahn feels it can repay its parent for the care it provided. After weeks of guarding the decayed remains, the Kangaskhan realizes that it must survive. It takes the parent's skull, remembering how the parent would nuzzle it, and the humerus, remembering the arms that held and comforted it. Kangaskhan promises itself never to remove or abandon the last of his mother he can hold on to, and, now becoming what we call ""Cubone"", leaves the corpse of its mother behind.

If a trainer does not find and capture the wandering Cubone, it will grow, for it learned well how to fight and survive from Marowak. It grows to adolescence, but its mind is never healed. It feels the burden of leaving the mother's corpse behind, and remembers how it was almost eaten by its mother as a child. Because its mind has not fully matured, Cubone blames it on its ""better"" twin, the one who was chosen by the mother Kangaskhan to survive. Infuriated that it must now live a life of solitude and despair, the angry Cubone trains itself, growing much stronger and much, much more skilled at wielding a bone as a weapon. 

Using its natural instinct and enlightened sense of hunting from Marowak, Cubone does its best to backtrack to where it was born, and is successful. Carefully, Cubone spies on the pack of Kangaskhan. Cubone notices that he is not the only one to have experienced his mother trying to eat him, as he witnesses several other mother Kangaskhan do the same. Angered, Cubone is determined to find its mother and, smelling an almost familiar smell, is able to. Cubone spies obsessively on the family he never had, eyeing its twin with pure hatred and jealousy. Because the brawny twin Kangaskhan is now old enough to start going off on its own, the mother Kangaskhan lets the brawny twin go off hunting. Cubone stalks its twin and clubs it to death with its surrogate mother's bone, taking out all the jealousy and anger it previously had. Leaving the body behind, Cubone feels no better for what it did, and hides. Eventually, Cubone's original mother finds the body and panics, alerting the rest of her pack to her massacred child's remains. The rest of the Kangaskhan become overly protective of the young they didn't eat (the origin of Kangaskhan's obsessive behavior with its child). 

Eventually, the mother will leave, either to try to breed again if it is a dull creature or to live the rest of its life in solitude. Cubone will emerge from its hiding place and, either because of its brute, Kangaskhan nature or because it wants to honor and hold on to the twin it defeated, will remove the skull of the brawny twin (this skull is more comfortable, as the twin was the same size as Cubone...also, this is why Marowak's ""helmet"" doesn't look as crappy as Cubone's) and puts Marowak's skull on the ground next to the twin.

Desensitized, Cubone has become Marowak, a furious but passionate fighter. With the despair that it was chosen as the inferior twin by its mother, was left alone when its Marowak mother died, had to carry its mother's remains alone (which it still does), and murdered its brawny twin Kangaskhan in cold blood (and took his remains as well), Marowak punishes itself by malnourishment and sometimes even starvation, leading to its early death. But it is not done yet.

With the knowledge that other Kangaskhan children are experiencing what Marowak once experienced, Marowak wanders the surrounding area in search of one it can call its own, so that it may provide the child with a better life than Marowak had, continuing the Kangaskhan--Cubone--Marowak cycle successfully.

If a trainer caught the Cubone, the Cubone would grow up happier, having someone constantly taking care of them. For comfort purposes when it is not fighting at its trainer's side, Cubone uses its mother's bone to thin the skull it wears, smoothing and filing it to make it look the way Marowak's skull helmet looks. Marowak, in this case, would live to lvl 100 because it has all the necessary skills to survive and never has to go through killing its twin, therefore being happier. Theoretically, if one were to catch Marowak in the wild (which i cant remember if thats possible or not), the trainer would realistically struggle with Marowak at first, but the Marowak would learn to forget all that had already happened, and would appreciate its new life. 

The Day Care centers across the world know this cycle, and recognize it as deprivation of the Pokemon's life. Because Kangaskhan are easy to fool, one of the Day Care experts will fool the mother and kidnap one of the eggs it hatches, keeping one for themselves or perhaps a ""Lost Twin Trainer"" somewhere else, and giving the other egg to you.

TL;DR: Cubone was seen by its Kangaskhan mother as the inferior of the mother's twins. It ran away and was adopted by a Marowak that experienced the same thing. Marowak dies after teaching the inferior child survival skills. Cubone takes the adopted parent's skull and bone and hunts down and kills its superior twin. Becoming Marowak after taking the superior twin's skull, it roams the earth in search of other inferior twins so that it may give them a better life, while punishing itself for having lived such a life, which makes it die young.

just a thought I had while playing heart gold so its a work in progress

Also the reason your player doesn't have to face this horrifying choice could be because you are performing valuable research for the professor of your region and are deemed to useful by the apparently horrifyingly cruel pokemon government (Although I suppose this is less horrifying than a world in which everyone has god like powers at their disposal )

Possible Supporting Theory 1: All Pokemon were contrived as weapons and the world was ravaged by a bio-weapon war, legendary Pokemon were created as super weapons and proved tough to control.

Possible Supporting Theory 2: Animals quickly mutated due to some other unforeseen event. They can now rapidly reproduce and out compete conventional animals, this quick reproduction also allows for mutations to occur at a much faster rate. However, there are to many animals to safely sustain. This has depleted tons of resources, leading to the possible armagedon situation, where the few humans left had no reason to keep history and so the history of the world before was destroyed.

Both of these theories would support the advanced technology in the Pokemon world. Pokeballs were derived from a control device that was once used to either try to control the population of Pokemon or to control Pokemon for use in the war.

Some additional evidence comes from the [mention of conventional animals](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Animals_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world) in the anime, books, and games. This could be what's left of the old world history.

The Pokemon's High reproduction rate does not mean that they have shorter life spans. We see most live alongside people for most of their lives, and some outlive people. This would explain how common Pokemon encounters are compared to animal encounters today. This would also explain the span of history in the Pokemon world.

We can assume all the people that survived this event came from one country since the languages do not differ between regions and nobody has trouble talking to anyone else or at least, the group that branched out all came from one country and passed on their language to others that survived.

This was caused by the petty squabbles between Unova's first princes. 

My theory is that the tale, while true, should be thought of in mythic terms. 

The two princes are not princes in the traditional sense, but the concepts of Truth and Ideals. The elder prince is said to believe in Truth because he *is* truth, and likewise with the younger prince and Ideals. Truth takes the side of the elder prince because long before the first ideals were formed, Truth existed.

The mega-God Pokemon was torn between these two ideals. Being a God, this happened both figuratively and literally. The Ur-Pokemon was so torn by his indecision that his soul split into two halves, which then departed from his body. His body fell from a great height (as an icy meteorite), forming the Giant Chasm. Thus, both accounts of Kyurem's origin are true.

The two God-Halves made war against each other, neither conquering the other. Eventually, the two God-Halves Reshiram and Zekrom decided to compromise.

With their combined powers, they formed an island in the heart of Unova. This island became the Entralink. The Entralink was a place where dreams (representing Ideals) could become reality (representing Truth). Thus, the Dream World came into existence.

Now, the first settlers of Unova learned of this legend somehow, albeit in a distorted form with the last part edited out. Perhaps Reshiram and Zekrom told them, so that they would not make the same mistake.

If the above is true, then they failed spectacularly. Those who sided with Truth (metaphorically the ""sons"" of the elder brother Truth) fought against those who sided with Ideals (again, metaphorically the ""sons"" of the younger brother Ideals), and the battle started anew. Eventually, the two God-Halves Reshiram and Zekrom stepped in and lay waste to the continent.

Reshiram and Zekrom became ""inert"" after this period, becoming the Light Stone and Dark Stone. But when one is awakened, the other must awaken too.

It's somewhat new, so it is not necessarily fully thought out yet. I look forward to critiques.

We've all heard of the theory about how the Pokedex is written by children, and hence is likely to possess some over-exaggerations and hyperbole. However, what is often overlooked is how the Pokedex has changed over the many generations.

In the first games, Professor Oak clearly gives the pokedex to Red and Green, stating that they are to fulfill his dream of completing the ""pokemon encyclopedia"" (implying that some data has already been recorded by Professor Oak himself), and they are then set on their way. It can therefore be assumed that the data that is recorded by the Pokedexes in the first Generation games are either local storage only, or their data banks are kept only by the Professor, and maybe accessed by other Professors. 

In the later generations, however, the pokedexes are continued to be given out, usually by Professors, to many different trainers. Even by the second Generation, there are likely many more trainers with Pokedexes, each possessing new information.

Here comes the kicker: why? What use does an encyclopedia serve if the information is only given up after the pokemon is caught? The most obvious answer is that the protagonists themselves are filling in the information, but that begs the question why the lore isn't updated more regularly. 

I instead posit a counter-theory: the Pokedexes, as originally conceived, were designed to be a tracking device to monitor Red and Green. Oak, worried about his grandson and his grandson's best friend, gives them a device that tracks their whereabouts, records what kinds of creatures they have seen, and relays this back to him. He is thus able to keep a check on them (which also explains why his aides pop up ahead of you in the games). 

However, there is an extenuation on this theory. In later generations, many more trainers possess pokedexes. They have kept their original design (to allow parents, and perhaps scientists, to track their children), but also act as a kind of personal forum for the trainers. As new pokemon are encountered, the trainers can see what other people have learned about the same pokemon. When rare finds are discovered, it's more or less a bonus.

And, let's extrapolate further. If the Pokedex is intended to primarily track the location of the trainer, and is usually given out by Professors to trainers whose parents have requested they receive one, why not unlock all the entries at once? Wouldn't that make traveling easier for the trainers?

The answer that I come up with is that the ""adventuring"" part of a trainer's life is to prime them for adulthood. It is, at its most basic, a rite of passage. As can be seen in Black and White, both Cheren and Bianca learn what they want to do in life from the lessons they learned while traveling. 

(Certainly, there seem to be many trainers out there, but most of them have discovered their callings. They are children having fun, archaeologists, breeders, Rangers, cameramen and more. You do find some trainers who are specifically trying to get better at battling (Ace Trainers), but most have already decided upon other avenues. However, this is a tangent and a theory for another post.) 

The Pokedex can thus be seen as a part of that rite of passage. It is a recording of the child's journey, a way to connect with others on the same journey, and a way grow as a person. Sure, the entries might not be exact, but they fuel the imagination and foster a desire to learn more.

**tl;dr** The Pokedex is an elaborate tracking device to ease the minds of parents and give scientists useful data about trainers.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1600zo,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1600zo/the_role_of_the_pokedex/,
1354696593.0,46,self.pokemonconspiracies,14bc3r,Unova Mythology - [Black 2 White 2 Spoilers],62,16,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/14bc3r/unova_mythology_black_2_white_2_spoilers/,"Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem have still not had their story fully told. Reshiram and Zekrom were said to once be an original dragon that had split because of two brothers who ruled over Unova but clashed their beliefs, one in ideals, and one in truth.

In Black 2 and White 2, Kyurem fuses with both Reshiram and Zekrom(only one at a time). This goes along with the very popular theory that Kyurem was also a part of the original dragon(typically the corpse). But why haven’t we gotten to see the original dragon if they can fuse with it?

Another untold story is that of the Abyssal Ruins. Now a while ago before Black 2 and White 2 were announced, I found an interesting theory thread involving them, about how the numbers in the final passage correspond with the final digit of Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem’s numbers in the National Pokedex.

“King defeated ③ alone.④ joined King in a day.King called ⑤ beings.King is hope and future.The great King ⑥.”

Which read, filled in:

King defeated Reshiram alone.
Zekrom joined King in a day.
King called Landorus beings.
King is hope and future.
The great King Kyurem.


However, I found an interesting read that revealed another fact that was not in the original theory I read. In Black and White, the numbers of ③ and ④  are swapped between versions. So with this swap it would read:

King defeated Zekrom alone.
Reshiram joined King in a day.
King called Landorus beings.
King is hope and future.
The great King Kyurem.

There is no doubt in my mind that this was intentional and that the first two numbers are related to Zekrom, Reshiram, or their respective Heros(which would change with each version).

Side Note: N is Team Plasma’s King in Black and White

Now that Landorus beings part is interesting. This would refer to the entire Kami trio of course, since it’s plural, but Landorus is most likely referenced due to being the trio master of the Kami Trio. The Kami Trio seem to be sneaking around in the background of the story trying to seem like something arbitrary and not so important. But they have became slightly more important. They received alternate forms.

In the Japanese versions, these forms they received are named “Sacred Beast formes”. Now in the Abundant Shrine Landorus is worshipped(or feared) for being the being dominant over Agriculture, and also the one who is dominant over the destructive weather-controlling Pokemon Tornadus and Thundurus.

Due to his status as the being who dominates Agriculture, Landorus must have been worshipped for a long time. He must have been known back when the Abyssal Ruins were not Ruins. I believe that the Abyssal Ruins were actually the castle that the winning brother of the conflict(more on this bit later) fought from, and the King referred to in the myth was that brother.

If the King was the winning brother, that would mean that in the respective version, he defeated the respective dragon, teamed up with his dragon, and called down the Sacred Kami Trio to clean up the mess from their fighting. Tornadus and Thundurus would put out fires and clean up wreckage, and Landorus would re-fertilize Unova wherever it was no longer possible for wild-life and plant-life to live.

On top of this, the anime provided more evidence pointing to this, showing that the reveal glass, which changes the Kami trio into their therian formes, rested in the Abyssal Ruins. In Black 2 and White 2, it was stated that in the time they were revered and ""caused trouble"", they were in their therian formes, supporting the winning brother summoning them and transforming them to clean up the aftermath of the war.

Side Note: I have no real good interpretation of how to fit “King Kyurem” into this. I’m just including that from that first theorist’s interpretation.

I’d also like to note that Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion fought against humans to protect Pokemon during a human war. This could be the very war that came from the brothers’ fighting. This would partially explain why Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion randomly showed up in Black 2 and White 2 in the wild, as they hate war.

Now back to my earlier point.

The Abyssal Ruins and the Relic Castle were Castles each ruled by the brothers in the myth in Black and White. Like I mentioned before, the Abyssal ruins had a piece at the end talking about a King, with the numbers 3 and 4 switched depending on your version.

Since this castle praises its king, the Abyssal Ruins had to be home to the winner of the confrontation between the brothers. This would leave the Relic Castle to be home to the loser. Now the player’s dragon, which would be assumed to be the loser’s dragon, is found in the Nacrene museum, which was excavated from the Relic Castle.

Now the Winner’s dragon you would expect to be in the Abyssal Ruins, but instead it was found in Dragonspiral tower. However, the Dragonspiral tower was the original castle(the one the brothers ruled Unova from before their fight), or a piece of it. Now I bet you’re thinking, why would the castle be there and why are there no ruins? Well I stumbled upon one of the most subtle things ever. Dragonspiral tower looms over the town where the ice gym was located in Pokemon Black and White.

What do you think of when you hear Dragon and Ice? Supereffective? WRONG! In reference to the story anyways, you should think Kyurem, the Dragon/Ice Legendary that is the mascot of Black 2 and White 2 and can fuse with the two known residents of DragonSpiral tower, Reshiram and Zekrom.

The two brothers fought and the Winner would go on to rule Unova from that central castle, and would lay the loser to rest in the Relic Castle, with his defeated Pokemon. The victor would go to bring his resting Pokemon in the form of the Light/Dark Stone to the Castle where the original dragon once ruled, where the DragonSpiral Tower now stands and the loser's dragon would end up in the desert to later be discovered by the Nacrene museum in the form of the Dark/Light Stone.

    Side note: Slightly solidified that the winning dragon’s master was of the Abyssal Ruins. In Black 2 and White 2 you are given notes written by Ghetsis that decipher the Abyssal Ruins’ text for you, meaning he was researching them, and that dragon, according to my theory, ends up in DragonSpiral Tower, where N receives it.

Now in Lacunosa town, they have some legends about Kyurem and how it came down on a comet and ate people. Kyurem did in fact come down in the form of a comet, but in its original form pre-split, and that’s how the brothers found the Original Dragon and used it to rule Unova. After the split, the body(Kyurem) returned to the only other place it knew, the landing site of its comet.

Kyurem was mistakenly believed to be eating people as it would lure people in to the Giant Chasm and task them with trying to ressurect Reshiram and Zekrom for him to fuse with. This could be why Ghetsis went on this crazy quest. Assuming he’s from Lacunosa town, Ghetsis would have been lured in, and never seen again as he searched the world for a plan to ressurrect Reshiram/Zekrom and then enacted that plan through N. Technically it worked by the culmination of his plan in Black 2 and White 2.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_14bc3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/14bc3r/unova_mythology_black_2_white_2_spoilers/,
1350520263.0,43,self.pokemonconspiracies,11ntwa,The PokemonSetting is actually an aritifical dome which serves as a T.V. show watched by billions of fans,82,39,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11ntwa/the_pokemonsetting_is_actually_an_aritifical_dome/,"This post draws heavily from elements of the Truman Show, in case you haven't noticed.


**Background**

The pokemon world takes place in a highly advanced, industrialized future that has caused all pokemon species to become endangered (and extinct, the case of aerodactyl or kabutops). The scientists living in this future created technologies such as pokeballs to help preserve species of pokemon, but it didn't make up for replacing their natural habitats for huge cityscapes that look kind of like Castelia City.
As a result, what they did was construct large domes that created a world for pokemon to live in. They grew grass areas, carved mountains, created man-made caves, and even filled in giant swimming pools to create oceans, all for the existence of the remaining pokemon. These were large domes, but they were incredibly expensive, so in order to make this endeavor profitable, they created a TV show around one boy in his quest to train and battle pokemon and eventually rise to become the best. Cameras are everywhere in the dome, so you'll always be watched by billions of fans.



**Geography of the domes**


Highly sophisticated towns were created for the sake of the show, but overall, most of the natural beauty of the pokemon habitats are kept intact, as you'll find huge gaps between cities that contain only grass, water, and mountains. This seems kind of too perfect to me, as the technology in Pokemon is clearly incredibly advanced, but they don't go beyond the a certain area limit in each city to create more buildings. They probably also don't create more buildings because the population is static, as everyone is an actor.

This is especially obvious in the Unova region, as the map seems kind of too symmetrical for that to be a coincidence. In addition, like in the game, there is a wall that prevents you from going into areas that go past the map, fitting into the whole dome theory.
To fit into the show, every town seems cookie cutter with a pokemon center that will charitably heal your pokemon for free (encouraging you to battle) and pokemarts (so you can buy pokeballs to catch more pokemon to make the show exciting).

I also found it weird that pokemarts exist outside of Safari's. The Pokemon World itself is practically a safari for people to catch pokemon, so why catch pokemon in Safaris? Maybe their put in place specifically to keep the main character illusioned of his role in the artifically created world.



**The NPCs in the show**


Everyone hired to play as the background cast are always willing to help out the main character. Simply by just talking to them, they'll throw TMs, HMs, and rods at you, encouraging you along your journey in the T.V. show. The way Alder, previous Pokemon Champion, leaps off the little mountain seems like he was scripted to talk to you as you've only just begun your journey. The reporter and cameraman you meet are never facing each other, and in fact, are only looking in one single direction, perhaps trying to interview you on your progress. Characters such as Bianca, Blue, etc... are hired as rivals in your journey, similar to Marlon who plays Jim Carrey's best friend in the Truman Show.

Other than you're rival, no other pokemon trainer seems to have the drive to be the pokemon master except for you, because they are paid to only play background actors and they know the harsh reality of the outside world.
Red was a main character that realized the true nature of the Pokemon World, and as a result, he fled to an isolated mountain where he won't have to participate in the T.V. show anymore. After Red's disappearance, in order to keep the Kanto region productive, they allowed the Jhoto main character to cross into Kanto.



**Level disparity amongst Pokemons**


Every chosen main character always seems to be starting off at the weakest town with the weakest areas of Pokemon. This seems to be the biggest hint at a dome/scripted world. All the grass areas where Pokemon pop up are neatly kept at the same level, and you'll never find unusual pokemon that's out of the level group that will hurt you, which I find odd because natural selection I believe still applies to Pokemon. In addition, Every gym is specifically installed to challenge you with pokemon in you're level range, as it gives the show the sense of progression and challenge.


The villains in the region are specifically put in place to give the main character an adversary that will make the show exciting. They probably don't actually steal pokemon, as they all have the same exact pokemon that could have been all breeded, and they send in peons in increasing difficulty to battle you. All the trainers in the wilderness are scripted to sit there and challenge you, and you're never going to find any trainer, with pokemon outside your level group. It's also noteworthy you won't find any pokemon trainers in the towns, cities, or near the Pokemon centers, which you think it would be packed with.



**Pokemon affected by Man-made intervention**


Because of how in the past of this world, man has endangered Pokemone species, several pokemon, specifically legendaries, has risen up as guardians that protect the nature /encourage fertility, such as celebi, regigigas, manaphy, the lake guardians, shaymin...etc...



**Why?**


Breaking the flow of the conspiracy here, but if the Pokemon games have become this large and profitable, imagine a 24/7 broadcast with real pokemon fighting with billions of people watching. In a world where Pokemon are valued so highly but are endangered due to the industrailized progress of man kind, people would definitely watch the story of one boy rising up to become a Pokemon Master as it would remind them of simpler times when the world wasn't so chaotic. From the point-of-view of you, the main character, the world of Pokemon is a quest that only you seem to be involved in. From the point-of-view of the audience, it will be a story that will give you the ultimate feels as everyone would wish they could go back and fix the destruction they caused.


**Wrapping this up before it gets too long**


This post isn't as well structured as other posts, as its just a list of ideas that popped into my brain as I was watching the Truman Show the other day. It's also possible to unify this theory with other theories, such as the war in Kanto or speculations on the existence of Pokemon Centers, gyms, etc...
One last bit of conspiracy thought. In the game, you never meet your father. That's probably because he was removed of the show; :O gasp. The only reason why you'll probably never meet your father in the game is because that will break the illusion of the dome and throw your main character in state of shock.

We all have plenty of experience with Pokéballs, yet it's never explained how they work. Here's what we've got so far:

* There are two halves to a Pokéball, which is a spherical object

* They can be separated into two halves

* There are three main kinds, the Pokéball, the Great Ball and the Ultra Ball. There are various specialist Pokéballs, there are Pokéballs created from Apricorns and there is a rare, limited kind of Pokéball known as the Master Ball, which cannot fail at capturing a Pokémon

* To capture a Pokémon, a Pokéball needs to hit a Pokémon; depending on universe, if a capture fails you either can or can't pick up and re-use the Pokéball

* Pokéballs are capable of containing Pokémon many thousand times larger and heavier than the ball itself, and are capable of migitating any weight that a Pokémon might have (I can't see myself walk around with a Metagross hanging from my hip)

* Pokéballs function indiscriminantly: the Pokémon itself cannot say 'no', perchance, to an attempted capture. It has been recorded many times that a Pokémon willingly gets captured (or captures itself, good job Minccino and Psyduck) in the anime, but it doesn't give them the choice to say no

* Pokéballs, as the name suggests, only works on everything that is classified as a Pokémon. Pokéballs cannot capture humans or items, although a Pokéball is used as an item icon in the overworld for the games.

* Pokéballs are produced by Silph Co.

Now, on to my theory.

The Pokéball, as a whole, evolved from a trade in which a smith-like person fashioned a sphere using a certain technique from an Apricorn. They unscrewed a lid, which summoned a Pokémon, but this is not absolute as the only place this has been shown is in Pokémon 4ever, and we won't be referring to this as canon (the anime doesn't, so why should we?)

At some point, Silph Co. decided to universalise the technology in a more friendly format, starting what I refer to as the Pokéboom. Following the Pokéboom, concepts like ""Trainers"" and ""Co-ordinators"" came into existence, and Pokéballs developed along with these people.

Now. Look at the [Pokéballs](http://www.google.co.jp/imgres?imgurl=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0JgMCR7jqt0/UHXR_CMFF5I/AAAAAAAAAPc/50yLyHyTHs4/s1600/Pokeballs_yet_more_models_by_BionicleGahlok.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://skysiez.blogspot.com/2012/10/awesome-real-life-pokeballs.html&amp;h=768&amp;w=1024&amp;sz=288&amp;tbnid=etMVUDSMh3bdeM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=120&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__gm1w829F-dpf4_2xQ-pfCmpDErI=&amp;docid=FQbtTLKH5GavqM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zeexUbe4D4imkwX-h4DACA&amp;ved=0CDkQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=1776). Apart from the Cherish Ball, an Event-only ball used for distribution of Event-Pokémon, and the GS Ball, an anime exclusive to justify Ash's travels through the Orange Islands, all Pokéballs are mainly white on the bottom. The main difference between them all lies in the top half; this indicates that the bottom is an essential compartment to a Pokéball. I believe that this is the part that enables the containing of Pokémon.

The top half includes all the technical aspects to the capturing of the Pokémon, and to differenciate between different ball types, the designs are different.

I'd elaborate further, but there really isn't much else to say about it.

This theory is somewhat reliant on my earlier one, which I've linked to at the bottom.

import PokemonPolitics.*;

Back a long time ago, Pokemon were hard to domesticate. You either had to have access to good Apricorns, or be able to befriend one without catching it. When development began on the Pokeball, the government(s) subsidized development of the Pokeballs and the accompanying PC storage system. Why?

-Pokeballs made ownership of a Pokemon much easier. You can just weaken it and throw a ball instead of having to befriend it the old-fashioned way. And unlike an Apricorn, Pokeballs can be cheaply mass-produced, so no worries if the first one doesn't work. Apricorns, on the other hand, are relatively rare, and can only be made into Pokemon storage devices by the work of a skilled craftsman.

-To regulate Trainers. As it became easier to own Pokemon, the government would want to be able to make sure only licensed Trainers were out catching Pokemon, and that no abuse or theft was going on. By keeping an eye on everyone's boxes, the E4 could at least catch major discrepancies. Also, the Pokemon belonging to criminals could be ""frozen"" (like a bank account) so as to prevent the criminals using them. Going off this, this could explain why a lot of Team Rocket members only have a few Pokemon. In fact, to the best of my memory, almost none of them had 6. By only keeping a few Pokemon, they wouldn't have to use the PC system, thus escaping the oversight of the E4.

-Research purposes. The regional Professor would be able to gain a lot of useful data by observing trends about which Pokemon are caught, and where.

-It helped the economy. More Pokeballs meant more domesticated Pokemon and Trainers, which meant a huge lift to the economy, through PokeMarts, TM/HM sales, Move Tutors, Daycare/Breeding, more jobs for Pokemon Centers, etc.

So that's why the government subsidized Pokeballs and oversees the PC network. True, Pokeballs let criminals also acquire Pokemon more easily, but the other benefits may have outweighed that detriment in the E4's eyes, and using the PC system to monitor activity might at least force big-time criminals to move their gains in a less-efficient manner.

Where does Team Rocket come into this? Team Rocket's stated goal is domination through Pokemon. They have many times attempted to gain Pokemon to use. (They also tried to presumably capture the Master Ball, which they could have used to catch legendaries.) But what if they didn't want to steal the old way. What if they were just gearing up and preparing for catching ALL the Pokemon. That's right: the next move of Team Rocket would have been to storm the Pokemon League, and take control of the PC network. (In previous posts*, I've already stated my idea that the reason the League is isolated, guarded by tough Pokemon and the best trainers, is because the final room holds the mainframe of the PC network.) Part of the plan was for their leader, Giovanni, to gain control of the Viridian Gym as a staging ground. Once Team Rocket had finished their preliminary buildup of troops, they would gather quietly at Viridian Gym. They could either pass through Victory Road, or Giovanni could fly troops to wait in hiding outside the League. Once their troops were in place, they would quickly seize the League, and use the computers to take everyone's Pokemon. With almost all the Pokemon in the world seized, and people unable to catch more (not many people would have access to apricorns or be able to befriend Pokemon in the old way), Team Rocket would have conquered Kanto. After a few years, they truly could have taken over the world.

However, this didn't play out quite as planned. Red ruined Team Rocket's training/theft at Mt. Moon. He screwed up their recruitment on Nugget Bridge. He rescued Bill, whom Team Rocket turned into a Clefairy to try to make sure he couldn't use a backdoor in the system to keep them out of the PCs. He took out their main source of income when he cleared the Game Corner basement out, and stole the valuable Silph Scope, which could have been used to capture Ghost Pokemon to counter Agatha's. He rescued Mr. Fuji, who could have given then Pokemon to use, or helped train theirs. He defeated them at Silph, and took the Master Ball so they couldn't. Even with all these setbacks, Giovanni was still going to try to take the League. And then guess what happened? Red shows up at Viridian, and destroys any last hope Team Rocket might have had of conquering Kanto. They still might have been able to do it, even after all their operations had been wrecked by this kid. But with their forces defeated, their leader outed, and their secret base revealed, they were done for.

The kicker? After all this, Red gives one last parting shot to Giovanni. He challenges the Pokemon League, and becomes Champion. He sends a message to Giovanni and any other ambitious Rocket leaders: ""If you want to take Kanto, you're going to have to go through me."" Red has the talent to become Champion, the morals of an Eagle Scout, and the dedication of a pianist. He takes the Championship not for his own fame, but to use his power and his team for good; to make sure that he will be standing in Team Rocket's way. Red claiming the title of Champion, and their subsequent defeat in the Sevii Isles, are the final nails in Team Rocket's coffin. After making sure Team Rocket is finished in Kanto, Red then allows Lance to claim the title of Champion, and goes off to Mt. Silver.

He's not just on vacation. Red is a true hero - one who doesn't want fame or power, but protects the people of Kanto, simply because it is the right thing to do. However, once he saw the threat was eliminated, he left to live in peace - but he didn't go far. At Mt. Silver, he's still in contact with League Members. If there's any hint of Team Rocket threatening the Indigo Plateau again, then he'll be ready to come out of retirement.

After being defeated by Gold, Red simply flies away, to start a new life elsewhere. He knows that Gold can take up his task of keeping the region safe. He knows he's no longer needed.

-End Credits roll-

Summary: Pokeballs let the E4 regulate the region and help the economy, but provide an opening for Team Rocket to take control of Kanto's Pokemon if they can take the League. Red kicks their butts all across Kanto, then becomes Champion to make sure they can't try again. Red is the Dark Knight, and Gold becomes his Robin.

He helped me tackle the issue of how a Pokéball is able to brainwash a Pokémon into total loyalty to the person who catches.

If a Pokéball was real, it would be nothing short of incredible. The damn thing can shrink/grow in size, absorb a living organism inside itself via energy beam, can heal an organism when attached to a Pokémon center and teleports from point A to B when you have more than six Pokémon on your persona. But even when suspending disbelief, mind control via technology is still a very difficult feat for a piece of machinery that is sold cheap to the general public. 

So we talked and talked and I think we figured out how a Pokéball can make a Pokémon instantly loyal to who ever traps it in that ball.

Our conclusion: **it doesn’t.** The Pokémon stays of its own freewill.

Say you are a wild Pokémon. You live in a forest with hundreds of other “competing” Pokémon. You’re most likely un-evolved, of a relatively low level, and know the most basic of moves. On top of finding food, water, shelter and other Pokémon of the same species, you also have to fend off different Pokémon that may want to eat you or are territorial.

In addition to the weather, changing seasons and type disadvantage, status aliments that afflict you can’t be healed. If you get paralyzed in the wild, you stay paralyzed (see Entei, Raikou Suicune).

*Then* consider reproduction. Pokémon of a higher level are more likely to survive, and the more evolved a Pokémon is, the more powerful it is (presumably) and thus the more likely it is to survive in the wild, attract the opposite sex, mate, fend of predators, protect its young and live longer. But leveling up in the wild is hard. You all know it’s easier to level-grind by battling other trainers than wild Pokémon. Even with the benefits of EV training, it takes forever.

In short, the Poké-world is still an ecosystem and outside of the Pokéball , the Darwinian Contest continues.

As a wild Pokémon, life sucks. You have to worry about not getting eaten every day while still needing to eat yourself, meanwhile the local Ivysaur stole your Bellspourt girlfriend cause that douche knows Razor Leaf.

Then one day, a human enters your forest. He has a Pokémon with him, one you’ve never seen before, and orders it to attack you. *This* Pokémon is tougher than anyone in the forest and has his sights set on you. He kicks your ass, but doesn’t kill you. Maybe he’s showing off how strong he is? The human throws a ball at you and you get sucked inside. You try to break free, as anyone would, but eventually it closes up and doesn’t open again. You are injured. You think death is coming.

One trip to the Pokémon Center and suddenly, you are healed! Just like that. Magically. Like it never happened.

The human doesn’t eat you. Instead, he gives you a place to sleep, gives you food, heals you every time you get hurt, and gives shows you (holy shit, what?!) kindness and compassion. *And* you’re hanging out with five other Pokémon that are pretty chill, unlike that douche Ivysaur.

In return, the human only asks that you defend him when he needs it. He picks fights often, but they are usually with Pokémon weaker than you or ones with type disadvantages so you can beat them. Sure, fainting sucks, but he saves you when that happens. No one eats you whilst you’re unconscious.

He never abandons you, believes in you, and occasionally gets you laid at that Day-Care Center.

We (my pal and I) figured that the Pokéball merely encases the Pokémon, assigns a trainer ID to it and syncs that Pokémon to that particular ball. There is no mind-control involved.

We reasoned that at first, a captured Pokémon doesn’t like his owner, then sees what a sweet deal is presented to it and it tolerates the trainer, then respects the trainer, then likes him/her, then sees the trainer as family.

If you look at Pokémon like they are animals, it is in their best interest to be caught. If they train, they are more likely to evolve (this is crucial to a Pokémon that needs a stone to evolve), significantly more likely to live longer, able to breed multiple times in a non-threatening environment, are safer than they would be in the wild, and can learn attacks that they would never learn on their own (via TMs/HMs).

[This article here](http://www.aolnews.com/2009/11/06/did-we-domesticate-dogs-or-did-dogs-domesticate-us/) suggests that dogs came into human culture because they saw the advantages of living in civilization. The same is implied for cats (who use us every day and cat owners know this) and other species we have domesticated. *They* came to *us*, or at the very least stayed with us because we had more to offer than the wild did.

You’re Pokémon may see you as a savior from the difficult life of being in the wild. And the Pokéball is not a brainwashing, slavery-inducing thing. It’s a technological marvel that prepares a wild animal for domestication.

So, in short, PETA can take a long walk off a short bridge.

**TL;DR:** A Pokéball merely registers a Pokémon, does not brainwash them. A Pokémon stays with a trainer because it wants to because they get a lot out of it. Fuck PETA.

**Edit:** Pokémon that evolve based on their friendship level add to this theory.

This is supported by the constant real world references to places, animals, dates, and people. If you do not like that theory, then this post has nothing of value for you, you might want to turn back now.

Second, this post itself is less of a conspiracy and more so a compilation of facts about the lore of prehistoric Pokemon and how it matches up with real world history. It's made moreso to give you an idea of just what Pokemon were around at what time, and give you an idea of what their world was like. Hopefully from it, you'll be able to learn a few things you hadn't, and form some neat theories with this information. Anyways, let's begin!

*300 Million Years Ago*

This time period is one of the two major times, and is the earliest time currently known when Pokemon appeared on Earth. Just what was the rest of Earth like during this time? Well, 300 Million Years Ago is the time when the Carboniferous Period was about to end, and the beginning of the Permian Period. During this time, giant arthropods ruled the lands, and amphibians were beginning to become dominant on land. Important to note is that just 5 Million Years earlier, a great mass extinction even known as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse happened, causing most of the forests and animals on Earth at the time to disappear. What rainforests remained were on small islands, and due to the climate changing to be dryer, reptiles slowly began to thrive.

Only Three Pokemon (Two Families) were known to exist during this time period.

* Kabuto
* Kabutops
* Genesect

Pretty interesting isn't it? Now, many people believe that Genesect was an altered version of Kabutops, and they have a bunch of similarities, including their time periods. So, assuming this theory was true, then that would make **The Kabuto Family the oldest known Pokemon in existence, not counting mythological Pokemon.**

Now, assuming that Genesect and Kabuto are different, this still shows us some interesting things. The Pokemon of this era were all predatory arthropods, and extremely deadly. Perhaps this was so Pokemon could carve there niche into the ecosystem, allowing for more Pokemon to evolve later? I'll leave that for you guys to speculate on, as it's time to move onto our next major time period in Pokemon.

*100 Million Years Ago*

A large time difference between the last time period, we're now in the Mid-Cretaceous Period. When you think Dinosaurs, you'll most likely think of this time period. it was here the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex roamed, as well as Triceratops, and Velociraptor. Also notable in this time is that Flowering Plants and Grass began to appear. Yup, we didn't have grass before this time period. The More you know! Landmasses were slowly drifting and resembling the world we know today, with some differences. With 35 Million Years till the end of the Cretaceous Period, and Dinosaurs in General, there'll be plenty of time for Pokemon to thrive during this time period!

Only 9 Pokemon (5 Families) were known to be alive during this time period.

* Lileep
* Cradily
* Cranidos
* Rampardos
* Shieldon
* Bastiodon
* Tirtouga
* Carracosta
* Relicanth

Plenty of variation here huh? Here we see a lack of Arthropod Pokemon, and more Reptilian ones instead. Something I feel important to note is that Lileep/Cradily's Pokedex entries are a bit confusing in this area. Some say it was alive during this time period, others say it went extinct at this time. Had Lileep been alive or extinct? Or did it just have a very short-lived existence? One final time period to visit real quick before we get to the fun part!

*10,000 Years Ago*

Again, a very big gap here. It is now nearing the end of the Ice Age, and Humanity is beginning to rise. They'll soon grow into the dominant species on Earth. Also roaming at this time are iconic creatures such as the Wooly Mammoth, Saber Tooth Tiger, and Giant Ground Sloth. Amongst these creatures, a sole Pokemon joins them.

* Mamoswine

Odd huh? This Pokemon isn't in fossils, and isn't in the wild current day, yet existed during this time. It can now be found when teaching a Piloswine Ancient Power. It's important to note that Swinub and Piloswine were not known to exist during this time, only Mamoswine. Did they and we just don't know, or did Mamoswines grow to become Piloswines, and having them know ancient power reverts them to become like their ancestors. If that theory is true, then did Yanmega and Tangrowth exist in the past too?

Now I'm sure you've noticed that some iconic Fossil Pokemon were not listed here. What Pokemon do we know existed in ancient times, yet he have no idea when exactly? Here's the list! In exact, there are 6 known Pokemon (4 Families) that we know existed a long time ago, but not exactly when.

* Shellder
* Cloyster
* Omanyte
* Omastar
* Aerodactyl
* Anorith
* Armaldo
* Archen
* Archeops

First of all, why is Shellder up there? Interestingly enough, they were said to be the natural prey of Omastar in Pokemon Gold's Pokedex of Omastar, so it's interesting to know that Shellder (And presumably Cloyster) has been around for such a long time and as far as we know isn't changed from what is was so many years ago. Just how long ago? We don't know, we do know however it was around at the same time Omastar was.

Aerodactyl was said to be alive during the age of Dinosaurs, which can be anywhere between the Triassic to Cretaceous. As for the rest, we really don't have much of a clue. Perhaps they're in the big gap between Kabutops and Rampardos? Since Rampardos and Bastiodon are from the same Fossil Sets and were alive in the same time period, perhaps other fossil sets would be alive at the same time as their counterparts? This would make sense if it weren't for Aerodactyl, who as alive during Dinosaurs and is in the same Fossil set as Kabutops which as alive waaaay before Dinosaurs appeared.

The Pokemon youtube and Pokemon.com have been very sure to be clear that it's a NEW Pokemon, and not a form. Just one closely related to Mewtwo. So where did it come from? 


A theory that will come into play with this one is that Pokemon X&amp;Y is the genetic generation, representing the X (feminine) and Y (masculine) chromosomes. Supported by the partial double helix on the logo (debatable, of course, but everything at this point is) and the feminine qualities of Xerneas versus the masculine qualities of Yvetal.


Onto the theory:


The evil organization of X&amp;Y know of Mewtwo, like many people of him, and see his power as an asset... But his obedience as a problem. Such a powerful Pokemon is no use to them if it doesn't follow orders. But what if they could make one that did?


So they start the experiments anew, working hard to exactly match all of the remaining reports from the Mewtwo experiments all those years ago - except they do one thing differently. They want a Mewtwo that is subservient, that will follow their orders. Chauvinistically,  they think ""We need female DNA, as they are naturally submissive!"" So they gather from various Pokemon specimens female DNA - XX. 


Of course, they find out they were horribly wrong. Instead of creating a Mewtwo that would follow their orders, they just create a stronger Mewtwo, one with far less empathy for them and their kind. One to rival Mewtwo himself.

First off, I will disclose that I haven't played any pokemon game beyond LG, but I have been pretty interested in the lore and have decently kept up with the conspiracies that were brought up in this sub. I came across this concept while lying in bed one day and I figured I might as well share my thoughts with you guys... see if you can pick apart or add to this theory. Hopefully it's not a repost.

Anways, at least in Gen1 (perhaps also in Gen2), when you saw a pokemon on the world map, or even in your party menu, they would be depicted as a generic bird, seal, snake, dinosaur?, etc [Link](http://lparchive.org/Pokemon-Blue/Update%2006/3-capture_20042010_160107.png).  This led me to think that perhaps these sprites could be used as a basis for grouping pokemon based on their heritage.  

The obvious example would be for the legendary birds, the pidgey family, spearow family, etc., which are all (quite obviously) depicted with the generic bird sprite.  It would be conceivable that based on this, you could conclude that these pokemon all came from a common 'bird type' ancestor.  Where this theory may be relevant is in discounting/rearranging some lineages in pre-existing, 'widely accepted' phylum trees.  If my memory serves me correctly, both charizard and slowbro are depicted by the 'dinosaur' sprite on the world map/party menu - leading me to believe that they could have shared some common ancestor down the way, even though their types are completely different.

Obviously, as newer generations came out, the game mechanics changed and pokemon were able to be depicted in the world map/party with more detail.

They don't have to obey you, as demonstrated when you have a Pokemon of a higher level then you are trained for, or by Pokemon like Slaking.

So I was wondering, what happened to him!! So I said to myself ill try and make my own pokemon biology posts! AAAAANNNND without further ado my Piplup biology post!!!!

Growth: Piplup are born from their egg fairly large at about 5 and a half inches tall. From this in about two to three weeks they reach their normal size of 1ft 4 in, this is considered level one. When they are born their ""cape"" is also much more prevalent already being its full size it can sometimes get in the way of a growing piplup, but it soon stops growing letting the pokemon grow to a comfortable size. 

Diet: As a young piplup they have to eat quite a lot. They are known to dive. For up to ten minutes to catch prey such as magicarp febass remoraid and as they grow and evolve octillery. 

Natural learn set: 

Pound- unlike many other pokemon, piplup does not learn tackle, instead it utilizes its beak early on pounding it onto its enemy, inflicting minor damage. 

Bubble- piplup begins learning to use water for attacking, but only able to draw forth bubbles from the foam of the water in its developing water sac.

Peck- A improved version of pound

Bubble beam- not quite able to fire water but able to launch multiple bubbles at once, inflicting more damage.

Whirlpool- now able to use water more effectively, it still can not launch it, it can though use it to imprison enemies. 

Hydro pump- now able to fire water effectively but with lower accuracy

Aqua jet: it fires a hydro pump behind it propelling it forward


Evolution: after 16 levels piplup is able to release rapid growth hormones allowing it to grow drastically, giving it better legs for walking on land and sharper wings. A side effect is that the material from its beak overgrows forming a crest on its head. The species since, has adapted using this to its advantage. After 36 levels prinplup now uses its energy again to grow more. It grows hard platings on its wings and changes its crest into a formidable weapon with three points, remanents of its previous ancestors can be seen as fully evolved empoleon have three mostly useless fingers on the underside of its wing.

Abilities: 
Torrent- when piplup feels he is loes a battle he reduces a small dose of the same hormone it uses to evolve, raising its attack.

Defiant- by nature piplup is very stubborn, if an enemy tries to lower its stats it simply raises its own attack, showing the opponent that it won't back down.

Note: My playing experience only goes up to Gen 3.

This isn’t really a solid theory, just bits and pieces I imagine while playing. This is also quite long.

My idea is that each region is a feudally organized country, similar to Medieval Europe or Japan.

We’ll start at the top, with the Champion. What is his/her role? As Champion of the region, they not only fulfill a role similar to king, but they take on tasks that only the greatest trainer of the age could handle. These include the recapturing of Mewtwo, catching certain legendaries such as Kyogre/Groudon to prevent another war of the elements, removing the remainder of Team Rocket from the Sevii Isles, finding out what the hell is going on at the Lake of Rage and similar tasks. The Champion is benevolent dictator, celebrity, and superhero of the region, all in one. (He’s probably also rich too.)

Next come the Elite Four. These would be the Champion’s lieutenants. Their jobs would include defending the League building, which holds control for the entire PC network (all those computers in the final room). The do this both by actually guarding the building, which is built almost like a fortress, and by somehow making sure the Pokemon in Victory Road (and on the sea routes leading to Evergrande City) are strong enough to at least slow down any organization trying to seize the League and the computers in the final room. The E4 would also take on special missions, such as Loreli, Lance and Wallace did. Finally, the E4 would maintain public services like police, Pokemon Centers, PCs, and Trainer services (Ex. Move Deleter, roads outside of cities, ferries, etc.). However, most of the day-to-day oversight would be done by Gym Leaders.

The Gym Leaders are like the lords of their fiefs, which are usually their cities, surrounding routes, and occasionally smaller adjacent towns. Their jobs would basically be the day-to-day jobs of the city, and occasionally other things (Ex. Watson, Jasmine) that need personal attention. Some key, trusted leaders are given the power to dispense HM licenses, which they bundle in with winning the badge.

Trainers usually take one of two paths. The rare one is the Trainer who travels far and wide to become the very best, like Red, Gold, or Brendan. Far more common are trainers who enter into the service of a Gym Leader, as knights served their lords. These trainers take one of two more paths. Some will stay in the Gym, and train with their leader, also testing those who seek to challenge the Gym. Others are posted around the city. All those trainers on the way to Lilycove or wherever are sentinels and guardians for the city and its Gym Leader. Why do the Gym Leaders keep small armies in and around their cities? Because peace is not a given.

In medieval countries, though fiefdoms were part of the same country, they were often at odds over resources or other things, and fought often, both hot and cold wars. In Pokemon, the cities are similar, with each city carefully guarding its borders by posting trainers on surrounding routes and keeping Gym Trainers to guard the city proper. Some cities can protect themselves by being remote (Cianwood, Dewford, Fortree, Mosdeep, Sootopolis, Pacificdlog, Cinnabar.) Others who lack a strong Gym or geographical protection are forced to make alliances. For example, Viridian could protect Pallet, in exchange for favors from Oak. Or, cities like Slateport could be economically beneficial in an alliance, making it a better partner than enemy for Mauville.

Why do these cities fight? It’s not fighting anymore so much as keeping troops because your neighbor has them, and you need to make sure they don’t kidnap the Name Rater, who brings in so many people to your town. If any conflict gets too serious, the E4 will step in, but otherwise, cities are on their own (or with their allies). (However, I do like the idea of some of the past wars being civil.)

Ordinary people are almost everyone else. Some non-Trainers work in Pokemon Centers, with computers, at companies like Silph and Devon, or with more normal jobs. Others, who have some special skill with Pokemon but can’t/don’t want to become Trainers, will take on jobs like Move Tutors, Daycare/Breeding owners, Battle Tent operators, or special tutors like the Name Rater or Move Deleter. These are the people who bring in visitors, and are still very valuable to a city, even if they aren’t Trainers. There would also be a few people like Professors, Bill/Lanette, and Officer Jenny who would be specially appointed by the E4 to work for the nation.

TL;DR: Pokemon lands are like medieval feudal kingdoms. You play as the once-in-a-generation wunderkind of the land. Cities are in a tense standoff constantly. PEACE IS NOT A GIVEN.

Thoughts? I’m happy to try to expand on any of this.

1344582889.0,44,self.pokemonconspiracies,xzivs,Poke-Mythos (A pokemon creation story),59,15,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/xzivs/pokemythos_a_pokemon_creation_story/,"Well, this is my first post here =) Not going to lie, I'm more than a bit nervous, especially since this piece is more poetic than ""This, this, and this make me think this"" type of thing that really belongs here. Still, hope you enjoy it, I tried to create something that summed up the creation of pokemon. (Also, I hope the formatting comes out right *fingers crossed*)


&gt;In the beginning, there was an egg. Out of that egg came Arceus. 

&gt;Arceus created Diagla, and gave it mastery of time.

&gt;Arceus created Palika, and gave it mastery of space.

&gt;Arceus created Giratina, and this was a mistake.



Together, Diagla and Palika created the Universe.

Arceus than created Groudon, who created earth.

Arceus than made Kyogre, who made seas.

This displeased Groudon.



&gt;Angry that he was hidden, Groudon angrily rose up.

&gt;He made continents, and had volacos rise.

&gt;Fighting back, Kyogre made endless rain to flood the lands.

&gt;Arceus than created Raquaza, master of the air and keeper of the peace.



Shocked, that out of the chaos, came the Earth, Arceus was pleased.

Arceus created Regigigas, whose sole duty was to shape the Earth.

And on this Earth, Arceus created Mew, creatures with the ability to become whatever they wished.

Giratina, however, delighted in trouble.



&gt;Raquaza, had created Landorus, to govern weather to bring fertility to the Earth. With the aid of Mew, this brought for Shaymin.

&gt;To guard the sea as it slumbered, Kyogre created Manaphy, which begat Phione.

&gt;From its rest, Groudon created Heatran to roam the land.

&gt;Giratina, used the Mew to create Tornadus and Thundurus as chaotic reflection of Landorus.



Giratina, the trouble maker continued to cause madness, locking Mew in their reflections of other forms.

Landorus, furious at the destruction tornadus and Thundurus were causing, went to Arceus

Arceus, with the aid of Palika and Diagla, locked Giratina away, exhausting Arceus.

Arceus, seeing the chaos his creations had caused, created Latios and Latias to create a species to introduce order.


&gt;Thus, Arceus went to a deep slumber, and told Latios and Latias not to trouble him until their goal was accomplished.

&gt;Diagla create the Celebi as its agents, as Diagla slumbered as well.

&gt;Palika, in an attempt to aid all of creation, created the ever pleasant Jirachi, as Palika slumber as well.

&gt;Latios and Latias carried on in their duty.



The Latios and Latias were created shy away from danger and violence, and to have superior intelligence to aid them in their task.

It took them time, and over that time, many pokemon came to be.

Eventually, the Latios and Latias came up with humans.

But the humans were not good enough.



&gt;Hoping adversity would help shape the humans and aid in bonding with the pokemon, Latios went to the Jirachi, and wished.

&gt;Jirichi summoned Lugia and Ho-Ho. Lugia formed Articuno, and an Ice Age occured. The humans made a statue of a false guardian, which Regigas brought to life. To the pure, Ho-oh brought hope.

&gt;Lugia formed Zapdos, whose storms rid the land of life and ice. The humans used rocky tools to make another statue, which was brought to life. Ho-oh made the rainbow, to show beauty from the storm.

&gt;Lugia formed Moltres. With the intense heat, humans made metal, and from the work, another statue was formed, and life made. Ho-oh did nothing.



The humans, with metals tools and fire of their own, realized an edge over the pokemon, and war broke out.

The humans, learned fear of Regigigas and his power, locked him and his creations away, seperately.

Colabain, Terrakion, Virizion and Keledo went to war with the humans.

Both the Legendary musketeers and Latias went to a Jirachi, one seeking to punish the humans, one seeking peace.



&gt;The Jirachi presented the humans with a box, letting them know they were tasked with guarding it, and as long as it was never opened, they would be fine.

&gt;The humans, however, saw it as a trick and opened it. Out flew Tornadus and Thundurus. However, there was also an egg.

&gt;From the egg came Uxie, Mespirit, and Azelf, who taught the humans true knowledge, emotion, and willpower.

&gt;The Latios and Latias were scared, as the egg was Arceus', and they did not wake him fearing punishment for theivery.


The humans, worked with pokemon, balancing order and chaos. From this great friendship and balance, Kyurem was born.

Kyurem worked with the humans to advance their society,

Together, peace and prosperity was the rule.

Eventually, two human brothers had a disagreement.



&gt;Unable to seek the wisdom of the elusive Latios and Latias, Kyurem split like the human society.

&gt;Reshiram was born, siding with eldest in search of truth. Zekrom was born, siding with youngest in the pursuit of ideals.

&gt;After temporary peace, the pair ravenged the land and then vanished.

&gt;Kyurem's shell would fall from the sky, and peace existed.



Ho-oh saw the way the trainers had acted, and lost faith in humanity. But not hope.

Ho-oh created Suicine, from Vaporeon. Entei, from Flareon. Raiku, from Jolteon.

The trio was to find a trainer pure of heart for Ho-oh.

Ho-oh still awaits.


Writing gets a bit meh at the end, and I did go farther than I intended.

My theory? Meowth is the result of a Chatot and a Meowth or Persian breeding. For some reason, the egg managed to hatch instead of ending up as just not happening. So due to this weird combination of genetics, he was able to inherit Chatter, and just didn't figure out how to use it until later in his life

It could also be why his ability to stand and talk causes Meowzie to reject him. She does call him a freak, after all, so maybe she picked up on him being a crossbreed that shouldn't happen

Also note that in Pokemon 2000 he is able to translate what Pikachu and Zapdos are saying to each other, despite it being through electricity.

What is the explanation behind rare or exclusive Pokémon??? No folks, I'm not talking about Legendaries like the bird trio, the beast trio, other trios or singular Legendaries, I'm talking about Pokémon like Togepi (and its evolutions), Castform, Spiritomb, Rotom, the seemingly ""alien"" Clefairy (with its infant and adult forms), ALL of the fossil Pokémon (Kabuto, Omanyte, Aerodactyl, Anorith, Lileep, Cranidos, Shieldon, Tirtouga, Archen, and all their respective evolutions), and most specifically the Starter Pokémon. Also, what is their purpose? All of the Legendaries are given special talents, or lifelong duties, but what about these rare Pokémon?? Relentlessly have I looked for posts that may answer my question, and have found little to none that can completely answer it. So fellow question askers and theorists, any thoughts??

In Regards to the M01 DNA Experiments:

___________________________________________________________

Mew was the first. The creature was originally thought to be a local folk legend or myth of natives in the Amazon Basin. However, the discovery of remains in the nation of Guyana sent shock waves through the scientific community. Primarily, the odd DNA of the animal seemed to show an abnormal ability for adaption and evasion. 

It would be many years before a live specimen was seen. The creature had strange abilities that allowed it to modify its surroundings, defy gravity, become invisible, and control nature. Continued observations of the creature and research on the DNA of the original remains showed that this creature was not associated with any other life forms on Earth. This Mew, as the natives called it, was an enigma that begged to be investigated. 

Jump ahead two decades. Years of research on the DNA allowed for the manipulation of pre-existing animal life. Early experiments were horrible failures, creating amorphous blobs of malleable flesh.  These mistakes were code-named “Dittos” for their constant desire to morph into objects around them. Later experiments were of greater value. Mundane animals like birds and lab rats were injected with modified viruses containing the M01 DNA, to great effect. 

During this process, my team has shown an adept ability to develop hilarious and sometimes idiotic code names for the results of our research. A rat, named Jimmy by myself, was the first rat injected with the M01 DNA. After three days, during which time the creature’s flesh broke out it boils and scabs, Jimmy morphed into something a colleague of mine, we’ll call her Jill, called a Rattata. Afterwards, all rat based test subjects became known under the codename, “Rattata.”

Further research has also allowed us to create some unexpected results. A mistake involving a turtle triggered a specimen codenamed “Squirtle.”  The subject was left in its terrarium with water in it. A radiation leak in the lab reacted with the test subject during its morph. The end result was the ability for the creature to manipulate water with what we can only deduce is its mind, a type of hyrdo-kinesis if you will.

Since this incident, we have exposed multiple specimens to the same radiation and other elements, such as heat. This has resulted in specimens, codenamed “Charmander” and “Bulbasaur,” both reptiles. Charmander was a lizard exposed to intense heat, resulting in the ability to manipulate heat energy, i.e. fire. Bulbasaur was a toad that was exposed to a very invasive form of plant life recently discovered in the Amazon Basin, which to this point seemed to kill all other animals it infected. The result in the experiment was a sort of symbiotic relationship with the plant, allowing the specimen the ability to grow and control vine-like appendages and other plant-like defense and hunting mechanism.  

Obviously, the M01 DNA had a profound effect on the DNA of our specimens. Thus far we have concluded that this DNA, when introduced to a specimen, takes the most advantagous features of the creature and amps them up. In the cases of the radiation exposed specimens, it seems capable of even allowing them to control their environments to an extent. This would give them unprecedented survivability in the wild and a clear advantage over non-M01 modified species. 

I can only imagine how Mew utilizes this DNA. From the reports, it seems as though this creature has evolved into an unparalleled animal. One can only wonder where something like this Mew might have originated from.

And yet, no sooner does he complete his journey of one region and compete in its Pokémon League, than an entirely new region with a whole new League and several hundred more Pokémon opens up.

Of course, for us in the ""real world"" (""transcendent beings"" from Ash's perspective) it is clear what's going on: the show continues as long as it is profitable, it is profitable as long as it is entertaining, and it is entertaining as long as Ash continues to search for new Pokémon.

But consider how it must appear to him. He carries on, oblivious to the repetitiveness of his existence, and seemingly learning nothing from the whole experience. What will it take for him to realize that he is chasing a rainbow, a goal which is perpetually receding and which will forever remain just out of reach?

The Buddha says:

&gt; Suffering knows no end; unendingly the wheel turns and turns... All are lined with illusion... All desires do not last. So I do not cling. One who casts off desires, meditates well, attains the wonderful Dharma, and definitely cuts off ""samsaric existence"" can today gain Nirvana. I pass over to the other shore of ""samsaric existence"" and stand above all sorrows. Thus I harvest this superb Bliss.

&gt; ...A conjuror... conjures up all kinds of garlands, body adornments, castle-towns, villages, mountains, forests, trees, springs, ponds, rivers and wells. Of the onlookers, the little children who have not much intellect will think that all these are real, but those of intelligence will know that all is sheer untrue illusory allure, which cheats a person’s eyes.

When Ash finally sees himself for what he is—an avatar in a mere idle fantasy—and resolves, *I will play this game no longer*: only then will he attain Enlightenment. That day, when Pokémon is no longer profitable, will be the day the franchise concludes. With the ultimate understanding of the true nature of the world, the cycle of suffering will at last come to an end.

You guys are all super cool and every day I am seriously impressed by the quality and discussion on this subreddit. The imagination (and weirdness) in every homegrown conspiracy never fails to impress me. 

Thanks for making this a top-notch subreddit. [In so little time, too.](http://redditlist.com/stats/pokemonconspiracies) 

________

Since there have been a lot of new subscribers and a surge in new posts, I'm also posting a proto-FAQ. Please discuss and criticize this, we want to make this community the best for the most people possible. 
_________________

**Proto-FAQ**

    So what do you guys do here?
    
We post our or other people's theories on aspects of the pokemon world. Really cool conspiracies here include Oddish being an [integral part](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/s5hmd/bulbasauroddish_symbiosis/) of the Bulbasaur family or Red's [self-imposed exile](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/s524f/true_reason_red_is_on_mtsilver/). 
    
    Not everything on here is a conspiracy!
    
    
Yes, sometimes people post interesting things they noticed in the pokemon world or fourth wall references. They can make for interesting discussion, and people have developed these into actual conspiracies. If you think it's very irrelevant, message the mods. 
    
    Is creepypasta accepted?

As long as it's pokemon-related, yes. 
    
    Are memes allowed?

As long as they're related to a pokemon conspiracy, yes. However, self-posts are preferred and memes can be removed at the discretion of the moderators.
    
    This is a repost!

Reposts or rehashes of an idea are becoming more frequent. As long as it's spawning discussion or people think it's a cool conspiracy, it's worthwhile. New people are joining every day. That said, image posts or blogspam reposts will be removed- selfposts can at least go into detail or add something new. 
    
    Why did my post get removed or downvoted?
    
It was likely an image repost or a shameless karma grab. Refer to top posts, anything on there people are probably sick of discussing. [This image](http://nintendoland.com/upload/Conspracy.png) also contains the most popular conspiracies.
    
    Why did my comment get removed?
    
Simply stating ""this is not a conspiracy"" is not a useful comment. Also, racism, sexism and ad-hominem attacks are not tolerated. 
    
    How do I get flair?
    
You can edit your flair in the right sidebar. Consistent contributors will sometimes get custom flair.
    
    What's your favorite pokemon?

Scyther.

But what are these chemicals which can breathe life into a plastic bag of waste? Simple. A Grimer.

We first meet a Trubbish on the routes leading out of Nimbasa. But, there are no Grimer here. However, there are some in Castelia, where, as it is such a large city, likely has much trash. I propose the theory, Trubbish form when a Grimer enters a Trash Bag and either becomes stuck or chooses to stay in the bag, eventually melding to it. After said creation, the Trubbish migrate north, away from the Sewer and Desert that now pose a threat in the form of Sandiles and Rattata, which can easily rupture the plastic shell. 

An alternate theory is that Nimbasa does in fact have Grimer, but they follow the same process above since there is no water around, from which Grimer prefer to inhabit. Instead of trekking the even drier desert, they take the form of a trash bag to keep in moisture, and therefor, stay in the form. This also explains how other areas have Trubbish and Garbodor, since Grimer likely has no other alternative.

But what of Garbodor and Muk? Surely, these to evolutions impede the theory. But that is where you are wrong. You see, when Grimer evolves, he grows. And when trash bags are filled, they stretch or Rupture. Therefore, to hold itself inside, Muk stretches the bag in order to maintain it's form. I support this by using the fact that Garbodor evolves 2 levels earlier than Muk, due to the constraint of the bag keeping Grimer more moist and compact.

World Conflict that began previous to Gen.I
The various national governments are influenced/corrupted by the Pokemon League and corporations (Silph Co, etc)
The world was actually created by Arceus

What are the implications on the Pokemon world? 

Here is my example:
It is accepted both by science and pokereligion that Arceus created the world in which everyone lives. The implication of intelligent design may be that Pokemon are sentient creatures, but most have not developed the ability to communicate through language. If Pokemon are sentient, then there must be a strain in terms of equal rights of Pokemon and, as we have seen, the development of counter cultures to the capturing, training, and battling of pokemon.

In the universe of the Pokemon games, people describe certain Pokemon as looking like Pokeballs - Voltorb, Amoongus, etc. Why would that be? Voltorb could well be a Pokeball come to life, but it seems unlikely that any sort of experiment gone wrong, no matter how catastrophically so, would have turned a small, non-living capsule into a living, Grass-type Pokemon. We see an issue here. Let me offer my reasoning.

It's clear that the people of the Pokemon world know very little about where they live. New regions are constantly being discovered, populated with new Pokemon, and people in-game seem genuinely surprised about this. Not only that, but new breeds of Pokemon are being found to exist in regions where they were previously unknown. It almost seems as if people in this world are rediscovering a great deal of information that has been lost to them about the natural world and their surroundings. My theory is this: The Amoongus and Voltorb family predate Pokeballs, even Aprikorns, by a great number of years. The people of the Pokemon world saw this same pattern, a sphere that was half red and half white, and adopted the motif throughout their culture. Unown fit into this theory - they might not be the same color scheme, but their perfectly round eyes with the black dot must have hearkened to these ancient peoples. As the people's technological prowess grew, they modeled their devices for capturing Pokemon after this motif they saw so oft repeated in the natural world. Then some age of ignorance, much like our worlds Dark Ages, occurred. Most knowledge was lost, and eventually people began to believe these Pokemon spawned from Pokeballs, not the other way around. In my mind this works much like patterns we might see in nature. We might believe we created mathematics, but looking at fractals as they exist in snowflakes and the golden ratio in the shell of a nautilus, nature has been modelling mathematical concepts from the get-go.

tl:dr, Pokeballs are based off of Pokeball-patterned/shaped Pokemon, not the other way around, but the modern Pokemon world is ignorant of this fact.

When this was discovered, ice cream was being made less and less, but the Vanillite escaped to frozen areas to be free. They bred to make an entire population, and when they saw new forms of ice cream like double scoops and banana splits, they evolved.

As Oddish was one of the first Pokemon to originate due to the contamination of the plants in Kanto, it was most likely one of the first Pokemon to ever be eaten. My theory is that a frog-like reptile, resembling the body of a Bulbasuar became the natural predator of the Oddish and more and more Oddish began to be eaten, as they would have provided more energy than the non-moving plants. Then,  as the chemicals began to permeate the water supply and possibly even the air, they slowly caused a mutation in the digestion fluids of the frog-creature. The mixture of chemicals that came from the mutated Oddish and the mutated digestion fluids caused the Oddish to essentially seed the stomach of the toad, leeching onto spine and rib-cages for support, of the toad and grow out of its back, fighting with all it's might to find sunlight, in an extremely painful manner for the frog. As the Oddish's roots were infused into the digestive track and spine of the frog, the two began to share the products of their respective feeding styles: photosynthesis and common-digestion.

As the new species of frog, Bulbasuar, gathers more and more energy from the sun and it's own meals, which it now kills easily with the help of the Oddish's vines and its own physical features, the energy build up causes the Oddish plant in it's body to bud into a mutated version of Gloom (the mutation coming from the mutated digestion fluids). The budding in turn causes the frog's body to rapidly adapt to the new shape, creating Ivysaur.  Similarly, when the plant reaches it's full blossom, what would be Vileplume in the original Oddish growth cycle, it again changes the shape of the frog, making it bigger, to adapt to the larger weight, but providing it with more energy.

As time went on, more and more of the infected frogs began to show up in the Kanto region, and when they began to mate, some were born with germinated Oddish plants already in their stomachs, creating the Pokemon breed Bulbasaur.

I am no biologist, so if there is anything fundamentally wrong with this let me know, but this is just the plausible scenario that came to me.

However, it doesn't quite mesh with the story. I, the hero of Hoenn, who saved the world from clashing legendaries, and have now claimed the Championship of Hoenn, just got my ass handed to me by some Bug Catcher (who has Lv. 70 Pokemon)? Moreover, that there's a huge park full of people tougher than the ruler of Hoenn? That doesn't seem quite realistic.

My idea is that the Battle Frontier's facilities use a complex computer system, almost like the Matrix, where you and your opponent's Pokemon are copied into a simulation environment (similarly to the way Pokemon are stored in a computer, only the key change is that your opponent's Pokemon are given a handicap.) You and your opponent can then command your Pokemon (whether through a microphone or actually entering the virtual stadium is open to speculation).


Evidence to support:

-Everyone there has Pokemon as powerful as the Champion. This doesn't mesh. The computer simulation would be able to control the levels of the Pokemon, ensuring a fair battle based only on abilities, held item selection, moveset, and Trainer orders.

-Your Pokemon are still at full health after the battle*; an IRL battle would cause injuries, whereas these simulated battles don't actually harm the Pokemon.

-As we know, the Pokemon world has a lot of amazing stuff computers can do with Pokemon. They're already stored in virtual boxes, putting two in a stadium doesn't seem like much of a stretch.

-No items can be used. Probably a feature intended to make battles more even. Plus, you can't use an item on a Pokemon in the computer.

-The Battle Factory has Pokemon for rental that are rare, or legendary (Ex. Suicune, Raikou, Latias). It seems unlikely that the park would send people all over the world to catch these legendaries, only to rent them out like party ponies. I think a better explanation would be that this would be part of the attraction, to be able to use legendary Pokemon.

Thoughts? I can also post my theory on Pokemon League politics later.

Depending if you consider the anime and game canon close enough to make a connection the [this guy](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Westwood_V) writes all the Pokedex data.

Even if you don't beleive that this particular person wrote all the pokedex entries, someone had to. Unless you believe the pokedex makes the entry up itself. My personal theory is that pokedex's are very much like mobile phones and can connect to the poke-worlds equivalent of 3G/4G wifi to download data about a particular species. They are programmed not to download the text entries however until you connect a pokeball containing the species to the pokedex. (Very much in this same way are pokeballs transferred to the Storage System servers when you have 6 on hand)

Anyways back to the point I was trying to make in the first place. Some Pokedex entries are stories or myths that are traditional to the poke-world. (Sort of a parallel to the Aesop's fables in our own world) This would would explain entries with contradictions or plot loopholes, such as Cubone's or Yamask's.

Pokedex entries for Cubone often state that it wears the skull of its dead mother, however I've breed a ton of Cubone and my Marowak has never died. If this was the case for every single Cubone then this pokemon could not exist. Also the Pokedex never mentions Team Rocket killing its mother, just the fact that its mother is dead. This strongly implies that the incident in Lavender Town was either coincidence or the old fable gave the Rockets the idea to poach the tower's Marowak for the skull in the first place.

Another point to consider is that the anime never mentions Cubone's skull coming from its mother. Also when I hatch Yamask egg's do people die? I don't think so. If so I would be a poke-genocidist.

This could potentially explain the fact that pokemon implied to be unique are not actually unique but in fact are only unique in their paticular legend. This however is a whole nother can of weedles and this post is long winded as it is.

Part II: [A breeding theory] (http://redd.it/15shwg)

Part III: [Cries] (http://redd.it/1610g7)

I apologize, guys.  More facets to the theory keep popping into my head, and if I just stuck them in the original, no one would read them.  Anyways, on to the theory.  Why does trading involve such a big kerfuffle?  Why can't trainers just swap and be done with it?  My theory is that there's a special type of energy field around the Pokeball that imprints itself to the original catcher; this same field is what keeps trainers from being able to steal each other's Pokemon.  The trading machine temporarily wipes this field in order for another trainer to imprint themselves onto the Pokeball.  However, an unintended consequence of this process is that the transformative energy of the Pokemon is supercharged; in fact it causes some to evolve then and there (Alakazam, Gengar, Gigalith, etc.).  Others will evolve, but only with a certain item.  The supercharged inner Ditto basically absorbs this item and incorporates it into the evolution (Metal Coat making Scizor, Deepseatooth making Huntail).  The rest of them gain experience more quickly, and thus reach their evolutions faster.  On the flipside of this is the Everstone, which keeps Pokemon from evolving.  Why would it do this?  Because the Everstone is basically like a radiation sponge.  For whatever reason, the Everstone siphons off excess evolutionary energy from the Pokemon.  It eventually becomes unable to absorb further, and once it is filled, it transforms itself, based on what kind of energy it mainly absorbed, and actually becomes able to induce evolution upon contact with certain Pokemon.  That's right:  The Fire Stones, Leaf Stones, Dawn Stones--all of them were originally Everstones.

1350670697.0,40,self.pokemonconspiracies,11rcl1,"A theory on Professor Oak's previous allegations, Ash's father, Team Rocket, and Pokemon-Human fusion. (A response)",54,14,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/11rcl1/a_theory_on_professor_oaks_previous_allegations/,"**This is in response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wa5ff/shocking_revelation_about_ashs_father/) post about Ash's father and Prof. Oak.**

It's quite possible, that Prof. Oak used to work for Team Rocket. Hear me out, Prof. Oak worked for TR back in his younger days when he first started designing the Pokedex.

He was doing experiments on Pokemon trying to change them, this is when Ash's father was transformed into Pikachu, destroying Team Rocket's lab. Prof. Oak fled Team Rocket, ashamed and afraid of what Giovanni would do to him when he finally got his hands on him for destroying a multimillion dollar lab. He flees to Pallet town and hides the Pikachu, knowing that he will meet a trainer in the future that uses a Pikachu as his starter Pokemon. And keeps the accident a secret from Delia, saying that he wasn't cleared for top secret research that her husband (Ash's father) was cleared for, that required them to have no outside contact.

Prof. Oaks research wasn't totally destroyed in the explosion at the lab, in fact most of it was intact, the hardware was what was destroyed. Giovanni hires scientists (The very same ones that create Mewtwo later on) to work on and improve Oak's work. Meowth is created years later, infusing one of Giovanni's lower ranking grunts with a Pokemon (So as not to risk a high ranking officer to death) and sending him with two other grunts to see how well the process stays together. He learns the success of the project with Meowth, but he sees that Jessie, James, and Meowth are too incompetent to do any of his actual dirty work. So he sets the scientists on a path to create a stronger Pokemon, one that has nearly unlimited powers, for his highest ranked trainer to fuse with. They create Mewtwo, and fuse him with his trainer. Slowly they begin treating him less like an equal and more like a Pokemon slave. Training him harder, being more brutal, overworking him. Eventually he snaps, and destroys the lab, and everyone in it. About this time Giovanni arrives to see their work. And offers Mewtwo an equal partnership. This leads into the first Pokemon Movie.

Oak hears about the Meowth about the time Ash runs into his lab, and decides it's time for Ash to begin his training to stand up to them. As Oak is too old to be fighting anymore, he gives Ash the Pikachu that should never have been, and sends him on a journey with it. Ash and the Pikachu run into Team Rocket many times, and Pikachu (Ash's father, being a high-ranking scientist for Team Rocket previously) see's the low ranking grunts, and is immediately disgruntled, and angry. He attacks them with more vigor than anyone else because he is used to being cruel to the lower level grunts.

Pikachu speaks to Mewtwo, and is explaining the miseries, and problems being a Pokeman (get it? Play on words...Poke-Human) and the responsibilities it entails. Mewtwo ignores this and continues the battle against Ash and friends. Only after Ash is ""killed"" does he see that Pokemon truely have unknown powers. This gives him the perspective he needs to stop fighting against Pokemon, and to leave them in peace.

I know not all of this fits together perfectly, I'm writing kind of rushed right now. I'll edit as I see fit, but generally I feel this is a pretty good conspiracy on the Pikachu/Mewtwo/Pokemon-Human fusion theory. Also, this is my first thought out and written theory, so if you do downvote this, please give me some feedback, it would be much appreciated.

TL;DR 

* Oak worked for Team Rocket

* Ash's Father had his soul fused with a Pikachu during the accident in Team Rocket's lab (Ash's Pikachu)

* Giovanni has scientists continue Oak's failed research

* Team Rocket creates a Meowth fused with a lower level grunt

* Giovanni sets upon Mewtwo project to fuse his best trainer with

Several redditors pointed out the excess of litter that would be caused by broken PokeBalls. That's rather at odds with the rather Eco- friendly nature of society in Pokemon, especially Hoenn and Johto. 

So here's a theory: PokeBalls are made of a biodegradable plastic. When tossed out, or broken, they degrade naturally and harmlessly. 

I'm sure some people imagined PokeBalls would be made out of metal, but I found a strange enough counter argument to that: Voltorb. This Pokemon is accepted as a PokeBall given life. Unlike its fellow mechanical electric brethren Magnemite it doesn't have a secondary Steel typing. Sure, it's a bit of a stretch but it could work.

We know that Kabutops are extinct, as is the use of blade weapons. And we also know that a relatively new Pokemon has popped up: Rhyperior. Rhyperior is described as filling the holes in its hands with rocks and boulders and then firing them like bullets (source: Bulbapedia). *It could be said that Rhyperior is an old species that was living in Sinnoh for many years, but I choose to believe that it is new; every Pokemon game happens chronologically after the previous game.

I am proud to present the first (of hopefully many) art contest! Now that this subreddit has become fairly active, let's go beyond words in our conspiracy theories! Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to start drawing.

**Contest: Illustrate one pokemon conspiracy that has been presented on this subreddit.**

_______________________________

**Rules and FAQs**

1. *How does this work?* It's simple! In case you're new here, people submit their own theories about the pokemon universe and then discuss their feasibility. [Here's a good example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/s1oa3/plusle_and_minun_are_failed_pichus/) We talk about established theories too, but that's not the subject of this art contest.

2. *So which conspiracies should I illustrate?* Any is fine! It has to be a conspiracy on this subreddit (a self-post), have received at least 5 upvotes and not be illustrated elsewhere. (That is, drawing Gengar as Clefairy's shadow is not a valid submission. And it's on our header, silly!) 

3. *Is there a preferred type of submission?* Nope! It can be an cross-section study, a comic, rough sketches, concept art, 3D, minecraft, whatever's you're fancy! Just be sure to upload it to imgur in .jpeg or .png format **and post it in the comments section below with a brief description of the conspiracy theory.**

4. *Can I submit my own illustrated theory?* **Yes**, but you'll have to submit it as a self-post and receive at least 5 upvotes. This is in fact encouraged! 

5. *When does it have to be done by?* **Submissions are due May 7th, 2012.** That gives you three weeks, we're not expecting masterpieces!

6. *This sounds like a lot of work.* It is! That's a good point...

________________________________

Submissions will close May 7th, 2012, 9:00 PM EST (we won't be finnicky about that). The mods will look at all the submissions and choose the top 3. We'll then have the community vote on them and the winner will receive

* **Three months of reddit gold or $10 to their Steam Wallet**
* **Their submission on the sidebar of this subreddit for a month**
* **Their choice of flair**
 
***Good luck everyone, may the best brush win!***

As I was obsessively breeding every Pokemon in Black in order to have one of every species, because I'm that kind of person, I thought about the breeding process.  If my theory about Dittos is true, then how about this for the breeding process:  Pokemon have no reproductive organs, as it were.  Due to their semi-amorphous state, they simply produce the eggs, growing them in their core.  The ""birthing"" process simply happens when the eggs slide out of the body.  They wouldn't even neccessarily have to have anything approaching sex, or even a melding of bodies; just as Ditto can transform just by looking at something, so too can the genetic information be passed between two Pokemon without any organic component required.  As for why some are male and some are female, perhaps the female are still more Ditto-like, where as the males have more information encoded, as it were.  This is why the Day-Care man never sees the egg process; he's not an idiot.   He knows how biology works, and that's precisely why he's baffled at the egg's appearance without every seeing any Pokesex happening.

Silver theory/Blue's future afterwards,73,36,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15oihl/my_own_red_on_mt_silver_theoryblues_future/,"Ok, so no one so far has mentioned this, and the recent posts on Red have gotten my brain churning. This is the result.

So we know Red kicks ass. Beats Team Rocket for good, catches legendary Pokemon, becomes Champion, etc. But that isn't why he's on Mt. Silver. The last Champion he faced, and beat, was Blue. Blue, still broken by the loss of his Raticate on the S.S. Anne (another theory), and his constant losing to Red, finally snaps after his loss in the championship. He runs off, if I remember correctly, and we don't see him again (unless we want to beat him multiple times to be the Champion multiple times). 

My theory is that Blue ran off to get weapons/guns. Something hidden from the Kanto region during the Pokemon War. These would be the only things that could cause Red to lose, since he is basically a legend in terms of Pokemon. Blue became obsessed with trying to find Red, and the constant feeling of loss in his life. Red, seeing this in time, tries to run. However, Blue chases him, and only at Mt. Silver do the two finally reach an end. They have one last battle, and Blue loses yet again. In his anger, Blue shoots Red, leaving his body, and ghost, on the summit, and going back to be the Gym Leader in Viridian.

My thoughts on why Blue is the Gym Leader is because if you can beat him, then you might stand a chance with the ghost of Red, still on the summit, still waiting for that Trainer who can beat him, the greatest Trainer. This also makes sense of why Red doesn't speak: Not because ghosts can't speak, but because he understands that you, the Trainer facing him, could equal him as the greatest in the world, by beating his old rival.

The advantage of having a diverse team seems so clear, and yet, every high-ranking trainer but the player character and the rival (and their cross-franchise counterparts) has only a few different types. Why is team diversity so rare then? And what makes the player and friends special?

Some possible reasons:

* I'm wrong about the strategy, and it actually *is* most advantageous to have a single-type roster, even in the games. (If so, this is news to me.)
* Pokémon battling requires a certain kind of elemental ""mana"" that can be used only by Pokémon of the same type, like in the Trading Card Game. Then, a monotype team can more effectively share mana and perform more powerful attacks. (However, I'm not aware of any canonical evidence to suggest that anything like this is happening.) Why should Ash/Gary/Red/etc. be able to maintain diverse mana while the professionals can't?
* Pokémon of a certain type have a particular ""personality"" associated with them, so that only trainers who share that personality can hope to get along with them. For example, Fire Pokémon might be aggressive and impulsive; Poison might be sly and underhanded... But can we really find distinct personalities for all 17 types? And furthermore, why should personalities divide so strictly along type lines? (How are Scyther and Metapod at all alike?) What does this say about Ash/Gary/Red/etc.'s personality, then?

Now, I understand in the case of Fighting and Psychic types, that since humans themselves also have those abilities, they'll be better at training Pokémon of the same type (see for example the two gyms in Saffron City). I don't know why this would be true for other types, though.

But in-game, there aren't very many regulations about battling and item use. Trainers will fight you in undergrounds, on ships, and casinos. You can whip out a Charizard in the middle of a store and use a Super Potion. Sure, you can 'poke-proof' buildings to a certain degree, but imagine not when trainers start using snorlax (1000 pounds, 400 kilos) and wailords (47 feet, 14 meters).

So I think **pokeballs**, because they can minimize pokemon or transform them into data, can also shrink a pokemon to a certain degree. So when trainers are about to fight, they compare the size of their pokemon and decide on a scale, say 1:15 if they are really big pokemon, 1:2 if they are using small pokemon like rattatas. 

You could have little miniature pokemon battles without destroying cities using hyperbeam. And the fights would stay fair.

I have reason to believe that it was not against any of the 5 main regions, but was actually a war against the Orre region. 

The Orre region is featured in both Pokemon Colosseum and its sequel, Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness. It's mostly a desolate wasteland surrounded by desert that doesn't even have any wild Pokemon(They have a few, but those don't appear til later in the first game). It seems reasonable that a war would be declared on them. In the first game, most of the shadow Pokemon are from Johto, even the legendary beasts, and a few from Hoenn IIRC. Then in the second game, Cipher steals a whole ship Hoenn Pokemon. This would raise tensions between the regions. Since Johto is connected with Kanto, it also becomes Kanto's problem. Since the Orre region is to the left of Johto and Kanto, they can attack by land, air, and sea. From looking at a [Pokearth](http://i32.tinypic.com/2hea6n5.png) map, you can see that Orre(the region at the top left) is directly above Hoenn. In a comment on my Johto or Hoenn theory, 88MilesPrower brought up an excellent point. Because Hoenn is presumably near the equator, hence it's tropical climate, the gravity is weaker and allows them to launch rockets with ease, which may also be the reason they are the only region with a space center. Hoenn has a direct path to launch missiles right at Orre. 

Now the problem with this theory combined with mine is that the war is still going on, but Gale of Darkness takes place a few years after Colosseum. And at the beginning of Colosseum, there is already no wild Pokemon present. So this theory can only work, if the war already happened, and Orre stole Johto, Kanto, and Hoenn Pokemon in retaliation for destroying their region, which makes more sense. Another question that pops in mind is the S.S. Anne. In the theory that the war is still going on, it can be said that it is possibly a battleship in disguise, since when you see it sail off it goes to the left which is the direction that Orre is in(although that is also the only way to get out of Vermillion's port). This is with the war already happened theory. In 3rd gen, which takes place the same time 1st gen does, we see that Hoenn and Kanto were on good terms. They shared Pokeball designs, and even established a link in FR/LG so that Kanto and Hoenn trainers can trade and battle. So what if the S.S. Anne is actually that luxury cruise liner that has the Hoenn Pokemon in side that is stolen by shadow Lugia in the beginning of Gale of Darkness? It is possible that people on S.S. Anne were either released, or held hostage by Cipher. 

TL;DR Orre got pwned by Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn. Then they got butthurt and decided to steal their Pokemon.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_vp9gt,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vp9gt/oh_orre_how_you_amuse_me/,

But this theory deals with the possibility that Giovanni might of actually had good intentions in R/B/G/Y/FR/LG, which can also tie into the Kanto War theory. In [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/siv71/thoughts_on_the_kanto_war_a_means_for_victory/) theory, chemical warfare is said to be the reason for the abundance of poison Pokemon in the Kanto region and the lack thereof in other regions. In order to combat this threat, they decided to create the ultimate psychic Pokemon Mewtwo, seeing how psychic triumphs over poison. However, the work involved would not be cheap and the government would be most likely investing all their money into the war effort. So private funding would be the only possible way for the project to be completed. Giovanni ends up funding the research and the creation of Mewtwo, and even trains it to control its powerful psychic abilities. But as we all know Mewtwo escaped from the lab.

Giovanni knew firsthand the devastating power that Mewtwo possessed. He felt guilty, as he was partly responsible for the creation of the monster that had just been unleashed on the already suffering Kanto region. Giovanni makes the decision to stop Mewtwo and creates Team Rocket to help him do so. Team Rocket's actions reflect a plan or desire to stop Mewtwo. They are searching for fossils in Mt. Moon in hopes that the ancient Pokemon that would be revived was stronger than Mewtwo, or would be able to subdue it for long enough. The silph scope allows the user to see ghosts, and more importantly, ghost Pokemon. Giovanni steals this item to attempt to find a strong ghost Pokemon, because ghost type triumphs over psychic type. He attempts to steal the master ball because it can catch any Pokemon without fail. He hopes to stop Mewtwo by catching it, and the master ball was the best chance he had at doing so. Finally, he is a gym leader in hopes to attract strong trainers, as most gyms do. He plans for these exceptionally strong trainers to assist him in defeating Mewtwo. But like all his other plans, Red stops this one as well. Giovanni is never able to show his good intentions because Red stops him before he ever has the chance. Red stopped Team Rocket from getting the fossils, he took the silph scope from Giovanni, prevented Giovanni from getting the master ball and receives it instead, and finally defeats all the trainers in his gym as well as Giovanni. Giovanni, realizing how all his plans failed, how truly powerless he is, and how capable Red is, relinquishes the responsibility of stopping Mewtwo to Red who also possess the master ball. 

But what about all the bad things that Team Rocket has done? It is true that Team Rocket has a reputation of being evil, but that can also be explained. Giovanni knew that he would not be able to stop Mewtwo on his own, so he formed Team Rocket for extra manpower. And just as he formed Team Rocket for extra manpower, they steal Pokemon for extra pokemonpower to help stop Mewtwo. Like most bosses of organizations, Giovanni did not reveal his true intentions to his subordinates. This caused them to get the misconception that they were actually trying to take over the world by obtaining all this power. Thinking like this also causes them to act on their own accord, such as their plan to take the Johto region 3 years later, and how that one grunt in G/S/C/HG/SS who stole the generator IIRC from the power plant in Kanto that didn't know that Team Rocket had disbanded again. 

TL;DR Giovanni was actually trying to stop Mewtwo instead of trying to take over the world.

D:,41,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/qtqtw/pokéwar_d/,"There’s a theory floating around the interwebs that paints a dark, horrific history of the Pokémon world, or at least Red/Blue’s Kanto region. Many players have noted that in Pokémon Red/Blue, there is a large absence of middle aged men in the game world. Think about the last time you played Pokémon. An abnormally large amount of Pokémon trainers chillin’ in the wild were little kids. Think about it. Why were there so many damn toddlers roaming the wilds unattended? There were plenty of elderly men and women in the world (Professor Oak), and many middle aged women (the player’s mom, the nurses), but a lack of middle aged men. What about the player’s father, or your rival’s father? While most people wouldn’t worry about the absence of middle aged dudes, some Pokémon fans have rationalized this through the creation of yet another insane theory.

The electric-type gym leader, Lt. Surge mentions being a survivor of some sort of brutal war that almost took his life (he claims that his Pokémon saved his life). Other trainers in the gym were once soldiers in some sort of army, which presumably fought in a war. A war where Pokémon were used as weapons. Let that sink in for a moment, as you try to imagine the horror of hundreds of terrified soldiers storming beaches being held by goddamn Charizards. Some fans believe this war was the cause of the lack of adult men, claiming that all of them had been killed in the war. Essentially, some people are speculating that this war caused a ‘generation kill’, and that the young children of the Kanto region are the first generation to find peace. This also explains why the player’s father is absent (hint, he died), and why the rival character has no parents (hint, they died). While a lot of this theory involves speculation and imagination, the horrifying idea of a human-Pokémon war that wiped out an entire generation is pretty damn sweet.

1363322470.0,36,self.pokemonconspiracies,1ac0f4,The Truth About the Black Tower and White Treehollow?,39,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1ac0f4/the_truth_about_the_black_tower_and_white/,"I've recently put up a sort of discovery on [/r/EVtraining](http://www.reddit.com/r/EVtraining/comments/19w9tp/did_you_know_that_specific_black_tower_and_white/) which basically stated that:

1. Different trainer classes utilized certain EV-giving pokemon
2. The Tower and Treehollow held specific trainer classes; Tower held the classes which gave S. Attack, S. Defense, and Speed, while Treehollow had the HP, Attack, and Defense trainer classes.

If there is a split in trainer classes between the two areas, could the types of trainers within each area share characteristics? I think so. Let's have a look:

*****

**White Treehollow:** *Baker, PokeFan M, PokeFan F, Battle Girl, Black Belt, Police, Roughneck, Hiker, Janitor, Worker, Miner*

These are the characters which utilized Attack, Defense, and HP EV pokemon. Generally speaking, these stats are used to describe physical attributes. Attack and Defense, for example, can describe how well a pokemon and respective trainer can push through or withstand an obstacle, respectively. HP, likewise, describes fatty pokemon and all-around longevity.

Going down into uncharted areas, one would assume to find Hikers scouting the area. Modern day adventurers are also around whether they are capable (Battle Girls and Black Belts) or probably not (PokeFans). A good chuck of the trainers, however, deal with blue collar occupations: Janitors, Miners, Bakers, and Workers. Most interesting of all is the odd inclusion of the Police and Roughneck trainer classes which have a dynamic of police and prisoner.

*****

**Black Tower:** *Psychic M, Psychic F, Scientist M, Scientist F, Doctor, School Kid M, School Kid F, Waiter, Waitress, Backpacker M, Backpacker F, Gentleman, Socialite, Lady, Lass, Rich Boy, Youngster*

These trainer classes, on the other hand use pokemon which yield Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed EVs. These characteristics are generally used to describe the mind and its capabilities. Special Attack, for example, describes mental prowess or knowledge and Special Defense can determine mental stability. Speed, while can be taken as an entirely physical skill, can also used to reference the speed at which individuals can come to conclusions or process information, or an individual's IQ.

The classes found in the Tower seem to describe a totally opposite population. Many of the trainers are generally younger (Youngsters, Lasses, Backpackers, and School Kids), richer (Gentlemen and Socialites), and even both (Ladies and Rich Boys). Psychics, Scientists, and Doctors generally describe more mental-labor-intensive work. Actually, probably the only physical labor occupation within the tower would be done by the Waiters and Waitresses.

*****

What does this all mean then? I propose that **the Tower and Treehollow are two approaches to apocalypse safe zones.** 

I'll approach the topic by utilizing the re-occurring theme of truth and ideals in the BW series. [It's known that Reshiram, and so the White game line, represents truths while Zekrom, Black game line, represents ideals](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Heroes_of_Truth_and_Ideals).

The Treehollow, appearing in White 2, could be said to describe a safe zone and the reality of the people with the capabilities of survival. The people would generally be physically capable of working in a tough environment, whether actually working (Attack and Defense) or withstanding the environment (HP). People are expected to work for their food (Bakers). In all reality, there would be some sort of punishment system (Police and Roughnecks).

On the flipside, the Tower from the Black line would then describe an ideal safe zone situation in which the population is waited on (Waiters and Waitresses) and have access to generally better medical care (Doctors). Children are well off (Lasses, Youngsters, Ladies, and Rich Boys) and educated (School Kids). With respects to education (Special Attack and Speed), the population can be seen as more educated (Doctors and Scientists). There seems to be time for leisure (Special Defense), such as Backpacking and religion (Psychics).

*****

It's also worth to note that the White Treehollow and the Black Tower share certain classes as well.

**Nurses** and **Breeders** seem to further the apocalypse safe zone concept by reinforcing the idea that the people residing in the Treehollow and Tower have general access to licensed health providers (albeit not as good as the Doctors in the Tower for Treehollow people) and pokemon procreation.


**Area Bosses** are also Breeders, Rangers, Ace Trainers, and Veterans. These trainer classes seem to have stronger pokemon than their respective area's trainers. They may have leadership roles within their respective communities. [If a person beats a boss, they seem to take over the defeated boss' position, as seen in Benga's role in both areas.](/spoiler) This could describe a hierarchy system within the community which favours battling capabilities in leaders.

The fact that Team Rocket killed a Marowak (the Lavender Tower ghost) and the Cubones found in the tower seem to back this up.

Yet the Pokedex seems to claim this is the case for *all* Cubones and Marowaks. Is the 'dex insinuating all of this species have lost their mothers? Do they die in childbirth? Does Team Rocket have a worldwide Marowak genocide program? And yet, if one breeds a Marowak/Cubone in captivity, no death happens. A baby Cubone hatches from the egg and both parents remain thankfully alive.

This brings me to my theory: The Pokedex entries about Cubone's dead mother are nothing more than folklore based on misunderstandings of a species' actions.

Now one would wonder why every member of the species is packing a skull helmet and club then. Yet, animals in our own world instinctively gravitate towards using tools as part of their natural defenses. Hermit crabs are not born with their shells, yet they instinctively seek them. Perhaps the Cubone/Marowak species began wielding discarded bones as weapons and armor, and it eventually became instinct. Perhaps skulls and clubs are even gifted to younglings by their parents.

The lonely aspect of Cubone's personality remains unanswered though, but this could also be behavior of the species. Perhaps young Cubone are driven away from their parents at an early age. Marowak are mentioned in the Pokedex as being very savage Pokemon, so perhaps they do not nurture their young for very long. Then as the young Cubone are left to fend for themselves, they too develop a hardened, savage nature, which creates a vicious cycle to pass from one generation to the next.

As for Cubone hatching from eggs already possessing a skull and club...I'll just chock that up to [Gameplay and Story Segregation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation).

I guess most of you know that for a plant to survive it has to make sugar to feed itself, that's called photosynthesis.
6x CO2 + 6x H20 =&gt; C6H1206 + 6x O2
So basically: Carbondioxide + Water + Sunlight + Chlorophyll =&gt; Sugar + Breathable Oxygen

Now we know that for quite some time the sun was darkened by volcanic ash, and during that time Volcarona replaced the sun with it's own fire. 
[(Pokédex: When volcanic ash darkened the atmosphere, it is said that Volcarona’s fire provided a replacement for the sun.)] (/spoiler)

However the light coming from fire doesn't have the same composition as sunbeams, thus plants will not be able to create sugar, and will die. [(Plants need red and blue light, the fire from Volcarona is orange-red and so does not contain blue light.)] (/spoiler)

So how did they survive?


[One of my theories, sadly only works for the 'saurs:
The plant on Bulbasaur's back feeds itself with the blood of its host and substracts the sugar from it, thus not needing conversion.
Bulbasaur still feeds itself on the plant's leaves.] (/spoiler)

But what if we're looking at it wrong?  There are two reasons why I think Sylveon is actually going to be a Dragon type.

1.)  All of the Eeveelutions are based off of types that previously fell under the Special category: Dragon is the only kind that isn't represented.

2.)  So only one Eeveelution was introduced, and in the diagram, he was placed across from Jolteon.  But he's also across from Flareon and Vaporeon.  The only type resistant to all three is Dragon.  But then you'd point out that Grass is also resistant.  Well, opposite symmetrically from Leafeon is Glaceon, who happens to be strong against Dragon types.  Now, this makes  symmetrical pattern of the three on top being resistant, the middle ones (Espeon and Umbreon) being neutral, and then a resistance balancing out a weakness.

Now the last is a stretch, but I don't see Slyveon becoming a Normal type since Eevee is normal and it doesn't look like it can fly, nor does it really look like any other type really.

I'm not that very smart and their may be flaws here.
In Kadabra's Pokemon Firered and Emerald Entry, it states that 'It happened one morning - a boy with extrasensory powers awoke in bed transformed into Kadabra.' Also in Emerald's Entry, it stated that this boy 'was assisting research into extrasensory powers.' In the DS/GBA Titled 'Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team' there lies a friend area called Decrepit Lab. It said that it was an abandoned lab built by humans long ago. There is also an Alakazam that helps the player's team in this game, and the Abra family comes to the Decrepit Lab friend area when recruited into the team. My thoughts? A few years before the events of the game happened, Humans *did* exist in the Pokémon World where the game takes place (In the Sequel, The Player character was a human when in the future, showing Humans can survive there.) and they were doing research on the area, perhaps trying to make Humans as strong as Pokémon. They tested on Psychic Pokémons extrasensory abilities to see if they could use it as well. One they they though they have found a solution to their problem; and tested it on a young boy late at night. It seemed to  work, as the boy became super intelligent and had Psychic Abilities. so in excitement, they all went to bed that night to do it on themselves in the morning. However, the boy soon transformed into a Kadabra overnight, as the Firered and Emerald Pokédex entries state. His new powers overwhelmed him and he destroyed the lab, killing all his fellow, adult scientists. When he regained control, he had amnesia, like the player characters do in the games. He wandered off, soon making friends with his now teammates of Team A.C.T. He later Evolved, as well. He may or may not have recovered from his amnesia yet. Now, there may be SOME flaws or hints I missed, but please note this is my first theory.

Examples include Kris' level 9 Bayleaf in the manga, Blues level 16 Raticate and Ghetsis' level 54 Hydreigon. I have often heard it claimed that this is due to Human intervention, such as Team Rocket's radio-waves that can force evolution. However, I do not think there is any merit to this hypothesis, because there are instances of early evolutions in the wild before Gen 2, such as level 15 Gyarados and level 4 Kakuna and Metapod in Gen 1. My hypothesis is that these evolutions are either:

A) A genetic mutation that occurs in some Pokemon. 

B) A virus that forces evolution.

Personally, I think there is more merit to B, because it is already known that there are viruses such as Pokerus that enhance a Pokemon's abilities. Both hypothesis explain the localised occurrences of early-evolutions, because if it's genetic, the mutation corresponding to early evolution could be spread throughout the gene pool of the Pokemon in the area. Likewise, a virus could also be particular to a certain locale. 

However, there are criticisms that can be made. In the case of A, this does not explain why natural selection has not eliminated all of the Pokemon in the surrounding areas who evolve later. Such a mutation would be extremely beneficial, as a fully evolved Pokemon would be much stronger than it's peers who evolve later. In case B, this does not explain why Pokemon of the same species who are owned by trainers do not catch this virus if the trainer spends enough time there.

Now using the Parallel Universes Theory a.k.a the Multiverse Theory as a backdrop, it is possible for there to be an Earth, where pokemon are real, but what if there is already a pokemon living here, in this universe? That pokemon, would none other than Ditto. According it's pokedex entries, it is able to transform to anything it wants. This includes other animals, inanimate objects, and even humans. What really got me thinking was Gold version's pokedex entry where it says when Ditto sleeps it changes into stone.This entry states that it can become an inanimate object, and we wouldn't know. So does Ditto's other entries, where they all say it can become an exact duplicate of whatever it sees. So this means, that right now, anything in your room, anything in your house could actually be a Ditto in disguise. So what if there are Dittos among us, as other people we meet, animals we see, or even stones, and rocks we pick up and throw? Now though, the pokedex entries state that it can make mistakes if done by memory (mostly the face, if the object has a face), so if anything seems weird about an object, it could possibly be a Ditto. Also according to the Silver and SoulSilver versions it can't hold it's disguise if made to laugh. Still though, because once again Ditto can make a perfect copy of something it sees, that means it could be everywhere and all around us.

We haven't seen two competing teams since Gen 3: Magma and Aqua. I think it would be interesting if GameFreak went back to this in the 2nd 3rd generation (2*3=6).

I think X and Y give a pretty good reason to suspect this, too. Most of us believe that the double helices in the title and the names refer to genetics. We also know that the new region is modeled after Western Europe. Well, Western Europe is known for a lot of things, but some of the more relevant ones for this idea are Science, Democracy/Republicanism, the Renaissance, and Feminism.

My theory is that the two teams in X and Y will be competing like Magma and Aqua. Team X will be a feminist group trying to prove that women are the superior gender through science. Their mission is to rid the world of all human males and all male pokemon, using ditto's to reproduce. Team Y will be an overly masculine group that tries to prove through Neo-Platonic and Renaissance ideals that men are the superior gender.  Their mission is to enslave women and female pokemon--their only use being breeding.

In Pokemon X, the protagonist will be trying to take down Team Y and will use Xernes to prove that femininity is an important part of the world and that women are equal.

In Pokemon Y,  the protagonist will be trying to take down Team X and will use Yvetal to prove that masculinity is an important part of the world and that getting rid of men wrong.

In Pokemon Z, the protagonist will be trying to take down both teams as they try to destroy each other and will use Z-pokemon to prove that the harmony of nature requires cooperation between the genders.

Each lense is specialised to spot out shiny objects from the stone or dirt and to work very well in the dark. It gets heavy  of all the gems inside it as it grows older

Diet: it eats minerals and gems from the cave. It digs these gems out by using its strong claws and sharp teeth to naw away at the rock to obtain its prize.  Surtain types of gems form on its body in different places but others go strait to its stomach and get dissolved by its thick acidic stomach. In desperate times it can eat dirt and rocks. It inhabits abandoned mines and old caves. People claim them to be ghosts of the miners that died in the caves or mines. 

Learn set: It learns but is not limited to these moves:

Leer: sableye gives a malicious grin towards the enemy dazing it.

Scratch: it uses it's large claws to scratch the opponent 

Night shade: it creates a ghostly void to scare its opponent

Astonish: it sneakes behind other Pokemon and frightens them

Fury swipe: the sableeye angrily uses it's claws to slash at its opponent

Fake out: the sableye astonishes the enemy Pokemon and makes them flinch

Shadow sneak: the sableye shrouds itself in ghostly energy and quickly appeared infront of its target and hits them.

Knock off: sableye hits the opponent knocking away there whatever the target holds.

Shadow claw: sableye surrounds its claws with ghostly energy (a form of aurora) and slashes at its opponent.

Power gem: the sableye hurls gems ,using psychic power, at the target.

Confuse ray: sableye sends chemicals at the enemy which momentarily gives it amnesia and confuses it.

Foul play: sableye attacks (hits or cuts) the target with as much force as the target would to him.

Zen headbutt: sableye surrounds its head with psychic aurau and slams its head into the target.

Shadow ball: sableye creates a ball of dark energy and fires it at the target.

Mean look: the sableye scares the target and makes it slow down its attack.

(just like liquids can) and gengar represents the solid state of matter. This time the atoms are really close together with stronger bonds. This is why gengar has a solid shape. This doesn't disprove the theory that gengar is clefable's shadow. (yes I believe in that theory and i'm proud) you see, clefable is a strange pokemon. Once clefairy evolves it emmits a strange energy and it releases a doppleganger (clone, who cares how it's spelled) this comes from the energy stored before clefairy evolves, and the energy released when it evolves. It looks like it's shadow because making an identical clone is too much energy and it might take too much time. AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT! (lol) when the shadow is made it goes through a solidification process. Therefore gengar represents solid.

* Growl, Roar → sound
* Scratch → the opponent suffers from cuts
* Hyper Beam → laser damage?
* Comet Punch, Mega Punch, Mega Kick: why are those not fighting moves?

They were *created* for combat, to work in synch with a human commander.  The Pokemon does the fighting, the human does the strategic thinking.  It is a part of who they are.

To deal with the super-powered monsters that got loose in the wild fighting anything they come across, the Japanese government established The Pokemon League and gave research grants to Pokemon researchers.

Young children are given basic training and then venture out to capture the wild Pokemon, so they can be trained and controlled.

The Pokemon League system of turn-based attacks, pre-established names for powers, and championships allows Pokemon to *vent their perpetual need to fight* in a safe, controlled environment.

That is why Pokemon battles are vastly different from cock fights or animal abuse.  A Pokemon under a Trainer lives a happier, safer, healthier life than a wild Pokemon, and still gets to fulfill its purpose.

**The War:**  To support the war theory, it's already well-established that multiple Pokemon are man-made.  In RBY, the majority of male adults are very old.  You have no father, Gary is an orphan.  There are soldiers (Lt. Surge and his crew), and several adults reference a war.

**Normal Animals:** Naturally, regular animals couldn't compete with Pokemon.  Humans couldn't have possibly survived along-side them either.  Pokemon *must* be a recent development.  Normal animals have quickly been overtaken, or... mutated.

**The Process**:  A man-made mutagen.  It warps human and animal DNA, giving them the super-powers the military so desperately wanted.  Every single Pokemon can easily be traced to a normal animal ancestor, or they look disturbingly human.  The rest were made in a lab (Magnetite, Porygon, Electrode).  The animals that haven't been wiped out through natural selection were mutated.  That's why there's *so many Pokemon loose in the wild*.   It also explains why new Pokemon keep showing up as time goes on.  *They're still mutating;* ""evolving,"" so to speak.

**Conclusion:**  Japan has moved on.  The Pokemon League isn't just a sport or hobby; it's a necessary way of life.  A way of correcting and taming the mistakes of the past.  A way of taking man-made monsters and letting them integrate peacefully into society.

Whether or not Pokemon are still used in warfare... well that would certainly be an interesting story.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_vjjs2,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vjjs2/why_pokemon_training_isnt_animal_abuse/,

One day, he went into the basement of the mansion to fix an electrical problem from a recent thunderstorm. As Charon was fixing the problem in the basement, he found a peculiar looking object in an unused washing machine. He messed around with the object which he called a ""motor"". After a couple of days, the motor came to life. Charon realized this certainly was not a motor, but a new species of Pokemon. He called the Pokemon ""Rotom"" and adopted it as his own. 
Several weeks, later, the man's daughter was having a problem with his microwave. She called on his favorite butler to fix it, but he couldn't do the job, so he called on Charon to help him. Charon didn't know how to fix a microwave either, but he knew that Rotom could transform into one, so Rotom transformed into a microwave. 

Before cooking anything, they decided to test the Rotom microwave. The test went horribly wrong. Flames came bursting out of Rotom's mouth and filled the kitchen with smoke. Charon commanded Rotom to stop, but it couldn't. The smoke was starting to spread throughout all parts of the mansion. There was nothing that can be done except to evacuate. Everyone made it out in time... except for the man's daughter. One of the butlers quickly realized this and went in to find her. The butler eventually found her and realized the girl had been poisoned from the smoke. He searched everywhere in the mansion for medicine. He finally found an Antidote in a trash can, but it was already too late. The butler started choking from the fire and eventually died from suffocation. The girl soon perished from carbon monoxide poisoning.
Rotom felt emotionally depressed following the event, so he confined himself in a television set for the rest of his life.
Charon, realizing the trouble and damage he had caused, ran away from the scene and later worked as a scientist for Team Galactic.
The man's wife was distraught at what had happened so decided to take up Pokemon training. She decided to train with the Ghost-type so she can communicate with her deceased daughter. She later became a Gym Leader in Hearthome City.
The man... he was just as distraught as his wife. He built a mansion just exactly like the Old Chateau... but it just didn't feel right. He returned to the Old Chateau and retrieved a statue from the entrance hall and the bodies of his daughter and the butler. He placed the statue in his office and the interred the bodies in two separate rooms in his new mansion. No one is allowed to enter those two rooms.
The ghosts of the butler and the girl still haunt the Old Chateau to this very day. The butler is still desperately trying to find the Antidote, but he does not know that he will reach the girl in time. As for the girl, she is still waiting for the Antidote in her room, but she does not know that she will live.

My theory is that ~~this new Mewtwo is a *transformation* of Mewtwo. Not a new form, or evolution. A *transformation*.~~ Mewtwo's new form was earned, bestowed upon him, or otherwise symbolizing a redemption.



Mewtwo is completely man-made, and that troubles him greatly. He has the power of a legendary Pokemon but with no place in the natural world. After the events of the first movie and beyond, Mewtwo ends up not as a villain, but simply as a lost and somewhat repentant soul. 

Perhaps, in the eyes of the legendary Pokemon like Arceus, Mewtwo manages to redeem himself. Make himself worthy. As a result, he is transformed into an actual legendary Pokemon and given a real place in the natural world.

 If so, that means Fantina may will appear in generation VI, but probably not as a gym leader again, because that obviously would be boring (one person as a gym leader in two regions, what?), so maybe Fantina will be member of Elite Four? From gym leader to elite four member, like Koga. But when you think about it. Serious? Fourth ghost-type member of Elite Four? And another woman? No.

Ok, so if she won't be gym leader and member of Elite Four, remember, that Fantina is a true expert in Pokemon Contests. That part of game is unused by most of Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum players, because it's boring, but when I think about Pokemon Contests in 3D... Wow... It would be really awesome.

I also believe that the player is supposed to interpret all this as folklore. Arguments are:

1) All pokémon are capture-able. Most noticeably, the universe doesn't unravel, the earth is left undisturbed, and everyone doesn't become spastic in time, when legendaries are captured and used in battle. They may have some incredible powers, but none of them are anywhere close to what the legends tells you, and none of them are omnipotent.

If you've seen Donnie Darko, you will remember a book entitled ['The Philosophy of Time Travel'](http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/philosphy-of-time-travel/) that gives some hints as to what might be happening throughout the movie. The second chapter in this book states that the two principal elements required for time travel are Water and Metal. This is where the connection begins.

I had never previously seen any connection to Time and Space through Dialga and Palkia's typings, but this is causing me to think otherwise. Dialga (Steel/Dragon) and Palkia (Water/Dragon) govern time and space, respectively, both of which are closely related to time travel. I am starting to wonder whether the designers had the Donnie Darko comparison in mind when they decided to type the two mascot Pokemon this way. Similarly, though as more of an afterthought, Giratina could represent the alternate universes (Reverse World) that are formed by the branching streams of time.

These three connections to Donnie Darko also lend more credibility to the [Looker](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Looker) hypothesis, at least in my mind. For those who are unfamiliar, this is the theory that the character Looker is based on/the embodiment of the Doctor (from Doctor Who), based on his tendency to pop up out of nowhere, his connection to time and space themes, his trademark suit and trench coat, and his spanning across multiple game generations and time frames. As an added note to this, there is a Doctor Who episode (a Tennant episode) where a woman refers to the Doctor as 'a looker', a slang term for a good-looking person.

The world was normal and very similar to ours but their were some subtle differences. There were no gods, people trusted others more as their were no wars. But up high looking down on these happy people was Arceus; he was pleased with the people in his world ( this is around the time god allegedly flooded our world in the bible) Arceus created Pokemon to reward the people. First mew then palkia, dialga and giratina to control his future creations. Giratina rebelled And was banished to the distortion world. Mew created the Pokemon by looking at what the people wanted. Some wanted companions and others wanted pets. And so new created the Pokemon we know today. He felt that they needed to improve themselves and allowed them to evolve. Some Pokemon are the manifestation of the bad things people believed in such as death and darkness. Other pokemon were there to be house pets and be neutral. I could go on but I feel I have expressed my point.

Also if anyone wants to question fossil Pokemon I say that they were created based on what the people of that time needed such as kabutops having natural weapons such as their blades. Aerodactyl was transport. These Pokemon were killed or evolved in a way that was not expected. Arceus gave us apricorns and showed us how to make pokeballs in the signs be gave to us. Pokemon like rayquaza groudon and kyogre were created to give Arceus a way to control or punish us if it is needed. The lake trio were created to represent the emotions between Pokemon and trainer.

Pokemon like Jynx, Mr. Mime, Abra (and his subsequent evolutions), and  Machop (and his subsequent evolutions) are an enigma. Clearly they are more human than their counterparts like Pikachu and Charmander. So, where did they come from? I theorize that they originated as a result of tests on human subjects.

I'll use Machop as an example. Lets say that you take a human subject, Subject A, and introduce M01 into him. The results would be something unprecedented. In the case of Machop, the result would be an increase in strength and physical prowess. Without an external stimuli, such as fire or electricity, and radiation exposure, the human subject would simply become a more powerful human being. Thus you get a Machop and his subsequent evolutions. 

Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Jynx would be the result of injecting a modified version of M01 into the brain stem of either a male or female subject. The brain would then mutate rapidly, becoming much like mews mind. Afterwards, the mutations would spread to the rest of the subject's body, resulting in a completely new body for the subject.

Obviously, unlike the games, the appearance of Pokemon like Jynx, Mr. Mime, and the other humanoid-type Pokemon would be very different. I imagine them being similar to a horror movie creature or something like that.

_____________________________________________________________


Things have changed from bad to worse. 

My team has been isolated from the events outside our labs. Unfortunately, it looks like our immunity to the real world has worn out. Last night the entire team met in the dining room to watch the news. After tensions in the Middle East boiled over in 2018, the relationship between Russia, China, the European Union, and the United States became worse than ever. On the right, China and Russia were backing Iran, Syria, and Lebanon. On the left, the EU and the US were backing Israel, Iraq, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. 

What had started as a series of uprising called the Arab Spring turned into half a dozen proxy wars between the East and West. Nearly three decades later, what everyone feared, a true war between the East and West, was beginning. Two weeks ago, the USS Gerald Ford was attacked and sunk by a Chinese ballistic missile. In retaliation, US Forces in the South Pacific, South Korea, and Japan returned fire on Chinese naval assets and the Chinese mainland facilities where the missile was fired. 

The war started shortly after. Forces and assets on both sides launched strikes on each other. Quickly Russia and the EU entered the fight and over the last two weeks things have deteriorated into pure chaos. The report my team watched last night said that negotiations were over and diplomatic channels had been closed. The US Government had issued warnings to its citizens in regards to the risk of a Sino-Russian nuclear strike on the US mainland. The horrors of the fifties were back and much more real.

Needless to say, my team has been on edge ever since. To add to this, our anonymous benefactor arrived at the facility this morning. General Joshua Surge with the Joint Chiefs of Staff… yeah, apparently during all these tensions between the crazy politicians in charge of the East and West, my team has been working for the Military. 

General Surge informed me in private that the powers that be had their own scientists working on the Mew question since the beginning. He said that they realized that this DNA could be used to produce advanced soldiers that in the event of war could survive even a nuclear scenario. At first I wondered if this man was crazy… super soldiers, really? But then it clicked. The radiation leak… these bastards staged the whole thing to see what the effects would be on our experiments. 

After our conversation, he said that he needed to move our research to a safer facility. He also told me that my team would be moved and that they were being effectively drafted as civilian contractors for the United States Government. Things just get better and better. One day we’re making strides in every field of biology, the next we’re being drafted to make fucking weapons. 

I don’t know if these journals will make it to the public or if there will even be a world after everything is said and done. However, if this does see the light of day, please know that we weren’t here to make weapons. We were scientists.

So, one can already guess that a Trainer Card functions as both an ID and as your Licence to be a Pokemon Trainer. But what about the money? So I thought, ""hey, why not have the Card also function like a bank card? The Pokedex could be the machine that allows transfer of funds from one trainer to another after a battle has been won.""

So how it works is, if trainers battle, the Trainer Cards would be scanned via Pokedex. The Pokedex would then transfer what ever money is given from one trainer to another. The pokedex as a transaction machine could also check your funds in your card. When you pay for things, the cashier would just scan your card and take funds away from that.

This works for HG/SS where you send money to mother for safe keeping. Because extra features can be added to the PokeGear, they can have a transaction function. So what you're actually doing is punching in a transfer command to your mother's PokeGear where she can then hold on to the money you send her, punching in a transfer command when you ask for it back.

Obviously there are a few holes in this such as bad guys who you still get money from. But if we live in the anime world here, it works just fine.

1366161015.0,33,self.pokemonconspiracies,1ci2v8,A new theory on Mew and Ditto,39,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1ci2v8/a_new_theory_on_mew_and_ditto/,"Yes, I've heard the theories about Ditto being a failed clone of Mew. It just didn't make much sense to me, as Ditto can be found in many other places than just the Cerulean Cave.
It is fairly widely accepted that Ditto and Mew are related somehow, with them both having Transform, sharing similar coloration, having the same exact shiny coloration, and even having the same weight (8.8 lbs).
But let's get a bit more in depth.
Mew is based on an embryo, and is rumored to have the DNA of all Pokemon (but doesn't really have ALL Pokemon's DNA, I'll get there in a bit). As you may or may not know, embryos start out as stem cells, cells that are incredibly versatile, being able to eventually turn into any kind of cell as needed. I theorize that Mew's body is made up of mostly stem cells, which allowed it to eventually evolve (Darwin-style) into the myriad of Pokemon we know today.
-HOWEVER-
Mew wasn't the first Pokemon. Ditto was. It is obvious that Ditto's body shape is much simpler than Mew's, as it contains no bone structure, and is pretty much a blob. This is because Ditto's body is almost entirely made up of stem cells, as the only organs or real body structure it has developed are its eyes and mouth. As some of Ditto's stem cells matured into regular cells, it became Mew, gaining internal organs, a skeletal structure, etc.
Ditto is also know for being able to ""breed"" with most known Pokemon. While it is easy to say that Ditto turns into the opposite gender of the Pokemon it is breeding with, it does not explain how Ditto can ""breed"" with genderless species of Pokemon, such as Metagross, Rotom, and Starmie. Some of these Pokemon are not even ""alive"" by traditional means, and most likely do not even have DNA. (However, Ditto is shown to be able to transform into other objects, via Pokedex data, ""When it sleeps, it changes into a stone to avoid being attacked."" -Gold)
This is because Ditto ""breeds"" by making a copy of a Pokemon by transforming into it, and going into an extremely rapid state of cell division. The, the Ditto created an egg based on the information it took while being transformed, which contains some of the genetic information of the ""parent.""
However, Legendary Pokemon are not breedable with Ditto because Ditto does not contain Legendary Pokemon DNA, as all Legends (excluding Manaphy/Phione, but that's for another time) were created before Ditto/Mew, and Arceus, not wanting to create too many powerful Pokemon, did not put their DNA in Ditto/Mew's genes. This means that Mew really does not have the DNA of all Pokemon. While Ditto can create non-cells easily, completely replicating things as complex as cellular structures without the necessary DNA is impossible for Ditto.
The move Transform is not the same thing as Ditto's replication, however, as it only makes it look like Ditto transformed. In reality, the appearance is only an illusion, as the transformation isn't perfect (as shown by the fact that the HP stat never changes).",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_1ci2v8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1ci2v8/a_new_theory_on_mew_and_ditto/,

*Here we go:*

The stones seem to work via radiated energy. The Pokemon does not have to break, eat, or really do anything with the stone other than touch it. This ""consumes"" the radiation (and maybe the stone?) which means that the stone does *give* something to the receiving Pokemon, which induces a forced evolution. 

This reminds me of a theory about trade evolutions in which the energy used in trading machines causes some Pokemon to evolve, seemingly forcibly. 

With these considered, I have a pretty lofty theory that even concerns the origins of Pokemon. Here it is:

**Major Theory:** Let's assume Pokemon are ""mutated"" versions of real life animals, people, and objects. The unmutated versions are still present in the Pokemon world. Now let's assume that was not spontaneous, but had a cause. Some external force, perhaps alien, or legendary (or both?) caused regular animals and objects to ""evolve"" into the Pokemon we know now, maybe *by exposing them to some sort of radiated energy.*

Sound familiar?

Also, there is a finite amount of Pokemon types. Let's view these as prismatic refractions of a ""white"" energy, or normal type (see: Arceus). 

So, ""at the beginning"" either a cosmic event, or a legendary Pokemon, delivered (or bombarded) energy to the planet. This energy was chaotic, but when certain types hit certain animals and objects, they formed Pokemon. **A less concentrated emission of this primal energy could have been trapped within a prismatic stone or gem as an ""evolutionary stone"".**

Now, let's say a ray of this ""Poke-energy"" smacks into a pond. A group of tadpoles inside are hit by this energy, and one wavelength in particular seems to favor them: water. They live in the water, after all. This mutates the tadpoles into what we now call Poliwag. Nearby, a specific earthen gem, in a rare occurance, is also hit by the energy. The entire area did, but for everywhere else that energy just got bounced off and dispersed. Not this gem. It's composition created an anomaly where the energy remains. A water stone is made.

Those Poliwag are too weak for that water stone to do much to them, but their time on earth and fighting with their internal energy causes them to grow. That energy within them feeds on their effort and eventually causes them to ""evolve"" into a Poliwhirl. Their energy has reached a certain point of change. 

Now, that water stone gets interesting. Poliwhirl's new energy level is compatible with the more ""pure"" energy that caused the initial mutation, and is now trapped in that water stone. On contact, that trapped energy is pulled towards the Pokemon and gives it a burst of it's pure energy.... boom, Poliwrath. This new energy even allows the Pokemon to develop a secondary wavelength.

Perhaps all Pokemon hold within them the ""white"" energy, like white light, but can only use certain portions of it. Or perhaps when new types are adopted they simply open themselves up to ""absorb"" the new type radiation that might still be all around them in a disperesed form. Personally, I lean towards the first explanation.

So there we go. Thoughts?

Some of that energy is in stones, which allows certain compatible Pokemon to evolve further by absorbing it's energy**",Items,False,,t5_2tpgv,1372009068.0,reserved3,,True,t3_1gx0zq,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1gx0zq/evolutionary_stones_discussion/,

The Pokeball is in fact a successful replica of the Lake Trios unique ability to use a Red Chain to capture and control a Pokemon... I think I can go a bit deeper...

Once the Pokeball became more popular over the normal bonds developed between trainer and Pokemon a company sprung up that began to develop better versions of these apricorn pokeballs.. Silph Co.

The Pokeball was not perfect however, as the catching Pokemon with them was not always successful.. Silph Co, began improving upon the product, till a more advanced form and better version was made.. The very same we use now. Much research was done, and diffrent types of balls were discovered and made with varying catch rates.. Silph Co. hit it big. It was time to create the ultimate ball.

Silph Co. created the ultimate Pokeball, the Master Ball, capable of capturing any single Pokemon... 

During the creation of the Pokeball, and its history, Silph Co. began to make and develop potions, ethers, and various other things that would benefit trainers.. Some were more mystical in nature (IE the Evoultion Stones, charcoal etc.) some more scientific (Magnet, Choice Scarf, Upgrade). Silph Co. soon monopolized the entire PokeMart franchise, making them even richer. This is why in Gen II you only see two store that are not Poke Marts.. These Mom and Pop shops... 

Now, why would Silph Co. have so much interest in capturing Pokemon, and monopolization the economy?? Simple... Silph Co. is actually controlled by a Mafia based organization.. Team Rocket, Team Galactic, etc... These.. mob/mafia like Families using the money from Silph Co. to fund their projects, and such... This is how Team Rocket was so easily equipped, as well as the other criminal organizations...

Well, I went deep.. Contribute, and poke holes please!

**EDIT:** Sadly, I can not think of a reason as to why Team Rocket might attack their own Company, or as to why they would give highly successful Pokemon Researchers a Master Ball, if you guys could help out, I think this might actually make a lot of sense

**EDIT:** All right, this thought hit me... Silph Co is not controled by the Mafia Families, but THEY are controlled by Silph.. Team Rocket attacked Silph once they learned the Master Ball has been made, and they were left out of the deal.. 
Silph soon took on Team Rocket again funding them to see where they would go, and to see if they would benefit them anymore... They did not, and were soon cut off, and Team Rocket vanishes for good..

(X&amp;Y)",36,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16eywc/going_deeper_than_the_dna_ahh_ideacombing_all_the/,"Okay so basically the main two theories are the X&amp;Y axis theory and the DNA theory. That's nice and all but those are pretty basic. There are some very good points to both of those but they seem to be pretty shallow. If you look closely though the X&amp;Y graphing and DNA can be related in a sense. First thing is the DNA strand in the logo. Now that's something interesting. Many people assume it'll be looking the actual DNA of animals, but what if I told you there are computers made of DNA? Yes, there is such an outrageous thing. So this law called Moore's Law (computer power doubles every 18 months) is almost dead on silicone. Around the year 2020 it should hit its max and we might be using DNA computers or basic quantum. This gives you this techy future vibe.

Now what's interesting is the architecture in this region. The Eiffel tower is silver and shiny, something very different from the darker realistic version. Their also is the weird silver houses in the desert scene. Now about that tower. It's possible to send electricity through the air, which pikachu did. Now what if that silver Eiffel tower was a representation of it convert to power that city? It's totally possible and practical and deeper than the ""simultaneous release."" 

If you look though the tech in each game seems to be improving, whether its the basic pixel density, or the fact that its now gonna be in 3D. If you look into this game you can get that sense of ""new!"" ""future of pokemon"" feel, and maybe the game could try to reflect that? 

We can't forget the basic X &amp; Y axis thing. Yveltal flies and Xereanas walks similar to the horizontal and vertical axis, but not a perfect example due to it being 2D and now the game (and reality) is 3D. But there is the other side of the argument which goes to say that Y looks pretty masculine and X looks pretty female. These seem to make sense. Now I've heard of a theory where they are actually just one pokemon but different genders. This actually makes a lot of sense with the possible gene splits and all that. I'd like to point out that legendaries have never been able to breed, but that could change as there were never morphed legendaries really either.

Now the biggest aspect of this is that they look alien. If you notice they are based of the wyren and deer, but they look a bit otherworldy. I've also heard of mention to that somewhere official. The key thing is that they have that futuristic look as well. If you notice those Tron lines on them this time are very emphasized, Of course this has been a trend since Gen III, but its more noticeable now. And why? Because the colors are very basic (besides the rainbow horns). They have gotten simpler and simpler which each generation, just like technology has in recent times. They seem to have a digital look and feel.

And thats the key thing in Gen VI, they are digital like. Futuristic architecture, futuristic game design of 3D, futuristic look to the legendaries, and more. Now where this goes? I don't know. As we know it's based in France which was selected as the most cultural country in Europe and they have general stereotype for not liking non-france stuff. Now this could be a bit of an extrapolation, but what if the Team (dobely doo) is something apposing technology. We saw the walking around with pokemon in HG and SS, so what if Team [X] wants to go back to traditional ways. There's a trend for terrorism for animals like the ALF movement and PETA, so it would be funny (and ironic) to see a Team PETA that tries to liberate animals, and fire bombs places to try to get back to tradition and to get away from tech. Now that might be a little bit to much, but it works with the theory. 

I just feel like with all the new game mechanics (3D and roller balding) and new look to the legendaries and new architecture in the game that they will be trying to go for a digital look in the game. It also can't be a coincidence (which it is) that Apple releases the iPhone 6, a total of 6 or so products this year, probably ipad 6, new google glasses, Android 5.0 (not 6, but still a big upgrade), a possible Windows 8.2 (reboot), new console systems, and a ton of new tech stuff. It would make sense to have this whole techy theme and have the villains want to go back to simplicity. 

tl;dr SO yeah, basically tying all the themes together seem to make the most sense to me. Future woop-woop.

In each of these regions, different Pokemon are discovered. At first, the regions paid little attention to each other, but as time went on, they began communicating. They began trading Pokemon across the world, explaining why some regions have certain Pokemon and others don't. Also, despite having highly advanced technology, they haven't mapped out their new planets or discovered certain Pokemon in certain regions. However, earth has not been forgotten. In several episodes of Pokemon, locations are mentioned such as California. Plus, since they are never shown eating Pokemon, which mean they brought their own animals to feed on. Also it shows why sometimes Ash asks things like ""is that a Pokemon?"" I mean if Pokemon were the only animals what else would it be? Finally, it explains why the population is so sparse.

My theory is that all Pokemon have either 4 separate chromosomes or 1 chromosome with 4 sections specifically for the purpose of coding for traits required for techniques. Each chromosome or section would have genes that could code for:
-Neural connection building (so the Pokemon can learn the attack)
-More actin and myosin microfibrils for Fighting-type moves, so the Pokemon can get stronger. (Fighting-type could also have different, more effective versions of muscle proteins.)
-Proteins to synthesize certain molecules or pheremones (Used for Sleep/PSN Powder, Stun Spore, etc.)
-Functional proteins to transmit energy (light for Flash, electricity for Electric, etc.)

TMs and HMs could be new genes using harmless viruses as vectors to replace an older segment of DNA with a new sequence. Learning new moves through experience would be, IMO, akin to the action of Cyclin-dependent kinases, only with new gene expression rather than cell division as a result. (If you really want to know what a Cyclin-dependent kinase is, ask me, or Wikipedia.) Experience could cause a buildup of a protein similar to cyclin. Moves through breeding would simply be heritable.

Additionally, each Pokemon could have genes in common with all others of its type. For example:
-Fighting would have more efficient versions of actin, myosin, and other muscular proteins.
-Fire would have proteins that could conduct heat energy, synthesize combustible molecules, and additionally be resistant to heat denaturization, similar to many archea.
-Electric could have proteins to transfer electrical energy, and insulated neurons to protect their brains from electricity. (I think that there would be a separate network to channel electric power)
-Psychic would have more blood to the brain, and an overall more efficient nervous system.
-Flying could have greater tolerance to high altitudes, with proteins to reinforce cell  membranes.
-Steel would have metal fibers integrated into their bodies, for more strength and power.

The following is the conclusion to the essay, so if anything doesn't make sense, just ask below! Hope you enjoy

So the universe is dying. This is hundreds, if not thousands of years after the battle of Red and Gold. Arceus can't stop the end of the universe; it can only ebb the flow for a little bit. Instead of prolonging the inevitable, Arceus does 2 things in the closing moments of the universe. It creates an egg, containing itself, and an egg carrier, with the ability to travel through Time: Celebi. Celebi takes the egg back to the past, back to the beginning of the Universe. During the time travel, the egg of Arceus reacts how it would if a Trainer would be walking with it. The super-charged steps cause Arceus to hatch into the beginning of the Universe. In the process, it creates a shockwave that sends Celebi back. But not back to the end of the universe. Instead, Celebi ends up somewhere in-between. Not in the past, but not in the future. Because Celebi can travel through time to wherever it needs to go, this is how multiple versions of it can exist.

*But why are some Celebis shiny?* Some Celebis are too close to Arceus when it hatches, resulting in a purple-ish hue to it. These Celebi still exist, but are much rare. That's how we can have multiple Celebis, and how the Universe seemed to be formed from nothing.

The legendaries seem to be seen as one offs in the Pokemon world. Despite some repeated cries that they must be breeding, I see no theories (other than the asexual breeding one) that really explain this

So here. We. Go!

* The Legendary Birds

Some of the easiest ones to tackle, they are merely birds that, like the panda, are a bitch to breed in captivity. No way would the day care center have the resources (Articuno likely requires a cold mountain, for example). In fact, these legendaries aren't even stated to really be anything more than rare, powerful birds, further supporting that they are just picky about breeding

* Mewtwo

Why the hell would competent scientists create a killing machine able to breed? Nope, the only Mewtwo's are the ones they created. Unless, of course, they messed directly with Mewtwo's mother's genes. In which case... Uh, way to go scientists. Nice job screwing that one up

* Mew

Mew give live birth according to the journals. I suspect that maybe, being the equivalent of Poke Platypi (instead of being one of the few mammals to lay eggs, they are one of the few Pokemon to give live birth), they may just be picky

* The Legendary Beasts

These ones are a little tricky. There are clearly multiples... Right? I mean, there are three in Orre and one in Kanto at the same time? ...Except XD can also communicate with FrLg, yet that clearly occurs at a different time than Colosseum. So what's going on here?

Quite frankly, I have no guesses at all. Were they Eevee turned into Super Vaporeon, Super Jolteon, and Super Flareon? If so, then maybe Ho-Oh took inspiration from other beasts and raised these three into that form. Or maybe they are just closely related to Eevee and as such, once in a while, a trainer finds an Entei popping out of their Eevee egg and goes WTF. This one is one of the few I have to file under oddity, unless the ones raised by Ho-Oh were either a dead set of Legendary Beasts (kind of weak ass of Suicune to drown in rain, though) or were just the very first (in which case what the hell did they breed with and why are they picky now...?)

* Ho-Oh and Lugia

From what I can tell, they are based on some specific legends involving a female phoenix and a destructive male dragon - both forms of gods - being lovers. So I suspect Ho-Oh and Lugia are just the female and male (or male and female?) of their species and have some intense breeding rituals. Or Lugia can be of either gender and Ho-Oh can too. Either way, intense breeding that they don't like to do near humans

* Celebi

First one to have multiples of its species and not be a breeder. I suspect all Celebi are actually the same Celebi but in different points of time. Perhaps some events caused time line splits leading to multiple Celebi that aren't the same. Tl;dr - Celebi is a paradox waiting to happen

* The Regis

They are golems. Even Regigigas is said to have created a set. What's stopping humans from creating their own set of keys to seal Gigas away? So yeah, the first robotic Pokemon

* The Lati

...Do I really need to say it? There is a male. And a female. Preeeeetty sure they can breed

* The Weather Trio

They aren't exactly giant. Perhaps they are very solitary animals that only get out once every few years for a breeding frenzy, and otherwise rule over their own regions. Or maybe they only mate when there is a death (they influence weather. I choose to believe that they can tell when one dies)

* Jirachi

Once again, a breeder

* Deoxys

It's a virus. I suspect the way it proliferates is very painful for the victims who are soon to become Deoxys. In fact, I even wrote up something fairly long about this a while back. Basically, it infects a victim. The victim flees to its family, driven by the viral infection rewriting parts of their mind. Soon they change and then infect their family, who seek out others. So do your part and kill a Deoxys today

* Lake Trio

They were born from the same egg - at least the original ones were. These ones have some interesting powers, but yet even Frontier Brains can have them (...Somehow... I... Am not sure where they come across such powerful figures). But they can suppress even a god's power. What if one dies? I don't think Arceus would take that chance. I think he created more and gave them the ability to breed

* The Dragon Trio

...HgSs has an event where Arceus destroys and then recreates the universe to give Ethan an egg. And he needs his power boosted by Unown to do so. Suffice to say, any cases of their being multiples can be safely ignored as non canon (except for Ethan's baby Eldritch Abomination)

* Heatran

They can be a boy or a girl (Wait, Oak can tell the sex of that, yet not a human child?). Not much of a stretch here

* Cresselia and Darkrai

They merely balance each other out. Darkrai's ability is even described as a defense mechanism. Since Cresselia is female only, any chance that maybe Darkrai is the male of the species? Would be handy if you could go near your mate without them being subjected to endless nightmares, after all. I mean, heck, the only time we actually see the two FIGHTING are in Mystery Dungeon, which is hardly the same canon

* Manaphy and Phione

We know where Phione come from, and it's stated that Manaphy just require cold water (apparently the Day Care Center doesn't have cold enough water). That one is canon

* Shaymin

Just a rare hedgehog that only breeds in flower fields that the Daycare lacks

* Gigas

There are statues of them all over that get activated. And they are clearly long lived. Perhaps they are like the Dragon Trio in that what you see is what you get?

* Victini

Only really stated to be a rare Pokemon. So once again, very picky about breeding

* The Muskedeers

Nothing more in legend than fighting in a war. So nothing in legend argues against them being picky breeders. Maybe their mates died in the war?

* The Kami Trio

All male only. So I'd assume they only breed with their own species, and we just never see the mates

* The Tao Trio

Canonically there is only supposed to be once of each (hell, Reshiram and Zekrom can't even be shiny, so as to keep with canon). So uh... Only way more can exist is time line splits

* Meloetta

Once again only really stated to be rare

* Keldeo

Part of the Muskedeers, see the theory I have for them

* Genesect

An extinct species brought back to life and modified. I... I think Plasma neutered them, actually

* Arceus

He's God. I think he can damn well do as he pleases, even be owned by multiple trainers at the same time

1356641109.0,31,self.pokemonconspiracies,15jaol,The League of Evil Professors,35,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15jaol/the_league_of_evil_professors/,"You'll have to forgive me, as I'm not a *huge* pokemon fan, but I've played red/blue and some of the others, watched the original anime and the movies that tie in closely to it, etc.  If you can poke holes in this theory, please do.  If you can add to it with information I don't have, then go on!

Let's start with the universe as a whole.  The pokemon universe *does* have regular animals, though they are seen infrequently.  Now and again a regular cat, cow, or bird will appear in the anime.  In addition, Pikachu is referred to as a ""mouse-type"", which implies that regular mice exist (or existed).  In addition to this, we know that pokemon can be genetically engineered (i.e. mewtwo).  From here it isn't much of a stretch to imagine that perhaps *all* pokemon were originally genetic experiments.  More supporting evidence can be seen in the fact that most pokemon do not have genders (Jurassic Park anyone?).  One last piece of evidence is the fact that the number of known pokemon dramatically increases every few years.  Perhaps this is a new batch of genetic experiments being released into the wild.

If we assume the above to be true, the next logical question is ""well, who is creating the pokemon then?"".  Answer:  The professors.  Professors are some of the very few people in the pokemon universe to have scientific training (this is a world where children are sent off to train animals to fight rather than attend grade school).  In addition to their education, they also have access to pokemon never seen in the wild (bulbusaur, charmander, and squirtle, among others).  If they were responsible for creating pokemon, it would make sense to save some low-level but high-potential pokemon in their personal stash.

But this leads to another question:  ""WHY?"".  Why would the professors be mass producing genetic experimented animals and then releasing them into the wild?  For this answer, we have to turn to Team Rocket.

Team Rocket has a goal; Obtain the most powerful pokemon in order to use their power to control the world.  With this in mind, having the ability to manufacture such power would be a tempting science.  Pokemon are actually the nuclear bombs of this universe.  However, unlike our nukes, pokemon need to be trained to reach their full potential.

Enter the pokemon trainers, gyms, and elite.  All of this is an orchestrated system that the professors use to exploit child labor for the sake of increasing their military power.  The professors indoctrinate children and set them to training and capturing wild pokemon.  

This next piece of evidence I'm missing specifics on, so someone please provide if you know it.  In one of the pokemon games, a previous winner of the pokemon tournament is seen studying pokemon.  He is on a career path to become a future professor.  In contrast, Red is seen in a later game on a mountain top, and refuses to come down.  This is because after winning a pokemon championship, the winner is given two options;  Join the professors in their reach towards world domination, or be killed.  Red does not join the professors and flees for his life.  The other trainer (name unknown, please help me out reddit) joins their ranks.

Giovani, as a gym leader, is somewhat aware of the situation.  He probably was not given all details, but he was able to piece together many things on his own.  This leads him to establishing Team Rocket as a counter force to fight against the professors.  Team Rocket is actually the resistance, fighting the evil professor dictatorship.

Last few nitpicky details my friends and I have come up with to extend this theory:  Legendary pokemon are pokemon that, like mewtwo, were able to escape the laboratories that they were created in.  Because they were too powerful to control in the lab, the professors abandon the plans and do not create new ones.

Genetic experiments also explain duplicate characters (Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny).  They are clones.  This also backs up why new duplicates show up beyond the original numbers reported.

I think I had a few more details but I'm not thinking of them currently.  I'll provide an edit if I remember/if there is interest.

It all starts with a single egg in nothingness. The egg hatched and upon doing so, it formed the universe. What was born from this egg? Arceus.

 The universe is still in a very hot state right now. Arceus created time and something to rule time, Dialga. He created Space and something to rule space, Palkia. He then created antimatter and Giratina, and he would soon regret it.

 Now, he created Earth. The first things he put on it were air, water, and ground. He couldn't let the elements be there without a master! He created Rayquaza, master of air, Kyogre, master of water, and Groudon, master of ground. He then made two Mews, one male, one female. Now he must create a master race. A race that would befriend the male and one for the female. He would name them Adam and Eve. He blessed these souls and all of their children so that they would never change their form.

Giratina grew tired of of Arceus. She knew this was the perfect time to attack, he would be weak after doing so much. She confronted him and out of no where, she let's out a super powered Draco Meteor. In a matter of seconds, Dialga and Palkia are there Defending him. He ordered Palkia to rip a hole in space and he forced Giratina into the rip.
He was very weak. He created two pokemon to commemorate this victory. Ho-oh and Lugia. He would sleep for now.

Now back on Earth, everything was flourishing. There were many more pokemon than Arceus had originally created and the humans made bonds with their pokemon.. The male Mew had died long ago. This left the female Mew lonely. In an attempt at friendship, Mew tried to create a cute pokemon to play with. She ended up with Darkrai. Now, even though Darkrai wasn't the cute pokemon mew wanted, he was the friend Mew wanted. They started to drift apart eventually never to see each other again. This left Darkrai with a void in his heart.

Rayquaza saw that humans started to live together in large groups. He created Regigigas, the colony pokemon. As the different ages came, Regigigas created corresponding Regis. 

Since Dialga had more important things to do, he created Celebi to bring eggs back and forth. And since Kyogre couldn't protect every sea pokemon, he created several Manaphys and Phiones to guard the sea. Dialga and Palkia decided to make the Lake Trio to guide heroes with true hearts. Mew wanted to help people so it created Jirachi to give a wish to those who truly deserve it.

Rayquaza loved to fly and he wanted to share his love with other pokemon. Thus Latios and Latias were born. (This one was simple)

Society is starting to get pretty complex at this point in time. There are huge stone cities in what is now Unova. Two kings ruled Unova at this time. They were brothers, in fact. They had caught a baby dragon together when they were young. They had a huge argument and the dragon could decide who to side with. It loved them both so much. It simply split into three pokemon. Kyurem, Reshiram and Zekrom. 

A huge war broke out. This is when Arceus awoke for the first time. He created the Musketeer Trio to protect the world from destruction. This war is what lead to ancient Unova's demise.

Mew, remembering Darkrai, decided to make him a friend, Cresselia. The hole was filled but Darkrai still wants to make friends. Everyone thinks he's a monster.

People started to build towns in Kanto and other places. Lugia Gifted the power of Ice, Fire, and Electricity among three Pidgeys. When they grew, the power changed their form. These are Articuno, Zapdos, And Moltres. They can lay eggs to make more of them, however it's extremely rare. These pokemon serve as protectors to Kanto.

I was thinking abiut the games in that respect and realized that pokemon could not only be relevant to that war but also to the post war economy social structure.

* Pokemom battles happen at will and never need to be consensual or escapeable, with the outcomes of battles always seeing a mandatory exchange of money. Pokemon are used as a symbol of authority and threat in a land that can no longer police its citizens, even in cases as extreme as the complete hijacking of silph co, one of the largest companies in Kanto.

* The towns of Kanto do not have any apparent government, with no mayors to govern the cities or clear communication between cities. Instead, the center of each town is the pokemon gym, pokecenter and pokemart. Not only are pokemon the symbol of authority and rule following the war, their value has also driven the economy. All major businesses and research efforts are on pokemon alone, with the wealthiest and most well known figures being gym leaders, team rocket leaders, pokemon scientists, etc.

* Even with their bumbling manuevers, team rocket shows just how much of Kantos economy runs on pokemon. To fund their sinister goals, team rocket runs semi-legitimate businesses in saffron city. Between the two fronts, team rocket can afford to hire dozens of personal guards/members, thousands of feet of floor space in a variety of buildings in the richest cities in kanto, and most likely a fair amount of bribes to keep such a large organization from being caught outright. Since the slots are a fairly limited source of income for an entire organization, it seems safe to assume that a majority of team rocket's revenue is derived straight from pokemon in some way or another.

* The number one authority any sort in Kanto is the elite four. As the top trainers of the region, they have the ultimate authority in deeming worth to other trainers in the region. The only way to even see them is to present all 8 kanto badges and defeat them one by one, almost making them above the reach of the law. They are also found in an enormously large and nicely designed building that is staffed by a variety of people. This suggests that indigo plateau is funded with taxpayer money, as well as pokecenters (as they do not charge for services), making the economic role of pokemon even more distinct.

* Kanto children are given a pokemon of their own at 10. This is deemed a coming-of-age event and is distinct in their life, allowing them to travel by themselves. Before getting your own first pokemon, professor oak very worriedly rushes you away from the tall grass, citing how unsafe it is to do so. This speaks to how dangerous the world is, that few areas are safe for solitary human travel, limited almost entirely to main towns and cities.

Red sets out to find his father, without consulting Oak.  This to me proves that he doesn't want to be a trainer.  So he just plain starts to walk out of Pallet Town and then Oak grabs him, shoves a Pokedex in his hand and says go forth!

Everything Red experiences in the game is an inconvenience to his main goal of just finding his father.  Every trainer that stops him is an obstacle.  He can't release all his Pokemon for some reason.  The PC won't let him release his last one.

[and this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/rr8p0/what_are_pok%C3%A9mon/)

My theory is that pokemon are gas-like sprits made of the damaged DNA of trapped souls.

When some one dies, their 'human code' becomes part of their soul, and if they are trapped to, say, the place they died or somewhere that was very important to them.

This is seen in, say pidgeys and rattatas were in the first route in R/B/Y/LG/FR, and it was also where you first went on an adventure. I would say that Rattatas and Pidgeys are the souls of young adventurous trainers who passed away.

Evolution is just the spirit getting stronger by the resolve getting purer, like charmander is the soul/spirit of a fierce, young trainer, who others could not yet fully fear, then charmeleon is the teenage trainer's soul/spirit, where they have enough resolve to finally start being feared a bit. The final evolution, charizard, is the feared dragon-ish pokemon who rules over land and sea, and the fully developed soul of the trainer, who has strengthened their resolve tenfold.

Edit: was thinking just after posting, and eevee's are a result of a small child (D:) who hadn't had time to know their resolve, and therefore is special and can learn a wide variety of things through exposure to different types of stones (knowledge or something)

Then there are pokemon like Hypno, who is the pedo-type pokemon, who was a pedophile in life, and when he became a pokemon, he was cursed, but at the same time given special powers to use against the little 'uns.

Also, there might be some relation between the first region being kanto, which was war-ridden (everyone has heard the kanto war theory), which was the starting point of people having strong enough resolve, when fighting a war. When the soldiers died, their spirits wanted revenge, and this created dark and ghost pokemon.

Edit: Was thinking just after posting and came to the conclusion that eevees are small kids who don't know much about the wide world and were just starting their adventure, and therefore could be influenced into the personality they would become.

**The Creation of Space and Time**

In the beginning, before time and space even existed, there was nothing. Only emptiness and chaos. Before long, the chaos took shape and became Arceus, and Arceus created Dialga, the Lord of Time, and Palkia, the King of Space, and along with them the universe. As Arceus traveled throughout this ever-expanding universe, Dialga and Palkia would become attracted to each other and soon a massive fight broke out between the two of them. Space tore itself assunder, thousands of years disappeared, and yet there was never a victor. Arceus, sensing the destruction his creations were making, returned to stop the fight between the gargantuan beings.

However, Arceus was not needed to cease the two's constant fighting, for powers that were beyond their control were to intervene. As Arceus arrived to cease the battle, the destruction that Dialga and Palkia had wrought to their own creation took shape, just as Arceus had in the chaos. Giratina, the Emperor of Chaos, arose from the destruction, and seized Dialga and Palkia in their confusion, and dragged them into their own destruction. Giratina showed them things that they had not noticed during their war; Arceus's will was joining space and time together to form creation. Realizing that their fight was folly, Dialga and Palkia calmed down, but Giratina's rage was too much at the destruction of creation. For ages then it seemed that Giratina would destroy Dialga and Palkia, for he was born of the most powerful attacks the universe would know, and in their pride, neither Dialga nor Palkia even considered working together with each other. When the moment was most dire, Arceus, who had been observing Giratina, a creature he had never intended in his grand design, stepped forth and forced Giratina into submission.

Arceus banished Dialga and Palkia into their respective dimensions, while making them swear never to wage war ever again. Arceus granted Giratina his own dimension, which he would intertwine with existence as the pillars for the next step in his master plan, for the Distortion World, as this dimension would be called eons later, had taught Arceus valuable lessons. Finally he knew what he was to do.

However, the battle between Dialga and Palkia was not to end, for Arceus's creations oft used both of their powers and, because space and time could not exist without one another, this led to holes where the two of them could wage war once more. And Giratina was furious, and would forever aim to contain one of the two within his world to prevent further damage to his treasured kingdom.

**The Creation of Life**

Channeling his powers into the canvas as he wanted it, Arceus started coloring the canvas. Deserts were made where the heat was too much, forests where mountains became plains. To aid Arceus in his task, he created Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza, to maintain an equilibrium between Land, Sea and Air, where Rayquaza was the peacekeeper between the hostile Kyogre and Groudon. However, Arceus foresaw how his canvas could be altered and changed by the cataclysmic power of the trio, and he created a failsafe, so that the Canvas could return to the state he desired it to be in: he created Regigigas, who pulled the continents according to Arceus' design. However, unlike Rayquaza, the mediator, Regigigas only had the Design in his mind, and would only wake when the world was not according to the design.

Eventually the canvas was ready for the next step. Once more, Arceus channeled his powers into the canvas, and created small creatures that fit into six types, each embodying a power that Arceus had.

The first type, the Mew, embodied Arceus' knowledge. Mews all had a mighty sense for knowledge, and were very wise in all worldly things. This knowledge enabled them to transform into anything they wanted.

The second type, the Celebi, embodied Arceus' connection to the canvas. Where the canvas was perfectly fitting Arceus' design, Celebi's were always there. Their attunement to this connection enabled them to pass through time.

The third type, the Jirachi, embodied Arceus' power of creation. Jirachi's, while few and far between, were always searched for by Mews, who seeked their ability to create things that weren't readily available. Their powers of creation let them create things from thin air, while they often only teleported things over.

The fourth type, the Manaphy, embodied Arceus' connection to all his creations. Manaphy's were Kyogre's friends, for Manaphy's could connect with any of Arceus' creations. Their ability to connect allowed them to swap hearts with any of Arceus' creations.

The fifth type, the Shaymin, were created as a favour for Rayquaza. Rayquaza was lonely in the atmosphere, looking down on all the other creations having fun, playing and communicating with each other. Every one of Rayquaza's attempts to communicate with these other beings were foiled by the terrifying power Rayquaza had. Rayquaza went to Arceus with the humble request to make him a companion, a request which Arceus granted. However, there was one catch: they could only do this over day; at night they would revert to their original forme, a meek grassball. Even the transformation had a requirement; the pollen of the Gracedia Flower. However, Rayquaza was estatic, glad that he was no longer doomed to be forever alone.

The last one, the Victini, was Arceus' embodiment of his winning spirit. Victini were strongly competitive, but retained a sportive edge, and never took a loss personally. Although they didn't realize, Arceus had granted the power of victory upon these small beings.

Arceus also created the Latios and the Latias, the next of his agents. Latios and Latias were sent into the rest of space to try and find intelligent life that could live in harmony with these six species.

**The Disaster**

For many ages these species co-existed peacefully, only ever taking sides when Kyogre  and Groudon awoke from their slumber, and every time Rayquaza and his Shaymin would force both sides to stand down. As time passed, Arceus started to believe that the canvas he had created was nearing completion. All that was required was that Latios and Latias returned with intelligent life.

Eventually Latios and Latias returned with a sentient lifeform; a bacterial lifeform that named itself Deoxys. Latios and Latias had encountered Deoxys by chance; while traveling they stumbled upon the meteor that was carrying the bacteria. When they were being transported to Arceus' canvas and passing through Rayquaza's atmosphere, Rayquaza, sensing the danger that the Deoxys posed, started attacking the meteor, however Arceus commanded him to stand down. When the Deoxys landed they mutated to survive in these new conditions, and for a while Deoxys and the six species lived together, although Shaymin openly avoided them due to their connection to Rayquaza and the shared scepticism, feeling that Deoxys held a power that would destroy Arceus' canvas.

Their scepticism would prove correct, for when a Deoxys perchance discovered that it could infect a native and control its body, much uproar started, and this led to a war between the natives and the infected. The infected quickly gained an upper hand as more and more natives became infected until only a handful of natives remained. Rayquaza, who had fought the infected to protect the canvas, returned to Arceus and told him of the dire situation and Arceus, praying that the damage could be undone, harnessed his power and destroyed the Deoxys bacteria.

However the damage had been done. Of a population that had once been well into the hundreds of thousands, Mews, Celebis, Jirachis, Manaphys and Victinis only numbered lower than the hundred each, and each species fled and hid. The Celebi's had fled into the forests where they discovered their ability to travel through time. The one Manaphy left became the 'prince' of the water, loved by all beings that would come to call Kyogre's domain home. The Victini's fled to far-off islands, and the Jirachi's entered deep underground slumbers, only ever awaking once every 1000 years. The Shaymin, while still plentiful, were scattered, fear of infection severing their link to Rayquaza.

This only left the Mews. During the war, three Mew had decided that they would hide in caverns within lakes in search for enlightenment, and it was here that, warped by the strong influence that Dialga and Palkia had in the region they had hidden in, warped to become the peacemakers should Dialga and Palkia ever engage in a fight on the canvas again. And so Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit were born. This left only a handful of Mew over the canvas.

Once again, the war had awoken Groudon, who, angry that land had been destroyed, entered a fit of rage, raising volcanoes all over the canvas. Rayquaza calmed him down and forced Groudon back underground. However, as fate would have it, a Mew was passing through one of the sites where there were volcanic eruptions, and was caught in the middle of a large chute of lava. Thinking on its feet, the Mew harnessed a far more sophisticated and refined power than Arceus had granted the Mew, and created the first Heatran, the embodiment of volcanoes. This cheered Arceus up, showing to him that his creations were developing for the better.

 Now this line made some sense. With pokemon having freaky mutant powers over the elements, how did humans stay dominant? Think about it. Let's consider pokemon to be animals. An Ursaring and Beartic would be fierce pokemon to encounter in the wild since they resemble animals. Not to mention rock pokemon, giant rock snakes, GHOSTS!!

 Another thing that sticks out is wild pokemon. See, just because they were caught, it takes SKILL and experience to train a wild animal. Not only that, if pokemon wanted to keep from getting caught, I'm sure they would be smart enough to notice that the commands are coming from the trainer. So why not attack the trainer?

 Also, pokemon just don't appear. They have mothers and fathers and siblings. I'm not saying all pokemon stick with their pffspring, but a large number of them most likely do. Why else would EVERY CUBONE ALIVE have a dead mother (somehow...)? So, a kid goes around catching pokemon, ripping juvenile pokemon from their mothers, and it's all okay because (according to some posts here) a pokemon allows itself to be caught when it recognizes a trainer as ""worthy"" or something. What about the mother? Would SHE be okay with someone taking her still nursing offspring? If I remember correctly, almost any animal that sticks around with her offspring until they can go on and fend for themselves. So, apart from trying to catch a wild animal, you're defending yourself from a raging mother (that would most likely attack you).

 You see, the only LOGICAL explanation I have for all this is the following:

  •A thread explained that the game is a televised event within a giant bubble thing that is big enough to explore ""openly"".

  •A biological experiment that occurs in the same manner as the above.

Well the first is obvious. The second can be to see which ""bio-weapon"" is more effective for killing.

The world was massively polluted, causing animals to mutate, screwing with their genetic information, and even the pollution gained sentiency (Grimer and Muk). The pollution was mainly in the water, which everyone was drinking. The humans soon learned not to drink from it, hence Fresh Water as a restorative drink. This is also why, when you surf, it says ""the water is DYED a deep blue"". The water has been completely destroyed, to the point where the government has to actually dye it blue. This also explains the apparent economic collapse in the pokemon universe. The economic collapse is why the economy is almost entirely based on pokemon battling, with pokemon (who DON'T NEED TO BE PAYED) used for most menial jobs (workmen, people running the power plant, etc.). This explains the economic collapse because the government (is there a government?) spent money dying the water blue in the hope of attracting tourists to bolster the already failing economy instead of giving it to people with jobs. That being said, there does seem to be a network of stores, (PKMN centers/marts, with the DEPT. store as the decadent expensive splurge by the company). This could also explain the exraordinary amount of organized crime in pokemon, in that jobs don't pay well so people, some of them scientists, turn to a life of crime.

Will they happen?,34,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/y9i94/wars_in_the_other_regions_besides_kanto_did_they/,"The Kanto war theory is pretty widely accepted, obviously, but were there similar events in the other regions? I have a few theories to get the discussion started.

Hoenn:

Hoenn has the most obvious setup for a war. One possibility is an ancient war between Lavaridge and Sootopolis, the Land and Water volcanoes, respectively. Magma and Aqua seem more like armies than the other teams, and with good reason: they might very well be proxies for two ancient, warring clans. One hailed from the Western, land-based part of Hoenn; the other hailed from the Eastern, sea-based part of Hoenn. I haven't played Emerald, so forgive me if I say stuff that contradicts it, but it seems to me that the games play out an actual war in Hoenn - the conflict between Magma and Aqua is an actual modern Pokemon war.

Johto: 

This region seems markedly peaceful in contemporary times; even the villains originally hail from Kanto. However, on Bulbapedia, it is mentioned that ""Lugia had previously had an encounter with the people of Johto when it stopped a war on the Whirl Islands, which were a single island at that time."" Could Ho-oh also have stopped such a war? 

Sinnoh: 

Who knows? I like the idea that the Underground was once used for some form of guerilla warfare. Also: could Sinnoh have possibly been on the other side of the Kanto war? I have no support for that, just a shot in the dark.

Unova: 

I think we saw warfare here, as well: Almost religious warfare, thanks to Ghetsis' machinations. Bulbapedia does note that at one point ""Also at an unknown point in the distant past, a civil war broke out in Unova that caused an intense forest fire."" This ties into the legend of the musketeers.

  Charizard, the fully evolved form of Charmander. That brings me two the difference between Marowak and Cubones skulls, In my opinion its merely a different angle. Like how a shadow seems bigger than it is if the object that casts it is at a different angle from the sun.

Now this makes sense if you look at the real world, were states and goverments are basicly nothing but the place were the power of voilence is consentrated. Kings and Emperors' only authority came from the size of there army and the sophistication of their guns. 

So, if pokemon have the potential to be more powerful then the strongest weapons, such as legendary pokemon, surely the persons with the strongest pokemon would become the most powerful people troughout history, probably establishing kingdoms and empires which shape the world.

Now, in modern times, we don't have a lot of kingdoms and empires, we have democracies and republics which mainly arose from the realization that one group having all the power is not only injust but also hazardous to society.

Now surely a modern nation like the pokemon nation would have had the same philosophical realization as we have. And I like to think that taht is the reason why mothers sent out their young children to be pokemon trainers. It is a deliberate societal structure in an attempt to democratize the power of the nation. If one king spends all his life training his pokemon while the commoners have to work for foor and could never challenge the kings power. If every young child learns to train his own pokemon, then everyone has a chance in making it big and a certain balance of powers is achieved

I hope I didn't bore you guys ;)

I'm not sure if the connections will make sense to anyone else, but in my opinion, the world of Pokemon is an alternate universe of Earth, with the exact same geography, but further in the future, and animals have evolved down the line until we have these creatures known as Pocket Monsters. Now, as we see with men like Giovanni and Cyrus, there are evil people in that world. There also aren't many technological advances, and the islands the people live on are usually small, relatively small compared to the massive continents we live on. 

Here it is in a nutshell, then I will go into further explanation. The world of Pokemon has been scarred by war, and the few inhabitable islands are refugees for surviving humans to escape. Barely any technology made it out of the war, and most of it was to escape. Towns were quickly set up in these uninhabited places so that the few people could have a place to live, but they never returned to the real world because the continents were to radiation scarred to continue life. This caused genetic mutations among the animals, and rapid evolution. The people on the islands turned playing with these animals, and training them to protect yourself from feral animals into a sport, and eventually, after several years of life on those islands, became used to it, and made a league out of training the creatures. The SS. Anne was an escape ship, used by the military to transport many people, and was several years old by the time your character took your journey, and had been refurbished into a cruise liner. If you go by the Anime, that voyage after you left was also its last. The truck near it is one of the few remaining transports to carry people around the island, and it broke down near the ship. No one needed it, because of how quick it was to walk around the island. Also, there is propaganda everywhere of how good your life is there, and how great living with the newly dubbed ""Pokemon"" was. Everyone talks about how they like it, and the few newly built places to entertain yourself were originated and revolved around Pokemon.

1361713385.0,27,self.pokemonconspiracies,194r56,Ditto Theory Part VI: Mewtwo,43,16,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/194r56/ditto_theory_part_vi_mewtwo/,"[Previously on Ditto Theory] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16ipkf/ditto_theory_part_v_areaspecific_evolution/)...

So, the popular (banned) theory on Ditto and Mew is that Ditto is a failed clone of Mew.  However, why do people call Mewtwo a successful clone of Mew?

According to the [journals] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mansion_journals) you find in the Pokemon Mansion, explorers found Mew in the forests of South America.  They brought it to Kanto, where it gave birth.  They couldn't control the baby, as it was too powerful, which it is assumed led to the events that caused the Pokemon Mansion to partially burn down.

So, Mewtwo is Mew's child.  If so, why is it so different?

Let's look at the differences between them:

* Different size and weight
* Different Dex color
* Different bone structure, including paws, tail, head, and chest
* Different Base and Pokeathlon stats
* Only 5 moves in common, and only 2 of those learned at a similar level
* Different TM/HM capabilities and Tutor Move capabilities
* Different shiny coloration
* Most importantly, Mewtwo has *no* transformative capabilities

So why do these two Pokemon, considered to be parent and child, have such drastic differences?  I submit this theory:

When Mew was captured, it was because it was close to giving birth, and thus weakened.  Due to being the progenitor, Mew's pregnancy was not like a Pokemon's, it is more akin to a regular animal's birth.  Its usual defense of transforming to hide was not possible; transforming would hurt the baby.  So the pregnant Mew was brought to Cinnabar Island in Kanto.  Under the watchful eye of the scientists, it gave birth to a new Mew.  Now free to transform again, Mew escaped, since the scientists had no safeguards for this.

However, the scientists noticed something important:  Every time Mew transformed, a piece was left behind.  This piece could still move, as if it had a life of its own.  This living blob, along with the data they had that revealed Mew as the genetic ancestor of every Pokemon, led them to arrive at this conclusion:  That all Pokemon are born from these blobs.

Now, though, they had a problem:  How to keep the baby Mew from escaping as well?  It's transformative capabilities were not as strong yet, but it would surely one day escape.  They decided to attempt something drastic:  Injecting it with the genetic material of an already transformed Ditto, specifically, that of an Alakazam.  However, while this greatly enhanced its psychic abilities, it did not hinder its transformations.  Then, they did the unthinkable.  They injected human DNA into the baby Mew.  

*ADDENDUM:  Some have pointed out that Mewtwo might have been a clone that Mew was impregnated with, in which case I offer the following changes to the story:  Mew was still unable to escape due to the pregnancy.  The scientists were still unaware of the transformative abilities.  But, they added the Alakazam and human DNA* before *impregnating Mew, basically to fill out the missing parts of genetic code, a la Jurassic Park.  The inability of Mewtwo to transform was not due to a purposeful action, but rather a mistake due to a misunderstanding of Mew's abilities.  The rest is the same.*

This non-Pokemon DNA caused rapid and dramatic change in the baby.  It quickly grew to be 2 meters tall, weighing 269 pounds.  It's transformative abilities had finally been supressed, but its psychic abilities had only increased.  Unstable and psychotic due to the conflicting DNA inside it, it eventually broke out of the Mansion.  However, it could not hide the way its mother had always done.  It was forced to retreat to a location where few would bother it.  It eventually found Cerulean Cave.

**TL;DR:  Mew produces Ditto by transforming, and Mewtwo is its baby/clone injected with DNA from an Alakazam and a human.**",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1361799230.0,,,True,t3_194r56,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/194r56/ditto_theory_part_vi_mewtwo/,

During the period between Gen 1 and Gen 2, Agatha died. Giovanni fled, after losing multiple times to the boy. Earlier, he would have been able to make the argument that he wasn't trying his hardest. He never carried his strongest pokemon's with him, instead opting to leave them at the gym. His personal life (Team Rocket) and his job (Gym Leader) were two different things, and he would prefer not to mix the two. After the devastating loss, first to Blue, then to Red, he began to wonder whether he had lost his touch. He fled looking for Mewtwo, a clone that he knew Blaine was working on. Finding out that Red had either destroyed him or captured him, drove Giovanni into a frenzy and he ran to Johto, hoping for a new beginning. Blaine, the scientist he is, accidentally destroyed Cinnabar Island. After considering Sabrina, they thought that she would not want to give up her gym only to let the fighting gym take over. Asking Koga, he was thrilled too. He asked his daughter to take care of his gym for him. To prepare for his new role, Koga traveled to Johto and trained there (explaining his gen 2 pokemon.) Lorelei, inspired by the new findings from the scientists of Johto, decides to go pursue science, and forfeits the spot. After holding a tournament to see who will replace her, Will ends up replacing her. Soon Red decides to go to Johto (explained in the next paragraph) and forfeits his place as Champion. Lance, being one of the few dragon exclusive trainers, decides to take the mantle. He asks Blue, first (of course) but Blue decides that he would fit better as a Gym Leader. He thinks that a dragon themed gym would be too overwhelming, and plus its closer to his home (barely, if I'm remembering the map correctly, but he doesn't have to fly home to get past Victory Road.) Wondering how they were going to replace Lance, a mysterious person from Johto comes along, saying that she has been training privately with Agatha. After battling her, they see that she is a very skilled trainer. They are surprised that she uses dark, but it does match with her story of being trained by Agatha. No one knows if it is true or not, so they don't advertise it as such. Her, herself, almost never references it unless she has too.

Now Johto is known a lot for there science. Professor Oak is the forerunner of science (being the oldest) but he still goes to Johto often. Even Bill goes to Johto a few times. Johto has been the most technologically adept (Poke-Walker, phones, built- in maps, a radio show, etc). Even the time machine was developed in Johto. They have the gym leaders, but were not interested in developing there own Elite 4. Eventually, Kanto agreed that by getting all 8 gym badges of either Johto or Kanto, will qualify them to enter the Elite 4. (I don't remember if the location changed, but that's easy to rectify saying the Elite 4 wanted to find common grounds between the two.) Now, the Elite 4 would remain in the Kanto territory, but Johto people were allowed to use it. Red, however, thought that something should separate Johto as well; something like an Elite 4. He knew that there was no ""Victory Road"" in Johto, but there was Mt Silver. It was more complicated then Victory Road. And at the end of that arduous journey they would face him. Akin to not being able to visit a center during Elite 4, there were no healing grounds in Mt Silver. Only the best would challenge him. But being there took his toll. And he started to grow weaker. When finally, a challenger approached, Red was too weak to speak. He knew this would be a worthy fight. Not many people could boast 16 gym badges. Though physically weak, he grew a bond with his Pokemon. He battled non-verbally, and he battled hard, and in the end, he lost. He wasn't sad, though. It was always his dream to see great trainers, and here he saw one of the greater ones. He passed away, from the fatigue of living on top of a mountain alone and the heat of the battle. 

Nobody blamed Gold for Red's death. Many thought that Red got too cocky. He became too arrogant in his skills. He had traveled through Kanto, but never to the extent of climbing Mt Silver. He had no skills in foraging, especially in a cave. Still, Gold felt guilty. When they found that the boy was from Kanto, they blamed travelers fatigue. They blamed a lot of things, but it kept coming back to being from Kanto. They increased regulations on traveling across regions. Its not impossible, just extremely hard. 

Hoenn and Sinnoh were close enough that they were able to get some Pokemon from Johto and Kanto, through trainers releasing Pokemon and such. Hoenn decided to implement an Elite 4 system too, especially since trainers could no longer go to Kanto to battle there's. They based the trainers on Kanto's, to include Dark, Ice, Ghost, and Dragon. Steven was the leader, but after losing to Ruby, he finally had an excuse to retire and chase his real passion. They asked Wallace if he would be willing to step in as an Elite 4 member, but refused, exclaiming that he wanted to be Champion. Many thought that Drake would be a great Champion, but Drake refused. He was content as an Elite 4 member. Unlike the Kanto's E4, Hoenn chose the Champion similar to choosing gym leaders and E4 members, and eventually Wallace was allowed to join as Champion if, and only if, he was able to find a replacement for his gym. After begging Juan, his mentor, to step out of retirement, Wallace became champion. 

I don't know enough about Sinnoh and Unova to really comment on them (I just recently got my first DS, so I have some catching up to do.) What I will say is that Sinnoh based there gyms loosely on Kanto's (Kanto was revolutionary in this aspect) but for there E4 decided to keep it original. Unova is too far to have Pokemon from earlier generations. They know almost nothing about Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, or Sinnoh, except the gym leaders and E4. They mimic that, but don't get it exactly right (the three gym leaders of the first gym, for example.) If I'm hearing right about B2/W2 having older generations, and the world tournament, my guess is that they have started getting lenient again with traveling across regions, with Unova being the forerunner. 

EDIT: Red doesn't die. As battlemaster93 pointed out, he is in the world tournament. If this is the case, then after the battle, Red collapses due to exhaustion. He is taken to a hospital. where they find that he is the boy from Kanto, and how dangerous traveling through regions can be. Also if Agatha is in the world tournament, she is merely a ghost.

**Plot and Team Flare** As you know, Team Flare's goal is money, and because they are the enemy team, they will try to get rich at any cost. They are also experimenting with reviving fossil Pokemon, based on some screenshots, and in Pokemon, fossils are revived Jurassic Park-Style, by taking a DNA sample from the fossil and using that to re-create the Pokemon. Team Flare are interested in this because they want to practice DNA manipulation. What they are trying to do is edit DNA to create a super-gene to inject into Pokemon to make them better. Other than the fossils, their other experiments include the new Mewtwo forme(s), as well as Xerneas and Yveltal.

**Xerneas** After TF created an experimental version of the super gene, they took two Pokemon, one being a heavy-injured Sawsbuck (based on Xerneas' general body shape being most like that of Sawsbuck, not Stantler), and tested their new gene on it. The Sawsbuck's DNA sequence accepted the super gene, but at a cost. The new gene mutated the Sawsbuck, turning its fur an unnatural blue color, making its ears grow longer, and causing the vegetation on it to rot off, theoretically making it a pure-normal type, among other things. Also, the reason for its Fairy type is because the gene kept on mutating it. However, the gene crippled it, forcing TF to give it slight cybernetics, which is why its body is a sleek, metallic black color and why it has strange lights on its antlers and flank. The reason it is the ""Life"" Pokemon is because it had its life given back by science. Also, the reason plants grow is because the super-gene sort of radiates out from it, affecting the plant life nearby. Xerneas is not intentionally making the plants grow.

**Yveltal** The other Pokemon that TF tested the super gene on was a Noivern. Similar to Xerneas, the Noivern's DNA sequence accepted the super-gene and allowed it to mutate. As a result, the Noivern's body became translucent, making its veins appear exposed (what the black markings on Yveltal are), turning its back into a rubbery-yet-strong material, making the claws on its wings grow larger, etc. However, the super-gene also corrupted the Noivern, making it even more destructive than before (why Yveltal is the ""Destruction"" Pokemon), and its lust for destruction took over its mind, causing its previous majestic Dragon type to become a petty Dark type instead.
Later, both of newly-mutated Pokemon, dubbed ""Xerneas"" and ""Yveltal"" (their names were inherited from the name of their super-gene treatment programs) when crazy from the super-gene and returned to where they were originally from, Xerneas returned to to the forest it was captured in, and Yveltal took back to the skies. Now, it is up to you to capture these mutated Pokemon before TF can recapture them and extract the super-gene (in the process of mutation, a stupid grunt accidentally administered ALL of the super-gene onto Xern/Yvel) to market, giving the richer trainers an unfair advantage in battles.

**tl;dr**: Team Flare makes a super-gene in a hope to sell it and get rich from it, and test the super-gene on two Pokemon whom later get mutated into the version mascots, going along with the DNA theme of Gen 6.",Pokemon X/Y,False,,t5_2tpgv,1375417480.0,newgeneration,,True,t3_1jjcdh,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1jjcdh/my_revised_theory_on_xerneas_yveltal_team_flare/,

Maybe I'm wrong here but from what I've read one of the most popular theories about how a transporter works is that they don't actually beam you anywhere. They make digital copy of whatever is in their path, break down the matter, storing it in it's matter database (couldn't find anywhere where it says what this is called). Then sends the copied data where ever it's supposed to go which is reconstructed from matter on the recieving end. It's basically a really advanced Fax machine.

After thinking about it, it seems to me that Pokeballs do exactly the same thing. They scan and copy the pokemon, breakdown it's matter, store it in the hollow area of the pokeball, and reconstruct it the next time it's used.

I was wondering how fossil pokemon fit into the theory that is all pokemon are mutations and a result of some sort of radiation from the past. If that is the case, then how do pokemon even from 300 million years back know 'moves' which 'modern' pokemon have learned and are capable of using 'unnatural' abilities. For example Omanyte and their ability to use water gun or Archen and their ability to use dragon breath. What I am trying to get at is that pokemon may have always existed in the pokemon world. There were no 'true animals' to have ever existed in the pokemon world. This dazzling, beautiful world we had seen through the bright screens of several past and modern consoles may not have been the Earth we know and loathe, despite having many strikingly similar land features. Perhaps.

 Though, that may not be the case at all. Taking a look at all the pokemon classified as 'fossil pokemon' every currently know pokemon is a rock typed pokemon. A result of the transition between fossilized to living? If I recall correctly, fossils are put into some sort of machine which briefly(?) returns the pokemon to it's living state. Does the machine utilize some sort of radiation to convert a fossil back to it's living state? Also, because all 'fossil pokemon' are rock typed, does that imply that these machines are incapable of seperating the chunks and bits of earth from the organic material in the process of revival? If the world was indeed the Earth we know and had 'true animals and prehistoric creatures'... does it imply that the radiation used to mutate animals into pokemon is used in the process of reviving 'fossil pokemon'. Meaning that any 'fossil' revived will never be 'true' because they will be significantly mutated and granted abilities to blast jets of water from their mouth or whatnot.

 Another thing to point out is that most of these 'fossil pokemon' lose the memory of their past when revived. Though, they start of being capable of using moves such as scratch, wing attack, or constrict. All 'moves' which 'true animals' have me known to be capable of doing. Only when these fossil pokemon start to gain experience in this 'new world' will the mutation side of these pokemon start to show. This was just one thought. 

Another thing that made me think was, how does Relicanth fit into the picture? The species of fish pokemon which had survived for the last 100 million years without feeling the need to evolve. Or have they somewhat evolved? If we think of the mutated creatures theory and this world being the 'true Earth', Relicanth may have been perfectly normal fish but eventually became subjected to radiation and mutated. That or they naturally evolved with the times to be able to compete with the now far tougher sea creatures of the deep. Whichever tickles your fancy. If we think of this world as one which is not our Earth, one where pokemon have always existed since millions of years back, there could be a different representation of these 'fossil pokemon'. Having always existed as creatures capable of utilizing physics defying abilities, the earliest pokemon may have always been of the rock type. Relicanth can possibly be proof of ancient pokemon being naturally rock type and not as a result of mutation from nuclear radiation or revival radiation. 

 Why would most, or even, all ancient pokemon be rock typed? Perhaps this implies that the origins of pokemon are from within the planet itself. Though, this is still one of many possibilities. Questions or comments? Though I would prefer comments because my knowlede of pokemon is slowly dying.

**The Creation of Pokémon**

Uniting the Mews for the last time, Arceus once again channeled his powers through the Mews, and the results were astounding. Hundreds of different species, all unique and diverse in so many ways, all who had thousands of years of knowledge and experience built into the very core of their genetics. The life force was so intense that it gave life to the sun and the moon, giving birth to Ho-oh and Lugia, the Clefairy's, Cresselia's and Darkrai. The energy was so intense that it even allowed Eevee's to evolve into two entirely new beings, Espeon and Umbreon, as well as creating four new energy stones, which allowed some creatures to evolve.

However, Arceus also sensed that humans, while most of them good, there would be a time, somewhere down the line, that his creations would need protection. To this end, he created Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion, the Vanguard of Justice.

One more meteor crashed into the canvas, and from the meteor leapt a single dragon who held truth in his head, and ideals in his heart. Unfamiliar with the surroundings, the dragon looked around, and saw two brothers. The Dragon detected that the two were to be destined for great things, and he joined them. However, the two were very different, and as they united the peoples of the region which would be called Unova, their conflicts became more and more apparent, and the Dragon could not decide who it would help: the older brother, who followed his head on the path to truth, or the younger brother, who followed his heart on the path to ideals. As their conflict came to a head, the Dragon split itself in two, and the two sides fought, but neither could win. And so they left on their separate ways.

The older brother, who believed in truth, traveled far and wide, growing stronger and stronger as he fought the elements, and at one point encountered Moltres. The two got along immensely well, and when the brother told Moltres of his fight with his brother, Moltres was touched. To eternify the bond between the brother and Moltres, Moltres gave the brother his power. And so Reshiram was born.

Reshiram swore that he would never forget Moltres' generous gift, believing that, like this, he would be able to defeat his younger brother with ease.

However, he was to be proved wrong. His brother, who had set off in an entirely different direction, had happened to chance upon Zapdos and befriended him, gaining part of Zapdos' powers on the way. Once more they were of equal strength, but they reshaped the continent they fought on into what would become Unova. Once finally exhausted, they decided to go their separate ways until they found a creature with a conviction as strong as they did, who would be able to settle their battle for them.

Sure enough, humans and Arceus' many creatures started feuding, and Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion remained busy. As they saw more and more terrible things, all three of them had agreed on one thing: humans were bad news. Many times they appealed to Arceus to eradicate humanity, but Arceus, wisened by eons, decided not to and to let humans and his creatures to fight it out; Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion were appalled and and continued to protect Arceus' creatures, no longer out of order but out of will.

At one point, when the conflict between humans and creatures had died down and bonds of friendship were being born between the two of them, Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion encountered a young Keldeo, still a baby, in a forest fire in Iccirrus. They rescued the child, and raised it as one of them. When Arceus finally ordered the quartet of vigilantes to stand down, they all went their separate ways.

It was about this time that Lugia, the bird of the Moon, befriended Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, and they followed him as if he was their leader. The term Pokémon spread like a wildfire, traveling from city to city by manner of travelers who had partnered up with these Pokémon. Slowly but surely Pokémon became an essential part in the lives of the humans, having them as pets, working alongside them. The term Pokémon Trainer was rising up among many people as a person who traveled and fought alongside Pokémon, and an entire league was built to administer these battles. The first Pokéballs were created by manner of processing Apricorns, but the methods used remained a very traditional system, refusing to barter and spread the word.

It was about this time that three Kimono Girls entered Ho-oh's residence of Bell Tower, a shrine for Ho-oh where he rested, created by the feudal peoples of what would become Ecruteak. Ho-oh, very tribal, did not take kindly to this, and in the ensuing battle burned his tower to the ground.

Each of the Kimono girls had partnered up with a Vaporeon, Jolteon and a Flareon respectively, and in the fire their Pokémon partners sacrificed themselves so that the Kimono Girls could escape. In honor of these valiant Pokémon's sacrifice, the Kimono girls have, since then, only ever used Eevee evolutions.

Ho-oh was moved by this selfless sacrifice, and he honored them by granting them eternal life. Mixing his powers with the ancient, dormant powers that lie within every Eevee, Ho-oh created Suicune, a Pokémon that now held the power to purify water, Entei, a Pokémon that held a power closest to Ho-oh's Sacred Fire, and Raikou. These Pokémon would travel around the world running faster than the winds that they embodied, but always, once they had traveled the world once, would they return to Ecruteak City and spend a day watching the graves of the girls whose lives they saved.

It was about this time that Samuel Oak traveled the world. It was always Oak's dream to document all Pokémon, and in his journey he spread Apricorns, evolving the ability to capture Pokémon.

However, not everything was as beautiful as thought. Humans, by nature, were curious and at one point two professors, Blaine and Mr. Fuji, attempted to clone a Mew. They had found the DNA of a Mew by chance, but this was the opportunity of a lifetime for them. However, the extracted DNA did not succeed in entirely cloning a Mew, and Dr. Blaine had to step in to ensure the creature stayed alive by mixing Mew's DNA with his own, creating Mewtwo. Even with this intervention, Mewtwo was still too powerful, and he eventually broke free, killing his only friend in the process. Blaine and Mr. Fuji were still alive, though.

Some humans had created evil organizations, and one organization rose to the fore: Team Rocket. This organization terrorized the Kanto region, and had their sights set for foreign endeavors. For this they needed a weapon, which took form as Mewtwo. For a year Mewtwo served under Team Rocket, who had offered him what he wanted, but he did so begrudgingly, for the promise had been a lie. Fed up, Mewtwo exhibited frightening powers while breaking out of the device containing him. Mewtwo now knew that he was to wait for something strong enough to capture him, and strong enough to earn the title of Master.

Spies of another team, Team Plasma, managed to steal blueprints for the device that had contained Mewtwo and altered it to amplify raw power, rather than restrain psychic power. They found a Genesect fossil and revived it and started to alter it. The technology to revive fossils was sold, and once more did Arceus' Pokémon prototypes walk the Earth.

While all this has happened, this isn't broadly known among even the wisest of scholars: the only hints to the history of the canvas were left on Plates that had been scattered all over the world. And Arceus wanted it like this: the canvas had entered a state that in which he could leave it alone. And so, Arceus' will left this canvas to repeat this again on another planet. However, Arceus' physical shell would forever remain on his very first canvas, waiting for a Trainer that was strong enough, smart enough, brave enough and cared more for Pokémon than himself, to tame him and capture him.",Worlds/History,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,reserved6,,True,t3_1gclqq,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1gclqq/the_creation_of_the_pokémon_world_pt_3/,

Can communicate with pokemon.

When you access the memory link with BW, and you go inside the Ex-Plasma base in BW2 (next to Driftviel Gym), Zoroark shows you a memory of N acknowledging that nobody should be forced to choose between Black and White, good v evil...its already clear to people.  Zoroark, however, is nowhere in the memory. How would Zoroark know these things?

Zoroark shows you where N's castle is.  When you go inside, Zoroark is gone, but N is there. (Illusion wore off?)

There is a King's Rock in N's castle. Ghetsis talks about N being the 'king'. Considering the King's Rock is an item held by pokemon, and N is the one with the King-like item, it makes sense.

The one flaw I can find to this is this:

&gt;In BW, N has Zoroark is his party, it could be that same Zoroark.

Another Memory Link event shows N releasing all of his pokemon. All be has left is Zekrom (Reshiram). He even says its his last pokemon when he gives you the Dark stone.

1341467533.0,27,self.pokemonconspiracies,w2dbr,A few theories,33,6,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/w2dbr/a_few_theories/,"So after collecting much info from this subreddit, I'm making my first post.

Theory 1. If the anime and the games took place in the same universe, then Ash is older than Red. Since gen 1 and 3 take place at the same time, it would mean when Red starts his journey, Ash would be having his with May.

Theory 2. So this is how I see the creation of pokemon. When Arceus ""hatched"" from his egg, he really caused the big bang. Then he created the creation trio. When Giritina turned on him, Arceus told Dialga and Palkia to fight him off while He bannished him to the other world. But he needed to create said world first. Creating it took much power out of him. Once Giritina was gone, he created Earth. Then the weather trio to make sure the weather didn't destroy the world. Then the unnamed dragon. It split and Kyurem was the part neither Zekrom or Reshiram got. He was neutral. Then, finally, he created Mew. He told mew to fill the world with pokemon. Arceus fell into a deep deep sleep to be awakened by Lucas/Dawn. Mew started to slowly create pokemon. As she got the hang of it, she created more. Created Lugia and Ho-oh to watch over people. Pokemon slowly evolved into the pokemon we know today. Mew created Darkrai because she got lonely. He had fun for a while, but they went their separate ways. When she saw a great war, she Created the 3 musketeer trio to save innocent pokemon. Azelf Uxie and Misprit were created to watch over Sinnoh. Mew created celebi, but Dialga gave her the power to travel through time. The other legendary pokemon eventually came about someway or another.

Theory 3. Gym leaders use pokemon closer to the level of your team. That wouldn't be fair to other people in other towns. Lets say a youngster in Olepucid wants to start pokemon training. He's been given a level 5 starter of his choice. He goes and challenges Iris. She completely destroys him. Now let's do it using my theory. He walks in there and she uses a level 5 Dieno. Not so impossible now. Lets say he travels to Straiton city. His pokemon are level 45 each. The Gym leader then uses pokemon close to level 45. 

Theory 4. People who beat the champion get a choice to be a gym leader, champion, or E4 member. If there's an empty spot, that is. How else would they get extremely powerful people? Let's say Alder steps down. They contact Hilbert/Hilda and Cheren. One of them will get to be champion.

1339843396.0,26,self.pokemonconspiracies,v4vbb,Theory: Victini is not native to Unova,32,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/v4vbb/theory_victini_is_not_native_to_unova/,"**EDIT:** This theory is debunked, the information I based my theories around is not actually true. Ergo, the theories cannot be correct.

For anyone interested in reading through, the theory (my orignal post)is as follows: 

----------------------------

It has recently struck me that the ""V for Victory"" sign that Victini holds up is a typically Japanese thing. As we all know, Unova is based on America. So why have Victinis developed something that Westerners easily misinterpret?

The Eastern interpretation of what we (and by extension, Unova) call the peace sign is obviously the preferred reading of Victini's hand gesture and yet it only appears in an 'American' region of the pokemon world.

I've come up with two theories that could explain this:

Theory One:

* **Victini is not native to Unova**

Some of us have heard this one before, with lots of different pokemon... Like how you can't catch Munchlax/you can only catch two Snorlax in Kanto implying that it's a Sinnoh native pokemon and the ones you encounter in Kanto migrated there.

This theory would explain why Victini would use the Eastern interpretation of the gesture and not the Western one as it, as a species, developed *(see: Darwinian evolution/environmental adaptation)* in an Eastern society.

Theory Two:

* **Unova was conquered by Kanto in** ***The Pokewar***

This theory runs off of the idea that Kanto was locked in a war prior to Red's adventure, which I won't go into details about here. If you're unfamiliar with the theory, Google it.

The idea that Kanto conquered Unova explains how Victini developed the Eastern interpretation of the V for Victory...

Seen this on quite a number of blogs and forums. Dunno where it first came from but hope you enjoy! 

January 22, 2027: Dr. Hagiru Sato and his team of scientists from Japan, America, Canada, and Britain begin work on a matter-energy transference machine.

February 11, 2030: First machine is tested successfully after over a hundred failed tests. Controversy over the destructive nature of the technology ignites.

December 21, 2032: A catastrophic incident with an energy-matter machine destroys the city of Hiroshima, in devastation not seen since the atomic bombs were dropped nearly 90 years prior. Japanese government officials move to ban work on the technology, though Western powers urge them to allow it, despite the mishap.

April 22, 2035: First sighting of infected individuals. Most are animals; some humans are also shown to be susceptible to infection. Most seen around the ruins of Hiroshima, which had not been rebuilt.

May 13, 2035: Northern Japan is split off from its Southern half, as a nation-wide quarantine is enacted. Anarchy soon spreads through the infection regions. 15% of humans exposed to the disease are immune, no side effect. 84.9% are affected fatally by the disease, which causes cancerous-growths. .1% of those exposed are shown to successfully mutate. The “virus” is found to be a spreadable corruption of genetic material, which causes rapid mutation in infected individuals. All large animal life above ground is soon infected.

January 1, 2040: 98% of all animals in Japan are wiped out, ecosystems ruled entirely by infected individuals.

May 8, 2048: Japanese Defense Force engages infected individuals to preserve quarantine. Coordinated attacks by infected humans and animals are seen. High levels of intelligence confirmed.

May 10, 2048: They fail, and the nation of Japan ceases to exist.

October 13, 2048: The United States Carrier George W. Bush is attacked and sunk by an unknown force. Later revealed to be a coordinated assault by the infected. Use of atomic weapons to destroy all life on Japan considered, but denied.

February 12, 2052: Remaining inhabitants of Japan have appeared, by outward observers, to begin adopting the infected into their religions. Part of this religion is a total weapons bad, and the banning of violence against infected individuals. This is surprisingly effective at ceasing conflict with infected individuals.

April 2, 2055: Infected seen to have spread to North America. Military preparedness results in a far more contained infection. Hundreds of thousands in the United States, Canada, and Mexico die.

March 11, 2061: The United States Army begins experimenting with the combat prowess of infected animals, which are shown to have a friendly connection to humans who treat them well, much like dogs. Initial tests exceed expectations. Later that same year, China, Russia, Vietnam, and N. Korea react by signing the Kommu Pact, ensuring protection against the now utterly overpowered West.

July 2, 2063: The Kommu alliance declares war on the United States. Infected used to great effect.

November 9, 2066: War end. Communist states dissolved, China and Russia (and all of Asia) are now under the jurisdiction of the NATO.

December 25, 2072: The regions, now divided, that were once Japan begin to open up to the outside world. Mostly through scientific trade off.

February 1, 2081: Japanese scientists sneak into heavily infected Brazil. They recover the DNA of one of the individuals believed to be one of the first infected.

Beliefs are that the infected are actually the next phase in evolution, and to find one of the originals would better help the understanding. There are many tried and failed cloning attempts, before a final experiment is successful. The result of this experiment, capable of self-induced Energy-Matter transference, is responsible for the deaths of dozens before escaping.

In Pokemon Politics, I laid out the idea that many cities/towns are or were constantly at odds with each other, and that if cities weren't protected (geographically or otherwise), they would make alliances with each other. I'll give a few of my ideas as to what those might have been, starting with Hoenn.

First is Norman's Empire. Norman probably controls Oldale and Littleroot in addition to Petalburg, and has probably made an alliance with Roxanne. Between them, they've got West Hoenn under their thumbs.

Their main rival would be Wattson. I think Wattson would ally with Slateport, for the economic benefits, and Verdanturf, for their own small tourist/health resort economy, and to have a barrier on his side of Rusturf Tunnel. 

All the other cities in Hoenn are isolated enough that they wouldn't have to have strong ties with other cities, either by water or 2+ land routes.

Now for Kanto:

Viridian, Pallet, and Cinnabar seem like a good team. The two strong cities would be able to protect Pallet, and in return could get favors from Oak.

I think it's possible that Vermillion and Cerulean once had an alliance. This would be especially advantageous for Cerulean, as they wouldn't have the Electric city as enemies. (Assuming that past Gym Leaders used the same types.) It would also explain why there's a tunnel, so they could move people and trade goods past Saffron. Which brings me to the next part.

I'm not sure what Saffron did in the past to piss off its neighbors, but I hope it's in a game someday. Whatever it was, it was so bad that even to this day, the city remains carefully guarded at all entrances. Saffron even had to establish a second Gym to help defend the city. Tensions have eased since then, and Saffron is now a booming commercial city, but this would explain a lot.

Celadon and Fuchsia were probably friendly enough at one point to build Cycling Road between them. Whether or not that's still true is open to debate; though the many Bikers on Cycling Road might imply that that area is in a lawless state, and that crime has slowed contact between the two cities.

Lavender and Pewter probably just keep to themselves. Brock, as one of the weaker leaders, probably just wants to keep his head down. Lavender is out-of-the-way and without a Gym, so it doesn't have to deal with this stuff.

Now for Johto. (This is where my memory is weakest, so please excuse any errors.) There probably isn't as much Machiavellian politics going on here, though I feel it worth noting that many adjacent cities have type advantages over each other.

New Bark Town and Cherrygrove are probably allied, because neither of them has a Gym, and because why the hell not.

Goldenrod, having a powerful Gym Leader and booming commerce, doesn't particularly need to ally with anyone. However, if it did, it could ally with either Ecruteak or Violet, though I'm not sure what besides tourism those cities could bring to the table. Ecruteak also would probably benefit from working with the seaside city of Olivine.

Cianwood doesn't have to deal with any of this, being across the sea and not having people fly in randomly. (Their Gym awards HM licences for Fly.) I like the idea that it was allied with the city that was once where the Whirl Isles are now.

I'm not sure what the relationship between Mahogany and Blackthorn would be. I'm not sure it would be friendly though, with the whole Ice/Dragon thing.

Thanks for reading, and please fill in Gen 4 and 5 if you have any ideas. Again, this was the best I could do, I haven't been feeling too well the past 2 days.

Taking this into account, let us also consider the fact that steel is not a naturally occurring substance. Ever.  It's entirely manmade, save for in pokemon.  The earliest form of steel making that we have discovered dates back about 4,000 years.  


Also, from what I can tell, pokemon take the forms and essences of things from the world around them.  This is evident in pokemon such as trubbish.  It would be impossible to adapt to something that doesn't yet exist, and it is highly unlikely that pokemon would have created steel themselves.  There is no reason they would, and this isn't something that just happens by accident.


So then there's the factor of fire type pokemon.  With the hot flames from fire pokemon, people could have invented steel much earlier, and prehistoric pokemon could have taken it from there, right? Nope.  Modern humans only began to appear on earth 100-200 thousand years ago, while fossils take millions of years to form.  No humans, no steel, powerful fire pokemon aside.  


 Now, there are pokemon, known to be prehistoric, that are steel type. These pokemon are bastiodon and shieldon.  These pokemon are resurrected through the use of their fossils.  Normal fossils take millions of years to form, but steel was only created four thousand years ago, and humans only introduced 100-200 thousand years back. 


If we consider these factors, the question of how the steel type existed likely before steel *itself* even existed is raised.

I have a few theories, but they're weak and not based in facts.  



* Theory 1:  These pokemon were originally typed to the different, naturally occurring form of steel: iron.  Over time and with the introduction of humans, the iron type adapted into the steel type.  The modern scientists who remove the pokemon from the fossil simply upgrade the old iron type to the modern steel type for some reason.  It might be practicality, or maybe they are just unable to properly reconstruct the iron type (unlikely), but I'm really not sure.


* Theory 2: Since steel is simply purified iron, perhaps these pokemon managed to somehow isolate the pure essence of naturally occurring iron and become steel type.  

I think these are kind of flimsy, though.  Does anyone else have any ideas?

Whilst most of the Pokémon in the Human-Like Egg group are simply bipedal with similar facial features to humans, I think a human would make a very convincing Jynx without having to wear a full costume: just a dress and wig. Therefore, I think that Jynx could potentially be either entirely humans in disguise, or that some humans could have integrated themselves into Jynx's habitats to escape persecution.

Considering this, and considering the fact that Jynx are found exclusively in icy places, I was wondering whether they could potentially be a group of outcast humans who retreated to mountains and caves to form their own society. I was taking these things into account:

* They could have been ostracised for their affiliation with 'unacceptable' ideologies, or due to some kind of discrimination.

* Make-up (to replenish their supplies) could be made from berries or plants available in the icy climates.
* Remote caves and mountains are obvious places to hide if you are trying to get away from society: and Snowpoint Temple could have been an early building of theirs, before Snowpoint City was built, and most of them went further into the woods and mountains.

* Jynx are pretty rare in the wild; this could be since they deliberately avoid contact with humans to escape detection, and those that do get caught could be keeping up their pretence in order to protect the rest of the community. (Or they could be the real Jynx, rather than humans in disguise, since I don't think PokéBalls can catch humans?)

* How is the Jynx population being sustained, if they are all female? Perhaps some Jynx are male humans in disguise, and Smoochum are the children of this community. Smoochum weren't discovered until Gen2, one generation later than Jynx; perhaps this is due the disparity of time between humans retreating into this new habitat, and getting a society functioning well enough to raise children.

* In a world where people willingly run around right across the country, without limits, and are able to access any Pokémon move to get where they want, perhaps these people might have considered a Pokémon disguise to be more effective than forming a normal, human society based somewhere where they're likely to be found out eventually.

If so, why do you think a dissident group of humans would go to such lengths? Do you think any other Pokémon might actually be humans/be related to humans?

---

**The First Step**

The creation of the Heatran brought upon an idea for Arceus. Gathering all remaining Mew, he channeled power through them, creating the first fossil creatures, and the first common Pokémon. Kyogre's realm became filled with Lileep, Omanyte and Tirtouga. Groudon's land became covered with Kabuto, Anorith, Shieldon and Cranidos, and Rayquaza's kingdom was filled with Aerodactyl and Archen, while all were terrorized by Genesect, the most ruthless hunter the Canvas would ever see. Many of these creatures were granted the ability to evolve, just as the Mew had, into a more powerful being. These beings were prototypes, rough sketches of what Arceus had planned for the world.

Meanwhile, Latios and Latias had returned to space, continuing their quest to find sentient life. Arceus had called them back, but eons of flying through space had caused the two to become entirely independent from Arceus' will. They continued flying, Latios flying through dangerous asteroid fields, and Latias somewhat trying to restrain her brother's suicidal desires. She realized just as well that they had caused the destruction of their master's grand design, and both were fueled by guilt.

Eventually they found another sentient lifeform: humans. These were physical beings, and certainly could not infect anything. Praying that they wouldn't prove to be as disastrous as the Deoxys had, Latios and Latias returned with these humans and their pets, small, feline creatures that humans called Eevee's. Arceus was beyond himself in happiness, but experience had taught him that he would have to test these new beings.

**Arceus' Three Tests**

To this end, Arceus created Articuno, the Crystal Bird of the Frozen Tundra. Articuno covered the canvas in a frozen white, forcing the planet into an Ice Age. Arceus was pleased to see that, while many of the prototype creatures died off while giving rise to such creatures as Mamoswine, the humans survived, adapting to the rapid drop in temperature. Even their pets evolved, creating the first Glaceon. Humans that had fled the cold created a town on the ocean, creating Pacifidlog. When Arceus commanded Articuno, pleased with the result, to stop and the ice started melting, stones of frozen mystic waters remained, and Eevee's that came in contact with these stones also evolved, becoming creatures that could become one with  Kyogre's waters: the Vaporeon. Humans had shown that they could stand one extreme, and Arceus was pleased.

It was at this time that Rayquaza detected another meteor that had chanced upon the canvas. He decided not to act. The meteor crashed in what would become known as the Giant Chasm, and from the meteor rose a slender dragon. Curious as to where it had landed, the dragon soon chanced upon Articuno. The two broke out into combat, and as Articuno gained the upper hand, the dragon forced a usage of the great power that Dragon-type Pokémon have; however, something went horrendously wrong and the power warped into an armor of sub-zero ice. The dragon, horrified of itself, fled back to the Chasm it came from, and has hidden there ever since, preying on all foolish enough to enter the chasm and unfortunate enough to see it in it's horrendous state. This is the story of Kyurem.

The sudden change of temperature caused Regigigas to awaken. As it stood up, towering over the world, he noticed humans. Humans, who were very superstitious at the time, started worshiping the titan, building statues of him from ice. This touched Regigigas, and as he went to return to sleep (the canvas' form was still the way he had left it) he blew life into one of the statues and sealed it away. This is how Regice was created.

Arceus was very pleased, but this one test was not enough. He had to be sure. Arceus created the second bird, Zapdos, the Lightning Bird of Thunderstorms. Zapdos covered the world in perpetual thunderstorms, and once again humans adapted to survive. The techniques they had taught themselves over the ages with ice, they now applied to rocks. Species like the Mamoswine became rarer and rarer as humans started learning to hunt them, the conditions no longer suitable for an increase in the Mamoswine population. However, the storms brought about a plentiful supply of water, and forests began to grow. In these forests, Tangrowth flourished. Furthermore, these forests enabled Eevee's to evolve into an all-new form, the Leafeon.

These large series of thunderstorms woke up Regigigas once more. Feeling the powers of the earth and seeing, yet again, a statue of himself, Regigigas blew life into this statue and sealed it away as well, creating Regirock.

Zapdos couldn't uphold bringing the amount of storms he needed to on his own, and he requested that Arceus granted him helpers. Arceus, while granting the request, gave one condition: that there be a third one that would function as peacekeeper, as he had learnt from experience with Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza. And so Tornadus, Thundurus and Landorus were born.

As had happened with Articuno, Zapdos' lightning, when a storm passed over, passed it's energies over to the stone, and this stone, when an Eevee touched it, would allow it to evolve, so creating Jolteon.

When Zapdos' energies had been spent, Arceus ordered it to stand down; however, Tornadus and Thundurus did not while Zapdos did. Tornadus and Thundurus would continue to pester humanity and Pokémon alike, and humans came to worship Landorus, who had saved them countless times from cataclysmic storms.

Arceus then created the final test: Moltres, the Flaming Bird of Droughts. Moltres broadly spread drought, evaporating lakes, rivers, and expanding the deserts of the world. This drought was too much for many of the prototypes, and they went extinct. However, the heat allowed certain insect-species to grow, such as the Yanmega.

As with Articuno and Zapdos before him, Moltres' powers were given a crystalline form, and allowed the Eevees to evolve further, into Flareons.

Once more, Regigigas woke up. Humans had developed much further, discovering irrigation and starting to build up civilizations. Regigigas saw that humanity could fend for itself, and he returned to sleep after breathing life into the final statue, Registeel.
Once again, humans had withstood the tests that Arceus had given them; survived where the prototypes had not. Humanity had far exceeded Arceus' expectations, and he had finished the designs on the next series of creations. Arceus was ready to go all the way.

An example to relate this to would be the King's rock. Give a slowpoke a King's Rock and he'll put that thing on his head and completely forget about being a slowbro. Same goes for poliwhirl and politoad (minus the using the rock as a hat thing)

Point is, it is a theory I have hear before that simply every cubone's mother had died while it was a child, end of story. There is just some messed up thing that happens that kills EVERY cubone's mother and forces it to wear it's skull and cubones that don't wear the skull of their previously dead mothers simply don't exist. However, say you have a baby kangaskhan and it's mother just so happens to die before it could grow up into a fully evolved kangaskhan and so, having an irrevocable connection to its mother which always kept it in her pouch, the baby put her skull over his head. 

It's the combination of mental torment and the inablility to grow to the size of a kangaskhan that causes the poor little thing to evolve into a completely different pokemon, which by the rules of the game makes total sense (as with froslass, gallade, bellossom, ect.) Of course, this evolution branch would be hard to simulate in game as it would require the player to kill a kangaskhan post-motherhood and just giving a baby kangaskhan a skull as a held item would kindof ruin the mythos of it/

The answer: The player / Ash / the main characters are the children of the elite ""Kshatriya"" caste in a heavily stratified society, so their experiences are highly unrepresentative of the population at large. They live in a bubble where every kid is customarily given an incredibly rare starter Pokémon simply for turning 10, so that they can then train to become the next generation of elites. (I imagine that Pokémon training is much like learning a language - if you don't do it when you're young, you'll never really be any good at it.)

For the rest of the population, Pokémon training is largely unaffordable. The protagonists don't interact with them much, thinking them hardly worth consideration, but we do see a few glimpses of the underclasses, namely: the rather pitiable Youngsters, Bug Catchers, etc. who will challenge you with locally-caught wild Pokémon and almost always lose. Unlicensed training is technically illegal, but the elites tend to ignore it because (1) it's hard to enforce with anything short of a totalitarian police state, and (2) Youngster's Rattata isn't that much of a threat.

There is, however, one notable opportunity that is available to non-elites: Team Rocket. Most Rocket Grunts are disillusioned Youngsters and Bug Catchers with some talent who find themselves confined by an oppressive social structure - and although Team Rocket can't afford to give its members much more than Rattata and Ekans, it still presents the only avenue for social advancement that a lower-caste individual can aspire to.

(And of course, for that, Team Rocket is branded by the establishment as a dangerous criminal organization that must be eradicated for the scum that they are...)

But there is a cruel ending to this story - Team Rocket is secretly run by Giovanni, who is of course a Gym Leader and is rumored to be the father of Ash - so he must be a Kshatriya himself.

I've only been on this subreddit for a few days.

I've got a shaky theory, but I'm curious to hear yours. As you probably know, lunar wings attract Cresselia. They are green, curved feathers, and they are found in the wake of Cresselia. Cresselia, however, is neither green nor feathery. These feathers can't be coming directly from the Pokemon unless somehow producing green feathers which are attractive to Cresselia is one of Cresselia's pointless powers. 


I, personally, think that they aren't from Cresselia at all. I think Cresselia is chasing something. Cresselia is neither green nor feathery. Besides this, why would Cresselia desire it's own plumage when it should have an endless supply? The feathers have to be from something else, probably another Pokemon that Cresselia is chasing for some reason. Since it follows in the path of this mystery Pokemon, Cresselia became associated with the feathers instead of that Pokemon, probably because that Pokemon doesn't stop moving.


If it were looking for just a certain species of Pokemon then we would have encountered it already, but, unless this Pokemon is a Xatu, nothing green, feathery, and associated with dreams comes to mind. Besides, that would mean Cresselia would show up wherever Xatu are. I think that Cresselia goes after the wings because it's hunting a legendary that has yet to be revealed. The evidence indicates something  fast, green, winged, and singular.


Now, this coloration brings Celebi to mind. I am sure it's not Celebi because it is called a ""Lunar Wing."" Celebi's wings are clear and fairy-like. Currently, I have no idea why Cresselia is chasing this unknown Pokemon. That's all I have for now, but I might think of more later.

1371904373.0,22,self.pokemonconspiracies,1guprk,Extensive X/Y Plot Theory,27,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1guprk/extensive_xy_plot_theory/,"**Warning Wall of Text**

I believe there will be two teams in X/Y. The first will be an evil team representing science and the second team will be a neutral/good team representing mysticism/magic.

My reasons for this theory have much to do with France’s history and the land marks on the Kalos [map]( http://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2013/133/pokemon_x_y_Kalos_region_map_46486_640screen.jpg).

France’s political history is famous for revolutions and religious strife. I believe the main plot will revolve around the Science Team revolting against the traditional religious worship of magic in the Kalos region.  This is due in part to the introduction of the Fairy type and its relation to magic and moon-worshiping. It is also due to the Cold Steel theory that Steel will be super-effective against Fairy.

Before the events of the game, the Science team will have successfully convinced the Kalos people to abandon some of their archaic beliefs and institute cleaner energy sources and industrialism.  However, after their success the Science Team gets more progressive much too quickly.  The Science Team will advocate genetic manipulation and abandonment of mysticism in favor of power.  The Science Team will want to clone and manipulate the DNA of powerful Pokémon, with the aim of adding types (like steel), removing types (like fairy), and increasing strength.  The Magic Team will be advocating an opposite view that the Kalos people need to maintain their faith in the Fairy type Pokémon that protected them from the Dragons that plagued the Kalos region in the past (this comes from France’s relation to Medieval chivalric tales in which magic-powered knights defeated dragons) and leave creation to nature alone.  

My main support for this comes from the map.  As you can see, there are many places that can be tied to mysticism/magic – the Church (northwest), the Stonehenge-esque structure (northwest), the pink tower (what I assume to be a fairy lighthouse) in the northeast), and the big tree (southeast). Likewise there are structures that imply scientific growth – the geothermal energy plant (North), the lab (southwest), Lumiose City (center), and the mines (northeast).


Xavier/Yvonne will enter the game as the Science Team begins to search for the Legendary Pokémon of Life: Xerneas and Yveltal. The Science Team believes that by capturing the Life Legendaries they will have the power to manipulate Pokémon DNA. Throughout the gym challenging portion of the game, Xavier/Yvonne will encounter both teams.  Eventually, Xavier/Yvonne will reach the Fairy Gym (I’m guessing the 2nd gym because of the [PokeBeach rumor]( http://pokebeach.com/2013/06/pokebeach-x-y-rumor-roundup-and-clarifications)) where he/she will meet the gym leader that is also the head of the Magic Team.  After defeating the gym leader, the leader will try to recruit Xavier/Yvonne to the Magic Team, but the player will not be allowed to accept.  After beating the 7th or 8th gym, the Fairy Gym Leader will return and Xavier/Yvonne will be informed that the Science team has successfully captured Xerneas (In Pokemon Y) or Yveltal (In Pokemon X).  The gym leader will then task Xaveir/Yvonne will helping him defeat the Science Team by capturing the other Legendary. Xavier/Yvonne will do so and defeat the Science Team.

Post-game, it will be revealed that the Science Team had gone to Kanto and captured Mewtwo with the hopes of studying his cloned DNA.  After catching the legendary, the science team exposed Mewtwo to Xerneas (in Pokémon Y) or Yveltal (in Pokémon X), causing him to gain a second type.  By being exposed to Xerneas (which I believe to be Fairy/Grass), Mewtwo becomes Psychic/Fairy (the form that has been released). By being exposed to Yveltal (which I believe to be Dark/Flying), Mewtwo becomes Psychic/Dark (the form that has not been released). After the exposure, however, Mewtwo becomes uncontrollably strong and escapes from the Science Team to the Coastal Cave under the lab in the Southwest of the map.  In order to progress the game, a young apprentice of Professor Oak, Professor Sycamore (also from the PokeBeach rumor) will give you the choice of a Kanto starter and ask you to capture the Mewtwo. 

**TL;DR** Two teams: Science and Magic. Science is bad and tries to manipulate DNA. You help Magic defeat them. Post-game you catch Mewtwo.

**Edit:**Well it looks like my theory was wrong. The evil team is Team Flare and their purpose is to make money.

***MACHOKE***:

The belt around its waist holds back its energy. Without it, this Pokémon would be unstoppable. - Yellow

A belt is worn by a Machoke to keep its overwhelming power under control. Because it is so dangerous, no one has ever removed the belt. - Emerald

Machoke's boundless power is very dangerous, so it wears a belt that suppresses its energy. - Diamond

***MACHAMP***:

**One arm alone can move mountains.** Using all four arms, this Pokémon fires off awesome punches.

If a Pokemon like this exists in the wild, there would certainly be reason to send people out into the (typically) caves where it dwells, and restrict its power. It's obvious that humans have had a role in Pokemon creation because of those like Mewtwo, Porygon, Grimer, etc. So it's not at all a stretch to suppose they, through technology, restrict the strength of a natural Pokemon.

But see, after giving this some thought and actually looking at the internal state of a Pokeball I've come to the following conclusion:

(Now keep in mind that while this is theoretical, its actually physically almost all possible. First I will describe the elements individually and then go forward to describe how they all work together. Also, a lot of the science lingo is going to be numbed down. After all, this is for fun =p)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PARTS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shell:
The exterior of the PokeBall is made from a very tough, heat/electrical/water resistant alloy. It is essentially the stuff they cover the space shuttles with. Very expensive to make and mass produce. This explains why Poke-products- are very expensive. Its because most of them use this special alloy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokemon Meta-data:
This is the data of the Pokemon that is stored in the PC using a property of physics called, Quantum Entanglement. Its basically a property that pairs certain atoms together after they have had some interaction and have similar frequencies. A Pokemon's Meta-data is scanned the moment it is captured, or returned. (more on how this works in the 'workings' section)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trainer Meta-data:
This data is generated using a computer after the Pokemon Meta-data makes its way into said computer. It stores things such as vocal patterns, experience, age, nicknames given to Pokemon and other addressing information about the trainer that has caught the Pokemon. Trainer Meta-data is updated when a new Pokemon is caught/released or when the PokeBalls are purchased.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Power Source:
A Pokeball is a mini fusion reactor. If you look inside there are 2 strong magnets (both green) that are connected to lines of batteries (graphite colored). These batteries store enough energy to operate the PokeBall for extended periods of time, however, they do run out depending on the status on the Pokemon inside of them. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Button:
The button positioned in the center of the Poke ball is essentially an expanding/contracting mechanic that specifies the state of the PokeBall. If you look inside the ball you'll see that it is conveniently stacked into layers or parts. These parts can easily be rearranged using some sort of mechanic present between the red/white layers and the graphite colored layer we see in the image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sensor: 
(Mechanical)
The sensor is used to detect any sort of sudden impact with some sort of surface. It is made to not react to human skin. It also has a timer from last contact/new contact that basically lets it know if it was thrown or not. It also has an accelerometer that lets it know if its falling at 'g' or not. So if you juggle it for example or drop it off a building, you wont trigger the effects of the ball. The sensor starts the sequence of the opening and closing mechanisms of the PokeBall and it starts the laser mechanisms required to catch, bringing forth and returning of a Pokemon.

(Audio) 
The sensor also has some Audio properties. These audio properties only work after the Pokemon has been captured inside the Pokeball. The Audio sensor takes up way more energy because it is listening to stuff all the time almost. It also has a built in AI that needs to recognize some speech patterns and using the Metadata of the Pokemon inside names and nicknames. This explains why trainers almost always checkout the Pokemon centers first whenever they enter new cities or towns. It is because they must recharge their Pokeballs and secure new versions of their online 'Trainer Meta-Data'.

(Temperature)
This sensor helps recognize where the Pokemon nearest to the Pokeball is. Its basically a heat sensor that lets the 'Scanner' (read scanner below) know which parts of the space around the ball to scan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Scanner:
This is the part that uses lasers to do the fancy stuff. Inside the Pokeball is a series of mirrors. Based on data receives from the Sensor, the Scanner can now send lasers and essentially scan/entangle the atoms of the Pokemon in question. The second stage the Scanner carries out is pulverization. This uses a good amount of energy, but essentially destroys whatever it is you scan. The laser carries the information back to the Pokeball which now heads to the Transmitter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transmitter:
This part of the Pokeball receives and sends information about both Trainer and Pokemon Meta-data from and to the PC. The computers in the PC do a huge part in sustaining the data, so the transmitter needs to only really be able to send large chunks of data at a very fast and efficient rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory:
This part entangles one atom of the Pokemon to an atom in the Pokeball (probably more than one to be safe).
This allows the Pokeball to recognize where the Pokemon that is supposed to be in it is located in the world to allow for easier returns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE WORKINGS:

When you throw a Pokeball that still doesn't have any Meta-data linked to it at a Pokemon, the sensor detects that the Pokeball has been thrown and opens the two-halves. The heat sensor then detects the location and size of the Pokemon nearest to the ball and begins the process of Quantum Entanglement. (realistically it is currently taking us 3-5 million attempts to sync 1 atom to another, so being able to sync all the atoms at one go is a huge leap, but its possible!) When this happens, the scanner is essentially mapping the real world into a digital space. It's creating a virtual copy of the Pokemon(must be real powerful computers at the PC) The nasty part is that as the atoms are entangled the Pokemon's initial atoms are actually also destroyed. The laser scans the atoms, the Pokeball sends the Meta-data back to a PC through its Transmitter, then the laser pulverizes the Pokemon's initial atoms. But right before pulverization, we have the Meta-data of one Pokemon. The Pokeball encodes this information and sends it to the closest PC. The PC now has the digital information about the Pokemon. Everything including its moves, level and even feelings at the time. Now this is the weak part of the whole theory. Lets say you now want to release a Pokemon from its Pokeball. The Sensor recognizes its been thrown, and data is sent from the PC to the Pokeball. However, the Pokeball now only has data and needs to reconstruct the Pokemon from a blueprint. For the sake of fun, we are going to just assume this happens through the power of Arceus, because we all know that when we can't explain something, we just say God did it! (If someone can figure something here, post it in the comments) So scanning a Pokemon is much easier than reconstructing it.

So while the Pokemon is in it's Pokeball its essentially just stored digitally somewhere. Time for it has pretty much stopped, and the reason why sometimes Pokemon just come out of Pokeballs is either due to system glitches in the Audio Sensor on the Pokeball (Yes, you should get that Wobbuffet Pokeball checked up Jesse), or its due to the Sensor working properly and reporting that the Pokemon's nickname/name has been called with the Trainer's voice. (Since the PC has Meta-data that is constantly updated on the trainer and the Pokemon it can easily recognize these speech/vocal patterns). The same thing is happening when you issue a return call. The Pokemon simply gets re-scanned based on the Memory of the Pokeball. The Scanner starts scanning based on the atoms that are entangled in Memory. (since we know their locations at all times)

Moving on lol, PC's are very important because Pokemon are healed there. The way it works is that the whole Pokeball is brought to a very cold temperature, and this is done at a Pokemon center while you are healing your Pokemon. The Pokemon's meta-data is transferred over to a PC and the PokeBall is then essentially recharged. The way a fusion reactor works is that it uses a magnetic field to suspend small atoms of elements and then it fuses them together like what happens in the sun and store the energy of the plasma that is trapped in the magnetic field (very simplistic way of describing it, but it should do). The Pokemon is then treated digitally. If the computers detect Poison for example or fatigue, they can easily rearrange atoms to fix this. After the Pokeball is done recharging, the Pokemon is stored into the computer and the Pokeball is given back to the trainer.

Ending points:

Obviously, many of this is flawed, but a lot of it is physically possible if we can have the right technology. 
But the main thing to take away is that a Pokemon is never actually stored in anyway in its Pokeball. A digital copy is always kept somewhere in a PC. The PC is doing most of the work. The Pokeball doesn't store much information it just carries out steps. ",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_uhgkp,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/uhgkp/the_pokeball/,

It is a gross misconception that they are intended to be the same character in different incarnations. In fact, Red and Ash are brothers. Red is older by a couple of years - so he started his Pokemon journey around the time of the game’s release, and Ash is the younger brother who started his journey around the time of the Anime’s release.
Where Red took down all of Team Rocket, the most influential crime syndicate in his country, Ash has a constant rivalry with two completely inept members of the organization that don't apparently take any part in the real endeavors of Team Rocket.

Red is a Pokemon Master. He defeated the Elite Four, even uncovering a lot of their double standards as Team Rocket members.
Ash has not defeated one league yet.

The reason for Ash’s incompetence is that he has some learning difficulties/mental retardation. However, he looks up to Red completely and is living his life trying to be just like his big brother and idol.

This is why Gary/Green has no interest in Ash whatsoever. He had his fight with Red, and now occasionally meets Ash along his journey, essentially to check up on him.
This is why Brock and Misty, two Gym Leaders, who have an important job to do in their own towns abandoned their posts to travel with Ash. Red had told them about his brother, and they recognized him, and traveled with him to look out for him and keep him relatively out of trouble when Red couldn’t.

Once Red became a Pokemon Master, he went missing. It wasn’t until three years later that he was found up Mt. Silver.
After Red's defeat on Mt. Silver, he sent Pikachu back to Pallet Town to be with Ash. Pikachu didn’t like it, but knew Red was concerned about his brother.
That’s why Pikachu is so wildly overpowered, despite having no obvious training from Ash. Pikachu of course becomes attached to his new ‘trainer’ and wants to protect him.

Essentially, Red paved the whole way for his simple minded brother, becoming a champion along the way. Most, if not all, the other characters that knew both brothers were playing their part to take care of Ash.

Every game has ALSO featured a Fighting-Type specialist, and this type probably holds the most Type-Specific characters throughout the series; Bruno, Chuck and Bruno AGAIN, Brawly, Maylene, and Marshal. So, no doubts they will introduce ANOTHER wrestler or maybe a ninja for a change? Or shall that be Dark-Type?

Dragon-Type! There always has to be a final, super-strong Dragon Tamer! Even though the Dragon-Champions are getting a bit boring now... I bet they'll pump out another one! Unless they make the Champion a Mix-Typed Team!

I think it's time for the first Dark-Type Gym Leader! It has been 4 Generations, and not once has Dark-Type made it into the possible EIGHT gyms of each Region.

Lastly, a Steel-Type Gym or Elite Four is also needing a new appearance, as it has been a little bit of a while... Or maybe a NEW TYPE may make an appearance for a Gym or Elite Four!!!

1355560028.0,21,self.pokemonconspiracies,14vzhe,Genesect: the missing link between the Kabutops evolutionary family and the Scyther evolutionary family.,25,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/14vzhe/genesect_the_missing_link_between_the_kabutops/,"To begin with, Kabuto’s pokedex entry states that “it is thought to have inhabited beaches 300 million years ago” while kabutops’ entries repeatedly state how it was believed to adapt onto land because of its prey. Therefore, we know kabutops is a hunter, a “ferocious, ancient pokemon” that rips its prey apart. Following that, Genesect’s entry states how “over 300 million years ago, it was feared as the strongest of hunters”. So, Genesect was a hunter as well. It is possible that, at some point, Kabutops started evolving (not as in the quick evolution that pokemon usually go through but a gradual evolution) into the pokemon species known as Scyther, and Genesect was merely a species caught in time between this gradual evolution. How are Scyther and Genesect then related? 

Firstly, examine the body shapes of both Scyther and Genesect: a segmented thorax, and an abdomen that supports its legs. More evidence is supported by Genesect’s strong similarity to Scyther’s direct evolution, Scizor. Genesect’s shiny form is a light red, very similar to Scizor’s coloring. Also, the stripes on the abdominal area of both pokemon are similar, as well as both pokemon’s legs. The legs on both are not only segmented, but also feature only one pronged toe on each foot. This may lead to Scizor and Genesect being much similar, but due to Scizor’s steel evolution compared to Genesect’s direct modification, this would not be accurate.

Kabutops and Scyther also share one strong similarity, that being their forearms. Both are long, bladelike weapons, referred to as scythes. Genesect also features on aspect that strongly relates it to Kabutops: its head. Both have strikingly similar head structures, as well as skinny, segmented arms (a trait also shared by Scyther and Scizor). It is possible that kabutops’ pelvic area fused with its telson (its “tail”) to, over time, form the abdominal area featured in Genesect, Scyther, and Scizor.

Now, to address one other concern regarding this theory, that being the pokemon typing. How could a water and rock type slowly become a bug and steel type? To adapt and thrive even further to life on land, Kabutops would have to fully lose its water typing (and therefore helpfully losing its double weakness to grass types) in favor of a type more suitable. The bug type would fall under the phylum arthropoda, as with shellfish (Kabutops are known as the shellfish pokemon), meaning the bug type would be the closest choice. Also, Genesect’s possible typing before being altered by Team Plasma would have been a bug and rock type (as most, if not all fossil pokemon discovered are part rock type). This rock/bug typing of genesect may be the missing link between Kabutops (water/**rock**) and Scyther (**bug**/flying).

The goal is to make the tree to mimic our own tree of life as closely as possible, while incorporating various Pokemon conspiracies to the best of my knowledge. Things that are considered are the organism it is based on, the morphology of the Pokemon itself, and to a lesser extent, the typing. 

There are a few instances where I did not use the final stage of the Pokemon, or multiple stages from the tree of same Pokemon are present. To incorporate Pokemon evolution (p-evolution) with Darwinian evolution, I treat p-evolution kind of like a metamorphosis. Since some of them have very different morphology between stages (Remoraid and Octillery), I treat them as Pokemon different enough to have different evolutionary descendent. 

I did not include any Pokemon that involves trading or friendship to evolve (except for one) because I think they are artificial, and not part of the natural evolution tree. 

It is a text document because I don't like to have a huge-ass image since it's quite an extensive list. I think I have included all the Pokemon family tree from Gen I &amp; II. Any suggestion and correction are welcome. Enjoy :)

In generation two to go with the breeding that was introduced we were given a sudden devolution that seemed to appear out of nowhere. so here is what I think, what if at one point Smoochum didn't actually exist? at least not in Kanto and possibly a few other areas depending. 

Kanto out of the many regions seems to be consistently the farthest behind in technology, despite bill forwarding things for them, they don't have safe routes through caves and even places right beside the cities are overrun with tall grass and don't have proper roads.

as such it is a rather rough living area for both humans and Pokemon. but Pokemon are of course more developed to living in wild areas making sure they are often tough enough to handle the elements especially for their young. so what happens when technology spikes and things become a lot safer and even in the most wild area there is some form of safety, they don't need to have their children born fully developed they are able to have children that can grow properly.

we have seen evidence of odd evolutionary patterns throughout the world, with Eevee being the most obvious, taking power from stones, weather they are an evolutionary stone or if they are merely something to help it attune. we have Magneton which was put through a extreme magnetic area and formed into a more developed streamlined version of itself. both showing that given the chance Pokemon will develop themselves and change their own ""rules"" of evolution to fit into whatever situation they come across

we have seen it with the baby Nidoqueen, a Pokemon that was born fully developed because it wouldn't have been able to survive in the area it was born in without having some form of advantage such as a full form

and we have even seen hints of it in the theories across here, divergent evolutionary patterns, and relations between Pokemon. the possible relationship between  Munna and Drowzee, or even Dunsparce and Yanma more recently. Pokemon will change to fit into their living environment.

TLDR(because I did start to ramble at one point) Pokemon were always born from eggs, but baby Pokemon such as Magby are a recent evolutionary pattern because the world has become a safer place for Pokemon to breed and bring up children in.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,1342727672.0,,,True,t3_wtrxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wtrxj/baby_pokemon_at_one_point_didnt_exist/,

He suggested the idea that humans came from Pokémon, so I did some research. We see from the Sinnoh legends that the world was created by, Arceus, a Pokémon/God. He creates time and space, and goes on to create willpower, knowledge and emotion along with all of their respective pokémon.

 It is Important to note that this is when Mew came into being. Every pokémon in the world after this point carries some of Mew's DNA. To quote its pokédex entry from diamond/pearl: 
&gt;Because it can use all kinds of moves, many scientists believe Mew to be the ancestor of Pokémon.

Now we get the land, sea and ozone layer with their respective pokémon. Regigigas makes the continents. Regigigas ties us back to the Regi-braille story, but that's irrelevant to this post. He's locked away for being crazy. It is worth noting that there was likely an abundance of mews at this stage.

NOW is the period of history on which we will focus. Mews slowly gave way to pre-historic pokémon, of which we occasionally find fossil remains. It is reckoned that in true Darwinian style, humans evolved from pokémon. They are seperate and different and we don't know why people, despite essentially being a type of pokémon themselves, are capable of what they are. Even more astounding about this is that it means that we all have mew's DNA.

As I looked more into Mew, I noticed his Pokedex entry from Silver.
&gt;Its DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so it can use all kinds of techniques.

That's strange. If Pokemon were descendants of Mew, wouldn't all Pokemon contain the genetic code of Mew rather than vice-versa? The semantics seem important in this case.

My theory now, is that Mew is a Pokemon whose DNA structure actually changes with the specication of new Pokemon and is not the ancestor of every non-legendary, whether it is from a point the Pokemon becomes different enough or it is simply poofed into existence by Arceus.

I do prefer Mew as the origin of Pokemon, but I know longer see enough to support it. Thoughts/rebuttals?

**EDIT**: You all have good responses, I figured it's easier to respond to them all at once.
If we start from the presumption that Arceus did create the legendaries (or at least the Sinnoh ones) we know that Mew did not pass down his DNA to all of them. That would mean that the Pokedex entry, the one thing that lead us to believe that mew does in fact contain the genetic codes of all pokemon^1 , is invalid if the only means of mew containing their DNA is by passing it down. This would also apply to a man-made pokemon like Porygon or Golett.

I do maintain that the ordering of the phrase is relevant. A person wouldn't say ""your father has your eyes,"" but would say ""you have your father's eyes."" Mew has their DNA, not the other way around.

And what about happiness evolutions?",25,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/184y1w/if_evolution_is_a_natural_process_for_pokemon_why/,"Pokemon, like all organic life (even though some Pokemon are not organic), are characterized by growth, specialization, and reproduction. One of the biggest elements of growth in the Pokemon world is the phenomenon of evolution, by which a Pokemon takes a form more suitable to its environment and circumstances. This is a much more simplified and rapid form of the same general idea as evolution in the real world. The point is, Pokemon evolve because that's what their environment demands of them. This is especially obvious because many Pokemon evolve naturally over time, as they grow, and take on more powers and more complex shapes and abilities.

So if evolution is driven by the natural environment, how can we have man-made evolutionary items, such as the Metal Coat?

Here's my theory. 

Pokemon are different from animals in our world in about a hundred different ways, but humans are not. The humans depicted in Pokemon follow the same general principles of behavior, technology, government, and societal values as real humans (except for the Pokemon part). Which means that they, like we, have an enormous impact on their environment.

What I mean is, in the real world, there are countless examples of animal species going extinct, becoming endangered, or having their evolution drastically affected because of human behavior. What if, in the Pokemon world, the humans have also affected their environment in such a way that *the environments those Pokemon need to force their evolution no longer exist?*

Let's take Eevee for example. If there were no evolutionary stones (which are man-made objects), then Eevee would not evolve into its three stone-based evolved forms. There doesn't seem to be any other means of doing so. It COULD evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon though, but only in *very specific* environments. This also applies to Pokemon like Nosepass and Magneton. 

So what the hell are evolutionary items, like the stones?

They're an attempt by humans to rectify destroying the environments. If the environment necessary for an Eevee to become a Flareon no longer exists, humans needed to devise a way to keep that evolutionary path open despite that. So the evolutionary stones were crafted in order to preserve the biodiversity and rectify destroying/altering the environment. 

What about things like the Metal Coat, or the Razor Claw/Fang?

These are different. Items that aren't mimicking natural environments have a different purpose, which is to create evolutions that weren't originally there. This makes them sort of the opposite of the evolutionary stones, which preserve evolutions that could naturally exist before. Take Steelix for example. It resembles an Onix with metal grafted to its body through a man-made process. Weavile could very well be a Sneasel with Wolverine-like implants by means of the Razor Claw. In the real world, this is a more-extreme version of what scientists do when they transplant bio-luminescence from bacteria and fish into rats. Essentially, evolutionary items like the Metal Coat and Razor Claw are surgical modifications to pre-existing organisms to increase their strength by unnatural means. 

And what of happiness?

Happiness seems to be very similar to trust. Pokemon are not just animals; they have very human-like emotions and intelligences.

At the end I will explain the many professions of the Pokemon World.

Earth, now in a technological advanced world, has developed a digital world, so that people around the globe may socialize, and for added interest they created creatures of immense power, deemed ""Pocket Monsters"" or ""Pokemon"" for short.

An Earth based organization, presumably Team Rocket, manufactured a virus, and uploaded it into Pokemon World, forbidding anyone who logs in to the game, to escape. (Also touching on the coma theory, but instead of just Ash, its quite a lot of people) 

The reason one may not become a trainer until age 10, is because, mentally, you are in the Pokemon World, which may be unsafe for younger users, but just like everything, some parents do not give a damn about child safety, hence the younger crowd, which also explains why nobody ages, because when you log in, facial recognition scans your appearance, and because you cannot log out you cannot be ""updated"".

As everyone has noticed, many characters in the show survive near or fatal scenarios, this is because, physically you are safe, its all pretend.

Within the world, there are many professions one may take, which I am about to touch up on:

Professor: Nothing more than an instructor for the tutorial program

Evolution takes place over millions of years, but in the Pokemon world, the  time is massively reduced, reason being, like in games they do have levels, and just become recoded, to paraphrase Oak when Ash's Charizard battled Gary's Blastoise ""Only Pokemon of a HIGH LEVEL could cause results like this"".

Breeder: Programmers, with the sole responsibility to ensure users don't receive defective Pokemon

Gym Leaders: Just like in all digitally created things, there must be games, they are hired to  increase amusement, and help players learn.

Trainer / Coordinator: Basic role, an explorer of sorts

Champion: reminiscent of a District Manager for businesses, they maintain specific regions.

Nurse: A debugger of sorts, making sure your Pokemon are not corrupt or crashing.

Elite Four: Assistants to the Champion, dealing with smaller problems, and also adding more fun.

Team Rocket evolves a lake full of Magikarp into Gyarados during the Lake of Rage incident with radio waves. They also want to take over the Radio Tower for similar reasons. The Unown communicate with Radio Waves. When you are in the Ruins of Alph you can tune into the Unown's radio waves. (Incidentally hen you do this your radio resembles an Unown since it's circle shaped with another dot in the center.) Apparently sometimes the the Azure Flute from the Arceus Event can play when you tune into this station. And theres the whole Sinjoh event that connects Unown and Arceus. (To what extent I am not sure.) You can also sometimes hear Ho-oh's cry apparently. There's an NPC who says his brain is picking up radio signals too. I think he's a psychic NPC if that matters. Also music from the radio can affect wild Pokemon that appear, so it really does affect Pokemon. 



The thing is I don't recall reading any conspiracy theory of over-analyzations about any of this even though there is a lot of fuel. 

Maybe radio signals are what some Pokemon use to communicate, specifically Legendary Pokemon or just Arceus? Is it some metaphor for how music can affect your spirit? (Which was pretty apparent in Mother 1, which some game freak guys worked on I think. I need to research the specific details. Mother 1 has a lot to do with music.

As many of you have noticed, the story of teams (rocket, aqua, magma, galactic, etc.) are very linear. The commonly found grunts are very easy to defeat, and you always end up ruining their ultimate goal, forcing them to disband. Or do you?
Every team is present in very key points in the game, like legendary pokemon or large corporations. Also, the bosses of the teams lead you directly to the master balls of each region, even though they could be very useful in their plans. I call this theory ""The Second Team Rocket"" because it seems as if the teams could have a hidden second side to them. The teams usually want to harness the power of legendary pokemon, but their plans always fail. Before that, you have received a masterball, granting you easy access to said pokemon. Other than trading, capturing is the only way to get full information on a pokemon. The teams failed because of lack of information. The second team rocket comes into play here. The teams are generally rivals with similar goals, which create fights that help you progress to a legendary pokemon. And in lg/fr, they are involved with the ruby and sapphire, which allow you to trade with the other gen. III games, thus giving you access to many new rare pokemon. and as I remember, a galactic base also had a secret room with special motors to alter rotom. More information. If they gather enough information that you have collected, they will be able to achieve their goals much more easily.

A bit dark",65,50,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1f98f7/a_weird_thought_regarding_goldsilver_and_crystal/,"I have frequently wondered why it is that in Gold/Silver and HG/SS your mother is always in the kitchen or in the dining room. Never in a bedroom, never sleeps. And no this will not be the sort of ""woman in the kitchen"" joke. Rather, it is this:

Now before I begin, I will remind of an existing theory I read on this sub that Red and Blue take place at the same time as Ruby and Sapphire, and that the Drought/Flood released by Groudon/Kyogre damaged Red. 

Building from that, your mother in Gold/Silver is actually the mother from Red/Blue having a mental breakdown. When she heard the drought/flood damaged her son (I say damaged because some theories say killed, some say rendered him unable to speak, and a few others) she decided to try to get away from all that. I will come back to this point later. 

So she went to New Bark Town. Now given that Gold/Silver takes place about 3 years after Red/Blue (as established within Gold/Silver), your mother had a mental breakdown. She became deluded and thought her son (you) are fine. She sent you to do what she heard Elm needed (and did NOT ask anyone in particular) and built a world around that. She is always in the kitchen cooking thinking her child (you) are coming back at any time. She wants to be there for you, a hot meal prepared.

When you get money in fights and ""send some to mom"" it is really a government check (because let's face it the Pokemon world can afford that and probably has the best health care system possible). And then when she buys things and puts them in your PC it is still her delusion that you would still need it. Any time she heard of anything happening (Rocket takeover, Rocket defeated, someone defeated the champion, magnet train functional again) she always built around the idea it was her son. 

Getting back to what I said about getting away from the trauma, she repressed the thought ""my son is dead"" and thought ""He didn't die, he just came back, left all of his pokemon with Oak for research, and came with me."" The final battle with Red is basically the fight in her mind of reality trying to kick in. There is the ""new"" you and what she wanted you to have become in Johto (and later Kanto) versus what the ""old"" you (Red) really was when he was killed/destroyed by the cataclysm (so to speak) in Ruby/Sapphire.

Now how does this apply with Crystal, especially if you play as the girl? That can be either explained by the brain damage from the trauma, or perhaps with the girl representing other things the original red COULD have been but wasn't.

1361396342.0,20,self.pokemonconspiracies,18wsu4,[repost] The transform-state theory,22,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/18wsu4/repost_the_transformstate_theory/,"Well, let's resume a few points:

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Mimic, Mirror Move, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

2. Let's assume Ditto is a failed Mew clone, or at least related to it, like being a breed of some sorts

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3hXmr3wZT0&amp;t=0m27s), you can see that when a pokémon is evolving, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So, this teory is very simple and it explains a lot of things, first:

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew, but two Mew which transformed into couples of pokémon.
2. The other pokémon, being Mew's offspring, retain part of the ability to transform, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process
3. When a pokémon evolves, it is transforming into another, and the limits of the transformation, however, are defined by the species
4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, and that same state can be used to be stored into special computers, also explaining why pokémon like Conkeldurr can get its pillars inside a pokéball: he gets them into the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve, such as in Machop, Prinplup and Tyrogue's cases
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, such as Beldum and Magnemite, don't do that when they are with trainers. They do that when they are on the wild. The *transform state*'s properties allow them to ""duplicate"" themselves after having enough experience points. When they don't have enough experience points they can perform an evolution by merging, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points, a pokémon gets unstable and volatile, being able to tap into its Mew-like powers to get into the transform-state and transform into the next evolutionary stage of its species.
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, in the transform-state, a portion of its experience points are consumed in order to keep that 'form', and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

(the videos are all supposed to start in the precisely right second I'm talking about)

Has anybody else seen it?,28,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1836h7/a_strange_pokemon_hack_i_once_found_has_anybody/,"I thought that this might be a good place to post, since everybody here loves the creepier Pokemon hacks floating about the internet.  Please, take heed that this isn't a creepypasta.  I'm not trying to pretend that I once had my hands on the infamous Pokemon Black hack or any such haunted game.  What I had was made by somebody with know-how though, and a creepy imagination.      
     
About five or six years ago, I purchased a bundle of Gameboy games on eBay with the hopes of scoring Trip World or Spud's Adventure or something I'd never seen before.  Although the deal was only for 30 random games, the package I got had more than twice that inside.  Mostly junk, more doubles than not, half of them were some form or another of Tetris. Boring.  Before I gave up hope, I started to test the cartridges that didn't have stickers, one of which was labeled Pokemon in sharpie.  It was a grey cartridge, so I knew it had to be an import of Pokemon Red or Green or a homebrew that somebody saved to a ROM cartridge.  And homebrew it was, skipping the normal opening screen and starting directly from the New Game screen.  I chose New Game, hoping to figure out which version I had.  Instead of the normal sequence of events, I found myself in front of the the tall grass in Pallet Town.  I never named my character or chose a starter, but I could walk around.  I couldn't talk to anybody, or use start or select or do much of anything besides move around.  When I finally triggered a battle with a trainer, the game froze.  The trainer's ! came up and he walked over, but didn't say anything and the battle never started.  There was nothing you could do but turn it off at that point.  The game became moving so as to avoid the trainers, and since I could never save or check my start screen, I had to start over from the beginning each time.  We called it Pokemon Grey.  Sometimes they only responded if you were right in front of them, and some of them blocked paths that I could never take.  At a few points in the game, mostly where there were trees to cut or surf was needed to progress, the start screen did come up automatically.  I could save, I had an Abra with teleport, and if I chose Teleport, it automatically teleported to the Pokemon Center in the next ""level"" of the game.  The character's name was blank (I think it was ------- or ***** or a string of spaces).  He had no money, and his Pokedex had only one entry (the Abra).  I don't have anyway of connecting it to my computer or demoing it live, and it had problems booting up on Game Boy Player and Game Boy Advance.  It still works, or it did the last time I started it up.  Has anybody else seen this ROM?  Or know its official name?  I never figured out what the ending is supposed to be.  I made it to Cinnabar Island, but never found the specific tile that brought up the menu.  Anybody know of any catalog of hacked Pokemon versions?  I want to try playing again and see if I can figure out how to win.      
    
Also forgot to mention, not sure if it's important or not, but if you saved at any point, you couldn't get the menu back to teleport.  So it took a looong time to get to Cinnabar Island, like 3 hours of play if you knew which ways to go.

1358550922.0,19,self.pokemonconspiracies,16ugc6,Legendary Trios and Locations Significance,22,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16ugc6/legendary_trios_and_locations_significance/,"So I was thinking about legendaries still (over a week on one topic is probably a record for me or something), and I was trying to figure out a reason for why legendaries are where they are in the Pokemon world. We'll use the following maps for reference: 

http://nintendoland.com/upload/Pokemon_World_Map_by_Cadellin.png
http://www.ksky.ne.jp/~kumagai/MapEnglish/JapanMap.jpg
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/japan_rel96.jpg

Now, looking back to Gen 1, we had the three birds in different locations, each specific to it. With Moltres, it is situated in Victory Road. I had the theory about the Pokemon War with the birds staying in strategic military locations for Man. Looking on the Japanese map, Moltres would be in, or close to, the Southern Japanese Alps, a very high mountain range. This range could also block, in theory, one region from accessing another (hence why Johto was ""discovered"" later). This gives Man a natural barrier, perfect for ambushes, or a base. 

Side note: Johto wasn't ""dicsovered"" till years after, because of the bullet train technology developing in Japan. It took off, so to speak, around 1998, the year before G/S came out. This is why the train is in Gen 2, linking the regions, due to the mountain range.

Back on topic: Articuno is in the Seafoam Islands, important in a possible naval base. In the Japanese map, the Seafoam Islands would be just off the coast, not a huge deal, but enough for maybe a small operation. Zapdos, chilling in the Power plant, is off by the coast of Japan. Easy access to the water, for power. Zapdos remains there so Man can't regain the power it had during the war. That's why the train doesn't ""happen"" till Gen 2: Red captures Zapdos, giving Kanto back its power.

Gen 2: Funny, the placement of the dogs is a theory in itself I've mentioned before. Ecruteak is more or less where current Kyoto is, famous for padogoas. The dogs were there during the war as well. They originally were Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, come to pray to Arceus in the Burned Tower to end the war between Pokemon and Man. Ho-oh, attacking something nearby, missed, and burned the tower and the Pokemon to the ground. Seeing the mistake, Ho-oh rebirths them with superior forms of the elements they represented. The dogs wait though, for a trainer worthy to awake them to roam the world. That's why they're running all over Johto: they haven't seen the world, because they don't have memories of it.

Gen 3: The Regis/The ""Elementals"", as I call them. Rayquaza is simple: highest place in Hoenn, is looking out for any weather disturbances in the world. Geographically, it's a small island in the East China Sea....yeah, I have no clue what to make of that :P Kyogre is in a trench, near the Osumi-Shoto island chain. That chain is near one of the deepest parts of the world; makes sense to send the sleeping ocean god down there. Groudon sleeps under Oita (or near it), a modern city.....only significance I see is a oil-based city...not a good combo with the sleeping continent creator :P

As for the Regis, it's tough. It really is. None of them are in ""prime"" locations for any significance; they're mainly between cites/main roads, or on an island by itself (Regice). I could do more of the legendaries, but even though I've played in the Sinnoh region, I don't have a full grasp on the lake trio yet. They're tricky buggers :P

TL;DR: Moltres is on Victory Road, which could be the Southern Japanese Alps (high mountain range, which explains why Johto wasn't discovered till after the bullet train technology took off in Japan(which was in 1998)). Articuno is in the Seafoam Islands, which could be a military ""base"" (if going off the Pokemon War theory). Zapdos is in the Power Plant, near the coast of Japan, using the ocean for power. The reason why the bullet train in Gen 2 works is because Red captured Zapdos, giving Kanto the power back. In Gen 2, the dogs were Eeveelutions, killed by Ho-oh by accident, then given superior forms of themselves. They run around Johto, because they have no memories of their past life. In Gen 3, the Regi trio has no major significance, while Groudon is under a city, Kyogre is near a deep ocean trench, and Rayquaza is out watching from an island for any weather anomalies.",Legendaries,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,reserved4,,True,t3_16ugc6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16ugc6/legendary_trios_and_locations_significance/,

But why wont a simple phone call suffice? Obviously he is there for other purposes.

In Pokemon Black and White, the Prof had to reintroduce herself officially although Bianca Cheren and Black knew her their whole lives. 

In Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Prof Rowan reintroduced himself officially although he already made acquaintance with Barry and Diamond.

Now flash back to Professor Oak. He never had an official speech when he sent Red on his journey. 

In Pokemon Gold, Prof Elm said something along the lines of introducing himself.

It is therefore, my theory, that Prof Oak went to the Elite 4 to discuss matters pertaining to these:

In order to have more manpower to gather research material, Prof Oak has proposed to the Elite 4 to streamline the entire pokemon journey with protocols, rules etc. 

Note: Red has known Oak for his whole life, while other protagonists may be acquaintances/never met their Profs. 

After R/B/Y/G/S/C, the Profs has explicitly stated that the captured Pokemon were for research purposes, while R/B/Y/G/S/C profs merely stated their starters were 'experimental'. This has shown that the journey process has been streamlined into an official law/rule/etc, with Professors saying what is required, Aides along the way to help the main characters with their journeys, Gym leaders pointing the way to the next gym etc.

And, in order for the young men and women to be able to successfully protect themselves, Prof Oak has proposed a select breed of starters. Hence, Prof Oak labeled the R/B/Y starters as his own, since his plan has not started at the time. 

In Pokemon Gold, the starters program has just been begun, or still in development stage, hence Elm's stance of maintaining that Gold/Silver starters were experimental.

Later starters were stronger and more suited for traveling (double typings, pokemon with movepools that support terrain traversing and moves that support easier pokemon capture etc) reflect this plan's fruition.

Their pawns also collect money to fund this secret team, build an elite pokemon team to add to their armed forces including powerful legendaries (we never see what happens at the end of the games so maybe they are forcibly taken), collect data about the regions geography location and pokemon types and also weaken the gym leaders who would serve as resistance to this teams plans in the event of an attack.

it got me thinking about the three Pokemon lake guardians of sinnoh uxie, mespirit, and azelf in the same way so here is  an explanation of my theory of the three sprites.


first we cover the structure

Id:the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends

Ego:the organized, realistic part

Super Ego:plays the critical and moralizing role

these are the three parts of the theoretical Freudian psyche structure and represent the human mind


the three Pokemon  can be split into these three as well

Mespirit of emotions is the uncoordinated and instinctual part of the structure, basing any decisions on what feels right for it and just letting things happen

Uxie of knowledge is the organized and realistic Pokemon based off of the part of the mind that thinks through everything and takes time to make a decision

finally Azelf of valor is the Super ego, the moralizing part of the mind that is goal oriented and will continue to push forward regardless of what it faces.


so the three guardians of the lake are the three parts of the fruedian though structure made real. Though this may not have been the original intention and may not even be what it is based off of, it is surprising how well they match up(or at least *puts on sunglasses* in my mind YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH)",,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,t3_wfcbo,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/wfcbo/the_lake_guardians_of_freud/,

[xpost from fantheories]",25,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/vofje/a_timeline_that_connects_mother_evangelion_and/,"Evangelion, Mother and Pokemon all occur in the same line. Mother and Evangelion happen in the same timeline or universe because the Mach Pizza restaurant from Earthbound has a cameo in Neon Genesis Evangelion Episode 12 at the 2 minute mark. There's an advertisement that has the words 'Mach Pizza' and the same Logo. Mother 2 happens sometime in the 90s, and the Evangelion TV series takes place in 2014. The second impact took place in 2000. That leaves enough room for the events of Mother 1 and 2 to happen before Evangelion.

At the End of Evangelion, the people who rejected instrumentality built a White Ship and flew to Nowhere Islands. The events of Mother 3 take place. There's a lot of weird connections that could be a coincidence, but for the sake of this theory I'll say they are intentional. I put them all on my blog awhile ago. 

http://flintsdoorknob.blogspot.ca/2012/01/mother-3-and-evangelion-connections-and.html

The legends of the dragons Zekrom and Reshiram were derived from the events of Mother 3. Although it was not literally what happened, it was only a legend. The two twins in that legend came from the idea of Lucas and Claus, and the race to pull the needles to free the dragon. After the end of Mother 3 the dragon recreated the Evangelion and Mother universe into the Pokemon universe. There are a lot of similarities between Mother and Pokemon that I have already listed before, so I'll just give the biggest example. Mewtwo is based on Giegue from Mother 1, and Genesect is based on Unit-01 and 02 from Evangelion. 

All three franchises started with an alien falling to earth from space or something involving a meteorite. In Evangelion it was the First Impact. In Mother 2 it was Giegue and BuzzBuzz' arriving from a meteor. Pokemon arrived to Earth from a meteorite. They're all about kids growing up and fighting alien monsters.

(Not that serious of a theory, I just like theories that connect universe but I was never heavily obsessed with a few franchises that I could connet before!)

But what if the war is still going on? All the young men still fighting sounds more plausible then all of them dying, hence the lack thereof in game. (This theory mainly pertains to Kanto)

Now this theory can easily put to rest by Lt. Surge, who talks about the war like it's already happened because he survived it. But what if he was just injured to the point that he could no longer fight and he had to leave? If the war is still going on, then that explains a lot in the Kanto Region. Criminal organizations, such as Team Rocket and the bikers, are able to run rampant in the streets with no real government intervention. That's because they are to busy dealing with the war, and because they aren't doing anything too major it's not a priority at the moment. It explains the gym system and why children are able to leave home by themselves at such a young age. The men that are able to fight are absent from the game, like Red's dad, because they are still fighting in the war. But they are not enough, and some are getting hurt and have to be withdrawn like Lt. Surge possibly was. More manpower is necessary in order for them to stand a chance in the war. They also have to leave enough people to keep the Kanto economy and society alive, so children become a possible option. This is why they are given a Pokemon at  a young age and they are allowed to go out into the world on their own. And the pokedex given to you by Oak is a way to obtain data on Pokemon that you would using or fighting against in the war. However, they are still children and are not combat ready, which is why gyms and the elite four was established. They act as army training camps. If the child is able overcome the 8 gyms and and the elite four they are deemed battle ready. This may also explain why there is no champion before Gary. After you defeat Lance he says that you would be champion, if it wasn't for your rival already beating him before you got there. 

As for regions such as Johto and Sinnoh, which take place 3 years after Kanto and Hoenn, they adopted the gym challenge and the Elite Four. They do this to make sure that if there is ever another war, they won't be short on manpower, or have to wait for children to complete their journeys. This is the purpose of the Hall of Fame. It records you and your Pokemon once you defeat the Elite Four. By recording your team, they are able to see how you train Pokemon, which types you would have a good knowledge of, and where you would be best fit in a war situation. If a war ever breaks out again, they only have to look at the Hall of Fame and then contact you.

The leaders are also some of the most respected members of the pokémon world. Many of them are idolised, with Brock being the most obvious example. They are the most senior figures of the Community. 

In towns without a gym, there is usually still a senior figure of the Community. Oak in Pallet, Mr. Fuji in Lavender. These are not cities, and so don't need the same level of attention. 

The Elite Four would share between them the responsibilities of regional government. They often appoint gym leaders, and help out when there is a crisis. Lance helped to take down Team Rocket, Lorelei went to protect her town from Team Rocket, and Steven or Wallace dealt with Kyogre and/or Groudon depending on which game it was.

Awful weird. I hope this'll offer an explanation for it.

So in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity we learned that the Pokemon-inhabited world has a Voice of Life, and that multiple worlds have Voices of Life. A Voice of Life is sort of sentient manifestation of the will of all life on Voice's planet, and can see into the future kind of. Notably in Gates the Voice appealed to other worlds for help to try and avert the end of all life.

My theory is that the Voice of Life in the world of the main games has a slightly different way of dealing with planetary crises. 

When it detects one or a group of it's members who pose a threat to the majority of of it's contituents, it creates a sort of antibody in the form of a hero. Common traits of this hero include a love and understanding of Pokemon, proficiency in battling, rivals, nice hats and being 10-15ish years of age. It's possible that the Voice can only see as far ahead as the current state of it's life forms will take it. When Cyrus caught wind of a way to reset the planet, the Voice began preparing Dawn/Lucas as a countermeasure against him, making use of others like Professor Rowan, Cynthia, and Barry to give her/him the guidance and motivation to fulfill her/his destiny. The same principle applies to all other Pokemon protagonists so far, and the similarities between each character could just be the Voice doing what it knows works. Small towns, ambitions for the Championship, absent dads. It's just how you put a world-saving hero together.

I said in a comment on my first theory that Mew has certain points where it creates Dittos.  Spawn-points, if you will.  It is at certain spawn-points that you can find wild Ditto.  However, there are others that Mew chose as places of special energy, and the Pokemon found there sometimes reflect this.  A spawn-point near an abandoned ruin creates Ghost Pokemon.  On a snow-capped mountain, Ice Pokemon.  In a cave of strong magnetism, Electric and Rock Pokemon.  In a forest, Grass Pokemon.

In Mt. Coronet and Chargestone Cave, almost every rock is magnetically charged.  If you bring in a Magneton or a Nosepass, they evolve.  This is because the magnetic energy supercharges the inner Ditto, much like the Trading Machine (see Part IV).

When you take Eevee to a certain rock, it will evolve based on which rock, Leafeon for the Moss Rock, Glaceon for the Ice Rock.  This is because while in most areas, Mew's specific spawn-point is secret and hidden, in these areas, the specific point is accessible by humans.  At this point where Mew creates Dittos, Eevee, already a special case of evolution and transformation, taps into the combination of local and Mew-based energy to evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon.

**TL;DR:  Where Mew spawns Dittos is important, and in certain areas, certain Pokemon can tap into the energy involved in Ditto-creation and evolve.**",Ditto,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,reserved3,,True,t3_16ipkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16ipkf/ditto_theory_part_v_areaspecific_evolution/,
1357623716.0,16,self.pokemonconspiracies,166379,"The Pokemon Regions as a massive, for-profit area for the professional sport of Pokemon Battling (x-post from Fan Theories)",22,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/166379/the_pokemon_regions_as_a_massive_forprofit_area/,"I believe that the Pokemon regions do not make up the entirety of the Pokemon world. Pokemon battling is something like a professional sport in this world, and the Pokemon regions are places people travel to participate.

How does this work? Well, you pay a fee to participate in the Pokemon League Challenge. This fee covers Pokemon Centers, Marts, Gyms, and that sort of thing. For younger participants, they can be accompanied by a parent; their parent can pay to stay in a house on-site (hence your mother living in Pallet Town/wherever, but also many of the people living everywhere else). Everybody else in these regions is either another participant in the League/one of their companions, an employee of the League (gym trainers, nurses, mart employees, move tutors, etc.), other people involved in Pokemon (professors, the people who run the Safari Zone), or criminals (Team Rocket).

This explains why there are no roads or cars, and why towns are so small; it's made for people to traverse by foot, giving them plenty of opportunities to catch wild Pokemon. Of course this world has cars, and infrastructure, but there's no need for it here. Why else would there be a space shuttle, but not so much as a golf-cart anywhere else? (okay other than the truck at the S.S. Anne) It also explains why the Orre region has no wild Pokemon; most places that do not have an official Pokemon League do not have as much of a presence of Pokemon. These places are chosen and mapped out very carefully to include a series of different environments. Consider the cameraman/interviewer trainers in Ruby/Sapphire. They explain that they are there to watch up-and-coming trainers. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to be right outside of gyms or something? Well, not if the entire region is specifically for the purpose of battling.
Think about it. Do you really think every single person would care about battling/raising Pokemon the way the people in each region seem to, or would there be at least SOME population of people who really just don't care about your wacky battling pets?

So why are the various Teams there? For different reasons in each generation. Team Rocket, because the Pokemon Leagues pull in a lot of money. Everywhere you find them, they're involved in some kind of racket for cash, whether it's petty theft or trying to steal incredible technology from Silph Co., no doubt to sell to the highest bidder. Team Aqua/Magma, for the publicity. It seems like they could pick anywhere in the world to carry out their ecoterrorism, but they picked the Pokemon League, a place that undoubtedly has at least one channel on TV dedicated to it. A disturbance there would certainly bring national attention to their cause. Team Galactic's motives are made pretty clear. Finally, Team Plasma targets the Pokemon League as the manifestation of everything it is against: making Pokemon fight for spectacle and sport.

How are the people in these Leagues supported, then? If you don't have a job, or any place to stay, how do you stay fed and clothed? That goes back to the fee earlier. At least once in the show, Ash/Misty/Brock are depicted sleeping on couches in the Pokemon Center. Otherwise, they are shown camping, which leads me to believe that entering a Pokemon League Challenge requires some sort of aptitude test to make sure the people involved aren't going to mess this up royally. Think about the trainers you run into that are exceptionally young. The ones that seem too young to be embarking on this kind of challenge on their own are always close to the early towns; maybe their older sibling is elsewhere, and they're staying in one of those places with their parents. The other young trainers seem to be the Pokemon equivalents of the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts, people that have at least SOME kind of experience camping/living off of their wits.

I think the real target market for these leagues are the CoolTrainers, though. They seem like people who are approximately college-age, and I have a few theories about them. Since they always seem stylish and badass, I think maybe they're like the professional athletes of Pokemon battling. While they're not on any sort of real team, they are competing for glory to fight the Elite Four, and there's no reason they can't have been sponsored. Companies that make camping equipment, Pokemon battling stuff (balls, potions, etc.), and even clothing could sponsor them.

So maybe you're in High School on summer break, and you've saved up for a year or two to enter this. You practiced every weekend for the aptitude test, and finally, your mom agreed to come with you while your dad stayed home to work. You sign up pretty late, and the only on-site housing left is not in the most accessible or exciting place in the world, but the house next door is occupied by somebody you know, so at least there's that. Plus, you'll finally get to see your old family friend Professor Oak again; he's been employed by the Pokemon League for a while to study Pokemon in his lab. He's got your phone number in case you need anything, and the same goes for your mom. What better way to spend your summer vacation?

Any trainer can store a few hundred pokemon in a PC network connected to all other PCs in and around the region. Bulbapedia states that the pokemon are stored and transmitted as computer data. 

You'd have hundreds, maybe thousands of trainers with their own personal storage space for their pokemon, meaning you have got to have massive servers, regularly maintained at all times, to ensure that all trainers have access to their pokemon and their boxes 24/7. 

Also, that any pokemon caught in the field, and well over a trainer's 6-pokemon-limit, would be automatically sent to the trainer's PC. 

What if that wasn't really the case? What if that was how they explained it just so the common John or Jane would understand how it works?

What if let's say there is such technology as teleportation, and you'd have people working in huge warehouses storing everyone's pokemon and/or pokeballs? I mean, the theory of teleportation isn't as farfetched in the pokemon world as it is in the real world, and quite a few pokemon actually have the ability to teleport at will (Abra, for example).

I believe that the legendary pokemon are like the Greek Gods, this is a long shot right now, but stay with me please. Arceus represents Kaos.(Parent of Gaia, Night, and Tartarus.) Mew represents the Gaia and Ouranos, the parents of the Titans. Ho-oh and Lugia represent the Titans to me. They give birth to the Gods. The Gods would be just about every other legendary pokemon. The 3 main legendaries of each reigon, represent the ""big three"" Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. It is recurring! Zapdos, Raikou, Rayquaza, Giratina, and Kyurem are Zeus. Moltres, Entei, Groudon, Dialga, and Zekrom are Hades. Articuno, Suicone, Kyogre, Palkia, and Reshiram are Poseidon. (The 5th gen are kind of a stretch) But you see, those are the 3 main 'Gods' The weaker legendaries, such as Heatran and the Regi golems are the less known Gods like Morpheus (the sleep god) Next up, the demi-gods. These are the Pseudo-legendaries! Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamance, Metagross, Garchomp, and Hydreigon. Not much else to say about them. These Demi-gods mated and made all of the pokemon we know today.
We also know that these powerful beings (Gods and Titans) could reproduce both sexually and asexually. This would explain how more 'Gods' came about, and how they have continued to exist. When the gods grow old and weak, they die. But like a phoenix, they are born from their old remnants. Fire pokemon, ashes. Electric, they come back when lightning strikes the 'earth' next. Dark, from the darkest shadows, ETC.
Since all pokemon came from a Godly beginning, they all have retained at least one similarity, the immortality of the 'Gods'
Mewtwo was the attempt to make a normal pokemon, into a God. When the God pokemon was created, he was contacted by the other God's and told to destroy all research, he did so and took his place with the other legendaries.

 It is here that another theory can be made. Perhaps pokémon are personifications of various aspects of the world. For instance, Entei personifies fire as a substance. If fire were to come to life, it would become Entei. Perhaps pokémon are a medium through which we can understand and be closer to various aspects of this world. The dark pokémon represent the night. When we think of the night, we think of many different things, all of which are personified by different pokémon. We think of fear, nightmares and various horrors, all of which are embodied by Darkrai. However, the night is also beautiful. It is starry and magical.

It hasnt been officially announced, but other than gen 1, they've always had eeveelutions be released in pairs, and the last time they added a new type, it was stronger than the old typed eeveelution. Fairy type is confirmed super effective against Dragons, so does this mean a possible Dragon Eevee?
