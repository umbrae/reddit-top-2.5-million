Online and in Atlanta!",2071,461,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1geyi0/with_cnn_ignoring_the_prism_scandal_i_had_to/,"First, i'd like to apologize if anyone thinks this distracts from the cause, but I think it fits perfectly, and allows us to even do a bit of ""hacktivism"" for those who have said they wont be able to make it out to rallys.

CNN is owned by Time Warner, who owns Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable (along with Comcast) enjoy local monopolies for cable TV and Internet all over the US. Both have also been outed as not paying their fair share in taxes for a very long time. The first people I would approach if starting a data collection program, would be these two.

Why does this matter so much? Well, to me, this is the very fabric of the issue here. A governent that decides it will stretch the meaning of the law to illegally obtain info on all Americans. A company who abides by it, and never mentions concern for its users' privacy. Then, that very same company, uses it's news division to shut down the story alltogether. I think it's time we get CNN talking about this again. 

* Live Shots on CNN with posters &amp; protesters where possible.

* Trending on Twitter with thousands of @CNN mentions including questions about their possible involvement, and if that's why they are avoiding the subject.
 
* Anything else you can think of. The options are really limitless.

This could bring a massive amount of attention to our cause. Not only to the people who watch CNN, but also on Twitter and Facebook as they see the pictures and message posted all over.

What do you guys think?

**edit:** There are some upvotes here, so that's a start. If you want to get involved, please use your (or make a new) twitter account, and tweet @CNN as much as possible. This is most effective in high numbers. The key is to make it to where every time someone does a search for CNN, we are there. If you feel that this is good for #RestoreThe4th, be sure to include that too w/ lots of information on how more can join our movement. This movement can not be allowed to stall, and by taking to social media strong, we will have more people coming here to check things out! 

**edit 2:** There are already a good amount of tweets going, but just so you dont fall into the same problem I did, be careful on the amount of times you tweet the same thing ""@"" people. Twitter will suspend the account and you have to verify you're human. Please get on board this if you're just at home today. This could be really big with more tweets out there! 

**------ PLEASE READ ------**

**edit 3** /u/lolsociety Mentioned that they are concidered 2 seperate companies, and while that seperation may be up for debate, I think it might be best to force CNN to talk about our movement in general. Ask for the stories you want to hear when it comes to Snowden / PRISM, and link to other journalists that are doing better work. Most importantly though, mentions of **#RestoreThe4th** (which we need a GREAT deal more of on twitter). Any additional ideas you have please mention them, or even PM me.

African American's did it to raise awareness on civil rights issues and it was a huge success. How hard can it be to organize a fraction of a percentage of the people in this country into a voice that can't be quieted? Hong Kong, Brazil, Egypt. If they can bring change to their government, we can bring change to ours.

Edit: Didn't expect this to get so big. I need 5 Twitter names to follow to start this account. I'm not looking to promote any other ideas or politicians in any form. I've already started a GMail account and I'll work a FB account. /u/Hail_the_IT-Goddess has offered to help and I will probably need a  couple more. There was a gender issue brought up so I changed the name to Million Citizen March. On Twitter it's @MCMonDC And GMail: MCMonDC@GMail.com


Edit2: I've been reading a lot of the messages and thank you again for the support. I am in agreement that if you can't make it to DC, a march on your state capital is just as good. I also thought that people in each state that can't make it should organize under #MCMon(State Capital). And you're right, we're going to need keynote speakers to help endorse the movement. I don't want this to be a Guy Fawkes mask type of event either. We are citizens of the US and we have no reason to hide our faces. More importantly, I wish to stay as far away from groups that can discredit ours. If you have any suggestions let me know. Until then, follow me @MCMonDC and let's try and get this to the front page. 


Edit3: Date will be important. If we want a million people it has to be after everyone returns from summer vacations. I've thought about it long and hard, September 11 is Patriot Day. It's not a federal holiday, but it seems like the easiest one the average person could get off to attend a rally. Also, I think the day itself and what it stands for and what we stand for will have a big impact as well. Hopefully using that in conjunction with the movement will get enough people out and on to the streets to make a difference. What do you guys think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us not just show up, let us be effective. We must protest like a peaceful army.
Wear your Sunday best - this is bigger than a job interview, this is our democratic republic at stake. 

The time to debate with those who fail to recognize the danger these programs represent is over. We must seek out our allies in this battle and unite. Those who oppose our cause have the option to march as well, and make demands for more intrusion. But we know they won't. So why waste our time arguing with mad men? 

This is not a rehearsal. It's not a game. We must not commit the mistakes of other well intentioned movements. When we march, we march with a clear, single minded goal; and that is to restore the right of a free people to be safe in their papers and effects.

Now is not the time to cast blame on those who may have been mislead, or those who couldn't be bothered to see the system for what it is. On the contrary. Now is the time to embrace them and celebrate their awakening. We need their help, and they need ours.

Now is not the time to promote one candidate over another, or a party, or an ideology. It is time to unify our house and stand as one. 

Do not promote fear among your ranks. Not even in jest. No jokes about Big Brother watching, or the admission onto watch lists, or Gitmo. Do not let yourselves become unwitting instruments of this machine.

Let's set a ~~Kickstarter~~ Indiegogo and buy this ad. Our neighbors don't all make use of Reddit. Let's do this as if it were our only chance.

**EDIT**: An ad in the Times will run us $50k. That's peanuts. If this community can raise nearly a million dollars for a bus driver, it can manage this.

EDIT 2: u/davros_ brought it to my attention that this funding is allowed on **Indiegogo.com**, but not on Kickstarter, as it's not an art project. So Indiegogo it is.

International contributions can be made through Indiegogo. We welcome the support of our friends from across the globe. You're being indiscriminately spied on as well. 

**EDIT 3:** I am currently setting up the link. It will be up shortly and you'll find it right below this edit.

I need someone with graphic skills to set up a logo we can use.

**Edit 4** Someone else will need to set up the Indiegogo. I'm unable to do so through my phone. 
Someone set it up and I will post the link here.

EDIT: TL;DR:

&gt; ""While not currently permitted under U.S. law, there are increasing calls for creating a more permissive environment for active network defense that allows companies not only to stabilize a situation but to take further steps, including actively retrieving stolen information, altering it within the intruder’s networks, or even destroying the information within an unauthorized network. Additional measures go further, including **photographing the hacker using his own system’s camera, implanting malware in the hacker’s network, or even physically disabling or destroying the hacker’s own computer or network.** ""

&gt; Additionally, software can be written that will allow only authorized users to open files containing valuable information. If an unauthorized person accesses the information, a range of actions might then occur. For example, the file could be rendered inaccessible and **the unauthorized user’s computer could be locked down, with instructions on how to contact law enforcement to get the password needed to unlock the account.**

The definition of the word ""hacker"" covers IP theft, which includes those who share music, movies, etc. (Search for ""hacker"" in the article)

The list includes congressional members' names, party, chamber (house or senate), and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy, and a low intrusion score means they have done less damage (or acted to protect our privacy).

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn), other data I assembled myself.  If you see an error (and there will be errors) let me know or correct it yourself if possible.

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab, which contains all of the data.

**Key**:  This is the second tab, which explains the column headings in the master list.

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the Holt ['Repeal the Surveillance State Act'](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2818#overview) is sitting in committee.  I have ranked the House Judiciary Committee (rougly) by the priority with which they should be contacted, and included my reasoning and their DC office numbers.  The higher the name on the list (ideally), the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What To Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above, and I've also copied the names and numbers below.

When you dial the number, you'll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes.  Wasting your breath with long-winded discussion helps no one.  Keep it as clear and simple as possible, and be kind to the person you're talking to; they control whether your message goes up the chain.

""Hi, I'm calling to ask representative X to support Rep. Holt's 'repeal the surveillance state act, HR 2818.  I'm very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore.  Please pass my message along to the representative.""

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, don't provide it.  

If you are a constituent, make sure they get your zip code.  

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, say, ""I'm calling Rep. [X] in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again, keep it brief.  Ask them to support Holt's 'Repeal the Surveillance State Act, HR 2818'.



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, you are (doubling, tripling, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation, how to talk to interns (as I explained to you above), then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to 100% success.

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, claim it's your brilliant idea, or link people directly to this post.  Change it however you want.  Just share this information (Facebook, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/nsa_amash/

Nathan White just made us aware of some huge news. Rep. Amash has put forward an amendment that would defund the NSA's surveillance program. The vote is set for wednesday. From the House Committee's website:

""Ends authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act. Bars the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act to collect records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who are not subject to an investigation under Section 215.""

Guys, it's tim for our biggest push yet. It needs to be on par with SOPA/PIPA. Tell everyone you know, post on every internet soapbox you have about this upcoming vote. Nag your friends, family, and enemies. Encourage everyone to call their representatives. It's exciting to think that we could finally put an end to the NSA's spying. But as Nathan said, it's more than that. If we don't get a good showing on this vote, it will make it a lot harder to get congress to take us seriously in the future. 

Remember, this is what we've all been working so hard for. It should be #1 priority!

There's another interesting recent development: the [President is set to meet with the long lost *Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board*](http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/06/obama-to-meet-friday-with-privacy-and-civil-liberties-166740.html).  Never heard of it?  You're not alone.  Established in 2004, it was basically ignored through the Bush, and most of the Obama, years, with nominations finally being confirmed in 2012.  Sure, it's probably a dog and pony show, but [a handful of Senators are calling for the PCLOB to push Obama on PRISM and related issues](http://www.scribd.com/doc/147446726/2013-Letter-to-Privacy-and-Civil-Liberties-Oversight-Board). And while I don't know much about most of the board members, [Jim Dempsey](https://www.cdt.org/personnel/jim-dempsey) is at least one good pick.

So I'm seeing two pressure points to get members of Congress working on this issue. 1) Shiff/Rokita bill and 2) coordinating with the PCLOB.  These are obviously not enough, nothing short of full repeal of the USA PATRIOT will do, IMHO, but we aren't going to arrive there next week.  It's going to take chipping away and public awareness.

And to that point, I was fortunate to be able to talk to my Representative over the weekend in a crowded coffee shop.  The crowd of mostly elderly folks cheered the loudest for questions asked about health care and restoring the 4th Amendment.  Seriously, old folks are not pleased about this subject.  The problem is not enough are aware, and we have to be involved in changing that.

Trying to keep it fairly brief, though I have much more I could rant about.  Please keep up the hard work.

[EDIT]

I also just found out about [another great bill from Adam Schiff which aims to end the blanket approval for the Executive branch to do whatever the fuck it wants, also known as the ""Authorization for Use of Military Force.""](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2324?utm_campaign=govtrack_feed&amp;utm_source=govtrack/feed&amp;utm_medium=rss)  This act made way for USA PATRIOT, and has been the ""legal"" basis (in quotes because I think we've abused the notion of legality to the point where ""rule of law"" is meaningless) of the majority of post-911 actions.  It's pretty naive to think this will move out of committee in this Congress, but repealing this act--even getting the discussion started in the mainstream--would be HUGE.  We have to be prepared to act on all available fronts, which means using the establishment channels when the opportunities exist.  Seriously, I'm begging, call/write your elected officials, spread the word to friends &amp; family.

1371140706.0,705,self.restorethefourth,1g9xyg,A guide to the arguments against NSA surveillance,799,94,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g9xyg/a_guide_to_the_arguments_against_nsa_surveillance/,"It may be useful for everyone to have a curated list of common arguments and counter-arguments. Pleading for the Fourth amendment is satisfying but not terribly convincing to people who already believe surveillance is the right thing to do. So, here's a list:

**""I have nothing to hide!"" is irrelevant.**

* [Privacy isn't about having nothing to hide](https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/)! Surveillance grants the government a great deal of power to make decisions about you, and because the surveillance is secret, you get no say in the decisions. (Please read the article, or [the original paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565); I cannot summarize it in a single bullet point.)
* [We should all have something to hide](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/why-i-have-nothing-to-hide-is-the-wrong-way-to-think-about-surveillance/). The civil rights movement, interracial marriage, and gay marriage would never have been allowed if nobody had anything to hide. Free speech is essential to the exchange of ideas in democracy, but so is the ability to try new and socially-unacceptable things.
* You do have something to hide. The United States Code is so vast and complicated that you probably commit [several felonies a day](http://kottke.org/13/06/you-commit-three-felonies-a-day). (Please don't use the inevitable argument ""If you have nothing to hide, take off your clothes"" or similar arguments. The government isn't proposing to watch you in the shower. Yet.)
* If the government erroneously believes you *do* have nothing to hide, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. The evidence is secret and likely will never be presented to you.
* If the government chooses to use its surveillance against you, it can pick and choose which parts to present in court. Because the rest is classified, you do not have the right to use it to try to exonerate yourself.
* Even if the government does not attempt to attack *you* using surveillance data, any prosecution (or illegal abuses; see below) it takes against other people will make you reluctant to use your First Amendment rights to free speech. ""Better not say anything, or I might end up like *that* guy.""

**Oversight-free surveillance isn't necessary for national security.**

* The problem isn't surveillance -- it's surveillance without adequate oversight and targeting. National security could be preserved by a program which also respects our civil rights. The Fourth Amendment does not ban surveillance. It bans surveillance without judicial oversight and clear limits. An order to collect *all* phone records clearly violates this.
* Terrorism isn't as vast a threat as it's made out to be. [You're just as likely to be killed by a deer](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/blind-terror-dumb-state) as by Al-Qaeda. [Food poisoning, drunk driving and obesity](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/the-irrationality-of-giving-up-this-much-liberty-to-fight-terror/276695/) kill more people each year, but we're willing to cede our liberty to fight terrorism and [not to fight Big Gulps](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/nyregion/judge-invalidates-bloombergs-soda-ban.html?)?
* Any large data-mining program is [statistically bound to be overwhelmed by false positives](http://bayesianbiologist.com/2013/06/06/how-likely-is-the-nsa-prism-program-to-catch-a-terrorist/) which consume government time and resources and mean most people marked as ""probably a terrorist"" and put under more extensive surveillance will likely be innocent.
* Is there really evidence that this surveillance preserves our national security? So far, there is [some doubt](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/nsa-surveillance-data-terror-attack) that the administration's examples of foiled terrorist plots were actually foiled by the NSA's surveillance. (Wyden and Udall [agree](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/senators-challenge-nsa-surveillance-terrorism).)
* The NSA could save more lives by using pervasive surveillance to mail tickets to people who text and drive.

**Metadata invades your privacy.**

Metadata is probably more invasive than most searches that require a warrant. You could not obtain most of this information by strip-searching me:

* From your choice of friends, [I can determine your sexual orientation.](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2611/2302)
* Your cell phone records reveal your place of work, the popular events you have attended (including political events and protests), your mode of transportation, and presumably your favorite restaurants and spots for romantic flings.
* Your cell phone location records are unique, and [four data points can be used to uniquely identify you](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html). Switching cell phones will not save you -- the new phone will show the same pattern of movement, and can be linked to you.
* Your credit card purchase history (which [is also collected by the NSA](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324299104578529112289298922.html)) can be mined to reveal all sorts of details about you, such as [whether you are pregnant](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html).

Targeting people based on metadata, such as who they call and spend time with, is targeting based off of their First Amendment right to freely assemble and associate.

It is also important to note that while the phone surveillance program only collects metadata, PRISM collects all sorts of Internet data -- emails, instant messages, photos, and so on. This is supposed to be done with a warrant from the FISA court.

**Revealing surveillance programs doesn't harm national security.**

* Oh no, now the terrorists won't use phones or the Internet! Perhaps we can't intercept messages sent by carrier pigeon, but by forcing them to switch to less efficient means of communication, we have already disrupted their plans.
* No terrorist will realize ""the government is on to us!"" after reading that the government is watching everyone. It's equivalent to thinking the government is watching no one.
* The continued secrecy of programs which violate our rights harms our security -- security from the abuses of our government. Consider the case of [Joseph Nacchio](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/qwest-ceo-nsa-punished-qwest-refusing-participate-illegal-surveillance-pre-9-11).

**The government has a history of abusing surveillance.**

Not too long ago I took part in an online messaging effort to express my concerns about the NSA's ever-reaching eyes and ears. Recently, you have distributed an email in response to this issue. In said email you seemed as if you were attempting to assuage my fears by reminding me that laws have been passed to allow this, congress has approved it multiple times, and FISA is keeping the surveillance in check. Unfortunately, these things make me even more unsettled. You see, the 4th Amendment reads: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."" You likened the information gathered to that of a phone bill. Yet, according to the 4th Amendment, ""papers"", which a phone bill (or similar document/information) should be protected from the governments prying eyes without a warrant.

So now, with what's been disclosed in your email, our problem is much bigger than just the NSA. Yes, we have the NSA violating the 4th Amendment. However, it doesn't stop there. We have a government that has passed laws allowing for the violation of the 4th Amendment. We have a congress that has repeatedly approved, with a strong majority, the violation of the 4th Amendment. On top of all of this, we have the FISA court that is supposed to be a check and balance, but in reality is a kangaroo court that never says ""no"" to the NSA and has zero transparency.

You claim that you work ""hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights"". Yet you continue to support these policies and activities that violate the very same Constitution and Americans' privacy rights.

You claim that taking away these constitutional rights has and will continue to save lives. However, I know that a far greater number of lives were laid down to establish and protect these rights that you have so blithely cast aside. How many more rights do plan on disregarding in the name of safety? Will you put video cameras and microphones on every lamp post like China does? Will you then place them in our homes? It undoubtedly would prevent terror attacks if nobody could say or do anything without the NSA watching. Maybe even bring back those internment camps from WW2 for people of Arab or Persian decent, (I mean, come now, we're already violating the 6th and 8th amendments with Gitmo.)
You see, the more rights we take away, the safer we will be. That makes sense. When was the last time there was a terrorist attack in North Korea? They don't have enough freedom there to pull something like that off. They are safe.
America isn't supposed to be the land of the safe. America is supposed to be the land of the free. Its founders knew a line had to be drawn somewhere. A line that said to the government ""you only have the authority to go this far."" That line is the Constitution. Our Federal government, hand-in-hand with the NSA, has crossed that line and no excuse or explanation you give me will make me okay with that.

Have you come to the conclusion that our government cannot be trusted, and that every branch of government is corrupt? 

Do you want to do something about it, but don't know what to do, or worse still do you feel like there is nothing you CAN do?

There is something you can do! There is something we can ALL do. We can put people into government that represent OUR interests. We can vote out the officials which do not care at all about us, and elect officials who do.

That is where the ""tea party"" movement succeeded, and the ""Occupy"" movement failed. To make this work, it needs to be about more than just ""outrage"", but we need to have clear and concise demands, goals, and a plan to achieve them.

If you agree with these demands, then please subscribe:

1. By exercising our right to vote and peaceful protest, the removal from office of any official in government who acted against our fourth amendment rights. No apologies, no amends, simply removal from office. They have betrayed their oath to protect and defend the constitution, and must be removed.

2. Repeal the patriot act and other similar laws. If our currently elected representatives will not do so (highly unlikely), than we shall in the course of time elect those who will.

3. The implementation of a transparent government which respects the fourth amendment and represents the interests of the people of the United States of America.

How?

1. We must organize, both online and offline. We must do so as one united group with one purpose. We may be of very different political and religious beliefs and backgrounds, but we must agree to set our differences aside for a greater purpose. We must be united on this one front: The right to be secure in our persons from unlawful search and seizure is our right as human beings and we refuse to consent to be governed by a government which fails to respect that.

2. Tell people about this! Spread the word. The larger we become, the stronger we become. True political power is found in numbers. 

3. Contribute. Everyone can contribute whether by helping to spread awareness, or contributing your own opinions and ideas. 

Do not worry yourself that most people in this country are complacent and do not care. The good news is, it is the people who DO care that possess the power to enact real changes in government. 

There are many who are ready to act now. There are many more who are sitting on the fence and would be willing to act but are waiting to see others step up to the plate first. If you start, others will follow.

The good news is, this subreddit has grown to over 12,000 members in just a few days. The bad news is, managing a subreddit of 12,000 members is no easy task! Further, as happens to any community that grows to this size, especially a political community, there will be trolls and troublemakers. Unfortunately, it is simply not possible for myself and our small team of moderators to properly deal with all of that while at the same time working with event organizers.

Therefore, I am proposing the following changes to this subreddit. If you agree or disagree, please post within this thread.

**Proposed Policy Changes:**

1. No posts (comments are fine. everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion) which are not directly relevant to this movement. That means no Anti-Obama, no Anti-Republican, no Anti-Democrat, no Anti-Libertarian, etc. Nothing that could be seen as polarizing, or that could create the false impression that this subreddit is politically leaning in any particular direction. There are plenty of other subreddits that can be used for that purpose.

2. Do not make posts which are unnecessary and push down legitimate posts. This isn't about getting internet points. If there is a post made about a particular organizer trying to get support, and no one can see that post because of 100 totally unrelated posts, that does no one any good. In the coming days, there will be a LOT of posts related to specific upcoming events in different areas, and it is very important that everyone is able to see them. 

Remember: There are people who are trying to derail this, and the number one way to ensure that they do not succeed is for the rest of us to *stay focused*. That means one topic, one purpose, one goal. All of us who are dedicated to this must do our best to see that this is done correctly.

----

The next topic... We have over 60 cities that are trying to organize planning meetings, rallies, and protests. **We need your help.** Please visit /r/rtforganizers and do your part to help organize. I am going to be spending most of today editing those posts to make sure all information is up to date. I am already getting overwhelmed with this, and I cannot do it alone. 

If you see cities on /r/rtforganizers that are ready to go, have confirmed times and locations for an event or events, then please message me with the subject ""City Confirmed"" so that I can quickly add it to our confirmed events list.

----

Last topic: Moderators. Because I have been overwhelmed with the tremendous task of managing this subreddit, I have had to add a number of moderators. Further, some of the moderators I have added have themselves added additional moderators to help out. Ensuring that we have moderators which treat everyone fairly and are dedicated to this movement is of critical importance to me. Please notify me directly if a moderator is not treating you fairly. Use the subject ""Moderator Complaint"" so that I can find it easier.

----

Comments and suggestions welcome and appreciated.

Why not here?** 

*Occupy* brought attention to disparity and some injustices, yet the ""too big to fail"" banks are bigger yet and our elected officials are deaf to the voices of US citizens. Congress is at or near an [all-time low approval rating](http://www.ibtimes.com/congress-approval-rating-all-time-low-obamas-lowest-2011-1360879) and our Director of National Security has been [caught lying](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/350699/clappers-lie-charles-c-w-cooke) directly to our elected officials.

The US system of governance has been corrupted. It's not just one segment either.

* The judicial system has made absurd rulings [equating money to speech and declaring corporations as people](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/01/money_isnt_speech_and_corporations_arent_people.html).

* President Obama maintains a [secret interpretation of the Patriot Act](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120316/00101618123/senators-tell-obama-administration-to-reveal-its-secret-interpretation-patriot-act.shtml) which he has used to expand on the Bush era surveillance programs.

* And let's face it, our lawmakers in Congress voted in the Patriot Act and FISA amendments. Just last week, the majority of US Representatives voted to [maintain funding of NSA programs](http://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2013/07/vote-on-amash-amendment-reveals-ruse-of-two-party-system/#.UfVzt237b9k) which have been proven to perform blanket surveillance on all Americans.

**The electoral process has failed us.** We should spread the word -- wide and loud -- that the working masses will not be cooperating in this broken system anymore until a couple badly needed reforms are made:

1. End the Patriot Act. One way that has been suggested to do so is to simply end the [""state of emergency""](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/11/message-continuation-national-emergency-respect-certain-terrorist-attack) which is used to justify continuation of the program.

2. Campaign. Fianance. Reform. I'm talking significant change like that proposed by [Ackerman &amp; Ayres](http://www.gvpt.umd.edu/lpbr/subpages/reviews/ackerman-ayres904.htm).

""Surveillance supposedly undertaken to protect our democracy now presents a threat to it.

It's not simply that this surveillance has dramatic implications for individual privacy, though plainly it does.

Pervasive surveillance is also poisonous for free speech and free association. People who know the government could be monitoring their every move, their every phone call, or their every Google search will comport themselves differently. They'll hesitate before visiting controversial websites, they'll hesitate before joining controversial advocacy groups, and they'll hesitate before exercising rights that the Constitution guarantees. Now individually those hesitations may appear to be inconsequential, but the accumulation of those hesitations over time will alter the nature of our democracy, it will alter citizens relations to one another, and it will alter their relationship to their government. That much is clear from a history of many other countries.""

We cannot afford for that to happen again.  Here's a list of some ways we can improve the next protest, and I invite anyone to think of more:

**1) Dress to impress.**

[Here](http://media-1.web.britannica.com/eb-media/46/7546-004-7F54297C.jpg) is a picture of some of the dapper Civil Rights Protesters you'd see in the 60s.  [Here's](http://museumredscare1920.wikispaces.com/file/view/sacco_and_vanzetti.jpg/133909295/357x232/sacco_and_vanzetti.jpg) a picture of goddamn *anarchists* for Christ's sake!

You may want to bring your bongos and face paint to express your values and how you feel inside.  There's nothing wrong with that, HOWEVER, it's just preaching to the choir, and no one whose opinion you are trying to SWAY will take you seriously looking that way.

As a redditor once said, look and act at all times like a malevolent media organization is filming you, and your grandmother is watching.

**EDIT:** Yes, please, no guitars, no pot-smoking, no face paint, no masks, no looking different. We all need to look extremely average, but well-dressed IMO. - (/u/checkboxes)

*If you don't have a suit, dress as nice as you can!  The point is, don't look like you are going to a party.* (suggested by /u/AgainstRichSupremacy)

**2) No violence, no threatening masks or appearances**

As activist Blase Bonpane says, “If anyone in your movement advocates violence, always assume they are an undercover government agent.""

For more explanation, check out this [incredible article](http://wagingpeace.org/articles/db_article.php?article_id=301&amp;fb_source=message) where I found this quote, written by West Point grad, Iraq war veteran and peace activist Captain Paul K. Chappell.  Everyone *needs* to read this article before attending or planning any protests.

&gt;Assume you are being watched. Do NOTHING to support violence, or imply the threat of it in the future.
Regardless of how you feel, all it takes is one little leak of ""purported threats against law enforcement officials"" to have a hammer come down on us.
We cannot be seen to support or consider ANY violent action.

-(/u/animusvoxx)

**3) Don't get mad, get calm, patient and thorough**

One of the biggest problems of OWS was alienating people that should've been on board with our ideas, but instead they felt that we were too young/radical/hippie for them to support.  Learn to speak in a language that even your grandpa would agree with.  Because at the end of the day, ALL AMERICANS SUPPORT THIS.  Tell your more conservative relatives, friends and neighbors why this is so important to our national security.  Talk about how passionately you care about our Constitution.  Say why you believe the actions of the current (and previous) administration go against what our founding fathers, and all veterans - past and present - have fought for.

You catch more flies with honey - act and speak in a way that will create allies.  We need to organize and stand strong together, NOT insult and repel with angry and extreme rhetoric.

**4) Have a plan.**

Saying you are upset or that shit is fucked up is not enough.  What do we want?

**EDIT:** 

*""Stop spying on us.""* - (/u/naphini)

Repealment of the PATRIOT act, transparency, controls on domestic surveillance, upholding the 4th amendment and declaring the unalienable right of the people to be secure in their privacy from any government who wishes to infringe upon that liberty, and repeal and call unconstitutional any law in opposition of those freedoms. (edit suggested by /u/Legionof1)

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

 - 1) The entire Patriot Act isn't bad.. But Section 215 definitely needs to go (read up on it, this is the vague section that the NSA has used to justify PRISM, etc.. Basically the bulk of its surveillance)
 - 2) Shut down PRISM
 - 3) Shut down Boundless Informant, and any other programs like it that come to light
 - 4) Section 206 of the Patriot Act, the part allowing for wiretapping, can go too
 - 5) And FISA (wait.. that's Section 215, right?)
 - 6) Oh hell, repeal the Patriot Act. - (/u/Wakata)

**5*) Stay focused** (added by /u/Liberty4theStates)

As a community stay focused on the privacy issue, and resist attempts at hijacking/over-broadening the scope of things, even if you also agree with the sentiment contained in the hijacking.

The dilution and hijacking of Occupy's initial focus on financial reform and money in politics a significant drag on its effectiveness.

Maybe efforts like this really can be done without organized leadership, as Occupy tried, but if it's going to work, I'd imagine there has to be an early agreement and widespread understanding in the community that laser-focus on the original issue is crucial and needs to be enforced by the group in general every day to avoid drift and ultimate failure.

**6*) No Us vs. Them, only *us***

&gt;if I wanted to destroy the Occupy Movement the first thing I would do is encourage people in the movement to have an “us versus them” mentality. The government is notorious for planting undercover agents in social movements who intend to destroy the movement from within, and anyone who wants to destroy the Occupy Movement should use agents to increase the “us versus them” rhetoric.  This can be done with signs and slogans that portray all wealthy people, corporate employees, and police officers as evil. Occupy Movement protests in many cities have had signs with the words, “Eat the rich” (which is a message that endorses violence), and during the Occupy Oakland protest a picture was taken of an activist holding a sign, “All my heroes kill cops.” If a government agent wasn’t behind that sign, then a protestor was doing the government’s work for free.""

-Cpt. Paul K. Chappell

**7*) Branding the movement** (/u/Legionof1)

Do not brand this tea party or OWS, this is RT4, We do not want to be a offshoot of the tea party or we will be mocked as right wing, we do not want to be a offshoot of the OWS or we will be mocked as 20 year olds who do not want to pay their college tuition. This is a bipartisan, non religious protest. We are after the true and full restoration of our rights to 4th amendment liberty.

**8*) Learn how to negotiate** (/u/philosophyisenergy)

Practice with each other in your group on scenarios like salary negotion etc to get better before going live. Learn about concepts such As ""best alternative to a negotiated agreement"", when to walk away, cognitive biases, when to reveal information and others. [This book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0073381209/ref=redir_mdp_mobile) is excellent.

Also read [machiavelli's the prince](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm) to learn all the dirty tricks that will be played on you and be prepared. Watch the movie ""revolver"" to learn how your ego will get you in trouble and how to get past it. Learn active meditation to keep from losing your cool - Always be the most confident and calm person in the room. Fear nothing and let nothing get under your skin. If something makes you sweat or feel anxiety you lose. Channel that anxiety into will to power, use it to control and suck energy from your opponent

**9*) Stay legal.**

Get permits and protest legally. That is something that caused the ""Occupy"" movement a lot of problems. - (/u/timetoact2013)

**10*) Organize and Elect.** 

&gt;Work as a community to support candidates that are against these surveillance programs for the 2014 midterm elections and hold them accountable. If a Democrat or a Republican will not do this, work to elect someone that will, whether they be Green, Libertarian or of another party.
- (/u/FireKnightV)

Most importantly, we need to make direct, *political* threats against incumbent representatives, meaning we need to let them them know clearly that we will NOT vote for them if they do not support these initiatives, which means how *they* vote on these initiatives, not empty promises. - (edit suggested by /u/VyseofArcadia)

I've been hanging around on the subreddit and intermittently in the IRC channel for a little while now, and I've picked up on a few ways we might be able to help out the movement:

* Offering our online event-planning tool to work for July 4 rallies. It’s based on the MoveOn.org tool that lets people easily organize events and invite others to join.
* Driving our activists to rallies in major cities.  
* Giving rally organizers access to materials we're pulling together -- pamphlets, factsheets, etc.
* Relaying your questions to the other orgs in our coalition, including the EFF, Mozilla, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future, and seeing how they can help.
* Reaching out to the notable individuals who've signed StopWatching.Us to see if we can get some celebrity power at the bigger rallies.

We're also working on setting up in-district meetings with certain senators and reps during the congressional recess in August; those still thirsty for action after July are definitely invited to attend those.

1373818469.0,366,self.restorethefourth,1ia4o1,All of the great social movements of our time owe their success largely in part to social media. So today I am proposing a HUGE twitter blitz.,463,97,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1ia4o1/all_of_the_great_social_movements_of_our_time_owe/,"**How many of you guys liking this are actually tweeting?**

**tl;dr** Tweet up to 200 hundred tweets on the most popular tweets relating to us using our official hashtag #restorethe4th and our logo on your profile http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV IT REALLY IS ESSENTIAL. Please we need your help. Happy tweeting.

**Tweets you can use:**
""Stop #nsa spying and #restorethe4th amendment. restorethefourth.net""

""Don't let #Snowden's sacrifice go to waste.""

""End #nsa spying and #restorethe4th restorethefourth.net""

I know people don't take twitter seriously. But it's the perfect way to get the word out. You can message anyone, comment on anything and people do listen. I have done this so much since we began and I've gotten some very big names to retweet my stuff. Everyone from journalists to activists, to bloggers people really listen to. 

**Guidelines**
Here are some tips to get you started.

1. The way you do this is you get our logo http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV and you put it on the picture of your account so people know you're with us and they see what this is. 

2. You make a tweet that is short and uses our official hashtag #restorethe4th. Tell people what we do or a short to the point thing like ""end #nsa spying"" and then you send them to our website restorethefourth.net so they can find a local rally and get some info.

3. Go to the search bar and type in a related hashtag. The most popular ones are #nsa and #snowden you will see all the tweets that are the most popular and you gotta reply to those because more people will see them.

4. Don't care about who you're tweeting you have to reply to the most popular ones even if it isn't a person's account but msnbc's or kim kardashians. Your target with the largest accounts isn't the accounts themselves, but the people who see them and people see the A LOT.

5. Use hashtags in your tweet. #nsa is the most popular one. But you also should use our hashtag and any hashtag that is popular. You can see the trending hashtags on the left side midway through the page. That way more people see them cause they search what's trending.

6. There is a spam filter on twitter. Its a little complicated but I've got it down. You should only add about a 100 a day and 200 tweets per day. They say the limit is 500 but if they're not spaced out during the day, then you'll get a warning, but you can do 200 tweets in one sitting without trouble.

7. Put RT: or RTWT: At the beginning of your tweet that tells people you want what you're saying spread around. It sounds dumb but it WORKS


**Steps**

1. Set up an account or use an old one. This entails supplying an email you haven't used there if the account is new and putting our logo http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV on the account.

2. Search for related subjects like #NSA #snowden in the search bar and in the list of tweets reply to as many possible, up to 200 tweets with something like:

""Stop #nsa spying and #restorethe4th amendment. restorethefourth.net""

""Don't let #Snowden's sacrifice go to waste. End #nsa spying and #restorethe4th restorethefourth.net""

Feel free to post good tweets and have others use them. **The Tweets must have restorethefourth.net and #restorethefourth in them** because that way people know who we are and more people here about us through the spread of our hashtag.

**Don't care who you tweet. Nobody is off limits. The most success I've had has come from accounts that were famous, news channels, journalists. Anyone and everyone that has traffic and is related to our cause.**

**DONT SPAM**
https://blog.twitter.com/2010/state-twitter-spam
That is twitter's definition of spam. Learn those like your bible and make sure that you never go beyond those limits. ;)

These include protests, marches, supporting political candidates who believe in our cause and opposing those who do not. 

We do not advocate or support violence or unlawful behavior in any way. Any posts or comments which fail to meet this standard shall be removed. Should you encounter them, please report them so that moderators can remove them.

----

For those of you who would make such posts, I want to say this: 

You must understand that as strongly as you feel about this issue, the most effective means at our disposal for enacting real change is to put people into government that support our ideals, and that can only be done through peaceful means.

If you want to see an end to the trampling of our personal freedoms, then you must protest, march, make your voice heard, and bring others to join in. NO ONE WILL JOIN IN if this is not a peaceful movement. 

We all understand that you are angry, and you have every right to be. The ONLY way this movement will work is if we can get others to join our cause, and NO ONE is going to join our cause unless they can see it is a peaceful and lawful movement. If you advocate violence in any way, you harm the very ideals you are trying to help. 

----

**Here are the facts:**

1. ANY posts or submissions on this subreddit which advocate violence WILL be used to hurt and discredit our movement. You can bet there are people out there who badly want to discredit our movement, and we must give them no ammunition to do so.

2. If you really care about the movement, then you should understand this also. I understand you are angry, and you have every right to be. If you really want this to succeed, then recognize why there is a need to make sure we do this RIGHT. That means legally, peacefully, and lawfully. 

3. I personally care for the safety of anyone who attends protests that are planned through this movement. Therefore, I intend to do everything in my power (and the other moderators are in agreement) to ensure that is the case. I want those who attend these protests, myself included, to have a positive and enjoyable experience -- not end up hurt because of some violent idiot.

Aren't we outstanding citizens? Why do we and they have to be enemies? Couldn't we appeal to the majority to stop demonizing the average citizen?

I get it, corruption. But wouldn't that allegedly be the most senior members? There is not enough manpower among corrupt senior officials to control us. What can we do to separate the good people from corruption so that we can retain our freedom?

What is it that motivates the basic NSA employee to want to invade our privacy? Am I missing something? Are they better at catching predators than we think? Is there a reason that I'm not allowed to know that somehow justifies this or something? If it's just corruption, how do they have the best people doing their dirty work?

This post is long, and it is detailed, and every single bit of it matters if you have any outrage at all over the NSA, FBI, and other agencies essentially recording everything you do.

My name is Jordan. I have lots of experience with these kinds of issues, and these kinds of situations, from the perspective of the average Joe. Back in 2007 I first got involved in Ron Paul's campaign for President (don't worry, I'm not going to talk about him at all), and after the first ""money bomb"" fund-raiser, the whole community felt another should be done since it had gone so well. Being a web developer I started working on a page to organize it, and I chose December 15th, because it was Bill of Rights Day. Trevor Lyman, who had organized the first money bomb on November 5th, wanted the 16th because it was the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. We compromised and opted for events on the 15th and donations on the 16th, made our web pages, then organized people around it.

Some people really got in to it, re-enacting the Boston Tea Party, and this event, this discussion between me and Trevor Lyman, is where the Tea Party got its moniker from. Him and me were never very pivotal to that movement itself, but we by happenstance gave it its name.

I told you this story for one very important reason: **you don't have to do anything except show up to change the course of history. That is literally it.**

I was also the PR Director for Occupy Portland (the OWS protest in Portland, Oregon). Tea Party and Occupy have been painted as opposed, but they are actually quite similar and fighting for many of the same things. My point is that I have seen this from many angles, many times.

But this time, it's different.

This protest must take place on the Fourth. It will not succeed otherwise, I can virtually guarantee it, and this is why.

**The Police**

The police only know one way to respond to protests, and we saw it with Occupy. Force. Sometimes it's dressed up for the camera to placate the people at home, but force is the only tool in the toolbox for them in this situation. It does not have to be organized through DHS or the FBI (although it was for Occupy). The police are more concerned with preserving the status quo, that's their job, and protests are definitely disruptions of the status quo.

*If* this protest takes place on the Fourth, the police will not be able to use as much force, or at least if they do, it will not be seen as legitimate. The reason for that is...

**Symbolism**

Do not discount the value of this. You protesting *for* your Fourth Amendment rights, on the 4th of July, the Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence.

That kind of symbolism will break through the lethargic apathy that most people feel. It's the exact kind of jingoistic thing people are trained to respond to up through high school, and it is very clever to turn it around against the government itself.

Further, people will be far more sympathetic to the cause itself on the Fourth because it can very much be described as the thing the holiday celebrates. This means that police force will be viewed much more harshly, which police departments will know and account for.

**Juxtaposition**

The very fact that you will be using the almost programmed patriotism of the populace to turn people *against* the governments actions will be *very* difficult for the average person to ignore. The message can be summed in to a single sound-byte that will create cognitive dissonance inside people's minds. 

Unlike things that are simply unpleasant, cognitive dissonance in the mind forces you to either change your position, or reject reality itself.

The fact that we are supposed to feel pride on the 4th will be juxtaposed with the reality of what our government is doing to us, and in what ways.

It will be very uncomfortable, but the message will not only be *heard*, it will be *internalized*.

**Time**

There is enough time between now and then for everyone to really make things happen and think ahead. Organize medics, equipped with 50/50 Malox/water for pepper spray. Organize police liaisons to act as a buffer between the protest body and the police. Create a structure of *decision*, so that a few people with the relevant information can make decisions to benefit the protest quickly.

But before the actual protest, you also get to mention it *over* and *over* to the people around you. ""What are you doing for the fourth?"" Don't give them the 20 minute speech, give them a 2 minute answer. ""Oh, I'm going to protest that NSA thing. You heard about that, right? Where they're recording all our conversations and emails and crap? Well anyway, that's pretty fucked up, and I can't think of anything that's more like the real Fourth of July than protesting *that* kind of thing. Should be pretty fun actually.""

It also gives time to organize things like food or drink or music or entertainment. If you have those things, people will stay longer. Feeding possibly 10's of thousands of people is not easy, but no one person needs to do all this alone. If you want to really have the kind of power a protest like this should have though, don't ask people to do it without some truly ""4th of July"" food and drink. No alcohol, ever. But hotdogs, lemonade, etc.

**Media**

You cannot even fathom how much the media will love this story. You will get the most favorable media coverage you can possible hope for if this happens on the fourth. Trust me, I was the PR Director at Occupy Portland, as I said before. I know how the media works, the local media, the national media. If you want to be treated fairly, or fuck it, if you want to have an advantage, the Fourth is your best bet.

---

So here's your checklist:

- Have structure of organization *before* the protest. (Make it transparent with meeting notes and minutes if possible.)
- Have an established structure to disseminate real-time instruction to any size of crowd.
- Plan and prepare people for the police using military tactics.
- Do not record the exact sequence or plan of events in any digital format. If possible, separate the information in to several people so that no one person knows the whole plan. (I can expand on this if people want.)
- Prepare to care for common protesting injuries: tear gas, pepper spray, sprains, broken bones, gashes and scratches, etc. (What, you just woke up to what's been going on? Did you think this would be easy? If you want them to stop, you will have to take your lumps, there's already too much corruption for us to pretend someone, somewhere won't get hurt.)
- Prepare events, entertainment, food and drink for *as many people as possible*, and have contingency plans if too many people show up. Do not have everyone doing the same thing for more than 15 minutes if possible... change up what's going on often enough to keep people engaged and enraged.
- Create a way to track and support anyone who is arrested. If possible, get in touch with one of the many non-profit lawyer's groups who support protesters to have lawyers on stand-by.
- Make sure EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN PERSON knows this: ""If you are stopped by an officer, ask if you are being detained. If you are being detained, tell them 'I do not consent to a search, I will not say anything else, and I want to see a lawyer'. Invoke your 4th, 5th and 6th amendment rights all at once, and then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY ANOTHER SOLITARY WORD until you are either released or you see a lawyer."" The police are legally allowed to lie to you, even when questioning or detaining. They can and will tell you something is illegal even if it isn't. Do not say ANYTHING at all, other than the exact phrase above.
- Cameras. Lots of cameras.
- Make sure that it should be *fun* for the people involved, (again, assume the worst as I've detailed above, but plan for the best).
- Be prepared to deal with a lot of [apathy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/14n14m/what_can_be_done_about_voter_apathy_and_why_isnt/c7emvxk)

The American people have a right to know the actions of their government. Accountability is the foundation of democracy, and it is necessary to ensure the protection of the Constitution and the people it serves.

#2. Ensure that the scope of government surveillance is constitutional, limited, clearly defined, and strictly enforced.

Surveillance activities must be conducted within the legal bounds defined by the Constitution and US law. In order to effectively defend the rights of the people, these bounds must be clearly stated and strictly enforced.

#3. Establish a clear and transparent system of accountability for the United States' intelligence community.

A clear system of accountability is required in order to properly enforce restrictions on surveillance activities. This system must be open and visible to the American people in order to ensure that proper protocols are followed.

**Restore the Fourth demands that the U.S. government:**

#1. Conduct a congressional hearing and a criminal investigation into the extent and constitutionality of domestic government surveillance programs.

A full investigation must be conducted to determine the scale and legality of the actions taken by the US intelligence community. This must include revealing the scope and duration of surveillance programs, as well as examining the institutional factors that allowed their creation. The methodology and results of the investigation must be made public.

#2. Reform the USA PATRIOT Act, specifically Section 215 but generally with respect to the rights of American citizens, and impose clear constraints on the powers granted by FISA.

Many legislative actions taken since 9/11 have allowed an expansion of government surveillance powers in the name of safety and security. It is vital that these powers be reined in to stay within the boundaries outlined by the Constitution.

#3. Take a federal stance against law-enforcement practices across the nation which also violate our physical security and privacy, such as “stop-and-frisk” and internal security check-points.

The PRISM program that has recently come to light is one of many slowly expanding violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. The safety and privacy of our persons must also be ensured.

#4. Hold those involved in government surveillance programs accountable to stringent and transparent judicial oversight.

Accountability is paramount to ensure such violations do not happen in the future. Those responsible for violating the Constitution must be brought to light and their conduct reviewed by a duly appointed judge to determine the legality of their behavior.

#5. Remove James Clapper from his position as Director of National Intelligence.

Director James Clapper gave misleading or false testimony before the Congress in response to inquiries by Senator Ron Wyden in a March 12, 2013 hearing. These statements are a breach of the public's trust, if not a violation of US law. As such, a full investigation must be conducted into Mr. Clapper's knowledge and testimony, as well as the legality of his actions.

We will hold demonstrations nationwide on July 4th, and are already coordinating efforts across the country to ensure a powerful message is sent on a day that is so symbollically significant to our liberty. We will exercise our First Amendment rights to Restore the Fourth.

The power of a government should exist to reflect the will of its people. We, the American people, demand that our government adhere to its Constitutional limits and respect our wishes. If those currently in office cannot or will not rectify the troubling violations of our rights, we will act swiftly to replace them. We urge you to act on these requests in order to end the violation of our rights and liberties, and to uphold the Constitution as you swore to do when you took office:

    ""I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States.""
    -Congressional Oath of Office

Awaiting Your Action,

Restore the Fourth

This year's convention was August 9-10 in Bend. Delegates are encouraged to choose one committee that they would like to join (e.g. economy, education, health care, immigration, etc.) and at the end of the convention, each committee reports its recommended changes to the rest of the body for a vote.

I signed up for the crime &amp; justice committee and, after we convened in a small room, introduced a new amendment that reads as follows:

&gt;We support Oregonians' right to privacy, specifically including personal possessions and electronic records, from mass surveillance, search, or seizure unless authorized by a specific warrant based on probable cause.

After some discussion and a couple of minor changes to the wording, all 18 members of the committee voted to adopt the measure. The next day (Saturday, August 10) we presented our recommendations to the rest of the convention (200+ people altogether) who voted to adopt it as the party's official position on the issue. It is now the official policy of the Oregon Republican Party that the NSA's PRISM program is a violation of Americans' right to privacy. ([Link](http://www.oregonrepublicanparty.org/Platform2013))

Even if you generally don't like Republicans (and in a couple of cases, I don't blame you), bear in mind that many of us are just as outraged by Snowden's revelations as you are. I am hoping that soon most of our members of congress will join Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and other privacy advocates in opposing all forms of warrantless surveillance and/or data collection.

Vivian Hurtad of the ""Wise Latinas""

Suzy Khimm

Igor Volskey of ""ThinkProgress""

Essentially the narrative was to discredit Snowden by highlighting the fact that he was a ""high school drop out"" and ""Left the army"" and was simply an ""I.T. Guy"" and had no real authority at NSA.

Volekey actually stated that he thought the real problem here was using outside contractors and not government workers at NSA.

SHARE THIS URL http://goo.gl/R0KiO (shorted version of this)  ON TWITTER, #RestoreTheFourth and spread this on Facebook, Daily Kos, Reddit! GET THE WORD OUT!


You can change the wording, but this is basically the points I believe #Restorethefourth is trying to drive home! 



**BE PREPARED WITH THESE TYPES OF ANSWERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT GET....**

* It's not about Edward Snowden, so I decline to give my opinion on whether I believe what he did or how he did it was correct. Instead, this should be about the government and restoring democracy and that's where the attention should be kept.

* I think a lot of people have forgotten their history. The reason everyone is celebrating today is because July 4th marks our independence and declaration as a sovereign nation. I think more important than getting drunk is changing history, even slowly and one small step or syllable at a time. I'm celebrating in my own way by exercising the rights so many men died to preserve. It's unfortunate that so many today seek to do away with those rights or subvert them entirely. 


&gt;It's not a matter of legality; I fully believe that these programs are 100% illegal, but being promoted under the color and cover of so called law. The issue is, the laws and justifications behind those laws are inherently broken on a fundamental level. Legal and constitutional in this case aren't synonymous, and that is a problem. The American government should be ashamed of breaking the supreme rule of the land in such a grievous way.


* Privacy is a huge issue, but not because we have something hide. It's a matter of principle and integrity of state. Privacy wouldn't have been part and parcel with the 4th amendment or U.S V Katz if the Supreme Court and the Founding Fathers thought ""meh, it doesn't matter""


&gt;We've already seen that the so called ""detriment to our country"" they claim these leaks have caused, hasn't come from Edward Snowden; but instead, from our own government's programs in the first place. Germany, for example, who we call an alley has publicly denounced this behavior as unacceptable. Ironic when you consider on the 18th they were the main example of other alley countries that ""do it too"". Even if it was true, and I really doubt it's anywhere near this scale, it doesn't make it right.


* The 4th amendment in spirit was designed explicitly to prevent these types of programs. 

((( The reddit admins used this :-3 )))


&gt;We live in a world where technology has become more efficient than human analysis, but a world where humans are in charge of oversight...and those humans can make mistakes or simply change the rules. 


* We have, so far, been shown absolutely no shred of proof that these programs do anything to make us safer, and in fact the Deputy director of the FBI was caught red handed (airquotes) ""misspeaking"" about the main 'Wall Street attacks' he mentioned to Congress on the 18th. It turns out the jury didn't convict at all, because there was no trial...just another case of the FBI busting it's own sting plots as propaganda fuel. 


&gt;These programs cost the tax payers untold amounts of money, with little to nothing to show for it. If I'm being kept safe, I'd like to know how! It's estimated that over 10 billion is allocated to NSA, only they classify the budget.


* **Secret laws and secret interpretations of those laws, like FAA (2008) section 702 or USA Patriot Act section 215, aren't what democracy is about.**

 ((( :D this is the blog quote (well it should be this is the FIXED and updated version....!! how sweet is that! )))

&gt;PRISM really isn't the focus here, nor is it a new phenomena. On the contrary, I can toss around several arbitrary code names like Stellarwind, Ragtime, Thinthread, Trailblazer, Total Informational Awareness, Boundless Informant and several other seemingly meaningless spook words dating back all the way to 1945 Operation Shamrock, but it's all meaningless unless people start to understand why we're opposed to the problem as opposed to just giving a random name to the problem itself.


* We're not related to occupy and we're unrelated to {insert whatever}. We are an extremely separate group of concerned American citizens, trying to raise awareness to the ends of bringing about peaceful change. Section 702 of FAA gives retroactive immunity and exoneration to telecommunication companies. What does that tell you about the legality behind it these laws in the first place, where the government has to make it impossible to sue for objectively wrong doing?


&gt;I don't think most people understand the true scope of what's going on. This isn't a simple case of illegal wiretaps or subversive pseudo subpoenas with gag-orders. They are quite literally analyzing every bit of data ever sent. Very little can be done to stop it because the means they use are so hihgly technical. They're not eating from the mouth of the river, they're eating from the source.


* It's not that we feel like they're spying on us directly, it's that they have the ability to do so with very little oversight. The oversight that they claim is in place is the equivalent of eating food, then checking what comes out the other end to see if it was poison.

&gt;Encrypting your data is a good first step, sure... but that's hiding. I think that hiding is a poor way to solve a problem if it's the only step you take. I think that taking steps to protect ones information is extremely important, but these will not solve this issue.


* The only way to cut through the darkness of secrecy is by casting light. Edward Snowden gave us the puzzle pieces, it's our job to put them together and come up with an alternative or stop them from completing their project of Total Information Awareness, since Congress was supposed to have scrapped that idea years ago...I don't understand why simply changing the name, outsourcing to contractors, and hiding it deeper precludes the cut budget and scrapped program.


&gt;I don't believe any one person caused this, or that anyone person can stop this. This is a runaway train and I think growing coalitions like this are the first step in applying the breaks.


* They have, on multiple different occasions, been caught red handed imperjuring themselves and the sad state of reality is that our elected officials are either too naive or complicit to see the lies for what they are.


&gt;We are a completely nonviolent coalition. Anyone who says otherwise has either hijacked our platform for their own selfish ends, or is mistaken entirely. I repeat, we are a peaceful assembly and are simply exercising our 1st amendment right to be heard and to address our government for a redress of grievances. 


* Personally, I don't care what Obama says. That man is a liar and a two faced politician like the rest of them. Hope failed us and the Change we Believed in was a fairy tale. I think he tricked a lot of us into voting him, some of us twice. In the context of surveillance and oversight, everything his campaign ran on was abolished as soon as he took office and in fact, he's expanded it at a quicker rate than Bush did in his second term. 


&gt;It's not that they're looking directly at what we say, it's that they can. It's the fact that they're saving everything into massive databases, for example the soon to open Utah Data Center is estimated by previous NSA whistleblowers like William Binney to hold zettabytes of information. That's an unfathomable amount of information...literally countless hours of HD video and sound can be stored and it wouldn't even scratch the surface. They're storing it ""on ice"" and using the strange logical loophole that ""not analyzing it"" means it's not a search or seizure. I'm sorry, but 50 years from now I don't want 2 terabyte hard drives of what I've written in a database, regardless of the context. 

* People, specifically the older generations who aren't growing up with this technology need to understand that it's not like it was in the 80s. I can fit your entire old record collection, every single song and record and all the pictures and then some on a drive the size of my pinky nail, literally. 


&gt;No, I don't think they're going to kick my door in, and I don't believe they'll assassinate me like some claim the FBI tried to do with Occupy leaders. Firstly, those claims were made without a shred of proof using fabricated documents and probably never happened...I don't believe there will ever be any direct retaliation because they don't take us seriously. Well they should. My words are extremely serious, and just because they've hidden away so well doesn't mean they're above reproach. Just because they've bent the law doesn't put them above it and one day soon, I believe these laws will snap. In fact, I believe that day is coming extremely soon.


* Think of this issue like a slow creeping mold or corrosive rust undermining our democracy. It took years to creep up and now some are saying that it's too late. I think we're infested, but I think with the right treatment, we can clean this mess up.

&gt;Yes, I did see the interview with [Miss Alabama](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8vXrqHurTc) and the spying programs like PRISM and it disgusted me. I don't believe that her highly uninformed and in my opinion vastly misguided opinion accurately reflects the voice and opinion in America in the slightest. Benjamin Franklin is said to have quoted it first, and I'm willing to take someone like Benjamin Franklin way more seriously than someone standing around in a bathing-suit no matter how hot some think she is.


* It's possible our words will go unheard sure, but if we let out voices fall mute now, they stand no chance of ever reaching those deaf ears...and I don't believe people are deaf to this and the fact I'm not alone here is testament to that.


&gt;I think writing congress is important, but I think more importantly are voting disgusting senators and congressmen and women from office should they choose to ignore their constituents or insult them like {WHO}


* The FBI is involved as well. Everyone is. We've allowed them to scare us into submission and freight trained broken legislation through Congress without a contingency. Even Congress has publicly stated FISA and Patriot are out of hand.


&gt;They've hidden themselves away, so I think it's disingenuous to assert that we could have taken steps earlier to stop this or that this is just reactionary fall out from Snowden's leaks. On the contrary, Snowden just gave us the information-tools to fight back.


* Under George W. Bush, we saw an internal push to stop this type of program. The Attorney general at the time John Ashcroft ruled the programs unlawful and unconstitutional. The President renewed the order and Michael Hayden then director of NSA continued on with the President's Surveillance Program anyway...what does that tell you about the type of so called democracy that fostered these programs into existence when there is rebellion among the ranks?


&gt;Personally, I'm just sick of the misinformation on both sides. The government is absolutely correct to assert that many civilians are uninformed. Unfortunately, we're only uninformed because these people have gone through such great lengths to hide illegal activity, corruption, fraud, waste, abuse under the color and cover of law...and as Thomas Drake says, when the color and cover of law isn't good enough, they simple make up the rules.


* Regardless of what these companies say, they are complicit at the highest levels. Even if they're being coerced, it's their responsibility as an establishment we trust to up hold user rights and to fight back. Google is no saint, but at least it took steps to fight National Security Letters in 2012 to the point where in 2013 a judge ruled them unconstitutional. That's right. One of the main tools being used by the FBI and NSA WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY A CALIFORNIA JUDGE. Pressuring these companies via their wallets is a great way to make a statement.


&gt;No, I do not expect overnight change just based on today. Again, this is a progressive problem that wasn't started overnight, quite literally more than a decade in the making. It's not something that's just going to go away because I'm here speaking today, but I hope through my words others can start to listen and really take notice of the issues involved.

* The older generation doesn't have to support this, this is our world to inherent whether they like it or not. Whether they stand in our way and cling to the ways of old remains to be seen. I've heard {those statistics}and I've heard us called naive for supporting Snowden and heard some go so far as to call us traitors. My response is simple. Do those calling people like myself a traitor even know what we stand for or what a traitor really is? I would wager they don't. I'm not insulting my elders, I just think it's grossly inappropriate to mis-characterize my demographic's intelligence and experience with systems they know next to nothing about, based simply on age. Do I sound naive, uninformed or inarticulate?  Do I sound like a traitor to my country?



&gt;Sure, I have some suggestions. Search out William Binney, and Thomas Drake if you'd like more information about what we're up against here. Although they're not directly part of this coalition or standing here today, the former NSA whistleblowers can give you the best comprehensive break down of the message we're trying to send...specifically look at Drake's speech at the National Press Club on March 18th of 2013.

* Some may say that it makes us safer and we respect that opinion; however, we strongly disagree with the reasons those people are accepting them programs. We feel it's a coping method. We also offer an alternative, in that we believe it is not only extremely possible, but possibly MORE EFFECTIVE to do this type of surveillance through other, limited in scope and special tailored means, within the confines of the constitution and through a set of amended laws.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1372832492.0,,,True,t3_1hgpav,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hgpav/talking_points_if_youre_interviewed_get_it_right/,

Dear [eternalexodus],
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs and the reports of wide-scale collection of Americans' phone records.  I appreciate that you took the time to express your thoughts about this very troubling issue.

Please know that I share your concerns over the recent disclosures related to the NSA's vast collection of Americans' phone records.  These disclosures have highlighted the significant gap between the government's interpretation of the PATRIOT Act and the public's understanding of it - a point that I have repeatedly raised.  Furthermore, the NSA has not demonstrated that its bulk collection of the phone data of millions of Americans has provided uniquely valuable intelligence beyond what is available through other, less intrusive surveillance programs.  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe that while we must protect our national security, we cannot lose sight of our constitutional liberties.  I have warned about this type of overreach for years, and I will continue to lead the charge to protect the communications of law-abiding Americans from indiscriminate collection and surveillance.

As part of my effort to establish greater transparency of the government's surveillance policies, I have advocated for the responsible disclosure of legal decisions that implicate our privacy rights and have sought clarity regarding the government's interpretation of its surveillance authorities.  I am also leading an effort to narrow the focus of NSA's bulk phone data collection program, partnering with a number of my Senate colleagues on legislation to reopen the PATRIOT Act to ensure that Americans without any links to terrorism or espionage do not have their private information collected by the government.  Finally, I have urged the NSA to disclose any evidence indicating that the bulk phone records collection program has provided intelligence that would not be otherwise obtainable.

I pledge to continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to restore Americans' faith in their government by pushing for the right balance between ensuring our national security and protecting Americans' constitutional rights.  As always, I will keep your thoughts and concerns in mind throughout this important process.
I will continue to listen closely to what you and other Coloradans have to say about matters before Congress, the concerns of our communities, and the issues facing Colorado and the nation.  My job is not merely about supporting or opposing legislation, but also about bridging the divide that has paralyzed our nation's politics.  For more information about my positions and to learn how my office can assist you, please visit my website at www.markudall.senate.gov.
 
Warm regards,

Mark Udall
U.S. Senator, Colorado""

I'm proud to live in a state with a powerful Senator taking such an admirable position; Udall serves on the Committee on Armed Services, which encompasses a few subcommittees that could have an impact on surveillance issues (though probably not directly).

If any of you find Senator Udall's position admirable, I urge you to send him an email or phone call, even if you are not a Colorado resident; as one of very few Congresspeople that is actively speaking out against NSA surveillance, Udall is a champion of our cause. Hope to see you all on Thursday ;)

Let's get some things out in the open.,185,27,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fzbfz/flags_and_symbols_are_important_lets_get_some/,"It seems to me that a key force behind this is going to be using the internet to spread this message.  That's been proven to work.  We can reach everyone in the 15-30 age range, no problem.  

The harder part will be reaching people our parents' age (apologies to older redditors here, I know you are here).  However, we NEED these people.  The police kettling a bunch of teens and 20 somethings is one thing.  But kettling a group of older Americans is going to be a MUCH different issue.  The pictures on the TV are important, and we need people of all ages and affiliations out there with us.    

A key part of this is going to be using symbols that are designed to unite rather than fragment people.  With occupy, we saw a lot of red fists and other ""revolutionary"" symbols.  These are great, but to the average American, it reads as ""communist takeover.""  That's not what we want.  

What we WANT is to unite as Americans.  The best thing for that will be to limit our choice of flags.  **Let's only carry the American flag.**  During the Arab Spring, one of the big things that kept coming up is ""Look at Tahrir Square.  You don't see a single non Egyptian flag.""  That was a huge key.  Use recognized symbols, change the meaning.  The American flag does NOT mean surveillance, endless war, and despair.  The American flag is a revolutionary flag.  It stands for the constitution.    

This flag was there in our classrooms as kids.  It holds a deep deep meaning.  Again, if there's a shot on TV of police firing teargas into a crowd waving ONLY the American flag, we're going to look like the heroes no matter what the talking heads try to say about us.       

Another good one is the [Gadsden flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_flag),  the ""Don't tread on me"" flag.  Yes, it was used during the Tea Party.  But **the Tea Party are our allies now, and in the early days of this, they are our audience**.  How great would it be for them to see young people carrying this powerful symbol of American freedom and resistance? They'll be watching for hints of communist kids out there to hurt them, and we need to send the message ""We're with you.  We understand you and we're here to stand by you.  Join us.""    

Keep in mind the audience.  We joke about 'MURICA but it's only because we've allowed OUR COUNTRY to be co-opted by assholes.  This is about taking that back, and it starts with the flag.  Let's our countrymen and women an American's dream come true.  **True patriots out in the streets fighting against tyranny.  Because that's the truth.  That's exactly what's happening.**  Then we give them our three demands (in the sidebar) and we'll see who is ready to join us.

Amash's amendment that would have defunded the NSA's phone collection program nearly passed yesterday, with 205 members of Congress voting for it.

This August, Congress will return home for their annual recess. This is the perfect time for some grass-roots lobbying. Every year Free Press organizes a number of in-district meetings between our members and their local legislators during the August recess. This year we made an online tool that lets local activists organize meetings themselves.
 
Scheduling in-district meetings would be an extremely effective strategy for Restore the Fourth during the month of August. It's a good way to channel energy toward something productive and effective after 1984 Day and before the next round of protests. Setting up the meeting is relatively easy -- much easier than planning a protest. Each meeting only needs 4-8 activists dedicated to attending. And in our experience, they really do make a difference. These politicians spend the entire year listening to corporate lobbyists, and August is their one-month window to hear personal stories from constituents.
 
[You can find the event tool here](http://act.freepress.net/event/2013_congress_meetings/search/). If you enter your zip code it'll show you the meetings already planned near you, or if there are none, encourage you to schedule your own. If the RT4 community dedicates itself to this effort with as much energy as was put toward the July 4 rallies, we could reach a significant portion of Congress and achieve substantial reform once they reconvene.

1370822517.0,147,self.restorethefourth,1g0fsd,Some thoughts and opinions from someone with a Masters in Political Science.,178,31,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g0fsd/some_thoughts_and_opinions_from_someone_with_a/,"Hi, I meant to post this yesterday when I got home, sadly someone stole my laptop. Looks like I won't be getting it back, so I'll just have to use my phone, so bear with me if there are any typos/grammar mistakes...posting on a phone is kinda hard. Yesterday it seemed like this movement was headed towards a flopping, but in just one day it looks like you guys have fixed some major issues, so I am confident this movement will work.

First, I don't claim to be an expert, and you can take my opinions or leave them. I've just worked in the field and figure my experience might be of some use. 

1. Know your goals and keep them as short and as simple as possible. Our goal here is pretty clear; we Americans demand the privacy we are entitled to. This is very important. The main reason the Occupy movement flopped is due to have too many goals and each demographic had different ideas on what that could be. For this movement, it doesn't matter what party or religion you subscribe to, we are ALL in this together. 

2. Avoid buzz words and overly 'technical' words - I cannot tell you how many fence sitters or voters who are trying to educate themselves will completely shut themselves off to your movement if you make things sound complicated. Instead of saying 'repeal', say 'remove'. I'm not saying we should dumb things down to a third grade level, but if you can use a simpler word that is universally understood, you should use it, especially in politics.

3. Keep your mission statement short and simple. Not only will this help inform people who don't know what your movement is all about, but it also keeps the group educated, which trust me, you are going to want this once the media starts interviewing random members. They are going to try to pick out the dumbest of the dumb, so if you keep things easy to remember, you have a less chance of that happening. Looking over on the side bar, I personally think as it is on Reddit, it is okay, but saying that in person is a mouth full and not too easy to remember.

Perhaps changing it to something  like this (please note these are rough ideas and ONLY meant to be an example on how to keep things short and simple and I am not suggesting we use these! I'm not an English major, someone else would be much better suited for this) :

 - We demand anyone involved with NSA removed from office immediately
 - Remove the Patriot Act and other laws or we will vote for someone else who will
 - We demand the transparent Government that represents the American people

I know these are terrible, I'm just trying to show how these should be shorter and easier if we want to make sure every demographic can understand our mission.

4. If you're going to use posters/icons for this movement (which you should, every successful movement has one), please make sure it isn't something that only one demographic will get while another would be scared of it or confused. None of that 'V for Vendetta' movie mask or Anonymous faces stuff. Not everyone has seen the movie, not everyone knows what that movie was about, and thanks to the media, anything with that mask or anything like it is assumed to be an evil hax0or. I have no idea what your icon/posters/symbols should be as designing is not something I'm good at, but try to keep it something all demographics can get behind AND understand. I remember seeing a poster of Obama taking off his face to reveal Bush behind the mask, something like that is something everyone would understand (Obama is no different than Bush) and it gets the message across.

5. Look for arguments that are going to be brought against you and prepare a counter attack. This is important because you don't want to be caught off guard if someone throws a question at you, especially on camera.  Looking at my Facebook dash, I can already tell you some of the counter arguments you are going to face:

- If you have nothing to hide, why do you care?
- It's for our protection against criminals, not us.
- It only affects other countries.
- Who cares, we share everything anyway (the younger generation is mostly the one saying this)

This job is again suited for someone better at English and with a working computer... I personally have been using the ol 'If you have nothing to hide, wide do you keep the blinds closed when you're eating or watching TV?' example, but I'm sure there are better answers to this.

6. You guys picked a great name for this movement and a great time to protest as well. Restore the Fourth is easy to remember and sounds like a jingle, plus it says a lot about your movement with just its name. The timing is also perfect, because planning a protest on the 4th of July is when there is going to be huge crowds. Even if the cops plan to stop you, how can they? If you dress like normal and keep your posters hidden until time to act, they aren't going to be able to tell you apart from the regular people who are just there to party. Unless they plan on arresting everyone, protesting on the fourth is a brilliant plan and you guys should definitely discuss in open what you're planning on doing, cause by the time they find out who is there to party and who is there to protest, it will be too late. That being said...

7. Dress nice, for the love of god. I'm not saying a suit or tie, but don't dress like a hippy or anything. yes, I know you shouldn't have to, but the sad reality is that the media is going to try and show the worst of the bunch and yes, people, especially older people, are going to judge you by how you look. Wearing a bunch of V for Vendetta masks and having offensive posters isn't going to convince people this is a serious issue, it's just going to make them think a bunch of kids are being loud and annoying. It is a very common tactic for the media and government to make any movement out to be the bad guy, so making this job harder/impossible is in your best interest! I cannot stress this point enough.

8. Don't get violent or rude. NEVER BE RUDE! Even if someone is being rude to you, just smile and be polite. This makes you look good and them look like assholes. If someone in the group is being rude, tell them to stop, and if they don't, distance yourself from them right away and depending on the context, publicly state that you and your group do NOT believe what that person did. You are very likely going to get people in the group who try to ruin your image for shits and giggles or worse, because someone is trying to destroy the movement from the inside. 

9. There is a chance you might get arrested or even abused by the cops. This is easier said than done, but one thing the occupy movement did right was they never fought back when the cops abused them. Never fight back. Think of the sit in movements back in the day; those kids were getting spat on, food thrown on them and yelled at, yet they just sat there and took it, so when the pictures came out, people were more sympathetic towards them then the ones screaming at them.

10. Know your rights. Lots of cops will try to screw you over and they can do this easily because most aren't aware of there rights. I can't find the link on my phone right now, but there is like a 40 min video on youtube (if someone could link it, that would be great) that shows you all the rights you have, and I CANNOT stress this enough, LEARN THEM! **if you take nothing else from this, if you get arrested, DO NOT TALK TO THE COPS. ASK FOR AN ATTORNEY AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!**

11. This next part is not meant to scare anyone or start anything, it's just a fact: the people on this sub, including the mods, could very well be informants. Let's not forget the mod of the main Occupy subreddit was an FBI informant. That being said, as long as you don't say or plan to do anything illegal, you will be okay. 

12. CALL AND WRITE YOUR OFFICIALS! Do not listen to Reddit, calling and writing DOES WORK! Yes, usually it's the interns that read them, but they still get passed on along to the person you are writing to, and they do take note of it. I've worked as an intern, getting a few phone calls about an issue you care about is a great way to get our attention and take the issue seriously. Since hardly anyone ever calls or writes, just a few of those can change a law or improve something, just think of how much you can get done if you gather everyone around and plan to devote a small amount of time to calling/writing.  

I have other stuff I wanted to say but my damn phone is about to die and I have to go out to my car to charge it... sorry for this.

Thank you for contacting me regarding the revelations of the National Security Agency's (NSA) intelligence collection programs.  I appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts with me.  As an Army veteran and Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which has oversight of these matters, I will always work to continue to strengthen our national security while protecting our cherished liberties.

I was shocked by the claims of Edward Snowden.  Mr. Snowden not only stole American secrets and put our soldiers and sailors at risk through his treasonous actions, but he lied.  He misled the public both about his importance and about the scope of our intelligence programs.

Let's get to the facts:

· No NSA program listens to the phone calls or tracks the content of the calls of American citizens or persons who are in the United States;

· No NSA program sees the contents of emails, text messages, Skype calls or other video communications of American citizens or persons who are in the United States;

· There is no ""Big Data"" storage of all of the contents of every communication of American citizens;

· The data collected on U.S. calls—entirely authorized by Congress and approved by the federal courts—is anonymous and limited to the date and time of the call and the phone numbers themselves.  There is no location information, tower strength data or other source to determine from where, physically, a call was made.

I, along with every Member of Congress, have had a chance to carefully review the actions taken by the valorous professionals at the NSA connected to these programs.  I am convinced that their intelligence collection actions are not only lawful and constitutional, but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical Islamic terrorism.  In fact, all three branches of government created by the Constitution continue to have oversight of, input into, and responsibility for the creation and execution of these programs.

As a veteran, I want our soldiers in the field to have the intelligence they need to perform their missions effectively.  As a conservative, and Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I take the balance between privacy and protecting American lives very seriously.  These anti-terror programs are crucial.  The government's interest in carrying out these programs is the most compelling imaginable: defending against terrorist attacks that could take countless innocent lives here in the United States and protecting our servicemen serving abroad. 

Eliminating these programs would return us to a pre-9/11 security posture that would make this country less safe.  A majority of Americans agree, and their support is likely to grow further as the speculation, sensationalism, and fear-mongering of the past few weeks are replaced with accurate information.

We cannot abandon the battlefield in the War on Terror any more than we can abandon other battlefields—too many lives are at risk.  These programs work.  In fact, they have worked close to home to stop terrorist plotters in Kansas City.  Over 50 terrorist schemes have been impacted and American lives have been saved—soldiers and civilians—because our professional intelligence community uses these programs.  We must support them.  We must continue our effective oversight.  We must win this War on Terror.

If you have any additional concerns, please do not hesitate to call on me or Jim Richardson of my Washington, D.C. staff.  It is an honor to serve the people of Kansas in the United States Congress.

Sincerely,

Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress""

This isn't a game.,177,48,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jd7fh/enough_this_isnt_a_game/,"We have all devoted too much time, effort, passion, and money for this to fail because of inflexibility. It has been nearly two months since the inception of Restore the Fourth and political infighting has stymied any effort to define an ideologically coherent or practically effective organization. It has been suggested that a schism is approaching. While severing ties with those we disagree with so vehemently will undoubtedly solve the problem of structural politics, it will also be the first step towards irrelevancy. Splintering will destroy the movement and prevent us from attaining our very simple, very reasonable goal. Namely, to restore protections guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment.

The arguments of both sides of this debate have merit. Both sides will have to swallow their pride, ignore their egos and hammer out a compromise.

The issue of branding: National owns RT4. That is an indisputable fact. They allow Local Organizations to operate under their brand. Expecting them to relinquish their brainchild to anyone and everyone to do as they please is foolish. They have both a right and a responsibility to manage how their brand is utilized.

On Local Autonomy: Local organizers have done, and continue to do a fantastic job. They are a vital part of the organization, without them RT4 would be a pitiful attempt at a think tank. I get the sense they are chomping at the bit to move forward. Understandably so as far, far too much time and momentum have been squandered. Expecting them to accept ""oversight"" is frankly, horseshit. The idea of having political officers embedded with local organizations to ensure they toe the party line is patently offensive. Perhaps having regional liasons to facilitate communication between National and Local would be a good middle of the road solution.

On Credentials: I've noticed several people highlighting this issue of ""credentials"". I know many well educated people who I wouldn't trust to watch a pot boil. Credentials can be achieved through diligence in the absence of competence. Lets put this issue to rest. How did National earn its credentials? By action, by creation, by birthing this movement. In fact, they earned it the same way Local Organizers did. By stepping forward and filling the void. By devoting time and energy towards creation. The solution? We accept the leadership we have and schedule a vote on Local and National leadership for Jan. 4, 2014. If they have failed to perform they get voted out. Don't tell me that we don't have time to test leaders, because we're treading water anyhow. Its not the best solution, it's the only solution.

On Structure: This should be very simple. There are two Chambers, National and Local. Each local organization elects a delegate to the Chamber of Delegates (One vote per Local Organization multiplied by Y organizations). Each National Committee member will be designated a Representative (Giving National 15 votes).  Each Representative has a vote. Any Delegate or Representative can introduce policy. That policy is voted on by each member of the Chamber of Representatives and each member of the Chamber of Delegates. A simple majority goes to National for review. National can pass the policy or veto it. If it is vetoed it returns to the Chamber of Delegates for a vote. A 2/3 vote overrules National's Veto.

A schism is a lazy solution and a selfish ambition. How can you honestly sit here in the midst of history and ponder how best to dismember the movement? History provides opportunities and we either seize them or let them pass into the ether. If you think anyone is taking us seriously at this point your deluding yourself. We don't seem to take ourselves seriously. I leave you to ponder [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qHP7VaZE) . The only difference between that and our movement right now is that the clip is intended to be laughable.

Post Script: Lest anyone conclude I am aligned with one faction or another, I am not. Under my proposal I would have no vote and no more influence then I do now, which is nil. My only ambition is to preserve the fourth (in every sense).

+ Verizon and AT&amp;T handed over phone call metadata for all customers.
+ There is a secret interpretation of section 215 of the PATRIOT act that is not being released to the public.
+ The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, admitted to lying under oath about collecting the phone records. 
+ That PRISM exists (how far have they claimed that it goes?).
+ Sen. Wyden admitted that on at least one occasion that NSA programs violated the 4th amendment.

Multiple, independent, non-official sources have indicated
-----------------------------------------------------
+ The US claims to have stopped terror attacks from this information, but will not provide the proof.
+ The Boston bombing suspects were not stopped by this system, despite the fact that they were on the radar of multiple agencies.


A single, ostensibly credible source has claimed

* (3:10pm) - Second speaker talks a little about the technical side of things, and the slippery slope of expansive government powers.

* (3:20pm) - Last speaker (Pete Ashdown, founder of XMission, a local ISP) - Did an awesome job covering the whole topic. He talked about how XMission has received many warrantless requests for user information and how Utah has made it legal to make warrantless requests for info.

1372787632.0,118,self.restorethefourth,1hidxn,Creating a viral video to promote the cause,140,22,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hidxn/creating_a_viral_video_to_promote_the_cause/,"After commenting about it in the million man march thread, I figured I should probably just go about doing it.  Right now to me it feels like there isn't a lot (or at least enough) momentum in America to make a change.  There is a slow move towards wanting to do something, but by the time it gets anywhere the issue might have been long buried beneath the celebrity stories and whatever the latest blockbuster is.  Privacy is not something tangible and too many people won't give a second thought to the government spying.  Just the other day I heard someone say that Snowden should be killed for being a traitor and he is the scum of the earth.  People still think that the current government is the good guy, and anybody against it can fuck off.  They think that the government is America.  This needs to change.  But as it stands right now, unless something big happens soon, people aren't going to leave their screens.  So we need to take it to them in a way that can connect with a wide audience. 

The idea is to get a viral video made that highlights personal stories of how governments who spy on their citizens, similar to the [comment that was made when the leaks first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl?context=3).  If we can get people on camera and show how deeply this has affected them and everything that they lost because of it, it could help and have a huge impact. 

At the same time, the video can focus on abuses of power and the slow crawl towards tyranny that the US has been taking the last century.  Using things like [Dwight Eisenhower's speech warning about the military industrial complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y06NSBBRtY) taking over, and [JFK's speech against secret organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhZk8ronces).  Using that along with bringing up and sharing the ideals of the founding fathers that contradict what our government is doing today.  Basically, what we can show is that we know the what the government is doing is legal, but only because they made it so and the laws need to change.  The potential for abuse is there and even if they are not abusing it now, somebody will given enough time and we need to be protected against that.

So basically what I'm looking for is ideas on content and help from anyone who is good at making videos, so we can put together a team to get it made.  Ideally we could get it up by the 4th but I don't know if we can actually make that happen.  If there is anybody who wants to help we can start putting together ideas here, or PM me to coordinate further.  I have some video editing skills but it's all self taught and using mostly iMovie so if there is someone out there with a little more background in it that would be fantastic.

The key to this video being successful, however, is sources.  For everything we put in there we need to be able to back it up in the real world.  We need to be as transparent and open as possible about it, and if we sensationalize or make up things to get people to watch it then we lose all credibility. 

 So what can we do to make this a reality?

http://wsws.org/en/articles/2013/06/13/clap-j13.html

As to the media silence on this issue, it has to be pointed out that the election of Obama in 2008 provided the vehicle for broad sections of alleged ""liberals"" to move decisively to the right. Whereas once they opposed unconstitutional spying programs justified on the basis of endless wars, they now support these exact programs, amplified a hundred-fold by the current administration, on the basis that the person now carrying it out is a black democrat.

But of course, this is not enough to explain the political evolution of these people. The real issue here is the crisis of American capitalism over the better part of the past half century, which decline the wealthy and powerful have attempted to offset by ever-increasing militarism abroad and attacks on the living standards of people at home. They are extremely conscious that these policies cannot be carried out under traditional democratic norms. That is the secret behind the development of capitalism and the media that speaks for it over the last decade.

The experiences of the past two administrations confirm decisively: No confidence can be placed in either of the two major parties, comprised of flunkies of the banks and military-industrial complex!",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1gclbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1gclbp/also_unreported_by_the_media_top_obama/,

A lot of people discounted OWS as a bunch of lazy bums  because they were dressed casually, while the Tea Party has been ridiculed because of its overly patriotic costumes. Image is everything, so we should dress to impress.

----

In less than three days, we have grown from absolutely nothing to over 10,000 members! Protests are now being planned for more than fifty cities nationwide. Great job everyone, but we have only just started.

Now it is time for the next step. I have created a new subreddit called /r/rtforganizers (Restore The Fourth Organizers) on which every thread is a city, and the specific details for upcoming protests will be posted there. Further, people are encouraged to discuss upcoming protests within each city thread. 

We are going to be updating our current ""list of upcoming protests"" threads to link there instead. 

----

**Organizers:** Please find your city in the list, and reply with any details you have about the upcoming protests such as date and time, location, etc. If you do not yet have this worked out, then please tell us in that thread so that we can help. If you do not see your city listed, please contact me or any other moderator of /r/rtforganizers so that we can add that city. We will update the main text of each thread according to the comments posted.

**Participants:** Please find your city (or a city close to you) in the list of threads, and use the ""Reddit search"" function if needed (limit your search to /r/rtforganizers). If there is a confirmed protest, the details of that will be written in the main text of that thread. 

See the sidebar of that subreddit for additional information.

Also, feel free to use each city thread to discuss the details of that protest, ask questions, plan who is going to do what, etc. However, please do NOT use /r/rtforganizers for general discussion, that is what /r/restorethefourth is for.

This is not meant to detract from any other RTF subreddits, threads, or websites. This is simply a place where we can keep everything organized and make sure that we clearly state which protests are confirmed and to help those which are unconfirmed reach a confirmed status.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1370925349.0,,,True,t3_1g3k9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g3k9h/updated_list_of_all_upcoming_restore_the_fourth/,moderator
1371406546.0,108,self.restorethefourth,1ggrp7,"Just searched for ""NSA protest"" in all the online news sources: The only items there are for Hong Kong. Groups from this sub have been out publicly protesting. Where is the coverage?",125,17,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1ggrp7/just_searched_for_nsa_protest_in_all_the_online/,"As someone who marched in protest of the war in Vietnam (my friends kept coming home in body bags or with limbs missing, that motivated me), I'm happy to see some serious activism taking place to address the government's surveillance of US citizens.

But I'm wondering: Where's The Beef?  

I know some people from this sub have already publicly demonstrated.  Yet not a peep from the media.  It's clear the media is practically ignoring the entire NSA issue: the Obama/Benghazi scandal got far more coverage.  Is the lack a reflection of the general public's reaction - a simple and valid measure of how little people care?  Is there a media storm pending more official responses and hearings?  Or waiting for the 'further revelations' promised by Greenwald?  

Or is this, as I seriously fear, simply a non-issue for most Americans?  Is the majority of people's reaction ""yeah, we already knew that, big deal""?

I find the actions of the NSA, the other ""Security Agencies"", and the elected officials who oversee those agencies to be heinous, treasonous and vile beyond words.  The response should be that all those responsible should be held accountable, and removed from office and replaced if possible.  I know I'm not alone.  

We need to make ourselves heard.  We need to let the government know that this will not go away; that Americans *will not tolerate* a government that does not respect the Constitution.

I hope this movement grows.  I fear it will go the way of the Occupy movement, where the rules, guidelines, and Politically Correct Zero-Tolerance Nanny-State proponents grew to eclipse the founder's intent and passion.  Occupy is now so mainstreamed that it's trendy at posh conservative cocktail parties to drop that you volunteered to help the Occupy movement.  The Occupy subreddit has 2,028 members now.  Don't let Restore The Fourth take the path of least resistance.

Restore, I want to use this post to address two very important issues. 

First of these is the matter of deciding on the content of the ad - that includes the target audience, the purpose, the language, the graphics, and the branding. As you come up with ideas in this thread and decide on those you like best I will update the post with those best suited to the purpose.

Keep in mind that the sooner we all put this ad together, the sooner we can showcase it to other donors and give them a concrete idea of what we mean to accomplish. The media has done its best to ignore this issue and will not advertise it on its own dime. It's up to us to raise this money.  

I recognize we have a lot of crafty, creative, insightful, and knowledgeable individuals here. And some amongst us are experts in their field. If you have professional experience in a particular area of concern to this campaign, by all means share it. We need a **concise, coherent message that shows we've rolled up our sleeves, and we mean business.**

The second issue is the money raised. $100k is a serious chunk of change and I don't want there to be any hint of doubt in anyone's mind as to how those funds are being handled.

Please select amongst yourselves two independent, professionally certified accountants and put them in contact with me. I will work with them directly in managing these funds so that this legitimate concern does not become a distraction.

Thanks to everyone who came. Everyone there had something to contribute, which was freaking awesome to see. Special thanks to /u/analogkid01 for starting us out and getting the venue. Here's the notes I took from the meeting. Please comment if it looks like I got something wrong or missed anything.

The meeting was held from 7:00pm CST to 9:00pm June 19, 2013 at The Irish American Heritage Center. Topics were divided between how to contact your local congressman, group agreed upon issues to bring up with them, and organizing and logistics for Chicago's Restore the Fourth rally on July 4th.

Our message to our legislators should focus on rolling back. Scale back the NSA, patriot act, wiretapping, etc. Specifically:

    Roll back the patriot act.
    Discuss operational transparency regarding the NSA &amp; FISA.
    Remove the gag order on companies involved with the NSA.
    Remove immunity to legal actions for companies involved with the NSA.
    Add metadata to the kinds of data protected by the 4th amendment and define the steps and requirements for search and seizure.

The challenge lies in contacting congressional offices. Congress is on vacation starting July 1. Talk to them that week and try to arrange a face-to-face meeting. Put an APB on reddit, on the r4th Facebook page, and look for people who know of or work in the congressional offices.

Finally, our representatives are up for re-election in 2014. Let's replace them with people whose ideals match ours. Get redditors to support them and from there reach out non-redditors. Don’t just meet with our representatives, replace them.

Next we discussed planning for the Restore the Fourth rally:

Confirmed date:

    July 4th, 2013

Confirmed time:

    12:00 noon

Location:

    Daley Plaza, marching east to Michigan Ave, then marching North to Michigan / Chicago. We need to look up the plaza's schedule and see if our rally will coincide with any existing events.

Purpose:

    Educate the public on what the 4th amendment is, how our government is violating it, what it means for them, and what they can do to change it. We'll stop at points along the march to disperse and hand out literature, engage in public speaking, and engage the public one-on-one. After a set time we'll regroup and march to the next location. We may chant while marching, and we will have signs to draw attention to us. We will make a post on the r4Chciago Facebook page looking for speakers and other rally volunteers.

Dress code:

    Dress well, at least business casual.

Legality:

    We may not need a permit so long as we keep to the sidewalks and do not block the roads. We may not need a permit to gather at Daley Plaza. The ACLU has a page that describes protest action legalities. We should find the Chicago one.

Relationship with the national movement:

    /u/NoUrImmature has volunteered to be Chicago's general and media point of contact.

Social/Internet Media:

    A simple website will be constructed with our mission statement, demands, and links to social media will be constructed. Kevin is researching domain name availability.
    Kevin is researching if it's possible to attain the URLs chicago.restorethefourth.net or www.restoretheforuth.net/chicago
    Kevin is researching the feasibility of attaining the email address chicago@restorethefourth.net for official communication. We'll use rtfchicago@gmail.com as a fallback.
    https://www.facebook.com/RTFChicago will contain primary info for the general public, photos, flyers, events, etc. Please like this page, and like+share its posts.
    Kevin and Shawn will begin to use @RTFChicago. Please follow it and retweet if you use Twitter.
    /r/r4Chicago will be used to plan rally logistics.
    Kevin will update Chicago's entry at www.restorethefourth.net/protests

Flyers:

    Paul works at a marketing company and knows some designers who may make flyers for us.
    Please post flyers you make to /r/r4Chicago. Official ones will go in a Facebook photo album.

Media:

    Contact your local TV, radio, news, and other media. Say who we are, what our rally is about, and drop our email address as a point of contact for more information.

Local Outreach:

    Ask to speak at local political and social meetings. Speak about us and our rally. Hand out flyers if possible.
    Insist that those from other political groups who participate know they are participating in a Restore the Fourth event. We remain non-partisan.
    ""Guerrilla marketing"" tactics are fine so long as they are legal.

Miscellaneous:

    The event on July 4th is not a ""protest"". It is a ""rally"".
    Please know the 4th amendment by heart and keep up to date on talking points.
    Paul is setting up a wepay account so we can pool resources to pay for materials and incidentals.

Next Meting:

    Next Thursday June 28. /u/analogkid01 is researching using Harold Public Library with the Next-Door Cafe as a fallback. Full announcement TBA.

By Laura K. Donohue, Published: June 21

*Laura K. Donohue is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and director of Georgetown’s Center on National Security and the Law.*

The National Security Agency’s recently revealed surveillance programs undermine the purpose of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was established to prevent this kind of overreach. They violate the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. And they underscore the dangers of growing executive power.

The intelligence community has a history of overreaching in the name of national security. In the mid-1970s, it came to light that, since the 1940s, the NSA had been collecting international telegraphic traffic from companies, in the process obtaining millions of Americans’ telegrams that were unrelated to foreign targets. From 1940 to 1973, the CIA and the FBI engaged in covert mail-opening programs that violated laws prohibiting the interception or opening of mail. The agencies also conducted warrantless “surreptitious entries,” breaking into targets’ offices and homes to photocopy or steal business records and personal documents. The Army Security Agency intercepted domestic radio communications. And the Army’s CONUS program placed more than 100,000 people under surveillance, including lawmakers and civil rights leaders.

After an extensive investigation of the agencies’ actions, Congress passed the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to limit sweeping collection of intelligence and create rigorous oversight. But 35 years later, the NSA is using this law and its subsequent amendments as legal grounds to run even more invasive programs than those that gave rise to the statute.

We’ve learned that in April, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) ordered Verizon to provide information on calls made by each subscriber over a three-month period. Over the past seven years, similar orders have been served continuously on AT&amp;T, Sprint and other telecommunications providers.

Another program, PRISM, disclosed by the Guardian and The Washington Post, allows the NSA and the FBI to obtain online data including e-mails, photographs, documents and connection logs. The information that can be assembledabout any one person — much less organizations, social networks and entire communities — is staggering: What we do, think and believe.

The government defends the programs’ legality, saying they comply with FISA and its amendments. It may be right, but only because FISA has ceased to provide a meaningful constraint.

Under the traditional FISA, if the government wants to conduct electronic surveillance, it must make a classified application to a special court, identitying or describing the target. It must demonstrate probable cause that the target is a foreign power or an agent thereof, and that the facilities to be monitored will be used by the target.

In 2008, Congress added section 702 to the statute, allowing the government to use electronic surveillance to collect foreign intelligence on non-U.S. persons it reasonably believes are abroad, without a court order for each target. A U.S. citizen may not intentionally be targeted.

To the extent that the FISC sanctioned PRISM, it may be consistent with the law. But it is disingenuous to suggest that millions of Americans’ e-mails, photographs and documents are “incidental” to an investigation targeting foreigners overseas.

The telephony metadata program raises similar concerns. FISA did not originally envision the government accessing records. Following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Congress allowed applications for obtaining records from certain kinds of businesses. In 2001, lawmakers further expanded FISA to give the government access to any business or personal records. Under section 215 of the Patriot Act, the government no longer has to prove that the target is a foreign power. It need only state that the records are sought as part of an investigation to protect against terrorism or clandestine intelligence.

This means that FISA can now be used to gather records concerning individuals who are neither the target of any investigation nor an agent of a foreign power. Entire databases — such as telephony metadata — can be obtained, as long as an authorized investigation exists.

Congress didn’t pass Section 215 to allow for the wholesale collection of information. As Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), who helped draft the statute, wrote in the Guardian: “Congress intended to allow the intelligence communities to access targeted information for specific investigations. How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?”

As a constitutional matter, the Supreme Court has long held that, where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy, search and seizure may occur only once the government has obtained a warrant, supported by probable cause and issued by a judge. The warrant must specify the places to be searched and items to be seized.

There are exceptions to the warrant requirement. In 1979 the court held that the use of a pen register to record numbers dialed from someone’s home was not a search. The court suggested that people who disclose their communications to others assume the risk that law enforcement may obtain the information.

More than three decades later, digitization and the explosion of social-network technology have changed the calculus. In the ordinary course of life, third parties obtain massive amounts of information about us that, when analyzed, have much deeper implications for our privacy than before.

As for Section 702 of FISA, the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not protect foreigners from searches conducted abroad. But it has never recognized a foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement when foreign-targeted searches result in the collection of vast stores of citizens’ communications.

Americans reasonably expect that their movements, communications and decisions will not be recorded and analyzed by the government. A majority of the Supreme Court seems to agree. Last year, the court considered a case involving 28-day GPS surveillance. Justice Samuel Alito suggested that in most criminal investigations, long-term monitoring “impinges on expectations of privacy.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor recognized that following a person’s movements “reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.”

The FISC is supposed to operate as a check. But it is a secret court, notorious for its low rate of denial. From 1979 to 2002, it did not reject a single application. Over the past five years, out of nearly 8,600 applications, only two have been denied.

Congress has an opportunity to create more effective checks on executive power. It could withdraw Sections 215 and 702 and introduce new measures to regulate intelligence collection and analysis. There are many options.

James Madison put it best: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1gvfkp,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1gvfkp/georgetown_law_professornsa_surveillance_may_be/,

Edit2: Any suggestions that you think would make the G+ event even better are welcome!

Okay so this is my first thread here, so I appreciate any and all feedback.

I know we're just getting started, a website is in the works, and organizers in their own communities will be and are setting up events for RestoreTheFourth, but as I've been scouring Google+ and other social networks, I've noticed a number of people who want to know what they can do next. I've mentioned in a few threads that ""#restorethefourth is coming,"" but I know that the memory and attention span of the general public is rather short. 

For this reason, I think it would be wise to create a nationwide (not to replace local gatherings, but as a ""reminder""event) RestoreTheFourth event on G+ and Facebook as soon as possible for those who aren't Redditors (such as myself before now). This will not only get it on the minds of the people, but also on their calendars (in addition to the holiday). It will allow us to spread the word, portray our message of peaceful protest, answer questions, and hopefully maintain traction and gain momentum (and trending) for the next 24 days.

As the website comes, and other support structures come online, we can add them to the nationwide G+/FB event and further bolster support for those things (Indiegogo campaign for NYT ad, Whitehouse petition for Snowden's pardon, etc).

I did some searching and couldn't find a nationwide version of this event on social networks other than Reddit, but if I missed them, please let me know. Remember, this is not to replace your local movements, again this is just overall awareness for other social networks and users who may not frequent Reddit.

With some community approval, and given that the nationwide versions of these events haven't been created yet or someone better qualified is able to do so, I volunteer to do so using materials from this subreddit. Thoughts?

If Snowden's allegations are true, then the actions of the U.S. government represent an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither. If we defeat terrorists at the cost of our own freedom, then it is not worth it.

Snowden is a hero who sacrificed everything so that the American people could know the truth. Instead of charging him with espionage, we should take his allegations of government espionage seriously.

In addition to a full pardon for Snowden, we call for a full investigation into the constitutionality of NSA wiretapping under the PRISM program.

As most of you know, we had been having daily meetings every night in the IRC channel #restorethefourth.


However, since that meeting time had been established, our movement's community has continued to grow to be very populated, and we feel it would be best to hold the meetings in the subreddit, to ensure that everyone is getting the most that they can out of the meetings.


We also made a post a few days ago regarding a draft of new rule changes, if you'd like to see them, click [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1glx8a/proposal_for_rule_changes_and_clarifications/)


**So, first on tonight's agenda is marketing. Here's a note from the marketing director:**


I will be almost entirely be away from internet access for the next two days (personal reasons) I will have cell reception, and veryoriginal78 has my cell phone number if the need arise.


She has a lot on her plate, and with me gone marketing has literally no organization beyond this sub, but this is why I created it. If you can handle something yourself, please do so. If not, please be patient.


The daily tasks required:


---Scan /r/restorethefourth for all marketing related ideas.

forward someone in their direction if they need help. Designers, writers, etc.


---Write a short report and post it in this thread. Keep it updated with whatever most recent information you can. (Who's working on what, their expected completion day/time, and what is needed next to get it done.)


---Scan youtube, google, and facebook analytics for the most recent trending artwork. If something isn't popular, figure out why and report it.


---Coordinate between the national organization and the designers. Make sure only final copies get distributed, and all wording is up to par.


---Make sure everyone feels appreciated. It's not ""marketing's"" work. It's the designers, the writers, the individual team members. Give credit where credit is due.


**Up next in the agenda is a PR update:**


---PR is currently creating a templated press release, and materials for help with talking to the media.


---TheBlaze article should go live tomorrow


---and possibly mashable


---our press release was distributed to over 3,700 media outlets 


---We were also in a TIME magazine web article
◦
(http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/20/privacy-rights-groups-struggle-to-capture-congressional-attention/)



**And lastly, an important post regarding Thunderclap, from /u/astrawnomore**


You can find the Thunderclap information [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZktXUVhZ-RVxrN9fDXmGINlOfx3XnoSCIE9A33EKYEg/)

I want input on the following things:

---Does the content fit our movement?

---When should the deadline be for the Thunderclap?

---Can we get this upvoted on reddit for visibility?

However as someone observing this movement, I feel that at the end of the day this will just be washed away as the tide rolls out for various reasons:
 
This movement is asking the same repressive government that is encroaching on these rights to restore them. Unless you can make yourselves something to be reckoned with, something that the ruling elites will actually fear, I have VERY little hope they'll listen. Why should they? You have to have some sort of leverage here, something that will actually make the ruling class listen.

The ruling class benefits from a very powerful thing. They control society's productivity, they control society's productive tools. This is what amasses them their wealth. They own the banks, the factories, the media, the workplace, *they appropriate the economic output of working people*. What is the best way to shake them then? A strike of course! Now is restorethefourth going to do that, I dunno, but hear me out. Society withholding it's labor means that the profits of the capitalist class who controls the country also are at a standstill. If working people decide to appropriate that wealth for themselves, this seriously scares the ruling class. Now the labor movement is quite fragmented and weak at this time, so that's probably a tactic beyond the scope of this movement at this time, but that's something you should consider in the future.
 
Now you'll say to me, ""Oh that's impossible you utopian twat, it's just easier to contact our elected officials, they represent us of course!"" However, aside from a few special exceptions who will find this to be a great opportunity to put themselves in a good light, or a few naive politicians who thought they really could fight the system from within when they were elected, the politicians don't represent us. Politicians aren't going to fight against this, because this spying program is an AMAZING tool for the ruling class. Just think, if they want to keep the populace in check they have all the info about who these people are right at their very fingertips, why would they want to get rid of that. The government can keep tabs on anyone they want with this, they aren't going to give it up willingly.

In order to shake the institutions that control society it's necessary to call into question the system that gives them power, capitalism, and unless this movement does that, it's not really going to get very far. Especially if it's just a one off protest that doesn't keep escalating it's demands.

Also, because reddit is predominantly middle-class white folks, I'm sure there will be plenty of pro-capitalist people coming in here to shout at me that we don't have real capitalism or blah blah blah, free markets are the only true liberty, etc, etc, but whether or not we have ""true capitalism"" or not doesn't matter, because what we have now must be called into question and fought against regardless.

As a fellow traveler wishing for a better world though, good luck. I do hope you surprise me and actually end up making a big stink that makes the government quiver with fear.

Thank you for contacting me about the National Security Agency (NSA). I appreciate the opportunity to respond.
 
I have recently attended classified hearings and briefings about NSA activities, and I have been shocked to learn of the wholesale level of eavesdropping. I intend to find out the justification for such massive monitoring. Top level government officials – experts in national security – have indicated that numerous terrorist plots have been foiled. That's the good news. We need to keep our country safe, but our privacy also has to be protected. It's a difficult balance, and this vigorous public debate is important and necessary.

Thanks to the heroic actions of people like Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, the secretive actions of the US government and Obama administration have been made public. But, Obama's justice department continues to imprison Manning and threaten Snowden with the same.

We need to get the story linked below out there. People are mad, let's work with this opportunity the government gave us to fight while we still can and make it clear that as Americans, we will not falter, we will not forget, we will demand that we are granted the rights we were taught about in schools since birth.

Do not stop pushing.",86,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1k1zol/obamas_pledge_to_reform_domestic_spying_is/,"Today Obama had a press conference announcing what he referred to as reforms. The promises were vague and nothing more than by-the-book damage control.

First they ignore the issue and hope it'll go away. Then they acknowledge it but downplay the significance. Then they try to marginalize the petitioners and paint them as a fringe group. Then they offer empty, conciliatory promises that have the appearance of a compromise, but don't actually address the underlying issue. Then they bow down and submit to real reforms. Then you win.

We're on the conciliatory promise stage. Obama hopes this doublespeak will make those pesky American citizens just shut up. He doesn't even think that the surveillance programs are a problem! He's only acknowledged that it's a problem that we don't trust them as he does, and his ""reforms"" are designed to gain public support, not change the real problem.

We need to push twice as hard, because this is the first sign that things can change. One man doesn't get to decide the operation of this country, the people do. We need to make that clear, and the final decision to neuter the NSA and repeal the PATRIOT act will be out of his hands.

* Organizing

* wondering what to wear


* Un informed



 We do not need to raise funds for protesting. Just print off your own flyers and bring your own camera/phone. We DO NOT need a special force just for taking pictures. Everybody needs to. There is to much attention to detail in this subreddit. No dress code. 

For Protesting:

Step one: make sure people KNOW WHEN IT IS. Emphasize that a lot.



Get their signatures that they are promising to come.



Step two(or part of one): make sure you and the other protestors KNOW



WHAT YOUR PROTESTING ABOUT.




Step three: constantly (but not constantly to the point of annoyance)




send out updates as to how you are doing an how this will help and what




the mission statement it. And it kinda rallies them together. If the




protest is a long time away then it reminds them. (maybe once a week?




Twice MAYBE)




Step four: when conducting the protest make sure it's NON VOILENT that




will help the protesters safety, make a point on the cause and get some




style points with the cops.




Step five: after the protest, send out a message to all of the people who




participated saying thanks and it was a help ect.. Try organizing another




even bigger one.




Some tips: try toget the news to report what your doing BUT make sure




they fully understand what your doing. Or you could be smeared.





Get lots of video of what's going on before, during, after protest and




upload it to YouTube, Dropbox, other places to show that if anything




happened it was the cops fault. (they usually instigate things)




And REMEBER: Stay safe




Be passionate




NON VIOLENT



We need to have people knowing when things are. The more people who know the more people that will show. It will be tough getting them out because the main stream media is downplaying and not even reporting protests. I don't trust the Main Stream Media anymore. Something is very wrong here.

We are NOT the Tea Party!",104,29,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hn5xs/salt_lake_protest_you_disappoint_we_are_not_the/,"I just came back from the Salt Lake City protest outside of the NSA data center. I am very disappointed with what happened and how it was handled on our part.

First off, we were kicked out of the area in front of the NSA facility as the Camp Williams commander claimed the side of the road as the property of Camp Williams (I just did a FOIA request for the boundaries of Camp Williams, so we will see if that's factual). The protesters reacted quickly and moved down the road to a public area across the street from the camp, which was great thinking. 

I arrived and was excited as there seemed to be a good turn out (including state police, but they were there for a slightly different reason). When I arrived at the secondary location there was a public speaker with a PA system. I was there for about a minute and a half and was immediately alienated. Here are a few, some paraphrased, exerts from his speech.

The NSA was made by the devil.

This is happening because we have left god and are no longer a Christian nation.

The only way to end this is to turn to god and repent.

Only belief and acceptance of Jesus Christ can end this.

God brought us all together for a greater cause.

He read a passage, Corinthians if I remember correctly, from his bible.

After the passage he asked all those who believed his statement to raise their hands. (I must add that about a fourth of us did not raise our hands.)

Immediately following he said, ""Regardless of your belief kneel down, and take your neighbors hands, and let us pray.""

There was talk about Obama being a ""migrant"". I'm not sure if this came from him, or where it came from. But it was not on the topic of the NSA.

He talked about his business and cleaning up messes in hotels, feces spread on the walls, HIV cleanups, bio-hazard cleanups, etc. (I could see where he was going with it by trying, and failing, to link his cleanup experience to cleaning up the NSA. He failed, miserably)

I can go on, but I won't, you get the idea. Immediately after he asked us to kneel down, which again, a good fourth of us did not, several protesters left! I was there for a grand total of five minutes before I left due to the absurdity. 

I understand a lot of this was planned last minute and within a week, but common sense must prevail. Talking about personal gods and religious affiliation in the manner the speaker did will, and did, alienate people. It will also make us look like religious lunatics and we will never be taken seriously.

We need to screen the public speakers that the organizers invite so we don't alienate support! I am not asking to infringe on 1st Amendment rights; people can say what they want. I am simply saying we need to ensure our public speakers remain on topic, on point and don't alienate support.

His speech reminded me of Tea Party speeches. According to this subreddit, we are not affiliated with the Tea Party or OWS.

This protest was absurd and an embarrassment to the organization. We need to ensure we stay on topic about the NSA, keep the protests focused to the subject at hand. If people want to infer that satan is the cause of the NSA spying on us, fine, that's dandy. Just keep it out of the main speeches so we don't alienate our support. I will be very surprised if I attend another protest because of this fiasco and blatant proselytizing.

The 4th is a day of true patriotism and there is no truer patriotism than protest.

They will not take our 4th amendment rights from us and they will not take our 2nd amendment rights from us.  This government is supposed to be BY the people, FOR the people and OF the people.

Whether we like it or not, many of us will have to get permits to do this, and won't be able to gather enough of our friends and family to protest alongside us and get a permit by July 4th.

2. July 4th is a national holiday. The media will have their broadcasting for this day planned well in advance, and the only thing that they will really make room for outside of their ""recipe"" is ""breaking news"", which we will not be unless millions of us came out of nowhere.

3. Even though this issue is incredibly important and could very likely be another checkpoint on America's journey into something incredibly frightening, at this point in time, ""the average American"" is relatively unaware of the far-reaching consequences and foreshadowing of these recent US policy revelations, and will be far more interested in consuming alcoholic beverages and playing with fireworks than they will be in engaging in protests against the government. This is especially true in situations where Americans have children and would rather spend the holiday with them.


Additionally, I believe that the most powerful way for us to send a message is to apply for permits all across the country well in advance, where permissible, and then, suddenly, simultaneously, take to the streets. 

I believe that those of us in small towns are particularly fortunate in that we can manufacture close relationships with our local media and get coverage in the small papers first. I know, for instance, in the town I live in, I could easily get my local paper to run, as a headline, ""'Restore the fourth': Protests in Portland this weekend in response to concerns US is headed toward authoritarianism""

My stance on this issue is not concrete; I am open to arguments against my view on this. We need to do what is best for the potential success of this movement, but I believe that doing this on July 4th is simply too soon and that we won't have the critical mass necessary to pull new people into the protests.


And again, I've said this many times before in this subreddit: When we *do* get new people to protest, we have to be absolutely sure that they will recite only our message to the media, and that they will not throw in their own editorialized version of our message, or add things like ""And I mean like, why isn't our government like, letting us smoke marijuana if we want to? I mean, what is this? North Korea?""

This is difficult, since the average person has little to no influence in a candidate's fundraising efforts.  As such, candidates MUST make promises to people and organizations with big pockets, especially early in a campaign.

Representative John Sarbanes (D-MD) said this a few months ago: ""We're professional fund raisers first, and professional congressmen second.""

Dear Congressman/woman [my congressperson]:


I'm writing to you regarding the recent revelation that the NSA has been operating clandestine, warrantless surveillance of Americans' phone conversations, private communications, and the data they access with their computers.

As one of your constituents I urge you to strongly oppose this surveillance, publicly call for an investigation into the true nature of the NSA's secretive actions, and demand accountability from the officials who endorsed it. 

I believe this surveillance of Americans' private data without a warrant is a flagrant violation of our Constitutional rights as well as the other laws of this country. I urge you to do everything in your power as my elected representative to protect my rights and those of my fellow citizens, as well as to push for a government that fairly represents the best interests of its people, and does so with transparency and honesty. 

I look forward to hearing your stance on this critical civil rights issue.

Sincerely,

Feinstein, Obama, and others were wiretapped by the NSA",62,11,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1iudim/nsa_whistleblower_russell_tice_claims_sen/,"I am shocked [this story](http://www.peterbcollins.com/2013/07/15/nsa-whistleblower-russell-tice-offers-more-details-sen-feinstein-and-others-were-wiretapped-by-nsa/) has not had more attention. 

Think about the implications of this: If the NSA is wire tapping elected officials under the Patriot Act, and tracking all of their online activity (including their families) this suddenly explains all the support the NSA is getting from our elected officials. It also explains the radical shifts in ideology that we have seen from many of our elected officials including Senator Feinstein, and even Obama in support of these programs.

According to a recent [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/all/), Keith Alexander the Director of the National Security Agency, Chief of the Central Security Service and Commander of the United States Cyber Command, as well as a four-star general in the United States Army has a personal cyber army and literal military at his disposal, including the keys to all of our cyber security infrastructure and has dirt on literally the entire planet. This guy is potentially the most powerful man in the world right now.

From Wired:
&gt;""We jokingly referred to him as Emperor Alexander—with good cause, because whatever Keith wants, Keith gets,” says one former senior CIA official who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “We would sit back literally in awe of what he was able to get from Congress, from the White House, and at the expense of everybody else.”

Essentially the NSA is in a position to blackmail elected officials, and CEOs and executives of major corporations such as those in the PRISM program into getting whatever they want. This would mean that not only are our elected officials and executives being kept in the dark about what is going on with the NSA, but they themselves are victims of the same surveillance programs.

Even Apple was forced into the PRISM program after Steve Jobs death, a company who at its very core is opposed to Big Brother.

&gt; None of the judges of the FISA court were vetted by Congress. They were appointed by a single unelected official: John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court. And then there's the fact that ""the FISA court hears from only one side in the case—the government—and its findings are almost never made public."" A court that is supreme, in the sense of having the final say, but where arguments are only ever submitted on behalf of the government, and whose judges are not subject to the approval of a democratic body, sounds a lot like the sort of thing authoritarian governments set up when they make a half-hearted attempt to create the appearance of the rule of law.

We'll make sure everyone on the committee sees any feedback left here.

If you're the main point of contact for your area and you didn't get this email please let organizing@restorethefourth.net know and we will add you to the local organizer mailing list.

Dear Local Organizers,
 
As you may know, Restore the Fourth's national organization ended up being run by a board of about six people, some representing a local organization and some not, but is now transitioning towards a new structure that is more transparent and better integrates local organizers in general.
 
The next step in this transition is the formation of a committee of 15 members that will have the responsibility of determining the long-term structure of Restore the Fourth. This committee will be made up of the six individuals that currently serve as the national organization's board as well as nine additional local organizers from different cities that took part in July 4th's protests. The purpose of this email, in addition to updating all of you, is to find the nine local organizers that will form this committee with us.
 
If you intend to continue to organize future Restore the Fourth events or consider yourself the best current representative of those in your area who might, please respond indicating such to make yourself eligible to participate in this committee. If you aren't sure who would best represent your chapter, or suspect the individual that would didn't get this email, please determine and locate that person and have him/her get back to us as soon as possible.
 
To be eligible to represent a local chapter in this committee, you must:

- let us know, if you haven't already, your full name, an email you check regularly, and a phone number we can contact you at. Your phone number will never be made public.

- be willing to have your full name, accompanied by an email you check regularly, listed publicly as a representative of your local Restore the Fourth chapter; we recommend making and regularly checking one like ""rt4(city)@gmail.com"" if you haven't yet.

- have at least several hours to spend over the next week to take part in discussing, advising, and ultimately voting on this committee’s work.

- represent a city that successfully staged an active protest on July 4th. If you haven’t sent photos and/or participation estimates to socialmedia@restorethefourth.net or organizing@restorethefourth.net, please do so now.

- be committed to Restore the Fourth’s basic principles of: defending the Fourth Amendment, particularly in terms of search and surveillance; remaining non-violent; and remaining independent and non-partisan.

Over the course of this weekend, we will invite those qualified and interested whose cities staged the most successful protests on the 4th to join this committee, via an email invite to the discussion system it will be using. We will also request your input on our ongoing projects and on updating the public on them.
 
Here are some of the questions this committee will need to address...

- What will be the ultimate decision-making body for Restore the Fourth National? Which members of the committee will be part of it (or will all be? or all and more? etc.) By what criteria will its members be determined?

- What other official national organization bodies (whether a part of, separate from, or overlapping with the above) should exist?

- How frequently will each meet, how will each communicate, and what will each’s function be?

- What will the relationship be between these bodies and local chapters, and what will the criteria for inclusion as an official local chapter be? How can we improve dialogue with local chapters?

This committee will aim to reach a consensus on these four questions by Thursday July 18th. If no consensus is reached by Sunday July 21st, the committee will vote that afternoon and whichever system has majority or even plurality support will be used. Further changes to our structure can be made via whatever body is put in place by this committee, shortly after if necessary, but some formal decision-making body - with a publicly available list of members and rules - must be announced by this committee on this schedule.
 
All local organizers are encouraged to respond to this email with thoughts on how we move forward structurally, especially if you expect you and your city won’t be on this committee. These replies and other feedback you've given us (e.g. the responses to Saturday’s email) will be carefully indexed for consideration, and we’ll do our best to keep you updated over the course of this week. We look forward to talking to all of you, and opening up more effective ways of doing so.

Thank you for your patience and hard work,

Having a camera that can record is common. It would be an effective tactic if groups of protesters picked out government workers (police, politicians, administration, diplomats - it doesn't matter, but the higher profile the better) and record them publicly and non-stop for as long as possible in both work and play. Also stand outside government buildings and film the entrances and exits non-stop. Edit and submit anything interesting to youTube. Do this in large groups and for as long as possible. Make it uncomfortable whenever possible. You could follow police cars around reporting there every move. You could also record what government officials and politicians eat for lunch and what coffee they are drinking and all kinds of annoying details and see how they like it. Anything protesters can do to turn the tables I think would be effective and illumininating.

I think it's important to make the people in the government experience the annoyance and self-censorship of surveillance and for the general public to see and experience a protest method that is to the point. We need to illustrate the chilling and horrible effect that living in a surveillance state has on the quality of life and make the other side experience it.

His words were meant to discourage, but now I am more serious about this then ever and I am taking action today. I will be posting flyers everywhere because thats the only thing I know I can do besides spreading the word via social media. 
The reason I have posted this is to remind us all that this is a real cause. It isn't something to be ignored. People will tell you that we will change nothing. All I can say is unlike the rest of the complacent Americans at least I stood up for my rights and I will not back down.

""Part of the American dream is to live long and die young. Only those Americans who are willing to die for their country are fit to live.""-Douglas MacArthur



So we have run into a small problem here. We are organizing protests and trying to spread the word when this can take months, and by then all of this will be out of the news and forgotten. 

I was thinking of how to quickly spread the word. So kony 2012 had 100K views in 3 days. They had celebrates tweeting and facebooking about the video. They had the video and word spread like a wildfire. 

So here is what I suggest:
Tweet to major technology celebrities and ask(kindly) to retweet it.
Same thing with facebook


If you are up to spending maybe just half an hour to tweet/facebooking to celebrities it can make a difference.
Here is what I sugguest tweeting/facebooking:
""Together we can stop domestic spying. Visit /r/Restorethefourth.""



or ""Customized tweet #Restorethe4th""
Or something to that effect.



***---VIDEO MAKERS***

we need ya! Take a look on the intro for Kony 2012. Look how it grabs your attention and does not make you want to close out. It does not have that annoying heavy metal, creepy, scary music playing in the intro.

Please make a video that is well put together.


***---Protesting***



In this subreddit, we only have 13K subscribers. We need more to organize a protest. 13K is a small number for a protest. We need MORE. Tweet and facebook celebrities (related to technology,hacking,ect../and the everyday celebrities too). 


_______________________________________-----PROTESTING-----_______________________________________


 Step one: make sure people KNOW WHEN IT IS. Emphasize that a lot.



Get their signatures that they are promising to come.



Step two(or part of one): make sure you and the other protestors KNOW



WHAT YOUR PROTESTING ABOUT.



Step three: constantly (but not constantly to the point of annoyance)



send out updates as to how you are doing an how this will help and what



the mission statement it. And it kinda rallies them together. If the



protest is a long time away then it reminds them. (maybe once a week?



Twice MAYBE)



Step four: when conducting the protest make sure it's NON VOILENT that



will help the protesters safety, make a point on the cause and get some



style points with the cops.



Step five: after the protest, send out a message to all of the people who



participated saying thanks and it was a help ect.. Try organizing another



even bigger one.



Some tips: try toget the news to report what your doing BUT make sure



they fully understand what your doing. Or you could be smeared.



Get lots of video of what's going on before, during, after protest and



upload it to YouTube, Dropbox, other places to show that if anything


happened it was the cops fault. (they usually instigate things)



And REMEBER: Stay safe


Be passionate



NON VIOLENT



***PROGRAMMERS***

We need a official website. This subreddit wont do as one. It gets cluttered up with random, un-needed things. If you have a good website for this, please reply to this post with the URL. If there are non, then can somebody please make one. PLease have it look:


* Professional


* Well done


* Crisp, Clean, Sharp



* Not cluttered



* Easy to read


* Include visuals, but not an overwhelming amount


* Mobile friendly

---Current websites---



* https://www.Restorethefourth.net

***Help with staying safe***



Here is a compiled list of ways to stay safe, DOES NOT MEAN YOUR DATA WILL NOT BE CAPTURED BY THE NSA. it just will protect you from the other 7Billion people. The NSA goes directly to the ISP, not your computer.
Here it is:



* Use Bitcoin over Tor




* Have a specific machine which you boot with a lived CD such as Tails of 


lunix with the HDD removed



* Use public wifi and sit out of view of the cameras



* Set up a PO Box with a fake name and have all your mail go through that



* Register a small company and sell your house to yourself so it is all under the company's details (a bit extreme I know)



* Set up your own mail server and secure it.(Hard)



* Use the Tor browser bundle



* Use email encryption (gpg)



* Use Off The Record instant messaging



* Install a lunix distro use full disk encryption( most of them have it built into the installer these days)



* Use a disposable debit card with a fake name



* Sign up to services with details e.g. amazon, netflix act



* Make use of 12p and or Tor for hosting your own website



* Make use of freenet



* Use i2p for torrents



* Pay by cash



* Support the organizations the stand up for your rights (FSF,EFF,EPIC,ACLU, TorProject ect)



* Pay attention to the attack on privacy



* Share what you lean with others



* Move away from hotmail,gmail,yahoo,aol, and choose a provider outside of the US.



* Delete Facebook, twitter ect



* Set all your profiles to private.



* Try to avoid real details where ever possible



* Turn off Geolocation in your browser.



* Use a fake Email whenever you sign up for apps and things like that



* Shred letters with your personal details on them



* If you insist on having a Facebook, have a Facbook only browser



* Use startpage/ixquick or duckduckgo as your search engine



* Cover or disconnect your webcam when not in use.



* Try not to tag yourself in pictures



* find a no-log VPN



* Use truecrypt as much as possible/File Vault for Mac



* Get some SED (self encrypting drives) - Flash-Drives (Kingston etc.)



* SSD-Drives (Samsung etc.)



* HD-Drives (WD, Hitachi, Toshiba etc.)



* Make sure that you modify the BIOS so that nothing llike a flashdrive can be booted up during the computers booting up process



* Never use your system password outside of your system (protects against key logging)



* It is advised to use a WIRED LAN that a WLAN



* Do daily scans for rootkits



* Use DNScript



* Use HTTPS everywhere (or type https://....)



* Try out I2P and Freenet



* Don’t forget about proxies!



* Use a VPN in other countries (use a proxy and https everywhere(addon) when using a VPN))



* Use gpg/enigmail when mailing people(only works if they reply with encrypted messages too, or its not going to work AT ALL)



* Find a disposable mail address(not Gmail or Yahoo mail)



* Use a 18+ random character password with special keys



* Use a live cd (already mentioned) with tails(cant work if you modify the BIOS)



* Use silent Circle(costs some money) for calling and texting



* Don’t forget about DuckDuckgo.com


***----ADS!***

So we all need to find a way to get a 1-2 second ad in to the Nightly News. Like NBC. It would be the image of the NSA like meme like 


Always

""NSA LOGO""

Watching




Alright please help out, post, tweet, Facebook. We cant do anything until we have TONS of people behind us. Its like putting the cart before the horse. You just dont do that.

----

On June 6th, Edward Snowden revealed the egregious miscarriage of justice that is currently taking place against not only the citizens of the United States of America, but the citizens of the world. We learned, to our shock and horror, that what we thought were our private communications were in fact being monitored by federal agents without our knowledge or consent. 

We learned that this monitoring was applied not only to suspected criminals, but to every law abiding American citizen, and even to citizens of other countries. We also learned that many of our own elected members of congress claim to have not known the full scale of these operations. Even now we have absolutely no idea just how deeply this unconstitutional surveillance extends into what remains of our private lives.

We cannot sit idly by while this is going on. We refuse to live in a world where everything we say and everywhere we go could be being monitored. We refuse to watch the country we love become hijacked by individuals who feel they can simply rewrite our constitution to meet their goals; who require us to ""rethink"" our fourth amendment rights. We refuse to accept that someone, somewhere could be monitoring our phone calls, emails, text messages, and other communications we make with our friends and loved ones. We refuse to live in fear, and we refuse to live in subjugation to a government that has forgotten its place. 

Therefore, on June 8th, we started the ""Restore the Fourth"" movement, so named due to our desire to restore our fourth amendment rights. At the time of this press release, only 2 days later, we are ten thousand strong. We have so far planned peaceful protests in over fifty cities around the country, although we expect that number to increase substantially.

We come from all across the political spectrum. We count republicans and democrats, conservatives and liberals among our group. We are young and old, rich and poor. What unites
us to our common purpose is this: We believe that the right to be secure in our persons against unlawful search and seizure is a fundamental human right; one which cannot and
should not be violated.

We demand the following:

1. By exercising our right to vote and peacefully protest, the removal from office of any official in government who acted against our fourth amendment rights. No apologies, no amends, simply removal from office.

2. Repeal the patriot act and other similar laws. If our currently elected representatives will not do so (highly unlikely), than we shall in the course of time elect those who will.

3. The implementation of a transparent government which respects the fourth amendment and represents the interests of the people of the United States of America.

There are now 205 Congress men and women that are publicly on record as opposing a bureaucratic program that has the potential to blackmail those same members of Congress.

Even if no one in the NSA acts on these thoughts now, I guarantee that the thought of compiling data on the members of Congress that voted for the Amash amendment crossed a few of the minds of the NSA bureaucrats.  They'll think of it as getting some leverage.  They might dismiss it outright, but come back to it someday when testing the system.  'Let's just run this test on Congressman Amash, or  maybe a couple of these guys.'  So something a little fishy comes up - a pattern that indicates a hidden email account, something like happened to Petraeus.  So they pursue, find no security threat, but now they have something politically embarrassing.  They have leverage in the next vote. They promise themselves never to use it, but it is always there in the backs of their minds.

This may actually have happened already.  How do we know that the entirety of the Congressional votes against the Amash amendment are untainted? Both the President and the Vice-President were adamant opponents of meta-data collection prior to taking office.  Yet they changed into ardent supporters once they took office.  Was this just the normal change of perspective that comes with assuming responsibility?  Or has the NSA followed in the footsteps of J Edgar Hoover and made certain provisions that their bureaucratic asses and pet programs are 'protected' against political interference?

That is one of the insidious characteristics of  PRISM. And the thing is, it has happened before with J Edgar Hoover and the FBI knowing where the bodies were buried for 50 years. If it happened before, it could be happening now, and - for sure- it will happen in the future.

We also know that these bureaucrats are liars.  James Clapper lied outright to Congress. And he is still in a position of  trust  with the power to easily dig up embarrassing information, leak that information to the political opponents of the 205. Or just use it as a gentle reminder of potential embarrassment. And if they can rationalize lying to Congress, they can rationalize a lot more.

*****
**(If you're already interested, feel free to skip the text wall: /r/ReinstateArticle8)**

As you may already know, we've been pushing hard over the last few weeks to get something, anything started that even vaguely resembles a movement towards raising awareness as to the dire straits in which privacy has found itself (or rather, in which we've found *it*) over the past few months.

The product of all this discussion, voting, more discussion and, yes, more voting is this: /r/ReinstateArticle8, the now-home of the (#)Reinst8 Movement.

I'd like to keep this description relatively brief, as there's a tonne of information on the Sub already (and you can catch a number of us on IRC for more details) but you can think of Reinst8 as analogous to the US's RestoreThe4th campaign. Essentially, we exist to promote the restoration of privacy in the digital age and to *reinstate* (hello) those civil liberties which are being stolen from under our feet. Nebulous, you say? Perhaps, but the ideology has to govern the action. With the focus on a clear-cut message (of the kind 'Don't invade our privacy; don't encroach on our liberty' - slogan is in the works, so don't worry if you hate my wording) rather than on specific actions (PORN FILTERS BAD, TWO LEGS GOOD), we ought to be able to inspire a far more broad, far more lasting change, if only in providing people with the facts of the matter in all their terrible glory.

We are very much in the setting-up phase, at present, and have been fortunate to happen upon a rather excellent team comprised of an extremely valuable skill-set (some very experienced Reddit mods, some web-devs, some people with legal and political experience). **However, we [almost certainly need you](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReinstateArticle8/comments/1iujx1/reinst8_needs_you/)**.

If you've even a fleeting interest in digital privacy, in the atrocity of an opt-out filtering system as announced recently, in promoting a fair and considered approach to censorship in the modern age, then I strongly urge you to get involved. You don't need any particular skills, just an interest. Our primary goal is to get people talking, to raise the debate to a national level and, ultimately, to inspire action where once ill-informed apathy was found.

1375048450.0,50,self.restorethefourth,1j8jzm,A list of Tweets to your Congressmen asking if the money they took from the Defense Industry influenced their Amash NSA votes,57,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1j8jzm/a_list_of_tweets_to_your_congressmen_asking_if/,"*Just a quick edit to warn new Twitter users that if you tweet too much at first, you will be temporarily suspended by Twitter admins. I think the soft limits are roughly 200 tweets per hour, and 1000 tweets per day. So if you find this list useful, and I hope you do, just be aware that you could be suspended if you tweet too much, too fast.*

*Also, I've realized that these links don't work on iOS devices as far as I can tell. I may have an idea on how to fix that in the future, but for this round please use your computer!*

In response to Wired's article entitled [""Lawmakers Who Upheld NSA Phone Spying Received Double the Defense Industry Cash""](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/money-nsa-vote/), I've decided to use the data provided by Maplight and OpenSecrets to formulate a series of precomposed tweets which you can use to easily send a message to your Congressperson via Twitter. I have ordered the list from most egregious bribes to the least. You will notice that the bottom of the list has small amounts. I left them in for the sake of not wanting to draw the line at $1000, $10000, or $100000.

If your congressperson is not on the list below, you can assume that they a.) voted in support of the Amash amendment [[roll call](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml)] b.)  received $0 from the Defense Industry, or C.) there was no information listed in the PDF shown in the Wired article (which now appears to be broken).  The data provided is listed as ""Money from Defense/Intelligence Industry (January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2012)"". I don't have a cache of the PDF, but I do have the spreadsheet still, if anyone wants it.

Hopefully you will forward this page to friends and family and encourage to join in. If this gets a good response, I'll try to continue providing this type of thing as we move forward. Make a bookmark and send a few more each day if you want! If you don't have a Twitter account, make one. I recommend that you also actually call your Representative as well. I've included their D.C. phone numbers in each link. It literally takes 1 minute of your time.

If you find any mistakes, or have suggestions for future tweets, let me know. The tweets below all follow this formula:

&gt;Did *&amp;lt;representative&gt;* let $*&amp;lt;amount&gt;* from the Defense Industry influence his #Amash NSA vote? #Restorethe4th @*&amp;lt;representative's Twitter handle&gt;* #*&amp;lt;representative's state and district&gt;* *&amp;lt;representative's D.C. phone number&gt;*


Without further ado, here is the list. It works best for me if I force-open the link in a new tab. Have fun!

The argument has been raised numerous times that although this action by the administration is legal, it is still immoral and egregiously overreaching. In point of fact the NSA's actions are **not** legal at all.

Mr. Obama has defended his administration on the grounds that they sought out a general warrant. **United States law does not permit any general warrants.** Other countries have general warrants, but the United States does not. Per the Fourth Amendment:

&gt; The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and **no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.**

The NSA's so-called ""general warrant"" to tap our internet activity fails two of the three essential criteria for being a legitimate warrant in the United States. First of all, there cannot possibly be probable cause to investigate the entire global internet-using population for any crime, much less for terrorism. We must understand that ""probable cause"" is a totally different requirement from the ""reasonability"" in ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" **Probable cause is the same standard as is used in arrests.** In other words by claiming they have the right to search the whole internet, the government is claiming they have sufficient levels of suspicion to arrest every single person who ever used Google or Facebook. That's just laughable on its face.

Furthermore, the so-called ""general warrant"" also fails the third criterion. No serious judge could accept that the NSA has in any way particularly described the things to be seized. Certainly, the NSA may have **generally** described the things to be seized, insofar as they have demanded the content of our internet activity. But they cannot possibly have **particularly** described the things to be seized, which is what the Fourth Amendment requires.

There is no general warrant.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1g3dpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g3dpd/a_crucial_talking_point_the_united_states_has_no/,

Please hear me out.,52,4,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fywhq/i_believe_i_have_an_that_could_potentially/,"From what i've gathered in this subreddit, it seems like we're trying to get this across to *everyone* so I have an idea for how we can do that. Here are the steps that I believe we should take: 

1) Post about this to /r/Filmmakers or /r/Youtube and ask their subscribers if they could maybe create a &lt;8min video with motivational music and all that jazz about *why* we need to protest. And if at the end of the video they could ask viewers to spread the word. Remember that video, Kony 2012? We need to make a video like that and popularize it. Worst comes to worst and no one on those subreddits want to help, well then shit, we can go over to fiverr and try to get one of those folks to do it for us. Also, because we are going to post this video to a large audience, it is advised that the video should be kept very simple in terms of vocabulary and very emotion invoking.

2) Then we can post the finished video to /r/videos and hope that it goes viral from there being that most videos posted there hit YouTube front page overnight. Plus, it seems like most of Reddit supports this protest, so upvotes should be at our side. We could also potentially do a raid upvote kind of thing to secure the video's spot in the front page. 

3) If the video doesn't go viral, then we can utilize large websites like Tumblr. What can contact the ""tumblr famous"" and promote them to reblog the video or something similar of that sort. Afterwards, I believe that the things from tumblr will trickle down to Facebook &amp; other similar sites. 

**TL;DR: Kony 2012.**

After all of this is done with, i'm sure that we will hopefully have obtained a large base of followers and media coverage.

One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.

Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.

With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.

You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""

""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.

Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.

You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.

This all happened in the country where I live.

You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.

Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?

You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for?Safety?

Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?

I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.

I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

​As of last night, I was elected to become National Coordinator of the Restore the Fourth movement. I am very pleased and honored to accept this title, and I look forward to serving you all. Before talking about the things I hope to do as NC, I’d like to give those of you who don’t know me a little background on what I have done with the movement so far. 

​Since I joined the movement, I’ve been able to log 14-18 hours every day working on whatever project I can find because I work from home. I helped draft the original goals and demands list, and I bounced between each group before finding my niche in marketing, where I helped as much as possible for a day or so. A day or two may not sound like much time, but if you imagine working between 14-18 hours in one channel for almost two days, you get the picture of how tedious that can be. After that time, I decided I just wanted to pick up whatever project I could get my hands on, and helped many different people with many aspects of the movement. I helped draft the FAQ of the website, wrote the training manual for meeting chairs, co-wrote the reddit ​blog post describing the movement (which should be out soon), and many other different important documents.

​The thing that is most important to me when it comes to leadership is making sure that I know the concerns and feelings of every group involved before I make a decision on anything. For those of you who go to the meetings on the IRC channel, you have probably seen me delegate and moderate quite a few different big discussions on certain matters. I always aim to be impartial and unbiased, and I seek to make certain that the group is involved with the decision-making. That is the approach I would like to bring to the leadership of the movement if I should be elected. I have never made a decision on big issues or tasks without first consulting others and getting their input, which I feel is paramount to being a good leader.

​Now for the details on what I would like to do. As National Coordinator, I feel obligated to bring the other people who have been working tirelessly on the movement to the subreddit’s attention, so that they can be confirmed officially. This is something that I will be doing in separate posts, so that you can learn more about each person’s involvement in the movement, and why they should be accepted into their corresponding posts. This is something that the community will decide, so make sure you carefully think about what would be the best for the movement!

​I’d also like to say thank you all for all that you have done for this movement. If it wasn’t for all of the hard workers, the planners, the idealists, and the people that decided to make a change, our movement wouldn’t be as great as it has been turning into. I encourage you all to keep doing what you are doing, because if we do, we CAN keep our rights from being trampled on again, and that is something we need to work hard to do! 

​If anyone has any ideas for the movement, or would like to get involved, feel free to contact me or any of the other moderators of this subreddit, because we want to know what YOU think would make the movement thrive, and we need volunteers to make the ideas happen! 

​Again, thank you all for your help, and rally on!",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1gq9g9,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1gq9g9/important_leadership_announcement/,moderator

So if we are going to do this, in order for it to be effective without actually getting tens of millions of people into the streets, there *has* to be media coverage.

I would much prefer if we could get tens of millions into the streets, and it is possible that could happen over time, but in order to reach the critical mass to hit that target, it seems we will need media coverage.


So, how do we get it?

Also, bear in mind that the US Government will no doubt consider this movement to be ""enemies of the state"" material, as it deals directly with implementing new government by utilizing our right to revolt. So it would certainly be made easier if we got police officers on our side as well? Surely there has to be a large number of police officers who can agree with us on these privacy issues.

Polls keep showing that the idea of 'spying' doesn't unnerve roughly half of Americans if it's for national security or 'preventing terrorism'. The thought I keep coming back to is that spying needs to be rebranded as 'terrorism' in the public psyche. The government is terrorizing us and making us feel unsafe with these programs.

An argument that 'federal terrorism' should be used to fight other forms of terrorism wins few supporters.

I'm representing the PR people from the irc involved with the restore the fourth movement, and we need your help.

If this gets as big as we want it to, we're going to have a lot of people on board, and more importantly, a lot of press. we're trying to prepare for that now by setting up a network of PR representatives who would represent the movement on a regional level. 

This means that you would be responsible for representing the nationwide movement on a regional basis. 

Here's how it would work: let's say a reporter wanted either an interview with leaders of the movement, or information on it on a local scale. He/she would inquire at our official email address, press@restorethefourth.net. Our Head PR guys in charge of that email would link him up with the contact information of a local press representative; their Email and/or phone number. The reporter would then talk to the regional representative about whatever they wanted, whether it be an interview, additional information, etc. 

We need people to be those regional representatives. 



If you're interested, you're going to have to possess the following:

* A working email and telephone number that you would be willing to publicize ( you may get your own email in the future, but that depends on whether or not the techies would set up a universal Email program that is stable and useable) 

* Absolute dedication to our movement (no quitting halfway through, or randomly going MIA)

* An understanding that if you take up this responsibility you will NOT be anonymous. your identity and contact information will be known.

* excellent mannerisms, politeness, and an outstanding ability to maneuver with the press, whether they be positive or negative. 

*  Large-scale involvement and knowledgeability in regards to your local Protesting efforts in every aspect. 

This responsibility will not be a walk in the park. it will require effort and dedication. remember that one misstep could dislodge and derail our entire movement, and all of the effort we've put into it thus far.

If you have any questions or concerns, Please comment below. If you have interest, please PM me. 

Thanks in advance guys. -RT4PR

Tactics to accomplish this could include asking politely at a town hall meeting, asking at a press conference, or having a sit-in in a Senator's office until they agree.

The framing I would use myself: 

""Hi Senator ___, my name is Ben and I'm a constituent of yours and a member of Restore the Fourth. Since the NSA programs that were recently revealed clearly violate the 4th Amendment, my only conclusion is that Congress must not be familiar with the 4th Amendment.""

Followed by either:

* ""Would you mind reciting the 4th Amendment so we can all be confident that your votes in the future will take it into account? I've brought a copy for you, in case you want to get the exact wording right."" 

Or

* ""I've brought you a copy of the 4th Amendment, which I hope you'll accept so we can all be confident that your votes in the future will reflect the 4th Amendment.""

There are several advantages to this approach in my opinion:

* This gives RT4 members in every part of the country a straightforward way to act locally in support of a national effort
* 535 chances to make the local news
* Refocuses the debate away from Snowden and on the unconstitutionality of these programs
* Creates opportunities for ongoing actions in between larger planned protests and events

1374943251.0,35,self.restorethefourth,1j60az,Email Response from Rep. Candice Miller (R-MI) on Why She Voted Nay on H.R.2397 (Amash-Conyers Amendment to Restrict NSA Intelligence-Gathering). X-Post from /r/politics,42,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1j60az/email_response_from_rep_candice_miller_rmi_on_why/,"&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding an amendment to H.R. 2397, the annual Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, seeking to defund intelligence-gathering efforts of the National Security Agency (NSA).  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue, and I am pleased for the opportunity to respond to your concerns.
&gt; 
&gt;As you know, Representatives Justin Amash (R-MI) and John Conyers (D-MI) offered an amendment to the annual Department of Defense Appropriations Bill on July 24, 2013 which sought to restrict the capability of the NSA to collect information such as phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  I heard from several of my constituents on this issue, and after careful consideration, I opposed the Amash-Conyers amendment because I believe it would have destroyed a vital tool that our government uses to defend our nation against foreign terrorists seeking to murder our fellow citizens.  I also believe it went against the first and foremost Constitutional responsibility of the federal government, which is to defend America against our enemies.  
&gt; 
&gt;I do not believe that the rights guaranteed by our Constitution extend to foreign terrorists, and our sacred rights should not provide them with any protection while they plot to kill our fellow citizens.  I agreed with a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal which stated that this amendment would ""return America to a pre-9/11 mindset on fighting terror that treats terrorists as street burglars instead of enemies of our nation.""  I also agreed with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which stated that the Amash-Conyers Amendment takes ""the wrong approach to an important question, is probably unwise and possibly un-Constitutional.""
&gt; 
&gt;The program that this amendment would destroy has been credited with helping to stop 54 terrorist plots in 20 countries around the world against American citizens, American interests or those of our allies.  On the other hand, the proponents of this effort have not come forward with a single instance of any American who has had his or her Constitutional rights violated, who has been wrongly charged with any crime, or has been harmed in any way.  In my opinion, the threat to our civil liberties suggested by the Amash-Conyers Amendment is a phantom threat that does not exist.  As my colleague on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michelle Bachmann, said, the sponsors of the Amash-Conyers Amendment are putting forward a false narrative.
&gt; 
&gt;One of the attacks that this program provided the key piece of information that allowed our intelligence and law enforcement officials to stop was the plot to explode bombs on the New York City subway system. That plot was led by an Afghan immigrant, Najibullah Zazzi, and other terrorists inside our country.  The plot was discovered when Zazzi's phone number had been in contact with a known terrorist overseas, and it was thwarted just before it was set to take place. Law enforcement officials estimate that 1,000 or more Americans would have been killed if this brutal and evil attack had been carried out.  Those are the facts, and many innocent men, women and children are alive today because this program allowed the government to connect the dots and stop this attack before the terrorists struck, just as it was admonished to do by the 9/11 Commission, to better protect our nation.  That is real and just one example of the attacks avoided and lives saved due to this program.  
&gt; 
&gt;I wonder how many dead Americans the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment would be willing to accept in the effort to protect an alleged 4th Amendment protection for terrorists like Najibullah Zazzi.  I say 'alleged' because the program in place does not violate the 4th Amendment protections of Americans.  In the 1979 Smith v. Maryland decision, the Supreme Court ruled that telephone billing records were not protected by the 4th Amendment because they were the property of the phone company, not the individual.  So the collection of phone metadata, such as number and duration of the call, to support this program violates no individual's rights under the 4th Amendment.  
&gt; 
&gt;It is also disappointing the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment put forward so much false and misleading information.  Many led people to believe that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, which maintains strict judicial oversight of the program, was allowing the NSA to gather not just metadata, but also the content of telephone conversations.  This is simply untrue.  All that is collected is phone numbers and duration of calls.  No names, no addresses, and no content is attached to this information.  They also led people to believe that the NSA has unfettered access to this information.  This is also untrue.  In fact, the NSA cannot even do a search of the data for a particular phone number unless they have a court order provided for a specific purpose.  In 2012, there were fewer than 300 searches on this data; hardly a broad trampling of the rights of 360,000,000 Americans.  The only numbers that are ever searched are those contacted by known terrorists overseas.  I do not believe we should provide protections to those in our nation plotting with known terrorists from across the world. 
&gt; 
&gt;The supporters of this amendment have also voted to release the terrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay and either send them back to their countries or bring them into American civilian courts for trial.  I believe, once again, that this extension of Constitutional rights to some of the world's most heinous terrorists, including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Muhammed, is wrongheaded, makes our nation less secure, is unprecedented in our nation's history and emboldens our enemies to make further attacks on American citizens and interests.
&gt; 
&gt;However, in order to effectively protect the Constitutional rights of Americans without endangering our national security, I am proud to have supported the Nugent-Pompeo Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill which states:
&gt; 
&gt;""None of funds made available by this Act may be used by the National Security Agency to—conduct an acquisition pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 for the purpose of targeting a United States person; or acquire, monitor, or store the contents of any electronic communication of a United States person from a provider of electronic communication services to the public pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.""
&gt; 
&gt;The Nugent-Pompeo Amendment makes perfectly clear that the content of any communication of Americans within our nation are off limits to collection by the NSA under FISA, and it passed by a vote of 409-12.
&gt; 
&gt;The Amash-Conyers Amendment, on the other hand, would have limited the collection of data to only those individuals who are the subject of an investigation.  This amendment does not mention Americans at all.  Consequently, it would prevent the collection and analysis of all bulk data – not just the data of American citizens. The Amash-Conyers Amendment dictates that the NSA would not be able to collect and analyze bulk data from Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan, or any other country around the world where people are actively working to murder innocent Americans.  As Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, it is my experience that fighting terrorism is like finding a needle in a haystack.  Terrorists live in the shadows and plot secretly.  The Amash-Conyers Amendment would require that we find the needle, wherever it may be across the globe, before our intelligence officials could even look in the haystack.
&gt; 
&gt;I refuse to go back to the pre-9/11 mindset that provides those who seek to murder our fellow citizens space to plot and scheme in the shadows while tying the hands of those seeking to stop them.  I believe that such an approach violates the first duty given to the federal government by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, as well as the oath I took to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.
&gt; 
&gt;For all of these reasons, I voted to defeat the Amash-Conyers Amendment when it was considered in the House, and it ultimately failed by a vote of 205-217.  I can assure you I will continue to fulfill my Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense of our nation while also fully honoring the sacred rights enjoyed by every American.

Then spread it around to all of the biggest accounts no matter who they are. Its not abut getting the big accounts to notice you, its getting to the traffic they receive.

Also, I know it doesn't sound like an effective tactic, but you will find that twitter is a megaphone for any cause. OWS and all the other big movements owe most of their success to twitter.

Here are some more tips to make this a successful campaign

1. Don't just tweet once. Tweet for an hour or so and make it constant.

2. Use hashtags that are trending to get more people to see your tweets.

3. Search for a relate topic like #nsa or #snowden then tweet to the biggest accounts **This is essential in getting a response**

4. Don't care who you tweet. Its not about the account, people of all sorts go to the big accounts, and its about reaching them.

Good luck. Remember if you don't wanna help that's fine, but it's deconstructive to try and dissuade people from using a promotional tactic that won't harm our image.

[Last slide for now](http://imgur.com/vcpbsTz)  We need a good organizing page.  What I'm showing here is something developers will need to weigh in on.  I don't want to bust anyone's balls making this.  But I think it'd be cool to have a CSI style interface showing our true might and power.  Of course, the dropdown will let you go right to your state, because personally I hate messing with maps.  This is more about showing off than getting stuff down, the l33t users will go right for the drop down.    


I have a ton more ideas but I want to see if I'm a loser first.  So tell me reddit, is it good or bad?  Should I keep wokring on it?

Thanks guys.    

EDIT (Probably first of many):  I forgot to add something.  Somewhere on there we need a statement like what /u/timetoact2013 put on this subreddit.  It is a statement of nonviolence that says that we as a movement only support actions that are protected by our Constitutional Rights.  That's hugely important.  Probably on many of the inner pages, home page, and also in the footer.   

Also, Nov 5th is election day.  That's the point of that statement.  Voting to get what we want.  Debate it?  I dunno.  

EDIT 2: /u/timetochange2013 brings up a good point.  PLEASE IGNORE THE SPECIFICS OF THE TEXT I WROTE, even specific features.  I'm proposing basic templates to get us up and running, and basic branding elements (US flag and simple typeface).  Since /u/timetochange2013 has done a good job thus far of getting a good message out there, perhaps he/she would volunteer to consult with developers on what the site should say, and which feature are most relevant?

Here it is. For those of you that have never attended a protest before, here's a whole bunch of do's and don'ts. The long and short of it? **be there to educate the public- not annoy them, and don't go looking for a fight but have a backup plan if (AND ONLY IF) a fight finds you**

Primarily- be respectful of everyone.

Focus on education of passersby over being a nuisance. 

More people will listen and care if you approach them respectfully than if you scream at them as they pass by. 

Avoid chanting too much- it's intimidating. 

Don't wear masks. 

Try and look somewhat professional. The stranger you look, the less people will listen.

Have paper handouts about the movement, and with instructions on what people can/should do. 

Know what you're talking about. 

Have a 'plan-b' in case the cops show up, but don't act as if every authority figure has a person vendetta against you- as long as you are not breaking the law, you are allowed to peacefully protest. 

The cops will only have a problem with you if you start getting too aggressive, blocking traffic, or are way too loud (no boom boxes blasting 'fuck the police-' I'm looking at you, Occupy) they won't arrest you just for protesting- they literally *can't.* If it does happen for some reason, welcome to headline news. 

Know your audience- a young family with screaming children doesn't want to talk for fifteen minutes, and an old lady isn't going to care about the technical details of exactly how spying has been done on programs she can't consistently operate on her own.

Take some water bottles- enough to share. It's going to be hot and dehydration is dangerous. 

Bring extras of everything- flyers, posters, sharpies, etc. 

Help your official organizer with whatever they need. 

Don't antagonize anyone needlessly, especially anyone who has been drinking or is carrying a firearm- especially both.

Don't block traffic. Don't block the sidewalk. 

Don't bring any contraband with you. 

Don't smoke where you oughtn't. 

Listen to your organizer. 

Smile. Be approchable. Talk about it like it matters to you.  

If you stop sweating on a hot day, drink an entire bottle of water immediately. Your body is starting to conserve water (stop sweating) because it is preparing to die.

Get in touch with your local organizer. Like, share, and retweet their content. 

Email, tweet at, or call your local news sources and radio stations and let them know you want to see coverage about the event.

Don't be an ass. 

Don't be stupid. 

Support your fellow protester.

Don't stand alone- stand in pairs at minimum.

Keep an eye on each other. Watch for harassment, and signs of dehydration.

You are not there to be a hero- you are there to hand out flyers and talk to people. No drama, no mess, just education and outreach.

Don't go looking for a fight with the cops or you'll find one.

If any member of your protest starts behaving in a way that endangers the entire protest, ask them to leave. Don't let one person ruin the whole protest. 

Be safe, be polite, be effective. 

Let the people know that their freedoms are in jeopardy. 

Be able to explain your point in less than sixty seconds- but also be able to have an in-depth discussion. Have a concise, easy-to-read handout that outlines various courses of actions.

Good luck.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1hg92t,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hg92t/for_firsttime_protesters_some_tips_tricks_and/,

They tended to hold fairly extreme views about privacy and freedom, and were dedicated to the idea that the best way to secure these things was to write and give away code.  This seems particularly relevant in the current moment.

Right now, we've been confronted with strong evidence that the government isn't respecting our privacy.  Most people's responses to this are political -- we can have rallies, we can write blog posts or emails to our representatives, etc.

The cypherpunk approach was different.  Instead of petitioning the government to give us these rights, we ought to take them by creating and distributing tools that will allow us to communicate securely, without fear of wiretapping.

In other words, instead of begging Facebook and the government to stop violating privacy rights, build a new thing similar to Facebook that can't be wiretapped.  And try to get people to use it.

A really great contemporary example of the Cypherpunks approach is Mailvelope, which makes it easier to use encryption with Gmail.

I was on the Cypherpunks list.  I asked a few questions, but wasn't much of a contributor.  I am not a libertarian, and I don't endorse all of the ideas that came out of the list, or perhaps even most of them.

But I do believe that protests are likely to effect much change now, and that better tools are our best bet.

Today I got back a response from representative Chris Stewart, and the contents made me feel a bit more optimistic.  

""Dear Mr. _______

Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding the recent revelations of NSA surveillance. This is an important issue and I appreciate the time you took to express your thoughts.
 
While this collection of information resulted from a decision approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court, the recently revealed programs still trouble me. I have two principal concerns with the NSA programs in question. First is the potential for abuse. Even if we accept that the programs have played an important role in stopping various terrorist attacks, the recent IRS scandal is a prime example of the dangers of government power in the hands of individuals acting unethically. There is no evidence of NSA abusing the data involved, but the potential is there, and that worries me, particularly given this Administration’s proclivity to abuse its power in other areas. If history, teaches us one thing, it is that all power given to the government is eventually abused. This should concern us all.
 
My second concern is simply that we’ve unnecessarily crossed the line between the need to protect national security and the need to protect individual privacy. It is undeniably a balance, but the briefings I have attended since coming to Congress, including numerous classified briefings, have not convinced me that preventing another attack on the scale of 9/11 requires this level of intrusiveness.
 
As a member of the Homeland Security Committee’s Counter-terrorism and Intelligence Sub-Committee, I recognize that we live in a very dangerous world. I am also committed to finding the tools to protect our country without unduly sacrificing individual liberty. I believe we need to take this opportunity to have a very frank and honest conversation with the American people regarding these issues.
 
Again, thank you for contacting my office. If you have further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. To stay informed on this issue and others, follow me on facebook.com/RepChrisStewart, or sign up for my monthly e-newsletter at stewart.house.gov.

Chris Stewart

The decades old domestic anti-propaganda law protecting the public from direct manipulation is now gone. On July 2nd, the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, that for decades has prevented government-made new stories intended for foreign audiences from being broadcast within the U.S., came to an end via an amendment tacked onto the National Defense Authorization Act. Now, news stories meant for nations abroad can be broadcast (or used as source material for original programming) to American audiences. While it is common for government and a complicit media to lie to the American public, deception and misinformation has now been codified into law.

Now false Government generated news stories can be broadcast in the US as if they were true. I realize this isnt 'directly' related to the RT4 movement, but its something we have to keep in mind when we talk to others.

Press Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

To: the Representatives and Senators of the 113th Congress and the President of the United States

We are Restore the Fourth: a coalition of citizens from across the political spectrum. We aim to restore the Fourth Amendment to its intended purpose: ""protect[ing] the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"". The American people have a steadfast expectation of privacy for their personal communications, electronic and otherwise. That expectation is more than reasonable, it is self-evident.

As the courts have made clear, electronic messages, files, and other communications are protected by the Fourth Amendment. These rights have suffered systematic violations over the last 12 years and in response we have prepared a list of goals outlining our mission. Additionally, we have drafted a list of actions that we insist must be taken in order to remedy these violations and restore the fundamental Fourth Amendment rights of the American people.

Restore the Fourth seeks to:

1. Raise public awareness of the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the United States government.

    The American people have a right to know the actions of their government. Accountability is the foundation of democracy, and it is necessary to ensure the protection of the Constitution and the people it serves.

2. Ensure that the scope of government surveillance is constitutional, limited, clearly defined, and strictly enforced.

    Surveillance activities must be conducted within the legal bounds defined by the Constitution and US law. In order to effectively defend the rights of the people, these bounds must be clearly stated and strictly enforced.

3. Establish a clear and transparent system of accountability for the United States' intelligence community.

    A clear system of accountability is required in order to properly enforce restrictions on surveillance activities. This system must be open and visible to the American people in order to ensure that proper protocols are followed.

Restore the Fourth demands that the U.S. government:

1. Conduct a congressional hearing and a criminal investigation into the extent and constitutionality of domestic government surveillance programs.

    A full investigation must be conducted to determine the scale and legality of the actions taken by the US intelligence community. This must include revealing the scope and duration of surveillance programs, as well as examining the institutional factors that allowed their creation. The methodology and results of the investigation must be made public.

2. Reform the USA PATRIOT Act, specifically Section 215 but generally with respect to the rights of American citizens, and impose clear constraints on the powers granted by FISA.

    Many legislative actions taken since 9/11 have allowed an expansion of government surveillance powers in the name of safety and security. It is vital that these powers be reined in to stay within the boundaries outlined by the Constitution.

3. Take a federal stance against law-enforcement practices across the nation which also violate our physical security and privacy, such as “stop-and-frisk” and internal security check-points.

    The PRISM program that has recently come to light is one of many slowly expanding violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. The safety and privacy of our persons must also be ensured.

4. Hold those involved in government surveillance programs accountable to stringent and transparent judicial oversight.

    Accountability is paramount to ensure such violations do not happen in the future. Those responsible for violating the Constitution must be brought to light and their conduct reviewed by a duly appointed judge to determine the legality of their behavior.

5. Remove James Clapper from his position as Director of National Intelligence.

    Director James Clapper gave misleading or false testimony before the Congress in response to inquiries by Senator Ron Wyden in a March 12, 2013 hearing. These statements are a breach of the public's trust, if not a violation of US law. As such, a full investigation must be conducted into Mr. Clapper's knowledge and testimony, as well as the legality of his actions.



We will hold demonstrations nationwide on July 4th, and are already coordinating efforts across the country to ensure a powerful message is sent on a day that is so symbollically significant to our liberty. We will exercise our First Amendment rights to Restore the Fourth.
The power of a government should exist to reflect the will of its people. We, the American people, demand that our government adhere to its Constitutional limits and respect our wishes. If those currently in office cannot or will not rectify the troubling violations of our rights, we will act swiftly to replace them. We urge you to act on these requests in order to end the violation of our rights and liberties, and to uphold the Constitution as you swore to do when you took office:

""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

-Congressional Oath of Office

Awaiting Your Action,

Restore the Fourth

1370964744.0,30,self.restorethefourth,1g4jro,Stop PRISM,34,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g4jro/stop_prism/,"As we have all seen in recent weeks, scandals have begun to plague this nation.

In light of the recent revelation regarding the National Security Agency’s “PRISM” program, as well as their collection of all telephone metadata, we have decided that enough is enough in regards to warrant-less spying upon the American people. When you have “nothing to hide,” it hurts your argument when you hide behind your computer. We are calling upon the administration to immediately cease the PRISM program, and all other related programs which violate the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

One may argue that the 4th Amendment does not protect us in the case of online communications through companies, but the semantics of the writing, which specifically says we shall be secure in all “papers and effects”, held great foresight, and indeed covers these exact problems. In addition to the cessation of these programs, we call upon all involved in the implementation of these programs to resign from their posts. In the event that these people do not, we call upon Congress, the direct representatives of the people, to do whatever is necessary to force their resignation. We, the People, have had enough.

We are not the only members of this nation who are upset. Reddit has begun this Restore the Fourth movement, and plans to march on Washington and elsewhere on July 4th in order to redress not just PRISM, but the PATRIOT Act, the IRS scandals and corruption in general. Before that our aim is to gather people in one place to shout about something specific, to maintain our focus and to prevent the disorder we saw in movements like OWS and the Tea Party; we want to have preliminary gatherings BEFORE the Fourth to establish more cohesion in our attempts to organize.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has helped to establish [Prism Break](http://prism-break.org/), where visitors are informed of which alternative applications are the best for avoiding PRISM detection. Still, others have decided to [troll the NSA](http://trollthensa.com/) by encouraging all netizens to use words which have been confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security to be trigger words.

All of these gestures are positive, but alone they are not enough. Combating PRISM and the monolithic State which supports it will require nothing short of active participation and civil disobedience. You have to start talking about this. Spread the word: people want to gather and so we will. Beyond our words and our public expression of anger, we must act accordingly - these protests cannot be about protecting our identity, for everything about who we are has been compromised. They know our names, our faces, our phone numbers, who we associate with, and what we say in our emails, “papers and effects.”

When we protest PRISM, we have “nothing to hide” and we must show that to be the case. This also provides that the media will have that much less ammunition against us when they invariably turn the spin-cycle on double time. Withdraw from the System, put your money where your mouth is, and be prepared to get organized.

**Code of Conduct**

Remember: We are here to educate and persuade otherwise apathetic people. Those who disagree with us will try to paint us in a negative light. (Sad but true, it’s politics). Don’t do anything that will make us look bad.

    Stay within the bounds of the law
    Show respect
    Stay on topic
    No profanity
    Remain orderly
    No violence
    Make preparations, in case the protest lasts more than a day.
    Clean up after yourselves

What is going here on Reddit is very powerful and encouraging. 4chan has also seen a surprising turnout of support against PRISM and there are over a dozen of us preparing effective propaganda, symbolism, and helpful resources to assist us in preparation of these protests, tentatively being held toward the end of June (the 22nd or the 27th). Concerned members of reddit, please lend your eyes and assistance.

The secret services AIVD and MIVD work much more closely together on wiretapping with projects like Symbolon and Argo II. The government doesn't reveal any details.

The ministers of Interior and Defense confirm the existence of Symbolon and Argo II, both a collaboration of the AIVD and MIVD concerning Sigint (signal intelligence) and 'cyber'. They did this after [recent questions](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-229712.pdf) of SP MP Ronald van Raak who argued that it is about interception of internet traffic going through the major internet hub AMS-IX.

**AIVD and MIVD together in 'cyber'**

This is not explicitly denied by the government, but the ministers write: ""The Intelligence and Security Services Act 2002 doesn't allow undirected interception of the AMS-IX.""

Symbolon, among others, is mentioned in the [annual report](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/blg-223499.pdf) of the MIVD. [Argo II](https://www.rijksictdashboard.nl/content/project/argo-ii) is tendered out for 17 million euro. The involvement of Accenture and NICE Systems is not confirmed and details not provided. ""The functional specifications of the platform give insight into the modus operandi of the MIVD and are therefore classified state secret,"" said the ministers.

They emphasize that there is ""no involvement of a supplier, either directly or through subsidiaries, in the collection of Sigint"".

Officially the collection of Sigint is only allowed from wireless connections like satellite and radio communication. However, the government is incubating for years the possibility to extend this power to wired communication.

**More concerns over wide-reaching wiretaps**

According to the civil rights organization Bits of Freedom, the government is beating around the bush. ""Why does Plasterk not write that undirected interception doesn't happen? Given the turmoil that has unfolded Plasterk should remove any possible doubt,"" said Ot van Daalen, director of BoF.

The vague wording of the answers only raise more concern about undirected interception in the Netherlands. ""The House must ask further questions. We need to know exactly what plans are being made in secret to wiretap our internet traffic.""

**Inspection of AMS-IX**

Van Raak wasn't immediately available for comment. Earlier today, during the PRISM hearing, MP Astrid Oosenbrug (PvdA) proposed to have a look at the AMS-IX to see ""with my own eyes"" what is happening there.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1372266913.0,,,True,t3_1h46ss,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1h46ss/dutch_government_confirms_wiretapping_projects/,

I propose that we support our message by boycotting the companies which lied to us about their participation in PRISM, sold our data, and violated our privacy. I think there need to be consequences for these companies. Of course I'm not naive, and I don't think that people will willingly stop using a service they love. That is why I have compiled this preliminary list of services which offer the same functionality without compromising our civil rights.


**The companies that we know participated in PRISM are Mircosoft, Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Paltalk, AOL, Apple, and Dropbox.**


At first I was concerned that the assortment of services provided by these companies will be irreplaceable with pro-freedom alternatives.


After some research, my opinion has changed. I now think that we can effectively remove these companies from our lives without sacrificing the convenience we've grown accustomed to. 


In addition, our collective rejection of these companies is far likelier to bring results than protesting alone. Protesting is great for spreading awareness, but we need to do more than just stand outside and complain. PRISM is a PR disaster for these companies. We need to make sure that their fears are confirmed, that there are consequences for betraying their users.


This list will be arranged by the functionality of the service. I hope the community can help improve this list.

[Prism-break](https://prism-break.org/) is another such list with many more services mentioned.

I suggest that some of the funds donated to Restore the Fourth should go into hosting a private diaspora server for the movement where we can share photos of protests, coordinate further action, discuss etc. My ultimate hope would be that enough users migrate away from facebook to generate bad press for them and, in the process, hurt their stock price. Once facebook's bottom line is hit by our actions you'll see them scramble to backpedal in any way they can. We should make an example out of them.

This list is still rudimentary. I would greatly appreciate it if the community took it and improved upon it. I hope someone would be kind enough to write a simple guide to boycotting these companies that even my mom could follow if she wanted to.


This is a simple list of changes which can be completed in under an hour or slightly more if changing OSes too. This is action that can be taken by anyone sitting at their computer reading this. When the corporation's profits were threatened by SOPA, they united to undermine government tyranny. We must harness our power as their ""product"" to make them pursue our interests as zealously as they pursued their own. We must make our interests their interest.


I think this is the way to make our message heard. If we all made these changes on the same agreed upon day, it would probably cause a noticeable drop in traffic to these websites. I think this is the next step we are looking for.

I found that there was a lot of insults about the size etc of the movement by relatively new users. A lot of ""it isn't going to do anything"" and ""silly internet protest"" remarks.

My question is why? Everyone who is involved with politics uses the internet to keep messages going. Every protest, no matter how small, matters. Criticising the movement for those reasons is pointless if you are against government dragnet surveillance..... All those comments do is harm the cause. (and if that is the intent I must wonder why?)

After todays protests we need to expand. We have momentum within the community. We have shown that this has become more than an internet musing. Get onto other subs and brave the downvotes.

I apologize in advance if you are pictured (if you want a photo removed tell me, although they were all taken on public property and there is no identifying info)

I fully support this cause, but we need make sure we are spreading the right message. This post is a rant, and I don't care if you don't agree, but it made the protest a lot worse, and it could have been pretty awesome. I don't have solutions beside education. Maybe have someone state a brief message at the beginning of the rally and every once and a while of what we are protesting. A lot of people seemed to be confused.

My only problem is the people who didn't seem to know why they were there, and were spreading the wrong message.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/BeGUg5A.jpg) is a prime example. The UN isn't spying on us, the UN can barely decide what they have for lunch.

Then [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/a8dRkMR.jpg) pulled this banner in front of anybody. I don't even know what that means. You want socialism? Isn't that pretty much the opposite of what we want? Also this was the same guy as the UN poster.

There were also a [lot](http://i.imgur.com/Fiauf8v.jpg) of [people](http://i.imgur.com/3YtVwss.jpg) who brought [rifles](http://i.imgur.com/hFCLeBf.jpg). I understand we have a right to bear arms, and that the 2nd amendment protects this, and that's it's legal to open carry a rifle in Texas, but it confused a lot of people. As I was leaving I heard someone say ""What is this?"" ""Some sort of 2nd amendment protest it looks like""

I realize it was short notice, and once again the local organizers did a great job, but some of the speakers didn't even really mentioned 4th amendment or NSA or anything. And the open mic did not help anything. It was a good idea, but it mostly turned into people ranting about unrelated conspiracies

Then there was two provokers (might not be tied to the government or police, but they were trying to start something). They jumped up on the stage and started saying what they wanted. There's not much we can do about this, but I think if we don't yell at them they won't get so mad. Maybe have an organizer ask them to step down. This guy read the bill of rights in the middle of a guy playing guitar. I think it was a good idea, but go talk to the coordinators about it. This guy was walking around yelling the whole time. He found a buddy later and they yelled about how they were veterans so they can do whatever they want.

Anyway. Awesome protest. But it could be a lot better. I don't mean to be snobby about it, but it seemed like the public had no idea what we were talking about. We had people talking about Occupy, anarchy, and all sorts of things.

Edit: Oh yeah! And the V masks! Leave them at home. When I was leaving I saw media interviewing the rifle guys and the V mask guys. The more unified we can be about our message, the more effective it's going to be!

Edit 2: I just remembered a funny quote by one of the open mic people who I guess thought this was occupy. Keep in mind being a veteran and the military became a huge issue during this for some reason ""If we KNOW 9-11 was an inside job... Ummm... Doesn't that mean veterans know what they are doing when they go overseas to kill brown people for money?""",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1372979166.0,,,True,t3_1hng8v,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hng8v/know_what_you_are_protesting/,

Thank you for contacting me about National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs. I appreciate learning your views.
 
I am profoundly concerned government agencies have been secretly collecting the communication records of American citizens for the past several years. While the tools Congress has granted to the law enforcement and intelligence communities have been important in identifying dangerous terrorists and their support networks, I believe the NSA’s phone probe, in which the phone records of millions of innocent Americans are seized, goes too far.
 
As you may know, I authored the U.S. Patriot Act in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. I believe this legislation struck an appropriate balance between national security concerns and civil rights. To prevent abuse, I insisted on sunsetting provisions so that they would automatically expire if Congress did not renew them. This would allow Congress to conduct oversight of the administration's implementation of the act.
 
The NSA’s phone surveillance program was conducted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Under this section, the government is required to prove to a special federal court, known as a FISA court, that it is complying with specific guidelines set by the Attorney General and that the information sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.
 
Technically, the administration's actions appear lawful insofar as they were done pursuant to an order from the FISA court. But based on the scope of the released order, both the administration and the FISA court are relying on an unbounded interpretation of the act that Congress never intended. For these reasons, I wrote Attorney General Eric Holder regarding the FBI’s broad application to obtain phone records. I also intend to work with the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and pursue necessary changes to Section 215 to prevent further abuses.
 
Thanks again for contacting me.
 
Sincerely,

F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.

It has come to my attention that both Congress and the executive office have launched criminal investigations into the NSA leak, looking to find the identity of the individual who has exposed the massive and systematic breach of public trust perpetuated by the government to the public. 

Knowing that the full weight of the Federal government is about to come down on this anonymous whistleblower who sought to preserve the rights of the people rather then follow the orders of the state, it is more then likely that they will be found out sooner rather then later. Without any kind of support from the public this individual has worked to protect, said individual will most likely end up like Bradley Manning- arrested and held by charges of treason against the very country he has sought to protect.

**Twitter 101:** If you don't have a Twitter account but would like to help, here's how.

1. Create a Twitter account. You will be asked to follow celebrities during the tutorial. Pick them at random, you can unfollow them later.

2. Once your account is setup, feel free to add a profile picture or any other personal details. This step is optional.

3. In the top search bar, type in #NSA, #PRISM, #Restorethe4th, or any of the above hashtags. When you see a relevant tweet, hit the 'retweet' button. This is like an upvote on reddit- it supports the tweet and shows it to your followers. Do this for relevant tweets, especially those tweeted by area protest's official accounts.

4. That's it! Doing that helps boost the signal of our tweets and hashtags. Be careful, though. Don't retweet thousands of tweets, and don't seem spammy. Smaller sessions throughout a day will help more than one long mega-session. A few here and there will help a lot.

Hello [Name of Member of Congress],

I am calling to express my grave concern over the recent findings that the National Security Agency is conducting mass, unregulated surveillance of Americans’ private information.

The act of gathering all records of my personal e-mails, phone calls, internet searches, and audio and video activities is a massive breach of my right to privacy as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.

This type of blanket data collection by the government erodes fundamental American values of freedom and privacy, as well as at very fabric of democracy itself. It violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guards citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures and protects their right to privacy.

I am calling you to ask that you take immediate action in Congress to halt this surveillance and provide a full public account of the NSA’s and the FBI’s data collection programs. I am asking you also to:

1. Repeal (a) Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (b) the State Secrets Privilege and (c) the FISA Amendments Act, because blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the U.S. without a warrant is prohibited by law.
2. Introduce new legislation that will (a) eliminate the secret court system within FISA and (b) establish guidelines to stringently hold accountable any public officials who are either responsible for, or untruthful about unconstitutional surveillance activities.
3. Check the power of these surveillance programs by evaluating them in both a full congressional and Supreme Court judicial review.

Thank you, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today and listen to my concerns.

1373345435.0,29,self.restorethefourth,1hwzpc,A Collection of Practical Ideas to Reclaim Privacy from the NSA et al.,32,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1hwzpc/a_collection_of_practical_ideas_to_reclaim/,"Let me begin by distinguishing between two forms of outrage.

On one hand, you have passive outrage.

Passive outrage is the kind of outrage that begins and ends with a Reddit comment. It neither progresses the people nor sets back the surveillance state. It is as placatory as prayer, tricking us into thinking that through our temper we've done our duty. In our hypocrisy, we condemn the inaction of countries for only writing angry letters to the US, when we through our own inaction only write angry comments to the Internet. This is the kind of outrage over whose sum the NSA spooks enjoy a good chuckle, and this is the kind of outrage that accomplishes squat all.

On the other hand, you have active outrage.

Active outrage is outrage channeled into plans and deeds. Those with active outrage either inspire others to action or take action themselves. They are the planners and the doers; the scripters and the actors; the pushers and the movers who, unlike the naysayers, are unwilling to use the imperfection of a plan as an excuse for the inaction of the people. They press on despite those who downplay the situation and disagree with their position. They press on, even when their champion of hope among the people has made their people hopeless. They press on because [they're as mad as hell, and they're not gonna take this anymore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_qgVn-Op7Q).

Some people in this world belong to the former group, and others to the latter group.

The question is, to which group do YOU belong?

I make this distinction as an appeal to those who wish to transcend armchair activism, and to those who wish to make a difference. Let's stop dawdling and start doing, before the NSA goes full Orwell and before there's nothing we CAN be doing. Don't tell yourself ""it's not that bad,"" for it WILL be ""that bad,"" and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Don't tell yourself ""I'm just one person,"" for in each tsunami, every drop of water has its part to play. Don't let a fear of failure obstruct an attempt at change. Don't sit on the sidelines and tell yourself ""this is not my problem"" as before you unfolds that which is everyone's problem: the biggest surveillance system in human history.

Excuses are for the weak, and action is for the strong. Be strong, not weak; take some action, and make no excuses.

Before all action there must first be plans, and before all plans there must first be ideas. Let us then use this thread first as a forum to collect ideas, which can then be developed into plans that function as blueprints with which we, together, can build a better tomorrow. Uncle Sam has for far too long put a Democrat puppet on one hand and a Republican puppet on the other, limiting the public discourse and dividing what was once the United States of America. Let's reunite, let's organize, let's come together instead of drifting apart, and let's once again make our government a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

I myself propose five ideas. They carry with them too many flaws to name and number, and to these flaws I'm sure you guys could draw quick attention. However, it's not the critic who counts. To the problem of unchecked NSA power there is no perfect solution, and something is better than nothing. With that said, here are the ideas I propose.

1. Write letters to the editors of your local newspapers. Is your Congresscritter apathetic to the plight of his or her people? Do this and in these letters express your dissatisfaction in a reasoned way. If enough people do so, some will be published; and if some are published, they will be read. They will be read both by your Congresscritter and by his or her electorate; and if you want to get the attention of the former, you first get the attention of the latter. This also allows you to reach a cohort of politically active people more accustomed to traditional news and for whom ""Reddit"" would sound like a bookstore.

2. Speak with your wallet. Get the most bang for your buck by donating to organizations whose names are backed by a proven track record, such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://supporters.eff.org/donate). Start a crowdfund for causes unfunded, and network with some [powerful signatories for digital rights](http://optin.stopwatching.us) to publicize your cause. If you can't beat money in politics, join money in politics. We the people are greater in number than they the corporations, and with our combined resources we can spark change. Money talks more than mouths, so close your complainers and open your wallets. Don't use as an excuse the fact you're living paycheck to paycheck, for this is more of an investment than a donation. The more unchecked power the government and the corporations share, the less you'll be able to save and the less you'll be able to fight. Five dollars of cash from one percent of Americans adds up to fifteen million in USD. Change is not all-or-nothing, but incremental. If enough people believe as much, political change can begin with pocket change.

3. Organize and participate in nationwide protests. As this is already underway thanks to [Restore the Fourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth), I need not further elaborate.

4. Prepare a master document of links to resources that explain how and why the NSA programs are bad news for American citizens and for the broader world. Your average Joes and Janes are supersaturated with the propagandistic narratives of the mainstream media. They will not be swayed away from hours of narrative overload by a pithy paragraph on why Edward Snowden is a traitor to his government but a hero to his people or on why the media should focus on the leaks, not the leaker. By preparing a master document, disseminating it in discussion threads, and upvoting it on sight, we can both create counterpoints to media narratives and reframe the discussion in a way that benefits the popular interest. Evidence dominates discussion, so let's organize the evidence so we can dominate the discussion.

5. Streamline encryption and computer security procedures to be more convenient and accessible to experts and John Q. Public alike. As I write this, the most effective list for would-be surveillance-busters is probably [PRISM Break](http://prism-break.org), and listed there are around 80 free alternatives to popular programs. Yet, it is rare for even the most dedicated privacy advocates among us to have such a suite installed. This is because most of us have neither the time nor the patience to do so. Far too frequently in the priority system of America do we tolerate injustice to avoid inconvenience, but this flaw need not be our downfall. A technologically inclined person or group of people among you could create for the programs on [PRISM Break](http://prism-break.org) a multi-installer like [Ninite](http://www.ninite.com), or an ISO image of an OS with these programs preinstalled. In combination with a user-friendly usage guide, this could help American citizens reclaim control over both their privacy and their communications. What the government won't give, we must take; and the more convenient the taking, the greater the number of takers.

In a few weeks, on July 4th we call on all individuals to blockade, disrupt and disobey the architecture of repression in their own cities. We act against the surveillance state not because it has overstepped an imaginary line, we rebel against it for the simple fact that it is designed to intimidate, imprison and demoralize us. We act against it because we know that politicians, corporations and the ruling class will never listen or change. We know that it is up to us to be disobedient, that direct action is the only road to freedom.

There is no better time than now to push forth an initiative which calls out the surveillance state for what it is; A web of police, prisons and politicians designed to protect the wealthy. At a time of upheaval and massive repression worldwide we don't ask for permission, we recognize that those who grant us permission are those that spy on us at the same time. The world we fight for is a world free from politicians, states and security agencies.

On July 4th we call on individuals and groups to gather in the busy thoroughfares, parks and squares in your town. We suggest an overnight occupation designed to call out and confront the means in which surveillance is carried out. This could simply be holding a sign in front of a camera, your tactics are only limited by creativity. It is important to not fall into the marching around in circles trap. We hold our space in a busy area on the 4th because this is where people, commerce and surveillance are.

I thought this story should be heard. /r/politics and /r/technology don't allow self posts, so maybe you guys will appreciate it. I welcome suggestions of a more appropriate subreddit as well. 

This all started with my teenage sister, who we will call Anna. Anna lives away from home at a boarding school. She was having some vaginal discomfort, and was concerned that she might have a yeast infection. So, who does a teenage girl turn to for guidance? Her mom who coincidentally has connections to the medical field. 

Anna sent mom a private message on Facebook describing the discomfort she had been having. They talked back and forth (in a text-based and obviously nonsexual manner) trying to 'troubleshoot', so to speak. Anna mentioned itchiness, and so mom thought it might be a rash. 

At the same time, one of mom's friends who we will call Mary, had a rash develop on her arm. She had sent a picture of that to my mom. Mary is 40. A picture of an arm. A 40 year old's arm. 

Mom sent a picture of the rash to Anna and asked her if the irritated region looked similar. Let me emphasize here that **there is only one picture that had been exchanged, and it is of a 40 year old woman who is fully dressed.**

So imagine my poor mother's surprise when she is woken up one morning to a Florida police officer knocking on her door. She nearly faints when she is told she is wanted for mandatory questioning on child pornography charges.

They had an entire dossier on her. Drivers license and birth certificates, photocopies of all of her facebook private messages (even unrelated ones), all sorts of information. Now, obviously it wasn't difficult to explain everything away given that it was transparently obvious that my mother is not a child pornographer. But what concerned me is the police officer mentioned some organization that Facebook and Google cooperates with that can sift through our supposedly private communications for illegal activity and share those communications with local law enforcement. 

There is a certain expectation of privacy in our online communications, and we shouldn't live in fear of being accosted by the police randomly on such heavy charges as child pornography. And some third party organization shouldn't be privy to our personal info under the guise of 'protecting the children'. 

I asked my mom to Freedom of Information her dossier and get the name of the organization, but she refused. She told me in tears that she just wants the whole thing to be over. Her facebook account was suspended for a few weeks but then they gave it back to her. We're not sure if the investigation is officially over, but it looks like not much will come of it.

This is not about effective action at this point. It is about building the bandwagon! Only after we have the numbers can we make the demands. Our focus now should be 80% on building momentum, and 20% on efficacy. 

Sign every petition you can, talk to everyone you know about this, demonstrate to others what actions you've taken, and then explain how they can do the same. Write letters to the editor and use language indicative of a huge movement with many people! Don't tell others that their time isn't worth it.

Furthermore whereas the NSA scandal seems to transcend party lines, other constitutional transgressions (for example, drone assassination of US nationals abroad, or recent attempted gun control laws) are far less clear and far more polarised along party lines. Perhaps bringing up other issues would also ring our death knell. On the other hand I think what I propose here is a reasonable logical step that very few would disagree with on principle.

**NOTE!**: 1. The ad in the link is not at max resolution - 2. The ad will make mention of the r4 website and twitter account at the bottom of the ad

To preemptively address some questions that might pop up ITT:



* Is the New York Times ad campaign associated with the r4 movement? 

It is if your leaders choose it to be.

* Is this the final language of the ad? 

Yes.

* Is the ad TL;DR? 

The New York Times crowd doesn't do TL;DR - neither does our government. And this message is as much directed at them as to anybody else.

* Why the New York Times? 

An ad in the Times is like taking our government's own bullhorn out of its hands and yelling at them through it. We want to interrupt their signal.

* Is **two days** enough time to raise the money for the ad? 

Reddit, you're capable of anything. We helped fund their lying campaigns, we can fund the defense of our rights. Let's do this.


**EDIT:** Some clarifications. The NYT AD CAMPAIGN has been independent of the r4 movement. Through the IRC I approached those who identified themselves as leaders of r4 and I proposed carrying your movement's logo on the ad, so as to give r4 visibility. They liked the idea and they liked the ad. Apparently, though, amongst those who have decided to be vocal, it is not very popular. For this reason then the ad will not carry any mention of r4, so as to not convey a false message that the r4 community at large supports this message.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1371833499.0,,,True,t3_1go6ye,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1go6ye/this_is_the_new_york_times_full_page_ad/,

1371183116.0,29,self.restorethefourth,1gbgq9,Technical details for the PRISM program,32,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1gbgq9/technical_details_for_the_prism_program/,"Today the Guardian [released details on the PRISM program that allow us to paint a fairly complete program on how it works](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/microsoft-twitter-rivals-nsa-requests). Essentially, each company has a ""dropbox""-like service that fulfill NSA requests on individual users given a FISA order.

The Guardian article *VALIDATES* our worst fears, albeit with technical nuances to ensure legality. It's really just about the only viable way to implement this absent an SSL encryption crack (my guess is they're dumping encrypted communications from Room 641A waiting for an encryption weakness to be discovered, that way they'll have *everything*. They're probably not there yet). As Snowden said, you could wiretap the president if you have a personal email.

Here's how it works (this is my opinion as a web developer, not verified details from Snowden leak):

1) Fancy user interface developed by Booz Allen Hamilton. Enter email address (good choice for a unique identifier, used as unique key in many databases).

2) Backend uses curl to send a request to NSA-certified web api on each service shown on the slide. This serves as a legally-binding FISA request either regarding a foreign agent - no court order required - or a domestic agent - secret FISA court order required (see http://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests) and assumed to be fulfilled by the api.

3) Most (all?) companies automatically grant request without appeal as it is a legally binding FISA order. This saves them a ton of money and, hey, it's legal! They have some custom code that allows them to look up a user by their email address - almost guaranteed to be indexed in their database - join it to relevant data sets, and dump it to the ""dropbox""-like system.

4) Kick off NSA equivalent of gearman worker that asynchronously checks contents of ""dropbox""-like service from each company for updates.

5) Fancy frontend shows progress bar, while skinny backend compresses retrieved data into zip file for easy download.

This is the most efficient, cost-effective way to do this without venturing into science fiction, ie storing a mirror of all the data which would be stupid on NSA's part. It still verifies our worst fears and answers the question as to how such a program can cost ""only"" $20 million per year as reported by the slides.

The steps above fulfill all constraints of details provided by Snowden, the government, each of the companies, Glenn Greenwald's/the Guardian's continued updates, and the law itself. The trick is in the legal framework, not the technical details.

The New York Times just reported the results of a Quinnipiac poll that shows a massive recent shift in public opinion: most people think that the U.S. government’s surveillance programs have gone too far in limiting civil liberties.
We are winning. We have a chance to make real and lasting change here, but we need to go all out. That’s why we’re making a definitive video about PRISM and U.S. Government surveillance -- a tool that everyone can use to educate their friends about this issue and drive millions to take action.
Watch the video trailer here and help us get it out there.
The movement to stop mass warrantless surveillance is growing. On July 4th, we organized the largest online privacy protest in history, while thousands took to the streets. But, we need to do more. 
In 2012, we wrote and produced the video that showed the true intent behind the bill and changed the narrative leading up to the January 18th Internet Blackout -- the largest online protest ever. It got more than 6 million views, and became one of the most important tools we had for educating and rallying Internet users to defeat censorship and keep the Internet free. Watch it for yourself.

We need to do the same thing right now for PRISM and the NSA. More people than ever before are becoming aware of the impact that government surveillance has on our rights, but there is a huge amount of confusion, misinformation, and politicking going on. We need a video that explains the programs, puts them in historical context, and moves people to take action.
Check out the trailer, and donate to make this video possible.
If you can't give $5 to this video, but want to see it happen, share our IndieGoGo campaign so more people can see the trailer and help fund a video that the NSA really won’t like.

1373997056.0,25,self.restorethefourth,1ifdxp,I contacted Senator Dianne Feinstein about NSA spying. This was her lame response.,35,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1ifdxp/i_contacted_senator_dianne_feinstein_about_nsa/,"Dear  Mr. -------:
 
I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond. 
 
First, I understand your concerns and want to point out that by  law, the government cannot listen to an American's telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause.  As is described in the attachment to this letter provided by the Executive Branch, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.
 
As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that I believe the oversight we have conducted is strong and effective and I am doing my level best to get more information declassified.  Please know that it is equally frustrating to me, as it is to you, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights.
 
These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, their activities, and those associated with terrorist plots, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming.
 
·  On June 18, 2003, the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified to the House Intelligence Committee that there have been ""over 50 potential terrorist events"" that these programs helped prevent. 
 
·  While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified, I have reviewed the classified testimony and reports from the Executive Branch that describe in detail how this surveillance has stopped attacks. 
 
·  Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by  Najibullah   Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates. 
 
·  Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, the NSA has determined that in early September of 2009, while monitoring the activities of Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based  Najibullah   Zazi .  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked  Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks.  Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested.  Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system. 
 
·  Regarding terrorist David Headley, he was also involved in the planning and reconnaissance of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India that killed 166 people, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, at the behest of Al Qaeda. 
 
Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but laws passed and enacted since 9/11 specifically authorize them.  The surveillance programs are authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which itself was enacted by Congress in 1978 to establish the legal structure to carry out these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans. 
 
The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, the phone call business record program was  reauthorized most recently on May 26, 2011 by a vote of 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House.  The internet communications program was reauthorized most recently on December 30, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House. 
 
Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity, I believe it is important to ensure that the public record now available on these programs is accurate and provided with the proper context.
 
Again, thank you for contacting me with your concerns and comments.  I appreciate knowing your views and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.

I want to see and read the documents he has leaked. But I'm having trouble finding them.

Let's take this approach to restorethefourth. Show America exactly where we're at when it comes to surveillance, and let us decide as a citizen body if our current laws and policies are truly in our best interest, and if the means in place to regulate the accretion and use of arbitrary government power are working or not. Focusing on Snowden or just ingesting commentary will get in the way. If we don't truly know our current state, how can we judge if things have gone too far or not? We can't know. We can't decide. We would be without the information to do so.

**TLDR: post links to leaked documents. Specific files and documents detailing exactly what our current surveillance state looks like and does.** We need transparency, let's create it.

We all need to familiarize ourselves with these so we can more or less spot the shills. 

                                       NSA Internet Talking Points

* Recent Washington Post and Guardian news articles have made allegations about an NSA
Internet collection process that purportedly obtained communications from U.S. companies.
While many of the details are classified, the following points provide an overview of how the
collection process works, consistent with our national security laws.
* These NSA Internet-based collections refer to foreign intelligence collections under
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), codified at 50 U.S.C. ? 1881a.
The articles referenced above contain numerous inaccuracies that imply the United States
Government is spying on Americans. That is just plain false.
* Section 702 is a vital legal tool that Congress reauthorized in December 2012, as part of the
FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act, after extensive hearings and debate. Under Section
702, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) certifies foreign intelligence
collection. There is no secret program involved - it is strictly authorized by a U.S. statute.
* Section 702 allows the Government to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning
Non-U.S. persons (foreign, non-Americans) located outside the United States.
* Section 702 cannot be used to target any U.S. person. Section 702 also cannot be used to
target any person located in the United States, whether that person is an American or a foreigner.
* Section 702 prohibits the Government from ""reverse targeting"" a Non-U.S. Person as a way to
obtain communications of any American or any person located in the United States.
* Section 702 authority does not permit any backdoor collections on Americans. A courtauthorized warrant based on probable cause is, and always has been, required before the
Government can obtain content communications of any U.S. Person (no matter where they are
located), or any person located in the U.S.
* Section 702 allows the government to obtain critical information about foreign adversaries that
threaten Americans and U.S. interests. Section 702 collections provide intelligence about:
* Terrorists' plots, including operational planning and financial support.
* Cyber threats to the United States, including potential attacks to computer networks.
* Weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation networks.
* Section 702 collections are subject to rigorous, ongoing oversight by the FISA Court, the
Executive Branch, and Congress. For example:
* The FISA Court must approve Section 702 collections to ensure that only Non-U.S.
Persons are targeted. The FISA Court also ensures that any incidentally acquired
information about U.S. persons is scrubbed and purged.
* Every 60 days, the Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence
conduct detailed on-site reviews to ensure compliance with Section 702.
* The House and Senate Intelligence Committees conduct regular oversight of the
intelligence collection under the FISA Amendments Act.
* The unauthorized disclosure of information about this critical legal tool puts our national
security in grave danger, puts Americans at risk of terrorist and cyber attacks, and puts our
military intelligence resources in danger of being revealed to our adversaries.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1gcona,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1gcona/leaked_nsas_talking_points_defending_nsa/,

However, just because we're being a bit 'unique' doesn't mean people give a shit. To make them give a shit, we have to be above reproach. Please make sure to check and double check the following.


* Did you sleep? 

If you're awake reading this, finish it, and get to bet ASAP! You need to be AWAKE BRIGHT AND EARLY! :) I'll bring coffee. You'll probably be amazed if you meet me. ~~I'm a quiet blond girl.~~ Compulsive liar. 

* Are your facts correct? 

Example: I just read a flier that people are going crazy upvoting to hand out, that talks about the Utah Data Center. Apparently, you guys are misinformed. **The center hasn't opened yet.**

* Spell check your signs

Example: I just saw a sign where someone misspelled ""Essential"" as ""essencial"" **ARE YOU SERIOUS?!**

* Know your laws

Not all states allow you to record in certain areas. Check out /r/amifreetogo /r/legaladvice **/r/assert_your_rights**

* Is your sign factual? 

Just saw one that says ""NSA READS ALL OF YOUR TEXT MESSAGES."" 

That's bullshit. Stop making shit up. 


* Are you prepared to be arrested?

Really? Do you have a lawyer on speed dial and your phone encrypted pursuant People V Diaz? 

* Are you going to be hydrated? 

No one wants you to pass out. I'm not going to carry your sorry ass if you scream too much

* Do you have transportation and a contingency? 

If no, get one fast guys. 

* Are you wearing a mask?

If yes, please don't. Hiding is immature and the media will just say ""Some idiots in a park from 4chan screamed at people today""

* Are you prepared to fight and be violent? 

If yes, stay home. 

* Did you actually call Congress yet? 

If no, you're not an activist, you're a lazy bastard trying to change history to feed your own ego. 

* Did you study and of the official or unofficial talking points before hand?

If not, better google those out or search this reddit for talking points

* Do you know your history?

Can you tell me who General Alexander is? Thomas Drake? Michael Hayden? John Ashcroft? Do you know what TIA stands for? Do you know your laws? Patriot section 215 and FAA 2008 Sec 702. 

* Do you know that this isn't about PRISM? 

Example: Just saw one guy saying ""PRISM IS ANTI-AMERICAN! FREE SNOWDEN"" Bro...do you even know what you're doing here? Better do your home work real fast. 

* Do you know the bill of rights by heart? 


If not, you can still rally..but why the fuck don't you? I mean honestly....Personally, I can sing the first and 4th and have done so drunk in hand cuffs xD


**Update:**

IMSI-catchers (Fake cell towers) will be used by the NYPD and probably D.C police and others. Be aware of this. 

Red Phone Android App. 

&amp;

Textsecure (Texting app)

Are your friend. USE THEM!

Also, make sure to have bamboozer app set up and your phone encrypted, since they can legally search it after an arrest pursuant People v Diaz. 

Also, be extremely wary of anyone asking for your email. Set up a burner. Also, be careful sharing your facebook. You never know who is a narc. Be wary but not paranoid of ""journalists"" (especially with HD Hi-res lenses) standing on the outside of the crowds. They could be (but don't be paranoid) feds.

First, I get HTTPS failure that it is only valid for the following:

Fine, who wants to pay for certs.



Second the Google map displays fine, but none of the placemarkers show. I suspect it may be related to the following jquery request:

This properly redirects to the non HTTPS location.

This seems to be a result of the following call:

    $.getJSON('/protests.json', function(data){
        map.plotStaticMarkers(data);
        }); 

According to the [jquery.getJSON reference](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/), under ""Additional Notes"", this call is subject to the [same origin policy(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy), a security restriction, which prevents a request to a different domain or protocol.

We plan to invite law professors, history professors, politicians (R &amp; D), and local activist organizations (lib &amp; con, including Tea Party &amp; ACLU) to speak at our rally.

We want the rally to include speeches from all the people and organizations listed above, obviously. We also plan to pass around postcards, pre-addressed to the White House, with a short statement opposing the trampling of the 4th Amendment. There will be additional space for people to write their own messages and sign their names. 

We would like to have all politicians present sign a pledge to oppose legislation that would diminish privacy or violate the 4th Amendment; to be maximally transparent (within the bounds of law) about government efforts to violate the 4th; and to work to protect whistleblowers that reveal illegal or unethical behavior within government.

We would also like to distribute a small brochure or card that explains how people can use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), [StartPage](https://startpage.com/), [PGP](http://www.gnupg.org/), [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/about/), etc. to better protect their privacy.

We would also like to distribute stickers that people can put on their cars, laptops, etc. with a simple message -- maybe just ""Restore the 4th"" with the [URL](http://www.restorethefourth.net/).

We plan to heavily promote the event on social media and also send press releases to every local media outlet, major and minor. We're also trying to get an Op-Ed in the local paper. 

We want to make sure everyone at the rally is on the same page. What do you think of these?

* Nonpartisan - use discretion, don’t appear to be anti-Obama or anti-Bush; be pro-freedom

* Focus on this issue - please no signs, stickers, etc. for other causes or issues

* The issue is the Fourth Amendment violations stemming from the Patriot Act -- violations of privacy -- search &amp; seizure -- right to be left alone

* There are realistic alternatives: we have an existing legal structure that can deal with terror and crime; we don’t need to erode rights; Franklin quote; etc.

I think it is important to clarify what is happening. The mods and contributors have taken to organizing in IRC for our planning and discussions.

The fact is, we've spent the past several days with multiple meetings to get a document hammered out, websites built, a bullet list of goals and actions approved, and we have created logos and formed internal structure. It's been very organized and very fast.

If anyone is caught unaware by the emphasis on using IRC as a planning base, let me extend my apologies on behalf of the group. This was never the intention. Meetings and invitations to join IRC have been announced, but in the clutter and confusion of reddit there were unavoidable, there were some who missed the memo.

The fact is that no matter how we structure the moderation here, it was impossible to do the work that was needed quickly enough to remain relevant without having live, focused conversations. Reddit itself just wasn't practical for planning purposes, though it was excellent at getting us attention and support. This was especially true while we were struggling to adapt to the sudden growth and spam that occurred.

I welcome you to join us, as per the sidebar our meetings are at 8pm if you wish to be briefed on what is happening. You may also join the chat at any time and contribute, there is always plenty going on.

So let me start out by saying i'm no activist. i have had no experience in the past with getting involved in anything like this but, as a technologist, have been an avid follower of where digital freedom meets politics (SOPA, CISPA, etc.). This is something i feel passionately about, and something i'd really like to be a part of. 

Here's the thing -- I've been following this movement rather closely for the past 6 hours, and, honestly, without proper leadership and resource management, i sadly don't see it amounting to very much.

We need leadership that can protect the message, keep our voice focused, and safe from dissenters. A unified voice is WAY louder than just a bunch of people yelling.

Even people claiming to support the RT4 movement have already been diluting the message with statements that detract from the main idea. Along with leadership to safeguard from this, i feel like we need teams -- web team, design team, protest coordinating teams, spokespersons/teams, etc. -- to make the most efficient use of resources.

With all that said, i don't know what the best way to establish that leadership and those teams are. I'd like to see what the community thinks about it.

If we are trying to reach out to large groups of new people, instead of preaching to the choir, these could be good venues. In many cities you can sign up to march in the parades. Politicians and their campaign supporters often walk in them with their political signs. If we march in them with our signs, it shouldn't be any different.

I do also want to say that if we do this tactic, we should think about the audiences where we are and think about how to make sure we don't alienate them. We don't want to seem intimidating or scary to some toddler who wanted to watch the horses walk down the street. I think that doing something like handing out red, white, and blue pinwheels with a good slogan on them could be very effective.

Dear Friend,

 

Thank you for writing to me with regard to the NSA intelligence programs.  It is extremely important that we ***strike the right balance between protecting the privacy of individuals while also protecting our national security.***  

In doing so, Congress should ensure that ***individual privacy concerns*** (not rights??) 

are given ***full consideration*** (not protection.. got it) 

and that we protect the Constitutional right of due process. (but forget about protecting the 1st 10 Amendments...) 

 

I have always been a ***proponent of transparency*** 
(While supporting Obama's Presidency who might be the least transparent administration in history?) 

within the government and I can assure you that this belief extends to the gathering of intelligence. As a matter of fact, I recently signed onto a bill that will reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court charged with overseeing requests for surveillance warrants. Specifically, this bill will create a Special Advocate who will be responsible for following FISA Court proceedings; an appellate review that will review FISA Court decisions on appeals; disclosure requirements by the Attorney General and reporting requirements from the Special Advocate. (I cannot find the exact text of this bill, but I will take a politicans word for it that it is in the best interest of the American people, which least be honest... it probably isnt...)

The American people deserve no less.  I look forward to continuing this discussion in the future. 

 

Thank you again for writing to express your concerns, and I hope that you keep in touch with my office regarding future legislation.  For more information on this and other important issues, please visit my website at http://gillibrand.senate.gov and sign up for my e-newsletter.

Tonight I will be attending my local town council meeting with the hope of getting them to vote on, pass, and sign a non-binding resolution denouncing the use of domestic spying and affirming that our town stands by the Fourth Amendment. Here is the full text of the resolution:

&gt;Jonestown Borough Council

&gt;Non-Binding Resolution

&gt;Expressing the sense of the Jonestown Borough Council, and the constituents this body represents, in matters relating to the May 2013 revelations of a domestic surveillance program in place and used by the United States Federal Government.


&gt;________________________________________

&gt;IN THE COUNCIL OF JONESTOWN BOROUGH

&gt;July 2, 2013

&gt;Mr. MahoneyRed, resident of Jonestown, submitted the following resolution for consideration by 
the Council.


&gt;________________________________________

&gt;RESOLUTION

&gt;Whereas:	Details were made public about the National Security Agency conducting massive drag-net style surveillance of United States Citizens

&gt;Whereas:	The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of The United States of America states, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

&gt;Whereas:	Publicly available information about the PRISM program, and other methods of domestic surveillance, have shown a complete lack of oversight regarding the issuance of warrants for search and seizure of personal property.

&gt;Whereas:	Our duly elected representatives within the Federal Government have taken no steps towards responding to, or questioning the actions of the NSA.

&gt;Whereas:	The actions of domestic spying and broad electronic surveillance by the NSA pose a major breach and violation of Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution of The United States of America.

&gt;Whereas:	The Declaration of Independence states, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

&gt;Whereas:	The Declaration of Independence also states, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it…”: Now, therefore, be it 

&gt;Resolved, 	That is the sense of this Council that:

&gt;1.	A broad based drag net seizure and storage of every individual citizen’s private electronic data is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of The United States of America.

&gt;2.	Such a violation is intolerable to the people governed by this Council.

&gt;3.	It is the duty and responsibility of our duly elected Federal Representatives to act appropriately on behalf of the people to stop this gross violation of Fourth Amendment rights.

&gt;4.	It is the duty and responsibility of officials within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to deliberate and, if so determined, to echo the people’s desire for an end to domestic spying.

&gt;5.	The people of the Jonestown area are guaranteed to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unwarranted searches and seizures, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States of America.

&gt;6.	In declaring this resolution, this Council affirms the right of the people to alter or abolish a form of government that has become destructive of the people’s certain unalienable rights.

&gt;Signed on this day ____________________, Jonestown Borough Council Members and Jonestown Mayor:

My main hope is for this idea to spread. I want it to spread all throughout my area and across the Commonwealth (Yeah, PA is weird not being a state and all...) and eventually make its way to the capital. I hope to see various state governments adopting similar resolutions in a true show of public opinion, not the opinion the MSM tells us we should have.

Some will view this as a waste of time and effort. That it bears no real weight. I say it has about the same weight as an internet petition, if not an ounce or two more.

If you agree with what you read here, please feel free to cross-post, copy/pasta, or share it with as many people as you can. Community involvement will be key to fighting for our rights.

We organized the first protest against SOPA, http://americancensorship.org/ ... I've been working all weekend on a coalition response to the NSA spying leaks, but I wanted to get this idea out to everyone on /r/restorethefourth.  This is from a friend, Matt Wood, who's on the DC team at Free Press:

""Hill offices definitely are open during recess, when members are out of DC but staffs are still on duty.  With the holiday on Thursday, there's a chance they will be closed or lightly staffed not just on the 4th, but also the 3rd and/or 5th as well. So the earlier that week the better for calls, most likely.  On Monday the 1st and Tuesday the 2nd.""

Tuesday's a better day for a launch.  It will give larger sites one workday to get their ducks in a row for a big push.

Then, the cool thing is that members of Congress will be in their home districts.  We can request to meet with them over the recess and post the dates and times (that could happen here on a Reddit thread) then drive people to those meetings as a secondary ask after they email or call Congress.

For members of Congress that support us on the issue, we can plan local events with them as they make appearances at municipal fourth of July celebrations.

For members of Congress on the wrong side, we can protest any public appearances they make over the holiday weekend.

Either way, a July 2nd launch lets you link an online protest to the holiday, but also bury Congress in phonecalls without just going to voicemail in empty offices.   One idea (which maybe has come up already, sorry for not following more closely) participating sites could run the fourth amendment on their front page for a day, with an ask to call Congress and sign up for in-district meetings / local protests.

I figured I'd make a post for people who might be interested. It outlines some technical approaches and tradeoffs I make to retain some semblance of privacy in this modern Internet Age.

Our current administration has made it abundantly clear they could care less about the constitutionality of the Intel community's collection methods. For those who have been living in a cave (and ironically would then have nothing to fear from this), the NSA Prism program in cooperation with the FBI gives the government basically unfettered access to private information you have stored at many of America's major tech players.

The full extent of these programs is slowly being revealed, and the FISA court seems perfectly willing to allow ongoing telecommunication surveillance on American citizens who have done nothing wrong. They collect and store your information in bulk, but hold back on analyzing it. Once they go through [the arduous process](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/17/in-first-nsa-interview-obama-cant-confirm-if-courts-ever-rejected-spying-requests/) of legally gaining permission to investigate you, they can retroactively analyze what they have collected. It's a major loophole, but it works.

What's worse is many of the tech giants (Google, Apple, Verizon) have been playing ball silently since 2009, only pretending to care when a national PR embarrassment is thrown in their lap.

So to the point, I've been slowly removing my dependency on Google and other Prism choke points.

There's a great site I discovered from Hacker News: [Prism Break](http://www.prism-break.org). It outlines many solid alternatives for web services and computing tools that are unlikely to cooperate with Prism for a long time (if ever). As with most software, there are trade offs between the ease of use in mature commercial products and their privacy guarantees.

This post is about some of the recent changes I've made with respect to Prism-Break and my own research on Hacker News, Reddit, and general insider knowledge gained from working with smart technical people over the years. You'll notice a recurring theme of evaluating ease of use with security, and many of my decisions actually err on the side of usage, despite the tone of this post.

**Web Browser**:

I recently switched from Google Chrome back to Firefox. I always liked Chrome because of how quickly it rendered pages, particularly Javascript heavy pages, and made tab management easier. The web developer toolbox is second to none. Although I must admit, Mozilla Firefox has stayed very competitive with them. There is a negligible performance drop off, but it's barely noticeable and nothing significant. You can't really trust Chrome unfortunately, even with aggressive privacy settings (no analytics, etc.) .
Firefox is not as malware/exploit bulletproof as Chrome, but it is close, and the open source nature makes it a very attractive alternative. I NEVER save passwords through the browser and always tell it never to ask. Both Chrome and Firefox are well know for storing passwords in plain text.

**Web Browser Add-ons**:

Not exactly a browser add-on, but it does help with security.

I pay $80/year for an [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) subscription to [Mullvad](http://www.mullvad.net), which I discovered reading a comment thread on Reddit. They are based in Sweden and retain absolutely no information about you. They could give a fuck.

The OpenVPN standard encrypts all outbound communication from the originating device using layer 2 SSL. Traffic appears as normal HTTPS.
This is different than other VPN technologies that use with IPSEC, the presence of which is easy to detect and thus limits any plausible deniability. It's also different than a simple web proxy that does not necessarily offer encryption to prevent ISP monitoring/throttling, and often only handles HTTP or SOCKS traffic, which is often slower. Mullvad is fast enough that I've just gotten in the habit of leaving it running at all times.
Plus it never get old having sites show me geo-aware ads in Swedish.

The trade off is it's a bit more expensive than many of the web proxy providers. However, there are certain [fringe benefits](https://mullvad.net/en/faq.php#anon_torrent) to having completely anonymous web traffic. Don't hate the player hate the game.

The fact that traffic is difficult to distinguish between secure web browsing and OpenVPN has made it an attractive countermeasure to the great firewall of China and other censorship technologies. There is a constant leap-frogging battle between those governments and OpenVPN vendors like Mullvad. It's reminiscent of the old PC gaming piracy protection vs. CD burning wars before everyone started using Steam.

**Web Search**:

I have configured Firefox to use [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com) as my default Search engine. They have a similar don't-give-a-fuck privacy policy to Mullvad (they're in the NE), and route all your searches anonymously through Google. It's not 100% equivalent to US Google, but it has not let me down yet. It's about 95% equivalent from my weeks testing it. There has only been one obscure search for this weird video it couldn't find. Not a big deal. For most of my research, it hits the mark. There is an extra half second of latency in the response, but I can deal with that.

They have a plugin for Firefox, but I've configured it to perform address bar searches by
A) opening a new tab
B) typing 'about:config'
C) Searching for the property 'keyword.url'
D) Change it to 'https://www.startpage.com/do/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;q='

**Maps**:

You're basically screwed here. Nothing works like Google Maps. They are echelons past their competitors. I can say that having used OpenLayers and ArcGIS for some technical work in the past. Plus we all remember how good a job [Apple did with their iphone 5 maps](http://gizmodo.com/5945082/apple-knows-apple-maps-suck-right-now-but-says-itll-get-better).

Just make sure you're not logged into your Google Account and preferably running OpenVPN when you do your search.

**Instant Messaging**:

This is the first example you'll see where I lean more in the ease of use than the security.

When I'm going to run IM, I use encrypted Gtalk over [Adium](https://adium.im/).

Mainly because it would take too much effort to convince all my friends to use to a protocol that allowed true point-to-point encryption that's off the record. I use SSL between my host and the GTalk server, but Google still has access on their servers to the plain text messages (even if it's OTR I suspect, no proof though). Moreover, your chat partner may not be using it, in which case all those messages are still visible downstream in plaintext.

The only good alternative is just to stop using it so damn much. This is a work in progress for me.

**Video VoIP**:

Skype sucks. It really does. They haven't been the same since Microsoft acquired them. What's interesting is the tool was built with pretty impressive reverse-engineering countermeasures, and goes through great lengths to circumvent NAT in order to make your calls. Unfortunately there are known backdoors where third parties can ease drop. It is not to be trusted anymore for secure conversations.
I don't make video VoIP that frequently anymore, but if I had to I would try out Prism-Break's suggestion for [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/). It looks promising.

I would also avoid Facetime like the plague, simply because I think Apple has zero credibility for protecting your privacy (just as Microsoft and Google).


**Social Networking**:

Not much you can do here if you enjoy the major players like Facebook. Similar to instant messaging, you're limited by the people you want to communicate with. I'm reasonable careful these days about what I post on FB/LinkedIn/Google+ when I use them (which is infrequent). And I don't mean just what is publicly available to my contacts. I mean everything.

I personally don't have a problem with these services and think they add a lot of value. I try to keep really personal stuff off them, but that guarantee is a bit naive. I know I've slipped up a few times, and FB has access to some pretty funny private messages. I mostly enjoy the read-only features of these sites, and rarely contribute, but that's not really good enough.

Just by having an account with some basic information and friend links, they can learn a lot about you. For example, one of my good friends likes to check all of us in on Facebook when we go to a listed restaurant. That's not even something I opted into, but FB gets to learn facts about me based solely on that association. I've met girls who later looked me up through FB friends and sent weird unsolicited PMs. We've all been there. Facebook, and thus the government, has access to all that shit. They even have a whole suite of [creepy analytics that can tell if you're gay](http://americablog.com/2013/03/facebook-might-know-youre-gay-before-you-do.html).

**Cloud Storage**:

This is one of the more interesting ones. There are so many choices for secure backups, but it's difficult to find a be-all-end-all solution that satisfies everyone.

I personally use per-file encryption on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). It's the same storage backend as Dropbox, but I encrypted everything first by hand and don't bother with file sync.

My methods are simple but require quite a bit of micro-mangement. I run each file through a Mac OSX utility named crypt from the command line before I post it to my S3 buckets. The utility defaults to AES-256 bit encryption and is really easy to use. [This custom version](http://encryption-utilities.s3.amazonaws.com/crypt_modified.tar.gz) I modified for OSX cleans up the command entry a bit from the authors original version.

I will say there are very fancy solutions out there for users who demand a bit more.

Dropbox is really slick with file sync and ease of use, but everything is unencrypted on Amazon. Unacceptable.

To counter this, some people supplement Dropbox with a tool named [EncFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS). It transparently encrypts/decrypts file contents from any directory, which works with Dropbox, but you need to be a bit of power user to set it up. There's also [Tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/), but it supposedly doesn't handle incremental syncs well  and doesn't work on Windows. One interesting solution I looked at was using [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html) to do cross-device backups and syncing, but I wanted something that backs up to the cloud, not just my own devices.
There really is no easy-to-use solution that efficiently synchronizes files and is secure. Dropbox + EncFS is close, but not exactly easy to use.

**Documents**:

This one has been difficult. There aren't too many good solutions out there. I have looked at [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/docs/) before and they offer a lot. It's hard to imagine it easier to use than Google Docs though. [Prezi](http://prezi.com/) is cool for building presentations that don't look like PowerPoint vomit.

I really don't have a good suggestion here. If this became a frequent requirement, I'd probably create a new Google Account with some bogus personal information that wasn't associated with any of my previous Google Accounts. Although they could very easily correlate something written in one of my documents with a best-guess at a related Google account (also based on IP logging). Google's latest terms of service and privacy agreements allows for these types of cross-service analytics.

**Media Publishing**:

I use [Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery) for everything.

**Email Services**:

Another interesting one. If I use an anonymous service like [FastMail](http://www.fastmail.fm), but 70% of my emails go to Gmail recipients, am I really hiding anything from Google?

At the very least I'm not going to make it easy for them. So far I've been impressed with FastMail. The UI feels comfortably like Gmail, except much more responsive. It offers competitive features with Gmail like anti-spam, full text search, achieving, filtering and custom DNS. There are no ads, but it is a pay service.

**Email Desktop Clients**:

I haven't done this for quite some time. If I had to, I'd probably try [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/).

**Email Encryption**:

I don't bother with this. 99% of people don't want to fool with it. Just like with Dropbox + EncFS for file storage, most encrypted email systems require people who are somewhat technically competent. It's an unreasonable expectation.

**Online Transactions**:

Sadly I still use PayPal. A lot of people are attacking this problem right now (Stripe, Square, etc.) No one has come out victorious yet as the PayPal killer, but I am waiting anxiously.

[BitCoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) is a really cool technology that's gaining some traction, but many merchants don't yet accept it, and some of the security around wallet controls leaves a lot to be desired. It's interesting to read about how the currency works from a technical standpoint. It has resisted many attempts at exploitation and bot-mining, but the major weakness appears to be wallet security.

**Android**:

I dumped the NSA conspirator Verizon in favor of [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/) running over T-Mobile infrastructure. This involved forcefully unlocking my phone and installing a root kit to gain superuser permissions. If you're thinking of switching from Verizon to one of their competitors, don't try to port your phone unless you're prepared for USB debugging, ROM installation and a $15 unlock code (depending on the phone and whether or not you're willing to dig with a HEX editor). I learned a lot, but I wouldn't wish it on other people who just want their phone to work.
I run [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) 7.2 for my Android ROM. I have no outbound encryption through for any of the common apps (Google Maps, Reddit, etc) so this is a weak point for me right now.


**Operating System**:

I run Mac OSX. It's just too smooth and efficient for technical work. I can't give it up.
Linux is nice with respect to production scenarios, but the user-experience of most of the x-windows managers just doesn't compare to OSX.
I'm very careful about what updates I perform though, and run [Little Snitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) so that I can approve and monitor any outbound connections my machine tries to make. It's technically possible Apple has baked some dubious reporting into the core apsd services, but there's not much more I can do without handicapping the machine.

**Merkley**

Dear James, 

  

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about the National
Security Administration and recent revelations about its widespread
surveillance programs.  I appreciate hearing from you.  

  

Like you, I have significant concerns about the intelligence community
collecting information about Americans' telephone calls, emails, and
other records.  That is why I was deeply disappointed when the Senate
voted to extend without new safeguards three expiring provisions of the
PATRIOT Act that allow the government to access medical records, phone
calls, emails, and library records.  Similarly, I joined 22 of my
colleagues in voting against the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments
Act that authorized the wiretapping of communications of foreigners who
could be communicating with an American citizen, but did not provide
sufficient safeguards for Americans' privacy.   

  

While we must undoubtedly provide law enforcement with the tools
necessary to keep Americans safe, we must also protect Americans' most
fundamental constitutional rights.  We can both protect our privacy and
also maintain a high standard of national security.  

  

As you may know, I recently introduced the Ending Secret Law Act with
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) that would require the Obama Administration to
declassify information about top-secret court rulings that have
interpreted what type of spying is allowable under the law.  In
particular, the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court has issued opinions interpreting the breath of surveillance
allowable under controversial provisions of both the PATRIOT Act and
the FISA Amendments Act.  This past December, when Congress was
considering whether to extend the FISA Amendments Act program for
another five years, I offered this idea as an amendment to that
legislation before the full Senate.  While the amendment was
unfortunately defeated, please know I will continue pushing my
colleagues to support additional oversight of the intelligence
community including the de-classification of these important court
rulings. 

  

Thank you, again, for contacting me.  I hope you will continue to keep
me informed about the issues that matter most to you. 


**Bonamici**

Thank you for contacting me about the National Security Agency's (NSA)
electronic surveillance programs. I appreciate hearing from you. 

 

News of these surveillance programs broke when Edward Snowden, a
private contractor working with the NSA, provided classified documents
to The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers. According to
reports, one program collects information about when and where some
cell phone customers, both U.S. citizens and non-citizens, made phone
calls and what numbers they called.  Another program, named PRISM,
gives the NSA access to information about non-U.S. users of some web
products.  Under PRISM, it is possible for U.S. citizens'
communications to be collected incidentally.  The Justice Department
has since charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government
property.  

 

It is both a difficult and highly important task to balance our
national security and civil liberties. These events provide us with an
opportunity to engage in a meaningful discussion about domestic
surveillance programs, national security concerns, and the right to
privacy. I am very concerned, however, that these programs may not
comply with federal law or the Fourth Amendment, and the Congress
should conduct an expedited and thorough review of these programs to
ensure the constitutional rights of Americans are not being violated.
Please know that I will carefully follow this issue and will keep your
input in mind should related legislation come before Congress.

 

Thank you again for writing to me about this important issue.  If you
would like to know more about my work in Congress, please sign up for

Here's an idea.,24,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1ie942/you_guys_want_to_do_something_heres_an_idea/,"The problem now seems to be centralization of protest and public understanding of the issues involving the NSA and the immunity of the government and large corporations which work closely with them (in respect to many things, but in this case specifically our personal communications).

Let's help to bring some serious awareness to this issue. We have the brute force of whole populations. A HUGE portion of the world's people share the outrage I see articulated and reinforced on Reddit throughout the day, every day since Snowden popped the lid off of those files.

Let's create a website to analyze the source documents. A kind of Wikipedia for relevant source material widely misunderstood or under-reported. Let's put the words in the faces of the public, piece by piece, in a way that is easily understood. No spin, no editorials. We don't need the frills that slant the news we're all so used to. The visceral response will be enough.


**WHAT WE NEED:**

* A domain and a web designer/master. Someone that will maintain the site's morality, usability and security.

* A name. Something that will last (not saying that Restore the Fourth Review would be a bad name, just that something a tad more subtle may be a better idea)

* A system. I envision a website which allows a signup for anonymous members. We will need an application embedded on the site which randomly assigns new members links and access to certain threads. There is a line or passage which is the subject of the thread, and it is the responsibility of those assigned to the thread to discuss and translate the passage, and point out the implications and context of the passage in a way that makes sense to people. If the members assigned to the thread think that the passages are worth knowing about, they alert an-- again-- randomly assigned moderator, who compiles the relevant information/citations, comes up with a synopsis (perhaps each alert will need to be reviewed by many moderators), and then sends the information on to a mailing list with every possible news outlet. 

We should have a widget on every page of the website which includes the contact information for any politician or influential person in the user's locality. Pre-written letters, skype links with the politician's number. Hell, print-friendly address stickers.

The idea needs some fine tuning, I know. But I think it's worth trying. This isn't going to work without some sincere enthusiasm. Now I want to hear from you, Reddit-- who has some ideas?

If we hope to make this movement into something people will stop and take notice of, we are going to have to discuss why yesterday's protest was so lackluster.  If we aren't able to criticize, we are done, period. Anyhooo...

I believe these are the reasons Occupy was so much more successful than Rt4.  

* A broader and more urgent cause:

Most people recoil at the idea of their emails/search history being read by the government, but it might not be the type of thing they will take to the streets over, considering corporations have been doing this for over a decade. 

Occupy focused on an issue that effects the core problems of our time: the dominating power of Wall Street over democracy (including erosion of constitutional liberties), austerity, income inequality and unemployment to name a few. 

Remember that the people suffering the worst in our society don't have email addresses.  In comparison to other social upheavals around the world, Rt4 is very much a first world problem.  

* Huge numbers:  

They didn't need to plan for a month ahead of time, they were able to inspire large numbers immediately and spontaneously with far less effort and organization.  

* Sustained Commitment: 

Occupy had daily protests for 6 months, which demonstrated commitment and sacrifice.  Protesting for a couple hours on your day off shows very little effort and commitment.  We don't make much of an impact if the people we are trying to protest are home with their families.  We need to be a constant presence.  

* Decentralized leadership:

Occupy didn't have a protest schedule, PR training documents, dress codes, rules and organizers making big decisions, it was a group effort.  The kind of top down structure used for Rt4 made you feel more like you were working for someone elses agenda than taking action for your own. 

I find this message on the top of the page to be a big turn off: ""Thanks everyone! We'll contact about next steps in the coming days!""  I makes me feel like a pawn or a lackey. 

Controlling your message is good for keeping chaos to a minimum, but rules also come at a cost of passion and intensity.

---

First off, sorry this ""announcement"" thread wasn't made sooner, and for the general shortcomings in communication and organization most of you have probably already noticed. Fortunately any ""drama"" that contributed to this has been over for about a week now and we've spent much of the time since bringing all this together. Consequently our organizational deficiencies have grown smaller and smaller, and should continue to shrink over the next few days until it's no longer an issue. Some of the ways we can all help with this will be brought up this evening, and feel free to bring up your own.

Moving to the topic at hand: The national organizers and the administrators of the daily IRC meetings (as well as the /r/restorethefourth moderators, and the administrators of the social networking pages) have decided to host the daily meetings on reddit instead of on IRC, and we will continue to do so every evening at 8pm EDT right here in /r/restorethefourth, in a daily thread created by a moderator just prior to 8. If you were around here yesterday, you already noticed this change (which is why ""announcement"" was in quotes), but I made this thread to advertise the change more and to discuss why it was made.

The IRC channel(s), meanwhile, will remain open and continue to be a useful way to chat in real time about whatever's on your mind. It just won't be used for the daily meetings or other scheduled events. Chatting about ongoing meetings in the IRC is fine of course, but if you want what you discussed on record for the purposes of general future reference, I recommend at least summarizing it in the reddit thread as well, after the fact if necessary.

**Reasons for this move**

- **Not everyone has an IRC client or is comfortable using IRC.** Of course, not everyone has a reddit account either, and no medium will be familiar to everyone. But reddit.com is much more ubiquitous than snoonet.org, and allows those who aren't participating directly to at least view the thread from their browser and see what's happening, even afterwards.

- **IRC is a transient medium.** Everything posted to an IRC channel is lost to you when you log out, unless you have a persistent client. Even if you do, or if you copy it all before logging out, putting everything on record would require finding another place to host it and tediously reformatting what you copied. reddit allows everything to be aggregated quickly and easily, and the OP of the meeting thread will do this by linking to and summarizing primary comments there.

- **IRC is made for small numbers of people.** Using reddit will allow us to discuss different topics simultaneously without ""interrupting eachother"", and allows any individual to spend more reading and discussing the subject most relevant to him or her, all without any top-down direction.

- **Openness, transparency, and ease of access.** By using a platform that keeps things on record and allows a greater number of participants, more people can see the decisions being made and the work being done, easing communication (and access to information) between those doing related work, and leading to a higher level of accountability and interactivity on the parts of national organizers and other coordinators.

Thanks for reading all this and thank you to all of our contributors. Please keep up the good work and feel free to ask any questions you have about this change.

----

**Q) What is ""Restore the Fourth""?**

A) We are a non partisan group of concerned citizens dedicated to restoring our fourth amendment rights. We come from all across the political spectrum, but what we all have in common is this: The right to be secure in our persons against unlawful search and seizures is a basic human right; a right that has been violated severely by our current government. 

**Q) Why focus on the fourth amendment?**

We care about all of our rights as citizens. However, the same people who would fight against the fourth amendment would also fight against our other rights as well. Indeed, if we cannot be secure in our persons from unlawful search and seizures, then how can we enjoy any of our other rights? 

By focusing our efforts on one issue we unite ourselves with a common purpose that brings us together regardless of our differing politics and philosophy. This allows many who would disagree on other matters to join forces and stay focused toward a common goal.

**Q) What can I do to help?**

A) First of all, spread the word. The more people who know about this movement, the better. Secondly, [Look Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rtforganizers) for a list of planned protests, and please support those which are taking place in your local area.

I deleted my reddit account some time ago, but I decided to re-register in light of current events. 

Want to do something easy, fast, and effective to help restore our right to privacy as American citizens? Write the representatives from your state a short message urging them to stand up for our rights. It's super easy. Just Google search for who they are, go to their website (it's generally the first link), and look for a link that says ""contact me"" or ""email.""

Most effective is a positive message encouraging your senators and representatives to take action. Here's an example of what I wrote to Senators Alexander and Corker of Tennessee:

""Senator Alexander,

I'm a Tennessee resident proudly serving in the United States Air Force as an ICBM operator stationed at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming. I have recently become aware of the Verizon wiretapping scandal as well as the revelation of the PRISM documents by Mr. Snowden. Frankly, I am disgusted by what I have learned.

When I joined the USAF, I swore to uphold and defend the constitution of the United States, but I can see that the government that we both serve has decided that the rights we hold dear can be swept aside without the knowledge or consent of the American people. 

I am obviously discouraged. When I accepted a commission as an ICBM officer, I don't have to tell you the massive responsibility that befell me; I am well aware of the consequences of even minor violations of the safety rules or procedures involving our country's nuclear weapons. You have a similarly awesome responsibility, that of safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the American people. 

I urge you to do all that you can to fight the NSA's unconstitutional invasion into our lives. The surveillance doesn't need to be ""scaled back"" or ""investigated,"" it needs to be stopped, now. 

The fourth amendment is in place for a good reason. I do not accept the notion that we must surrender all privacy in order to gain some security. Benjamin Franklin has been quoted on the subject, and I'm sure you're aware of what he said. I want the country that I defend to be a country worth defending.

I look forward to seeing your name on the news as a stalwart defender of our liberties.

AirPowerHooah, 1st LT, USAF""

DO: Urge your representatives to action, encourage, recommend, and discuss.

DON'T: Threaten violence, insult, or degrade.

The comment:

&gt;I made a post in /r/politics yesterday about this very thing. I suggested we start with writing a piece of legislation or a concept thereof detailing a right to privacy on a free and open internet. We'd have to get the senators who actually care about things like Sanders, Warren, and Paul to endorse and support the idea together to drum up the support of their followers and friends in Washington. I also thought a open letter to be written as a community and sent to all major news outlets (kind of like a viral marketing campaign) and celebrities and government officials about the direction we'd like to see society as a whole move. In addition to these ideas would have to organize protests or mass meetings in our State and National capitals to show that not only do we know what we want but we're willing to make it happen if our representatives are not. I also think just to build a foundation we should *all* start refusing to show ID or answer* questions at DHS checkpoints as well as opt out of TSA scanners and film the pat downs. No one has to be rude or anything to the people performing these tasks (DHS/TSA agents) but I think it would show great solidarity were we to collectively say NO to something we absolutely have the right to say no to. 

&gt;The post I made is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fxmwo/if_there_was_ever_a_time_to_come_together_and_get/) should anyone want to read it.

&gt;EDIT: I also forgot to mention that once we get the ball rolling WE should start running for office together under a banner of not one party but one ideal and the ideal is simply integrity. We need people who will not be bought and any time a lobbyist comes to their office they record/live stream the meeting. I truly believe that this would work. We just need to do it.

&gt;EDIT 2: Also, I thought a great form of protest would be if we all showed up outside our government buildings with every camera we had and just pointed them at the buildings without saying a word. I think that might send a pretty powerful message.


I have made other posts concerning the same ideas in the past but none of them have gotten much traction. So I'm not sure if they were lost in the shuffle of /r/new, if I'm uninspiring, or if they are simply bad ideas.

2. We need to have phone call drives and email list, door-to-door, etc.  This will not happen without a management structure. We need a consistent offline presence not limited to July 4th protests. 

3. We need a website that isn’t reddit. Sorry reddit :(

I have been involved in the planning process from the very beginning, and as the weeks progressed I have increasingly disagreed with the increasingly misguided direction of the movement and its apparent stagnation due to preoccupation with internal bureaucracy at the expense of timely iterative strategy mobilization.

Earlier in the week, I learned that there were about 30 or more people who showed up for position voting and only 5 who showed up to discuss a much-needed viral media blitz campaign before congressional recess started.  Despite all the people involved claiming to do work, there hasn't been a breakthrough in public awareness of the movement, much less any sort of attributable concrete effect, and the NSA spying issue has slipped into public oblivion thus becoming a non-issue as was feared by Snowden.  Nobody knows about RT4.  It's fringe.  Doing work is pointless if it obviously doesn't work.

To me, the egregious lack of effectiveness demonstrated by ""national"" RT4 organizers says that the people who've taken it upon themselves to shamelessly self-promote for a ""leadership"" position lack the perspective necessary to further the cause, most notably demonstrated by the absurd amount of time wasted to determine a cumbersome bureaucracy as time was running out to harness the public's attention.  For whatever reason, certain people who called themselves leaders were unable to comprehend or acknowledge the fact that creating a self-determining bureaucracy is exactly along the lines of current abusive government structures and that implementing such a system alienated massive amounts of people and talent.... leaving a pool of bad ideas, illogical discourse, and lack of actionable intent.  The fact is that the RT4 movement was sabotaged by the infiltration of people who were not self-aware enough to realize that they lacked the insight, discipline, and humility to handle such a project without massively ego-tripping and losing sight of the goal.

Thus, I am no longer willing to extend the usage of the winglock logo to the Restore the Fourth movement.  Effective immediately, the brand assets I created may no longer be retained or used in any sort of web or print media, for commercial or non-commercial purposes alike, with the exception of those who have explicitly asked permission to do so.  Whoever is now in charge of social media should take it upon themselves to ensure that the relevant material is removed from the RT4 online presence.

It sounds like we don't even try to understand why people don't like us, there is no room for negotiation. Instead we just send a cruise missile at the enemy from a drone hoping we can exterminate them all and the pests will go away. Clearly that has not been working, it probably just has been building more resentment by a different group of people, culture and religion we fail to recognize and understand. Terrorism in general can never be defeated either. It is the perfect never ending war against the unknown or the possible. 




Definition of 'Terrorist': ""A person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims""....Could Hayden or Clapper etc be considered a terrorist? They are using fear or terror to keep their political aims of power and control locked in place. They are going against our constitution, blatantly lying to us after swearing to their oath and mongering fear to keep their unnecessary and overreaching programs functioning stronger each day. Terrorism is a double edged sword. So the U.S. government should stop using it and refer to our enemies as people with different ideologies than ours or they themselves should be labeled as terrorists. Terrorists to the American people who they clearly see as a possible enemy. If they weren't they wouldn't need to spy on us. 



TL;DR
By definition some of our government officials and the overreach of the NSA can be labeled 'terrorists' or 'terrorism' to the American People and the world.

Thank you for contacting me about cybersecurity legislation.  I appreciate your concern on this important issue.

 

Our national security and economy continue to face increasing cyber threats from hackers, cyber criminals, and nation states.  As these threats grow in quantity and sophistication, we must find innovative solutions to counter and defend against them.  As a nation, however, we must balance the need to enhance cybersecurity with the need to respect individual privacy and our economic freedom. 

 

Any cyber legislation that Congress considers must achieve this balance between security and economic and personal freedom.  Unfortunately, some of the bills that are being considered do not accomplish this goal, including H.R.624, the ""Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA),"" which passed the House of Representatives and has been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) for further consideration.  As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have thoroughly reviewed this legislation, and I do not believe it would immediately improve the cybersecurity of both the government and the private sector without also increasing the risk of frivolous lawsuits and creating unnecessary restrictions in how or what information may be voluntarily shared by the private sector. 

 

While I remain concerned that the President's Executive order, ""Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,"" signed on February 12, 2013, could result in more burdensome regulations that could further damage our economy and limit the private sector's innovation in responding to cyber threats, I am encouraged by the Executive order's emphasis on better sharing by the government of cyber threat information.  I will continue to monitor the implementation of the Executive order to ensure that it remains voluntary and collaborative and does not infringe upon the rights of our American businesses. 

 

I am deeply committed to working with my colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to enact meaningful legislation that not only enhances the protection of our critical infrastructure, but also preserves individual privacy and economic freedom.  As the Senate considers future cybersecurity legislation, I will keep your comments in mind.

I am a 25 year old college grad who is currently working two jobs to get by. I'm a lot more than just that, but let's start there. I have an idea that I've come across in my readings and have used it first hand that I think will turn the idea of a 'protest' in it's current form on it's head and I'd like to share it with everyone. Thank you for taking the time to read it. I apologize in advance if it seems short or some ideas truncated. I wanted to use this as an introduction, and while I have more information and can elaborate I would love for it to become a collaborative effort on here from this point out. 

Here she is:

There has been an unfortunate half-truth circulating around the world for the past decade: technology can solve the world’s problems. This is a partial statement, missing the most important part: who the people using the technology are.

Technology like wireless heart monitors - featured in a recently newsworthy telephone company’s commercial - can help tell a doctor miles away the condition of an injured skier. This is an example of technology helping to solve a problem, but it is still up to the people hooking up the monitor and the doctor acting correctly; reading the incoming charts and establishing a prognosis is ultimately what makes the event a successful one. Maybe one-day doctor robots with will be able to hover up a mountain and save your life, but right now they just [stick to serving you beer](http://news.discovery.com/tech/beer-drones-deliver-brew-to-concert-goers-130506.htm). Technology will not save that skier, people will. 

We live in a transitional time. There is a symbiotic relationship between man and machines now like never before. Because this world is new there is no existing roadmap to follow and find out how to best sustain this bond to benefit the greater good. 

This summer could be the biggest step down that road. The scheduled ‘Restore the Fourth’ protests in the United States on July 4th of this year have the potential to incite riots, suppressed press coverage – then hyped-up press coverage, misinformation, confusion, and ultimately do nothing but get a lot of people hurt. The negative echoes of ‘Occupy’ are still tumbling around in the cultural subconscious (and in the very real, very new videos from Europe, South America, the Middle East, and China as fellow peaceful protestors are being shot and even killed at this very moment). Clearly, the current model of sign waving and marching has become an easy target. It’s time for a change, time to avoid making the same mistakes again, stranding us by accomplishing nothing.

The biggest problem with ‘Occupy’ was that it was a more than month long campaign to “raise awareness”.  Raising awareness can be done with a single act, like the nude performance in New York of ""Ocularpation: Wall Street"". There, now the world is aware. The camera’s are on (if not the news, than the Smartphone’s and from there, the internet). Now comes the hard part, presenting solutions to the problems we’re all now aware of. 

This is where the ‘Occupy’ movements failed, but only because the largely young population of the movement were standing on the edge of social revolution – the first one of this size in a first world country during the technology age – and didn’t know what to do. Call it prideful ignorance, or fear of not being taken seriously but not one protestor interviewed admitted to not knowing what to do next. People were certainly “mad as hell, and not gonna take it anymore” but that’s not how you enact change, that’s how you attract the riot police – and that’s exactly what happened. This promoted more rage at being hurt, now physically, by the government they were so jaded with, and this vicious cycle spun out of control. 
A call to all the young people (both in age and heart) who care about the future of the world: when you return to the streets, this time have this in mind: You must stop looking for answers from your government and, instead, start presenting your government with answers. 

While this could be done over message boards and social media, getting together, like in a giant classroom, will provide more electricity and excitement than typing alone at your computer will. The Ancient Agora of Athens should be renewed as the Present Agora’s of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and more. The rebirth of our democracy is the only thing on the itinerary. There will be no more detours, or pit-stop’s. It’s forward, to change. But unlike people who promised the same vague destination before, I actually have a plan:

Instead of being bent on destruction focus more on creation. In each city willing to participate the first week of this pop-up convention should spent meeting and greeting everyone, and finding out why they’re there and what they want to change. This will be the hardest part, as you’re going to encounter a lot of people your age, who look like you, but believe in a radically different way of existing.  How wonderful and surprising that we all get to share this planet together. In the interest of actually getting something done, avoid petty debates and move towards like-minded people. Once some groups start to form, within those groups first, make up an awesome group name (The Bull-Moose Party has a nice ring to it) and then use the social mapping and problem solving techniques perfected by environmental workers. They have been used for everything from figuring out how to save endangered species, to where the most sustainable place to build a bridge will be. These techniques (outlined in [Tim W. Clark’s The Policy Process: A Practical Guide for Natural Resources Professionals](http://books.google.com/books?id=7wcQS5vp3lcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=tim+clark+social+mapping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RDmEDX2X6_&amp;sig=jl9fkz6kcI7M3HQCVnmSScV2NNI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Us2_UcmaD5Sh4AOovIGIDw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20clark%20social%20mapping&amp;f=false)) can be used to solve any problem, no matter what discipline, or how big or small. The map is a universal input system fitting any problem and the book outlines how to weigh the problems and solutions presented for best fit while maximizing functionality and maintaining the goals set out by the group. These meetings may happen at night, and may be accompanied by some wine and beers, and interrupted by hilarious personal anecdotes – in other word’s, they may be fun! That’s all part of the experience. If you think the Founding Fathers actually wrote the Constitution in the Philadelphia State House and not originally on napkins in the back of the surround bars then you didn’t ask enough questions in history class as a kid - and you’ve probably never been drunk enough to think you could save the world either. It’s never too late to start questioning and imbibing, just leave the frilled shirts and tricornered hats at home. 

People who have graduated college in the past ten years are part of the most over educated generation ever – this exercise will be very natural for all of you, so don’t be surprised if your mind likes returning to the pattern of open discussion and you find yourself filled with the jolt of hope you maybe last felt sitting in an advanced policy class in college, excited to use your critical mind to change the world one day. Today is that day, pop some ibuprofen and welcome it in.

Next, after a few days of debating within the various groups of likeminded individuals, you select one or two people to present your ideas to everyone. Company’s that young people have invested in, it’s time to invest back in us – because you will not just be speaking to the members of the Restore movement in your own city, but in every city across the country. Big blue box store, donate some loud speakers, a PA, a podium, and a projector screen. Smaller mobile company’s: seize the moment and create free hot stop network. Streaming sites, host this bad boy, and don’t forget the cameras. A timetable can be set up on a social media site -like reddit - where each city will have either a few hours, or maybe even a whole night over the next week to present the ideas of the new collaborators around the world.

Chances are there are people in each city who will think the same and maybe get up and say similar things that have already been said before in other cities. Great! Again, have those likeminded thinkers meet on social media sites and collaborate there, then talk to your pre-law friends, or poli-sci friends, or use the internet to figure out how a bill becomes law and start drawing them up.  But don’t stop their, maybe you idea fits better with NGO’s, or established businesses, non-profits that may have leverage, and even state or government grants – if our elected officials aren’t going to help us fix the world they can at least pay us to do it! The next few days should be spent on cross-city collaborations through the internet, and then a new array of speeches should be given, again using social media to outline timetables. This should be the presentation of the concrete solutions to the problems each group has decided to tackle. At this point some mergers between groups could occur, or one group’s stance on a specific issue – like deregulation of the banking system or free energy – may be considered the ultimate goal across all thinkers in that specific city.  In the interest of time these redundancies should try to be politely recognized and have only one person speak to them. 

The goal of “Restore the Fourth” is to come away with concrete ideas for solving the problems facing us today. We have all done similar exercises in the classroom multiple times in our educational careers – now the simulation is real, but no less achievable.  After that you take the new proposed bills, petitions, business ideas, plans, viral campaign’s and whatever else that’s been created to the appropriate place and people who can take them to their respective next step, pack up your tents, clean up your trash, and head out. 

This is as far as I’m willing to predict. Follow-ups will obviously have to happen on all accounts, but where these ideas go I cannot begin to guess, though if I did venture a guess it would be an optimistic one.

I look forward to contributing to the first national conversation on the future of our civilization; with good people and good technology we can have a better life for everyone on the planet. We just need to slow down and start talking about ‘how’ instead of yelling about ‘why!?’

There has, rightly, been a lot of advice on reddit about the political actions individuals can take over the NSA issue.

But shouldn't we also be talking about what we can all do as consumers?  Specifically, there are strong arguments for voting with our wallets and by withdrawing our personal data from services attached to PRISM.

You could argue that it would be wrong to punish companies merely for complying with the law.  However, that ignores the influence corporates have over the democratic process in America.  I think we should make it clear that complying with unjust laws, without doing anything to protest them, has a cost.

The PRISM list is as follows (in order of how join date):
Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Faceook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple.

One relatively pain-free switch to get started with would be to dump Chrome for Firefox.  Mozilla is a strong supporter of the Stopwatching.us petition (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/86-civil-liberties-groups-and-internet-companies-demand-end-nsa-spying).

Would be great if others could suggest the best alternatives for the other services the PRISM companies provide.

Today is my last day working at a national level with Restore the Fourth. After a long exhausting month, I believe I have spent enough time to understand the trajectory of the movement's people and identity at a national level. I am very proud of all the we have collectively accomplished, and I do hope the change we have worked so hard for comes without trouble in the coming weeks.

While I do not see eye to eye with several of the national organizers, I wish them the best and hope that their motives stay pure and focused on the people impacted by this unconstitutional spying. I urge everyone to step back for a moment and question themselves on that very subject, and not let fame and personal agendas overshadow our original objective.

As for me, I will without a doubt be taking a stand with everyone attending in Dallas at 9AM tomorrow against this unconstitutional surveillance. My objective, and intentions with this movement remain unchanged from the original and I will certainly continue to do my part to see those objectives accomplished.

I will be working with several individuals I met through this movement in the coming weeks to implement a permanent solution. A solution to ensure the people of the world will always have a voice on issues they are passionate about. Restore the Fourth has definitely opened my eyes that people do indeed care, and will continue to seek avenues to show they care; I want to help facilitate those avenues.
  
I cannot thank you all enough for your individual contributions, hard work, and dedication to this movement. If we continue to stand for what we believe is right, we will be amazed at what we collectively can accomplish. Good luck tomorrow everyone, be loud, and be proud.
 
Respectfully,

I'm contacting you as your constituent to urge you to form a committee to fully and publicly investigate the recent revelations published by the Guardian and Washington Post confirming the NSA's secret surveillance programs, and to introduce legislation to stop it. It is wrong, it is illegal - unless it complies with secretive unjust laws - and strikes at the very core of the American ideals of privacy and freedom. You are supposed to uphold the Constitution and represent the interests of the American people. 

Meta-data should not be collected, and actual data and content should not be stored. The recipe for abuse far outweighs the potential benefits. According to Time Magazine, the chances of dying in a terrorist attack in the US from 2007-2011 is 1 in 20 million! But, 1 of every 266 police offers are accused of violent crimes in the US, one-third of which are convicted - and they're accused! Do the math and protect my rights. Using terrorism as an excuse at every corner for every invasion of privacy and trample on freedom is an example of a propaganda point to which I no longer subscribe. What role do secret courts have in a democracy?

It’s past time for us to stand up and defend what is rightfully ours.

We call on a broad range of justice and freedom organizers, organizations and coalitions to come together to fight an out of control government that kills, imprisons and spies as if we are the enemy. We are the people.

The government tells us to be afraid. It spies and harasses and imprisons. It murders and tortures.

But we won’t be afraid. We know that our rights are like muscles, and if we do not flex them, we will lose them.

Whether your major concern is the climate or the wars, abortion rights or gun rights, know this: You will fail to achieve your aims if the government carries on entrenching this militarized police state, a surveillance state more capable and powerful than anything the East German Stasi ever could have dreamed of.

Courage is contagious. We must be brave now.

Join us on July 4, 2013. Bring your crew. If your work concerns the climate, bring your banners and puppets to educate the city about climate change. If you are outraged about the drone bombings, bring fliers talking about those injustices. We will have banners and signs voicing opposition to the police state and the surveillance regime.

Together we are powerful. Together we can win.

Please join us in spreading the word about the Fourth. Do it however you want. We aren’t your bosses; we aren’t in charge.

Let's have a discussion about what we want to see from this movement in the short term and in the long term, what people can start doing right now as members and friends of this community and larger ways we can collaborate into the future. We need a common message of what we stand for so we don't just sound like a bunch of pissed off neck beards as we spread the word and inevitably have to defend ourselves.

This thing's not gonna do itself. Just because we were briefly mentioned in the Guardian and we planned a protest doesn't mean we have this on lock. Let's craft a functional, united front before we get too far ahead of ourselves. There's a lot to do before July 4th.

We need people to step up. Then, we need to know who's stepping up and what they're doing so we can collaborate instead of getting 10 different versions of the same thing.

The most important action item, as mentioned by /u/hachahacha, is a centralized location to aggregate information and attract new minds. Who can do this and can follow through?

1370841593.0,17,self.restorethefourth,1g114l,Some basic guidelines for those who have never protested before.,20,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g114l/some_basic_guidelines_for_those_who_have_never/,"This is copy/pasted from a 4chan thread (yeah, yeah). They're organizing their own protests over there, and I think it's good advice to follow, especially for how to prevent a peaceful protest from becoming violent, keeping on topic, and surviving and salvaging the protest from a bad situation.

Obviously, not all of this applies to us, but it's a good read, regardless, especially for those who may have never protested before (and there will be quite a few of us who haven't).

**How to prepare for a protest** 

**(Weeks before)**

-LEADERS: Contact city council in order to make sure that you are ABLE to protest, and if they have a spot for you to do so. Each city varies in its laws.

-Schedule ahead of time. Tell your boss whats happening, and plan a month in advance.

-Prepare for a 72 hour incarceration, just in case shit hits the fan.

-CONTACT OTHERS AND INSURE YOU ARE PREPARED AND COMMITTED (Most vital info)

-Buy and create protestor/anti-riot kits (see below) to be prepared for shitstorm.

-Print off any pamphlets and signs for yourself, as well as your mates.

-Get in contact with those who are going to the protest. Remember: This isn't a fucking /b/ protest. Staying anonymous may not be an option, depending on how well we want this shit to work.

-If its a 24 hour protest, be prepared to stay longer. Hotel room, clothes, necessities.


**Week of protest**

-Make sure you are not coming to a protest with any warrants (common sense).

-Leave all weapons at home or in your car. Lock your fucking doors.

-Once again, keep in contact with Protest Leader(s) to maintain communication and affirmation of joining as well as self-confidence.

-Plan your hotel lodgings. Do it on a day by day basis in case of incarceration.

-No fucking hippy clothes, bring whats appropriate for the weather and make sure it looks good. Shower and shave out of courtesy for your fellow protestors.


**Day of protest**

-Dress politely.

-Contact leaders.

-Distribute pamphlets.

-Receive item of identification from leaders in order to prevent police infiltration of peaceful protest (CRITICAL). Armbands preferred.

-Bring anti-riot kits, keep them near you at all times. Or keep them on/in your belts/purses/backpacks.

-Remember the cause. Remind people of the cause. Keep on the same page, and appoint a speaker for the protest. If you are not the speaker, simply say 'No comments', or refer them to the appointed speaker. (Prevents media clash)

-SPEAKERS: Know what to say, how to say it, and be prepared to deliver responses. Keep in control of your emotions, and DON'T GIVE THE MEDIA ANYTHING THEY CAN USE AGAINST YOU.


**Anti-riot Kits** (DO NOT USE DURING PROTEST, USE ONLY IF SHIT HITS THE FAN. WEARING THIS AND HAVING IT OUT IN THE OPEN GIVES THE MEDIA FUEL.)

-Antacid spraybottle formula to nullify mace and pepper spray.

-Baklava mask

-Eye-covering lenses or goggles. If you wear glasses, get some construction safety goggles.

-Bandana that can be quickly soaked in water (to place over mouth/nose to nullify mace). You may need to practice breathing while wearing one of these.

**Anti-riot Control tactics**

AMAZING LINK, DEFINITELY A MUST READ: http://info.publicintelligence.net/LAJRIC-DefeatCrowdControl.pdf

Congratulations! Your once peaceful protest has completely and utterly escalated into an all-out shitstorm!

How can you recover?

-Reaffirm with your colleagues and fellow protestors.

-Discourage IMMEDIATELY any and all looting.

-Gather into numbers and try to remain calm.

-Stand strong, refer to above link and react appropriately.

-YOU MAY NEED TO BECOME A LEADER. GROW A PAIR AND BE ONE.

-Herd cats and continue to remain peaceful.

-KEEP AN EYE FOR POLICE INFILTRATORS. KNOW YOUR FELLOW PROTESTORS FACES. KEEP YOUR IDENTIFICATION ITEMS ON AT ALL TIMES. REPORT TO LEADERS IMMEDIATELY IF ITEM IS MISSING/STOLEN. SHUN ANY AND ALL WHO ACT VIOLENTLY TO RIOT-CONTROL.

-If its a matter of life and death, respond appropriately.

This may occur when members of the jury disagree with the law the defendant has been charged with, or believe that the law should not be applied in that particular case."" (Wikipedia) The power of jury nullification in the United States, derived from the power vested in British juries of the same name, was established early on in the country's history (*cf.* Zenger Trial, 1735). John Jay, the first chief justice of the Supreme Court, instructed a jury that ""You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge [both the facts and law].""
 
With Holder's open letter promising to treat Snowden in a civilian court and without torture (sad that has to be said), it seems to me that this would be the perfect case for nullification. The problem is, that while juries definitely have the power of nullification, the *right* of juries to nullify is a much more contentious issue. Since 1895 (United States v Sparf) the courts have ruled that informing jurors of their power to do so is not required of judges, and in the vast majority of cases they have acted to actively suppress its practice by informing juries that their only job is to judge according to the instruction of the law, and not the law itself ([source](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html)).

The point of this long exposition is to ask: if Snowden acquiesces to extradition, or is otherwise made to stand trial in the U.S., would it not be possible to start a campaign to acquit on the basis of nullification? If a jury is presented with the facts and instructed to solely judge whether or not he violated the law, he will be found guilty. If, however, there is a campaign to educate the public on this power with regard to this case beforehand, it might provide a legal remedy to his lawful but unjust prosecution.

Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, or even remotely close. I'd be interested to hear what people with more familiarity with this kind of thing have to say, especially with regard to the measures that courts can legally take to suppress the dissemination of this tactic.

How about doing something extremely easy, like advocating for a perjury prosecution against James Clapper.  It's a slam dunk case, and if anything ultimately meaningful is to come out of these revelations, those guilty must be prosecuted -- otherwise, what will prevent future abuse?  If however, the easiest criminal prosecution in the history of the universe is ignored, it merely confirms the existence of a two tier justice system and that no meaningful consequences flow when those in power break the law -- and not just any law, but the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.  I don't think the prosecutions should stop at Clapper by any means, but he represents not just low hanging fruit, obviously lying (on the ground) fruit, and it would be a start.  But if that never happens, it means nobody else will face consequences, and all that you wrote below is just comforting pap to placate the people, and set them up for the next stage of illegal behavior by the Executive branch.  

Will you be the first to call for criminal prosecution?  Or will you wait until the legislative and judicial branches are rendered quaint, but irrelevant bodies?

Dear Mr. [lastName],

Thank you for contacting me regarding the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. I appreciate hearing from you on this matter.

On June 8, 2013, the press exposed, and the Obama Administration acknowledged, that the National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting data associated with millions of American citizens' phone records, including phone numbers, locations, and duration of calls. Additionally, reports revealed the existence of the NSA's ""PRISM,"" a government computer system used to facilitate the collection of foreign intelligence information from U.S.-based electronic communications service providers.

I find these reports deeply troubling. On June 12, 2013, I signed onto a letter sent to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency created by Congress, charged with conducting oversight of the Executive branch to ensure its actions balance the need to protect our nation's security, while preserving individual privacy and civil liberties. The letter requests that the Board determine whether the NSA's actions were conducted within the authority granted by Congress and that the necessary precautions to protect the privacy and civil liberties of American citizens under the U.S. Constitution were taken. Additionally, I am looking very closely at legislation that has recently been introduced to address concerns as a result of this data collection. 

In 2008, I opposed the Protection of America Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-55) and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-261) for, among other things, concerns over civil liberties protections. On December 28, 2012, I voted against final passage of the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-238). I had significant concerns that this bill did not adequately protect the constitutional rights of American citizens. Furthermore, the bill gives federal agencies authority to continue warrantless wiretapping programs, which allows for eavesdropping on communications and review of emails without an open warrant process. Despite my objections, the FISA Amendments Act was passed by the Senate by a vote of 73 to 23, and was signed into law by President Obama on December 30, 2012. 

As you may know, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 was enacted after a series of U.S. Senate hearings revealed Central Intelligence Agency abuses throughout the 1970s. This law sets requirements for physical and electronic surveillance and provides for judicial oversight for most federal wiretapping conducted in the United States.

I believe we must take necessary actions to defeat terrorists both overseas as well as here in the United States. We must also stop those here in the U.S. who are helping terrorists overseas, but we should do so in a way that is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and that protects the privacy of law-abiding Americans.

I believe we can protect both our national security and our civil liberties. To do that there must be oversight of government and anti-terrorism programs to ensure that civil liberties are indeed protected.


Sincerely,  
Maria Cantwell 
United States Senator

1374079499.0,19,self.restorethefourth,1ihu9t,Since we are sharing Congress responses - Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown,19,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1ihu9t/since_we_are_sharing_congress_responses_ohio/,"Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding the recent revelations of data sharing between Verizon and the National Security Agency (NSA).
 
According to documents released in the press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sought permission to collect data on cell phone use of Verizon customers as part of a classified program aimed at preventing acts of terror in the United States. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which oversees requests for classified electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering, approved at least one request that Verizon provide the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) with select call log data for Verizon customers. The FBI claims the data collected and shared includes routing information such as originating and receiving phone numbers, individual mobile subscriber numbers, calling card numbers, and the time and duration of each call. It does not include content of the call, or the personal location or identification information of customers.
 
The FISC was created in 1978, and is composed of 11 federal judges. Its authority to grant access to business records was established under the USA PATRIOT Act and was extended in 2008 and 2012.
 
Thank you also for sharing your concerns regarding the National Security Agency’s (NSA) data collection program “PRISM.”
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) recently confirmed reports that the NSA has used a classified computer system known as PRISM to collect foreign intelligence information. The system contains communications of foreign citizens located abroad that have been collected by internet service providers and delivered to the NSA for analysis. The DNI also released a public fact sheet about the program. It is available at: http://1.usa.gov/1bhNPkX.
 
PRISM’s information gathering falls under procedures that were passed in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) and extended by the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012. While the internet service providers subject to information requests have not been confirmed, the DNI stated that all information was provided after the law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ requests were approved by the FISC.
 
I fully support efforts to protect our nation, but such efforts must not compromise the very foundation that makes our country great; our civil liberties and Constitutional rights. Many questions, including the breadth of the information gathering, the extent of information about U.S. citizens that was gathered, and the length of time that the information was kept on file, must be addressed.
 
It's critical that we find a balance between security and freedom. Protecting our national security is critically important, and we still need to learn more, but any sort of overbroad surveillance is cause for serious concern. I voted against the Patriot Act in 2001, the FISA amendments in 2008, and the extension of Patriot Act provisions in 2011. I will continue to support measures that protect our nation from terrorism while also reforming the most dangerous parts of this law to protect our civil liberties and constitutional rights.
 
I will continue to closely monitor this situation as additional details about both incidents come to light. Should any legislation related to intelligence gathering and our civil liberties come before the Senate, I will keep your views in mind. Thank you again for getting in touch with me.
 
                         Sincerely,

(I don't think it's in my best interests to reveal more information than that.) It was about the annual IMF meeting in Washington and why there had been protests in other places, but not there. I found his discussion pretty appalling, so I quote exactly:

""Smart cops! About five years ago they decided to outwit the protesters. They very cleverly set in motion tactics that effectively unhinged the leadership of the protests.

One of my favorite tactics was this: Two nights before the target date, The Police would swoop in on the organizing headquarters of the protest movement and arrest everyone for code violations in the building. They wouldn't detain people, but they confiscated all the computers and papers and everything else that was being used in preparation and held it as 'evidence' of the code violation. Suddenly the organizers were without communication capabilities or a place to meet. They fell into chaos and disorder.

The bulk of the foot soldiers in these civil disobediences are energetic kids looking for a little recreation with a theoretic purpose. The organizers are the key. They are the ones the cops decided to focus on with tactics designed to undermine their authority and communication ability.

It worked. Washington has been relatively quiet in recent years on IMF weekend. You can tell it is a special weekend because there are all these lean 28 year-old men in slim Italian suits standing outside waiting limousines with cell phones in hand, trying to look important while their bosses are inside making deals or gathering intelligence. There is no tension in the air.

I credit it to smart policing. Good cops. We need them.""

Even aside from the fact that I think I have a very different idea about what makes a good cop and good policing, the sheer arrogance and self-congratulatory glee over squashing dissent made (and still makes) my blood boil. There has to be another way to practice civil disobedience that they can't ignore, disrupt, or marginalize but I don't know what it is.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,1370966917.0,,,True,t3_1g4h1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g4h1v/memo_on_washington_police_tactics_to_disrupt/,

The reason I filed this, is that even though my city is smallish (80k), I have twice seen a local police car with trunk mounted license plate scanning equipment.

Now, I don't really have a problem with license plate scanning if the data is immediately discarded if the license plate doesn't belong to a stolen car or there are no warrants for the owner's arrest -- what would bother me is building a database of historical location information when the license plate turns up nothing of note.

Before I start, please excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes.


If you don't already know me, my name is Andrea O'Neill a/k/a scarletsaint. I have been working for RTF in the capacity of DC Local Organizer Since Day 1, and as a National Organizer since 6/22/2013. Currently, I am acting as the interim National Director. Anna aka veryoriginal078, is taking a brief hiatus due to stress and personal issues. We had a discussion where I suggested I take her place, and I then spoke with the other national organizers to confirm that this was okay. I received a yes from 3 (Anna, Yusiye, and Bipolarbear0, and was not able to reach 1.) This resulted in a 4/5 in favor of me briefly substituting for Anna in this position. I would like to make the best out of this situation while I am here.

Let me provide my credentials. I am 32 years old and I work as a DOD contractor. I have done so since 2004 in several different countries including Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Germany, Djibouti, Tanzania and Italy. I have worked in the IT Industry since 1998. I am currently working as a Cyber Operations Security Analyst for a Federal Contracting Agency (NOT the NSA.) I have a clearance and I am familiar with security protocols associated with the subject matter we are working with in this movement. I have worked as a network security analyst help desk admin, systems administrator, and help desk lead/supervisor in the past.
I am currently attending school to obtain a degree in Computer Information Systems/Network Security.

I began a group for ecospiritualists in Colorado Springs in 2007 and ran it for approximately 5 years. The group had around 500 people at any given time with a lifetime membership between 1500-2000. Shortly before the group broke apart due my absence (I had to move) the group was working on 501c3 status. During the time I was there, I worked with the media, managed the financials, hosted the events, and other similar duties to what I have done here for RTF

We (local and national organizers) are voting on the long-term members of the board on Tuesday, so this ""appointment"" will just be for a short time, but I wanted to take a few minutes and discuss some recent developments with you. I posted a daily agenda in DC every day leading up to 7/4, and it proved to be very useful during that process. Since we have many important issues to tackle this week, I thought it would be helpful to begin using them again, for a short period of time. I will try to break them down into categories, if possible.

**Long-Term Volunteer/Intern Positions**

As you know, RTF is currently working on receiving its nonprofit status. We have a large workload of tasks that need to be handled to get this fledgling organization off the ground, and in order to do that, we need help from volunteers. Currently, we have several positions open. Here is a list of some. Please understand that for the time being, these will be volunteer positions. This may or may not change in the future. Either way, it's great to have on your resume and you're getting in on the ground floor. 
Here is a list of some of the positions needed. For an explanation of what is required, please contact us. For now, you can contact organizing@restorethefourth.net or restorethe4thdc@gmail.com if interested.

Only QUALIFIED candidates will be considered.

* Lead Graphic Designer 
* Graphic Designer 
* Human Resource 
* PR Directors (Work as a PR team) 
* Social Media Directors (Work as a Social Media team) 
* Marketing Director 
* Fundraising Director 
* Senior Copy Writer 
* Copy Writers (2-3) 
* Local &amp; National Coordinator (Responds to local requests) 
* Accountant 
* Legal Counsels 


**Local Organizers**

We need the input of established local organizers in our Tuesday meeting this week, and following meetings. Please email restorethe4thdc@gmail.com for information on the Tuesday meeting. 

We need long-term local organizers in several locations. If you are interested in being a local organizer, please contact us ASAP and we will help get you started. For now, please contact organizing@restorethefourth.net or restorethe4thdc@gmail.com, and we will help you, or point you in the right direction.

Local Orgs- We would like to help you gain supporters and help you build coalitions with other local organizations! Please let us know if you need assistance.


**1984 Day**

1984 day is Sunday, 8/4/2013. We need to get some feedback from local organizers about what is going on in their area so we can add it to our calendar. Please get back to us ASAP. Please email restorethe4thdc@gmail.com


Quick Edit: Anna will be back following her vacation.

I would like to tackle as many of these issues today as possible. I would also love to hear your input here, if possible. Please contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thank You
Andrea O'Neill

* Bring something: From barbecue, a football, to a simple sign... something to allow families to participate. Do not underestimate the power of a barbecue in the U.S. This will make it comfortable for newcomers and is important to prevent the media from portraying us as different.

It's a start.  But a meager one at that.

Some of the movement pictures and video I was seeing was downright sad.  In previous years I had engineered spontaneous protests with my classmates which had better turn-outs.

Here's what needs to be done:

* **GET A CENTRALIZED SPOKESPERSON AND LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE.**  Now I know other countries don't have this, but where we fall short is that in places like Brazil, Turkey, etc they have legit opposition parties lumping themselves together.  This movement AFAIK has no backing from opposition parties.  Having no central leader only works if you have actual working/efficient subgroups.

* **BLOCK COMMERCE.**  Don't march down random streets on a holiday.  March down the highway.  March down the freeway.  Guaranteed the news will cover it and you'll slow down commerce.  It's aggressive yet peaceful.
* **MARCH ON CAPITOL BUILDINGS + HOMELAND SECURITY BUILDINGS + ANY GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.**  This point is moot when you choose a huge national holiday when everyone has the day off.  But during a normal week this can be effective.
* **GET ACTUAL SPEAKERS, SOLICIT BIG NAMES OR IMPORTANT PEOPLE.** My local movement took volunteers for speaking, needless to say it was a real treat.
* **BRING PICKET SUPPLIES.**  Bring markers and poster-board to your marches or whatever.  It's cheap and passerby can get involved.
* **DONT MAKE COMPLEX SIGNS.** If I can't read your sign from a good distance in 7-10 seconds then you're doing it wrong.  Collages of words on Thomas Jefferson's head is fucking stupid and doesn't bring the issue to light.
* **REACH OUT TO INTEREST GROUPS &amp; LOBBIES.**  There are a shit-ton of internet freedom/privacy groups and companies which support the idea.  Reach out to them.  Get some cash from them.  Get some keynote speakers from them.  Build a network with the SOPA opposition groups of days past and others.
* **SHOW EXAMPLES OF HOW DATA IS TAKEN ETC.**  This kinda falls under like protest art but make it clear what data is being taken on fliers or when you talk to people.  It isn't just internet data.

Dear Mr. (flyguy52)

Thank you for contacting me with your concerns about recent reports of actions by the National Security Agency (NSA), including the PRISM program and collecting records from communications companies like Verizon. I appreciate you taking the time to express your thoughts on these issues.

Like you, I have serious concerns about reports that the NSA has been collecting phone records from millions of Americans. Although the records appear to be restricted only to the phone numbers and the length of calls (specifically excluding names and call content), great care needs to be taken where privacy is at stake. I believe greater oversight of the agencies collecting personal data is needed to prevent government overreach.

I assure you I take privacy issues very seriously. Earlier this year, I voted against the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), H.R. 624, because the bill did not include adequate provisions to protect American citizen's personally identifiable information.

Thank you again for contacting me with your concerns. I assure you that I am committed to effectively representing my constituents, and I can only do that when you and your neighbors share your views with me. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future regarding any other issue. For additional information on my work in Congress, please sign up for my e-newsletter at https://esty.house.gov/contact/newsletter.",,False,,t5_2xhsu,False,,,True,t3_1grqws,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1grqws/contacted_my_congresswoman_and_two_senators_with/,
1371587804.0,15,self.restorethefourth,1glx8a,Proposal for Rule Changes and Clarifications,29,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1glx8a/proposal_for_rule_changes_and_clarifications/,"*Reason for rule change*
----

We propose the following changes to our community guidelines in the interest of greater transparency regarding moderation policy. Recent concerns about moderation have made it clear that these policies are neither well understood nor consistently applied. We hope these new rules will help provide the community with greater awareness and structure. In addition to these changes our moderation team is taking steps internally to assure our mods remain professional and will meet our community's standards. We welcome all constructive feedback on these guidelines and we will make revisions with the community's suggestions here in mind.


**Existing rules are as follows**

&gt;1. We do not advocate or support violence or unlawful behavior in any way.  Any posts or comments which fail to meet this standard shall be removed.  Should you encounter them, please report them so that moderators can  remove them.
[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fzmj2/any_posts_or_comments_which_incite_advocate_or/)

&gt;2. No posts (comments are fine. everyone is entitled to their own  personal opinion) which are not directly relevant to this movement. That  means no Anti-Obama, no Anti-Republican, no Anti-Democrat, no  Anti-Libertarian, etc. Nothing that could be seen as polarizing, or that  could create the false impression that this subreddit is politically  leaning in any particular direction. There are plenty of other  subreddits that can be used for that purpose.

&gt;3. Do not make posts which are unnecessary and push down legitimate  posts. This isn't about getting internet points. If there is a post made  about a particular organizer trying to get support, and no one can see  that post because of 100 totally unrelated posts, that does no one any  good. In the coming days, there will be a LOT of posts related to  specific upcoming events in different areas, and it is very important  that everyone is able to see them. 
[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g75ca/restore_the_fourth_announcement_and_proposed/)


**New Rules are as follows**

     These will replace the rules above.

**Your submission will be removed if it:**

* Is Off Topic


This includes but is not limited to distracting jokes, unrelated blogs, articles, or memes.
Submissions should be thoughtful and relevant to the cause or ideals of Restorethe4th. 

**Your comment or submission will be removed if it:**

* Promotes Violence


We are an explicitly *non-violent* movement, so any discussion about violence or vandalism is inherently off topic and is considered an implicit provocation to violence in our rallies. While you're entitled to your opinion about it, this is not the place for it. There are better outlets for those discussions.

* Is Uncivil


Remarks that are bigoted or incendiary are divisive and not welcome.
We try to be inclusive to everyone who supports our cause and do not condone speech that harrasses or belittles others.

* Violates Reddit's 
[Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) or [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

In the interests of maintaining a positive environment we seek to align ourselves with the site-wide guidelines put forth by the greater Reddit community.

**Spammers and repeat offenders will be banned without notice.**


If you come across a post that breaks any of these rules, please help us out by reporting it.

The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independent 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""
