1336060277.0,125,self.Miami,t58cl,"People are always looking for things to do in Miami (besides, you know, the club scene). Here's a list. ",150,25,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/t58cl/people_are_always_looking_for_things_to_do_in/,"I wrote this up [for this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/t4wx5/im_24_and_dont_like_drinking_smoking_of_any_kind/). I'm going to include a list for drinking and eating too, and will edit when I think of more. Please add your own in the comments!

Things to do if you're not a clubber, drinker, or late night partier:

* Go watch Jai Alai and enjoy the rowdy old Cuban men yelling at the players. It's free, though you can gamble if you'd like.

* Bike the 15 mile Shark Valley path, then get fried alligator at a Miccosukee stop along the way (if you're not totally pooped, maybe go air boating too).

* Climb a couple walls at X-Treme Rock Climbing down south. You'll need a buddy for this.

* ~~Go join up with the anime club at FIU. They put on a totally free anime con each year called Yasumicon, and it's loads of fun.~~ Clarketk pointed out that Yasumicon and the FIU Anime Club are no longer a thing. Instead, check out Florida Supercon or Mizucon this summer, and join up with the UM Anime Club for screenings on Thursday nights (thanks, Desertfox88!).

* Go check out El Palacio de los Jugos. It was featured on No Reservations for a reason.

* Take a figure drawing course at UM. It's about five bucks and you get to draw a naked person for hours. Heaps of fun!

* Do yoga in the mornings at Bay Front Park. It's free and will help to alleviate all of the pent up anger you've got about Miami.

* Outland Station ~~up in Ft. Lauderdale~~ in Kendall (thanks for the correction, the_showerhead!) holds D&amp;D and card gaming events all the time. Go join up with a group.

* Asian events happen all the time, like the Asian festival at Fruit &amp; Spice Park, or all the stuff that happens up at the Morakami Gardens (bit of a haul -- worth it!).

* Go check out all the festivals at Fairchild Tropical Gardens. The gardens are one of the cities greatest treasures. My brother works there and I'm sure he'd be thrilled to give you a tour of their acres and acres of amazing plants.

* Speaking of family, go see the Wolfsonian Museum (also called the Museum of Propoganda) over on South Beach. My dad, a stalwart attendee of Reddit meetups, is the Director of Fundraising and loves showing people around. Their collection is totally astounding.

* Go watch a movie at O Cinema in Wynwood. They're always showing weird and obscure films (though sometimes they put on movies that everyone knows, like their Rocky Horror Picture Show screening around Halloween time).

* Join the Wynwood Art Walk for a tour of the Wynwood area. The next one is on Saturday May the 12th, and you're sure to see some mind blowing art.

* Go eat your fill at Food Truck Night. These move all around each day so you're really going to have to just Google it (like the rest of the ideas I'm giving you).

* The Goldcoast Railroad Museum down by the zoo is really worth checking out. It's recently renovated, but even when it wasn't it was a fun trip to go and wander through old trains in the middle of nowhere.

* While you're over there, go to the Zoo. It's become better and better as the years have gone by and it's worth your patronage.

* You say you're not into sports but it's baseball season and most weekends there are three games in a row at UM. Ticket price is $10 if you're not a student, there's plenty of seating and they have some of the best milkshakes in town.

* Speaking of milkshakes, go patronize Norman Bros. over on Galloway. They're a staple of the city and their meat is second to none, but if you're not grocery shopping then their key lime shake is hard to beat.

* If you're into more hardcore fare, you can always go pick a gun of your choosing and shoot it at the shooting gallery in Hialeah. It'll cost you though (both in cash and in hearing loss).

* Go to the beach! You live in Miami! I prefer going up around Collins &amp; 69th, where the beach is still white and the water is still clear, but the parking is much, much easier.

* Tour the city in a whole new way during Critical Mass on the last Friday of every month. Remember to bring your bike.

* Go do a You-Pick-'Em session at one of the many amish Redlands farms. There's also a closer one over on Kendall.

* Meet up with other Redditors at Sandbar (no one says you have to drink) and do a little Trivia on a Friday night.

* Go check out the Hare Krishna temple in Coconut Grove. It's beautiful to see and sometimes they give out good free vegan food.

* Wander through Bal Harbor and pretend you can afford what the shops are offering.

* Even if you don't drink, you could still catch a free brewing class at Brewbox down south. It's a lot of fun and you'll learn a ton! (rhyming!)

* Ride the Metro back and forth. There's good stories in the making from that.

* Get your off road vehicle license from Big Cypress National Park. You'll watch a powerpoint and then get your photo and name on a little card that allows you to ride ATCs, ATVs, Airboats, and Swamp Buggies.

* Once you've done that, rent an ATV and drive it down the trails off of Loop Road. The moon rock (raised limestone) makes for an exciting and bumpy ride.

* Are you into comic books? There's a comic book store on Bird Rd. (probably the only one in the city) that's just totally incredible. Wall to wall boxes of old comic books and new comic books, and a ceiling strung up with related goodies like toys and lunch boxes (I got a ""Fruity Oaty Bar"" Firefly lunchbox from there).

* Got some work to do, or want to read a bit? Then go to the hipster coffee bars in Wynwood, Lester's and Panther Coffee. They'll serve you up a good brew and some empanadas and you can chill out in the art district in style.

* Via iRUVtacos, check out Books and Books in Coral Gables. It's a great break from chain bookstores, and they always have an incredible selection that breaks the mold. You can also sit outside and eat from their really lovely little cafe (that just started serving mini-medianoches!).

* Also from iRUVtacos, Planet Linux Caffe just opened up. Go get your nerd on!

* User juniorv376 is a member of a bi-weekly GO group that is active in both Hialeah and Aventura. Bug him about it! 



For the drinkers:

* Titanic Brewery over by UM can't be overstated as my favorite place to drink in the city. They brew the best IPA I've ever had (perfectly grapefruity) and make a pulled pork sandwich to beat Shorty's.

* Mac's Club Deuce is one of the last remaining true dives on the beach. I hear it's grody -- but isn't that what you want?

* Though if we're talking dives, Fox's is a great old bar and restaurant that's recently undergone renovations. If you catch this place at night you might get lucky and see some live music or be privy to an awesome happy hour with outdoor seating. If you come in the daytime you'll meet the creme de la creme of the old school Miamians, there to get sloshed at noon. Fox's has been around since 1943 and it's gained a loyal following.

* Abraxas on Meridien Ave. is built into someone's bottom floor apartment. You can still smoke inside (watch out!), they'll provide you with board games, and they're the most beer savvy place in the city. Sometimes they do all Dogfish Head taps. Yum!

* The Abbey has been around for years and they also recently renovated. Go get some traditional trappist ale in their gorgeously embiggened space.

* DRB (Democratic Republic of Beer) is a beer snob joint with a classically Miami vibe. They're a little too shiny for my taste, but the food is good and the beer is better (and it ought to be, with over 400 choices from around the world). Ask for a beer passport!

* WetLab is an amazing place and should be considered a treasure of the city. It's a little hard to find since it's hidden in the back of the UM Marine Biology School, but this bar run by the Marine Biology students is incredible. With a nice outside view of the water and three dollar beer on tap (good beer too, none of this Miller Lite crap), this is the perfect place to watch the sunset and relax. Cash only!




Food:

* Por Fin is reopening some time soon (not sure when) and when it does you should go eat their Bunuelos de Bacalao. Perfecto!

* Mojito grill (hole in the wall Cuban joint) in South Miami makes the most perfect croquetas. The rest leaves something to be desired though.

* Versailles has okay food but it's a must for the Miami experience.

* Via Tmachine, ""If you want actual BBQ you will need to head to Shiver's which is in Homestead. It's a trek, but it's the best BBQ I've had in Florida and a contender for best BBQ period. They have a variety of North Carolina style sauces and their sides are out of this world. Pulled Pork with a Vinegar Sauce, Jalapeno Cheese grits and Collards is probably the best meal a human being can have.""

* Also re-mentioning Don Burrito -- it's the only place to get Mexican food.

* The Daily over on Biscayne Blvd is good diner food with a nice outdoor seating area. I like their breakfast burrito in particular.

* Miss Saigon on Dixie Highway makes the best Pho in the entire world. Trust me. Also, if you're a UM student, sometimes the manager gives you free food and flashes the ""U"" at you.

* Lan Pan Asian in Dadeland Station makes the freshest and tastiest sushi, imho.

* Whisk is the city's current baby. Nouveau Americana food to die for, including homemade cornbread and lemonade.

* If you want pizza, it's hard to beat Miami's Best (which tends to live up to its name). Get their pepperoni, it's the best pepperoni you'll ever have, probably.

* There's a little french bakery in a strip mall off of Red Rd. by Sunset Place called something like ""Le Royale,"" and they make killer quiche and crepes (not to mention their tarts and cakes -- holy crap!)

A few places that come to my mind that provide a laid back atmosphere, good drink selection, and I know will cater to our needs are Abraxas Lounge, The Room, or Magnum lounge. If we're feeling stupid loose we can do multiple locations as well. Lets get some input on locations and time.

Details here: http://redditgifts.com/meetups/miami-fl-meet/

**EDIT**: Alright, after plenty of time for everyone to voice suggestions on where to meet up; the consensus is rearing towards a park during the day and some sort of watering hole for all the lushes at night. 

We will be meeting up at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne at 1:00 PM, the only ""catch"" I suppose is the $5 parking. However, for the space, scenery, and freedom to do whatever we want, it is plenty worth it. We live where other redditors elsewhere vacation; let's make them jelly, so jelly. 

During the evening, we will be meeting at Burger and Beer Joint at 7 PM. That's right motherfucker, all the beer, liquor, and burger your alcoholism can handle. Further details in the official meet up link posted above in the original post. 

For all the Socially Awkward Penguins who might be reading this right now, unnerved, ask for Manny.

They are telling the people who work for the library system that they aren't allowed to spread the word. Please, if you've ever used the library, then spread the word! We can't let the county shut down all of our libraries.

There are going to be the following Town Hall meetings for the budget of the next fiscal year. If you can make it, and/or get more people to come and fight for the libraries to stay open, then maybe we can make a change. Let's bring together the power of reddit to stop this injustice!

We are the fastest, the brightest, the best on this side of the issue. Not because we're good, but because no one else is doing anything. As far as anyone in the world knows, Miami doesn't care about what's going on.

**We** need focus the discussion. We need to frame the argument on the news, and we need to do it fast. Did anybody see the news today? They spent all day trying to discredit Snowden instead of telling us what's happening.

This isn't Kony, this isn't a political capaign, this isn't even OWS. This is ***every*** US citizen's Constitutional rights being *thrown away*.

Our parents can't fix it, our politicians won't fix it, *there is no help coming*. **We** are the cavalry and we need to act like it.

1361846030.0,47,self.Miami,198f5u,"Woman DROWNS off the coast of Miami Beach; Coast Guard looks on uselessly/does NOTHING, then LIES about being there",64,17,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/198f5u/woman_drowns_off_the_coast_of_miami_beach_coast/,"(x-post from r/justice) 

Apologies in advance for the length of this rant, but I experienced something yesterday that I thought was so absurdly ridiculous on the part of the US Coast Guard (USCG), that I had to share--perhaps in hopes that I'm completely wrong about what the responsibilities of the USCG are, so that someone will enlighten me, as I currently believe that their incompetence literally took someone's life.

I was on board a diving boat yesterday (Sunday, Feb 24) off the coast of Miami Beach. The boat carries approximately 40 people (including certified divers, students and beginners), not including crew, to a couple of dive sites off Miami's coast. 
At the conclusion of the first dive, which lasted about 45 minutes, the crew did a roll call. At this point, they realize that there is one of the scuba divers--a middle-aged woman, is missing. Her dive buddy (to those unfamiliar with diving--everyone is always assigned a partner, in case something goes wrong) says that she thought she had seen her come aboard, but evidently this wasn't the case. It happens now and then that someone gets separated from their partner--often overwhelmed by a current of something like that. There are several ""backups"" in diving for these types of issues--for instance, dives are planned so that you still have a decent amount of oxygen left in your tank by the time you're supposed to be back on the ship; we have a snorkel, so you can float on the surface and still be able to breath even if there are waves hitting you; the BCD (this is the ""vest"" that the scuba tank is actually attached to) can be inflated just like a life-vest--all so that a person can safely wait to be rescued. 

Once it was confirmed that the woman was missing, everyone on the ship starts scanning the water surface looking for her. About 25 minutes later, someone spots her scuba tank several hundred yards from our boat. We head over and realize that it's only her BCD and scuba tank. At this point, things become more serious--it's very difficult to stay afloat for an extended period of time without the BCD, and easy to succumb to exhaustion. At this point the USCG is called...

One small boat arrives about 15 minutes later. Our captain informs them about what's going on, where exactly we found the tank/BCD, etc. 
He asks one of the USCG how they'd like to continue the search. The USCG officer looks at us with a completely blank stare, glances at one of his fellow officers, then looks back at our captain and shrugs. The rest of the conversation wasn't audible, but we left to continue searching, while the USCG boat kept circling a tiny area. 

We spend the next hour with two of our divers dragging off the back of our boat, scanning the waters beneath us as we drove. Meanwhile, the USCG boat is still circling the same area. No other boats have responded. No helicopters (despite that fact that the water was completely clear and the missing woman was wearing pink--a color that probably would've been visible from the air).
At the end of the hour, one of our divers behind the boat gives a signal to stop. At this point, the USCG boat that was trying to see how many circles they could do heads over. Our diver (a woman, mid-20s, maybe 5' tall, we'll call her Betty) heads underwater and pulls the woman up. Betty starts swimming over to the USCG boat, but they start yelling at her, ""no, don't bring her over here! Take her to your boat!"" Betty, holding up this lady, exhausted from being dragged behind the boat for an hour, is confused and says to them, ""where am I taking her?!"" And they yell back, ""to YOUR boat!"" So Betty starts swimming all the way back from the USCG boat to ours (about 40 feet). The USCG officers watch and do nothing.
People on our boat are yelling at them, that there are lots of kids on board, that we don't have the training they do or medical equipment they do. They say nothing.

We spend the next 35 minutes going full-speed back to port, where EMS is waiting. Betty and 3 other people on our boat took turns performing CPR the entire time. Meanwhile, the same USCG boat, which was at least 5 times faster than our vessel has sped past us about 8 times--they were now circling us, apparently. 

By the time we got to port, the woman was pronounced dead. A 41-year old woman with 2 kids, in Miami on vacation (her kids were not with her).

In the news today, the USCG claims that they arrived after the body was already recovered. THIS IS A BLATANT LIE. See second paragraph: http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/02/24/woman-dies-during-scuba-trip-off-miami-beach/

Now, here are my issues/questions...

- Why did one 1 USCG boat respond? Why no helicopter? Oceans are big--and boats can only cover so much ground. Even our captain thought it was a miracle we found the woman--20 feet in either direction, and our diver likely wouldn't have spotted her.
- Why did the USCG refuse to take her on board? Surely they must be trained in CPR and have better medical equipment than the crew of a dive boat?
- To the point above, their boat was SIGNIFICANTLY faster than ours (and had no kids/tourists!!!) -- if there was even a chance that arriving faster at port could've made a difference, why wouldn't they have done it??
- Why would they lie later about arriving only after the body had been recovered?",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_198f5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/198f5u/woman_drowns_off_the_coast_of_miami_beach_coast/,

Basically, if you go into a shop reeking of pot or talking about it and the seller even suspects that you're going to use it for that purpose, they become legally liable for it and are committing a criminal act.

This is why most smoke shops already had signs up saying that discussion about any substance other than tobacco would be grounds for kicking you out of the store.

The glass pieces themselves are not banned, nor are you banned from possessing them (unless of course you're using them to smoke pot, obviously).

If you were going to do that, then you should've given people who work downtown and in Brickell a chance to show up to work in the morning.  If scheduling the parade at 11 am meant you had to start shutting down Biscayne Blvd at 9 am, then you should've scheduled it for 1 pm.

1351688512.0,46,self.Miami,12e9qv,Goddamn Key Biscane bicyclists this morning. Can we please reach an agreement?,56,10,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/12e9qv/goddamn_key_biscane_bicyclists_this_morning_can/,"This morning on my commute to work in downtown, my car got fucking swarmed by bicyclists on US-1 by the Rickenbacker causeway. Let me start by saying that in the year that I've lived here, I've learned to tolerate the bicyclists because in the big picture, a herd of 60 or so bicyclists taking up a whole lane and sometimes two lanes, is really only a minor inconvenience. Not to mention the fact that I like to bicycle (not in Miami) and I like to run, so I'm cool with all of that. 

What I'm not cool with are the riders who create dangerous situations by blatantly ignoring traffic laws. Almost every morning, I see many cyclists plow through red lights into busy intersections, and I'm sure that they have decent judgement, but it is dangerous and puts a lot of unnecessary risk out there. 


So this morning I safely pass a group of 60+ bicyclists going towards the Rickenbacker causeway and come to a stop at a red light. I needed to make a right hand turn, so after waiting a couple seconds, I begin to make my turn. I'm cut short in the middle of my turn as all of those bicyclists I passed are overtaking my car on both the left and the right sides and converge directly in front of me.  As they pass me, they are yelling obscenities and hitting my car, to get my attention, I guess?  I sat there, stunned for a moment thinking about all of the ways that situation could have played out. What if any of those bicyclists crashed into my car and fell under?  


It's dangerous enough driving in Miami let alone trying to avoid bicyclists who seemingly have a death wish.  If we are all supposed to share the road, and I'm expected to respect the bicyclists right to exercise, why can't bicyclists respect my desire for a safe drive to work?

Each building ""off the chopping block"" is a homework / technology center reduced to less than half the hours you have now.  Insert a ""cadre of volunteers."" according to County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. 

Your 2013-14 taxes won't go down one nickel.  Just your services are slashed by 2/3.  What you were able to get with your library card is now reduced to less hours, less books, less time with a professional librarian, less access to the building. 

Two years ago the library was financially healthy and even had a $75 million reserve while all of the other departments were $250 million in the red.  

Now, with no public warning, seemingly overnight, the library system is bankrupted by Mayor Gimenez. On July 10th, our Mayor and seven commissioners rushed a vote in fifteen minutes to underfund the library and voila!  251 people are targeted for layoffs and you get a shadow or ""footprint"" of what you paid for over the decades.

The clerk isn't open on Saturday and my girlfriend is still suffering from the major buzzkill thanks to silly Florida bureaucracy.  I would love to tell her that we don't have to wait till Monday and that we can be wed this weekend, but I don't know anyone that can do it!

1347053825.0,36,self.Miami,ziyl2,Six Reasons Why (East) Little Havana is Miami's Best Place to Live.,64,28,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ziyl2/six_reasons_why_east_little_havana_is_miamis_best/,"Okay, so before I get hit with shit from every direction, let me specify that by ""live"" I do not mean raise a family.  With that out of the way, I'm going to tell you why I think Little Havana is such an underrated gem when it comes to finding a place here in Miami.  

1. It's cheap.  The average price for a spacious 1/1 is around $650, and you can easily find a 2/2 home for under $1300.  Sure many of these are beaten up buildings from the 1930s, but there are a few newer options, and the newer ones are still *very* affordable.  But that's not even the best part.  A lot of people don't realize that leases are not only extra negotiable, but often *nonexistent* in Little Havana.  Plenty of places will allow you to just move right in without signing a thing.  You don't like it?  No pressure, no contract.

2.) It's charming.  This part of the city has true character, and no amount of authenticity is sacrificed for the fairly heavy tourism.  Every day a bus full of pasty Europeans unloads on Calle Ocho, and El Pub's employees could still give two shits about speaking English for them.  There's nothing like crawling out of your apartment, slugging down a quick cafecito, and taking in the sights, sounds, and scents of 8th street.  I especially love that quick whiff of tobacco leaves you get when walking past a cigar shop.  I wish I could say the same about the reggaeton blasting out of random speakers.  

3.) It's safe.  Sure it looks sketchy here and there, but violent crime is definitely not a common occurrence.  Property crime happens, but you're at risk for that *anywhere* in Miami.  People hype the shit out of the design district and midtown, but those areas are far sketchier IMO.  I wouldn't suggest a solo female to walk the streets at 3 am, but that's just common sense.

4.) Calle Ocho parade.  Okay, whether you like it, hate it, or just enjoy the novelty, the idea of parking anywhere near Calle Ocho on this day, let alone driving, is beyond terrible.  But setting out on foot with some friends to devour arepas and get wrecked off of gasolina?  Sign me up!  Have to use the bathroom or just get away from the chongas?  Simply walk home =)  

5.) The food.  Nothing else needs to be said here.  A snapper fillet and two sides for $9?  You got it.

6.) By far the best perk on this list: it is the most conveniently central location in all of Miami!  The beach, downtown, design/midtown, coconut grove...they are all within 15 minutes.  Every main road is super accessible.  I-95?  Down the street.  The 836?  Down the street.  Want to head to South Miami?  US1 is down the street!!  Location, location, location.

So that's all folks.  Bitch all you want but I stand by it.  If you're new in town and want some real flavor, and aren't a posh queen with a turtle in your ass, check out this fine little area.

A car pulled up behind them and two black guys got out, each pulled a gun to their head and robbed them of everything they had. Our friend resisted a little bit and they threw her to the ground. 

Later that night, they robbed a lady on West and shot at her, but missed. Then they robbed a bakery and shot 5-6 times at a guy, but missed again. (idiots).

Well they tried using the stolen ATM cards around town with random pin numbers, but never got anything. They tried using the card at a mcdonalds and a camera finally identified the vehicle. 

The two guys are in jail and have admitted to 25 armed robberies in Miami over the past week. Their being charged with attempted murder and will probably be behind bars for the rest of their life. :)

I believe that by working together, in one united effort, we can make radical changes in the way cancer is viewed, treated, and cured in the world today. I believe we can beat this thing.

But I can't do it alone. 

Step 1. I've had an opportunity to work with some amazing people, and together we've started organizing a blood and bone marrow drive. We will be hosting it on April 29th at Elite U Fitness - 2801 SW 31st Ave  Miami, FL 33133 - from 5pm to 10pm. We need all the blood and marrow we can get. If you feel up to it, if you feel like you can commit, please leave a comment below or send me a DM. 

Finally, [here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfuCXkAGnrU) I recently made talking about why you should come out. It was a very spur of the moment thing so please forgive the poor quality. 

Thank you,

Complete set, [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/picturesofdorian/sets/72157626932187095/detail/).

First, I'd like to thank everyone for coming out from near and far on this momentous day. I can honestly say, I enjoyed meeting each and every single one of you. I honestly hope we all walked away better people from the experience, I know I sure as hell did. My dwindling faith in humanity stands corrected and rekindled. 

Furthermore, I truly hope everyone enjoyed themselves as much as I enjoyed putting in the work to organize it. ""If you build it, they will come."" is the only thing that crossed my mind as I saw us come together. 

I'd also like to thank Burger and Beer joint for being generous enough to accommodate us with our own exclusive drink special. Feel free to drop an equivalently generous review on the BnB Brickell Yelp page and show them some love if you had a good time there.

Lastly, I'm posting up the complete photo album publicly on Facebook [here](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150218472205496.318827.649280495). Tag yourself, tag others. Friend request the fuck out of me. The idea is that we all try to establish connections across Facebook. Keep in touch with anyone you met who you enjoyed meeting and would potentially want to meet up with again. That awesome guy/girl who does that awesome thing, who you would totally hang out with again but can't remember their name? Yea, they're fucking tagged on there. Say hello. 

The feedback in terms of another meetup was significant, expect another one soon. An organization in particular was impressed by our turn out and offered to collaborate with us in another one. I don't want to drop any names as it was only an offer and nothing concrete. 

I truly hope I get to see some of you IRL again and I hope some of you out there made some new friends. Till then... Karma whore!, everything is a repost, me gusta, and gtfo my internet. 


Cheers, 
Manny

I've never been to a meetup because I imagine, maybe incorrectly, that most people there are the people who post Miami hate here.

Nearly all of my life, save for a year and a half spent in Tallahassee, I've lived in Miami. I hated my city when I was 15, went away to Florida State, came back for a job opportunity, and slowly have been going out more, exploring the city, and realising that it's on the cusp of becoming a great symbol of 21st century urbanism. It has great potential to be the flagship city of this century.

When I travel, I tend to look at the subreddits for other cities, or I look just out of curiosity. San Diego, DC, NYC, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland... no one else seems to hate their city as ardently as /r/miami does. No one can ask a question about things to do here or where to move or how to get a job without someone telling them that our city is awful, that they shouldn't come here, and that Miami is just a bunch of racist Cuban pricks living in bad neighbourhoods. It really boggles my mind to imagine why anyone would still subscribe with so much hate for the city. The negativity oozes out of you. God forbid someone mention Hialeah, which to /r/miami is the biggest hell-hole on earth, for a number of reasons that are more often than not untrue and have no actual substance. You're literally hating just because it's popular to hate.

I was going to make this a post about Hialeah, but I've already done that before. Now I'm interested in why you care so much to be in this subreddit if you hate Miami. And I'm asking that genuinely, what draws you here if you hate living here so much? Why find a reason to think more about a city you'd like to be able to say you have nothing to do with?",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_1hw4yy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1hw4yy/meta_genuine_question_why_are_you_subscribed_to/,

(PICTURE BELOW) He is less than a year old according to the vet my girlfriend works at. We have put up some posters but no one has contacted us. We can't keep him due to the fact that he doesn't play well with our cats and we can't supply him with the proper growing environment. Please, we really don't want to give him to animal services because he is just too friendly with people and cute to be put down in 5 days! Please help us find a home for this little guy and if you can take him, even better!

Why is this such a popular thing?

I grew up and live in Hialeah. It's not a great place, there's really nothing spectacular here that stands out, but so what? It's just another suburban neighbourhood of Miami. The blocks in west Hialeah look like any random block from Westchester, or Kendall.

There's good Cuban food everywhere, there are good arts and city parks programs, and some of our schools aren't half bad (three years in a row, Hialeah Senior High got more kids into Ivy League and top-ranked schools than any *magnet* school in Miami).

The cops suck, like they suck everywhere in Miami. People speak Spanish, like they do everywhere in Miami. The politicians are corrupt, like they are from here to Florida City.

You complain about our streets. The same streets that are on the same type of grid system as the county, and the major avenues and roads use them dually. If you can count up and down from a number, you can't get lost in Hialeah, and you have no real reason to complain. Homestead, Miami Lakes, Opa-Locka, and Florida City all have their own grid system, but I never hear it about them.

A lot more people here know Spanish than I think it's assumed. If you walk into any bank, restaurant, or business, most people will know enough English to help you or have someone to help, if they're not fully fluent themselves. I've gone out with plenty of 'white' friends here and I've never seen them, us, or anyone get bad service just because the Spanish wasn't great.

So what gives? Most of the reasons to hate Hialeah are blown wildly out of proportion. Do you guys just hate on us for the sake of hating on us?",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_1awxbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1awxbj/lets_talk_about_hialeah/,

My name is Lydia - I'm a longtime lurker and I have another account, but I made this one for a specific reason. I need help. I've had a rough family situation for a while, but it's escalated in recent months aaand I just got kicked out.

I really don't have anywhere to go. The few close friends I have either can't help out or are away. I'm at an acquaintance's for tonight but they've made it clear they can only open their house to me for a night or two, if that.

This is difficult for me to ask, but I really have no viable options right now. If anybody could possibly give me a place to crash, it would (probably literally) be a lifesaver. I can couchsurf or floorsurf - I'm not asking for a five star resort. I'll be a good guest - I'll clean, help out however I can, and cook if you're up for it. I don't currently have a job but I'd get right to looking for one as soon as I have a place to sleep.

I'm in the West Kendall area - I'll give you my address if you message me with a serious response. I can probably arrange a ride if you're within a decent distance, but can find a way even if you're not.

I promise I'm not a serial killer or otherwise insane - which I know can be empty words on the 'webz, but I think I'm taking a big risk myself. That's just what it's come to.

If you can help or know anybody who would be willing to help, let me know. DFTBA.

Both my father and mother want to upgrade to a new iPhone 5. We begin the process with the sales rep. He looks up the account info and verifies that they are both eligible to upgrade their handsets. Before we proceed with the upgrade, the sales rep lets me know that **in order for him to sell me the iPhone we have to purchase an accessory for each handset.** I thought I had heard incorrectly and asked for clarification. He proceeded to let me know that **it's their store policy, any customer who is purchasing an iPhone (new line or upgrade) needs to purchase an accessory along with the phone. He then suggested that if I didn't want to have to purchase an accessory, I could go across the street to a non corporate store or I could go to Best Buy.** At this point, I ask if his manager is there and patiently wait for her to come and explain the situation. While waiting for the manager to finish with another customer, I went ahead and placed a call to Sprint Customer Care to verify if this ""Policy"" was a corporate instituted policy. The first customer care rep I spoke to said she had no knowledge of this, but she said stores are free to set their own sales policies. I politely asked to be transferred to her floor manager or supervisor. While on hold I went ahead and interrupted the store manager because I wanted an explanation. According to her, **this policy was set by the district manager and there is nothing she can do.** I proceeded to take her information along with the information of the district manager before I left. As I was driving home I finally got connected to the floor manager at the call center. I explained the situation and he said he had never heard of such a thing. He asked to place me on hold to confirm with the other floor managers to see if they had heard of this ""policy"" before. He quickly came back on the line and apologized and said that he was going to write up this store because he had never heard of corporate issuing this policy. The manager of corporate sales is supposed to call me tomorrow to clarify the situation.   

**tl;dr Sprint is forcing customers who want to purchase an iPhone 5 at their stores to bundle an accessory because they are running low on stock. Called corporate customer care and they have no idea what the local corporate store is talking about. Said they are going to report store.**

Initially I was somewhat on the fence about the libraries that are slated to close.  It's true that I don't use the libraries as much as I did growing up in the 1980's and 90's.  The Internet has changed my reading habits.

But I was thinking about the loss of public spaces and I think the libraries are worth saving.  Little kids still go to book readings.  I am signed up for a free Saturday native landscaping course at the West Kendall branch.  

The comments on the Herald focus on the fact that many homeless people use libraries.  I've read nasty quips about the homeless enjoying the ""free air conditioning.""  If we close the libraries it doesn't solve the homeless problem.  

My $10 donation isn't much but maybe if many of you join in, it will  collectively send a message that the libraries are important to us as a community.  ",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_1k1zt3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1k1zt3/i_just_donated_10_to_the_friends_of_the_miami/,

I’m a 25 year old male grad student from Munich/Germany and I’m moving to Miami in August to start a MBA at FIU. I have no idea what I’m getting myself into. 


I’ve been subscribed to this subreddit for quite a while, I have read a lot about Miami and watched the 2nd season of The Jersey Shore, so I’m starting to get a picture of what Miami is like. Everybody is from Cuba, drivers are loose cannons, traffic is hell, public transportation almost non-existent and finding an apartment tough. Also, people are obnoxious.


Anyway, I still want to go. I have some questions and it would be great if you could help me out! You would make me as happy as [this penguin](http://i.imgur.com/Upk7eCq.jpg) at Disney World made me when I last visited Florida some 20 years ago.


So, here's what I need help with:


1. The discussions on this subreddit have given me the impression that Coconut Grove, Coral Gables and Brickell are the neighborhoods that I should mainly look into. My financial limit for accommodation is ca. 800-900$/month, so finding a nice place just for myself in those neighborhoods might be difficult. I’ve lived in shared apartments for the last 5 years and might want to do the same in Miami. Unfortunately, most ads on Craigslist are very vague to say the least and people seem to care very little about who they live with. Are there any better websites that i should look into?
Another option for me would be to look for a condo or efficiency in cheaper neighborhoods such as Little Havanna. I’ve lived in Medellín/Colombia and other Latin American countries and speak Spanish fluently. I’ve never had bigger problems in Latin America and have mostly felt safe, even although I look as German as they come. Because of all that and my general interest in Spanish and Latin American culture (and food) I thought about moving to a predominantly hispanic neighborhood. Any recommendations or is that a bad idea? Are there any areas that I should avoid at all costs?


2. Unfortunately I don’t have a driver’s license. I could either try to get a license or find a way to somehow get along without a car. 
Getting a driver’s license in Germany would cost me more than 2000$ so now I’m considering getting it in Miami. The rants about Miami drivers in this subreddit make me wonder how difficult and cheap it can be to get one? Is it true that you need your own car for the practical driving test and if so, where would I get a car from without having a license? Any idea if there are any restrictions concerning driver’s licenses for foreigners? And is it really that difficult to get around without a car? What about cycling?


3. In Germany I live comfortably off about 1000$/month (plus rent). I go out quite a lot and like to eat out once in a while. I go to concerts, exhibitions and festivals. I would like to do the same kind of stuff in Miami. Would my budget allow that or should I start saving more money?


4. Miami is often described as a very superficial, materialistic and rude city. I don't care much about fitness, status and image. I’m more of a culturally, philosophically and politically interested person. I enjoy indie, punk and DIY concerts, I like run-down bars, underground techno parties, bookstores, political discussions and independent cinema. I know, I sound like somebody who should move to Portlandia, but well, I'm going to Miami. Does that mean that i'm screwed or are there places and events in Miami where I might meet people like me and do the things that I enjoy?

I gotta say, I like what you've done with the place. You have weekly meetups, were quick to answer any of my questions or concerns, and have given awesome guides for those coming to your beautiful city! 

Out of inspiration and slight boredom, I have decided to write a review of sorts that lists the highs and lows and everything in between during my stay in South Beach. Let me preface it by reminding you that this is COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE. I understand that everybody has very different experiences and does very different things, but this is what my three friends and I experienced on our college spring break.

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**
Great weather (duh)
Friendly locals and helpful public employees
Absolutely horrendous public transportation
Extremely accessible and diverse beyond belief

So here's a little breakdown of how our first day went: 

We arrived in Ft. Lauderdale and took the shuttle to the Tri-Rail, got on the metro, and took a bus into South Beach. While we only spent about 5 bucks each, it took almost an equal amount in hours. That was rough on the morale considering we were on spring break!

We stayed at the [Majestic](http://www.majesticsouthbeach.com/) hotel on 7th and Ocean. Yes I know, it is one of those places with a lady up your ass about a seafood special and happy hour, but it was dirt cheap and as close as humanly possible to the beach. We were able to relax on the beach for an hour or two before the sun went down.

**Beach Life**
The weekend was DRASTICALLY different than the weekdays. Locals swarmed [Lummus Park Beach](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lummus-park-on-south-beach-miami-beach) on the weekend, and quite honestly felt a tad unsavory. I am more accustomed to beaches such as Myrtle or Outer Banks. The weekdays were relaxed college students sipping alcohol and just chilling, making for a much better time.

Cops were an enormous pain in the ass. They were like flies, constantly driving up and down the beach, barraging anyone with a cooler and giving out tickets willy-nilly.

Bottom line, Lummus Park is a great place Monday-Thursday. Significantly fewer people and a more relaxed and happy atmosphere.

**Night Life**
Bracelets bracelets bracelets! Holy god, I have never been given so many of those paper bracelets! The weird thing is that they were actually beneficial. We paid a much cheaper price at [SoBe Live](http://www.sobelivesouthbeach.com/), and got a great package deal for Nikki Beach and Catalina. 

We were only two blocks from [Clevelander](http://www.clevelander.com/) and my buds and I agreed that it was the most well-rounded club. It is outdoors, has a dancefloor, and a couple bars. Of course the drinks are overpriced, but that's what pregaming is for! I met some awesome girls and it was super convenient to the hotel. ;)

In second comes the package deal from [Catalina](http://catalinahotel.com/) hotel. For 20 bucks each, a group of about 20 of us got an open bar for two hours at Catalina (on 17th st.), a party bus ride to [Nikki Beach](http://www.nikkibeach.com/), and free entry to NB. Suffice to say I got demolished at Catalina and vaguely remember the bus ride or even taking a girl out to the beach and having some fun.

**Food**
Spaghetto (I can't find any links online). For the love of god, go to this place. It is a hole-in-the-wall Italian place where the owner makes the pasta by hand every single day. It was 10 bucks for a bowl of pasta with protein, a salad, and a drink. Fantastic deal IMHO. It's located on Washington between 5th and 6th if my memory serves me correct.

[Tap-Tap](http://www.southbeach-usa.com/restaurants/misc/tap-tap/tap-tap.htm). Fantastic Haitian food but jesus christ it was the slowest service I have ever encountered. I got the Tilapia, and my friends got the shrimp and roasted chicken. We all loved it. Prices are a little steep, but it had a great decor and amazing food.

[Pizza Rustica](http://www.pizza-rustica.com/). I know it's a chain of sorts, but the slices were huge and a great after-beach food. The prices were reasonable and I highly recommend it.

**Shopping**
Don't waste your time. I love clothes, but I also love a bank account. Save your money and time and skip shopping. If you feel the need, keep it to a minimum. The shops on Collins honestly were nothing spectacular and pretty run of the mill. (Gap, Quicksilver, Urban Outfitters, Benetton). 

I do recommend, though, making a trip to [Lincoln Road](http://www.lincolnroad.org/) around sunset. The strip is never-ending, relaxing, and pretty damn easy on the eyes too.

**REGRETS**
Not visiting the Keys. I got some [very sage advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ps0w6/car_rentals_for_a_day/) on car rentals from you fine folks and I never even followed through. It was a mixture of laziness and time constraints. But damn, I really should have made the time. I have been a couple times before but they are something never to be missed.

Not spending enough time in actual Miami. The lack of a car was tough. Having homebody friends who only want to drink and sit on the beach? Makes it even harder. Get to Miami! Do it for me!

**Pros**
Clubs and partying is accessible every hour of every day. We got home at 6 a.m. one day!
Girls girls girls. Need I say more?
Pristine oceans and easy access from hotels.
Food from every corner of the earth everywhere you go!
Locals are extremely friendly and helpful.
Miami Heat game was only 20 bucks a pop and we got great seats. Who would have thought!?

**Cons**
Prices are obnoxious. But come on, you knew that coming in. Be careful with your checkbook and you should be ok.
Clubs can be extremely hit-or-miss and racially quarantined. 
Hotel-front restaurant venders are a fucking nuisance. You learn to just ignore them.
It can be kind of dangerous as the night carries on. Don't walk alone, always stay in a group.",,False,,t5_2qi76,True,,,True,t3_qq12e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/qq12e/a_traveler_giving_his_two_cents_on_mainly_south/,

I was just wondering how many of you actually live in Hialeah. 

I'm not really into the clubbing scene, and I don't go downtown or to the beach much, so I thought it would be cool if we could organize some kind of local hangouts, even if it's something as simple as grabbing food at Cici's, shopping at Westland, or catching a matinée at the Muvico nearby - I believe it even has an arcade now. Maybe we could even start an informal organization that meets up from time to time for board games or cafe con leche. Nothing over-the-top - I imagine a lot of you who live here aren't really out of the closet, and I don't blame you.

If you're queer, questioning, or just straight and willing to hang out without judging, leave a comment and make yourself visible. I know I can't be the only gay guy in Hialeah that isn't into Miami's nightlife. A lot of us probably don't really appreciate Hialeah, but I bet meeting other people would help us foster some greater sense of belonging and community here. And who knows? Maybe there are some places nearby you'd enjoy but have never heard about.

",34,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/17wy0s/tradewinds_bar_in_bayside_the_worst_experience_of/,"So pretty much, my partner and I decided to hang out at Bayside on our day off. We heard about ""Tradewinds"", a bar that offered ""2-4-1"" specials on all liquor from 4-7. After waiting over an hour to have our drink order taken at the bar, though there was LITERALLY NO ONE at the bar, we wre invited with only hate and unnecessary rude service. As I waited for my beer to come, I overheard the bartender, LOUDLY, exclaim ""Wow, that fucking faggot really asked for a splash of cranberry? What a fucking piece of shit. Fuck that idiot"", que the rest of the staff laughing. After drinking our beers, we clearly felt unwelcomed, and asked for our tab. This is the horrifying part. Our tab came out to 12(Twelve) dollars, after waiting for our bartender to split that between two debit cards, the manager suddenly showed up and confronted my partner and I, saying ""Really? Are you two actually splitting this tab?"" infront of ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE, as loud as possible. We sat in silence, confused, and he continued to charged us both 9 dollars each instead. When we asked how 18(Eighteen) dollars can equal 12(Twelve), he sighed, and left. We had no  service afterwards, and the manager refused to speak to us. 

Please, heed my word,  

do not approach this bar, as they only cater to the ones they like. I saw MANY customers turned away by TERRIBLE customer service during my time sitting at the bar. The bartenders name was Elizabeth, and the manager refused to give us his name. 

Please help us in potentially changing the way this bar is run, and hopefully getting rid of the monsters in charge. 

Thank you. 


TLDR; 
Tradewinds is a bar run by animals with no respect towards customers. Many people were disrespected and humiliated behind the scenes, and the manager was horribly rude when taking control of financial problems.

Some of the galleries visited will be: Coral Gables Museum, the ArtSight Gallery, The Americas Collection, the Ninoska Huerta Gallery, the Durban Segnini Gallery, and Cernuda Arte. Art ranges from jewelry to fine art and takes a variety of forms, including sculptures. You can explore the area with a map, popping in any gallery you choose, or take a trolley to save some time.

I would like to start at the Books &amp; Books (they have a nice selection of craft beers) on 265 Aragon Avenue at 7pm for a little pre-gaming. No, the bar there isn't free but many of the galleries do provide free wine and finger foods. At about 7:30/8pm, we can jump on the trolley and get off at whatever gallery might peak our interests! As the date nears, I will post my phone number &amp; some more info (if anyone actually shows interest in going, that is). So what do you say, r/Miami?

Leave a comment if you wish for this to happen. Redditors of Miami unite!


P.S. PM me if you wish for any requests or questions.

**Edit:**  I guarantee that this meet-up will stay in Miami.  Also, I will PM all of you once we have a good number of redditors remind you of the meet-up and tell you the date/time.

**Edit2:**  Okay, there are at least 10 people in this thread who are willing to attend.  I will wait until Friday to see if anyone else responds, and that should give me a rough number of attendees.  I will then PM those who want to go to coordinate a convenient date/time.

**Triple ninja edit:** I am in the process of talking to Yardhouse and setting a date/time.  Be on the look out for a new post in /r/Miami with all the details.

I'm a 30yr male and I've had an exceptionally rough week, that has capped off an exceptionally rough several months, and I'd like to meet some new people in Miami (I don't have many friends here). 
I thought using Game of Thrones, which is currently my favorite show, as a vehicle was a good idea. Live in midtown, have a big 65"" tv, HBO, lotsa booze. Don't care what you look like or what you do, as long as you're a cool/smart person and looking for a potential friend. 

If you're just interested in meeting someone new, and not interested in GoT, feel free to send me a note anyway--that was obviously not a requirement, just an idea.
Thanks!

I've got a couple ideas but I would love to hear from the community. The plan is to kind of keep the distances equal between Miami and Ft Lauderdale so we don't have people driving up from Miami Beach or Kendall area to go to Las Olas and vice versa.

It would be taking place on Reddit Meetup Day, June 23rd. So open up your calendars and come meet some new people.

As soon as we have all the entries for locations, we will vote on the location of the meetup and begin planning. I know it is still a ways off, but I would rather have people know ahead of time so that in case people drop out or have emergencies, we will be able to plan for the absence.

I will be creating a separate thread tonight to be the voting/planning thread.

Wood Tavern - I've got two people so far vouching for this venue. Seems like a chill down to earth bar. Would be a nice place to go for those redditors that had to work if we choose to have the meeting during the day.

* 
Oleta Park - This was just recently thrown in and after looking on the map it is the only park brought up so far that would be fair to both Miami and Ft. Lauderdale.
[Info on Oleta Park](http://www.floridastateparks.org/oletariver/)

              -For those of you in Ft. Lauderdale, Oleta is a 30in straight shot down I-95.
              -For those of you in Miami and surrounding areas it goes as such:
                      South Beach and surrounding areas: 35min up A1A or 25min up I-95 w/o traffic
                      Kendall and surrounding areas: 45min straight shot up the Palmetto
                      Miramar/Pembroke Pines/Davie: 25-35min dependent on location
                                     

* 
Crandon Park - Two people vouching for this venue. Apparently this is where last years meetup was held. Scru made a good point that it would allow the under 21 crew to join in on the meetup and then for those of you who couldn't make it too the beach due to work or other constraints, some of us could head to one of the bars in Miami and do an ""afterparty"" of sorts at on of the bars. This way no one is completely left out. 
[Info on Crandon Park](http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/crandon_park_beach.asp)

* 
Markham Park - Another excellent spot with jet ski rentals, RC planes, plenty of BBQ space, and even the possibility of a bounce house lol. [Info on Markham Park](http://www.broward.org/parks/markhampark/Pages/Default.aspx)

* 
Baseball Game - Cheapish, and the new Marlins stadium is a rather pretty place. Little Havana is also right next door and can serve as the after game bailout area.

**Crandon** **Park**, **Key** **Biscayne** **1pm**:

-BYOBB (Bring your own booze bro)

-Bring any outdoor activities you enjoy; balls, frisbee, anything.

-Bring some food, whether grill-able or ready to eat, it's all good. (Hot dogs, burgers, any meat/food in general.)

-Enter through the ""South Beach Crandon Park"" entrance, I will be placing signs to guide the rest of the way to the location in the park.

-Feel free to bring any Reddit accessories or themed items.


**Burger** **and** **Beer** **Joint**, **Brickell** **7pm**:

-We will be gathering in the sports bar area, not the dining area.

-After speaking with the management they arranged $3 Domestic beers and $5 Well drinks as drink specials exclusively for our group. Just say you're from Reddit, the internet, ""give me my beer wench"", etc. etc. AWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAHHHH!!

-Feel free to also bring any Reddit themed accessories or items. (I will most likely be rocking some kind of ridiculous party hat making myself distinguishable; so just look for me and say hi, I'll be very drunk and friendly by then.)

So far, we're one of the largest meetups out of the 165 taking place world wide, let's show some fucking pride in that and recreate our own The Hangover movie this weekend.

It was the most annoying crowd I have ever experienced in a movie theater. To start off the night, a drunk couple behind us decided to discuss the movie in Spanish as if they were watching it in their living room at home. It wasn't a soft wisper to explain the move to eachother, no, it was a full on conversation about every stupid little detail and at full volume. Some other guy and I both got up and went to get a manager because we really couldn't hear the movie over their conversation and the couple did not listen to the people shushing them. The manager came in and quietly stood in the dark and they still kept on with their conversation oblivious to everyone around them. Finally the manager talked to them and they kept quiet throughout the rest of the movie. After that little episode was over, a short while later someone's cellphone starts ringing. I assumed it was an accident and they forgot to put it on vibrate but nope. A few minutes later it rings again and they actually answer the call on speakerphone! Apparently it was either their mother or the wife they were cheating on calling them because I heard them reply ""Mami, Mami"" to the muffled voice on the phone. The guy only turned it off after someone in the back yelled, and I quote, ""turn that fucking shit off, man!"". So now that little show was over. Finally, during about the last 30 minutes of the movie someone fell asleep and they started to snore. Whoever they were sitting with did not have the courtesy to wake them up and tell them to keep quiet. We all watched the end of the movie with the wonderful soundtrack of someone sleeping. And that is how I spent my Saturday night! ",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_12mpeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/12mpeq/classy_ass_people_in_this_city/,

I thought I would give this a shot: Anyone have recommendations for the following services? Firms you have worked with, do good work or that you  know are fair?

We have some remodeling to do before we can move, so we are figuring February or March before actually moving in.

I am going to need: 

1) Two driveways and a concrete pad poured

2) Two damaged/dead Palm Trees removed (Root ball too)

3) A fence guy (Style depends on cost)

4) A plumber

5) An Air Conditioner guy

6) A yard guy

7) What ISP is best for that area? I need dependable, high-speed access since I telecommute.

The closest laser tag place is [Laser Quest](http://www.laserquest.com/public/locations/FL-Sunrise.cfm) in Sunrise, FL, and a successful meetup happened there last month so we know it's a good place. It's only $8.25 to play, and on Saturdays it's open from noon to midnight. 

I have a car and can drive four others, and if anyone else can volunteer to drive as well that would be great. Let's meet up at 2:00 PM at the Starbucks across from the University of Miami at 1122 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables. I plan to leave the Starbucks at 2:20 latest, so make sure to get there before then! If you want to meet us at Laser Quest, we'll probably arrive around 3:15 to 3:30. 

Afterwards, anyone who feels like it can come out for food/drinks. We'll pick the place after we laser tag depending on what we're craving. Personally, I vote for a pub with burgers.

**Note: WE NEED MORE DRIVERS. If you have a car, please volunteer. Most people can probably donate a few dollars for gas. Otherwise, we'll have to tie about 10 people to the top of my car.** 

**Seriously, we won't get there if we don't have more drivers.**

Miami Fun and Inexpensive MeetUp group will be having a 80s Party and Cosplay Night at Arcade Odyssey.

http://www.meetup.com/MiamiFunInexpensive/events/78659152/

Take a trip back in time with us to a Retro 80's Night Party at Arcade Odyssey! Arcade Odyssey is the Best Video Game and Pinball Arcade in Miami.

The arcade is packed with loads of hard to find pinball machines, rare Japanese video game imports, as well as Retro 80's games that will bring you back to a time when Ronald Regan was President, Madonna was still like a Virgin, and women wore pony tails on the side of their heads. The arcade is also stocked with a number of inexpensive imported Japanese Drinks, and Snacks.



On this night only, Arcade Odyssey will be magically transformed by Miami Fun &amp; Inexpensive into a Crazy 80s Party with multiple fun Events!:

Part I

7 PM..80's &amp; Cosplay Costume Contest- Make sure to arrive and check in dressed in 80's attire or come as your favorite 80's Cosplay character (like Don Johnson, Madonna, He-man, Rainbow Brite, Jem, Transformers, Pac-Man, etc.) for the Cosplay Costume Contest. All who come dressed in 80's attire or in a Cosplay costume will automatically receive free tokens to play games, and an even bigger Prize will be awarded later in the night to the winner of the costume contest!

Part II

Classic 80s Video Games Tournament... 8:00 PM There will be a Classic 80s Video Games Tournament (Think 80s games like Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Frogger, Q-bert, etc.). There will be a small entrance fee of a few dollars for this tournament, and prizes given out to the winner!

Part III

9:30 pm ...The Totally Rad 80's Trivia Contest!

Do you know the name of Doc Brown's Dog in 1985? What about the one he had in 1955? We will be hosting a Totally Rad 80's Trivia Contest, to see if you have the right stuff, or if you are going to be spending your summer in Summer School, eating Pizza and learning about Cuba, with fellow classmate Jeff Spicoli.


Part IV

Challenge Accepted...10PM

Challenge Accepted, created by Arcade Owner/Proprietor Rick Medina is 50% Jack Ass, 50% Fear Factor,  and 100% Awesome! Challengers will play head to head in some of the most rarest and bizarre video games.

I went to trial when I was 16 with accusations against my father. I left the home at 18, and since then my father has moved back.

For a while now there have been plans to remove my father from the household, however due to a recent turn of events things have moved forward and the children may be taken from the home today.

My elder brother lives nearby and may be able to take in one of them; also my elder sister also lives in Miami and could take in a couple of them. However, I would have to take in at the bare minimum one of them, but more than likely, at least two. I currently live in a studio/efficiency in what is called the ""apartments"" of the University dorms. It is very liberal here, meaning that if I took in a kid or two, if they make no ruckus, nobody here would notice or even care. However, that does not mean that the case worker will let them stay with me.

The end of the first summer semester ends in a couple of days. I am planning to withdraw from the university dorms and live off-campus. However, on such short notice I am having trouble finding a place. This is where I would really appreciate your help.

I am looking for a place close to FIU, as I don't own a car -- I do own a bicycle, though -- It would ideally be a 1-bedroom, but an efficiency/studio is okay too. I can't afford much more than $1050 a month, although ideally speaking I would like it around $800. A place with utilities included in the rent would be great. I can't have a place without a stove, as I would obviously need to cook for them. A/C is a must, and if there were a washer/dryer within the community that would be fantastic.

This is me with the two youngest: http://i.imgur.com/XHexF.jpg

Please, any help would be very much appreciated. If you know of any place, or a great site to look up such a place. Or (and I know this may be asking a lot) if anyone has any skills with search engines and could help me look up such a place. Please.

EDIT: I am already aware of Vista Verde, so thank you for your help if you offer that as a choice, but it is a little over budget so I would like to avoid that if possible.

EDIT2: Homes for rent are okay too, because then my elder sister and I could just combine our wallets.

I took my PS3 for repair at The SmartPhone Clinic in Plantation, thanks to a friend's suggestion. I had a MINOR graphics glitch, my PS3 played games, connected to the internet, did everything, it was just a minor pixel issue with 3D models. Since I had the extra money, I figured I would get it taken care of. I dropped it off on January 17, they said it was my graphics chip. They said they fixed it, called me up and said it was ready to go. I came and picked up up on Jan 31.
I took it home, turned it on and it had the same problem. I called them up, they said to bring it back in, so I did. When I got in this time, there was a different technician, I told him what the problem was and he said ""Oh yeah, we have had some of those come back, we got some local cheap American graphics chips that are failing and we are waiting for a shipment of good Chinese chips"". I said fine, I just want it repaired.

So weeks go by, I call one time and I get an ""apprentice"" technician who said he didnt have any info on it but there was a post it on it that said ""needs graphics chip"" and that I should talk to the real technician about that. I informed him that is the original reason I put it in repair.

I called the next day, talked to the technician who said my PS3 was unrepairable. I asked him why, what was wrong with it..... his response was ""It cant be repaired"". I asked him when it will be back in the store so I can pick it up, he said the next day (Saturday) and then I asked about a refund, he said he wasnt sure I was entitled to one but I would have to speak to someone at the store.

I tried calling on Saturday to see if my PS3 was in, it was not. I called Monday, was told they didnt know and they would give me a call back. I didnt get one. I called again yesterday (Thursday) and was told they just got a shipment of PS3s in and they had to sort it out and would call me back. They didnt. I called today and finally they said my PS3 was back from repair, I said I was coming to get it and I asked about the refund, luckily they agreed to give me a full refund.
When I got there, I noticed that a front panel was missing from my PS3, I even checked my serial number to make sure it was actually mine, they matched up. I asked about it and they said they must have forgot to put it back on and asked if I can come back in a few days to get it. I informed them that this was by far the worst experience I have had with any service company. They apologized. I got my refund, and they said they hoped I would still consider doing business with them. I left with my PS3.

I get home and go to turn it on and it is not getting any power. NO POWER. I gave it to them 98% functional except a minor annoying graphics glitch and they gave it back to me completely broken. I called up the repair center. The ""head tech"" barely let me get a word in. I was crying on the phone. Finally I yelled and said it would be nice if he would let me finish my sentences. He told me that the first time they gave it to me (Jan 31) they actually forgot to repair it. He said he was sorry but it was going to eventually die anyway. He said he couldnt do anything about it.
I got my PS3 back in far worse condition than when I sought their help originally.
https://www.facebook.com/TheSmartPhoneClinic

TL;DR sent my PS3 in for a nosejob and got a corpse in return two months later.

EDIT:  I would also like to make it clear, my frustration and anger does not come from my ps3 being broken, my anger stems from me working as a computer technician in a retail setting. I've been there. I went out of my way for customers I didn't even know. The way this situation was handled boils down to this I was lied to (the first time they gave it to me they told me it was fixed and tested, when it wasn't even opened up) I never once got a phone call back. I was never told that it was now 100% broken, I didn't find out until I got home. Parts were missing from my ps3 when I got it back. When I called and shared my concern, instead of having a system in place for the rare occasion this happens (I was told about 1% of the time), I was giving the big fuck you and told ""your ps3 was going to break eventually anyway"". I was crying on the phone from frustration and then told ""I hope you will still use us in the future"".",,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,t3_r18g4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/r18g4/warning_smartphone_clinic/,

A friend of mine and myself started this company to help the community of homebrewing grow here in Miami, because Florida is really behind. We got into brewing at FIU taking the brewing class and became hooked, it is super addicting, interesting and when you break it down very economical. 

We are just starting but we have a membership set up so you can brew a couple times a month, one of the times we give you all the materials, we have space to ferment your beer and the tools to either bottle or keg it.

It also makes a great date night.

I cross the street to go to Simpson Park in Brickell (at the roundabout between South Miami Ave and SE 15th) and this guy in an SUV with his handicapped elderly father in the passenger seat honks at me when i'm in the middle of the crosswalk. like it's absolutely unbearable that he had to move his foot and apply the brake to let me cross the crosswalk. 
the next one (same roundabout, different side of the crosswalk) was a husband and wife in a mercedes that screeched to a halt in front of me and acted like i didn't have the right of way. i pointed to the crosswalk signs with my hands. the woman motioned to me and said ""look where you're going"" and i gave them the finger and told them to learn how to drive. people have no patience in this city.

according to FDOT, pedestrians have the right of way in marked crosswalks. i thought this was common sense, but i guess i'm mistaken. 

Here's an excerpt from the FDOT site on pedestrian laws:  ‎"" A pedestrian who sets foot in a (marked or unmarked) crosswalk where traffic signals are not in place, or are in place but not operating, obliges an approaching driver to yield the right of way, so long as it is feasible for the driver to do so. The driver's duty to yield applies regardless of whether the crossing location is controlled by any signs (Stop or Yield). Yielding may take the form of slowing or stopping; safe yielding requires stopping (and waiting) if the crossing pedestrian is in the driver's lane, in the lane into which the driver is turning, or in an adjoining lane.""

granted, the law says that drivers must yield when feasible to do so, which i think is reasonable, but in a wide open roundabout/crosswalk like the one at South Miami and SE 15th, with a 15mph speed limit, you're able to see and yield to any pedestrians crossing the street. people just... don't.

I'm posting this on behalf of a friend whose daughter left her cat (Link to picture below) with her when she moved overseas with the promise of finding her a good home. Of course that never happened and now my friend  moving to a smaller place, which unfortunately does not allow pets. The cats name is Tsubasa, she is declawed and 6 years old but still very playful.

My friend has called all the local shelters and they've said that they're all so crowded (something about ""stray cat season"") that the cat would most likely be put to sleep if she took them to the shelter.

I wish I could take the cat, unfortunately my current living situation doesn't allow for it either, same with all my friends.

If you, or someone you know, can provide a good home for Tsubasa please PM me and I can put you in touch with my friend.

I got x-rays, and no broken broken, but I will be in a sling for up to six week while my muscle relearns to man up, so I won't be able to make it tomorrow.  We can either reschedule or, as I'd prefer, you guys can just go on without me.

**Round Two:**  Looks like the majority of people are interested in a Saturday the 10th morning ride.  What I thought would work best would be a 10:00 to 11:00 AM meet up time at the first parking lot (or more likely directly across from it in the picnic area) of Matheson Hammock.  At 11, we would leave, heading north on the bike path and do an 11 mile ride (which should take about an hour at the estimated speed).  The [route](http://bit.ly/opy440) I mapped out would have us doing approximately 8 miles on bike paths and 3 miles on the street or sidewalk (depending on rider comfort level), and have us taking paths north to the grove and then circling around and taking the M Path back to Matheson Hammock.  From there we can commence with the beer and food (which was presumably left in coolers in our cars)!

**Original Message:**  Wanted to see if there was any interest for a group bike ride, potentially next Friday night or Saturday morning.  I would love to suggest something like going out to Shark Valley, but with the rapid onset thunder storms and heat, I don't think that's a good idea.  For this reason, we would probably be sticking to some of the area bike paths.  If we go Friday, maybe we can end up at a bar for some beers? Alternately, we could finish up a Saturday ride at Matheson Hammock for a picnic? ",,False,,t5_2qi76,True,,,True,t3_jy374,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/jy374/reddit_group_bike_ridemeet_up/,

Long story short, I'm deeply struggling with anxiety and depression. I've always been one to suck it up and say ''tomorrow will be better'' but after a certain point that's not good enough anymore. I'm afraid I've reached that point. It's been getting worse and my professional and personal life are suffering because of it. The hopelessness and thoughts of suicide (I would never, but the thoughts are there) are also beginning to scare me. I don't know what to do anymore. 


The point of my post being, I have a Medicaid plan but they do not cover mental health at all, I've asked several times. I want to know if there are any options for affordable mental care for me in Miami, or if you have any recommendations. At this point any option would be more than welcome and helpful.

He's an awesome companion and needs a home without other dogs where someone will spend time with him to train him and exercise him. He is housebroken, crate-trained, and is working on clicker-training and taking to it like a natural! He's about 35 pounds, and will be 45-ish when he's done growing, according to the vet.

I'd also like to see if any of us Redditors would like to make it a sort-of regular thing (with t-shirts, of course, I love me some t-shirts). The corporate team builds are actually $100 per participant but we can always just register as individuals and sign up for particular projects together.

Not that I have anything against anyone trying to bone each other. I just don't like drinking.

Anyways, I think it'd be cool if we all, as a group, did regular charity events of some sort but I saw HfH as particularly relevant considering we are a city-based subreddit.

So let's do this! How's Friday March 30th work out? I figure that gives us enough time to spread the word a bit, and maybe have some others work up the courage to hang! Oh and if I may nerd out a sec - ssf4ae, guilty gear, melty blood, kof13, capcom vs snk, xmen 4 player, and other sexy cabs are present. 

*edit 2* 
Stoked so many people are down to hang! Let's setup a time. I was thinking after 7pm? Let everyone get home from work and do their thing? 

*edit 3 - final details*
So its set! This Friday after 7pm at Arcade Odyssey! In the TexMex shopping plaza across the street from McDonalds on 117th ave just south of 120St (SW).  Hit up ferveo for info on the shirts to commemorate this super awesome meet up!

When I received all the court papers home, I realized that I have been paying for the past 18 months for nothing.


To be short: I have been paying a Realtor for 18 months, who didn't pay the owner (as he died 2 years ago and didn't leave any heirs), and who didn't pay the bank. The realtor has been pocketing the money all this time and that kind of pisses me off.


I was advised to open an ""escrow account"" and to start depositing my rent money in here. I assume that the realtor will not give a shit about that and will kick me out as they are not receiving their rent (which is technically not their...).


Anybody with the same situation? What did you do? How did it go?

Two of my friends that I work with have a 2/2 at the Vue, and they're moving out at the end of January because the company we work for is making them relocate. I want to move in but I need someone else to move in with me.

About the place, like I said it's the Vue, 1250 South Miami Ave. With everything included (rent, self parking, utilities, etc.) it'll come out to $1,100 a month each. They also said that they're going to be leaving some furniture behind including big ticket items like one or two beds, table, etc. so overall it's a good deal.

About myself, I'm 22, originally from NY, graduated in the spring, been in Miami since September. Work full time, 8:30-6:30 typically during the week. Like to go out on the weekend. Overall I'm a laid back guy.

If you're interested let me know! I figured I would try here before posting an ad on craigslist because I would rather live with another redditor than some sketch off craigslist.

I found a kitten.,20,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tt5a2/hey_rmiami_i_found_a_kitten/,"Hi guys, as the title suggests I found a baby kitten. It got itself stuck in the engine of my roommate's car so I brought it inside, cleaned it up and fed it. 

However, I can't keep it. I already have a dog and can't afford a kitten. Being sort of new to the area, I'm not really sure what sort of action I should be taking. I feel a little uncomfortable with giving it to Miami-Dade Animal Services because their website states that they can euthanize cats/dogs 5 days after entering their care. 

I'm pretty sure the kitten doesn't belong to anyone. Most people in my complex let their cats roam outside without neutering them and the kitten doesn't seem to be very socialized. 

Any suggestions? 

The kitten is male, and appears to be an American Short Hair with a Mackerel Tabby coat. 

EDIT: Pictures by request.

UPDATE: Hey guys, just an update on the kitten's status. We nursed it for a couple of days but we really couldn't keep it for any longer. My roommate brought it to Miami-Dade Animal Services after calling a few more places who all said they weren't accepting any cats at the time. We posted on our Facebooks, here, and talked with our family, friends, and co-workers to no avail. At first, we were really uncomfortable leaving the kitten there but upon bringing it in many people waiting in the lobby were interested in adopting it.

Now she is ill with cancer and she asked us we think this place might still exist, so this is what I know: 

The restaurant building was made of corrugated iron, the drinks were served in recycled glass containers, you could have a great dinner and after the dinner you could dance. 
She was there in 1975 and she thinks the place was ""cult"" already back then. 

Do anyone know this place? Does it still exist? What is the name?

EDIT: Apparently this place is suppose to be ""just across the bridge"" from Ivanhoe hotell. That hotell seems to be long gone though.",,False,,t5_2qi76,True,,,True,t3_i5knd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/i5knd/please_help_whats_the_name_of_this_awesome_70s/,
