Read this,572,80,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/16wjvq/anyone_looking_for_an_ebooktextbook_read_this/,"There have been countless threads started recently in /r/trackers, /r/piracy and /r/Torrents by people looking of ebooks/textbooks for college..

&gt;Anybody looking for an ebook/textbook.. if you cannot find an ebook by: 
&gt;
&gt;1) Searching on **Google** (search for the name of the book and 'download' and/or 'epub' - 
'.epub' or 'pdf' - '.pdf' or 'torrent') 
&gt;
&gt;* Here is an example of this process &gt; [google.com/search?q=american+desperado+download+epub](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=american+desperado+download+epub)
&gt;
&gt;2) Searching on **Bookos.org** ([bookos.org](http://bookos.org/))
&gt;
&gt;* Here is an example of this process &gt; [bookos.org/s/?q=American+Desperado&amp;t=0](http://bookos.org/s/?q=American+Desperado&amp;t=0)

Here is some advice.",343,61,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/xtsal/with_the_demise_of_demonoid_many_of_you_folks/,"The loss of demonoid stirred up the public tracker world, and from what I've seen, many of you guys are at a loss of content, from comics and ebooks to movies and TV.  This is not the end of the world, but there are some things you should know about getting access to content elsewhere.  

Many of you think private trackers are just full of douchebag members that think their e-peens are huge from being ""1337"" enough to be in a closed little circlejerk club.  If that's the case, don't bother reading the post.

For the rest of you interested, you should know a few things about private trackers before trying to get into any.

Most members of private trackers are strong advocates for the technological movement of digital filesharing.  They find more pleasure in giving than they do receiving.  Members of private trackers work very hard for their ratios, user status, and membership.  Demonoid was nice because it was a wealth of content with no pressure to maintain access to the torrents.  It's gone now, and if you want to move on, the rules for you have changed (unless, of course, you are still happy with TPB and KAT, which is fine.)  Most importantly, members of private trackers **want you to be part of the community,** but only if you are willing to work and give more than you receive.  So how do you prove to be valuable members of the community?

First read these posts:

[This gentleman got screwed from reddit randoms he invited](http://www.reddit.com/r/Invites/comments/xslx5/be_careful_here_ive_been_banned_from_digital_hive/)

[Here is a list of open private trackers.  Please note, some have closed since the original post, but many are still open](http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/xdgmq/a_list_for_those_of_you_greatly_affected_by_the/)

[Here is a list of ebook advice taken straight from the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44)

As if inviters over reddit were not skeptical enough, now they are going to be super cautious about sending invites over public mediums with the loss of demonoid.  Are you screwed on comics?  ComicBT is the tracker for you!  They are any comic reader's wet dream.  ""Can I get an invite?""  Nope, because asking for invites in reddit threads is terrible form.  Also, nobody knows your sharing habits.  There are two places for invites: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/invites) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/x415a/what_time_is_it_new_consolidated_invite_thread/?sort=new)

""Sweet, so let's start invite requesting!  Ex-demonoid user here, dying for my movie fix.  IPT or PTP invite please and thank you!""  Well, PTP is on the no movement list, so not only is your post going to be removed, but inviters just notice some things about you:

1. You didn't read the ""no movement rules"" about the thread, so why should I trust you to read the rules of the tracker?

2. Ex-demonoid user? Okay, I can assume you don't have any ratio proofs to show me your sharing habits.

My suggestion is to check out all of the open trackers on the list provided above.  Again, the rules have changed for you, so you have to start over.  No more mentality of ""getting whatever I want for free.""  Those days are over, and it's time to shift towards the mentality of ""open, easy access to everything for everyone.""  It's time to share.  If you are patient and practice good sharing techniques on some open private trackers, the rest will come.

There is also the suggestion of what.cd (interview is in the sidebar).  If you think you are up to it, study and take the interview.  But your ass better share in their, and it's tough.  Seeding will only get you half-way.  You are going to have to provide your own content, and even then, the term *patience* never had a greater importance.  Everything you think you know about ""ratio"" and ""seeding"" on demonoid is meaningless when compared to private trackers.

Best of luck to all, I hope this helps at least a few.  The fall of demonoid sucks, but there are alternatives.  Remember to read the rules everywhere, reddit, trackers, etc.  Remember that membership is a privilege, not a right, and nobody ""deserves"" an invite or membership.

And inviters?  Be very very careful, not just for your sake, but for the sake of the tracker.  You have way more power in the tracker than you think, simply because of your invites.  Be smart, and never feel obligated to send an invite.  I've been careless with invites before, and got proper fucked because of it. 

**Edit**:  also, check out /r/baconbits.  Good community, good content, and a great starter

**Edit 2**: For those of you that have slow speeds, the list I provided has a few ratio-less trackers that only care about the cumulative seeding time.  The tracker closest to demonoid that is ratio-less is rutracker (use google chrome + translate plugin)

For those of you that want to stay ratio *and* seedtime worry free, torrentshack is currently open for registration, no ratio or seedtime rules, delete torrent history after two days, and have a friendly community.  If you sign up there, please remember that while you are not obligated to seed, it is courteous to do so for as long as you can.  Again, sharing is key, and somebody was willing to stay seeding for you.

**Edit 3:** Many of you fear private trackers due to your ISP putting a cap on your traffic.  **Seedboxes** are cheap, and many offer unlimited traffic.  In the short, dumbed down explanation, think of a seedbox like this - I download all of your torrents and seed 24/7, and transfer all of the data over an encrypted channel to your computer, all for 12+ bucks a month.  If you want a personal recommendation, I'd say go with bytesized-hosting.  Great plans for the buck, but you should always shop around.

Several years ago I retired from the piracy scene, but the knowledge I gained during my time spent there is still fresh in my memory. I started out as a courier for some shitty FTP's that had ties to FXP boards and thanks to my coding skills I eventually found my way onto some of the best (at the time) sites and nukenets within the piracy scene. I even had my own release group at one point.

One of the unique things I'm willing to admit is that during the last few years of my time spent in the piracy scene I helped fund my operations by supplying private torrent trackers with scene releases. This sort of thing is severely frowned apon within the scene.

This is an AMAA (almost anything) for obvious reasons. I'll begin answering questions within an hour of this post.

**Edit:** This has been fun, but I have a date with a fine young lady in an hour and I need to get ready. Thanks for all your questions!

**Edit 2:** Proof for the scene bitches, username redacted: &lt;+c&gt; I'm really intrested as to who he was here if he was even here, it's not that hard to pick up a nukenet name and say yeah... I was there totally

To give you an idea of how rare it is, it was only screened twice at film festivals in 2002. Disney then forbade its release and ordered copies of it destroyed. It's so hard to get a hold of that a Disney representative had to accompany a copy at all times during a rare screening at Pixar:

&gt; It seems that -- in mid-2002 -- the folks at Pixar Animation Studio wanted to hold a screening of ""The Sweatbox"" for all of the employees working at their Emeryville, CA. studio. So -- after a little negotiation -- Disney agreed to send a copy of the film up to Pixar ... provided that the print was always accompanied by a Disney studio representative.

&gt; And when I say ""always,"" I mean ""ALWAYS."" The story that I hear is that ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Docter actually offered to take the print's guardian down to Cafe Luxo for a quick bite to eat. The Disney studio representative refused, allegedly saying: ""If I ever let this copy of 'The Sweatbox' out of my sight, it could wind up costing me my job.""

So you can see how shocking it is that, two days ago, a 480p version was uploaded to YouTube. It far surpasses the quality of the previous bootlegged version, and is a direct transfer from a master VHS tape. It lasted two days and got 30,000 views before it was removed.

Re-uploading it to YouTube isn't an option, and with seizures of domains like MegaUpload, rampant anti-piracy measures at HotFile, RapidShare, etc., it'd only be a matter of time before it will be removed there. Fortunately, there's still a way for you to see it.

1. Download and install [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/). I2P is an anonymous network. It lets you browse a darknet and share information without corporations like Disney dictating what you can and can't see.

2. Once I2P is running, open ""I2P Snark,"" which is a BitTorrent client. You can do so by clicking ""Torrents.""

3. Paste the following magnet URL into the ""From URL"" box under ""Add Torrent.""  This will indicate to the network that you want to download *The Sweatbox*:

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97a76d8e0acb341cbb8811e50a367b197fa9a8f7&amp;tr=http://tracker2.postman.i2p/announce.php

[screenshot](http://s18.postimage.org/khfmhustz/tmpscreenshot.jpg)

(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can click ""Postman"" to access that I2P BitTorrent tracker. Search for ""The Sweatbox"" there, or check the recent torrents.

4. Click ""Add torrent"" and wait. The page will refresh and indicate when the file starts downloading. 

*Edit* Be sure to push start!

I2P will be much slower than the regular Internet as your traffic has to bounce around peers in order to make it anonymous. You can help make the file faster for others by seeding it. Just let your computer and I2P run even after the file has downloaded. 

There are other ways to share files, such as The Piratebay and private BitTorrent trackers. These aren't anonymous, and private trackers don't allow just anybody to share information. You have to belong to a special club. 

The value of this documentary is so high, however, and the content so compelling, that hopefully you won't mind learning how to use a new, cutting edge, open, and truly anonymous technology. One day you too might depend on the anonymity that I2P provides.

***TL;DR/why should I care?***

**Synopsis -- or, why animators think it's kick-ass that this documentary suddenly surfaced two days ago:**

Similar to ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Sweatbox"" offers a titillating glimpse into what it's like to work at an animation studio. Traditionally Disney has tried to present the appearance that their movies are created in a very flowing, gentile manner (in keeping of the spirit of the ""old men"" of animation, and Disney himself), and have suppressed information to the contrary. This documentary really paved the way to dispelling that smokescreen.

Basically if you like film making, animation, or wonder what it's like to work on a project where hundreds of people are literally pouring their hearts and souls into a project that (should something go wrong) could crash and burn tomorrow, you'll probably enjoy it. The film starts out with an animator whispering that the producers hated the first version, and they're all upstairs in a story room discussing six different pitches for the future of the movie. He admits that they might actually decide to kill the movie outright (which isn't unprecedented in animation studios), which would mean, literally, that hundreds of people would lose their jobs just like that. These are artists who pore their heart and soul into their work, and it shows. At some point they (accurately) talk about how getting a character cut from the script is very similar to the feeling of losing a part of your life. Something you've literally spent years creating suddenly being worthless and lost, as if it died

You also get to see plenty of pencil tests, storyboards, interviews with the creators, and brainstorming meetings. Including one where they basically call in the most respected names in animation to try and brainstorm a way to save ""The Kingdom of the Sun"", the then-name for ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

It also has an aura of mystery around it, because it's basically shocking that THIS movie, which has been so rare and hard to obtain, suddenly surfaced in excellent quality! It's satisfying that, after ten years of Disney suppressing the film to the point of requiring its representatives to literally not let it out of their sight, it suddenly surfaces.

&gt;AzzA tried to reroute the DNS for the domain and took the code/wiped the server (that's why BTN was down after AzzA was demoted) but alexj installed a backup and setup a new host (that's why they were asking for more donations).

So this was a hostile takeover by alexj and MarFlaming because they think AzzA is incompetent.  If you ask current staff they will say they were looking out for the best interests of the site and that BTN was being ran in to the ground.

We’re extremely happy to be here and able to welcome you back to your favorite games tracker! No doubt you have some burning questions on how this can be possible and the events leading up to our return; so let’s start:

Why’d you close, only to come back?
Two months ago we were in a position where we could not guarantee the ongoing safety of the staffers or members of the site. Rather than risk making that data accessible to some legal organization, we decided to shut down and fully give the impression we would never be returning (ha!). We’ve spent our downtime moving servers around and buffing up our security, as well as fixing lots of bugs and usability issues. The site and all your great work in terms of game descriptions and user contributions are 100% intact.

Really? All our stats?
All accounts are active again. You’ll of course not be subject to any hit n runs or inactivity disables that would have otherwise come into effect for not logging in/seeding whilst the tracker was offline. No torrents have been deleted for inactivity. Now what is important is we get back to seeding the existing torrents so all your hard work in the past doesn’t go to waste. To accommodate for the fact some users will have removed content, torrent inactivity deletions is disabled for the next month. There have been plenty of game releases in the last month that we need to catch up on, so there’re plenty of upload bytes opportunities – get uploading!

What about my stats? And didn’t you say you wiped the data?
All your stats, including torrents, seeding, forums, achievements, etc. have been fully restored. The plan was to wipe the data shortly after taking the site down, but the sysops immediately began talking about re-opening and decided to hold on to it for a little while should that happen. Rest assured, the data was handled with the respect your privacy deserves, fully encrypted and stored offline until a trustworthy host was established.

I’ve deleted files and now have/will get HnRs?
None of your current downloads will be processed as hit-n-runs for the next month. Re-download anything that will be classed as a hit-n-run due to lack of seedtime and resolve this before the month-long grace period expires. Anything you download from here on out though is subject to the rules.

Anything else change?
While we were down, we took the time to make a few fixes/improvements to the site. Most were around security, but some other back-end changes were also made to improve the site experience. If you look at the staff page you’ll notice that it more clearly shows which staffers cover which responsibilities, and who is in charge of each aspect of the site.

As a welcome back gift, everything is free leech for the next week. Enjoy!

All members can now log in with their account information!
Login and re-join the community!

P.S. If you can start reseeding your old stuff we'd be extremely grateful!",,False,,t5_2rjuw,1375032157.0,,tti,True,t3_1j81mq,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1j81mq/gazellegames_ggn_has_reopened/,

There is currently no system in place to reset your password. If you forgot it, then look through your password manager for your bG password or skip the import.

Since me and the other sysops at BTN, are big fans of Reddit, we thought we'd give back to you by offering unlimited invite codes to our interview system to anyone who wants one.

It's not an invite, but it's a chance to be interviewed by one of our staff which is pretty rare since all members only have 1 or two codes.

If you get a code, please fill out everything correctly and put proper profile links into where it's stated. If there's one thing we hate, its where users don't put in profile proof and we have to deny them for it!

So if you would like a code, Please PM either [Hex](/message/compose/?to=ethryx), [Marflaming](/message/compose/?to=marflaming), [Wheaties466](/message/compose/?to=Wheaties466), [ES](/message/compose/?to=OHAiTHARU), [stal1n](/message/compose/?to=b00n) or [KyleD2303](/message/compose/?to=KyleD2303) (mostly not AzzA because he's lazy like that :P)

NOTE: Please only PM one of us, if they don't reply within 24h, then you may PM another. If you are found PMing multiple staff, we will take it as you trying to get multiple codes which is against the rules.

Once you have recieved your code, goto http://btn-invites.net/ and enter it there.

(http://www.whatinterviewprep.com)

In the most recent announcement on the front page, WhatMan (founder) says the following:

&gt;Five years ago, I sat in my room, hacking away at those first few lines of code. Thousands of miles away, a couple of other programmers were sitting in their rooms, hacking away at the same codebase. One guy was figuring out how we could safely handle donations. A handful of people were helping others in the forums and on IRC, and another handful of people were moderating torrents and already starting to enforce our now famously strict quality standards. 
&gt;
&gt;We all had dreams of what we were creating. We shared them with each other, and while the details differed, the general theme did not. We wanted to create a quality place where quality people could come together and share music. Quality music.
&gt;
&gt;Little did we know, that dream would almost create itself.
&gt;
&gt;What.CD has always had quality people. Seeded with refugees from the greatest tracker of its age - OiNK’s Pink Palace - What.CD has never hurt for talented rippers, dedicated seeders, and a bustling community. Our forums are one of the most welcoming that I know of, we have an incredibly well curated music database, and a wiki filled with an absolutely ridiculous amount of information.
&gt;
&gt;The quality people couldn’t help but bring the quality music with them. Over a thousand torrents have been uploaded per day, every day since we opened. I always thought this would slow down once we hit some undetermined milestone, but after five years, the rate actually seems to be accelerating. We now have almost ten times as many torrents as we do users - and somehow, you guys manage to keep a collection of that size seeded. That’s goddamn astounding.
&gt;
&gt;In fact, the only difficult part of realizing our dream was making What.CD a quality place. It is unfortunately not enough to bring a bunch of amazing people together and hope for everlasting excellence - quality people demand quality surroundings, and we’ve always known that if our users don’t feel safe, welcome, challenged, and appreciated, they’ll find somewhere else to go. 
&gt;
&gt;It sounds so simple, but the key to making What.CD a quality place was keeping a quality staff. For five years, incredibly dedicated users have - for no discernible reason other than personal satisfaction - volunteered unhealthy amounts of their time and energy to making the site a quality place.
&gt;
&gt;I’ve been gone from the staff for a couple of years now, and whenever I pop back in, I see a lot of unfamiliar faces. But even though the people are different, the staff always feels the same - because what never changes is that all-pervading, almost fanatic devotion to quality. The torrent mods grind through hundreds of reports per day, to keep our music collection perfect. The community mods handle everyone from bad trolls to borderline stalkers, to make sure the forums and IRC remain a welcoming place. The cheater mods stare at tables of numbers for hours on end, to ensure that everybody plays fair. The badguy mods endure people lying to them for ridiculous amounts of time, on the off chance that one of them is telling the truth. The coders rewrote the entire site, continuously develop feature after feature, and keep an incredibly full-featured website running on a shoestring budget. The administrators keep all these teams united.
&gt;
&gt;We’ve had a lot of staff members come and go in the past five years, but they’ve all left their mark. Whether their contribution is drafting a rule, building a feature, banning a cheater, making a positive impression on a user, or doing one of the other hundreds of things the staff do to make What.CD great, this site is a quality place because it is the product of this vast number of positive contributions from many staff members.
&gt;
&gt;After I left, I watched from the sidelines when the sysop position was removed. I noticed that some users displayed a bit of skepticism. How could What.CD survive without the vision of one person steering it? 
&gt;
&gt;The truth is, What.CD never had the vision of one person steering it. What.CD has always been, and always will be, steered by the vision of a hundred and fifty thousand people and their collective devotion - towards a quality place, where quality people can come together and share music. Quality music.
&gt;
&gt;I’m damn proud of it, and I sincerely hope that every last one of you feel the same.",,False,,t5_2rjuw,False,,what,True,t3_12hjmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/12hjmc/whatcds_founder_gives_his_reflections_on_the_past/,

1354878049.0,88,self.trackers,14fthv,LibraryPirate is back,108,20,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/14fthv/librarypirate_is_back/,"LibraryPirate was a tracker dedicated to textbooks and academic journals that went down a couple months ago.

The tracker is now back online with a new site, but also with a brand new database... All previous torrents and accounts were lost. The site also appears to be a public tracker and doesn't require registration to download torrents.

Here is a forum post by teamcoltra that I found regarding the state of the new site:
&gt;Sorry that it's taken me a few days to get back to you, I have been spending most of my time focusing on building LP3 that I haven't had a chance to come by the forums. Let me start by apologizing for losing everything, it certainly was not my goal when everything happened -- I thought I had a backup but it wasn't working. The problem with the old system is that it was a closed source CMS that even I didn't have access to. 

&gt;* LP3 is an open website, anyone can use it now without being a member and without needing to be invited. To be able to view full descriptions of books, user who are not signed in will need to like the page on facebook or share the page on twitter. Registering gets rid of this requirement.

&gt;* We are working on a system which will reward users for seeding and such. Right now, if you look at your dashboard you will see an option to give us your IP address (or your seedbox's IP address) this will link your stats to your account. Though the system isn't perfect yet.

&gt;* There are no hit and run blocks, or any of those kinds of rules. Instead we have built an elaborate system which will allow our own servers to seed content until it has at least 3 seeders. Once we have 3 seeders we will let them provide the files to new people, and if we ever have less than 3 seeders our servers will kick in and start providing content again.

&gt;* We will be rewarding users who upload content primarily. Our focus is building up our library again and furthermore making it the largest collection of textbooks that you can find on a torrent site. Users who upload X number of textbooks (in the future) will be able to request their account be upgraded and we will let them download textbooks directly, without having to use torrents.

Hopefully the site will pick up. It used to be a pretty good source for books.

**Please do not continue to offer invites here, or else you may be putting your account at risk.**


Hey there. 

This is the official way to get invites to PTP in reddit. 

1: PM me 2 proofs of good ratio

2: include your email (hurr) (edit: INVITES TO HOTMAIL/LIVE ARE BEING MAGICALLY DELETED BY MSOFT, so don't use those addresses!)

3: ????

4: get downloading &amp; uploading!

I only check for messages, so unless you PM me I won't see it!

I have unlimited invites, but I can't guarantee this offer will last forever.

Also, I have a life so if I don't reply to your PM immediately please be patient.

That's about it. 

Jeeves.

Edit: Please, do not ask ""oh well here I am trying to get an invite do you still have some?"". This creates unnecessary traffic. If you qualify, you'll get one, so SEND EVERYTHING (EVEN THE EMAIL (omg)) AT THE SAME TIME. If there's a problem I'll let you know. Better than bouncing endless PMs. &lt;3

Edit 2: On your screenshots, please do try to include something more than a simple minuscule square box with a ratio. Try to include things like the tracker name (if allowed?), your username and the upload/download stats. The banner on top usually does the trick. Furthermore, if you add some extra customization (as some user did with the what.cd search bars) you'll make me laugh :D

Edit 3: Due to some torrent invite public forum publishing the fact, we've had quite a large number of people asking for invites that just registered to get the invites, so the reqs to get an invite have increased to reflect this.

Has this ever happened to you?

""I'm looking for a tracker that has this documentary I really want to see.""

""PTP will have it.""

""Oh, sweet, can I get an invite?""

""Read the rules. PTP is on the no invite list, which means invites can't be shared here, or on any public forum.""

If you are someone who has only been on public trackers like Demonoid or ISOhunt, or have chased down DDL sites like Megaupload (RIP) you might marvel at the mysterious world of top level private trackers. Well, wonder no more. I am someone who has gained access to some of the most exclusive trackers on the internet, including most of the ones on the N.M.L.-a member of BTN, PTP, SCC, RevolutionTT, STP, TC, and Bibliotik, and power user on What.CD (formerly elite) and IPT. Before being invited to What, I had used public trackers only, ever since I found BitTorrent in 2005. From Mininova to Btjunkie to ISOhunt...before settling on Demonoid (RIP). Through sheer luck, I got onto What a week before the US government took down Demonoid, and I never looked back.

Just showing off my e-peen, you say? No. Because today, I am going to teach you the insider secrets to not just get into the exclusive trackers, but to thrive and excel in then.

---

Let's start at step 1. You want to get into the top trackers, but you don't know where to start. Let me warn you that this might take a long time, if you have a slow upload speed and don't want to get a seedbox.

Option I: Btracs-&gt;sidebar offers-&gt;PU boards

Go to www.btracs.com and sign up for whichever trackers you wish-however you may want to stick with trackers in the ""closed most of the time"" list at the top. Then start seeding! Upload your own content if you can. Best to get two or more trackers. Then when your ratio is high enough (use your best judgment, but know that the 2GB free upload when you signed up and 15MB down with a ratio of like 350 won't count), PM one of the fine invite offerers in the sidebar. Then, make power user on that tracker and you will get access to the invites forum-most elite trackers will have invites pop up from time to time, and there may even be Staff/VIP/other unlimited invite offers. For example, BTN staff have a recruitment thread on Bitganer.

Alternatively, if the first tracker you signed up for has invites on a class restricted forum, you can get PU there and cut out the middleman. Depends on what's offered.

Option II: Baconbits -&gt; PU boards

Do you have 350 comment karma on a 6 month old account? Then you can interview for Baconbits. This is probably the easiest option for seasoned Redditors, and the selection is comparable to What.CD's invite forums.

Option III: What.CD interview -&gt; PU boards

To prep for the interview, go to www.whatinterviewprep.com. But be warned, its a tough interview, and you should be sharp on music formats, transcoding, the ratio rules and general torrenting. I failed three questions in. The bottom line: if you think you know enough, you should reread the prep information.

Also, even with a seedbox, its hard to get upload on What.CD. Tips:
1. Use better.php to transcode FLACs to MP3's

2. Peruse local libraries, record stores, your own collection of CDs, other general trackers, and if you can get invites, scene trackers

3. Fill requests-in the US, libraries are well integrated with Worldcat.org which you can use to search for requests

4. Jump on app releases early

5. Get all the freeleech torrents

6. Seed forever

7. What isn't just music. They have ebooks, comic books, standup comedy, audio books, music elearning videos, and apps.

8. Rutracker.org, TPB and Usenet have many 0day apps and FLACs.

Ratio:

* **Don't go nuts on downloading when you start!** This is important! Check your upload and download *very* carefully, and take it slow, or you'll end up on probation/ratio watch and possibly get your leeching privileges disabled, or even your whole account!

*  Review the ratio rules for each tracker

* Jump on new torrents or autosnatch if you can 

* Get all the freeleech torrents

* Watchout for sitewide freeleeches 

* Some trackers have, bonus points, half-leech and bonuses. Look out for those.

* Make sure you're connectible and you can seed 24/7-if not, try a seedbox.

* Read each tracker's wiki, knowledgebase, view the tutorials on the forums, or ask  the friendly people on the IRC channel-they will be glad to help you out.

*  darth_ephword recommends: You want to know what I do? Don't forget, if you download scene releases (the ones that are usually a lot of archive'd .rars), they're almost 100% the same torrent on every tracker (give or take maybe a text file). What that means is, you can download a scene release from one tracker, and just add the tracker from the site you want to seed on, to your torrent program. (with u-torrent it just asks you if you want to load the trackers, click yes, it verifies the files, adds it as a separate torrent to your list, re-downloads any inconsistencies, and will seed when completed). That's the best way I've got my ratio up on so many trackers, because you can download scene releases from public trackers, and seed them on private ones (just make sure you remove the public torrent/trackers/whatever from your torrent client when you're done downloading).


Option IV: Talk with people on IRC

Sometimes, the best way to get invites to other top trackers is by making friends in the IRC channel or forums of the early trackers you become a member on. This can save you time. But be discreet and save it for PM's.

It took me about six weeks of work, from being invited to What.CD to getting invites to all the trackers.

What makes a tracker a good tracker? It's a huge user base or a thriving community. elK is neither, but they like to pretend otherwise.

You might have read the antics the site admins have pulled of over the last few months: elK started as a ratioless music tracker, which was cool for those of us who did not want to bother with the hunt for invites or the elitist interviews. There wasn't a lot of activity back then (it hasn't changed since, don't worry) but it was good enough. Then the site implemented a ratio system overnight, and then switched back to ratioless. If we were to believe the admins, it was intentional to weed out the bad members, too bad there were hardly any members at all to begin with.

Now a mass message has been sent that links to the following:

&gt;For security reasons we will change the domain name to a new one and get more servers.In order to do that we will need of course more funds currently we have 290$ and we are missing 210$ so we can keep the current servers up and running too and pay for the new ones.If you have the power to support this community visit the donations page and choose the option that fits you.If everything is done don't forget to email us to [redacted]@gmail.com and include your transaction id,elk username and an email so we can send you the details to the new site.We know that not everyone can support us even if they wanted to so there's no need to worry just use the same email from above with a strong reason,your username from this site and email to get the details to.We have the right to reject you if your activity here was a poor one.A 500 user limit will be set to the new elk in order to avoid snitches that made us to take this hard decision!We love the site like most of you do but we have no other way...

tl;dr: beg for an invite to the new site or pay money, or you'll be left behind.

Given the propensity of the admins to revolutionize their site once a month, I'd stay away from it.

I haven't received any since. I happened to notice an email I needed, which I never deleted or opened, from a month or so ago was no longer in my inbox. The email contained IP information for some work I needed to do. I thought it was extremely strange that this email just disappeared, and checking my inbox, every email I've ever received with IPs in it has been deleted from my inbox. I never delete anything. Very, very strange.

I decided to do some more investigating and it turns out that any email I receive with an IP address in it is deleted from my inbox within a few minutes. Very, very, very strange at this point.

&gt;Getting to Know Your x264




x264 is a harsh mistress. Despite mostly being used to compress movies, it is for some reason highly optimized for anime tentacle porn. On top of that, there is no built-in gui for beginners and the available documentation seems only to exist so that it may taunt and humiliate the average person. Well fear not! Even though I haven't encoded anything for the site in probably over a year, I'm here to guide you through (most of) x264's meaningful parameters so you can become better at encoding. And as a bonus, writing this will keep the staff from demoting me to a userclass where the rest of you filthy swine reside. So, without further ado...



Ref

This is a no-brainer parameter that requires no testing but is critical for yielding the highest possible quality without breaking standalone device (Popcorn Hour, WDTV Live, Roku) playback. Taken directly from the HD encoding guide:

Once you have cropped your source in AvsPmod or whatever other script editor you are using, take the equation 8388608 / (width after cropping x height after cropping), inputting your source's width and height in what I hope are obvious enough placeholders. Take the result and round it down to the nearest whole number. This is the number you are to use for the --ref setting.


    If you use a number larger than what the formula yields for a 720p or 1080p encode, it will still play but will only look slightly better and will not play on standalone devices.
    If you are encoding to a Standard Definition resolution (i.e. smaller than 720p), you may skip the math and simply use 16 as your ref number.
    Keep in mind that by design, you cannot use a number larger than 16 here.




B-frames

B-frames have a fair amount of control over the compressibility (size) of your encode. More bframes = longer encoding time but also smaller file sizes. But you cannot exactly force more bframes into an encode if x264 decides it doesn't need them... well, not without using b-bias and catastrophically breaking things. Anyway, the ideal number of b-frames needed for an encode can be determined in a single test encode. And by 'single' I mean you'll need to use the avisynth filter SelectRangeEvery() to grab a few thousand frames to test using --bframes 16. x264 will spit out a log file when the test encode is done. Somewhere in this log will be a line that looks like this:


x264 [info]: consecutive B-frames: 0.5% 1.1% 3.6% 24.0% 14.4% 43.3% 4.0% 3.4% 1.1% 1.4% 0.5% 0.9% 0.3% 0.3% 0.2% 0.9% 0.1%


There are 17 values listed. Each one represents a specific number of b-frames, from 0 to 16. Each value shows the percentage of total frames that were able to make use of that number of consecutive b-frames. From these numbers I usually select the largest one ≥ 1.0% but have made exceptions for 0.9% values.



CRF and 2-Pass

Whether you choose to encode crf or 2-pass, this setting will have the most significant impact on your encode's overall quality. With 2-pass, you choose a bitrate. With crf you choose a quality level in the form of a numerical rate factor. The bitrate/quality will vary throughout the extent of whatever you are encoding, but will average out to whatever your input for this value was.

CRF and 2-pass use the exact same algorithm and therefore there is literally no advantage to using one over the other. If a crf 20 encode gives you an average bitrate of 6000 kbps, a 2-pass encode @ 6000 kbps will yield the exact same quality. Additionally, the log from the first pass of a 2-pass encode will give you the equivalent rate factor one would use for a crf encode.

Again, there is NO advantage to either method. Many people prefer 2-pass due to not fully understanding how to use the next setting I'll go over. Others will do test encodes with both crf and 2-pass to achieve ideal quality. My preference happens to be crf, but only because I feel that bitrate/filesize should be irrelevant and picture quality should never be compromised. Then again, everything I've ever encoded is like 400 GB...

Reasonable bitrates for 2-pass/crf will vary depending on your source and a few other settings. I can't say much on bitrate, but crf should nearly always be between 16 and 23.



QComp

While crf and 2-pass affect the overall quality of the encode, qcomp affects how crf and 2-pass are applied. Next to crf/2-pass it is the most important x264 parameter for afecting the quality of your final encode. qcomp will always be a number between 0.0 and 1.0. At 0.0, your crf number or 2-pass bitrate will yield a constant bitrate throughout the entire encode. At 1.0, the encode's bitrate variance is completely uncapped and so will flail around like a crack-addicted preschooler.

The default is 0.6 but for live-action should be bumped to 0.7, or 0.75 for sources with a lot of grain/noise. For lower quality sources with little or no grain, low-quality animation or dark movies without much grain you can try around 0.55 or 0.5. Essentially the viable qcomp range for any source will be (roughly) 0.45 - 0.75.

This is a setting where testing multiple values is definitely worth it.

If you have any feedback please let me know and I will edit it in.
 
**What is FTP**

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol used to transfer files between two servers on a tcp based network. When talking about torrents FTP is mainly
used in combination with seedboxes. You download the files via torrents on the server and connect with a FTP client to bring the files to your own pc. 

**What is SFTP**

SFTP, not be confused with FTPS which is FTP over SSL, is a different protocol that works on top of a encrypted SSH connection. Both the commands and data stream is fully encrypted. It's a totally different protocol though and only the name is similar to FTP. Since it works on top of TCP though the rest of the text still applies to SFTP. 

**FTP and speed**

Most of the questions regarding FTP have to deal with speeds issues. To explain why FTP does not always max out your home connection we have to take a look at the way
the transport layer FTP uses works. Like mentioned above FTP uses TCP as it's transport layer. TCP is a great protocol, it has built in error detection, it numbers the packages so it can rebuild the file regardless of the way the packets arrive and it has native support for flow control. Flow control is responsible for deciding how fast the server sends the data to the client and is main factor that decides your download speed. When talking to a server the client requesting the data specifies a ""receive window"" it's a value that decides how much data it is willing to receive before reporting back to the server that it received all the packages. If for instance it announces to the server it's willing to buffer 256kb of data the server will send 256kb and then wait for the client to report that it received the 256kb in good order. It's this mechanism that's responsible for the loss of speed. If you are very close to the server (let's say 12 ms) it's not that much of a problem. The server will send 256kb and then pause for 12ms. This won't really effect the speed. However if you live in the US and you are connecting to a server in Germany this trip might take 130ms. This means for every 256kb the server sends it waits 130ms to send the next 256kb. That's why you can max out your download to one server but get a sucky 150kb/s on a different one.

*tl;dr The further away you are from the server you are trying to download from the slower your download will be.*

**Introducing multi-thread and multi-segment**

Don't give up just yet! There are techniques that can drastically improve your download speed. Clients like FileZilla can connect with multiple threads to one server. The TCP limitations I just talked about are working on a per thread basis. So if you are only getting 150kb/s, you are actually getting 150kb/s per thread connected to the server. By increasing the thread count you will also multiple your speed. If your residential line can do 1500kb/s you should set up your client to download with 10 threads. Each thread would be limited to 150kb/s but the total speed would still come up to the 15000kb/s your line can handle. This is called multi-threading. Note that this does not scale indefinitely. If you are on a 50Mbit line and only getting 50kb/s per thread creating 120 threads probably won't improve your speed as much as you think since most servers only accept a limited amounts of connection per ip to prevent flooding. Multi-threading will work fine if you are downloading the latest Phish concert since each song is it's own file and FileZilla will make a new connection for each file. However when you download the latest Ubuntu 12.04 LTS release which is one large iso file FileZilla can only create one thread. This is where multi-segmenting comes in. (I'm not sure this is the correct term but it's the one I decided to use) Multi-segmenting clients, like CuteFTP Pro or Free Download Manager can take that one file and split it up in several small parts. For each part it will create a thread to the server so it can download that one file with 10 threads brining you close to the 1500kb/s limit again. 

*tl;dr Your speed is limited per thread, increasing your threads increases your speed. Use a multi-segmenting client so you can use multiple threads even one single file downloads.*

**The clients**

Here are a few client suggestions, on windows I am a big fan of Free Download Manager. It's sounds like scamware but it works really well and like the name implies, it's free.

* FileZilla, multi-platform, supports threads but not segmenting, Free, Open Source
* Free Download Manager, Windows, supports threads, supports segmenting, Free (duh), Open Source
* Cute FTP Pro, Windows / OS X, supports threads, supports segmenting, Paid
* lFTP, Linux / OS X, supports threads, supports segmenting, Free, Open Source
* Speed Download, OS X,supports threads,  supports segmenting, Paid
* BitKinex, Windows, supports threads, supports segementing, Free
* Captain FTP, OS X, supports threads, not sure about segmenting, Shareware
* SmartFTP, Windows, supports threads, supports segmenting, Paid
* Transmit, OS X, supports threads, does not supports segmenting, Shareware
* Cyberduck, OS X, donate-ware
* [Interarchy](http://nolobe.com/interarchy/), OS X, support threads

If all fails and you need to get a file without the option to install a client most browsers can handle FTP connections for you. Simply use an url in the following format: ftp://username:password@server.com.

For more client options see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/rsx9r/what_methods_do_you_use_to_pull_files_from_your/). A copy of this guide can be found in wiki format [here](http://wiki.bytesized-hosting.com/wiki/index.php/ByteSized_Boxes/FTP-Guide).

1371868385.0,68,self.trackers,1gu2rw,What is missing from current trackers feature wise that you would like to see implemented?,84,16,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1gu2rw/what_is_missing_from_current_trackers_feature/,"Long story short, I've been working on a tracker for the last few months and am looking for some innovative ideas from people to implement to make it really stand out.


I've created the complete stack of the core modules including the tracker itself, the web site, IRC bots, message queues, predb, etc. under a single code base. This makes everything very cohesive and easy to change or add new feature to. Its currently working at an alpha level with the core expected features one would expect from tbdev based trackers and some of the better features of gazelle (as a long time developer i cant use these horribly ugly code bases without wanting to punch babies).


**Current features i have implemented:**

* Standard boring stuff like news posting, profile editing, avatars, searching, uploading, invitations.
* Tracker with peer speed reporting capabilities, black/white lists for clients, leech multipliers.
* Responsive frontend which works quite well on mobile
* Metadata fetching for TV/Movies/Games with tvrage/imdb/gamesdb/etc. Still need to pull banners/posters, but otherwise working.
* Pretty graphs generated using d3 of various things like Role membership distribution, estimated overall site bandwidth use, etc. More to come.
* Flexible hierarchical role based access controls (NIST RBAC level 2), ACL is dead!
* Basic Forums and commenting system using markdown formatting with live editing previews.
* Customized RSS feeds based on show titles of your choosing. For example if you added breaking bad from tv-hd it would create a feed entry for those releases limiting the results to 1 entry per episode, unless propered. Think of it like server side RSS filters, you don't have to setup any filters on your torrent client.
* IRC: announcements for new uploads, pre spam, pre search, 
* List of alternate related torrents of the same episode / movie / game etc.
* IPv6 Tracker support
* All IP based information is stored in memory only, never written to disk. In the event of siezure by authorities all information related to users would be gone on power down.

**Added Jul 1:**

* Tracking of Actors &amp; Genres -&gt; show/movie relationships to allow for easily discovered new content.
* Web based predb
* Picking a name and domain
* Alternate .bit domain not subject to any governmental controls


**Features awaiting implementation.**

* Seeding bonuses for long term seeding. Potentially using some type of slow logarithmic based calculation going up as time goes on.
* A REST API. This would be more than just the usual read-only stuff that ive seen from api's like BTN. It would include things like the ability to upload.
* Same thing for Genres/Musicians -&gt; Bands
* Genre/Developers/Publishers -&gt; games
* Automated subtitles retrieval for tv/movies
* Invite graph trees + stats. See your children grow :)
* ""Paranoia Levels"" similar to BTN
* Befriending support
* Alternate CSS themes. Its all built around SASS so creating new themes is very easy, can do competitions like others possibly.
* Some type of indication for torrents that you have already downloaded
* Request system with upload bounties, possibly even BTC based bounties.


**Potential features i have not decided on:**

* Have the tracker give some priority to seeders on lower speed links so that seedboxes don't make it too difficult for normies to seed. Possibly after 30 minutes or so of the torrent being active this would get triggered leaving a large pool of seeders still so it wouldn't hurt end user performance.
* Wiki similar to what, but forums and static html help pages are potentially good enough on their own.
* HTML5 Notifications over websocket transport for new releases posted. Could be filtered to just show things matching your defined filters.
* External notifications, for example when the tracker detects a completed torrent, send a email or POST to some server giving the details.
* UDP Tracker support
* Affiliate bonuses based on how well the people you invite do. However no punishments based on their performance.
* 2 Factor authentication
* Arcade with monthly/yearly high scores with rewards for top players.
* IRC Idling/activity bonus


I don't really see the point of specialized tv/movie/game trackers. Most that exist add very little value to warrant specialization. I plan on covering most features that are unique to their respective content types which mostly boils down to linking metadata between torrents, actors/publishers/developers/etc. This tracker is likely to include P2P content, however certain features may rely on the scenes conformity to work well, we'll see.

I've been in the game a long time now, 15+ years, doing things from coding FXP boards, racing, running, coding mostly gl based sites, and occasionally tools for release groups. I eventually moved to torrents 5-6 years ago after getting tired of the scenes elitist users and lack of progress, seriously, how fucking long did it take for FLAC to get accepted as a scene standard? 20Gb bluray no prob., 350mb flac release nope! Anyways, the most enjoyable experiences for me have always been places with a good community around them, so i certainly place a high value on features that help enable that.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

ps. ill throw a sizable upload credit to anyone who comes up with a good name + domain :)

Of course, you all know that the legal climate has changed over the years, so we won't bore you with that stuff. More importantly, the founders are simply ready to move on with their lives. Running an immensely popular gaming tracker is a rewarding, but it's also a very stressful, and often thankless, task.

**Some more information about Reddit Shadowbans:**

* [stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/03/09/silently-banned-reddit/](http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/03/09/silently-banned-reddit/)
* [reason-being.com/index.php/2012/09/15/shadowbanned-from-reddit/](http://reason-being.com/index.php/2012/09/15/shadowbanned-from-reddit/)
* [google.com/search?q=reddit+shadowban](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=reddit+shadowban)

I have created this temporary account to post this single thread, possibly some comments (in this thread only) and send some pm's (to past users who have reflected positively on my previous comments/threads)

I do not know if this thread will have any effect on any sort of eventual evaluation of my account and its shadowbanned-status *..but as its been 10 days with no response..* **I am pleading my case**

**IF YOU FEEL POSITIVELY (or negatively) ABOUT MY TIME HERE ON REDDIT..**

**PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT AND SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS :)**

I am well aware at first especially, much of my posting/commenting was viewed skeptically here on Reddit..  

..but I think over time this sort of a negative viewpoint towards my posts/comments has dissipated tremendously

* **EDIT:** I have created an html page for my ""comments"" from the past 2 months (800+).. 

* Because my account is shadowbanned, my profile page appears as ""404"" (file not found), therefore my comment-history cannot be viewed

* **My Comment History for the Past 2 Months &gt; [comments.htm](http://opentrackers.org/opentrackers_last_two_months/comments.htm)**

I am *also* well aware, that I participated in 'spam-like' activity.. 

ie: copy and pasting text

ie: posting my blogs url's repeatedly in comments

..however, both of these actions were only *ever* taken for 

**a)** time saving reasons 

..and **b)** because of the repetitive nature of the questions I am responding to.. 

ie: how do I find X torrent

ie: how do I find X ebook/textbook

ie: how do I get X invite etc etc

ie: what is the best tracker for X

ie: what is the best way to torrent safely

**..the best answer is a pre-formatted one**

I also kept the current and the old ""Open Sign-ups Thread'"" going a lot of the time (in the sidebar)

* Current &gt; [/19gcdz/open_signups_thread/?sort=new](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/19gcdz/open_signups_thread/?sort=new)

* Old &gt; [/yebm7/open_signups_thread/?sort=new](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/yebm7/open_signups_thread/?sort=new)

⁬I have NEVER posted a comment/thread on Reddit with the goal of ""spamming"" my blog..  

**My ONLY reason for posting here has *always* been to be helpful**

..considering I *only* posted in /r/trackers, /r/torrents and a few other piracy related subreddits.. 

*..I'd have to say this is clearly evident* &gt; **[screenshot](http://cdn.opentrackers.org/i/20130426082609341.png)**

This is also true for my blog.. 

The reason I started my blog (besides it and my Reddit account being pet-projects).. **..is to be helpful**

This being said, I have still been marked as a spammer.. and my account has ceased to work :(

I am appealing this ban (I have sent 2 messages to the Reddit Admins).. 

..however, as I said above.. *it's been 10 days with no response :/*

As its been this long with no response, I am resorting to the Public/Democratic Opinion of my fellow Redditors

If the reaction to this thread is overwhelmingly positive, I will send this thread to the Admins in another attempt to persuade them I am not a spammer

.. and hopefully.. the reaction *is* postive

**However.. if the reaction is negative in any substantial capacity.. I will resign perminately**

If this is the case.. It has been a fun past 5 months being a part of /r/trackers and /r/torrents..  

I have enjoyed being helpful and helping to spread Entertainment via Torrents and other forms of Piracy :)

Since the death of Demonoid, we've had a pretty big influx of users. This is just a reminder of the current rules.

* Trading invites is **STRICTLY** forbidden and will get both of your accounts disabled.
* You may only request/offer invites [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/x415a/what_time_is_it_new_consolidated_invite_thread/?sort=new). Please read the OP as there are a few trackers that are not allowed. (See also: /r/invites) 

(Please click report if you see anyone trading or requesting/offering invites outside of that post!)

* You can PM the members in the sidebar with at least **TWO** proofs of ratio. 
* Do not PM random users asking for invites.

As of Aug 23, IPT has implemented a new H&amp;R system that is very dependant on bonus points.  Pretty much all torrents that aren't seeded 1:1 will be marked as a h&amp;r until the end of the month, or until you spend 50-100 bonus points to remove it.  50-100 bonus points are obviously not hard to obtain, and they have even revamped the bonus system to make it match the h&amp;r rules appropriately.  

The long version can be found on IPTs home page.

I just wanted to remind everyone since IPT is a very requested tracker here.

I don't want to come off as an asshole to demonoid users, especially since there are a good many of you that are great sharers and have no problems with seeding.  But I have personally been screwed over on some trackers via h&amp;r's, poor ratios, etc, all committed by demonoid zealots.  Those folks do not understand that private sites do not operate with DHT, making seeding more difficult than the common public tracker.  After I invite them, 3 days later I get PMs asking why they aren't able to seed, as if it is something on their end.  That is an uneducated problem, and will hurt the tracker community as well as the inviter.  So before some demonoid users lash out at me, I'm sorry, but I've had very bad luck with you guys as a whole, and I *do* care more about the well being of the member/inviter and the tracker than I do about you getting a ""new home"" since demonoid went down, so please be understanding to my warning.

Lately I've been noticing a lot of posts of the type: ""Banned from siteX what do I do?"", ""disabled on siteY"", or ""is siteZ not working?"" 

Almost all of these types of post are ill suited for reddit IMHO.

If you are banned/disabled from a site, don't come to reddit, most of us here cannot help you. Your best bet is to get on the IRC channel that the tracker in question is a part of. Actual staff from the site can help you there, rather than random redditors here.

Along the same lines, instead of posting ""is when.dvd down for anyone else?"" goto when.dvds IRC channel. If they are down, users in IRC will definitely be aware. And often the current topic will have site status, from the website, to the tracker to any other systems they are running. If the site is down, they sometimes have a description of why it's down and an ETA of when they'll be back up. Also use downforeveryoneorjustme.com to see if the site is indeed offline!

Anyway just hoping we can cut down on these types of posts they are ill-suited for the reddit community at large, just my 2 cents.

TL;DR: check IRC before posting about site access/downtime",,False,,t5_2rjuw,False,,rutorrent,True,t3_teswp,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/teswp/regarding_many_of_the_recent_posts_about_people/,

***********


2010 has been a great year for r/trackers. We started out as a small community with the purpose of primarily posting news about the happenings in the world of private trackers, and with so many subreddits dedicated to bittorrent already existing, we did not expect it to take off like it has. I remember wtfreddit and myself sneakily luring in users in the beginning by replying with a link to our Demonoid invite thread whenever there were users looking for these in other communities. 

Today, with the generosity of several users who have offered their invites, the hard work of our moderators (except for my lazy ass) updating the sidebars and keeping unethical trading in check and most of all the solid camaraderie of our entire userbase, we are almost 4000 strong and have helped hundreds of redditors enter the world of private trackers. And all this, without the drama and scandals that go on in most other forums dedicated to private trackers.

If you have enjoyed this community, I hope you can take out time to vote for it in the BestOf2010 awards, and although we will almost definitely not win in any of the categories, it will at least help us gain some visibility and subscriptions and get more activity going in terms of invites, posts and comments.

There hit and run system is horrible to say it nicely. I understand the point of it since there are many people who leech and don't seed some torrents, but their implementation of it is disgraceful.

For example, if I get a freeleech torrent that is say 60GB, I have to seed that ENTIRE 60GB. No, ""Hey, you seeded it for 2 weeks, 50 years and there is still no one to leech it from you"" thing, nothing. Regardless of how long you seed it, if no one wants it, you are indeed fucked on that torrent. 

You can either spend 50 bonus points to make the Hit and Run go away which if you do the math is ridiculous, not to mention your mixing bonus points and hit and run points into one unit so it's really confusing or you can use 60GB upload credit..yea like I'm going to waste 60GB of upload to make this damn hit and run notice to go away.

Come on, I'm not a part of many private trackers, but I'm sure there are many that probably implement this hit and run system much better than this. At least say ""if you seed a torrent for X hours then it is no longer a hit a run"" and then tell us how long we have been seeding it in our control panel. 

Another problem I am facing is that I am using all of my seedbox space for these damn hit and runs. Since I pretty much have to seed them forever since no one is leeching them from me I have to keep them in my seedbox and then I don't have enough space to download other shit.

What's the point of a freeleech if I know I'm not going to be able to seed that much data back regardless of how long the torrent is in my seedbox? There's none, I'm just shooting myself in the foot.

If any of you have any idea how to make this better or have any other comments please chime in.

As you can tell, I'm getting very aggravate by it and I know that there are several others that are in the same boat.

Thanks!

1365868467.0,47,self.trackers,1c9u3g,My 2 cents: reviewing a few trackers I've been a member of.,68,21,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1c9u3g/my_2_cents_reviewing_a_few_trackers_ive_been_a/,"What's up /r/trackers,

Since I have too much free time on my hands, I've decided to give back to the community and write short reviews of the trackers I've come across during the last few years. Feel free to discuss, add your own reviews or downvote my dissenting opinions. Some of those reviews are written from memory though, so your mileage may vary.

Now on alphabetical order:


* Name: **Deviloid**

Category: porn, scene/p2p

Short description: Highly-organized and heavily-moderated porn tracker.

What I like: Lots of content, most of it pro western porn. Everything is kept in order.

What I don't like: No tag-based browsing.

Things to know:

Seed bonuses: yes

How can I join? Open signup


* Name: **Empornium**

Category: porn, scene/p2p

Short description: Probably one of the biggest porn trackers.

What I like: Lots of users, active community, lots of pro/amateur content. Well-maintained and moderated, tag-based navigation.

What I don't like: There's nothing to hate.

Things to know: Some people will probably say that ""this obscure invite-only tracker is better"" or ""that Russian one is superior"", but truth be told their content is probably already on Empornium.

Seed bonuses: yes, generous

How can I join? Open signup


* Name: **GFT**

Category: general, scene/p2p

Short description: Ratioless scene tracker that allows user uploads.

What I like: Features a lot of content and scene/p2p packs while being entirely ratioless.

What I don't like: They are always in need of donations and you will be reminded.

Things to know: Given how the tracker appears to be desperate for donations, it might not survive much longer.

Seed bonuses: yes, for invites only

How can I join? Invite only


* Name: **HD-T**

Category: HD content, scene/p2p

Short description: Huge tracker specialized in HD content. Music, movies, series, porn. Features excellent internal encode teams, as well as releases from other trackers' internal teams.

What I like: Lots of content, homemade releases are of top notch quality.

What I don't like: They have a weird rule that makes them remove a scene release's torrent once they have posted their own internal encodes. Also, porn is not counted when computing your ratio. 

Things to know: There is a 15GB download quarterly quota. If you don't meet it, your account will be pruned.

Seed bonuses: yes

How can I join? Invite or the occasional open signup, usually after the quarterly accounts purge.

* Name: **Pisexy**

Category: general, scene/p2p

Short description: General scene/p2p tracker that allows user uploads. Used to be active, but is dying now.

What I like: Struggling to find something to write on this one.

What I don't like: The site is pretty much dead. Also, this quote from the Browse page: *Every time you think something or someone is stupid, It just means there is another thing in this world you don't understand.* I understand the quote, and it is stupid.

Things to know: Might die eventually?

Seed bonuses: no

How can I join? Invite only


* Name: **Pussytorrents**

Category: porn, scene

Short description: It is TL's sister site, dedicated to scene porn.

What I like: Clean design, provides screenshots, and is rather active.

What I don't like: Just like TL, has wait times and torrent limits for new users. Does not leak all the scene releases that could be available and is thus missing tons of content.

Things to know:

Seed bonuses: no

How can I join? Open sign up

* Name: **SCC**

Category: general, scene

Short description: Probably one the best scene trackers available.

What I like: Fast pretimes and swarms, excellent site design, so much content, freeleech sections (music, packs, foreign releases) to built a ratio.

What I don't like: Some of their users probably masturbate to SCC's pretimes or to their ratios.

Things to know: The community is fast, very fast. Most of the members use an auto-dl of some sort on their seedboxes, which means that if you are 5 minutes late to the party, you may not find someone to seed to.

Seed bonuses: no

How can I join? Invite only

* Name: **SceneBits**

Category: general, scene

Short description: New scene tracker, promising but riddled with issues.

What I like: General scene tracker where it is easy to maintain a good ratio, clean design, well maintained code.

What I don't like: Their autobot is often offline, denying the site of any new content.

Things to know: Will it survive for long? Not sure.

Seed bonuses: yes, generous

How can I join? Open signup

* Name: **TD**

Category: scene, general

Short description: Extremely old scene tracker that went offline a few months ago and resurrected with a fresh user base and code. If you were a member, you should be able to recover your account (but not your stats).

What I like: well-maintained, clean design, 

What I don't like: not as active as it used to be, unfortunately

Things to know: It should be a good tracker again once the admins get it up and running for good.

Seed bonuses: not yet

How can I join? Should still be open signup

* Name: **TL**

Category: general, scene with a bit of P2P

Short description: One of the biggest, most active scene trackers. Easy to join as well since invites are plentiful. No porn.

What I like: Tons of contents, lots of packs, active community. All the torrents are active even months after they are posted.

What I don't like: Has wait times and torrent limits for new users, probably a ploy to get them to buy VIP packages. The community is also a bit noobish. They also have an official Facebook page, on which you can go and beg for invites.

Things to know: Despite all of this, it remains an excellent scene tracker.

Seed bonuses:  no

How can I join? Invite only

* Name: **TBy**

Category: general, scene

Short description: One of the oldest scene trackers (opened in 2004).

What I like: clean design, somewhat active community, lots of freeleech packs and content in general.

What I don't like: Pretimes are often lagging, torrents are deleted after 42 days.

Things to know: Built on the ashes of TorrentBits, it is amazing that the tracker has managed to stay in business for so long.

Seed bonuses: no

How can I join? Spam the signup page as accounts are pruned all the time.

* Name: **UG**

Category: gaming, P2P

Short description: Torrent tracker dedicated to games and gaming-related content.

What I like: Active and enthusiastic community with access to the most obscure content, freeleech torrents.

What I don't like: Nothing really.

Things to know:

Seed bonuses: no

How can I join? Invite only

* Name: **Webop**

Category: porn, scene/P2P

Short description: Built on the code of the now-defunct Cheggit. Features mostly pro porn.

What I like: Tag-based browsing.

What I don't like: Design is meh and the site still hasn't picked up with the Cheggit days. I hope that will change.

Things to know: While Cheggit's code was moved to Webop, its community clearly migrated to Empornium.

Seed bonuses: no

But what it *was* good for was old/obscure stuff. I could search for something old/obscure and find a torrent uploaded 2 years ago with 1 or 2 seeders.

[500 Invites Available],63,19,274,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1alu7m/ptns_5th_birthday_500_invites_available/,"~~PTN is a ratioless movie tracker, and we celebrated our fifth birthday on March 19th by offering 500 invites to reddit users.~~
~~Unfortunately 500 invites is not a small task, there are so many PM's and replies that this event could not be contained into just 1 day.~~

~~So i decided to refresh this post to update the thoughts of PTN staff.~~

~~As a small movie community we do not wish to grow too quickly, that being said, we realize that by increasing our user base we can improve our tracker with better retention of older movies so that we can serve our members everything they want.~~
~~We currently have very nice pre times on new movies, without cumbersome rar files, and have implemented a bonus system (which we are working to improve) that should allow movie retention to remain adamant.~~


~~This endeavour to gain more quality members that wish to use the site for all their movie needs is the first gesture of friendship to the reddit community, and we are enjoying it as much as the majority of you are. After this recruitment round we will evaluate the success of this venture, and if the total outcome is positive, you can be certain that we will offer future opportunities for the masses to gain membership.~~

~~If you are interested, please take the time to post in this thread why you are interested **(IF YOU POST NOTHING IN THE THREAD, YOU MUST GIVE A REASON WHY YOU WANT TO JOIN, IN YOUR PM.)**... and then PM me your email address.~~

~~A few points that i would like to make clear though...~~

~~PtN is ratioless, this does not mean you are allowed to download without seeding back at all. We are friendly and forgiving, but all things have their limits.~~

~~Attempts to create dupe accounts will result in all accounts involved being disabled permanently.~~

~~Friendly and fun loving IRC and forum users are welcome/preferred. (We have a lot of great people using the site... And it is nice to chat and joke with people that have the same interests that we do.)~~

~~If you have a slow connection... that is fine, we do not mind that at all. But we do have very reasonable seeding time rules.~~
~~We do not tolerate Hit and Runs.~~

~~There is new stuff being added all the time and we love taking comments and suggestions for improving the site. We are here for YOU (the members), if you aren't happy we're doing something wrong.~~


~~**Now i would like to make a few BOLD points.**~~

~~**The 500 invites will continue to be given out until they are all gone.**~~
~~**If you have not received your invite... please be patient. You have my apologies for any delay.** (I am getting to every PM as soon as i can.)~~


~~* **In regards to using a vpn, we only disallow a vpn for browsing the site and we pretty much always approve it as long as it's not a dynamic vpn solution you are using. I highly doubt the 6 strikes law involves the sites you're browsing. They are trying to catch people filesharing... not browsing.**~~

~~**Static IP VPN = Ok for browsing the site. NO VPN services with changing IP's**~~

~~**Dynamic IP VPN = Ok for seeding.**~~

~~* **If you have any other private tracker accounts... please include a link to those accounts and your email when you PM me. DO NOT PM ME JUST YOUR EMAIL! I want you to tell me why you want to join PTN, either in this thread or in the PM.**~~

~~* **AND PLEASE STOP SENDING ME PICTURES! PICTURES WILL BE IGNORED. WHEN I SAY LINKS I MEAN TO YOUR ACCOUNTS... NOT TO PICTURES.**~~


~~As a little personal note.... i am not a fan of our default theme or category icons. I suggest you change them after you join =D~~

Im hoping to get a seedbox going for my private trackers but literally dont have any idea what im doing. I mean full retard status. 

Im a mac user with absolutely no time (until now) to devote to my trackers, even though i maintain very, very good ratios (2+ is good for me). Until now, I have built those ratios through my normal IP but would really like to start protecting myself properly. I do not mind paying for seedbox use(obviously), but dont even know where to start in setting it all up. 

Problem is, as much as i read about seedboxes, vpns, ftp and whatnot, I have no idea what it all really means at the end of the day. I've read articles like [this](http://filesharefreak.com/2012/05/10/seedbox-from-scratch-setting-up-your-very-first-server) but its still over my head, as sad as that is. Like i said, I havent had the time to devote yet.

Now, I'm nearly 100% sure I'm connectible. I successfully seed TVTorrents just fine, and I've managed to seed what.cd in the past, but most of the time the completed torrents just sit in my list in the 'seeding' state but never connecting to any body.

I've started out with a very basic site built upon Django 1.5.1 (python) which is the latest version currently. It has the ability out of the box to support many databases and also has a rock solid caching system so it can handle growth from a few users to something about the size of reddit itself.

What i'm looking for from the community is.

Programmers:

 * Review/correct/contribute code for the good of everyone.

General Public: 

 * Contribute about what you want as part of a torrent site.

 * What are your gripes about current trackers?

Artists:

 * I'd love to see what cool logo's people can come up with.

Code: https://github.com/forked-tongue-dev/forked-tongue

Docs: &lt;tba&gt;

Offering the same as what I was looking to try and provide at much better progression and quality than I could ever hope to acheive on my own.

Spread the word - Posted 2012-02-28

We're very sorry for putting up a shutdown notice a few days ago. Our apologies to our entire crew of members who were saddened (and angry) at the sudden news, as well as the staff that were caught unawares.

At this moment in time we can't give any details about what happened, but something got us rattled last week. We made a snap decision to shutdown.

The wording of the shutdown message was poorly thought out. In retrospect, we should have waited a few days and put up this notice of a temporary downtime. We all felt really bad about it the day after.

Now the hard work is over and we're ready to announce our plans:

The Bibliotik.org website is secure and intact. We are searching for a new datacenter. If you have experience with good (or bad) datacenters, we would very much appreciate any suggestions. Send an email to biblogistik@i2pmail.org. For secure communication, you can encrypt using our public GPG key at the bottom of this page.

Additionally, our coding staff have some modifications to attend to. Feel free to stop by our IRC chat channel (#bibliotik) at irc.brokensphere.net and express your support for their hard work.

We'll keep this page updated with our progress.

Just to let you know this has been my go to place forever (10 years now), there has never been something I couldn't find, or get within a few days of a request

EDIT2!! **MAC USERS** go ahead and use http://shakespeer.bzero.se/ if my mod tells me otherwise, I will edit  
  
NINJAEDIT:  To clarify, this hub's original intent and still main purpose is to feed the addiction for audiobooks. The hub **requires** a minimum of 5gb of audiobooks in your shares. There is a bot that autochecks your hash and settings when you try to connect, it will boot you with an error if you do not meet the hub requirements and give you an error showing where your problem is. THAT BEING SAID, we have a TON of ebooks and other media as well, the users have been making it a habit that when they grab a book they grab not only the audio of it, but the ebook (mobi or epub) versions as well. NOTE: a boot is not a ban, it will just give you a connection error until you fix it!    
  
  
EDIT3: Okay guys I work early on fri-sat so I'm exhausted and going to bed. I will be back to fulfill more requests tomorrow after I get home from work (5pm PST- ish) sorry for the delay. But I will resume answering q's and responding to the PM's then!

1298774204.0,39,self.trackers,fthja,A Simple Guide To A Better Ratio,50,11,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/fthja/a_simple_guide_to_a_better_ratio/,"A good tracker requires you to upload what you download. This guide explains many of the methods involved with keeping on top of this sometimes difficult task.

*************

&gt;&gt;**Get On A Torrent Early**

Once a torrent has a ratio of more seeders to leechers it can often be difficult to get a decent upload speed. Going through your trackers recently uploaded list, try to find a torrent that has a high number of initial leechers (or possibly one that could be popular), start downloading and you should be uploading instantly. This method is generally more effective with a fast internet connection or [Seedbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox) as with a slower connection you may not be able to upload a substantial amount before it has an abundance of seeders.^1


&gt;&gt;**Port Forward**

Port forwarding is key to enabling other users to connect to you in order for you to upload. By forwarding ports you give easier access to the data that you have downloaded and connects you to your peers.
[Portforwarding](http://portforward.com/) is a simple process, but varies depending on your computers and routers settings. Suggested ports range from 49152-65534 to bypass program conflicts and remember to change your torrent clients configuration to the forwarded port.


&gt;&gt;**Cross Seeding**

Cross Seeding involves re-seeding already downloaded data. By either downloading an *identical* file from another source (i.e. a tracker that you already have a high ratio on) or obtaining it locally you can use already obtained data to seed to another *identical* torrent which only tracks upload bandwidth as nothing was effectively 'downloaded'.^2


&gt;&gt;**Get A Seedbox**

A Seedbox is a private dedicated server which is used for downloading and uploading data, using a remote torrent client. Seedbox's work by downloading and uploading the data on their own servers, generally at speeds of 100Mbit/s or higher. By using Seedbox's in conjunction with early torrenting, the data will be downloaded at high-end speeds and uploaded tenfold. Data is then stored on the servers which can then be downloaded through an FTP server.^3

&gt;&gt;**Check Your Torrents Rules**

Getting a decent ratio isn't always hard or bandwidth consuming. By checking your trackers rules, you may find that some have a 'timing' rule. What this means is by staying on a torrent and attempting to seed you will after a certain amount of time be given the remaining upload data just for the dedication of staying on the torrent. Most high-end trackers have this or a similar feature so update yourself on the rules.


&gt;&gt;**Throttle**

Throttling is the means in which you change the configuration of your torrent client to only download at the same speed you upload. This guarantees a ratio of greater than one is kept, but is only recommended if a decent internet connection is available or you are at risk of having your account disabled.


&gt;&gt;**Partial Downloading**

Partial downloading consists of downloading only a certain number of files from a multi-file torrent and uploading. By changing the priorities on the files located within a torrent, specified downloads can be 'skipped'. Doing so, only minimal amounts are downloaded and uploading is prioritized.^4


&gt;&gt;**Freeleech**

Freeleech torrents can be found on most trackers. A torrent (or in cases entire sites) may be specified as 'freeleech' for a certain time, occasionally permanently, and any data downloaded does not count towards usage, but uploading does.

****************
.^1 This won't work if your tracker has ""wait times"" where new users are forced to wait a certain time before they're allowed to download files

.^2 Always check your trackers rules, some forbid this method. Also, *identical* is key here, if it's not the same it won't be recognized and you won't be able to upload.

.^3  [Extensive list of Seedbox providers.](https://spreadsheets.google.com/lv?key=t2BX8hMu6bCQOC8QSu3UM9w&amp;f=true&amp;gid=0)

.^4 Be sure to check your torrents rules, as this method can get you a warning or your account disabled.

As some of you may already know or have discovered Supertorrents is currently down. After some long negotiation and talks, the owner of ST has decided to part ways from the tracker community altogether. Out of respect for him as the owner of this site, we have decided we will not continue on as Supertorrents; rather develop a new name, theme, etc. All user accounts will remain, along with the contents of the site including: torrents, forum posts, user stats, etc. 

This is NOT to be considered a hostile take over of any kind, rather a mutual decision among parties to respectful part ways and hence forth re-brand what was once ST as something new. We will remain a general tracker and all information that existed on ST upon its downtime will exist again once re-opened as its new and improved site. 

We do not currently have an ETA as to it's re-opening. However we will do our best to keep you informed as much as possible. Expect at least a few days of downtime as this was rather unexpected. 


We hope all of the current and future users of what is now formerly known as Supertorrents will be patient and continue with us as we begin a new journey!


Thanks so much for all you have done and continue to do,

0) I am editing and improving this following the comments people make, please forgive any delays in my doing so.

1)Q. What is a private tracker?
A. One that requires registration and membership. If you are lucky, it is 
open signup when you apply, more usually it requires application, interview or an invitation. Membership requires following some kind of rules of use. There are two main kinds of private tracker, one that specialises in a particular type of content (e.g. e-books, movies, TV, music) and one that share stuff as it becomes available on a daily basis (often called 0day/ scene). incidentally, reddit's own tracker, baconbits, is more eclectic and doesn't quite fit either....

Note: demonoid counts as public, not private, for practical purposes.

2) Q. Why join private trackers?
A. i) The risk of getting pursued by anti-pirates in any way is much lower than with public trackers- I'm going to go into this in more detail: para 7

ii) Their content is curated by volunteer staff very like a library- quality and availability will both be monitored, and you can request stuff that has lapsed or was never there.

iii) By definition there will be a community about the type of content the tracker has. Those people will help you find rare stuff and sort out technical issues, and in time you will do the same for others.

3) Q: How do I get in?
A: Pick one or more that interest you and that have open signup. The sidebar in this sub-reddit always lists some that are recruiting or have open signup. Get involved. Typically, anyone who makes 'power user' on a forum or who is active in the community has no trouble getting invites to other trackers. Power users typically have their own forums with invite threads- think of it this way, all a tracker wants to know is that you're gonna be a good member. Bad members make lots of work for unpaid staff. If you made it to power user somewhere, that's a good start. So don't get too hung up on ratio proofs and stuff for total strangers, far better to e-know some fellow members more organically.

4) Q. How do I survive and be a good member on a private tracker?
A. 
i) read the rules and see what you have to do, even though some of the rules will be obvious and boring.
All trackers tweak the basic idea of sharing to suit what they want- you might have to seed a torrent for a certain number of hours, or keep a certain ratio (of upload to download) overall, or log in every X weeks, or all of these.... 
A comment below has flagged this last one- even if you are seeding torrents, the rules may require you actually to log in to the tracker's website every so often.

ii) read any relevant forum threads and FAQs which help new members. Every site has a way of helping new members to survive. The tracker's website may also call this wiki, or knowledge base. 

iii) In general, seed stuff for a long time, seed stuff you already have from elsewhere but exists as torrents on your private tracker, upload new stuff if you can (check naming rules, they are always awkward).

iv) If you are used to public trackers and demonoid, be careful - on those, most people hit and run. So if you seed at all, you see a big positive ratio (ratio of upload to download). On private trackers, older content may not see any traffic for weeks or even months on end. Beware the idea of grabbing everything you want straight off.

v) no harm in being involved in the community through forums and IRC.

vi) A comment below has flagged that often the first and easiest way to progress is to find torrents that are freeleech (download is now counted, upload is) and concentrate on those.

vii) the best and purest way to get upload credit is of course to upload it yourself.

5) Q. Do I need a seedbox?
A. No. Though seedboxes and very fast home connections make things easy for you, all trackers have ways in which they even things up- bonus points, rare content (stuff in seedboxes tends to get recycled, as one is paying for the bandwidth and storage) , rewards for uploaders, periods of or individual torrents (often the biggest ones) that are freeleech. Sometimes freeleech torrents last for a certain amount of time e.g. new uploads for X hours or days, or 'special of the week' or are a certain category (e.g. above a certain size, a certain genre)
If you want to find out more about seedboxes, there is a sub-reddit devoted to that r/seedboxes. 

6) Any particular trackers I should know about? Here I'm principally going to incorporate what members are mentioning in comments.
Baconbits - Reddit's own private tracker, quite eclectic, link in the sidebar here. Good way of understanding how private trackers work in a friendly and accessible way.
what.cd - A mtusic tracker with an enormous amount of material. You may try to join through IRC interview; link in sidebar, or http://mjs.me/bm - be warned, though, it is hard to maintain ratio on this tracker simply because it has so much content and demand for music is so varied (e.g. compare the fact that it's easy to find out what the most popular TV shows are, and most demand is for the latest episodes of those shows). Since what.cd is a very demanding tracker, being power user there is a very good way of getting invites easily to other trackers. Some people however feel you should be experienced before you join what, since most other trackers are easier to do well on.

7) Security issues - why are private trackers safer than public ones?
a) strictly speaking there is no reason why anti-pirates should not go after pirates in private trackers just as much as in public ones. They have just the same opportunity to sign up and be moles; by logging the IP addresses of a swarm, they would then get targets to go after....HOWEVER......

b) anti-piracy is not free and is also of course intended to recover revenue. Public trackers make much easier targets, the popular stuff (which is also in general what revenue protection is aimed at) is downloaded by many more people, whereas a private tracker has much smaller membership.
It's time consuming for anti-pirates to maintain accounts at private trackers; with public trackers one can just jump in straight away and harvest pirate addresses.

c) occasionally, whole private trackers have been targeted; but in general, even though there some famous instances where they have been brought down, the users have not been pursued.

d) one reason I say demonoid counts as public is that one does not need signup to use it, making it equally easy for anti-pirates. I know at least one site that is definitely private where anti-pirates have operated and sent letters to users, but I don't know of any instances personally; I believe  that in practice private trackers are safe, but would be glad to be put right if i am incorrect there.

e) as already implied, anti-piracy definitely concentrates on certain sorts of content- of what you are sharing is rare, or produced by people/companies not rich enough to finance anti-piracy or too obscure to need to, then it is highly unlikely to be a risk.

Basically, if you ask for an invite and don't give me two ratio proofs like it says in the sidebar I just don't reply. BTW, your torrent client ratio or something like demonoid don't count. 

 Now, I could reply back and ask for the ratio proofs and I used to do that actually. This is the reason I don't anymore

&gt;When asking for an invite, INCLUDE AT LEAST 2 PROOFS OF GOOD RATIO (SCREENSHOT AND LINK) AND YOUR EMAIL VIA PRIVATE MESSAGE or you may not receive an invite.

Now, most places have about the same rules, but every place has its own unique things. Hell, a tracker I go to for gabber and such forbids you from seeding past 2.0 ratio to prevent ratio whores (unless it needs a reseed or something). 

 I have had people PM me and just flat out say that they don't have any private trackers to give me proofs from. I have also given those people invites before. I'm not saying I will do that every single time, but sometimes I will. I appreciate the honesty and we all have to start somewhere right? I'm also making this post for everyone that offers invites. I'm sure it has happend to every single person that offers invites here and it can be a little annoying. So, please just follow the rules.

As a result, we're adding a hard ban on both versions. You will not be banned for using those versions, but you will not be able to connect to the tracker with them. It is suggested you use 2.0.4 build 21586 or newer.

uTorrent 3.1.0/3.1.1 has a bug which fails to ban peers for sending bad data. This means if someone is sending you bad data, you could download terabytes from them and have it seriously mess up your stats. uTorrent 3.2 is currently being prepped for release. You can downgrade to an earlier version, upgrade to 3.1.2, or upgrade to 3.2 when it becomes available.

1311875016.0,37,self.trackers,j2d60,An Open Letter to the Public From TheSwarm.me,65,28,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/j2d60/an_open_letter_to_the_public_from_theswarmme/,"Hi Reddit, this is Pantherking from around the tracker world and for now, it seems I have become TheSwarm.me’s PR manager. As you probably know, it’s an uphill battle lol. In the past week or so there has been a lot of noise over TheSwarm more so than usual so I’m here to clear some things up, transparency is now our goal to build trust with our user base!

First off I’ll just recap what has happened. A few days ago, our former SysOp, Maks, decided to take it upon himself to delete everything in retaliation for losing his SysOp status. This was a disaster for TheSwarm as we had to build it back with our backups but we looked at this optimistically; we’d be able to rise from the ashes and start a clean slate. You probably saw my first post about this here on r/trackers. We promoted nicrfe to sysop and had morph in control as an admin.

Then last night, disaster struck once more. It seems nicrfe was a bit closer to maks than we thought and he allowed maks to use his account. Maks once more deleted everything and sent out a mass pm that slandered our staff. We will again, rebuild it all this time with Morph as SysOp. I’m sure Morph will be around to clear some of this up in the comment sections for anything I missed.

Now that we’ve done a bit of history, here are the facts:

* Maks is Peb if you know that name, an infamous character that you may remember 
* Blue = Pham
* Pham has been with us since the beginning
* Pham is a good coder and has literally built the site
* Pham has been paying for the servers the whole time out of his own paycheck
* He will continue doing so until we reopen donations
* Morph will be the new SysOp, he has access to the server and will control the site, he is to be trusted
* Morph will be in charge of donations when they are reopened, pham will never have access
* Pham did use the emails from an old ptp DB to send invites, you all know this
* Pham **did not** DDOS’d PTP
* Maks DDOS’d PTP in the same way he is currently DDOS’ing TheSwarm
* Maks and Nicrfe have fucked up the site, deleting what they could including users and torrents
* Maks was laundering donations because, “it was the right thing to do” evidence for that [here](http://i.imgur.com/SigM8.png)
* Maks used Pham’s reputation to blackmail him and has since continued to use it to slander him and the site
* Morph has full control over the site minus funding which until he can support, Pham will continue to pay for, at least until donations + morph can control it. They have known each other for many years and will work together, not at odds like Maks and Pham were.


Finally, I’ll tell you are plan from here. We are currently doing damage control at the moment both on the site and publicly. We plan on taking it in stride, appointing a new loyal SysOp, and finally we plan on expanding and experimenting with ways to set our tracker apart. There has been much discussion about going ratioless and we are working out the logistics of that. But in all, we are turning over a new leaf and in turn, are striving to become more honest and transparent with our use base. Pham under the name blue will continue to help code our site and until we reopen donations, will pay for it. That is all he will do, nothing sneaky about it really. If you have further questions, feel free to ask and either I or morph will answer them to the best of our ability. Also, **Maks is doing his best to slander the site, ignore his comments here on reddit as they are either lies, or comments taken out of context.**

**UPDATE:** Maks has been actively DDOS'ing the site

I work at a data center.  We host a ton of different machines for many different purposes.  Some VPS and Hard Machines host VPNs or are used as seedboxes.  I see all of the DMCA complaints from the lawyers of studios, etc. 

Effectively, what happens when a company like whatbox leases many VPS each with dedicated IPs (sometimes they will lease a whole hyper-v and run their own VPS' ).  When we receive a DMCA complaint: we notify the responsible party (the owner of the hyper-v) with a 24 hour time window to comply, they then notifies their customer (the owner of the VPS), the owner of the VPS usually doesn't respond within the 24 hour window and the VPS is terminated.

So here's my question:

1.  It seems that most (if not all) DMCA complaints come from the users getting caught *uploading* not downloading.  In theory, I could turn off sharing and never worry about being caught, agree?

2. the problem I see with not uploading is, well, if no one uploads there will be nothing to download, how do so many people get away with uploading and not get caught?

3. has any one used a proxy like [tor](https://www.torproject.org/) or [hidemyass](http://hidemyass.com/)?  Any success stories / horror stories?  How is the speed through a proxy?

4. Any suggestions for private trackers?  I'm mostly looking for network shows.  (Having recently sworn off Comcast.)

5. Any thoughts about usenet vs private trackers?  Has anyone used usenet for downloading video?  (I know there is a whole subreddit, and obviously they *have* used usenet... I want to know why private trackers are better.)",,False,,t5_2rjuw,True,,deluge,True,t3_jxfz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/jxfz7/how_not_to_get_caught/,

Originally the idea of maintaining a good ratio was to encourage everyone to seed for as long as they can thus assuring good download speeds and availability to everyone. The goal has certainly been reached however on many trackers it has become very difficult to maintain a &gt;1 ratio. The reasons vary but they are mostly because either the files you are seeding are not popular enough or that the ratio of seeders/leechers is so high that it takes a very long time to recover back your ratio. 

The way things are working at the moment, users must be extremely careful with what they download when first joining a tracker if they don't want to dig themselves into a hole they can't get out off. It's not impossible to make it through, but it takes a lot of time and planning and turns out to be not really that much *fun*. On many trackers it will take so long for you to be able to enjoy the goods you are after that it kind of beats the purpose in the first place. If I am better off downloading the same thing off TPB then something isn't working as it should.

Many trackers have come up with bonus systems, some of them work, some of them are really bad (in that they make it too easy and original goal of speed and availability is not fulfilled) and others are absolutely necessary to avoid a deadlock. Most trackers even no longer demand a =&gt;1 ratio before they close your account but this all still seems to not be working correctly. 

Personally, I am doing quite fine. I try (and succeed) to maintain a &gt;1 on all the trackers I am in but so often it means that I can't really enjoy what the tracker is offering even though I seed back everything I download that it just doesn't feel right.

As a bit of background, in the United States (at least) there are many laws - mostly focused on specific industries - that require a participant in an activity/industry to comply with certain standards. 

However, these standards are regularly created and maintained by third-party groups (e.g. material quality specifications for construction of certain structure types like skyscrapers vs. residential houses) and are *not* free. You must still obey them to obey the law, but it's pay to play.

In particular I was looking for a tracker that would have not just one instance of documentation (though the standards manual for new york county in 2007 is very interesting) but regularly has the, often annual, updates. Hopefully, one that has the [SIGIS Eligible Products List](https://www.sig-is.org/programs/eligible-product-list).

But there're some things that are still unclear to me, and I really hoped you guys could help me out:

1. Will I still be downloading a .torrent file to my computer, or is simply giving the address of that .torrent to my seedbox enough?

2. As I understand, it would be ""safest"" to get to my downloaded files using a SFTP protocol. But how do I do that? I get a seedbox, I download something, I put it on my computer. How can I ensure that I am *actually using* SFTP?   
Do I simply use something like WinSCP (i.e. can I just drag and drop files from the seedbox to my (Win7) computer)? And is this possible with every seedbox provider?  
(as you may notice, this is the part that confuses me most)

3. [Feral Hosting](https://www.feralhosting.com/features) has OpenVPN, ""to secure your Internet communications to the server"" - what exactly does that mean, and why would I want to have this?

4. Will I have to re-download all the torrents I am currently seeding to my seedbox?

---

And now for the providers - I am still pending between

- [Feral Hosting](http://www.feralhosting.com/pricing) (Helium) (although the 3 months minimum subscription is a huge bummer),  
- [Whatbox](http://whatbox.ca/) (the 200GB Flex), and  
- [ByteSized](https://bytesized-hosting.com/) (Gourmet Box - although 600GB are probably much more space than I'll actually need, and the others are too small).

Are there any *major* differences between those 3 providers I should consider (I live in Europe, btw)?

Also, is there any specific reason for the (sometimes rather significant) price differences between them?

If you avoid downloading recently released films, recent award-winning films, films called out as being unsafe within forums, it's highly improbably that you will ever get a letter.

My motto is: watch recent releases at the *theater* (or rent/buy) and never ever download something of the current year (like 2012). I got a few letters back in the day but after this adjustment, it hasn't happened in many years. 

I've never heard of any friends getting letters over TV, software, and even music. It's always recently released film. For instance, the most retarded thing you can do is download Oscar winning films right after the Academy Awards. 

Just a couple pointers for anyone new to this game. Torrenting is very safe if you are clever about it. :)

PS- Demonoid is probably a honeypot. Be careful!

I'm bored and wanted to share a little bit about my favorite tracker, rutracker.org.

Rutracker is a Russian super tracker that virtually no one in the West seems to use.  All of the text is in Russian (no English allowed), and I think that tends to scare people off.  However, if you're willing to learn just a FEW key words in Russian (""download,"" ""ratio,"" etc.), it's probably one of the best trackers around. 

They have all the typical scene files, but they also have a ton of rare content.  Just to name a few, they have specialized categories for bellydancing, Spanish telenovelas, comic books, hang-gliding, lossless music, iphone apps, ballroom dancing, music videos, martial arts, and pretty much anything else you can think of.  Many, many things that you can't find anywhere else.  

The speeds are good, it's virtually ratio-free, and they have over a million torrents.  The only downside is it takes some effort to navigate the site at first.

IMO, this is a must-have tracker.

&gt; Therefore, we have decided to resurrect bitGAMER as best we could in order to allow gamers to continue to have a home in order to share their torrents. I want to make it clear that this tracker has not been created by former bitGAMER staff, the last thing we want is for them to receive threats for something they have not done.

&gt;We are however looking for any previous bitGAMER staff that would like to resume their roles if they wish to, or previous experienced members.

Some site owners draw their own little icons for the first column to indicate ""Movies"", ""Apps"", and so on, but few strive to improve the overall usability of the site.

Some sites enforce very strict tagging rules, with e.g. \[Company\] and \[Resolution\] tags being required, which in itself improves the browsing experience, but the logical next step seems to be implementing the tags as database columns instead, opening up for e.g. sets of static tags. Also starting to require IMDB ID/Discogs link or similar would be very welcome in most database layouts.

Cheggit implementet chained tags, which for adult trackers was a winner. Kickasstorrents, which is a public indexer, is putting a surprising amount of work into making the site both pretty and usable, but one simple innovation I'd like to see adopted by other sites is the ""Feedback"" feature: Whenever you download a torrent, it is added to your feedback list, so you are reminded to rate the torrent whenever you come back to the site.

* Pros: resumable rating A+; can play video while downloading
* Cons: transfers seem much much slower than all other FTP clients (""Maximum Simultaneous Transfers"" set to 6); don't love the interface; this will work but would like another solution

**BitKinex**

* Pros: Resumable rating A+; if crashes also resumable; SFTP/FTP
* Cons: Cannot watch a video as it is downloading, if I could do this I would love BitKinex

**GoFTP**

* Pros: resumable rating B; can play video while dowloading
* Cons: resume sometimes fails and starts download from scratch; can't seem to find how to adjust the amount of multi-segments

**Downthemall - Firefox**

* Pros: resumable rating C; easy to use; can add or remove segments;  can setup a queue; can play video while downloading
* cons: if FF crashes, sometimes the download will not resume and start from scratch; each segment requires the user to re-enter credentials

**FTP Alternatives**

* Could I use my SeedBox as a tracker and download the files through my home BT?  I would be the only user connected and set to sequential download in order to stream immediately.  Not sure if this is frowned upon or simply a waste.
* Other protocols people tend to use?


edit: after trying nearly every method, I have settled on lftp... it is by far the best.  My home server runs XP so in order to use lftp you need to install it via cygwin.  [This tutorial is awesome](http://www.torrent-invites.com/seedbox-tutorials/132965-tutorial-auto-sync-seedbox-home-linux-mac-machine-lftp-shell-script-2.html), I highly recommend it.

I'm twcaiwh and I am a moderator of /r/ProjectNarwhal, along with being a community coordinator for the Project itself.  I'm posting here today to let you guys know about our Project, which hopes to change the world of Private Trackers by offering a better experience and a better platform for end-users, developers, and admins/mods alike.  



**Our Mission Statement: **
&gt;**What Is Narwhal?**

&gt;Narwhal hopes to be the next generation in private tracker platforms;  Essentially, we aim to create a new platform to address a number of issues with the current standard (Gazelle) as well as accommodating the growing and versatile needs of the private tracker community.

&gt;**Anatomy of Narwhal**

&gt;Narwhal is being built with a ""modular"" design with two closely coordinated efforts;  Narwhal-Core and Narwhal-Plugins.  Narwhal-Core is just what it sounds like;  the ""skeleton"" of Narwhal.  Most features (the organs) will be built as plugins, ""snapping in"" to Narwhal-Core.  This allows private trackers two advantages;  First, their servers must only dedicate resources to features they wish to use, keeping their installation of Narwhal lightweight and responsive.  Secondly, the modular design allows much easier addition of features compared to the traditional method of adding code to a bloated platform and having to ""hack on"" functions.

&gt;**A Closer Look**

&gt;Narwhal will stress code readability/organization and ease of access to the codebase, making devs' lives a lot easier by cutting down on the amount of time spent searching through the platform code in order to make changes or troubleshoot problematic code.  The ""plugin"" system we're crafting with Narwhal will also allow devs to write or modify plugins to make changes or additions rather than modifying the core system and risking ""breaking"" something else.

&gt;**Community**

&gt;Project Narwhal is a project by the community, for the community.  This means the project has no one leader, but rather leaves major decisions to the entirety of Team Narwhal.  This also means that anybody can have a hand in the growth of Narwhal;  Non-devs are more than welcome to play their part in coming up with ideas for features, etc.  We believe everyone has, at one time or another, had ideas or criticisms for their private tracker(s) of choice that may now be heard and considered in earnest.

&gt;**Growth**

&gt;An integral part of our efforts is to build a platform with an open road ahead of it;  Once Narwhal is ""complete,"" we hope the nature of its design will allow a whole community to build up around it consisting of users and devs alike, all working together to add new and interesting things to the Narwhal experience.


Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have, explore [/r/ProjectNarwhal](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectNarwhal/), and even join the Team if you'd like!

this is just my 2 cents worth, but I've noticed how many of us do not have much money to rent a seedbox that would cost $15++ a month, so I thought I'd contribute.


Caveats: 


1) I do not profess to have much technical skill with Linux, but I managed to build my own using tutorials I found through google; a lot of trial and error; and patience.


2) Since I was on a budget, the seedbox I managed to cobble together did not have as much bandwidth or HDD space as a dedicated, and more expensive, seedbox.


3) Since this is about budget DIY seedboxes, bandwidth is limited.



My basic guide:



Step one: Find a cheap VPS (Virtual Private Server). A VPS is basically a Virtual Machine that for all intents and purposes functions exactly like your own dedicated server, except the resources are shared by many other people on the same physical server. I'd recommend at least 512mb of RAM, 30gb of HDD space and 1000gb of bandwidth. [Have a look at this site](http://www.lowendbox.com) for deals. Be sure to read through the comments on how reliable each VPS provider is. I paid $5/mth for mine.


Step Two: Secure your VPS. This part is a bit technical, but have a read through [this forum post on Webhostingtalk.](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=468168)


Step Three: [Install webmin.](http://www.webxpert.ro/andrei/2009/05/30/install-webmin-on-ubuntu-server-904-jaunty-jackalope/) It's a web-based GUI which will make configuring key aspects of your VPS much easier.


Step Four: Installing a torrent client.  I used [this tutorial](http://filesharefreak.com/2010/02/13/how-to-install-rtorrent-rutorrent-using-socket-ssl-authentication-on-ubuntu-or-debian/) to install rTorrent and ruTorrent.


Step Five: The final step is to transfer all those sweet sweet files from your VPS to your own computer. There are many ways of doing this. I just googled on how to create an FTP server on ubuntu, and there are tons on information on it.

This is another product from BitTorrent Labs (brother of BitTorrent Live and a number of other projects not that much popular). It's first purpose is secure files sync between your computers with an option to share them with your friends. As you may have understood the technology beyond this is peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol, but it's  trackerless (though you can optionally specify a tracker for it for example if peers can't ""talk"" directly):

&gt; Local peer discovery

&gt; Peer exchange (PEX)

&gt; DHT

All transfered data is encrypted:

&gt; All the traffic between devices is encrypted with AES cypher and a 256-bit key created on the base of the secret—a random string (20 bytes or more) that is unique for every folder.

You are **limited only by your storage size** - use as much as you need. No other services needed, no middle men.

You may also grant write access to specific peers, but gerenal config is only one writer. You can add and remove content from the syncing directory - all subscribed peers will get your changes at once.

You can choose client compatible with your system:

* Windows (XP SP3 or newer)

* Mac OSX (10.6 or newer)

* Android
 
* *iOS (coming soon)*

* Linux (ARM, PowerPC, i386, x64, PPC QorIQ, i386 (glibc 2.3), x64 (glibc 2.3)

* FreeBSD (i386, x64)

So my question to you - would this technology replace torrents? Would you switch to BT Sync for certain needs?

So.. where to begin?

I created SuperTorrents over 9 years ago when I was 16 and still in high school with the help of some people that are no longer affiliated with the site. Roughly 3-4 years ago I stopped working on it and moved on to other, more legitimate things and I’ve been looking to distance myself from SuperTorrents for some time now.

This, coupled with PRQ (our server host) recently having their PayPal account shut down and only taking payments via Swedish bank transfer, and the fact that this site has been costing quite a bit of money (roughly $1000/month) out of my own pocket since we stopped accepting donations a year ago has led me to the decision that I no longer want to be affiliated with or pay for the site any longer.

As I have not been running it for 3-4 years, I’ve given the team currently running the site access to the database and allowed them to make a new website using it that does not bear any affiliation to me, or the SuperTorrents/ST brand in general. I believe they intend to keep all accounts and ratios/ranks as they were, but that is subject to change.

As far as I know, they are still deciding on what to name the new site and setting it up. This should be completed in a matter of days and the link will be available on this page when it is complete.

Also, my SeedBox company, Seed.ST, is not affected by SuperTorrents closing, it will continue to run and be updated and maintained and we have big plans for it in the near future.

Thanks for sticking with us all these years, and I wish the current team good luck on their endeavour.

P.S. here is the PreDB we built over the last 9 years (4.8 million pre’s).

From torrentfreak :

SuperTorrents Admin Calls it Quits, Site to Rebrand

After nine years of operation, the admin of long-standing private tracker SuperTorrents says he’s had enough.

In the torrent world, running a site that lasts anywhere near a decade is quite an achievement but that’s something accomplished by SuperTorrents founder Ersan.

The private tracker was founded more than nine years ago and has survived a few dramas, including a very public spat in 2007 which saw hackers allegedly send $2,000 of the site’s donations to a religious group.

But now it’s all coming to an end – sort of.

“I created SuperTorrents over 9 years ago when I was 16 and still in high school with the help of some people that are no longer affiliated with the site,” Ersan announced yesterday.

“Roughly 3-4 years ago I stopped working on it and moved on to other, more legitimate things and I’ve been looking to distance myself from SuperTorrents for some time now.”

Ersan says that the site suffered money problems during the past year after it stopped accepting donations. Additional problems were caused when the site’s host, PRQ, had their PayPal account shutdown and could only accept cash via bank transfer. This, Ersan said, led him to the decision to part company with the site.

“As I have not been running it for 3-4 years, I’ve given the team currently running the site access to the database and allowed them to make a new website using it that does not bear any affiliation to me, or the SuperTorrents/ST brand in general. I believe they intend to keep all accounts and ratios/ranks as they were, but that is subject to change,” he explained.

The new site will be called Stellarwinds.me and should be up in the days to come.

“Thanks for sticking with us all these years, and I wish the current team good luck on their endeavor,” Ersan concludes.",,False,,t5_2rjuw,1373376007.0,,tti,True,t3_1hxebi,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1hxebi/supertorrents_has_been_rebranded_as_stellarwindsme/,

I try to keep very organized, and rename/reorganize things as I download them.

Are there any shortcuts for this, or should I just run 2 clients until I've got time to do it? Would running 2 clients on the same machine cause problems?

We intend to release a larger update within a month, so keep an eye on the news section for further developments regarding the site's financial future, and your role in shaping it.*

&gt;*We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed in the form of a direct donation or store purchase since the time of the last announcement. This fundraiser has proven successful enough to keep the site running in the short term. The final two weeks of April were especially strong, and if this is indicative of a continuing trend, it would suggest that we're momentarily in the black as of the time of this post.*

&gt;*However, it is clear that funding What.CD is a challenge with more systemic problems (as is indicated by previous fundraisers). Without stimulating the user base with an occasional call for help, we eventually fall behind. As the site grows, our bills grow. With this comes the cost of server upgrades. Keep in mind that we own our servers, so fixed costs are a luxury we do not enjoy. As stated previously, the cost of one server breakdown can easily exceed many months of average operating costs.*

&gt;*For these reasons, it is difficult to fund the site primarily through the What.CD Online Store, although it helps. But the reality is that not everyone wants to purchase merchandise, nor is everyone willing (or able) to pay for costly international shipping. While the store will remain an effective way for users to show their support for the site, we understand that it isn't an absolute solution.*

&gt;*We also acknowledge that everyone would prefer additional options which allow closer to 100% of contributions to directly fund the site—something impossible to achieve when selling tangible products. Toward this end, we have been discussing the implementation of new donation incentives, as well as a more profitable utilization of the store. Changes beyond these are being discussed, but are nowhere ready for public hinting, much less public introduction.*

&gt;*Beyond keeping the site afloat, additional short-term goals include replenishing a safety net of emergency funds, and funding an overdue hardware upgrade. The longest-term and most important goal remains ensuring that each month's donations haul is at least large enough to cover monthly costs.*

&gt;*At this time, we encourage our users to be patient. Proper execution of our plans requires frequent discussion as a staff team, coordination with external partners, many developer hours, and time spent ensuring the security of everyone involved.*

&gt;*But, hey—thanks to you, we're still here. Turn it to eleven and kick it*",,False,,t5_2rjuw,False,,scc,True,t3_1fpbmi,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1fpbmi/whatcd_financial_update_part_one/,

I can't seed because if I download a movie and nobody leeches I lose my ratio, and I can't seed because there are no leechers :( (don't get me even started on seedboxes). It's very disappointing. HDChina does the old format best by giving a -50% download for the newest torrents to get the fire started. 

Before you say ""more h&amp;r's and people abusing it"", most of these trackers have very small communities compared to public trackers. BTN does this neatly. So well that even though I  have downloaded a lot on it, I still seed **a lot** compared to other trackers. 


TL;DR would you like to see BTN-esque ratio-formats on other trackers? 

**If anyone doesn't know what the sytem is: on BTN there is no ""download"". Only upload. You don't *need* to seed back all those GBs, you can just seed for 24h (episode) or 120h (season).

&gt;Hey there, everyone.
I'm sorry to report that EmulateThe.Net will be shutting down effective October 1st. It was a fun, but short-lived journey and unfortunately, it's time for that journey to come to an end. I apologize for whatever anyone feels they've lost here, but I've taken from this experience that I'll be applying to Awesome-HD as I'm a developer there, and possibly in the future, newer, more organized trackers. It was certainly a learning experience, but now we must meld back into the shadows. If you'd like a particular reason for the closing, it's the result of quite a few things. There was a large amount of inactivity from the initial staff group, there was a lack of distinction between ranking in the staff, and there was a lack of appeal from the user base. I was left in charge of most everything, and between managing this, and managing my real life, I decided that it was not worth it to continue managing a site so barely used and so carelessly ignored by it's staff. In a much smaller part, I've had less time to manage the site as I've had things to do with my real life. Perhaps we'll be back in the future, in a much more organized form, but for now, this is the end. I apologize if it seems selfish, but my time and effort is valuable, and I have decided that I want to dedicate it to something that will be enjoyed and taken advantage of by a larger basis. If you would like to keep in touch with me or see my work on Awesome-HD, I have links to my profiles on both What and AHD in my profile here, and I will provide invites to AHD if you're not already a member there. Anyway, thanks for your time, and sorry again.

Aaron

I have been wondering for a few months now about the fragility of the private tracker environment (an idea recently peaked by the domain shuffling that some of the more public sites underwent).  While they often go to appreciable lengths to remain 'under the radar', information about most of the private trackers is easily obtained.  Add some extra time and resources, and anyone who has an inquisitive purpose and dedication can achieve entry into most.

So with all that setup the main questions are:

* Assuming enforcement agencies are already inside, are they capable of actually accomplishing any disruptive actions?

* Is the 'eye' of those who would wish these networks ill, simply focused on larger, more obvious targets?

* Are users actually making sound observations when they cite the 'safety' of private trackers?

* How long with private trackers remain a safe haven?

It keeps track of files, seeds, peers, and IP addresses. Then, when a user is trying to download a file, it just asks the tracker software for information about how to find that file.

First of all I am not too new to trackers. Back in the day I used Kazaa, Limewire, Bearshare, etc. Even a couple years ago I was using TPB and  KAT. That was all 99% music. However recently(as in a day ago) I purchased a Roku and my movie/show/music library is in desperate need of beefing up so I can have more content to stream through PLEX.

*Here is where I get a little confused. Sorry but I don't want to just dive in any further without knowing a little about what the hell I am doing.* 

I signed up at Movie-Torrentz because they are having open signups until the 30th. I probably can't get an invite without DONATING(IPT as example) to any other website because I have never been on one. I figured this would be a good stepping stone. **Am I correct in this?**

Okay this may sound extremely dumb but I really don't know. For private trackers do I still need a bittorrent client to download stuff like utorrent or something similar?

SEEDING. How do I go about seeding on private trackers? I know I want to keep my ratio at 1:1 and a good starting point is free leech content. How do I go about it though? Do I do it through the bittorrent client?(If I even use one, sorry I am clueless) When I used to download on public trackers I would unseed immediately, yes I was a mooch. However I realize private trackers enforce rules and regulations and it is either seed or get banned for the most part. I have no problem seeding I just don't want to get banned for ignorantly doing something wrong. Also for non free leech content how long do I need to seed something for? I currently have Comcast Blast! service so my internet isn't horrible. Should I be able to maintain a 1:1 ratio if I seed something for 48 hours? I saw the 48hr time frame thrown around in my researching. 

SEEDBOX. I am not going to be downloading 100's of things a month. Maybe 1-7 movies a week. Greatly depends. It is my understanding that you use a seedbox to basically download content directly from the source at a faster speed from a different location. It basically puts an added layer of protection in the event of a ""swarm"".(Assuming this is like a government swarm where they collect IP addresses and stuff?) I have read for and against the use of seedboxes for minimal users like I plan on being. I do not want to download tons and tons of stuff, just want to be an average user. Do I need to invest in a seedbox? I feel like if I do invest in a seedbox I would be much more inclined to download large amounts of content as opposed to the few movies a week I plan on doing.

VPN. I haven't even looked into this but it is something similar to a seedbox I think? Do I even need to worry about it? 

Should I download during off peak hours? I have no idea if this is safer or faster or what the actual advantages this could return to me would be, just a question I thought up.

Anything else? Remember, I am someone who hasn't downloaded anything in at least 2-3 years and have never used a private tracker before. Did I miss anything or do I need to know anything else to get started?

1365686168.0,22,self.trackers,1c4ruc,CHDbits rules on the use of Seedboxes - April 8th,43,21,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1c4ruc/chdbits_rules_on_the_use_of_seedboxes_april_8th/,"Rules and regulations on the usage of Seedbox(es)

Seedbox is like a Swiss army knife in the torrent world. While it helps seeders to do their part, it eases the process of hit and run too. Some users were even dedicated to cheat the tracker by transferring data among boxes. In order to ensure the interests of the other seedbox members as well as to further discourage the malicious usage of seeboxes, below is the new guideline for seedbox users.

i) Definition of Seedbox(es)
A Seedbox includes, but not limited to, Seedbox provided by Seedbox provider, VPS provided by IDC, dedicated server and any other datacenter facility that allows users to download and upload torrents.

ii) Seedbox usage
 1&gt;Any Seedbox used for CHDBits’ torrents should meet ALL five (5) criteria as listed below:
   a&gt; has a dedicated IP, and the IP is being used by the particular user only
   b&gt; has proof of payment, legal agreement of usage as well as any other certificate / proof of rental from the original service provider.
   c&gt; Rental period of not less than a calendar month
   d&gt; only one CHDBits member is using the box during the rental period
   e&gt; for non-speculative purpose only

Below are some examples which will help you understand in a better way:
   a&gt; A user wants to rent two months of Seedbox with shared IP. The Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   b&gt; A user wants to rent two weeks of Seedbox with dedicated IP. Nobody shares the IP address with the user. The Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   c&gt; A user won a free seedbox from some service provider promotion, forum giveaway, lucky draw, etc. The Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   d&gt; A service provider provides more than 50% discount (for first month only)  on their dedicated server. A user then buy and discontinue the Seedbox on the following month. This Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   e&gt; A Seedbox is paid for 3 months period and then resold / transferred to another user on the second month. The Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   f&gt; A Seedbox was used for over a year or so and then resold / transferred to another user. This Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   g&gt; A Seedbox was sold to first user from a reseller for couple of months and then sold to second user upon termination of the first user. This Seedbox is not allowed in CHDBits.
   h&gt; A reseller bought a dedicated server and setup VPSes with dedicated IP each VPS. No VPS in this scenario is allowed in CHDBits.
   i&gt; A reseller bought a dedicated server and setup multiple torrent clients. Each torrent client is assigned with a dedicated IP. This server is not allowed in CHDBits.
   j&gt; User A’s dedicated server with dedicated IP was expired and returned to service provider. The server is then bought by User B from the service provider (not reseller). User B IS ALLOWED to use the said server.

remarks: besides the scenario above, other boxes that do not meet the requirements as stated in 1&gt; is not allowed in CHDBits.

 2&gt; The purchase receipt and letter of assignment of the dedicated server is the only way to proof your ownership of the server. You’re required to keep it for verification purpose.

 3&gt; Seedboxes should be registered via designated registration page prior to downloading/seeding torrents. Any other way of registration will be deemed void.

 4&gt; Seedboxes should be deregistered once they are no longer being used for CHDBits’ torrents.

iii) Seedbox registration
 1&gt; Target audience: all CHDBits members

 2&gt; Registration page: visit http://chdbits.org/seedbox.php or via  “User CP” – “Personal Settings”.

 3&gt; Registration process and requirements:
   a&gt; Seedbox’s IP: complete ipv4 address must be filled in. All information provided during the registration will not be disclosed to third party and will be kept private and confidential.
   b&gt; URL of the service provider’s page of registration. E.g. http://www.ovh.com/us/dedicated-servers/ instead of their homepage (http://www.ovh.com/). You must include http:// in your URL.
   c&gt; Seedbox model: Enter the model name as provided by the service provider (e.g. KS Servers). If there aren’t any, please use any name that could distinguish the box from other boxes.
   d&gt; upload and download speed: unit in Mbps
   e&gt; Purchase option
     1) Select “Retail” if the Seedbox is obtained directly from service provider. All proof of purchase must be kept safely for audit purpose. The email/id used to purchase the Seedbox should be similar to your CHDBits username/registered email, if not identical.
     2) Select “Reseller” if the Seedbox is obtained from third-party and provide the details accordingly. For example, agent’s E-Bay id, website, etc. Please obtain the “URL of the service provider’s page of registration” as stated above from your agent, as well as proof of purchase, receipt, etc for audit purpose.
   f&gt; Seedbox info may not be modified once added. Please make sure the correct information is keyed in before submission.
   g&gt; Seedbox info will appear at the bottom of the page once the registration is successful.

 4&gt; Deregistration
   a&gt; If the Seedbox is no longer in use, please remove it from the registration page and fill in the reason.
   b&gt; If deletion is required due to incorrect information keyed in during the registration process, please specify the mistake made in the column.
   c&gt; Seedbox should never be deregistered while in use.

 5&gt; Notes on registration
   a&gt; The registration date will be treated as the first day of usage of the Seedbox in CHDBits. Please download at least 1 complete torrent for confirmation purpose. No other requirement thereafter.
   b&gt; The deregistration date will be treated as the last day of usage of the Seedbox in CHDBits. Please download at least 1 complete torrent for confirmation purpose. As it takes time for the Seedbox to be ready for usage after registration, at least 25 days between registration date and deregistration date is accepted as 1 month usage.
   c&gt; Users must register all their seedboxes. Selective registration is not allowed.
   d&gt; URL of reseller where the box is purchased from (e.g. ebay.com) cannot be used as “service provider’s page of registration”.
   e&gt; Classmates, friends, colleagues, relatives, etc as “reseller” is not allowed. Please buy directly from the service provider.

iv) Violations and penalties
 1&gt; Actions as stated below will be granted 4-8 weeks of warning, barred from downloading torrents for 2-4 weeks or disablement of account.
   a&gt; Register the seedbox within 3 days AFTER the seedbox is being used.
   b&gt; Mass downloading / uploading torrents (minor case)
   c&gt; Mass transfer among boxes (different users) for credits (minor case)
   d&gt; Disturb the other users download/upload experience with the usage of Seedbox

 2&gt; Actions below will lead to immediate disablement of account:
   a&gt; Second violation of rules as stated in 1&gt; above
   b&gt; Never register the seedbox after the seedbox is being used for more than 3 days.
   c&gt; Deregister the Seedbox while it’s still in use.
   d&gt; Use a shared IP seedbox.
   e&gt; Share Seedbox with dedicated IP among other users.
   f&gt; Use a Seedbox for less than a month.
   g&gt; Modify or use the Seedbox for cheating purpose.
   h&gt; Register a Seedbox obtained from unapproved reseller as if they registered directly from the service provider
   i&gt; cover up where the Seedbox’s actually from.
   j&gt; abuse the Seedbox registration page (fake data, spam fake registration, etc.)
   k&gt; Download/upload maliciously
   l&gt; Mass transfer among different boxes with other users / groups maliciously
   m&gt; disturb the normal operation of the website with seedboxes

v) Other notes:
 1&gt; For those who bought the Seedbox directly from the service provider, please request for confirmation that the IP is a dedicated one, by email or ticketing system.
 2&gt; Those who bought the Seedboxes thru a reseller are solely responsible to make sure the Seedboxes meet the criteria as stated above. Please do not buy from those who could not produce the proof of payment, letter of confirmation, etc. from the service provider. The user will be liable for all consequences that might arise from improper Seedbox usage or violation of the above rules.
 3&gt; Due to transparency problem and potential risk from buying Seedbox via reseller, we strongly recommend members to buy Seedbox direct from the service provider.

vi) Date of enforcement
These rules will be enforced the moment this notice is announced. Users should stop using Seedboxes which do not meet the requirements as stated above immediately. All Seedboxes should be registered before 15th of April 2013.

vii) Transition period
 1&gt; Users should stop using their Seedboxes temporarily if they suspect the Seedboxes is not in conformity with requirements as stated above. Users may resume using the Seedboxes after confirmation of conformity.
 2&gt; If the Seedbox will expire in less than a month from today (the date of this announcement is made), please renew for another month or stop using the Seedbox immediately. Thank you for your understanding.

CHDBits admin team reserves the right of final interpretation and decision on all rules, as well as the modification of the rules.

Disclaimer: If there is any inconsistency or ambiguity between the English version and the Chinese version, the CHINESE version shall prevail.

When I was in college, I got a nasty letter for torrenting a TV show. After college, I found my way into a private site with password protected rar's hosted on Megaupload. After MU went down, I moved over to usenet, but my usenet provider has started getting DMCA takedowns, which makes it largely useless to me.


I've signed up for Private Internet Access. So far, it's working great. PIA allows each user to have two simultaneous connections to different servers. As such, I've configured my router to tunnel traffic to a nearby PIA server, and on my torrenting machine, I've installed PIA and had it connect to their Sweden server. The effect is that the two VPN's are effectively chained together. The VPN server that the router connects to knows my IP, and the VPN server that accesses the torrents only sees the IP of the first VPN server. The first one knows ""who"", but not ""what"", and the second knows ""what"" but not ""who""... assuming PIA doesn't log.


And that's what I keep worrying about. I feel like I'm putting all my eggs in the PIA basket. I've been thinking of, as a last step, signing for something like the BTGuard proxy and paying with Bitcoin, so BTGuard wouldn't know my payment details or my real IP. This would give me three layers of Indirection: Me -&gt; PIA (America) -&gt; PIA(Europe) -&gt; BTGuard(Europe) -&gt; torrent. 


My questions are:


* Do I even need BTGuard? Has anyone ever gotten a letter while using PIA?
* Could PIA be coerced into maintaining logs without notifying users?
* Combined, these come to about $100 a year. This is roughly the price of Netflix streaming. Should I give up the dream?
* I'm a few years out of college now and have a house and nontrivial assets saved up. If I was to get sued, I'd have a whole lot to lose. My ISP, as far as I can tell, does not participate in six strikes, which I assume opens me up to getting sued.

And a quick question about seeding since I'm here.  Do you have to keep your material in the same folder it downloaded to to seed?  I like to organize my stuff so I move each file into its respectable folder (ie, movies, TV shows, anime, etc).  So I usually seed to 1 then remove it.

&gt;*  **PlayStation 2** is now a Safe Console (all PS2 games are now safe to upload).   
&gt;*  **Applications for Windows 3.x (and earlier versions)** are now Safe.   
&gt;*  Not gaming-specific **Retro Computing Literature** is now Safe.   
&gt;
&gt;Further, **all torrents in the PlayStation 2, Windows 3.x Applications and Retro Computing Literature categories will be on freeleech** until the end of January.
&gt;
&gt;As always, consult the Upload Rules or use the Safe Content Forum if you are unsure if your content is safe to upload on Underground Gamer.

We've just introduced a new feature to the site: The HnR Warning Counter.

Some of you have noticed this feature and we're already receiving quite a negative response.

Please read this thread carefully.

First of all, the Hit and Run system has not been changed.

This counter has always existed, its just been for staff accounts only, up until now.

The only thing this counter does is show you how many Hit &amp; Run warnings you've had for the lifespan of your account.

The number it shows are not new warnings, they are old ones that you've gotten in the past and probably forgot about.

The counter serves no other purpose.

It is just there to let you know how many warnings you've had.

As you know, if you hit four warnings, your account is at risk for demotion - so this is there so you can easily see how many warnings you've had and to ensure that you don't go over 4.

Once again, I'd like to make this clear - nothing has changed. If you all of a sudden see "" HnR Warnings: 1"" and you have no idea where you got that one warning, it was probably months ago, or even last year.

Warnings don't expire. When you get one, its logged on your account.

Donating resets this counter but as we said, donation is not required at any point for any IPT user.

Just seed, and zap torrents as needed and you'll never need to donate or get warnings.

We are just trying to make this clear.

Regards,
IPT STAFF.",,False,,t5_2rjuw,False,,tti,True,t3_1gmfm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1gmfm9/iptorrents_new_feature_the_hnr_warning_counter/,

For a refresher, below are some of the troubles experienced by Demonoid in chronological order (from Wikpedia):

* September 25, 2007, the Demonoid website, forums and trackers went offline. They came back four days later with the exception of the website, which came back the day after. 
* November 9, 2007, the site again went offline, reportedly due to legal threats to their service provider from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. The site then came back online on April 11, 2008. 
* September 14, 2009, Demonoid's torrent tracker went down after it was reported that they had experienced a number of hardware problems stemming from power outages. The tracker returned to service on November 5, and the main site returned on December 13.
* April 26, 2010, Demonoid.com, started experiencing downtime or extreme slowness. A message was posted on the site that it was due to a denial-of-service attack, which has subsided as of July 2010.
* July 24, 2012, Demonoid.me suffered another denial-of-service attack, bringing the site down for an indeterminate amount of time.
* August 1, 2012, the site’s main domain has been changed by the admin, redirecting straight to an ad network. Reportedly, these advertisements are links to malware.
* August 3, 2012, the site's administrator promised to bring back Demonoid, though no date was given.
* August 6, 2012, Ukrainian authorities shut down Demonoid manually from Ukraine's largest data center ColoCall.

The level I'm at when it comes to torrenting is limited to vuze, thepiratebay, and torrent files. Is tracker referring to sites that have the torrents where a public one are sites like thepiratebay and private ones being demonoid. Or is trackers and torrents a completely different thing?

Side question:
If this is the right place to ask, great. I use vuze and thepiratebay to download torrents. At my college campus, I can't download files from thepiratebay and files in cuze won't download from seeders. Are there ways to bypass the system?

I just don't see the point. They are not affiliated to the scene in any way as the scene is anti P2P and any tracker found to be releasing scene content would be hated the the scene just as much as a P2P tracker.
 
The only benefit I can see of a scene tracker is to get packs and then cross seed to build ratio on other trackers, but then what? Scene content tends to be released sooner(not always though) but at poorer quality, so this seems to be like a disease, where poor quality stuff infects the P2P community!

I can understand trackers which have scene and P2P content as it makes sense not to limit things, but it's almost like scene trackers are put up on pedestals by the BT community which I do not get. It makes no sense to me that trackers with limited content of lower quality releases are deemed good!

When I first got into the BT community I presumed scene trackers were the scene gateway to the BT world and on their forums there must be uber leet people discussing seriously secret scene stuff and throwing about invites to all the top trackers to each other. Now that I understand a bit more, I have no idea what the attraction is. I've heard people say trackers like FTN are all about the epeen status due the rarity of invites and that once there it's pretty shit, but is that true?
I've learnt a fair bit about UK-T, and was a member of UK-2 for a while, and whilst I appreciate UK-2 was absolute garbage and a very poor companion to UK-T, I read a load of posts from old members discussing what was good about UK-T. The answer seemed to be that it was a close-knit community where they were pretty good friends and talked to each other every day, but the content was very average although requests were filled. I get why that might have been good but what is good about FTN, FSC or SCC(I'm in)? What am I missing? Is it not always going to be better to have both scene and P2P content?

Would the steps be identical to cross-seeding torrents that you downloaded?

p.s. sorry for the caps, I forgot to include the word ""Private"" in the title. Just to avoid confusion.

EDIT:

To recap the discussion, particularly with Transmission:

1. Changing the piece size of the torrent is not an option since it's automatically set. 
2. Simply renaming the files and point the new torrent to the same files results in the following prompt: ""a transfer of x already exists-the transfer cannot be added because it is a duplicate of an already existing transfer.""
3. Another option is by using the command line mktor that will let you add the tracker to the info hash, but it might not be for casual users?
4. Using other clients for creating a new torrent with different chunk sizes for the same data files.
5. Another solution is to slightly alter the data files to be uploaded to the second tracker e.g. add a small info.txt file in the folder to change the file list, in turn changing the info dict, but some users might consider this as a junk file.

Although TPB has been surpassed by private trackers etc, it's still public enemy no 1 in the eyes of the Entertainment company's. With magnet links becoming the norm on TPB the opportunity is ripe to truly transcend TPB into immortality :)

1329895177.0,22,self.trackers,q0n5t,IPTorrents will remove invites for most of its users in 4 days. For those of you who don't have this essential tracker get in while you still can.,25,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/q0n5t/iptorrents_will_remove_invites_for_most_of_its/,"IPTorrents is perhaps the largest private tracker of its kind and has an incredible amount of content including tv, movies, music, software, porn, games etc. I would say it's one of those private trackers that almost everyone on this subreddit should and can be a part of. 

Unfortunately, they will remove invites from all their power users on Feb 25 and thus invites will become really tough to come by, as only VIPs and uploader classes would still have them. 

**Advantages**:

1. It is quite easy to get into (at least for the next 4 days, after which it will be quite tough - unless they change the policy). You can try r/tracker's own [invite thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/ov6c0/consolidated_invite_thread_version_2_alpha/?sort=new) or [r/invites](http://www.reddit.com/r/Invites/). If not, just search on google or the usual invite forums and you should find someone willing to give you one soon enough.

2. It has the highest amount of content I have seen on a private tracker and you can get almost movies, tv shows etc. on it.

3. It is really easy to seed and has a ton of freeleech content, so it is easy to maintain a ratio here.

4. For those who can't maintain several accounts for dedicated trackers, this is a one stop-shop solution. For those who do maintain dedicated trackers, this is a great backup solution.

5. Plenty of movie packs - has to be seen to be believed.

6. Has a .ru domain for those whose ISP's block their .com domain.

**Disadvantages**:

1. Most elite tracker snobs scoff at it because it's so easy to get into.

2. Being a huge tracker, some would say it's riskier in terms of getting caught by MPAA/RIAA. It's still far better than public trackers and now that it's restricting invites, it will only get better.

3. Due to the huge amount of content and users, some of the rarer stuff is not well-seeded.

There has been over 1 million registered users at IPT. If you go to the welcome forum/thread and click a new user you will see his username is over 1 million.  IPT also now sells invites to people wanting to join the site which I find to be very strange as basically every other torrent site frowns upon user's selling their invites.  

I am not saying there is 1 million active users on IPT, but there's definitely more than most sites even allow in the user database.  IPT has been running for 7-8 years which is pretty amazing considering how much money those site admins make off all their sites you would think they'd be a huge target for MPAA, RIAA and po ditty.  But some how, they manage to not be?  I find this very strange.  

The owners of IPT also own TorrentDay(IPT and TD are 100% run on the same server) and I believe they also own TorrentLeech and maybe some other sites I don't know about.(I know they autoupload to The Pirate Bay, you can find TvTeam which is their autoupload bot on IPT on TPB). The admins of IPT are also selling invites to ""top site access"" which I know isn't real top site access and is basically just a dump that they are selling access to and releases are auto traded there.  

I kind of feel like IPT may be run by feds or have some sort of connection to police.  It's very hard for me to believe a site can openly sell invites to anyone, be around 8 years, have over a million users, ask for donations constantly and also sell ""top site"" accunts and not be shut down.  So many smaller sites have gotten busted for such small and stupid shit, but IPT is the hub of ""private"" piracy.  

Someone have a discussion with me on this or shed some light on something maybe I'm missing.

I switch the source to 'media' and select 'movies'. I can then play the snatched movies/TV shows in the comfort of my lounge-room instead of at the desk on a laptop.

Do other people also do this?

It's great, but I've learnt that the TV will only play .avi and .mkv files (not mp4 etc) at a correct resolution. This limits the files I can torrent.  I can usually find a good copy eventually through public trackers, however an appropriate newly uploaded file usually won't be present.

Has anyone got any tips or tricks that they do, if they do the same thing? I'm also looking for a great private torrent site for movies/TV series. Does anyone know a great site that will commonly have .avi files at good quality?

And if this is already a popular post that I've missed, just let me know and I'll go there.

I've finally decided that that just won't cut it anymore, and so I'm looking to get a slot with a seedbox.

I've looked at **FeralHosting, Whatbox, and Bytesized**, as well as a few others.  I'm really considering one of those three though because they seem to have a good support community and solid reputations.

What I'm looking for:

- Something that's **easy to use**.  Minimal setup, maybe tutorials, etc.  Like I said this is my first seedbox so ease of use is a huge plus.
- Something with a good amount of disk space.  Ideally in the range of **350-500GB** or more.

Those are my two main priorities.  Beyond that, higher upload cap is definitely nice, and I'm looking for at least 100Mbps speeds.  I realize a little give and take may be necessary, but hopefully this gives a clear picture of what is most important to me.  My ideal price is **in the neighborhood of $25**.  I would prefer not to go above $30, but if it's around there I'll consider it.

So, any ideas?  Thoughts on bytesized, whatbox, feral?  Again, ease of use/setup is extremely important to me, as a first timer.  (In that vein, any general seedbox advice is also very much appreciated!)  Oh and I'm on a Mac if that makes any difference.

I have used many seedboxes over the last year and had settled with Evoboxes. Since they merged with Rapidspeeds, I am noticing poorer performance and more downtime (such as my VPS is more or less off line right now). I am interested in what other seedboxes people are out there using right now and are happy with?

I am currently on a 1gbit 600gb 2 gb Ram semi dedicated VPS which I pay about £40 for. I would be looking for similar but prefer to go on peoples recommendations.

**edit:** I should add, I need the ability to install openvpn onto the VPS.

They will have to answer a few questions (nothing drastic) and maybe a question or two about their gaming habits in general but overall we are looking to expand our user-base a bit and get more activity which is obviously a good thing!  So if you know anyone who wants an account or has been seeking an account here, or even if they just like playing games and want to join a great community, I invite all of you to let them know about our new IRC channel in hopes of becoming a member!
