I don't have any decent before pictures, but I was always skinny-fat as a child and young adult. I was about 180-190 pounds at 6'1"" when I started training in earnest, but had no discernible muscle, except for some natural thigh development. At my heaviest, competing in strongman, I got up to 290. I'm currently at 240 and holding steady.
You can see lots of videos of me lifting at http://www.youtube.com/user/Blenderate
This is what I looked like just prior to my last powerlifting competition, at 240 lbs.: http://i.imgur.com/3zZqg.jpg

**Age?** 33

**Sex?** Male


**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

I've competed in amateur strongman and raw powerlifting. I'm currently retired from competition due to problems with my left elbow. I broke it when I was 10 years old, and have had several surgeries to keep it functioning correctly. I had bone spurs removed in 2009, but they've grown back and now it's difficult to do any heavy upper body lifting without aggravating it. Eventually I will probably need to have another surgery. However, I still lift at least 4 times per week, plus do other exercise in between. I find ways to work around my injuries.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan**?

I'm a total geek. I've been a software developer my whole career. I could see the kind of body working at a desk and eating junk food was leading me towards, and I wanted to change. I didn't participate in any sports as a child. I did take a weight training class during my junior year of high school, but then didn't pick it up again until I was 22. I started off doing bodybuilding stuff, trying to improve my body composition and appearance, and then moved into strength sports quickly because I loved lifting heavy stuff.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

All lifts are raw: Squat 315x42, 405x26, 462x20 Squat 672 (305 kg) Bench 429 (195 kg) Deadlift 688 (312.5 kg)

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I've done more programs than I can remember. I get bored easily, and I'm curious by nature, so I'm always changing programs and tweaking parameters. A few of the programs that I've followed:

Westside: Good for equipped powerlifting. The whole philosophy is based around improving performance by bringing up weak points. I'm not sure if I buy into that completely. I don't like the box squat for powerlifting unless you're doing a very specific style of equipped squatting. I actually think it might be better for other athletes, football, hockey, etc., in order to train their hip extension power.

* Sheiko
: This is kind of the opposite of Westside. The philosophy is based around training specific movements and getting stronger by improving skill in those movements. Bringing up individual muscles is a far lower priority. I lean more towards this type of training for powerlifting, because I feel like it's just like any other sport: to be good at it, you have to practice it frequently.

* Doggcrapp
: Excellent for somebody who wants to dual-focus in hypertrophy and strength. Can be very emotionally taxing because of the requirement to always add weight or reps every session. Not for beginners.
Smolov: This is a squat peaking program. I did my biggest squat ever after doing the 4-week base mesocycle. However, I don't like Smolov as written. Or any program based on percentages of 1RM. This is because a given percentage of 1RM is going to have a different difficulty for different lifters. Especially for advanced versus intermediate lifters. An intermediate guy might be able to do 85% for 5 reps, but an advanced guy is going to find that very difficult if not impossible. I have some ideas for how to improve the program, which I will eventually write about.

* 
Super-high frequency, aka Bulgarian/Broz/Chinese oly training: I think this is a good way to get strong fast, but my intuition tells me that it can age your body faster. Olympic lifters tend to burn out in their late 20s, but powerlifters, who usually only train heavy 3-4 times per week, can remain competitive in their 40s and 50s. There are a number of possible explanations for that, but I think the type of super-heavy super-high frequency training that oly lifters use is a contributing factor.

* 
Crossfit: A lot of the criticisms are valid, but there's still a ton of good stuff there. Let me put it this way: if somebody is doing Crossfit and enjoying it, I'm not going to try to dissuade them. Their much better off than people who run on treadmills for 5 hours per week. Crossfit is also becoming a sport in its own right, so to be good at Crossfit competitions, you have to train for it. And as soon as it's a sport and no longer just a training program, it's very hard to be critical of it.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Like my training, I've done a lot of experimentation and tweaking with my diet. I eat differently depending on my goals.

When trying to gain muscle, I've eaten 5000-7000 calories and 400-500 grams of protein every day for weeks on end. I didn't have meals. I would just start eating as soon as a I woke up, continue eating at my desk all day long, and not stop until my head hit the pillow.

When cutting fat or maintaining body composition (which is the majority of the time), I eat a basically low-carb Paleo diet. My holy trinity is meat, eggs, and vegetables. I supplement these with some protein powder, nuts, and occasionally fruit and starch after training.

I like intermittent fasting, if for no other reason than it helps me to control my massive hunger.
I've probably tried over a hundred different supplements. The ones that I've settled on for a good while now are just creatine monohydrate, fish oil, vitamin D, and BCAAs.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**
Over the long term, the absolute most important traits for athletic success are consistency and ability to exert effort. I will bet on a man training hard and consistently but using a crappy program over somebody using an optimized program but doing it half-assed every time.

**What challenges do you face?**

I've had many injuries and other health problems, but the biggest challenge I face is just motivating myself to do what I know is right and best. I'm not a lazy person. I can work very very hard when the conditions are right, but even just getting my ass into the gym can be a struggle some days.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I have so much to learn about motivation that it would be hubris for me to give advice. I'm happy to learn from anybody who wants to teach me. :)

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

My wife has always been supportive of anything I want to do (except, she's telling me right now, my use of the ""suicide grip"" on bench press to easy my elbow pain). She's my best friend and my best training partner. I'm very lucky to have her.
As far as other people are concerned, if I'm doing something I enjoy and not hurting anybody, who can be critical of that? Such criticisms are almost always rooted in insecurities and the need to bring successful people down to an equal level.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Obviously, scientific studies are the best way of figuring out what works and doesn't. But I think too often Redditors fail to recognize the limitations of science. Scientific progress is slow and expensive, and its coverage is narrow. There's a wealth of anecdotal evidence out there that can be harnessed, but you have to learn to have a healthy skepticism and a willingness to experiment to see what works for you.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I got really great gains in the bench from following a protocol of a fast set of 3 with bands, alternated with a heavy set of 3 with straight weight. Something like this:
155+bands x 3 300x3 155+bands x 3 310x3 155+bands x 3 315x3 155+bands x 3 320x3 155+bands x 3 325x2
I almost always have used straps for my deadlift training. I don't see any point to tearing up my hands unnecessarily. Assuming chalk use and a decent bar, very few people are limited by grip strength. Some training without straps will still be necessary to make sure you're conditioned properly for competition.
And, I think the hook grip is superior to the matched grip for deadlifts for almost every lifter.

**What injuries have you dealt with?**
Too many to remember. Many many muscle strains. I have a herniated L4-L5 disc that has bothered me for years. And of course, my severe left elbow arthritis and bone spurs.

**What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

One semantic problem that I often see is that people don't distinguish clearly between health and fitness. While it's true that improving one's fitness will generally improve one's health, this only holds up to a point. After that, improving fitness further actually decreases health. Such is the conundrum of being an advanced athlete. So, you need to be clear on your goals. If you're just doing this for health's sake, there's no need to try to squat 700 pounds. If you're doing it for the sake of competition or achievement, that's fine too, but you need to recognize that there's a trade-off involved.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Uh, wow, there are so many. For diet, I like Robb Wolf, John Berardi, Martin Berkham, and Jonny Bowden. For fitness goals... well, it depends on the goal.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjnO53yPhw

I've been wanting to write down for a while why I love them and why I personally feel they should be an integral part of everyone's programming as I am full on Kool-Aid dunk on the fact that heavy TGUs are one of the best full body exercises around and nearly as such as heavy DLs. Now hear me out first before you say that's a load of tripe. However, I really am not a great writer, so please be kind.

I've been doing them for a bit over a year with a 44lb KB. I found they come pretty naturally to me, so I started doing a lot of them for workouts: 30 mins at a time, 60 mins at a time, do 30 before the rest of my KB workout, etc. I always heard poeple say, ""Ya, it's a great core workout"" and I would think to myself, ""It's a hellofa lot more than that!"" It got me thinking about why they would say only that and realized by doing so many, I began to notice that I was completely fried at the end. I felt like my whole body was toast. Most people either don't do enough of them or they are not doing them heavy enough.

Well, I got tired of having to do 50 TGUs to get the benefits, so I started using the DBs at my gym to go heavier and the effect was immediate. Heavy is better. Wow, did I feel it all over. So what did I feel all over? Read on to find out...

Benefits (in no particular order after Shoulder):


* **Low 'Volume'**: I do at most 20 reps total and I'm wiped.
* **Shoulder Health**: The benefits of shoulder packing are pretty well known. [Here is a great article from Bret Contreras' site.](http://bretcontreras.com/2010/05/guest-blog-shoulder-packing-by-joe-sansalone/). This should also have carry over to any shoulder press movements in addition to strengthening the entire joint.
* **Core**: Yes, they were right. Your core gets trashed. Sitting up and in the intermediate stage, you are really using your core for stability.
* **Strength**: The TGU is really like 5 exercises in one (in progression): Floor Press, Weighted Situp, Weighted Plank, Weighted Lunge/Split Squat/Squat, and overall isometric hold. The more weight you do with each, obviously you will get stronger.
* **Focus**: A TGU takes ~30 secs to perform. Far longer than pretty much every other dynamic exercise. Concentrating on each part of the movement while holding heavy, face crushing metal above your head really helps you focus. As I pointed out to a couple people yesterday, I didn't even notice the crappy music or a guy who walked very near me on one of my sets. All I cared about was not dumping the bell and completing my lift safely. By the end, there is very much will power and concentration needed to fight your fatigue and finish properly.
* **Proprioception**: When all you're looking at is the heavy bell over your face while performing a series of complex movements, you become very aware of each part of your body and where it's at and where it needs to go. How any slight adjustment affects what you're doing becomes immediately clear.
* **Balance**: This pretty much speaks for it self. Try doing it without any weight and get up. Now imagine with a heavy weight in your hand. Any derivation from a proper path and you will dump the bell and/or fall over.
* **Flexibility**: You *will* learn to bend in the right ways and in a slow and controlled fashion to do a heavy TGU. 
* **Time under tension (on body)**: All that time under tension really puts a strain on your connective tissue (from your wrist right down to your toes) and I'm going to go a step further and say also your bones (but that's part of 'Things I Believe but Can't Prove'). Everyone knows that muscles get strong fast, connective tissue does not. Doing TGUs will help strain and heal your ligaments and tendons in a way most quick and dynamic exercises do not, strain over time. I would also dare say it's a safer way to strengthen them since it's pretty much isometric.
* **Time under tension (on CVS)**: If your not breathing hard after a heavy TGU, you must be one bad mother.  Spend 30 secs under real strain and your heart will thank you (While you may hate it).
* **Grip**: You will feel it in your forearm and wrist. You are crushing the bell to hold it in place. Your wrist is preventing any lateral movements. They are doing them at the same time for a prolonged period. Your grip will get tired by the end.
* **Confidence**: What can I say, there is no feeling like standing up from the ground with 100 lbs over your head...

So there you have it. Why I think you all should be doing Heavy TGUs. I would like to add one caveat:

*Do not go heavier than 45 lbs until you are rock solid with a TGU*. 

There are many ways to fuck up and if I hadn't done 100s of TGUs before starting dumbells, I would be dumping the bell left and right. Beside dumping the bell, you can really hurt yourself if you are careless.

However, that being said, if you do it right and check your ego, TGU is plenty safe and will provide you with a multitude of benefits.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_gzl1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/gzl1o/why_you_should_be_doing_the_turkish_getup_and_in/,

**Age? Sex?**

&gt;23/F

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

&gt;I’ve been involved in practically every sport at some point, but my primary focus right now is powerlifting.

**Do you compete at any level?**

&gt;Not yet!

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

&gt;Until a little over a year ago, my idea of exercise consisted of cycling and occasional swimming. In terms of fitness, I was average, and since I’m not the kind of person who is content with settling into the fat part of a bell curve, I decided to “get in shape”. I started by reading a text on personal training and browsing some online forums (but not this one, unfortunately), where I learned how critical building muscle mass via strength training is for, well, everything.

&gt;I was immediately drawn to the challenge of lifting heavy, so I started messing around with barbells, going off of what I learned from textbooks and some training manuals I found at the library. When I stopped seeing linear progress I messed around with PHAT for a while, some aspects of which I’ve carried over to the assistance work I do nowadays.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

&gt;[225x2 Deadlift](http://youtu.be/lSjzjz9wYJs?t=1m17s)

&gt;Goal: reach an Elite total of 703 (250s/170b/321d) before I turn 25 (a little over a year from now…).  I’d also like to give Olympic style lifting a try and enter an amateur Figure competition eventually.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

&gt;I’m currently following Wendler’s 5/3/1 (I’m so original!). I like it because it’s simple and effective while allowing enough time &amp; energy for creativity with assistance work, specifically the targeted BB stuff I do occasionally. I’ve also always been a fan of Bret Contreras’s work, and I’ve been doing barbell hip thrusts regularly for a while now. They are awesome.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

&gt;My diet is composed mainly of colorful vegetables, lean protein, and limited whole grains. Generally I aim to eat 180-200 grams of protein a day. I follow a loose 14/10 IF protocol, take daily creatine, whey, fish oil, Vit D, E, and BCAAs when fasted training, EC when cutting.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

&gt;[Most recent numbers](http://i.imgur.com/WGFLO.png)

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

&gt;3 things: Consistency, Tenacity, and Humility. In other words, keep at it, never give in, and don’t be stupid.

**What challenges do you face?**

&gt;I struggle with the Consistency portion of that triad. I love to challenge myself, so it can be hard to stick with something once I’ve gotten comfortable doing it.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

&gt;The most effective motivational tool is to set clear, realistically achievable goals and expectations for oneself. So, I try to do that. I also try to laugh at my failures. The end goal should always be to feel awesome that you’re doing something you love, even if you’re not seeing the kind of progress you want. That’s not always easy to keep in mind though when you’re constantly trying to be your best, so I struggle with this a lot.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

&gt;Lifting has become an integral part of who I am. It’s a huge source of confidence, pride, and joy in my life. So when people close to me put it down, it can feel like a rejection of who I am as a person. I try to just ignore it, but it definitely gets under my skin sometimes.

&gt;I’ve also found it challenging to date when the majority of my limited free time is spent at the gym or researching and blogging. But for all other social responsibilities, I’m pretty good at keeping things balanced. Enjoying a beer with a good friend or joining my family for a carb-heavy Italian feast is always more important that BF% or whatnot.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

&gt;I ignore guru-ism and anecdotal tips if they are given in absolutes. Everything else I consider worth giving a shot.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

&gt;Endurance cardio promotes suicidal thoughts.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

&gt;Not really. I’m not nearly advanced enough to think creatively about training.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

&gt;If your gym “doesn’t allow chalk”, Mammut makes pretty decent liquid chalk. It’s real chalk powder suspended in an alcohol-based gel that stays on and doesn’t get everywhere.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

&gt;I have all kinds of issues with my left foot due to multiple sprains/pulls/hairline fractures from my days playing contact sports. Luckily, I’ve learned to recognize the feeling right before I’m about to do something that will re-injure or exacerbate it, so I can bail when necessary.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

&gt;Listen to your body. Egos heal faster than tendons.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

&gt;I have a [blog](http://swolesister.wordpress.com/), which is basically a training log with some recipes, psychology research, and personal anecdotes thrown in. I also make fun of stock images. It’s kind of interesting, if you want to check it out.

**Anything else you want to add?**

&gt;Soapbox time!

&gt;I believe that physical strength is achieved primarily via strength of character and strength of will. It takes serious balls to walk up to the bar alone for the first time in a sea of swole and max out at double digits. Somebody holding your hand through the entire process won’t motivate you to grind out that last rep or to keep squatting week after week even though you had to deload to novice weight because your form is abysmal. 

&gt;This is why dedicated weightlifters are some of the most secure, confident people I’ve met, and why I love the community so much. It’s also why things like CrossFit and “body pump” annoy me.

Ugh, the videos really show how fat I've gotten, but here you go. Eight of the nine lifts in one video. Sorry, but I didn't have the time to edit it, but there is not too much fluff.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wpwhnNaU-g

**The Stats**

* 104kg weigh in
* 7 successful lifts
* Squat: 145kg/319.5lbs; 150kg/330.5lbs *(PR)*; **157.5kg/347lbs *(PR)***
* Bench: 127.5kg/281lbs *(two reds)* , **132.5kg/292lbs**, 137.5kg/303lbs *(fail)*
* Deadlift: 167.5kg/369lbs, 177.5kg/391lbs *(PR)*, **190kg/419lbs *(PR)***
* Total: 480kg/1056lbs

**The Experience**

One word: Amazing

I initially was going to enter the 220 class, but decided for a few reasons to go in the 242 class. 

* I didn't feel like losing 5-6 lb (I know, lazy)
* I didn't feel like driving to AC at 5am. Instead, I left at 9am and got there at 11:30am
* It was not going to make a difference in me winning or losing, so might as well just enjoy the afternoon

I'm so glad I did the afternoon session. There were only 8 guys in the entire flight and only one guy younger than me (who won best overall lifter with 722.5kgs) and everyone was awesome and helpful:

* I met John Bogart: WR setter in March for 275lb with a 750lb bench. I got to help him warmup by holding a 2-board for him on bench while he 'warmed-up' with like 600lbs for a couple reps.  He hit a PR of 760lbs. On my first bench video, he's the one with the red suit on walking around with arms out.  Those things are tight!
* I met Stan Chatis: 74yr old multiple world and american record holder. *(He set another American record in DL)* Talk about old man strength! Outlifted me in all three lifts. He's the one you can hear on my last DL video cheering me on.
* I met Doug Currance: Part of the USA World Team (along with the two guys above)
* I saw a collegiate bench press record and also an American Masters II squat record (Doug).
* Several other awesome guys with experience who helped me calm my nerves and have fun.

**How it went down**

I got up early *(4 year old)*, but I had gone to bed at 9pm the night before and took a sleeping pill to really get a good night's sleep. First breakfast was only two scoops of ON, 5g of creatine, 4g of beta-alanine and two scoops of [Green Vibrance](http://www.vibranthealth.us/?p2=/modules/vibranthealth/product.jsp&amp;id=27&amp;category=52) all mixed together in a shaker and I made myself a 3 shot Cafe Americano.

We hit the road and stopped for some food halfway there and I grabbed a Vente from Burntbucks to power myself later.

We got there and speant a little time trying to find the ballroom and found it during the final couple rounds of the morning sessions DL's and was good to see how it was working and [the set up](http://i.imgur.com/dP9MD.jpg).

It was very organized and the setup was very well presented. They had software that showed the lifters, had the timers, the attempts and how to rack the weight for the helpers.

They asked us to find our rack heights before we signed in so I went to found those with the help of guy who loads the bars and signed-in and got weighed *(so fat)*. I had 90 mins so I ate a sandwich...

About 40 mins before, some guys started warming up and said it's better to do so before the rules meeting because there won't be much time after, so I started my dynamic exercises to get a little sweat going (Goblet squats, mounatin climbers and jumping jacks). I also downed another 1.5 scoops of ON mixed with coffee. Then hit the bars for a typical 1 RM warmup. My last warmup was a single at 305...then the stage.

I was really nervous but luckily, I wasn't the first one out. I was second. I picked an opener that was 5lb below my last 1RM because I knew I was beyond that but I didn't want to fail. They called my name, I grabbed chalk like pro and walked out. It was actually pretty easy to zone out the people watching. Stepped under the bar, squatted and got three white lights. Woohoo! That wasn't so bad.

I picked only 5lbs more than my last 1RM for second because in the past that 10 lbs from easy to fail has happened, so I wanted to at least set a PR. Well, I came up with so much speed the bar came off my shoulders and bounced onto the boney part of my neck. You can see it in the video. That was really hurting me yesterday and still bruised now.

Since that went so well, I had a pie in the sky target of 345 when I came in so I went for 347 and nailed it easily. I probably had 10-15 lbs at least in me and my confidence was way high now. I'm gonna kill the bench!

There was a 20 min rest between squat and bench

The warmup area had only two bars, but with only a few lifters it was not so bad. The bench portion was a bit hectic as the number of guys doubled so I started off my warmup's with pushups before hitting the 200s for a few reps.

I think my last warm-up (275) was a little too close to my opener (281) and that may have fatigued me. I nailed the opener easy, but pulled a boneheaded move and failed to wait for the 'rack' command.

This kind of through me and unsettled some of my confidence. I had planned to go for 300 on second attempt, but now I needed a lift to stay in the meet. *(official total, I mean)* So I picked 292 and got it, but I could tell my energy was draining a bit. Probably coming down form the initial high. I was going back and trying to eat some snickers and coffee but I think it was too late. 303lb was a bust but at least I got my bench in.

Another 20 mins for DL warmups

Again, for DL I picked a 5lb less than 1RM for opener because I've been having trouble breaking it last couple months, but I pull 315 double overhand in warm-up like it was cake and decided that was good enough warm-up.  

My mind was slipping and I forgot to snap my belt on opener but it was easy. Like squat, I just wanted a PR so I went for 391lb *(I think I should have done 400+)*. It was easy. So I went for a big jump to 418 on last one and nailed it. Happy with a big new PR, but wanting to keep trying higher! I'm in the zone, folks, lemme PR more!

**What I learned**

* I'm now a powerlifting junkie. 
* Strategizing the *(only)* three lifts needs more work.
* My confidence is high and my once goal of 300/400/500 is now 400/500/600.
* I have broken through mental barriers on squat and DL and my belief levels are sky high
* I feel happy there is something I can compete in again since the glory days of H.S.
* Met some awesome guys
* I'm too fat :op

So, that's it. I hope you guys find this worth the read...

We have suffered long during this winter of discontent and the silence has been deafening.  For too long r/advancedfitness has been left to wither; limping its way into obscurity and disuse.  

No more.  

Like the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes, so too will r/advancedfitness be reborn anew.  The mod team would like to encourage and invite all of you to be a part of this rebirth, and help us craft AF into the mighty force for good we all know it can and should be.  

Before I get into the changes we’re looking to unveil, I want to take a moment to reiterate what this sub is supposed to be about.  

r/advancedfitness is a place to learn, teach, and share information on the myriad ways we all work to improve our health and fitness, and achieve our training goals.  AF is the clear signal that rises above the noise of r/fitness.  Our subject and user bases are broad and we recognize there is no One True Way^TM to see results.  We are open-minded and thoughtful.  We are evidence based, and we recognize that knowledge and evidence come from [various sources]( http://bretcontreras.com/2011/08/a-scientific-approach-to-fitness/).  We are not solely a weightlifting reddit, nor shall this sub be devoid of that or any other content.  This is a place for timely and coherent discussions about issues in health, fitness, nutrition, and exercise. 

In short, if you want to see posts and comments relevant to your passion, you need to create posts relevant to your passion.  Ultimately, the content of this subreddit is determined by you and your posts **and we want to see those posts.**  

Please do not get hung up on the ‘advanced’ in r/advancesfitness.  If you’re reading this you’re already on the A-Team.  We’re all here to learn and to improve ourselves, whether we are just starting out or have years of experience.  However, that is not to say that all content will be welcomed and embraced, and this *is* where the mods will be upholding the ‘advanced’ criteria.  Although the info in the side bar needs some updating, the following [post criteria still stands](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/AdvancedFitness):

&gt;Inappropriate Topics (not a complete list) 

&gt;* How do I start working out, lose weight, gain muscle, tone up, etc. Those should be in [/r/Fitness](/r/fitness) (only *after* reading their [FAQ]( http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) 
* Rage/f7u12/meme comics 
* ""Lack of motivation"" threads 
* Karma whoring 

Remember: more signal, less noise.

The mods reserve the right to remove any post for any reason, but we also want the community to be self policing through the vote arrows.  Please remember proper [reddiquette]( http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette).  Just because you don’t care about yoga doesn’t mean you should downvote a post about it.  

To start off the changes, **starting immediately AF will now be allowing link posts** in addition to the self posts.  Please use your best judgment in ensuring they are appropriate for this sub.  To help get the ball (and the content) rolling, we are offering a short-term allowance for reposts.  **This is not an open call for karma whoring** - suspected violators will be dealt with appropriately.  This is a call for those pages you have bookmarked that are still as good today as the first time you read them.  This allowance is to share your favorite resources with those who may be unaware or who have missed them the first time.  Remember, *we want quality not quantity*.  

In the coming weeks we hope to unveil more features.  The member spotlight posts will become regular again with an occasional ‘spotlight redux’ to check in with previous honorees.  We’ll be looking to create some interactive challenges both here and in our [Fitocracy group]( http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8091/).  The sidebar will be updated with new content and we will be reaching out to other subs to form partnerships and a network of fitness-focused subs.  If you have other ideas on how to make this a better sub, please feel free to share them.

**Age?** 23 **Sex?** Female

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

Weightlifting, swimming, equestrian sports and a variety of other things, but primarily Olympic weightlifting - I haven't competed yet, though I intend to do a meet or two one day. I'd love to be coached/handled, but there aren't any athletic clubs where I live, and a severe scarcity of knowledgeable strength training people. I plan on getting back into the equestrian scene eventually, as I used to compete in the show rings and cross-country courses... probably never doing a swim meet again though, screw those starting block heart attacks.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

My dad, Max, was a pro-level bodybuilder. He won the Mr. Austria title at eighteen, and continued to compete through much of my young life. At 6’4 and 305, his stature demanded attention, and he worked hard for it. As a result, I’ve been in gyms since I was a kid. At ten years old, I was drinking protein shakes to be like daddy, and at sixteen I joined the swim team, only to soon realize that I liked being in the gym more than being in the pool.

After a bout of teenage stupidrexia that left me 95lbs and miserable, I started trying to actually understand fitness. I read sassy, smart articles from the strong women of [Stumptuous](http://www.stumptuous.com/), and gradually began to grasp the idea that lifting weights wouldn’t instantly turn me into the Hulk like my dad. I gained a foundation in proper form, persistence and consistency from him (or as he would say, ""she got her OCD from me.""), and went off to college basking in the glow of having overpowered the wild, rampant misinformation on how the body works. I got my nutrition in order and started gaining healthy muscle mass, though the process was slow.

On March 24th, 2007, two police officers came to my dorm room and told me that my dad had been killed on his motorcycle, and I would be flying home to my mom and brother the next day. For those who know what it’s like to lose your hero, someone you love and look up to desperately, you may understand, for those who don’t, you can’t possibly imagine. Everything in my nineteen-year-old world came to a halt, except my workouts. I’ve seen a squat rack through the blur of tears more times than I care to admit. I became a regular on his fitness board, where everyone who had loved and admired him showered me with positive reinforcement and accurate advice. I dug up his posts about weight training, supplements, and competition diets, and with inspiration from the old pros, I dove into Mark Rippetoe’s Starting Strength, or as I like to call it ""El Bible"" (BEE-blay). It was a snowball of dedication from there on out. I turned into something of an addict, and became rather isolated (forever alone: gymrat edition). The iron was my truest friend. I depended on it for stability, for pain, anger and fear management; instead of becoming an alcoholic or going into therapy for my grief, I did weights. I even scheduled classes around the times I wanted to train, usually morning/early afternoon to dodge the crowds, and I’ve been kicked out of several gyms (read: health spas or fitness chains) around my city, because they don’t want their members becoming liabilities by actually lifting the big plates. It’s a right shame that chalk is almost never legal.

With help from the members of my dad’s fitness forum, I found a friendly, diverse gym that allowed me to store my own set of bumper plates so I could train my Olympic style lifts without anyone getting in my face about it. As such, I feel somewhat lucky that most people at Impact accept and even encourage me. Every other week someone asks me if I’m competing… [I’ve even been in their commercial!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0dznU10Dtc) (:22 clumsy jerk with the absurd red socks) While I’ve relaxed my obsession and eased my depression with the help of cannabis to allow a tame social life, my dedication and actual love of weightlifting hasn’t waned. Many a time as I’m walking through the gym I’ve thought to myself, ""I’ll never let this go. I know for sure that I’m going to be doing this always.""

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?** 

Hmm, at this point in my life, I'm not sure I have any immediate goals for my training. I'm going to be lifting all my life, whether I have a goal in mind or not. But I suppose as any good weightlifter should desire, I want to increase my strength as much as I can while maintaining or decreasing my body weight.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Three to four days a week of weightlifting preceded by a dynamic cardio warmup. Cardio isn’t my focus, but it has its place and I’d be remiss if I left it out entirely. I get bored easily with cardio, so I like to mix in the occasional swimming, cycling, rock climbing, etc. As far as my lifting routine, I train lifts, not muscles, and I've been following a linear progression model (like the [Bill Starr 5×5](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Bill_Starr_5x5)) for a few years now; it's the most reliable program I've found. Depending on how I feel and where I am in my training cycle I alternate my focus on different lifts. I pretty much let myself snatch and C&amp;J (the Olympic lifts) all I want barring their interference with my other lifts.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I typically follow a Paleo-ish diet composed primarily of lean meats, colorful vegetables, nuts, eggs, sprouted grains, oats and whey/casein protein (often considered a supplement). No starchy/yeasty carbs, preservatives, refined sugar, mystery meat, or fried shit on a stick for this machine. I also limit dairy, gluten, and salt, and I never drink calories, which means the word ""diet"" on any labels, and Splenda in my tea – deal with it. (Everything else is liquid candy, except booze, which is toxic sludge.) I buy fresh fish and vegetables about every week and apply some form of heat to them. (Cooking really isn’t that baffling or difficult.) I cook often, eat out seldom, prep meals in advance and drink a metric fuck-ton of water. I can actually be quite the food-elitist; if it’s mass-produced like the stuff you get from most fast food chains or restaurants, the quality is usually low and my organs are too good for it. 

The basic rule I follow is to focus carbohydrate intake (both complex and simple) around workouts and mornings. I won’t pretend that I’ve put myself through any real hardcore pre-competition dieting, as I tend to keep it simple with food – no calorie counting, or food scales, or “today I had seven almonds for a snack”, just proper macronutrient timing and quality above all else. On that note, I feel as though it wouldn't be terrible difficult for me to try out a contest prep diet.

As for supplements, I take all the basic stuff that I think a lot, if not most people should include in their diets for various reasons. Apart from the aforementioned whey/casein proteins, I also include a standard multi, EFA oil (essential fatty acids), joint supplement (glucosamine-chondroitin/MSM), green phyters, some kidney/liver support, BCAAs, vitamin D3, B12 and antioxidants among others. My CEE (creatine ethyl ester) cycles in and out… but usually in. I also use Glucorell-R before a carb-heavy meal to blunt insulin response and utilize the carbohydrates efficiently.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?** 

Height: 5’4.5 Weight: 135-145lbs

Current 1RMs 

Squat: 245lbs 

Bench Press: 155lbs 

Deadlift: 250lbs 

Clean &amp; Jerk: 165lbs 

Snatch: 125lbs

**What challenges do you face?** 

Being a young female in the weight room has been a challenge. Hell, being someone who lifts heavy in general NOT as ""supplementation training for football"" has been a pain in the ass, especially when the only gyms available would rather have old/sick/dead members who never actually come to the gym to dirty up the equipment but always pay their dues. Yeah, I've been hit on, ogled and hassled in the past by idiots with big egos and tiny nutsacks - psh, a GIRL doesn't know squat form better than ME! - but that has largely dissipated as I've grown and gotten stronger/confident. The proof is in the big plates and big legs.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I don't really need motivation. I love weightlifting. In fact, I can get pretty pissy if I’m forced to skip too many days. I feel like I’m losing my conditioning and entering into endorphin withdrawal. It seems to me, however, that if you’re not motivated enough, then you don’t want it badly enough. If you want it, you’ll make it a priority, make it a habit; if you see it as a chore, you’ll get lazy and make excuses. I think it’s difficult for some because the reward mechanism isn’t 
usually immediate. Consistency is key to making any sort of progress.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

Not too many naysayers - a lot of average gym-goers seem to enjoy watching me lift, and what friends I've retained just seem to accept lifting as something I do. Haha, nearly every SO I've had within the past several years has become self-motivated to workout, or at the very least has come to watch me lift. I'm not sure if they feel emasculated, are trying to keep up with me, or just picked up on my habits, but it's pertinent to note that I tend toward variety, and I realize that my dedication to the gym is somewhat a-typical. The most obnoxious thing is probably my peers' desires to drink or stay awake until 2am for no reason. Not tonight, dude, workout in the morning.
(Note: this doesn't mean I'm boring and never party, I'm just moderate. And I prefer venues other than the stereotypical clubs, and substances other than the stereotypical alcohol. So there.)

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I only take advice from people who obviously have more experience than I do in strength athleticism... those who lift what I want to lift or look how I want to look. Smart old pros with a sort of knowing swagger are my favorite people. :) I tend to avoid anyone my age, or those guys who totally used to bench 405 in high school, but then got a shoulder injury...

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Knowing something is true without being able to prove it sounds a lot like ignorance or faith to me, and I don't do faith. Anything that has scientific basis (like the biology of the human body) can be proven with enough research. There are no real mysteries when it comes to fitness and strength.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Pulled/twisted/strained muscles and crackling joints are the only problems I've had. They've been minimal, as my emphasis on adequate warmups and near perfect form has prevented any serious injuries. Those horrifying weightlifting accident videos you see generally have a 1% chance of actually happening if you're doing it right.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Proper form is utterly necessary. Joint supplements and The Grid foam roller are fantastic aids, but my default procedure for dealing with any injury is the acronym R.I.C.E. - rest, ice, compression, elevation.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I like the old school shit by Mark Rippetoe... can't really go wrong there. [T-Nation](http://www.t-nation.com/) usually has some pretty sensible articles, once you wade through the advertising. The forum I got my start on is the [Anafit Board](http://www.afboard.com/forum/)... plenty of knowledgeable people available there for a civil discussion on fitness. Oh, and I also recommend [APT Pro Gear](http://www.prowriststraps.com/) for equipment; the website sucks, but they have good prices on the necessary stuff.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

Everyone loves pictures: [Here's my dad at the last competition he did](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y57/kaleidovisi0n/Daddy/DADDY.jpg). [This is what he looked like off-season](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y57/kaleidovisi0n/Daddy/lucy005.jpg?t=1303844256).

Coming off an injury and totally changing my game plan (I couldn't kick with my right leg because of injury). 

I would also normally use running to aid my weight loss but couldn't even run. I dialed in my nutrition going pretty strict low carb, high protein Paleo + cottage cheese and whey. 

To make up for not being able to run I did spin classes, swimming, biking... even skipping on one leg and to allow myself to train hard I switched stance from orthodox to south paw. This was by far the biggest change as anyone who does fight sports should know, its both mentally and physically confusing. 

But it all paid off! I made the weight (lost roughly 10 pounds) and won the fight!

1363930259.0,64,self.AdvancedFitness,1as9h5,"Series on Soft Tissue Work, Ep. 1: Primer",75,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1as9h5/series_on_soft_tissue_work_ep_1_primer/,"This is the first installment of a series of articles/videos that will present safe and effective soft tissue techniques, geared particularly towards athletes and their coaches and training partners. Be sure to check your local laws and regulations concerning massage and soft tissue manipulation before using any of these techniques, and especially before charging for them. I won’t be held responsible if you get in trouble for doing the work without a license.

**A Few Words on Safety:**

It’s surprisingly easy to fuck somebody up with massage. A thorough knowledge of anatomy is vital for the safety of all involved parties. In particular, you’re going to want to avoid the flexion side of most joint spaces, locations where delicate nerves and large blood vessels run close to the surface with little protection. Places like the popliteal fossa, femoral triangle, sternal notch, anterior/posterior triangles of the neck, cubital area, medial brachium and axilla, etc. If you don’t know where those locations are or what runs through them, you need to familiarize yourself before continuing. There are also a number of structures that are easy to injure in nonpermanent but still really annoying ways. Structures like bursas. Bursitis is a bitch, but not all bursas are vulnerable to massage. I’ll try to guide you away from the ones that don’t respond well when I present on that area of the body.

Furthermore, deeper is not always better. As a matter of fact, you want to use the minimum force possible to accomplish your goal (and everything you do should be done with a specific goal in mind). That may be a great deal of force or it may be as light as a feather on the skin, depending on where you’re working and what you’re trying to do. Massage puts stress on the body, so it needs to be done with training load in mind. It’s hard to pull off a PR when you’re still recovering from the session with your therapist.

Finally, I will not be held responsible if you hurt yourself or someone else using the techniques shown in this series. There are a lot of partial and total contraindications for massage: cancer, infection, rash, osteoporosis, open wounds, diminished sensation, painkillers, alcohol, etc. If you’re at all in doubt as to your abilities or what you’re working on, don’t fucking touch it.

**Massage vs. Manual Therapy:**

There is an increasing propensity for massage therapists of varying levels of training to identify themselves professionally as manual therapists. While technically true, manual therapy as performed by a physical therapist or other professional is typically regarded as requiring more advanced training than most massage therapists have received and is more strongly evidence-based in its practice. The difficulty is that massage therapy is an enormously diverse field and massage therapists that specialize in the more technical work have few other ways of distinguishing themselves from Reiki practitioners and the like.  Pretty much everything I am going to show in this series can be considered both massage and manual therapy and I may use the terms interchangeably. I just ask that you don’t misrepresent yourselves in performing any of these techniques.

**A Brief Overview of Systems:**

There are a buttload of massage systems out there, an issue made more problematic by the trademarking of system names and techniques. A result of this is that there are a number of systems that operate on the same principles with very similar techniques but have very different names. To help you be an educated consumer, I’m going to briefly describe the types of systems that are most useful and the names they are commonly known by.

*Deep Tissue:*

This name means nothing other than the therapist has learned to lower their table and push hard. Hundreds of different techniques fall under this umbrella and it’s only really useful for distinguishing between techniques within a system. If a therapist tells you they “specialize in deep tissue” don’t let them touch you.

*Myofascial Release:*

This is any type of bodywork designed to release myofascial restrictions to improve somatic function. It’s also a term used in place of therapeutic massage when someone wants to sound technical. Some complete systems have been built around it, including Rolfing and its spin-off Structural Integration. Both are effective to a degree, but are overpriced and overrated. This is a better indicator of training than “deep tissue” but it’s still pretty buzzwordy.

*Sports Massage:*

Sports massage is any massage technique performed with the intent of improving sport performance or recovery. As such, everything in this series (and much more) can be considered sports massage. It is generally divided into different types of sessions based on when it is done relative to the athlete’s performance or training, or the athlete’s physical state. Sessions are typically focused on either immediate event preparation/recovery, maintenance, or treatment of chronic injury. Not all massage therapists are trained in all of the objectives of sports massage.

Russian sports massage is very systematic and comprehensive, and it forms the framework of my own massage protocols. Russian sports massage is primarily geared towards maintenance and recovery, but is modular to accommodate event or injury treatment objectives. Even then, a proper Russian sports massage will almost always be full-body, with the injury treated separately after the general massage or pre/post event techniques interspersed in the general massage. Has a reputation of being one of the best researched massage systems in existence. Sometimes known for never using forearm or elbow techniques.

*Trigger Point Therapy:*

This is a common and basic system built around relieving myofascial trigger points (sometimes called “knots”) through ischemic compression, friction, and stretching. “Knot” is a vague and largely useless term, as it doesn’t precisely describe what is going on in the tissue. A trigger point is characterized by a few distinct traits:

* Tender/sensitive, before, during, or after palpation
* Palpable, like a grain of rice in a ball of putty
* Referred pain, always along predictable pathways
* Increased, disorganized collagen deposition

A successful treatment requires a significant knowledge of functional anatomy, advanced palpation skills, and knowledge of pain referral zones for the musculature being treated. Any trigger point therapy presented in this series will be incidental and not comprehensive.

Trigger point therapy serves as the foundation for Neuromuscular Therapy. NMT is a much more complete system of treatment and is more suitable to specialize in than a single tool like trigger point therapy. (As an aside, I’ve never met someone certified in NMT who didn’t really know their stuff.)

*PNF/CRAC Stretching:*

Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation is a system developed to treat neuromotor dysfunction, and the Contract-Relax or Contract-Relax-Antagonist-Contract stretches are part of the larger system of treatment. These techniques fall under the umbrella of muscle energy techniques, where the muscle being treated is contracted against resistance, then goes through active range of motion, at the limits of which a stretch is manually applied. These techniques are characterized by active movement on the part of the recipient and recruitment of proprioceptive reflexes. Also known as Active Isolated Stretching, Post-Isometric Relaxation, and fucking magic. Can tax recovery systems dramatically.

*Positional Release Technique:*

This technique peaked in popularity over the last few years with ATC’s and PT’s, but it is in my opinion overrated. The technique operates off the principle that after some insult to the muscle, guarding tension, and its associated pain, can be relieved by manually shortening the injured tissue to interrupt the vicious cycle of tension and pain. You can think of it as a more advanced way of holding what hurts to make it hurt less. It’s useful in acute injury or with active trigger points where muscle guarding is preventing the therapist from doing more meaningful work. But there are many other ways to accomplish this, often in a shorter time. Some consider PRT a derivative of techniques in NMT.

*ART/STR/Tack and Floss/Pin and Stretch:*

Active assistive techniques operate on the principle of restricting specific layers of tissues, then taking involved joints through a specific range of motion (usually active, but sometimes passive) while maintaining the restriction. Tack and Floss (popularized by Kelly Starrett’s voodoo band stuff) is less targeted than ART or STR, as it’s done with an elastic band rather than manually, while Pin and Stretch techniques often involve passive ROM. These techniques can have a very powerful effect in resolving somatic dysfunction, and as such, the bulk of techniques that I demonstrate in upcoming videos will be based in these systems.

*IASTM/AStym/Graston/Gua-Sha:*

All forms of Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Manipulation, these techniques are performed by placing the target tissue on a stretch, then abrading the area with a blunt bladed tool, often stopping when the skin is too compromised to continue. The research is all over the place, with conflicts of interest everywhere you look, but a lot of pros swear by it. Certification and tools can run anywhere from fifty bucks to several thousands of dollars (looking at you, Graston...) but you can get by with the back edge of a butter knife and some tiger balm. These are incredibly popular lately, but they’re not the be-all, end-all of soft tissue treatments.

*Swedish Massage:*

This is a term that describes the generic fluff-n-buff with maybe occasional deeper techniques, typical of a basic massage in a spa. Originally it was a fairly comprehensive system, until it became fashionable and the training stateside was bastardized into what it is now. This is typically the first system most massage students learn, as it requires the least technical knowledge. Not typically something I would recommend for athletes, but it can be useful for overtrained or highly stressed individuals. I will not be demonstrating any of it.

*Shiatsu/Thai Yoga Massage:*

These systems involve rocking, non-gliding strokes along the lines of the body and a good deal of partner-assisted passive stretches. It’s like having yoga done to you. Can be very relaxing or invigorating, and is great for maintaining mobility. Occasionally I might pull a technique or two from this, but probably not very often, at least in this series.

Alright, so the meet is over!  First, before I give the report, I need to say thanks to some people:

* [Scottydog28](http://www.reddit.com/user/scottydog28): Talking me leading up to the meet, making sure I was prepared/wasn’t forgetting anything, general advice, etc.
* [Abeawastaken]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jk9r8/member_spotlight_abeawastaken/): Double-checked and gave advice on water loading/cutting weight/rehydrating.  Considering I was 55.9kg, I don’t think I would have made weight without him.
* [Suppy](http://www.reddit.com/user/suppy): Frozen pop-tarts.  If you haven’t tried them, they’re amazing.  I used them as carbs the day before and they tasted even better this way.  I know it doesn’t seem like a lot, but when you’re ready to destroy something for a bit of water, anything helps, and this did.  Also, the cold from the pop-tarts made me think I was getting a bit hydrated.
* [Zahrada](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zahrada): Bench press recommendation of Smolov Jr.  Probably the single biggest factor I noticed during the meet.
* [Silverhydra](http://www.reddit.com/user/silverhydra): Damn good nutritional and supplement advice.  He made cutting (actual) weight and keeping performance easier/possible.
* Everyone else – I’m sure there’s people I’m forgetting, but these stick out right away (and I’m tired).  The support was astounding and definitely helped.

So, needless to say, the meet went really well.  Actually, it went much better than expected, by far.  Cutting weight was a pain in the ass and I was literally dying for water come Thursday night.  Abeawastaken gave me some awesome advice for water loading and it definitely paid off.  I ended up eating some carbs and water Thursday after I compared my scale to the meet scale.  I feel like this contributed tons to my lifts.  If I went into the meet without those carbs (mmm, pop-tarts) I doubt I would have had the energy I did.  Rehydration went well.  I had some pedialyte, water, beef jerky, coffee, and a ‘coffee roll’ (read: more like cinnamon roll) from the local coffee shop.

Warm-ups for squat went pretty well.  I did 135 and it felt like nothing, 185 was similar, and 225 felt fast.  275 was slower, but I knew I could get 308.  When I got 308, I didn’t realize it’d be that fast.  I kept to my game plan with squats of 5kg increases because I had to sink them.  I got white lights for 319 and 330.  330 was interesting because it felt like I *almost* paused at the bottom but it was just really slow at the bottom.  If I didn’t sink them as deep, I could have gone heavier, but I’d rather go light and get what I needed.  After going 3/3 on squats, I was pumped for bench.

Warm-ups for bench were solid.  Everything was going fast on and had no issues.  I went into my opener with no idea what would happen.  I did Smolov Jr. on Zahrada’s recommendation and it really paid off.  181 flew up pretty fast.  I wasn’t sure how 192 was going to feel so I decided to stick with the plan and do a 5kg increase.  When that flew up, I knew 203 would be too easy, so I went to 209 (95kg) and got it without much difficulty.  Had I known it was going to be that easy, I would have gone to 215 instead.  But hey, that’s *definitely* a meet PR by almost 20 lbs.

Deadlifts!  My favorite lift of all.  I did my usual warm-ups and they felt good.  I put in 407 as my opener which is something I was confident I would get (as I did 2x415 the week prior).  That went faster than expected.  I was debating during warm-ups between doing 440 instead of 418 for my second attempt and I succumbed to my weight greed.  I put 200kg in for my 2nd attempt (with the intent of not doing a 3rd if I got it).  200kg/440lbs went up better than expected.  I knew it wasn’t a max, but I figured hey, I just went 8 for 8 … I could try a 3rd attempt, but I risk injuring myself.  I already hit my goal of qualifying, set PRs, didn’t miss a lift, etc. so I figured stop before something bad happens.  Apparently, I hit a 981 lb total and raw elite is 984 … had I known that, I would have put in a 3rd attempt, ha ha.  Oh well, just gotta go elite at the Arnold in 2012.

So, there’s the cliff notes of the past several days of misery and elation.  Given the chance again, I probably wouldn’t change anything because this was, bar-none, the best meet I’ve ever done.  I’d like to sincerely thank everyone for their support, you have no idea how much it means to me.  I was checking the FCJ between squat/bench/deadlift and it really motivated me, made me smile a lot, and pushed me knowing there were people out there watching what I was doing.  Awards are later tonight and I’m gonna see what I need to do to submit my entry for the Arnold … I’m really looking forward to that.  If anyone goes, let me know!  Other than that, I guess this is kind of an AMA now or something.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I currently compete as an amateur Strongman (about to enter my 4th contest in October) I hope to compete in my first Raw Powerlifting meet in the next few months. I'm also interested in finding a Olympic lifting coach at some point.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I come from big people, my mother being Italian and my father being Samoan. Even though I was a fat kid, I always played and excelled in sports. The summer going into freshmen year of high school my parents decided to get me a personal trainer to help me shed some weight for fear that I would get diabetes/gout (which runs in my family.) Flash forward to high school, I fell in love with the weight room. I was the strongest kid at my school as a freshman, breaking 4 of the 5 weight room records. I lost a ton of weight. By junior year I lettered in Football, Wrestling and Track &amp; Field (discus and shot put), was 223lbs at my lightest (not sure what my BF% was, but I did have visible abs without flexing.) I was talking to some coaches from some D1 and D2 colleges, and had some full ride scholarship opportunities...

Then the shit hit the fan. For the purpose of length I'll run through this...

* Broke an ankle during a summer pick up game of football. It was misdiagnosed as a Type 2 sprain. Trained on it. 3 month later the pain was so bad I went back to the doctor and found out it was actually broken and I had destroyed my ankle and needed surgery...no senior year sports. Lost all my scholarship opps.
* Dad lost his job and family business wasn't doing so great.
* Broke up with girlfriend of 5 years.
* Started partying hard (alcohol and drugs)
* Get a call from my Mom 2 month into my 2nd year at college. She tells me she has cancer. She passes on shortly after.
* Dad loses his shit and turns to the bottle.
* I leave college to take care of our family business and my pops.

I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror, and was shocked. I was huge fat ass, with drug induced raccoon eyes. After some thought, I realized that I’d have to find a sport if I wanted to get back in shape. It was the only way I could think of keeping myself accountable. I had done one (“mickey mouse”) strongman contest in high school that was held at a local junior college and came in 2nd place. So, I did some research online and found my coach. Shot him an email asking if I could train with him, and after a few months and a lot of hard work trying to prove myself, he took me under his wing.

Things got a little better...then my pops fell into foreclosure.

When I saw the foreclosure notice, something clicked in my head. I refused to let my father be 60 and homeless. I refused to let life beat me down. I refused to be weak. So, I pulled myself up by the proverbial boot straps and aggressively started build our family business. I took on 2 weekend jobs to prove to the bank that we could pay our mortgage. I felt unstoppable. I was happy again, but I was still fat. So on December 27th, 2010 I decided to lose the weight. As of August 1st, I'm 46 down lbs. and I got my father out of foreclosure :)

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

**Goal Body Weight** 250lbs (reevaluate from there.)

**Strength Goal**

* 3xBW Squat &amp; Deadlift
* 2xBW Bench
* 1.5xBW OHP

**Athletic Goals**

*Short Term*

* Place top 3 at a Silver or Gold level Strongman contest.
* Total elite at my first Raw PL meet.

*Long Term*

* Place top 3 at a Platinum Plus level strongman contest (/Pro Card)
* Total over 2000 at a Raw PL meet, preferably around 250lbs.
* Start competing in Olympic Weightlifting on the local level.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I would like to train 4 days a week, but due to work constraints (7 days a week / 75-80 hours) I can only train three. I do a 2 day split, upper and lower body, and 1 day for strongman events.

I have enough experience and a world class coach, so my programming is all over the place. Typically programs run for 6-8 (sometimes 12) weeks and pull from...

* The West Side Conjugate Method for strength and speed
* The Bulgarian Method for slight strength gains and work capacity
* Big Sac(ramento) Crew Method. Its unpublished but was put together by the old school Sacramento/Richmond Strongman Crew my coach was a part of. Its great for conditioning and work capacity.
5/3/1 for deloading

This may look confusing, but it works for whatever I'm feeling weak in.

I’m currently flirting with the idea of adding some of my old football conditioning work back into my training to help speed along the weight loss. I wasn’t planning on doing this until I was into the 200s, but then I thought, “What the hell, you ran when you were a little fat fuck freshmen, why not run now?” This would include Hill Sprints, Stadium Stairs, Ladder and Dot drills, and some Combine Drills.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

The best way to describe my diet is Low carb. I try to stay &lt;100g on non training days, and &lt;200g on training days. I stay &lt;2500 calories a day. If it's not water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea I don't drink it. This has worked up until the last few months, and I’ve kind of hit a plateau (I’ve only lost 3 lbs in the last 2 ½ months ;( ). Anyone think they can help me out?

I eat clean from Sunday to Friday (4:59pm), then between Friday (5pm) and Saturday (midnight) i'm allowed 2 cheat meals. Dessert and Alcohol count as a cheat meal. Example: A steak diner is not a cheat. If I have a couple beers with my steak, that’s 1 cheat. If I have ice cream after that, then that’s 2 cheats and i'm done until next week. If I plan on going out with friends, then I eat clean and just drink as my cheat.

Supps:

* Whey
* Fish Oil
* Multi
* Fiber

I don't put much stock into supplements, but I do notice that the fish oil has help a lot.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

(All Raw)

Bench - 345lbs

Dead - 705lbs

Squat - 635lbs (have not taken a true squat max yet. This weight was quick, fast, and pretty = Not a 1rm)

OHP - 315lbs

40in box jump @ 365+ (did it 9 months ago as a bet. Not bad for a fatass)****

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

**On Competition:**

""Remember, the most important thing is to have fun! And what could possibly be more fun than winning?"" - Coach O (Meaning, playing around is great, but if you’re in a competition and you don't mind losing or give it your all, you're wasting your time.)

On Training:

""You want science and studies? Fuck you, I've got scars and blood and vomit."" - Jim Wendler

**What challenges do you face?**

Working 3 jobs (75-80 hours a week). I'm tired all the time and the stress takes its toll.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I try to remember what it was like to be awful.

When shit got tough, I would throw the most amazing pity parties ever. Shit up my nose and a tear in my beer. My head wasn’t right. I thought someone owned me something. That’s fuckin’ bullshit. My ancestors would be spinning in their fucking grave if they heard some of the horseshit that would float through my head. Luckily, I kind of figured it out: “Abel, you are acting like a bitch, and you are fucking soft. Now, what are you going to do about it?”

So, once I got my head right, the training thing just made sense. Knocking off the drug use made sense. Just like the saving up some money to go back to school makes sense. The same way broadening my horizons and stepping out of my comfort zone makes sense...I’m starting to ramble, so the mantra I’ve used, which I think sums up the whole “motivation” thing is this:

Being weak of mind and body is unacceptable.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I'll take advice from anyone that is/was better than me. ""Better"" is also relative, and not defined by noncontextual numbers. For example, someone who hasn't ever deadlifted but read about them from a book can't tell me shit. Someone who is 160 and deading 500+ can give me all the advice in the world and I'll listen because even though the weight they're pulling is less than my own, it's still amazing for their size.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Slow, isolated, concentration work is pointless in regards to strength training. It might be great for hypertrophy, but useless for strength.

Potstickers are the ultimate food. They have the perfect balance of Protein to Fat to Carb ratio. Also, potstickers provide many essential vitamins, namely M, S, and G...

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

As a child I've had arthroscopic surgery on my right knee to repair my MCL. I broke my right ring finger and it healed all screwy (I always know when it's going to rain when my figure starts throbing lol.) Also had my ankle surgery. They all hurt once in a while, but ice keeps everything in check. Pec and Bicep tears are huge in strongman, but if you listen to your body everything should be fine.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Listen to your body. Only you know what works and doesn't.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

1360349554.0,63,self.AdvancedFitness,1859as,The L-Sit and the Lower Traps,69,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1859as/the_lsit_and_the_lower_traps/,"A lot of people, especially desk bound people and weightlifters, are really upper trap dominant. Working the lower traps is not something that's normally done. Yes, the top of a pullup should pull the shoulder blades down with the lower traps, but due to this typical weakness, this part of the movement isn't done because the lower traps can't handle the full load of your bodyweight yet.

## Enter: the humble **Floor L-sit**

A lot of people attempt or try the L-seat, and do so on an elevated surface, thinking of this movement as a ab and hip flexor movement. It certainly is, but learning it on the floor improves lower trap pressing strength, because you will need to press downward hard to lift your legs off the ground.

If you can do an L-sit on PBs, rings, or chairs, try this: sit down on the ground and push up into an L-sit. Could you even lift off the ground? Probably not. Now, tuck your legs in so you're seated with your feet flat on the ground. Use your feet to assist and push yourself up with your hands. I'll bet you lifted yourself a few inches higher than when you attempted the floor L-sit.

The issue here is the same as with the pullup - you cannot handle your full bodyweight load. So to train this, we scale it back.

## But how do I train it?

My preferred method to teach the L-sit is [here](http://i.imgur.com/psDyW.png) (this image is taken from the [Monkey Gym Wrist Mobility, Bodyline Exercises, Handstands Guide](http://www.allthingsgym.com/2012/09/wrist-mobility-bodyline-exercises-handstands-guide/)). Gold Medal Bodies [also has a decent tutorial](http://www.goldmedalbodies.com/how-to-do-an-l-sit/).

## Why post this here?

Lower trap weakness causes some types of shoulder pain. It's a good idea to balance the shoulder girdle, and the lower traps are one of the hardest things to hit (doing shrugs from a pullup bar will work)

&gt; Women have far more problems dieting than men usually. 

&gt; Once a woman ""cheats"" on her diet well, it's Katy bar the door.  Shit is about to get real.  Women fall off the wagon and then proceed to lie in the mud, crying and sobbing about how they fucked up and blew their diet while stuffing half a cheese cake into their beak.  


Jamie Lewis has said similar when asked why he won't coach women in dieting

&gt; Women have a psychological attachment to food. Meaning no disrespect to women (for once in my life), I think they need a psychologist more than a nutritionist for dieting. Because I have no idea how to break that emotional attachment, and it alternately amuses and horrifies me, the refeeds derail their diets every fucking time. 

&gt;Thus, they’re either dieting, or they’re eating like shit. There’s no in between. I can’t be bothered to deal with that. (Laughs)

I wanted to see if there was evidence to support this or if it's just a common misconception.  I know that I see women do it far more than men, and I don't think I've ever seen a woman I know break her diet for only one meal/snack/day (excluding reddit, of course).  Every time it happens, breaking the diet seems to be a several day event, or they'll quit entirely.

So, I found [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828901) that showed 29% of women quit vs 14% of men (that is what they mean by attrition, right?).

I also found [this](http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0278-6133.19.Suppl1.5) but can't get a full text, not sure if it will include gender anyway.

[This study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306460386900390) says women were more successful in maintaining weight loss

Can anyone find any other research on the subject, both for losing and maintaining weight loss? I couldn't find very much and a lot of what I did find didn't have a full text available.

* ** Age?**


Just turned 21 (last Valentine's Day).

* ** Sex?**


Male.

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?
**

At the moment, all I do is go to the gym. I am not specialized in anything. I merely use the gym as a vehicle to test nutritional theories of body composition.

* **What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**


I started out a fat, basement dwelling MMORPG otaku/nerd; then suddenly, football.

I started out playing for a city league, then eventually played for a school league as well; then I added a provincial league in as the third concurrent football team I played on. As a lineman too.

I started in the gym on a basic 'Powerbodybuilding' program in my third season, as my trainer called it (In retrospect, he was just trying to get me to shut up and lift since I couldn't decide between being pretty and being strong). Just a 5x5 program consisting of squat --&gt; bench --&gt; deadlift --&gt; OHP --&gt; Bent-over Row; done once a week to not impair with football much.

After that, it was just a snowball effect. I slowly backed out of football when I overtrained (dropped the school league, voluntarily became a back-up at provincial) and started gymming more. My studying of nutrition and my gym experiences just feed off each other, further fuelled my new PRs and new landmarks on my body (such as being over 200lbs and under 10% BF)

* ** What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Currently my only set goal is to rehab my damn shoulder. Beyond that I have no goals as I am too near-sighted. I would like to Bridge Press more than 400 in the next few months and Glute Bridge over 800 this summer though. Sometime in the next year or so I want to pull 600 from the floor (Currently my numbers for those three are 385,705, and 515)

* ** What is your workout or training regimen? Feel free to provide as much detail as you want.**

It recently underwent a change:

Day 1: Legs

Day 2: Vertical push/pull

Day 3: Horizontal push/pull

Day 4: Arm hypertrophy, rehab, mobility work

I start every workout with an exercise that I must be fresh for (Overhead Squat, Bridge Press, Deadlift, etc.), which is usually done for strength and with a barbell. My next exercise is done with DBs or something more joint friendly for volume (Usually 10x10, but not GVT timing). Then I do what feels good after that.

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I'm going to get sooooo much flak for this section...

Waking up to stimulants and leucine.

Fasting until 3pm or so.

Break my fast with workout nutrition (250-500kcal of glucose and 500kcal whey protein, alongside beta-alanine, creatine, leucine (all 15g), 2g DMAE, cinnamon, potassium, salt).

Afterwards I head to get my postworkout meal of 2-3 big crunches from KFC (depending on how much I can stuff my face with), a medium diet coke, and some sort of chocolately treat. I wash all this down with a protein shake with a veggie extract and metamucil so it comes out fine.

Later on I have 6-12 raw eggs in a shaker bottle with a scoop of protein and more veggie extract, some more metamucil later by itself.

If I were to go shopping and make either borscht or chili, it would replace the fast food meal; during these times my fat mass drops drastically, but it isn't as fun.

As for supplements, there are:
The above ones in my workout nutrition.

Supplements to avoid deficiencies; Vitamin D, Magnesium, Zinc, Potassium, Fish oil, Metamucil, choline, etc. (At the end of the day I meet all nutrient needs, despite the diet looking like shit)

And some extras: Caffeine (either Lo-carb Monster or Jack3d) and ephedrine. Sometimes I go Black Widow on the fat burner. I have some Chromium, Garlic Extract, B-complex, Aniracetram, Vinpocetine, Rhodiola Rosea, Bromelain (those two taken pre-workout) Piracetam, which sucks; and some B-phenylethylamine. I recently shipped to my home some mitochondrial support from LEF (Mostly CoQ10 and Quercetin) to test out in the future.

God damn it this is going to be a fun section to talk about :D

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Currently around 210-215 at 5'10 and sub 10% body fat, more precise numbers not known.

Bench Press is 360 and Bridge Press is 385

Deadlift is 515, Trap bar deadlift is 515x3

Back squat is 445 (Have not even done this in about a year), and Glute bridge is 705. I have also high box squatted (box set an inch above parallel) over 750 beltless, so yay core!

Other notable weight achievements are my insanity sets (where safety and logic are thrown out the window when my mind blanks), where I have trap bar deadlifted 415x23, DB Rowed 130x53, and Bench pressed 275x14. All belted and the Rows strapped as well.

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

My philosophy outside of the gym is that ""The better I do in the gym, the stronger I am, the better I look, and the more studied I become; the less likely I will need to get a regular 9-5 hellhole job in the future when I leave this prison called University""

In the gym, my mind just blanks and I lift heavy shit while slowly, day by day, becoming more canine than human around weights.

* **What challenges do you face?**

My own stupidity. I rarely rest and I push my rehab to the limits (hurt shoulder? Okay then, I'll just push my bridge press from 315 to 385 in 2 months time since, you know, I'm not crippled yet)

Intellectually, sitting in a room full of dietetic students who admonish ketones, fasting, saturated fats; and either cannot think critically or will be looked down upon if they do.

Seriously, guys... All the markers of diabetes and heart disease are positively correlated and caused by dietary carbohydrates, why the fuck are you limiting carb intake to 50%. You just said you can stay out of ketosis with as little as 20%; DO THAT THEN FUCKERS
End rant :D

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

Music. I have pretty much every genre on my Ipod and every now and then a song just hits me. Usually my best Insanity sets are done when a song makes my entire body flush with adrenaline; I have not done an insanity set without a song fuelling me to do so.

Name dropping [touhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) here as all, literally all, my music is either original or remixed [touhou](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5hoqShV6w8&amp;feature=related) songs.

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

Family and friends are understanding, strangers who criticize feel the full wrath of the hydra.

* **What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take a lot of advice, but I usually ignore advice on rest. Due to my stupidity. This is also a reason I consciously added in rehab and mobility days, as to not kill myself over time.

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I have a boner for fucoxanthine, despite it having very little human studies done on it. I swear that choline supplementation per-workout makes you a god and allows quicker CNS (Central Nervous System) recovery, I'm pretty damn sure that the more calories you shove in your face and digest during a workout, the better, and that you can NOT overtrain unless you are working out 2-3 times a day with a subpar diet, over a period of months. (This may be rescinded when you olympic lift 400lbs for 2-a-days).

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

My periworkout supplementation is pretty unique. I get a lot of idea's from Biotest's [Anaconda Protocol](http://www.t-nation.com/anaconda2.jsp), but I have not heard of other people modifying the ingredient list. They just seem to either use it or criticize it.


* **Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

If you intermittent fast. Your first 'pulse' of the day is a bunch of stimulants (EC + yohimbine) with some green tea and leucine. The next time you pulse (2 hours later) it is fish oil and fucoxanthine. repeat this process 2-3 times.

Try to gain fat and lose muscle while doing this; you won't be able to.

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Insanity sets bring huge injury potential, either from actually undertaking the set (hence why I belt up for all of them), or from getting so much hypertrophy that your muscles become unbalanced. (Which has contributed to what I have now, insanity sets on bench and cable crossovers while ditching the DB rows has possibly led to internal impingement and reduced thoracic mobility)
I've only dealt with easily rehabable injuries; a partially torn hamstring, this shoulder injury now, forearm strains. My only scary one was when I tried to do my 1,000,000lb Incline Leg Press volume challenge and, at the quarter way mark, suffered a cerebral contusion from high blood pressure.

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Nope, sorry; I'm stupid when it comes to these things and my advice would only be bad. Bows down to troublesome and fish oils
Belt up though, always belt up when going maximal. If you can keep good form and a sound mind when going 'max', you are not going max.

**My Training:** I've been lifting for just over three years now, but the first 1.5 years were heavily fuckarounditis and the last six months were the first real time in my training life that I've done anything resembling a ""program."" I've done 5-6 cycles of 5/3/1 and since december, at the advice of Blenderate, I decided to do the squat workout twice a week, with additional squats on deadlift day for assistance work. (Thank you Blenderate.) This was because my squat has been seriously lacking, and thinking back to this time last year, I could barely put up 315lb on a good day. What I called ""PRs"" then were probably high, and at a much higher bodyweight. The reason for all this squatting was that my squat sucked ass compared to my other lifts and was really holding back my projected total. 

For bench I did a lot more close grip and reverse grip bench work towards the end, laying off the weighted dips due to a sore shoulder. I was also incorporating much more pause benching and pin presses as well. Back in November I put up a gym PR of 290lbs at a bodyweight around 160-165lb, feltgoodman.jpg. 

The deadlift. This has always been my strongest lift and because of that since November I've laid off of doing much of it except for when my program called for. I've always switched back and forth between conventional pulling and sumo pulling. For the competition I pulled sumo because as of late my sumo has been very strong without causing much pain or soreness in my lower back that comes from pulling conventional for me; for the record my conventional PR is 455lb. I essentially let the increase in squat frequency and intensity take care of my deadlift knowing that as my squat went up, so would my deadlift, and it did. I also did quite a bit of heavy shrugging and rack pulls as assistance work to make sure the top end of deadlift was strong. 

**The Cut:** First of all, this was terrible. I was miserable. There have been very few times in my life when I have been as miserable as I was this past week. With that being said, I'd do it all over again, and will continue to do so; because glory is a feeling the weak willed, faint of heart, and fearful will never know. 

Back in October to the beginning of November I was regularly weighing in around 165 to 170lb. Towards the end of November and beginning of December it was more like 160 - 165lb. I accomplished this by just eating less bread by switching to low carb tortillas for my lunches which are usually grilled chicken wraps. I also stopped eating as much pizza and other related ""junk."" Once Thanksgiving passed I knew it was time to buckle down. I made a conscious decision to eat less than 100g of carbs a day, with a cheat day about once a week, and started drinking only diet soda instead of other crap. I also stopped eating even less ""junk."" This included less protein bars due to their high carb content (as the low carb ones make me feel like shit because of all the sugar alcohol). 

Now the Saturday before the meet, so one week out, I was weighing a good 158 to 160lbs; that was my last cheat day. I ate stupid shit cause I knew my life was about to be hell.  Sunday began the water flood. Sunday through Wednesday I was drinking around 3 gallons of fluid a day. My food consumption was chicken or beef and broccoli. I would wake up and drink a protein shake for breakfast, about a pound of meat for lunch, and then for dinner about another pound of meat with some broccoli. I stopped eating beef on Tuesday, eating only chicken on Wednesday. My last meal before weigh in was Wednesday evening (48 hour fast). I also cut back drastically on fluids at that time. Thursday morning I woke up at 156lb. That day I cut back my fluid intake to two 15oz Rock Star 2x energy drinks, a Rock Star Lemonade, and 1/2 litre of water. 

Thursday night I did four cycles of hot baths and showers, only getting down to 153lbs. It was at this point in time I decided to get into kill mode to guarantee that I'd make weight. I went to RiteAid and bought some diuretics and laxatives (seeing as I hadn't shit since Tuesday). Took the recommended dosages Thursday night approximately 14 hours before early weigh-ins Friday evening. Went to sleep at 11pm only to wake up at 3am needing to shit. Stayed up so I could go to the steam room and sauna on base at 5:30am. Got to the gym went in the steam room sauna in the following cycle: 15minute steam, 10 minutes out, 15 minutes sauna, 10 minutes out. Repeat three times. When I got home I took another hot shower.  

Got home weighed myself at a somewhat uncomfortable 148.4, not sure that I was in fact safe and lacking all trust in my scale, I still refrained from drinking water and continued to spit all saliva and force myself to piss as much as possible. 

I got to the gym for weigh-ins and made weight at 146.4lb. Fuck. Yes. 

These cutting methods can be much more eloquently detailed and scientifically backed in the following Chaos and Pain blogs. (NSFW Obviously) [Edit: I'd like to thank Jamie for providing the below information as it made this cut a lot easier to do, and obviously made me much more competitive.]

Sure, it was stupid and unsafe; but if you're going to try and lecture me about cutting weight and becoming dehydrated as fuck you can go suck elsewhere. Never once was I faint, light headed, or had severe muscle cramps. I'm an adult, I'l make my own damn decisions. 

[Me at 146.4lb](http://i.imgur.com/TAAFR.jpg)

Oh, and by the way, I woke up Saturday morning 10lb heavier. Lol. 

**The Meet:** This shit was exciting as fuck. I got there and was pumped. My lifting parter (Who I've lifted with all of four times) was there and equally as pumped. Warm ups went nice. I warmed up to a double at 275lb and then got a single at 295lb in the squat.

**Squat:** My opener was 319lb and it flew up. My second squat attempt was in the 340's and it went up pretty well too. Here is my last squat:

[Third Attempt: 374lb Squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PUlo8P6cYQ) This is a PR. I've done a 375lb squat ""to a box"" but that was done at 160lbs bodyweight and the depth, according to Blenderate, ""was questionable."" Looking at the video I feel I buried that last attempt. 

**Bench:** Warmed up and felt great. Got up to a 205lb and a 225lb single warming up and both felt great. My first attempt was 240ish pounds. My second attempt:

[Second Attempt: 264lb Bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMMWy_l-ws) 

This was my best successful attempt. By no means a PR, but after cutting weight, I still felt pretty good about it. Good enough that I for my third attempt I went for the California State Record, tried to get 283lb but the weight only went half way up where it got stuck. Maybe I could have grinded it out in they gym, but the judges weren't having it and called for the spotters. Oh well, next time. 

**Deadlift** Warm ups went well. Worked up to a 405lb single and killed it. My first attempt was 419lb, second attempt was 454lb which felt lighter than the first. I was stoked on that because it was an easy 3x BW deadlift. My third attempt:

[Third Attempt: 473lb Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-tWphimYkI)

This I'll call a PR because the 475lb I did in the gym was at a much higher bodyweight and I hitched it up. This went up so easily that if I were in the state of mind I could have asked the judges for a 4th attempt to go for the 507lb California state record. Oh well, no big deal. Next time it will be mine. 

I ended up winning my weight class which consisted of only two lifters. I beat my competitor by over 100lb though. I got second place for Best Lifter in the Mens Raw Open. Losing that title by a mere 5 points, which, had I finished my third bench attempt I would have also won Best Lifter. Oh well, next time. 

My total was 1,113lb which according to Powerlifting Watches data base ranks me as tied for 48th place in their ""All-Time American Mens Lifter Rankings."" Now, the meet results aren't published yet, but at the end of the meet I spoke with Mr. Dennison and he gave me my total and my wilks score, which was 394.535. I don't have access to the national lifter rankings so I don't know if I am anywhere near those numbers and the USPA doesn't have lifter classifications at this time. But if I were competing in the RAW federation I would be considered a master level lifter, very near elite.

TL;DR- Won my weight class, got second place for best lifter. Didn't set state records. :(

1354126182.0,56,self.AdvancedFitness,13y07a,Carb backloading - just another diet or something special? Let's discuss.,67,11,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/13y07a/carb_backloading_just_another_diet_or_something/,"[Carb backloading](http://www.carbbackloading.com/) is a relatively new diet (might not be new, but the 'revival' of it is) advocating the eating of carbs only after training. Pre-training and off days are very low carb. Carbs eaten after training are to be high-GI, so junk food is encouraged and welcomed.

It sounds like a sham (and the guy's site is pretty market-y), but there are many citations throughout his book. Whether or not they prove what he's claiming is another story.

The problem is there doesn't seem to be a lot of respect for Kiefer from people who matter. Alan Aragon and Lyle Mcdonald, two ""generalist"" nutrition guys (aren't fixated on a single idea) that I respect, both think it's nonsense. I have heard many accusations around the net of him cherry picking studies as well as just blatantly misinterpreting the results of them.

I mean, some of his claims are just flat out ridiculous. ""By including fiber, up to 20 percent of calories from a meal get lost"". Yeah, right. Even if there were some miraculous circumstances by which it's 20%, it's misleading to state it like that..because as it turns out, the average is ~2-3%.

[Here is a fantastic rebuttal about some key studies that Kiefer uses in his book](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149292883).

There are many users of this diet out there that claim they are able to achieve the holy grail of losing fat while gaining muscle. It seems to be popular in powerlifting circles (there is a 35 page thread on the bb.com PL forums), and most seem to enjoy it and report positive results.

Is this just some bro trying to make a buck selling a fad diet, or could there actually be something to it? ",,False,self,t5_2s9km,1354126633.0,,,True,t3_13y07a,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/13y07a/carb_backloading_just_another_diet_or_something/,

**Got any new pics?**
 
No pictures at the moment I’m afraid.  I am currently bulking and retaining a good deal of water weight, not the most flattering.  Since this is my Spotlight, I get to be the asshole that says no new pics.  Here is a pic of me two days out from the [Arnold Sports Festival Raw Challenge](http://i.imgur.com/oIJoW.jpg). 
 
**Have you taken up any new activities since your last spotlight?**
 
Eating.  Actually, in more seriousness, I’ve dropped activities since the last spotlight.  I’m no longer doing steady state cardio, pretty much everything at this point is High Intensity Interval Training.  At this *moment* I’m not doing cardio since I’m running Smolov for squats and I need to recover my legs as much as possible.
 
**What's been going on since your original spotlight?  Any events or activities you’d like to highlight?**
 
Yes, twice actually.  First was at [USAPL Raw Nationals in August 2011 (meet report)]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jo495/meet_report_2011_usapl_raw_nationals_or_how_i/) which qualified me to lift at the [Arnold Sports Festival in March 2012 (meet report)]( http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qgfwa/meet_report_arnold_sports_festival_raw_challenge/).  I was happy with both performances.  At Raw Nationals I pulled 200kg officially for the first time and at the Arnold I finally hit a 155kg squat and elite total (986 lbs @ 120.8 lbs bodyweight).  Also at the Arnold I had a 452 lbs deadlift that was turned down 2-to-1, but I’m not upset about that at all because the last time I had pulled that weight was about 3 months prior at 10 lbs bodyweight heavier, so I was happy that I could even break it off the floor, ha ha.
 
**What are your current goals?**
 
I wish I knew.  I feel at a loss right now.  I know I’d like to get stronger, but that’s about it.  A 405 squat would be nice, getting back to that 240 bench would be sweet, and I’ve switched to sumo stance for deadlift, so the immediate goal there is to sumo pull my conventional deadlift PR.   In terms of conditioning, I need to get my rowing started back up again so there will be a lot of 500m pieces in my future I’m sure. 
 
**Has your training changed since last time? What is your current regimen?**
 
Right now I’m running Smolov so my workout schedule is usually squat and bench every other day with OHP thrown in somewhere.  Deadlifts are taking a break.  Probably the biggest change is that I am no longer focusing on my bodyweight as I do not have any meets planned for the rest of the year.  I plan on going by the mirror for the foreseeable future.  My conditioning has taken a back seat to maximal strength but I think in the long run, that was a bad move and am hoping to re-introduce HIIT (in the form of sprints and rowing) after Smolov.
 
**Has your diet or supplementation changed much?**
 
I’ve reduced my supplementation a good portion.  Now I pretty much just stick to
 
* Multi-vitamin
* Fish oil
* Vitamin D
* Caffeine
 
My diet has lacked the nutritional discipline that would enable me to lift heavier at an ideal bodyweight and bodyfat percentage.  In truth, my nutrition has been holding me back for several years now.  Often I can stick on a diet rather well for a couple weeks but after that I crash and burn into a binge frenzy and in the end, I take 3 steps forward, 2-3 steps back every month.  It’s a cycle that has continued for far too long.
 
**What have you achieved since the last spotlight? What are your ‘numbers’ 
(times, weights, heights, etc)?**
 
I pulled a 450 lbs deadlift on Thanksgiving and unofficially 452 lbs (turned down 2-to-1) at the Arnold Sports Festival (I’m counting it as a +2 lbs *gym* PR).  Additionally, I hit a 240 touch ‘n go bench several months back before injuring my shoulder (during squats nonetheless).   In terms of cardio / conditioning, there’s really been nothing worth mentioning there so I’ll skip that.
 
**How has your training philosophy, attitude and motivation changed over the 
last year?**
 
I was motivated for a very long time about the Arnold Sports Festival Raw Challenge.  After that passed though, I’ve been feeling lost.  I think it’s due to part burn-out and part due to lack of specific long term goals.  I know my ‘goals’ at all times, “be stronger” but that can only take motivation so far.   To be honest, I think I psyched myself up so much for the Arnold that I lost sight of a lot of things.  I transformed powerlifting from something that was part of me into my complete identity.  I achieved what I set out to accomplish there (hit raw elite) and now I feel as if there is a large void within me.  I remember reading TheGreatCthulu’s spotlight where he mentioned that after the Channel swimmers complete their swim, depression becomes common.  I know what I achieved is nowhere in the neighborhood of swimming the English Channel, but I think there is some resemblance.
 
Further, and this is something I’ve been feeling for quite some time now, I have grown not just weary but a strong distaste for the internet with regards to fitness, lifting, and nutrition.  There are so many “gurus” that are (in my opinion of course) full of shit, people that focus on the dumbest bullshit possible (paralysis by analysis) and gimmicks that are clearly a scam.  For several months now I’ve been contemplating deleting myself from the Reddit/Fitocracy/Bodybuilding.com/etc. communities to focus on myself and really learn from myself without the distraction of the internet.  That extends beyond fitness though.
 
As I alluded to earlier, I’ve been feeling a bit burned out and allowed powerlifting to become my sole identity.  Outside of powerlifting, I don’t really have any hobbies (aside from PC gaming on occasion) and I think that’s not mentally healthy.  There are so many things I feel I’ve yet to discover beyond powerlifting that I think I really *need* to discover, explore, accomplish, learn, etc.   Some things off the top of my head:
 
* I’ve been meaning to get my skydiving license for about a year now.
* I really would like to get back into camping, especially ultra-light solo camping
* I’ve put it off far too long but I do need to get treated for binge eating disorder as it has affected not just my lifting, but my personal life, mentally and physically.
* I let powerlifting get in the way of a social life so much that I don’t really have too many local friends to be honest.
* Read books more.  Read anything and everything.  Just read something every day, period.
 
I think I’ve finally reached that “fuck everything” state of mind where I really just don’t care anymore despite what I just mentioned above.   I know it seems paradoxical (don’t care about anything yet want to do so many things) but I believe it is a sign of motivational burn-out.   I think the binge eating plus motivational fatigue and injuries has really created a trifecta to put me in this state of mind and it’ll take a while to get out, and it will most likely be something that I will need external help with.
 
**What new tricks, innovations, and tweaks have you discovered?**
 
I’ve really made some good progress with my *sumo* deadlift after this [Q&amp;A with Wild Iron Gym](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGLcgsUjz4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=157s). Also, for deadlifts, I’ve removed shoes and just go with plain socks or deadlift slippers, thereby reducing my ROM by about 0.5”.
 
**Have you had any injuries since last time, or got over any?**
 
I’ve been dealing with a shoulder injury (I suspect a shoulder impingement) since late December / early January which has brought my bench down from a 240 touch n’ go to 215 on a good day.  During the course of Smolov so far, I’ve developed what seems to be patella tendinitis which has caused some aches in my knees.  I’m trying to finish the base mesocycle without tearing my patella tendon, fun times all around.  I also tweaked my back a couple weeks back when I was deadlifting (I turned my head to the side on accident when I heard a noise, extremely dumb mistaken on my part).  I think the shoulder injury is healing up and I’m keeping an eye on the knee and back. 
 
**Have you discovered any new websites/books/DVDs you want to recommend?**
 
I’m running a blog at [CtrlAltLift.Blogspot.com]( http://ctrlaltlift.blogspot.com/).  Aside from that shameless plug, I’d recommend the following resources:
 
* Alan Aragon’s Research Review
* [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)

**Age?** 27

**Sex?** M

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

Drug free bodybuilding, Golf

**Do you compete at any level?**

Professional Natural Bodybuilding for the NGA and IFPA

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

I always played sports as a kid (basketball, baseball, soccer, football, etc.) but I ended up I playing golf competitively from at age of 11 all the way through college. I played 4 years for my HS varsity team and then 4 years in college. By the time I finished collegiate golf I was burnt out on the sport. I got tired of being a tall skinny guy so I wanted to devote a lot of my time to weight lifting to try and build a body I was proud of. After a few weeks of 5+ days a week in the gym and seeing some great results from noob gains I was hooked.


**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

 Well my goal ever since late July of 2010 was to put on as much lean mass as I could over the course of the next year and a half before I competed again in 2012. I wanted to try and stay at the 11-14% bodyfat range while getting stronger. I’ve managed to go from a stage weight of 192lbs last time I competed to 212.4lbs this morning. I still have visible abs and all my lifts are at personal records so I think I’m on the right track. I hope to hit &gt;215lbs on an am weigh in before beginning my next contest prep at the end of January/beginning of February.


**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I follow Lyle Mcdonald’s generic bulk template with some minor tweaks to fit my personal physique needs. He suggests a 2x upper/2x lower split per week. His whole premise is strength progression. As you are adding weight to the bar your body is going to grow with you over time. He also keeps everything in the 4-6 rep range for the big compound lifts and then 10-12 reps for the remaining exercises. I’ve seen amazing strength gains while following this routine and also have noticed much more thickness because of it.


**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I know people will hate me for this answer but my diet right now is anything goes. My main focus is ample protein daily (250g+) and then a caloric surplus (&gt;4K cals) to help put on weight. I have a super fast metabolism so it takes a lot for me to gain weight and usually my appetite dies out before I eat enough to put on size so it’s been a struggle. This has helped me stay fairly lean during this offseason while still putting on good size. I do not suggest this for everyone.


**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?** 

I won the overall and my NGA pro card at the NGA Natural Mr. California in 2010. I also competed in the 2010 IFPA Pro USA for my professional debut (placed 9th). The IFPA accepts pro cards from all natural organizations so that allowed me to compete with them. I have during this offseason managed to get my big 3 lifts up to 585lbs on deadlifts, 495lbs on squats and 385lbs on bench press. However, I have not tested my 1RM on any of these lifts for months so I suspect its higher now.


**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?** 

Like Lyle says, I’m all about progression. If I’m getting stronger and eating enough then muscle will come with it. When dieting down for a show the macro nutrient intake is the biggest concern. I don’t worry so much about clean foods, I worry about hitting my numbers for the day. But because of this, you tend to gravitate towards cleaner foods because they aren’t so calorie dense. I also try to keep lifting heavy when dieting because the heavier weight stimulates more muscle tissue and your body will want to hold onto muscle a lot more if it needs to than if it doesn’t.


**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I think about being on stage and not winning and that motivates me to continue to push it. I hate to lose.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I surround myself with fitness oriented people. Luckily my gf competes as well. She’s an NPC bikini competitor so she’s in the gym more than I am. It helps to have a SO that sympathizes. Over time my friends have weeded themselves out. Ones that could not understand what I do and why I do it just stopped coming around, and the ones that do are here to stay. I’ve also met many others who are like minded and have similar goals so that helps as well. My family completely supports me so I have not had any hurdles in that sense.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I take evidence-based advice. All other advice I either already know it’s BS or I’ll research it later to find out about it. But something as simple as a suggestion on form/technique in the gym can be tested right there to see if it works the way it’s intended to (ie great muscle activation, better drive, etc.)

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

The mind is what limits your potential. If you believe it, you can achieve it. I can’t really test my mental determination but I know it’s to thank for the majority of my achievements thus far.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I don’t know anyone at my gym that trains upper/lower 2x a week. I only started doing it myself early this year when I got turned onto Lyle’s site (see site url below). Most guys go with the 1 body part per week training method and, until I read about the new training style I use, I had never even heard about someone doing a 2x upper/2x lower split. I had heard of guys hitting legs twice a week to bring them up but never upper body as a whole 2x and that’s it. It sounds absurd until you read more into the details of why it works.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Oh I’ve had plenty of minor injuries but nothing major. I have had plenty of strained muscles, I’ve had a pinched nerve in my quad, I’ve had neck problems and lower back problems. Sadly, this comes with the territory. When lifting heavy weights for years even with proper form, injuries will occur. That’s the downside to bodybuilding. I haven’t gone one day in several years without something being sore.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Learn how to properly warm up and then make sure your form is correct on all your lifts. I had to learn these things both the hard way in my early 20s and after correcting them I’ve had many less problems and also seen my strength go up a lot. I wish I would have learned it sooner but I can’t change that, I just hope others will learn from my mistakes.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I post on bodybuilding.com’s forums a lot for fun and I go to www.bodyrecomposition.com for some great articles. I also read a lot of what Dr. Layne Norton and my coaches at 3D Muscle Journey (www.3dmusclejourney.com) write.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I’ve been a redditor for years and continue to be. I browse the r/fitness section quite a bit and if anyone ever has any questions you can PM me here or on bodybuilding.com (same user name) and I’ll help you out as best I can.

[A couple from last year](http://i.imgur.com/fy8ku.jpg).

[These are from about a month ago](http://i.imgur.com/S1dJo.jpg).

**Age?**

I’ll be 34 next month.

**Sex?**

Male.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Currently the only thing I do is train for competitive powerlifting. My first meet is at the end of the October. Through my teen years and into my mid-20’s I seriously studied (and taught) a martial art known as Kempo. I wrestled in junior high and my freshman year in high school but never took much of an interest in weight training. I hadn’t heard of the word “deadlift” prior to February of this year and might have squatted once in high school.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I’ve been a computer geek my entire life and had the gut to prove it. Even when I was heavily into the marital arts, I ate like crap so I was never “in shape” at any point in my life. In December of last year, my wife and I learned we were expecting our first child. That ended up being the kick in the ass I needed. I was determined to be a strong, superhero dad like I remembered my father being. I refused to be the wheezing, fanny-pack wearing slob who couldn't outrun a two year-old. So, with a friend, I joined a Snap Fitness franchise across the street from my office.

Twice a week and then three times a week, I’d walk/jog on a treadmill for 45 minutes and then do 15 mins worth of curlbro stuff with dumbbells. I was feeling better about myself, but not seeing a lot of progress. A few weeks later, my workout buddy told me about the Medifast diet and how it had worked very well for his mother. I looked into it and then placed an order online. It’s a 1000 kcal/day diet of that consists of six soy-based, prepacked meals. Very brutal. Very effective. I strictly adhered to it for six weeks and went from 265 lbs to 235 lbs.

Then one day, on a whim, I wandered into /r/Fitness and the rest is pretty much history. I quickly discovered SS and decided to try it. So I stopped the diet-in-a-box, but still ate clean and at a deficit. My buddy and I switched to a black iron gym and I’ve been picking up heavy things ever since.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

I’m eventually going to hold the Michigan USAPL records for both squat and deadlifting. However, my immediate goal is to pull 600 lbs. off the floor next month. I might attempt to cut down from the 220 to the 198 lb. weight class next year since I’m still carrying around more body fat than I care to.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

As the weights got heavier, SS plus a caloric deficit got the point that I was murdering my body. I switched over to Wendler’s 5/3/1 for Powerlifting and have done three cycles so far. However, I feel that my body is capable of more than 5/3/1 demands. After my meet, I’ll explore some other options. I don’t want to switch up this close to a competition.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

For months I was extremely anal about my diet: weighing everything and counting every calorie. I’ve gradually relaxed a bit but will likely be reverting since I find it easier to put it on autopilot. If I can con my wife into tracking my macros for me, that’ll be even more awesome.
I think only Silverhydra has put more (legal) chemicals in his body than I have here. I’ve experimented with a lot of stuff, but my current supps are: vitamin D, fish oil, choline, B-complex w/ vitamin C, CoQ10, caffeine + yohimbine, zinc, and magnesium. I half-ass take creatine and beta-alanine when I remember. I also grow my own spirulina algae in a spare fish tank.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Since the beginning of the year, I’ve dropped about 10 inches off my waist. Body weight is down from 265 to 220 +/- 4 lbs. I’m trying to keep it stable and as close to my weight class limit as possible. 
My lift PRs are: 

* 420 SQ 
* 255 BP 
* 545 DL
* 190 OHP. 

I plan to attempt a 585 deadlift this Friday or Saturday and then back off it ahead of the meet.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

Biggest challenge is lack of time. I pieced together a home gym via Craiglist a couple months ago after my beloved black iron gym closed it’s doors and auctioned off everything. Being able to head down into the basement now has made this easier. But I run my own, rapidly growing business and have a newborn daughter. As important as getting down into the gym is to me, some days it just doesn’t happen. That bothers me, but I think it’s good that it bothers me.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I’m past the point that I need constant motivation to get my ass in the gym. I like lifting and don’t see that changing; I get pissy and restless if I go more than a few days without it. Knowing that I’m “training” rather than just “working out” is all that I need to keep doing it.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don’t have any naysayers. The only “challenging person” in my life that affects my training is my five-week daughter who cries more than edubation does about his bench press.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I listen to everyone, but I always have my BS filter active. In that regard, it’s not a whole lot different than dealing with people in the IT industry all day.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Preworkout carbs impair my performance. I don’t know why, but they do. I’ve found that in general, my body prefers a low-carb diet.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

In my basement, next to my power cage is my computer desk. I have a camcorder on a tripod with a Firewire cable permanently plugged into the back of my PC. I record nearly every lift I do and review myself while resting between sets. It’s an old habit from my competitive martial arts days and I find it extremely helpful.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Pretty minor stuff, but I’m also still new at the game. My first week in the gym, I managed a 360 lb. deadlift, but pulled an adductor doing it. I strained my neck with poor OHP form that resulted in me walking around like Frankenstein’s monster for a week. And I popped something in my back that dropped me to the floor during a DL caused by leaning forward too far on a squat. Nothing that took more than a three weeks to bounce back from though.

As far as my philosophy: I’ve discovered that I have an unusual natural strength in my lower body that’s well-suited to powerlifting. I feel obligated to myself to see how far I can take it. Part of that is accepting ahead of time that I will injure myself at some point, possibly severely. It’ll suck, but I don’t have a physical job and I do have good health insurance so it won’t be the end of the road. At elite levels, powerlifting largely becomes about who has the highest pain tolerance. I know what I’m getting myself into. I hope.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

When I first learned of foam rollers, I wrote it off in the same category as yoga balls and pink dumbbells. I’m a believer now. If you don’t own one, get one and use it regularly.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I barely have enough time to train, much less to read about it. To be honest, I’m kinda over the whole research and debate thing that originally got me hooked on Fittit. I’d rather lift than talk about lifting. That sounds obvious, but it wasn’t always the case for me. I’m never going to reach perfection; someone else will always be stronger than me and life will always manage to get in the way of my training. But as long as I keep getting stronger, I’m doing something right. I don’t want my hobby to start to resemble a job too much so I try not to overthink things anymore.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I wish I had some words of wisdom to close this out with. But I’m still earning my stripes and don’t want to presume that what I learned about myself applies to others. Thanks for the invitation to indulge my ego. And I appreciate the advice you’ve all given me along the way.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_kmkwi,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/kmkwi/member_spotlight_chr0me/,

**Care to share some pics?**

http://tobeccaagain.imgur.com/member_spotlight_pics

Current pics as well as some from a year or two ago. Hard to take my own picture in arm balances, so I could only get into these quick ones with my timer.

**Stats?** 

Almost 27, 5’ 4”, 130 lb, about 20-22% body fat currently.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

Yoga! I instruct it 4 to 6 days/week and keep my own practice going as well. I do body weight workouts in HIIT format 3-4 times/week on the days my yoga is not intense. I also teach Boot Camp classes, but took a few months off and don’t start back up until September. I do a long hike at least every other week with my dog, and that’s my favorite activity. I jog minimalist occasionally, in no way am I an expert there though. I get addicted to lifting weights when it is convenient, but haven't since May this year when I stopped working at a gym :( When I do I stick to big lifts- squat, dl, bench, c&amp;j, ohp sometimes, and whatever else I randomly feel like concentrating on. 

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I’ve always been active. I was a dancer my whole life, then was on AD in the US Army for 4 years followed by some reserve instructor time. I came away from that with bad knees and not great ankles, and missed my dancing years, yoga and pilates classes I had done, and the look my body used to have. I got back into teaching dance and fitness, got certified in yoga, blah blah blah. Now teaching yoga classes is my main job. Yoga gave me back my flexibility, agility, and dealt with the knee/ankle issues.

**What are your current fitness-related goals?**

There are an endless number! I’m always focusing on getting better at advanced yoga postures. Long term I want to get back to hiking the Appalachian Trail. I would love to compete in a figure competition in 5ish years. Teaching is my first priority now so that will have to wait.

**Goal Body Weight**

It’s about how I feel/look. I am definitely a “pear” shape, so no matter what I weigh, I have an ass the size of Texas. Squats, yoga, and my HIIT stuff help to keep it more like a bubble and less like a secretary spread (I hate seeing that on anyone, ugh). I like to have definition in my abs, shoulders, and triceps as well. I fluctuate between 130 and 135, but I wouldn't mind 125ish ;)

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Vinyasa Yoga one hour or more 5 or 6 days/week, body weight HIIT stuff for 10 to 20 minutes 3 days/week, try to get in a longer hike once every other week.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Lots of veggies, complex carbs, lean meats, almonds, and dairy. I fucking love cheese and milk, it’s a problem. If I am feeling weak or training hard (boot camp classes), I take BCAAs before and after workouts. Also as needed, protein powder and – gag - psyllium husk. I splurge once a week on a meal out and a few pints of Guinness!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’?**

50 or more in GOOD form pushups in a row, and I get bored before I get tired with abdominal stuff. These are trademarks of a yogi that’s into Vinyasa/Ashtanga style yoga. I LOVE arm balances too.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Patience and practice make your body capable of limitless things. I don’t care what everyone else can do, I care what I can/want to do. I keep my eyes on my own mat (unless I’m teaching!). Above all, PROPER FORM in EVERY athletic discipline is key for strength gains and injury prevention. I want to be doing this when I’m 80, so I need to do it right. I try to meditate a few minutes or more every day on a different yama or niyama, but I'm only human and this doesn't always happen. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

To most of my friends, I am annoying because I am constantly talking about this stuff. As long as they stay my friend in real life, I could care less if they “defriend” me on fb to hear about it less. I miss a good deal of nights out drinking, parties, and the usual debauchery by choosing yoga workshops or hiking trips over them. It’s hard not to want to share the positive results I’ve had with loved ones… you guys get it. When something works and feels great, you just want to help your fam/friends to feel good too. Some jump on the band wagon, but most don’t.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Extremes in anything to me are not great. I do my own research. I only take advice from people that had to work to be able to do the things I want to do. If someone has natural ability, they are not going to be able to explain (as well) to me how I can get there. If someone used to suck at something and now they don’t, that’s advice I want to hear. No matter how great I am at something, there is always someone that did it first, does it better, or will perfect the art. I try to be a student whenever possible.

**What injuries have you dealt with?**

I have basically fixed my issues through yoga, but still “have” bad knees and ankles from my job in the Army. I also broke my foot dancing in high school.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Take the recovery time you are supposed to- don’t cut it short because it will bite you in the ass later.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

When I get bored with my own ideas, I go to Bodyrock.tv, yogajournal.com, and some blogs.

**Anything else you want to add?**

 - 192.5 kg / 424.2 lbs (three white lights)
 - 197.5 kg / 435.2 lbs (three white lights, +5.2 lb PR)


**BP:**

 - 110 kg / 242.5 lbs (three white lights)
 - 115 kg / 253.5 lbs (three red lights, couldn't lock it out)
 - Waived off my third attempt.

**DL:**

 - 227.5 kg / 501.5 lbs (three white lights)
 - 247.5 kg / 545.5 lbs (three white lights, +0.5 lb PR, +5.5 lb state fed record)
 - 257.5 kg / 567.5 lbs (three white lights, +22.5 lb PR, +27.5 lb state fed record)

My flight had 14 or 15 competitors from both the 220 and 242 weight classes.  It was also a mix of open, junior, and masters divisions and both raw and equipped.  So I have no clue if I set a new state federation raw DL record for my weight class.  I do know that I beat the previously held one.  But there were a lot of strong guys there, so I'd be surprised if I held onto it.  567.5 lbs seems pretty ""meh"" for a DL record anyhow.

**Lessons learned**

* *Get some good sleep!*  I went to bed at 9pm, but didn't fall asleep until 11:30p.  My two month-old daughter woke me up at 2:30a and then I had to wake up at 5am to hit the road.  This really screwed me up and is probably what caused me to miss my second BP attempt (my PR is higher).  I was napping between bench and deadlift.

* *Use more than one scale.*  I was concerned that I was going to cut it close to 220 lbs, but I weighed in at 210 lbs.  I apparently need a new bathroom scale.  Weigh-in was the morning of the meet and I had a very light dinner the night before and skipped breakfast.  Plus I was slightly dehydrated.  There was no need for this.

* *Don't underestimate the adrenaline factor.*  I was originally going to open with a 545 DL but changed it to 500 lbs after I learned that I couldn't attempt anything lighter even if I missed.  If I had stuck with a 545 opener, I likely would have attempted 585-ish.  I had done 545 three times before and should have trusted myself.

* *It's a lot of fun.*  I had heard that lifters genuinely cheer each other on, even if they're competing.  Before the meet, I had shrugged that off as magnanimous bullshit.  But it's the truth.  I honestly felt bad for guys who missed an attempt.  And the weights didn't really matter (until we got to the big boys attempting 700ish DLs.  Then people noticed the numbers).  Everyone was there just to see good lifts.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_lm3ti,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/lm3ti/meet_report_2011_michigan_usapl_state/,

&gt; uh, yea, ok...

&gt; [I used to be fat](http://img.thefraggle.com/before.jpg)

&gt; [Now I don't look bad](http://img.thefraggle.com/theeye.jpg)

**Age?Sex?**

&gt; 28/m

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

&gt; Competitive Weightlifting is my primary focus.
&gt;
&gt; I cycle and swim too, but recreationally, I've got a road cycling trip to Amsterdam, starting in  London, coming up during the August bank holiday.
&gt;
&gt; I also have a planned trip to Morzines to do some downhill mountainbiking, but I might need to cancel :(

**Do you compete at any level?**

&gt; Yea, though I didn't do very well in my first (and so far only) competition. I competed in the [London and Southeast Open](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rmli4/meet_report_2012_london_southeast_open_173kg_77kg/) in the 77kg weight category

**What's your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

&gt; December 2010 I was living in Frankfurt, and realised I was a fat slob at 110kg / 260lbs (I'm only 170cm / 5'7""). I decided to cut down, and got down to 74kg / 163lbs by the end of summer 2011. 
&gt;
&gt; In that time I started messing about trying to start the Starting Strength routine. Two or three months into that though, I got friendly with a competitive lifter who's girlfriend was a PT at my gym, and decided I liked the look of weightlifting.
&gt;
&gt; Since then I've been training pretty much only weightlifting, having had a couple of different coaches since starting. I joined Bethnal Green weightlifting club in January, and to be honest don't think I'll want to move again. The coach here is awesome and has helped me start to iron out my many weird technical weirdnesses and the other lifters at the wlc are pretty awesome too.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

&gt; This year's goal is to make at least a 205kg total in my current category. This will qualify me for next year's English senior championships. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

&gt; Mostly prescribed by my Coach. This week was:

&gt; Wednesday:
&gt;
&gt;    Hang Snatch, Snatch @ 75% x 2 x 4
&gt;    Snatch Pull @ 80% x 5 x 5
&gt;    Front Squat @ 80% x 3 x 6
&gt;    Military Press / Narrow Rows - 8 x 4
&gt;
&gt; Friday:
&gt;    
&gt;    Power Clean and Jerk @ 80% x 3 x 6
&gt;    Power Jerk 1RM
&gt;    Jerk off blocks/stands (must be higher than Power Jerk 1rm) x 1 x 6
&gt;    Back Squat @ 80% 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ... then die
&gt;
&gt; Saturday:
&gt; 
&gt;    Clean, Front Squat, Jerk @ 80% x 2 x 4
&gt;    Clean Pull @ 100% x 5, @ 105% x 4, @ 110% x 3
&gt;    ""Abs work"" - I did these things we call hitlers, that work your obliques. I hate abs work, so so much :(
&gt;
&gt;    I then proceeded to mess about and do some hang snatches just because.
&gt;
&gt; The rest of my week is usually made up of squats and technical work because I'm still working hard on trying to correct the little niggles I have, this week was pretty much:
&gt;
&gt; Monday:
&gt; 
&gt;    Back Squat to failure
&gt;    Snatch pulled about 90% x 5 x 5
&gt;    Hang Cleaned @ 80% of my clean max x 2 x 4
&gt;
&gt; Tuesday:
&gt;
&gt;    Power Jerk 1RM, because I was annoyed I only made 95kg on Friday. I got 100kg \o/
&gt;    Hang Snatch doubles @ various weights.
&gt;
&gt;I've started pressing and BTN pressing the bar as warmup/cooldown too, its started to make my shoulders feel a lot better, I might work on my press properly at some point soon, I want to see what coach says first if he thinks it's worth the energy being taken away from other stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I also want to get my squat up, so I'm going to chat with coach about maybe starting something on the side on days I'm not training my club schedule, if I can handle it / eat enough. Maybe smolov for front squats or something similar.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

&gt;I'm only just starting to eat a lot again, I eat pretty clean, lots of fresh chicken, ground beef, lots of vegetables such as broccoli, peas, carrots, that kind of thing. I LOVE sweet potato, but try not to go overboard, and have a little thing for peanut butter spread between two rice thins.
&gt;
&gt;As for supplements, I don't really use much...
&gt;
&gt;Fish oil - to aid my joints recovery, I'm getting old!
&gt;Choline - A recent addition, that really has seemed to help with my overall focus during the day, but more so during training.
&gt;Whey Isolate - I'm trying to put lean mass on
&gt;

**What have you achieved so far? What are your 'numbers' (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

&gt;I competed in a regional competition, but only made a 173kg total - 80kg snatch , 93kg Clean and Jerk - @ 77kg :( basically my openers. My best snatch in practice is 85kg and Clean and Jerk is 100kg. Best Back squat is 130kg, best Front Squat is 110kg, so far!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

&gt;Train hard, listen to coach, eat like a king.
&gt;
&gt;As I've only competed in this sport once, I've not yet formulated my perfect winning plan, basically, chill the hell out, and don't worry about how much time you have on the platform, I think are the key things to realise next time.

**What challenges do you face?**

&gt;Convincing myself that putting heavy weights above my head isn't dumb. It's getting easier, I'm more fearless now getting under the bar, which is pretty much a pre-requisite for weightlifting I guess.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

&gt;Seeing my progress over time, setting myself mini milestones. It's not really that hard, I usually enjoy going to the gym. The only rough patch I had was during December, I was without a coach for a bit and my lifts were staying the same. I was also feeling pretty tired and run down because I simply wasn't eating enough to train the 5 days a week I like to get in.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

&gt;I ignore them. The only people who naysay are those who have no idea what they're talking about. 

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

&gt;I take advice from experienced lifters and professionals. Advice from my coach, from the other lifters and people I know around here is pretty valuable.
&gt;
&gt;I ignore the advice which comes from people who know nothing about my sport or lifting heavy things in general. I've heard the whole ""oh but squatting is bad for your knees"" and other bullshit before, you know what, my knees feel **better** for squatting a lot.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

&gt;I don't really know any, I generally follow tried and trusted advice and methods ;)

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

&gt;Not really, my lifting style is pretty normal.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

&gt;Foam rolling, it's a great prehab tool. I started rolling a couple of months ago and it's definitely something which will stay in my routine. Massages as well are great, though I'm trying to find an inexpensive masseuse as they can get pricey doing them once a month or more.
&gt;
&gt;[Mobilitywod](http://www.mobilitywod.com/) routines have started to help a lot too, you should all check it out, if you haven't already.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavours?**

&gt; My shoulders keep getting strained; I just need to make them stronger!

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

&gt; Rest up and eat well, it's the only way to not muck yourself up, luckily so far I've had no real injuries other than minor strains. If you do get injured, seek medical help and take their advice. Most of them are helpful and will do what they can to aid you in a speedy recovery back to competition.

**What are your favourite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

&gt; Greg Everett's weightlifting book is great, it's on [amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Olympic-Weightlifting-Complete-Athletes-Coaches/dp/0980011116/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) and is pretty cheap considering the quality of its contents.
&gt;
&gt; He also writes articles for [website](http://www.catalystathletics.com/), the performance journal is worth the subscription too.
&gt;
&gt; I've started reading the [pendlay forums](http://www.pendlayforum.com) as well, there's some decent content there, as with r/Weightroom :)

**Anything else you want to add?**

&gt; For all the useless stuff that turns up in fittit, there's some good support and decent advice floating about, especially from the guys who frequent [/r/AF](/r/AdvancedFitness] and [/r/weightroom](/r/weightroom). If it wasn't for reddit I'd probably have never got into lifting via SS, and be stuck with fuckarounditis in the gym forever.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

I competed in Mixed Martial Arts from 2002-2009. I had 32 amateur fights(17-15) and 4 Professional fights(2-2). I had a few intermixed boxing and kickboxing fights mixed in for fun but I was primarily a grappler. Currently I'm just into weight lifting. I'd like to do some power lifting competitions next year.
****
**Do you compete at any level?** 

At one point I was a professional MMA fighter, nothing really now.
****
**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I had gotten my black belt in TaeKwonDo and did basic boxing in high school. My sophomore year of college I was talking about how well I would do in an ""ultimate fight""(note, I was completely bullshiting. TKD is a joke and I played the flute in band. I wasn't what you would call either an athlete or aggressive). One of my friends called me on my bullshit, he knew a small promotion in Memphis that would let me fight. He gave me their number in front of several of my friends. It was either call and get set up on a fight or look like a pussy douche in front of everyone. My ego won out and I called and there was an event coming up in 2 weeks. I showed up with all my friends in tow, made it through medical and got ready. They called my opponent out first then me. As I was getting in the ring I notice that my opponent is 3 inches taller, 30lbs heavier, covered in tattoos, and looked like he was well versed in punching people.(Ah, the days of early MMA) I, at the time, weighed in at 152lbs. I have never in my life had a more ""WHAT IN THE FUCK AM I DOING"" feeling than stepping into the ring looking at him. It went better than expected. I managed to weather an early ass kicking and cardio won me the fight. I was a decent runner at the time and managed to pull out a decision. It was ugly but it was a win. I was hooked and started to take fights left and right and slowly learning what the hell I was doing. So my record isn't the greatest because I was fighting every month and not really any training, I was just in the gym getting in shape. Eventually I got into a good gym, learned submission grappling, wrestling, and kick boxing and started to take it seriously. I helped start the Ole Miss Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA club at The University of Mississippi and its still going strong today and made some great friends. Eventually life got in the way(Air Force) but I hope to start training again around February.
****
**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

I was the Pyschout MMA Lightweight Professional Champion, I beat someone that was 15-0 to get it in a massive upset.

****
**What is your workout or training regimen?**

 SS for 6 months and now I'm on a split routine. Trying to put on size.

****
**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My wife is in charge of my diet. We eat healthy, I just try to eat a lot. Just protein, money is tight.

****
**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

At 6' tall and 180lbs my 1RM's are 305 Squat 365 Deadlift 215 Bench
****
**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

Sometimes it isn't about winning, sometimes its about not being afraid to bleed.
****
**How do you motivate yourself?**

My biggest fear is to be ordinary.
****
**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers**? 

I have the worlds most supportive wife. I'm lucky in that I have no one trying to pull me down, I only have encouragement.
****
**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I always seek the advice of someone that is more experienced. This is true for working out or at my job.
****
**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

If you are a competitive athlete, and you've never been pushed to tears, then you need to pick new training partners and coaches.
****
**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

 Broken hand, torn rotator cuff, dislocated elbow, nerve damage in my arm, broken nose, bruised trachea, multiple cracked bones in the top of my foot, multiple sprained ankles, several concussions.

****
**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks**?

Lots of ice, rest, and Vicodin.

****
**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I visit r/MMA fairly regularly but don't post often. Sherdog, MMA Weekly, and Bloody Elbow for news.

I've also been been honoured by being asked to Channel Crew for 3 Soloists in the next two years including redditor **bigattack**, hoping he'll the second reddit member of the *famous few*.. As a Soloist I appreciate the honour of this deeply &amp; seeing those people across is a priority.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Was easier 2011 than 2010 as I've had 3 years of pretty high level. But still 5 days pool, 1 day sea for now, more sea later in spring. Weekly average varies through year, 29k last week, increasing monthly.  1.15 millon metres in 2010.  
(1k swim ~ 4 k run ~ 20 k cycle).

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Just food. Rarely eat fast food &amp; or drink soft drinks. Drink alcohol lightly, not at all for 9 months Channel training or when racing open water. (But I also have a sweet tooth).  Porridge &amp; fruit smoothies with oats &amp; yoghurt before big swims. Milk. Berries are useful for endurance. Cals average maybe 2.5k per day, up to 8 to 10K per day while Channel training. Daily cold water swimming is incredibly demanding, the amount of food I ate was .. disconcerting.

Advice: Use coffee sparingly. It's great for endurance athletes if used for maximum effect. 

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, distances, etc)?**

English Channel Soloist 2010, #1134 in 135 years. Double English Channel team relay 2008 (national record). Lots of 4+ hrs cold open water swims.

I'm not racing you, I'm always racing myself. Open Water swimming is less about racing for me, it's more about adventure &amp; personal limits.

**What is your competition &amp;/or training philosophy?**

~ redacted by TGC ~
* Persevere &amp; your day will come.
* Some people want you to fail. (Tough one to accept)
* Bad days are more important than good days. When The Big Day comes &amp; it's not going well, it was on the bad days that you learned to endure. Good days are the tips of a sine wave. Most days you're either going up or coming down.
* Every Channel swimmer's motto: *Nothing Great Is Easy*.
* *Anyone can give up, it's easiest thing in world to do. To hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's strength.* - Diana Nyad.

**What challenges do you face?**

* Cold water. It's NOT a talent, it's a learned skill.
* For me, swimming is an extreme sport, no lanes, no lines, no mercy.
* People calling out the Coast Guard  helicopter (really).
* Lactate threshold. You should see what 14 hours swimming &amp; lactic buildup can do to a human.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Experience &amp; I desire greatly to be better than what I am, regardless of what others are. I am my own harshest critic. If it's not fun there's no point doing it. 

*A serious house on serious earth it is,*

*In whose blent air all our compulsions meet,*

*Are recognised, and robed as destinies.* 
- Philip Larkin.

**How do you deal with naysayers &amp; clashes between your lifestyle &amp; that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

The future Mrs Cthulhu is very supportive because she likes the parties. My local pool has been crap. Most of my best friends now are marathon OW swimmers.

**What advice do you take, &amp; what do you ignore?**

* I break Open Water Swimming Rule Number 1 (**Never Swim Alone**) almost every week. I advise strongly aginst doing this. The site now ranks amongst the world's most popular Open Water swimming sites.

* I listen very carefully when anyone comments on a stroke problem or something I could/should do better. I may disregard it based on science or experience but I have no ego when it comes to learning.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

There's too much obsession with supplements.

Extravagant ""psyching-up"" is useless and is only ego.

You can achieve almost anything with good food. Lamb's liver ftw.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training that you've never seen others do?** 

Being a Lone Swimmer, I occasionally offshore swim 10k unaccompanied. (This is likely to kill me). I train in rougher water, as I believe this is a deficiency with many OW swimmers.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Rotator Cuff &amp; impingement issues.  

Asthma. Hypothermia (most people *imagine* hypo). 

Adhesive Capulitis after the Channel, completely immobile left arm for 4 days, 7 weeks to complete recovery.(Normal recovery is ~ 9 months). 

For Channel swimming: it's dangerous, (though fatalities are only 6 in 1148). I now feel strongly that Soloists must acknowledge the danger &amp; deal with it. Know your environment &amp; minimize your risks. If you can't, forget marathon swimming.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries &amp; risks?**

* Sports massage. I didn't get my 1st until I started swimming. Spent months working on tissue scars from a lifetime throwing myself off stuff. It's the best ongoing thing an athlete can do for their body.

* *Magic Cups*. Freeze water in disposable *polystyrene* cups. Tear off about 2/3 cms &amp; apply directly for about 5 minutes. Keep moving the ice. Repeat as many times as desired. 

* Tennis ball &amp; tights. Simple &amp; effective for myofascial release.
 
**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

*Staying With It, On becoming An Athlete* by John Jerome, is a great book about the older athlete &amp; the process of becoming an athlete.

*The Sweet Spot in Time*, by Jerome, on the quest for perfection in sport. 

*Sports Stretches* by M.Alter is a fantastic &amp; simple compendium of stretches by individual sports. 

Maglischo;*Swimming Fastest*, has a few 100 pages on energy systems, training effects &amp; metabolism that are great for a non-biologist. 


Joe Simpson's *Touching The Void*.

Dr Tony Butt's *Surf Science* &amp; Bob Bond's *Sailing Handbook* have great bits on relevant oceanography. Many others in this area.

**Anything else you want to add?**

* Men are generally egotistical assholes. Guys who can barely float will say ""who the fuck do you think you are"". Women will listen and learn.

* Fat is not bad. It has purpose as insulation &amp; an energy store. Brown fat is metabolically *active*, more dense &amp; growth is stimulated by repeated cold exposure. 

* Log everything.

* Look at the after photo above again. The older man is Kevin Murphy, the greatest athlete I've ever met, his career is over 40 years long. He has accomplished more than all of us together ever will. What we look like means little.

To mark the occasion and welcome our new members, I thought a recap of the last few months was in order.  With a brief look to the future.  

[Seven months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/s0qif/a_new_spring_dawns/), the mods made the decision to open up AF to link posts in a first-stab effort to breathe new life into it.  I think it's safe to say that posts have certainly increased and over a wide array of topics.

We've recently seen a monthly thread start - [Monthly Musings](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/y5e4j/introducing_monthly_musings/) - where members can write down and discuss theories or ideas they been thinking on.  

Even more recently we've also reached out to several members of the fitness community to line up some AMAs.  We've already had two successful AMAs (and one I'd rather forget) with [Tony Gentilcore](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/13iei6/tony_gentilcores_ama_star_wars_nerds_and_people/) and [Dean Somerset](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/13vj84/ama_ask_me_anything/) who held his just today.  (And as an aside, there was also an [impromptu AMA from a sport psycologist](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f40lv/sport_psychology_iama/) held a year ago that I totally missed but is pretty cool. FYI)

With those AMAs came some collateral advertising of AF.  No doubt those actions and the higher quality traffic showing up on the front page led to us over topping 10,000.  

Given the above and knowing where the sub was at this time last year, allow me to say that the state of the A-Team is *strong*.  

If you're new to AdvancedFitness, welcome aboard.  I invite you read the [New Spring post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/s0qif/a_new_spring_dawns/) to get an idea of what r/AF is all about.  Remember, we are the signal that rises above the noise that is /r/fitness.  If we do not hold ourselves to a higher standard there is no reason to exist.  Please, *please* do not be afraid to ask questions if you don't get or don't fully understand something.  We're all here to learn and to share the knowledge we have.   

To the oldtimers, thank you for sticking with us.  We wouldn't be where we are now without you.  Thank you.  

Having re-read the New Spring post myself, I see the mods still have a lot of work to do and more plans to implement.  I'd love to see the Member Spotlight posts up and running again.  If you have someone in mind please nominate them through the link to your right.  User challenges I think would be fun and one of these days I'll get around to updating the sidebar.  We've got a few more AMAs in the works, feel free to name any people you'd like to see posts from, and we'll see if we can't get them here.  Maybe failon will get around to posting that soft tissue series. :P

If you have other ideas on what you'd like to see or where we should go, please share your ideas.  I'd like AF to be as interactive as possible.  

Wow.  Sorry for the wall of text.  Thanks for making AF what it is guys, and let's hope the future holds even more.  ",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_13wytb,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/13wytb/the_state_of_the_ateam/,moderator

Sometimes theories just don’t have enough evidence to be fully fleshed out, or they may be better informed by studies or experiences in other systems that you know nothing about. And sometimes you have some anecdotal evidence that you’ve researched but still can’t explain. The goal of this feature is to bring together /r/AF to discuss these issues that you have considered but don’t have or understand sufficient evidence to be confident about them.

This thread is not “please debunk this broscience.” There are already many resources available to address questions of broscience. The goal here is to discuss weakly supported and/or theoretical possibilities. As with most AF threads, if you have evidence to back up or debunk the topic being discussed, please include at least a link to the abstract.

This is also not to attack the relative merits and deficiencies of a single source. We aren’t a journal club. We’re going to be speculating here, so unless something is grievously flawed or directly countermanded by “stronger” studies, try not to nitpick the methods. Even Mendel’s research was flawed, so let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water.

If you’ve come up with some crackpot idea based on a single study you read or a personal experiment that you have some data for, throw it out here and we’ll talk about it. Currently, I don’t plan to have set monthly topics unless it’s desired or there’s something very relevant and pervasive making the rounds, but if it’s requested, I may try to come up with some.

After this first month, I'll try to post the thread at the first workday of the month. If you have any other recommendations or advice, I'd be more than happy to consider it.

Long live Member Spotlight.,42,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/loxhe/member_spotlight_is_dead_long_live_member/,"After the last Member Spotlight I took some time to reflect on its future. I had already taken a break because I was getting tired of  the organising, cancellations, deferrals, (and occasional abuse) and had just returned.

I realised one day (while swimming of course) that **I** couldn't anymore honestly ask people to be highlighted when they may be embarrassed. 

This is not an attack on anyone, I was just really disappointed at how things ended. I understood *why* people were asking the questions, but not *how*. Nor why they were unwilling to wait until the next MS. One MS *some* people considered sub-standard led to an instant negative reaction, not even a PM to me, the previous history of MS was instantly forgotten, the damage was done.

And as one of the oldest athletes here,and since most of you are younger than me, I was disappointed to see that many of you felt they couldn't learn anything from someone younger than you.

Member Spotlight was irretrievably damaged ... for me.

But it's your sandpit, not mine. I've asked a few people to step in and **bossesjoe** has very kindly agreed to take it over and that's AFTER I warned him about all the negatives. 

All data has been retained, I've given him access to the queue and PMs.  

Member Spotlight will live again under his stewardship. (If he ever needs a helping tentacle I've offered some of mine as backup).

Member Spotlight was meant to be originally about learning and celebration of achievement. I'd ask you all to remember that and support bossesjoe AND the future Member Spotlightees.

I read a study a while back that followed body builders and measured their testosterone levels when they were cutting down for a competition.

Current, and any ‘before’ photos?** [April 2011](http://imgur.com/a/eqvGy) [May 2012](http://imgur.com/a/Cve2Z#0)

**Age?** 24 **Sex?**  Female

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** None, unless you consider cheerleading a sport. I mean, I was pretty flexible and could jump very high.

**Do you compete at any level?** Negative,or shall I say not yet...

**What’s your story?** My story is that I got too comfortable with myself, let myself go, and realized I am in my twenties and at an age when I should be in peak shape but nowhere near it. I hit the gym to change my appearance and started reading a lot about lifting. Now I am hooked.

**When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** I got into my fitness plan starting April 17th, 2011. I know this specific date because it was the first time I took pictures of myself. My mother and father were both bodybuilders who competed in multiple competitions. My father last competed at the age of 50, and about a year ago did another ‘cut’ to have surgery. He still amazes me with how quickly and easily he can become shredded. My mother was also very built, with a beautiful figure. Their dedication to their sport, along with all the hard work I now know it takes, is incredible and a very strong motivator for me. I somehow always knew I would end up wanting to compete. The last competition my father did was really appealing to me. 

I was an idiot when I first went to the gym, being one of those ‘cardioqueens’. However, I was not seeing results that I wanted and started doing more and more research, finally giving resistance training a go. Then I began a modified SS + some hypertrophy. My body was changing, and I was starting to move SOME weight. It felt awesome.

The beginning of this year is when I decided to start competing in body building (figure or bikini). Since then, that is what I have been doing.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** My biggest accomplishment is how much I have changed my body in the past year. After all, that is what I set out to do. It is exciting to make strength gains and these gains definitely keep me motivated. Mostly, though, the body’s ability to change into something totally different through effort, patience, and time blows my mind. I have personally surprised myself in how strong I have become. Sure, to some other women who are lifting what I lift is nothing, but, to me, it is something I am proud of: the average woman doesn’t squat and/or deadlift, period, let alone with the weight I can do now.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** I jumped on the 5/3/1 train (who hasn’t?) Seriously, though, I am doing 5/3/1 with a BB hypertrophy routine tacked onto it along with a modified BBB. Why? Because I am nuts. I love to squat, and DL. If those two exercises were taken out of my routine, I would not enjoy lifting. 5/3/1 allows me to make gains over a shorter period of time, while still allowing me to do all my accessory BB work. My four day split looks like this: Squat day includes quads, glutes, calves OHP day- delts/tris/bis DL day- back, hammies Bench- I just added this on its own day. I hate benching so badly. I am working on my form. I plan on doing dips/ chins ups/ and cardio eventually when I start my cut. 

**What does your diet look like?** Eat all the things!!!! BULKING. This is what happened: I cut about 10lbs in the beginning of the year and I started to see definition. I was doing well with my diet and hitting my weight loss targets weekly. However, I went to the Arnold Classics this year and realized that if I want to compete, and really want a chance at doing well, that I needed more muscle because it was quite obvious I had none, especially in my shoulders, back, glutes, and calves. So bulking it is! I’m eating about 130-150g of protein a day and this is the only macro I keep track of at the moment. Other than that I am eating way more carbs than usual. I plan on doing a recomp soon, probably followed by a cut at the very end of the year when I am about 10 weeks out of my comp. I am hiring my coach in September so we will see what she recommends.

**Do you take any supplements?** Besides the standard whey, vitamin D, Fish oil, creatine, choline, and casein protein powder. I just cycled off of white flood..and restarted fasted training so I am now using BCAAs preworkout. 

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**  My last tested 1RM’s were in early February. I have made progress since. My last squat was 160X2, last DL was 175X9, last bench was 85X12,and my last OHP was 60X9. I dropped down to 128lbs from 135/136 at the beginning of the year and was probably around 18% BF. Since then I have been eating everything I am not up to about 141lbs with an obvious increase in muscle mass. 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** Be patient, work hard, be intelligent with what you are doing, and keep going. Listen to those who know their shit, brush off the people who hate on you. This stuff takes time. It is so easy to give up, which is why so many people are fat and weak. This has been my moto on life in general: if you want it badly enough, you will achieve it. End of story. People make so many excuses for everything. But if you are unhappy about something, change it.

**What challenges do you face?** I am my worse critic, and very hard on myself. I don’t like to half ass things. I am very passionate about life in general, and everything I do shows that passion. The other challenge would be time. It can be difficult for me to balance work, relaxation, my dog, a social life, gym, and eating properly. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** Realizing how far I have come is what motivates me the most. I did this in a year, imagine what I will do in an additional year if I keep the same pace. My parents motivate me, too. It helps to have a good group of people that are behind me wanting me to succeed as much as I do. Also keeping in mind the long term goal of actually competing. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** Naysayers: fuck them. They have no idea and, apparently, they lack the mental capacity to understand the difficulties, time requirements, and energy that strength training or BB competitions take. Clashes: you work around them most of the time. I actually changed my entire work schedule to be able to have more time to lift and focus on what I am doing. I went from three twelve hour days a week to four days a week of 8 hours in the evening, allowing more time in the AM for working out and making all my food. I have learned to take anything negative with a grain of salt. 

The people who are important to me will support me. Co workers have probably been the most difficult thing to tolerate though. Being an RN I hear the constant “you’ll kill your kidneys” “you’ll mess up your back” “bulky” blablabla. I used to try to educate these people, but now I don’t even waste my time. It is a common joke for people to say, “are you eating protein?” or “so what did you lift today”. I just laugh about it now.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** I take advice from people who obviously know what they are doing. I ignore the idiots. Any advice I am given I will research for myself and form my own opinion from it.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** Meh, I feel like anything I feel is true has been proven in a way. 

**Any innovations you don't mind sharing?** If you don’t have a proper reverse hyper machine you can easily make something similar with resistance bands and a bench and/or anything else elevated. People know this already. Drop sets work great for hypertrophy. 

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I haven’t had to deal with any major injuries besides minor aches and pains. Listen to your body, rest when needed. Foam rolling is heaven and hell combined.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** [Swolesister.com](http://swolesister.com) has been a very good motivator to me lately. Sorry boys, there are not many women who I can actually talk and discuss things with and who happen to have blogs. Superduper is one strong bitch, and her continuous gains have impressed me quite a bit. Other than that, watching Super_luminal and her progress has also been awesome and motivating. Smoftiebear has always been another lady who motivates me. She is hoping to compete and has kept me going. It is nice to share the annoyances and common issues and passion of competing in BB with those ladies.

**Anything else you want to add?** Thanks to all the intelligent fools who have helped me get where I am, and will help me to continue on my path. Also be on the lookout…for any updated pics/videos on how swole/tight/thick/solid I will be. Bahahahah =)

As I've come to expect from Kiefer, it's a well sourced and cited article.  This particular article, even though aimed at women, really struck a chord with me.  

Over the summer I really ramped up my running.  Nothing spectacular mind you, but a significant bump for me as I went from zero to ~12 miles a week at my peak (what a sad number).  Anyhow, I didn't change my diet at all during this time.  I stuck to my bulking diet v1.0 of 1000 calories over maintenance on lifting days (3-4 days a week) and 500 over on off days.  I was running 3-4 days a week as well.

While I certainly gained some fat following this routine while I was lifting and nothing else, I figured the added cardio would decrease this fat gain as I would be burning more calories.  Oddly, I started gaining fat at a much more quicker and much more noticeable rate.

My theory was that because I was doing more work that relied upon fat as the fuel source, my body adapted by storing more fat to fuel the future activities.  Kiefer implies this is not the case; rather my metabolism slowed and my hormone balance shifted.  

So the point of all this...  Does anyone know the specifics of this as it applies to men?  Is there any way around this effect if one truly enjoys running but doesn't want that added fat gain?  Is it simply a matter of 'don't over eat while doing any cardio'?  Any counter arguments to the points raised in the article?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_m42k4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/m42k4/cardio_and_fat_gain/,

Forthcoming in comments if my wife says yes. :)

**Stats**

 * Age: 28.9 
 * Sex: Male
 * Height: 5'10""
 * Weight: 170

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

In addition to recreational gymnastics, I practice martial arts - traditional (koryu) jujutsu ([kinda like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbbx0l8LtA)), to be precise. It's the historically accurate techniques that samurai used on the battle field. Yes, I know how to properly use a katana - and how to defend against one when empty handed. Come at me, bro.

In the future I plan to do some bouldering and parkour. The wife is interested in parkour, which is a plus

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I'm a desk jockey by day, and found myself getting all sorts of flubby a while ago. About 5 years ago, I started running (poorly) and doing yoga 3 times per week. I had a lot of fun, and got in good shape through yoga along with eating right. But I eventually switched jobs and didn't have access to that gym anymore. I got flubby again.

Then I met a girl, who is now my wife. Some switch flipped and I decided that I wanted to be as healthy as I could, so that I could enjoy my life with her and our future children. I started eating better, quit smoking, and started working out regularly.

My workouts have been very different, with one common thread - I prefer to workout at home. I've done workouts with dumbells, sandbags, sledge hammers, and many other things. The engineer in me loves the Ross Enamait style of making up shit at home to workout with. Eventually, I moved on to more gymnastic style training.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My goals are all over the board. The goals I'm actively shooting for right now are a 30s freestanding handstand, an elephant press (frog stand press to handstand), at least a 5s front lever and planche, a proper pistol, and a one-armed chin. The one-armed chin is amazingly close, and I can do a pistol with a heel elevation, but not barefoot...

Long term goals include things like a back handspring, iron cross, both front and side splits, and a hands-backward planche (which is significantly harder than a regular planche)

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I workout M/W/Sa, with Tu/Th being martial arts class. On Sunday nights, I perform a full-body isometric stretching session, focusing on my weaknesses - like hamstrings and wrists.

My workouts are a bit of a hybrid program. They generally look like this:

 * Warmup (Joint Mobility, Dynamic Stretching, etc)
 * Static Warmup (60s total of static positions, such as Front Lever and Planche)
 * Skill Work (I typically do 3x wall handstands here, or striking drills)
 * 1 Upper Body, 1 Lower Body Exercise
 * Stretching

It's a combination of Building the Gymnastic Body, Naked Warrior, and Convict Conditioning. The first 3 steps are largely based on the BtGB program, with the final work following progressions from both CC and BtGB, with the ""2 exercise, max"" concept and other specifics, such as full body tension, from NW.

I don't regularly do direct core work, but am debating adding it back in, as I believe it's my weakest link in the front lever/planche progress...

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I eat largely paleo, but do include dairy. I do, on occasion, allow for some potatoes or rice.

Supplements: I take a basic multi, 5000 IU Vitamin D, Vitamin K2, and Fish Oil. Every so often I include some calcium, as I have the bottle just sitting there. Additionally, I have recently added psyllium husk in pill form. I also drink approximately 3 scoops of ON Whey per day, in various disbursements.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Hmm, this is a hard one for me. I don't test maxes all that often, and don't really measure times for some things. For instance, when I do handstand work, I typically will set a timer for X minutes and just freestyle it until the timer goes off. I guess the most impressive things I have are:

 * 5s Half-lay Front Lever
 * ~10s Freestanding Handstand
 * 10-12 Standing Wheel Rollouts
 * 5m27s Plank (tested 3 months ago)

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

To me, it's all about health. And when it's all about health, being objectively strong isn't always the end goal. I put movement and mobility foremost.

Additionally, I am at odds with a lot of people here in that I don't follow the ""grit your teeth and push through"" mentality. I believe that if something feels too tough, or you don't feel like doing it, then don't - there will always be tomorrow. That doesn't mean I don't believe in pushing yourself. I just believe that you should listen to your body more than your motivation.

**What challenges do you face?**

Hanging gymnastic rings in a rented apartment is near impossible. Hanging them from a doorway pullup bar is a poor substitute.

I also have terrible wrist flexibility, which causes issues in floor-based gymnastic positions

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I just want to be a badass. Martial arts, back flips, you name it. This is motivating in and of itself. I think, deep down, part of me wants my future children to think their father is a badass, too.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really have this problem. I don't publicly talk about my lifestyle really, unless someone asks. And I tend not to surround myself with the caliber of people who would say ""you're doing it wrong, jackass!"". If I do run into people like this, I just smile and nod

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take a lot of advice related to visualization during certain movements. I always find them useful - ""pinch a coin"" or ""push the chest up"".

I tend to ignore a lot of hyper-specific supplement advice. You know the kind: ""Take 3.75g of Xotine Z-Plus 25 minutes before a workout, and then 1.5g mixed with goat butter exactly 75 minutes after"".

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Anything that is 0 calories and not water is bad for you - don't consume it. The spine is meant to bend, but not while loaded. 

Balance is a skill like any other, and can be trained as such. Most chronic physical annoyances (sinus pressure, acne, etc) are diet related

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I don't think anything I do is unique, just uncommon.

I love isometrics as a warmup - I find they actually improve my performance (assuming your don't go all out on the isometrics).

My secret weapon is dessicated liver tabs and green tea before a workout. It's likely just the B12 in there, but it makes me feel great.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Due to my ""listen to your body"" philosophy, I don't really injure myself. Yes, I end up banged up due to martial arts practice. I've broken my big toes at least 3 times due to shoddy break-falls when being thrown.

I have run into a mild case of the ""golfer's elbow"" tendinitis when I overdid it one day with inverted rows, but that's probably the worst of it.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Learn how to break-fall and protect your boney parts...

Also, take care of your joints - they deserve daily work.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Ross Enamait is my hero. He's a fighter, is ingenious with his contraptions, and is an amazingly intelligent guy. Other than that, I really respect Pavel Tsatsouline, Scott Sonnon, and Christoper Sommer.

**Anything else you want to add?**

As [edubation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/gtf82/member_spotlight_edubation/) said in his spotlight - I also have an inferiority complex. I feel like everyone and their mother in these parts are stronger than me. I'm completely ok with that, as I'm on a more long-term plan, but it's a little daunting sometimes.

**Got any new pics?**

   [This is basically my latest state](http://i.imgur.com/XbzdS.jpg?). Taken two weeks ago. Still 20%+ BF and ~230lbs. I'm using this as my 'before' for fatloss/weightloss, so I'm throwing it out there for all to see.

**Have you taken up any new activities since your last spotlight?**

   Not too much, but recently I have started doing more explosive type movements *(ex: Jumping onto 32"" box)*, trying to work my way back into sprints and recently I started lifting a 138lbs rock *(That I have in my back yard)* to shoulder height for 4 reps per set; two per shoulder. This is fun as shit.

**Have you competed since last time? How did that go?**

Yes! Twice. Here are the meet reports and vids:

It was such a great feeling to compete in something again. The worst feeling athletically in my life was the last time I walked off the field/court in H.S. and knew I would never play again in front of crowds in that way. This is such a great feeling to be able to get back out there and perform even if I'm not the best *(or tenth best)*

**What's been going on since your original spotlight?**

I quit my gym! I built out my weight training set in the basement over a 5 month period. I miss some of the equipment form the gym, but having my gym at home is absolutely the best and I would recommend anyone who is even thinking about it do it.

[I started with a Craigslist special for $100 that included bar, weights, mats and clips](http://i.imgur.com/dTApQ.jpg). I soon had a disappointment when I realized the bar was only 33lbs and my recent DL PR *(Thanksgiving Day)* was not a PR. I got over that and kept training. The total set was only 298lbs, so bought an extra set of plates about a month later as well as draping my two 20kg Kettlebells over the end for DLs as needed and I had 476lbs to train with even if wonky.

I basically did deadlifts, floor presses, Pendlay rows and kettlebell work for the next 5 months.

[In late January I got a squat rack finally](http://www.newyorkbarbells.com/pro93140.html) so I picked those up again. There is an intriguing situation going on with these *(see below)*

March saw a bench added and then at the begging of April I got my piece de resistance: A Texas Power Bar!

It is heaven and I immediately did a self meet to try it out. More on that in achievements section.

**What are your current goals?**

I'm really conflicted at the moment. Lifting heavy stuff is so addicting, but I am much too big for my liking. Thus I've decided on shorter term and longer term goals.  

Short Term (3-5 months): Lose weight even if it's at the cost of some strength. I want to be around 200lbs and ~13-15% BF. I wouldn't mind even going lower, but 200-205lbs is the goal. 205lb is the new weight class in IPF.

Long Term: Rely on muscle and CNS memory to get back any lost strength while maintaining weight. Eventual goals are 400lb Bench, 500lbs Squat, and 600lbs DL in competition. Set new goals after that.

**Has your training changed since last time? What is your current regimen?**

I'm still kind of dicking around since I was for so long with out the bench and rack. The last few weeks I've kind of settled on the following schedule:

* M: Bench/Rows or KBs
* T: Off due to life schedule
* W: Squats
* Th: Misc
* F: Bench/Rows or KBs
* Sat or Sun: Deadlifts or KBs
* Sun or Sat: Plyometrics/Rock/Sprints

Being a busy person, any day is subject to 'Off' and I don't let it bother me.

The one main thing I have changed technically is that I switched to low bar squats and I'm rocking the fuck out of them *(more intriguingness)*.

**How has your training philosophy, attitude and motivation changed over the last year?**

Mostly my philosophy has become: ""Lift every rep like you will in a meet"". It's simple but it helps me focus and I'm seeing progress.

That, and the afrementioned not getting too upset if I miss a day.

**What new tricks, innovations, and tweaks have you discovered?**

* Pausing! *(bench and squats)*

I had taken 6 months off bench press with maybe 5-6 total session of floor press. When I got my bench, I spent 3.5 weeks doing 5x3 pause benches starting at roughly 75% of all time max and doing that twice a week while increasing 5lbs every session. That worked so well, I'm going to continue something similar on a regular basis with some periodization. I pause every workset rep and deadstop all warmup reps.

Also, stop squatting for 5 months and your PR will shoot through the roof *(see below)*

**What is this intriguing situation with squats?**

[Here is the graph of my squats workouts](http://i.imgur.com/EWnfr.jpg) since I got my rack. My last squat before Jan 25th this year was Aug 23rd 2011 at Raw Nationals where I set a PR of 369lbs. As noted above, all my legs work was either deadlifts or high rep KB ballistics.

Got my rack and decided to see if I could still hit 300. \o/ So took a couple workouts to get my grove back and decided to try to PR and got it. I felt I had more. Another two workouts later try again for more. Got it. I knew I had 400 in me. The next week I did: 401lbs. Confidence is sky high. Decided to switch to lowbar and on my second workout with lowbar attempted and failed 403lbs, but it was *soooo* close and I was dead tired coming to the session after a workday. I knew LMAO4PLATE was mine.

I spent a couple sessions starting 5/3/1 and doing above bodyweight widowmakers for accessory while cracking down my lowbar form and that's when my TPB came. Self meet time: 405lbs!. I knew I had more in me.

This past Sunday was my Mom's and shortkid422's birthday so I thought it would be fun to hit 422 on 4/22. Got it. 

So after being off squats for 5 months completely, in only 3 months and 14 haphazard sessions, my squat 1RM has gone from 369lbs -&gt; 422lb...a 53lbs increase. 

I not taking creatine or whey, my sleep sucks and do does my diet. The only thing I can guess is [that I got this about the same time all this started](http://i.imgur.com/nj0A6.jpg). It must actually be magic. The funny thing is:

I know I have more in me....

**What have you achieved since the last spotlight? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Numbers from the previous spotlight:

* M, 5'11"", ~215-220lbs -&gt; **230lbs**!!!!!
* 90 lb DB Turkish Get-up -&gt; **110lb DB TGU**
* 275x3x5 squat but my only actual 1RM max after that was 285 -&gt; [**422lbs Squat**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1NdX99fh7k)
* 375lb Deadlift (no belt or chalk) -&gt; **435lbs Deadlift**
* 225x13 and a 1RM of 275lb bench -&gt; **300lbs Bench**
* 150lbx6 OHP -&gt; **[180lb OHP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWi39a9gRjE)**

New things

* Edubenchin challenge of 185lbs x 22 on bench.
* 100 snatches in 4:51 [with a 24kg/53lb kettlebell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2VTraiSK04)
* 207 snatches in 10:00 with a 20kg/44lb kettlebell
* Self meet: [405/295/435](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldayYlAYfJ0) in approx 1.5 hours where I set two PRs, missed tying bench PR by 5lbs and upped my total to 1135lbs
* Total now: 1153lbs

**Any new injuries or recovered from any?**

I may or may not have borked my left shoulder failing a 120lb TGU about a month ago but that remains to be certain. But the biggest thing I wanted to mention is that as of about 2 months after my last MemberSpotlight I am *no longer experiencing chronic back pain!*

I attribute this to deads and squats and taking about 6 months to get my back strong. Sure it still aches sometimes and gets fatigued a little too soon for my liking, but I'll take it if it means I'm not pounding 10-12 Aleve a day and laying on the floor with my feet up every night for 30 mins...

20 years old, male College Student Majoring in Political Science

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?**

I am a competitve powerlifter and judge in the USAPL (United States Powerlifting)

**Do you compete at any level?**

Yes at the State and National level, hopefully the world level soon.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I got into powerlifting shortly after I graduated high school (2009), I was unable to play college football because of expenses and a herniated lumbar disk I suffered when I was 14 due to poor lifting technique. I still had the competitive fire inside me, and had always followed the sport, never pursuing it because of football and the fact that my school did not have the sport available. 

I competed in my first meet November 2009 and posted a 340 lb Raw bench ( no supportive equipment) at 260-ish lbs. It has been non stop since. The reason I powerlift is because it is a childhood dream of mine, having the ability to live a dream is something a lot never get to do in their life. Every day I get to talk, think, compete, or practice this sport is a dream come true. 

To me powerlifting is more than a sport, it is a way to refine my character through rigorus practice and the highs and lows of the sport. It gives me structure and teaches me discipline while the chaos around me ensues. The amount of confidence it gives me is unfathomable. In this sport you can't have any self doubt, you have to have faith in your ability and bounce back when things do not go your way. Very few things in life can teach you this and develop a person like it can. It gives me reason of purpose and builds the man inside my soul, the being that lies inside all of us but remains dormant for most their entire lives. This sport teaches me how to unleash myself at will, and how to access energy and power at my command. It is a much a mental development as it is physical, I value both greatly and I learn something about myself almost every day. The lessons I learn translate into the real world better than anything I have ever been taught in school.

Commitment to excellence, and no fear in the face of adversity coupled along with goal setting and future planning, this sport has developed me into a better brother, student, friend, and son, but most of all a better human.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

A 600 lb bench press is my main focus right now, I will hit it at bench press nationals later this year in palm springs California, at least that is the plan. My current PR is 550lbs, training is going good and I am on the verge of 600.

I have a state record to my name, 512lb bench in the 18-19 yr old super heavyweight class.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I use something called the bell powercycle. It is the training program created by my world champion coach and has been very successful over many years for many different kinds of lifters.
For my bench press however I do utilize a new program came up with by myself and a training partner of mine, that has its roots in Boris Sheiko's plan, and the bell powercycle.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet now is rough, it being my first semester away from home. my schedule is much tighter and I work 30 miles from my apartment. I tend to eat whatever I want on training days, trying to load carbs early in the day and drinking lots of water. Ooff days I eat 10 oz of chicken breast with 2 cups of brown rice, an apple and a lot of nuts for lunch/dinner. and eat a huge deli sandwitch one whole grain bread. it is typically way over 35g of protein and i have no idea how many carbs.

I drink A LOT OF MILK, and a lot of diet green tea in the evening. supplements are expensive, I am living off free samples I have stockpiled! I use a multi vitamin and glucosamine/chondritin twice a day. My joints hurt because of my style of training at time, so keeping them healthy is important! What I do like to use when I can afford it is con-cret. best supplement I have ever used!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

I stand 6 foot 5 inches tall, and my weight fluctuates between 305 and 320 lbs. I have a 54"" chest, 19"" arms, 31"" legs and 62"" shoulders. My best total is 1470-ish, with a token squat and deadlift. ( I'm a bencher after all) however I have recently gotten into a squat suit and should squat close to 600 and put up a decent total!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

You compete like you train, so train hard. listen to your body, live to fight another day. when in doubt, pick up something heavy. Pay for it now, don't buy it later.

**What challenges do you face?**
Overcoming my injury. Most people with a herniated disk in their spine never do much of anything after it happens, I on the other hand have done more than ever with it. Training around this injury is difficult at times, especially when you have goals and a meet schedule to stick too.

**How do you motivate yourself?**
Music is one way I motivate myself, Lamb of God is my artist of choice and nothing gets my blood flowing like their music. Mostly I use positive self talk, in the gym and out of the gym, it motivates me to stick to my goals and to my morals and make the right choices.

The conversations I have with myself are really what get me going, I have honed my mind and soul over these years of training and they are at my will now, the feelings I get before I step on the platform or euphoric and give me energy like nothing I can explain. what motivates me more than all is my passion though, the burning desire I have deep down.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

Simple, I brush them off. But I am a lucky guy, everyone I know save for a select few is in support of what I do and is behind me 100%. I am one of the lucky lifters, especially not being the best one, I have a support system that a lot of top lifters do not have, and for that I am grateful.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I have had many conversations with some of the best lifters on earth. What I have learned is that not one single person has all the answers, do not take everything one individual says to heart, be objective and logical.

People never give me advice, I train at 'hardcore' gyms and everyone there is a competitor of some sort or just as serious about lifting as me. They respect the workout and do not interrupt my workouts to give advice like you see/hear about in commercial gyms. The few times I have been given tips, I just nod my head and smile :)

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

The body CAN absorb more than 20-30g of protein at a time.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

Not that I can think of off the top of my head... there are some extremes in powerlifting, but I cannot think of any I participate in.

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Board presses are key to a big bench press, as is a lot of upper back and lat work. People ask me what is most important, and this is it - your triceps and back. Your chest is important too, as are your shoulders. But whenever I work with a lifter, I add to their tricep and back load/intensity and they always perform better on the bench.

Also a set up and incorporating leg drive are vital to a big bench.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Aas stated before my lumbar spine injury which I still deal with today. There are plenty of injury risks including but not limited to: concussion, fainting, high blood pressure, broken bones, torn muscles/ligaments, cuts/bruises.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

TRAIN SMART. listen to your body and let it recover when it tells you it needs to. RICE- rest ice compress elevate.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

My favorite sports to watch are -football, olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, throwing.
To do are- golf, tennis, volleyball.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_qaauo,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/qaauo/member_spotlight_admiralvonbroheim/,
1322987853.0,35,self.AdvancedFitness,mzll1,"[Meet Report] 2011 IPL World Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada (crosspost from r/powerlifting)",39,4,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/mzll1/meet_report_2011_ipl_world_championships_in_las/,"This weekend my brother and I had the opportunity to compete in the 2011 IPL World Championships in Las Vegas. We started our preparation for this meet immediately after the USPA Rocky Mountain Regional in August.

My preparation for the meet involved acknowledging my inner HAES (moving from the 242 class to the 275's) and following Tim Henriques' deadlift program in the hopes of getting my 540 competition pull up to 600. I followed the program pretty much to the letter, except I didn't do the long eccentric on the deficit deadlifts. I also included an extra ME squat day each week where I'd work up to a 1-3rm, then do speed squats with chains for doubles or triples until I felt like stopping. Bench work was done mostly by feel so as to not aggravate my shoulder. I made an attempt at running Smolov Jr. at one point, abandoning it after a week and a half when my biceps tendons blew up. The volume greatly improved my form and confidence, though, so it wasn't a total bust. After that, I benched twice a week working up to a 3rm one day, 3x5 the other day, both followed by incline work varying the grip for chest or triceps depending on how I felt.

As Thanksgiving rolled around, I bloated up to 278 pounds and began my deload in earnest, feeling that I was in a good place to weigh in a couple hours before lifting (I couldn't weigh in the night before, as I had to work Thursday and couldn't make the drive fast enough to hit the evening weigh-ins). A couple hours out from Vegas, Steve Denison (meet director and federation chair) calls me and tells me to haul butt in there so he doesn't have to get up early to weigh me and inspect my gear. We check into the hotel around 10:30 and I head down to the ballroom to meet the scale. I came in at 266, demonstrating my utter ineptitude at bloating.

Anyway, I went up to my room, downed half a gallon of gatorade and like 30 grams of creatine (because I fear weakness more than diarrhea) before attempting to sleep. 2 reds on that attempt. Get up at 8, consume 4 grams of choline (because the diarrhea had yet to rear its watery head) and mix another 10 grams with my gatorade. Breakfast consisted of 8 or 9 star crunches, a 5 hour energy shot, and a bronkaid, leaving me plenty of time to get to the ballroom to warm up at 8:30. (Insert description of massive pre-squat dump.)


**Squat**

Warm up went as follows.

* Rumble roller, fire hydrants, hip flexor stretches, jumps

* Stare at all the monsters and wonder how badly I'm going to get crushed

* Stand awkwardly next to the ER Rack and wonder how to adjust the rack height

* Make friends with a kid from Hawaii who knows how to adjust the rack and start squatting

* 135x6ish, 225x4ish, 315x2?, 415x1 (I wasn't really counting)

My opening attempt on squats was 425. Easy weight, but I felt super jittery and almost lost my balance when locking it out. 2 whites, probably because one of my feet may have shifted slightly. Whatever.

Next was 474, matching my gym PR. When I did this weight in the gym a few weeks back, it was a grinder from hell. Today it felt easier than my first attempt and came up crazy fast. 3 whites.

Last squat was 500 for a big PR and 25 pounds more than I've ever attempted. It felt light and moved fast, but I must have gotten spooked and cut it high. Strange, because I don't typically get any rebound until I'm past parallel. Still trying to figure that one out. 2 reds and the first time I've missed a competition lift due to depth.

My brother was in the next flight and went 3 for 3, ending up with a 567 squat.

**Bench**

Bench warmups were next. I honestly don't remember what I did here aside from popping another bronkaid and washing it down with another 5 hour energy. Might have eaten a sandwich at some point. I do remember that my shoulder was feeling good, but that doesn't mean much when dealing with nerve damage and you can't feel pain until it gets really bad...

Bench opener was 257 for an easy 3 whites. Second attempt was 286 for a 45 pound meet PR. Smoked it and called for 308. Got the weight a couple inches off my chest after playing a couple rounds of Civ IV as I waited for the press command. Shoulder said nope! and shut down. No pain, but I couldn't flare my elbows and it felt like I was trying to press the bar through a brick wall. 3 reds and a long break before the deadlift.

My brother went 3 for 3 again in the next flight and broke a long-standing barrier with a 352 bench.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift warmups involved refreshing myself in a bath of liniment, downing another energy shot/bronkaid, and working up to 415 for a single. Possible sandwich.

Opening deadlift was 507. Dang thing flew up and about knocked me over. 2 whites because my right sock wasn't pulled up as high as my left.

Next pull was 573 for a 33 pound meet PR. Came up easier than the first, since I didn't have to fight to keep the weight down. With this weight I broke through to a 1300+ total and hit one of my major goals for the meet.

I called for 601 for my last lift of the meet and a huge PR. This attempt was the culmination of all my work since August and a weight I wanted to hit before the end of the year. It came up, feeling no heavier than the previous lift for 3 whites. It's entirely possible that I had more in me, but I'm happier with a successful 600 lbs pull than a failed 620 pull. This lift also bumped my total up to 1361 and classified me as a Class I powerlifter, so I'm quite pleased with it.

My brother finished the meet 9 for 9 and pulling 650 for a 1569 total in the 308's. We each ended up taking 3rd in our weight classes and we hope to return to the Rocky Mountain Regionals next year.

That kid from Hawaii took 2nd in my weight class with a stupidly high squat and bench. Shawn Bellon spanked us both, then impressed us with his iconic gentlemanly nature. I can honestly say that I've never competed with finer men.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this meet. I hit most of my goals and know that I'm capable of more. The judging was fair and consistent (except maybe for that sock thing) and the meet went smooth and fast. Props to Steve Denison for running a tight ship.

Other highlights:

* Hanging out between attempts, I found myself near Shawn. “Does standing next to you make me stronger?” I asked. “Yes, but only because I stand next to my wife.” Class.

* Sitting directly behind the right side judge when Chad Smith dropped his 837 pound squat attempt. Had a really good view of that mess. Not sure why there was only one scrawny spotter on each side, but thankfully no one was seriously hurt. Sucked to see him bomb out. I was really looking forward to seeing him total 2300 raw.

* No diarrhea.


TL;DR- Totaled 1361, didn't crap my pants.

**Age:** 24

**Sex:** M

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

My main activity is lifting for the sake of lifting. I have competed in two low-level strongman competitions, a few years back. I play intramural sports, mainly frisbee but also hockey, volleyball softball.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I am naturally a terrible athlete, always the last picked by the captain in gym class. In university I started to put on weight and realized I had to take control of my fitness. I started eating less and going to the gym, and lost weight. I was also lifting weights, to get stronger. I really, really enjoyed getting stronger so I kept it up, and started taking it more seriously. In 2007 I started squatting and deadlifting seriously and competed in my first strongman competition.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?
**
My recent success is that I lost a crapload of weight while staying almost as strong. At the end of last year I deadlifted 500 pounds and decided I was strong enough for the time being, and focused on losing weight mainly to look better. I went from the mid 210s to the mid 170s. As a bonus, I got much faster.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

My training basically involves doing full body workouts of whatever I feel like. I'll start with a full body movement like squats or deadlifts or cleans and work my way up to some sets of three, then two or one with heavier weight. I often work towards a heavy single on the first lift, even if it's not a maximum. Then I do another movement like bench or rows with more reps, and then finish up with some bodyweight exercises.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet basically involves eating meatstuffs and vegetables. I hardboil and peel 18 eggs at a time, and eat some for breakfast and some when I'm hungry. I eat fruit in between meals. My meals generally consist of some meat, an onion, some steamed vegetables (usually brocolli), flavour, and recently quinoa as filler. Occasionally I'll make a nutrient rich slop where I boil a cup of quinoa, a cup of beans, and a cup of lentils and store it in a big tupperwear and add it to my meals accordingly. It lasts about a week. In the past I've taken protein shakes but I'm not really a big supplement user. I prefer food.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**


My personal records are approximately 
* 505 deadlift 
* 409 squat 
* 300 bench 
* 230 push press 
* 242 clean. 

I say approximately because the bars at my current gym vary in weight.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

I don't have much of a philosophy beyond the stuff you'll read on any lifting forum. One thing I do is that I like to always set some sort of personal record when I train. Sometimes when I have a goal in mind and I fail, I pick another lift that I don't do that often and set a personal record in that. Once I failed a bench press PR so I went and front squatted 315 lb to come out of the gym accomplishing something.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I genuinely enjoy going to the gym and it's pretty much a habit for the past several years. I don't need to motivate myself further. When I'm going for a heavy lift I try to justify to myself why I should be able to do it (""I did three reps with ten less pounds, I can do one with this""), but that may or may not help.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really encounter naysayers. I work at/attend a university so the gym is always nearby.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Sadly, I ignore a lot of advice about thorough warming up and mobility training. Mobility's always something I've lacked and I've made a few half-hearted attempts to improve it, but I've been lazy.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I'll sleep on this one (about things I cannot prove).

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I don't follow a set program, which others may not think is a good idea but it keeps me consistently strong without boring me.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Fortunately I've never been hurt badly enough to see a doctor about it. I think a lot of elite strength athletes are predisposed to durability as well as strength. I've pulled some intercostal rib muscles. I've had some twinges in my back that go away after a while, and I have pain in my lower back if I press overhead too much while leaning back. I think this will be improved with better shoulder flexibility. The worst I've done is probably something akin to sciatica but never got diagnosed. All of these were light enough that I just had to avoid going heavy for a while.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

My advice to avoid this is to not do explicitly stupid things, to follow the ""if it hurts, don't do it"" rule, and respect the weights instead of treating them like toys.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I learned most of my iron knowledge on the Sherdog Strength and Power forum (now Strength and Conditioning). That was a great forum which I sadly don't post much in these days. An organization that spun off from it, Saint Wilhelm's Non-Denominational Church of Strength and Power, is also worth checking out (it's not religious). The concept is you buy the shirt, then post a video of yourself doing something awesome in the shirt. There was a guy who was battling Crohn's disease who posted a video of him overhead squatting his own weight, and another guy who was some sort of Viking badass hammering a hot iron spike until it folded over in only like eleven hammers.

*****

**The Program:**

I followed it to a tee. No upper body pressing for three weeks other than the benching. I even managed to hit a squat PR at the start of week two (320x1). 

I found it to be pretty easy on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Saturday triples would be a little more challenging but okay. Rest times were relatively short (2-3 minutes max) throughout the program. Added 10lbs the second week and 5lbs for the third week. Had a lot of time to work on form (tucking in elbows, light touch on the chest, tightening the back). 

I did heavy upper-body pulling on Wednesdays and Fridays (weighted pull-ups, Kroc rows, curls). 

*****

**The Diet:**

3,200-3,500 calories on off days, 4,000-4,500 calories on workout days. Fat around 100 grams, protein 230-260 grams, carbohydrates filling the rest of the calories. I was also fasting for 16 hours every day (Leangains bulking). 

**Weight:**

*Before:* 196lbs (89kg) 
*After:* 200lbs (91kg)

*****

**Results:**

*Bench previous:* 210x1

*Bench now:* 230x1 (possibly 235 if I wasn't testing PRs for every 5lbs - it felt light but my stabilizers were a bit exhausted)

That's a 10% gain for somebody with an incredibly stubborn chest.   

*****

**Recommended:**

Yes.

**Edit:**

To prevent shoulder pain, I also did Cuban Presses before every bench workout and overloaded on fish oil (3g EPA+DHA a day). Worked great. ",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_ioriv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ioriv/smolov_jr_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/,

[Let's] get right to it. I'm actually in the midst of getting all cut up for the beach, so part of me wishes I could put off the big reveal until next month when I plan to be another 5-6 pounds leaner and maybe a little tan, but [...] I just took some pictures last week. [...]I don't have a lot of old pictures where you can see just how skinny I was, probably because it was embarrassing. [But here's one from 2006](http://edge.imgur.com/f4TdU.jpg) when I was in college. I started lifting in the summer of 2008. I'm about 6' tall, and bodyweight was probably around 145-150 [then]. Fast forward 2.5 years of training, and here are some pictures from the [end of December, 2010](http://edge.imgur.com/n7Rbs.jpg). Bodyweight was 200 here. Then in 2011 I started training/eating a little more like a bodybuilder. [Here](http://edge.imgur.com/FhE5a.jpg) are some [recent pictures](http://edge.imgur.com/MaHDS.jpg) at a bodyweight of 181.

**Age &amp; Sex?**
26, yes please

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete?**

I'm pretty much just a recreational lifter. Awhile back I signed up for a strongman competition at the community center where I used to train, but they canceled the competition because I was the only one who signed up. So I do consider myself the Katz JCC's strongest man. I've given thought to competing in powerlifting and I'm sure I will at some point, but it's not on my agenda at the present moment.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I was always skinny growing up. I played soccer from childhood until high school, at which point I started focusing on more “indoor” pursuits like theater, music, and computers. I remember trying to pick up lifting a couple of times in high school, but having no clue what I was doing – I'd spend a couple of weeks messing around aimlessly with machines and isolation stuff, then quit when I saw that I wasn't getting anywhere. The idea of doing a squat or deadlift never crossed my mind. I thought I was just a skinny dude and there was no changing that. I was always a smart, nerdy kid, and I tended to think of myself as an artist and an intellectual whose physical presence was merely incidental. I had the idea that some people were naturally athletic and others weren't, and the concept of becoming strong or improving myself physically didn't really register with me. Then at age 23 I found myself out of college, single, and totally inactive. I was reading on the internet and something clicked in my head and I realized that if other people could make themselves big and strong I could do it too. I decided it was time to start doing something with my body. I read all about strength training on the stronglifts site and it sounded like a good project, so I jumped in and haven't stopped yet.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Right now I'm focused on getting lean while maintaining as much muscle/strength as possible. I spent 2.5 years getting strong and gaining weight and reached most of my former long-term goals, so I decided my new goal is to look like a Classical sculpture.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Right now I'm training using the “powerbuilding” ideas I've gotten from John Sheaffer of [strengthvillain](http://www.strengthvillain.com). Since I've been losing weight my absolute strength has taken a hit pretty much across the board, so I've introduced a lot of variation to keep things interesting and eke out some progress where I can. I squat and DL once a week, rotating different variants and rep schemes. For my upper body stuff I do an A/B rotation, where A and B each have 3 different pressing variants and pulling variants. I've been doing rest-pause sets for all of my pressing work, where I do a set to failure, wait for about 45 seconds, pick it up and go to failure again, and then repeat that one more time.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I start and end every day with a protein shake. In the morning it's skim milk, natural peanut butter, some fruit, protein, and oats if it's a training day. Before bed it's just protein in water. In between I eat a lot of eggs, rice, fish, chicken, and vegetables. I eat steak and ground beef occasionally but less now that I'm leaning out. After workouts I have a shake with 3 parts waxy maize to 1 part protein. I take creatine daily, fish oil, and a multivitamin. I recently started taking Jack3d pre-workout.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your *numbers*?**

My highest absolute numbers were hit at a bodyweight of around 196.  

* squatted 395x5 
* DLed 485x5. 

My best singles were 

 * 405 squat 
 * 525 DL 
 * 200 press
 * 250 bench 

A few days ago when I got down to 180 bodyweight I tested myself &amp; hit an easy 385 squat and 180 press.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

It's a struggle sometimes. It was definitely easier when I was first starting out and the gains were steady. Now I have to fight a lot harder for them. I was also single then, and I remember motivating myself with the idea that if I could get bigger and stronger more women would want me. I think it worked, and I've been with an awesome lady for a couple of years now. I still want to look good, and I look better than ever, but in a way motivation was a little more straightforward back then. But I'm pretty good at setting a goal and pursuing it until I get there. The internet is good for motivation, too – I can always read or watch videos or look at pictures of someone better than me. And I take pictures and look in the mirror and get motivated to improve. It's a fine line to walk though, because it's easy to get overly self-critical and feel like you're never good enough.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I've been pretty fortunate to not have dealt with too much of this. I taught my girlfriend to lift after we'd been dating for a little while, and she's been training with me consistently ever since. She's not quite as dedicated as I am, but she squats, presses, and pulls the same as I do. When I was gaining weight my family would tell me that I was fat, which was annoying, but I knew exactly what I was doing to reach my goals, so it didn't bother me. None of my friends really understand or relate at all to what I do, which is kind of a shame because I wish I had more people to talk to about it, but there's always the internet.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I'm always working on honing my bullshit detector, which is important, because there's a ton of bullshit out there when it comes to training and nutrition. It's tough to distill my approach to it into a pithy phrase. I pay attention to things that seem logical and things that have been demonstrated to be effective. But consistency is important to me; I try to set goals and stay on track until I reach them, so I'm not the type to always be trying out every new tidbit that I heard. I've got my whole life to train, and while I've played around with a few different approaches at this point, I'm in no big hurry to try out every idea that's out there.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I believe that most people's quality of life would be improved by getting stronger, and that a lack of strength is responsible for a lot of everyday physical complaints.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I'd say I've most of what I do is pretty tried and true. But one thing I'm pretty good at is getting amped up before a big lift. I read some research once about how when people are made to move their face muscles like they are smiling, they report feeling happier – their emotional state seemed to follow from their facial expression. So before I lift, I try to make myself put on an expression like I'm angry, or like I'm going to get into a fight. I grimace, flare my nostrils, clench my fists, and take deep breaths. I tend to find that my body will respond with a fight-or-flight type response, and any fear I have of a PR set will often be subsumed by that reaction.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've been lucky or smart enough to not have dealt with any significant injuries yet. But I've dealt with a couple bouts of some type of chronic inflammation that were difficult. Back when I first started training I used to get pain on the outside of my hip when I squatted. Some days I could train through it, other days it hurt to walk. I had a similar thing pop up a couple of times in my triceps. It would present as a dull pain deep in the back of my shoulder that sometimes stretched down to my elbow. That was tough because it affected pretty much every lift I did. Sometimes it would flare up at night and keep me awake.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I think it's best to train through it whenever you can. I kept training through all of the above and they all just went away eventually. I rolled the painful spots with a tennis ball, took NSAIDs when it was really bad, and adjusted my training when it was necessary.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Folks who have seen a lot of my comments probably know that I'm a big fan of Rippetoe. I especially appreciate his precise mechanical analyses of the lifts and explanations of the anatomy involved, and the logic and clarity of his general approach to training. I'm also fortunate to know John Sheaffer of strengthvillain.com. He's a really knowledgeable, friendly, and generous guy, and he's helped me broaden my horizons a lot.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I recently built myself a Prowler sled for my lacrosse team conditioning. It was a pain in the ass because I couldn't find any design for what I wanted, so I'm hoping to help anyone else going through the same thing.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/E77Xh.jpg) is the completed sled. [This](http://i.imgur.com/qosdt.jpg) is a teammate pushing it, and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrdDZUkh6U&amp;feature=player_embedded) is a teammate pulling the sled.

Giving instructions is going to be somewhat difficult as I was unable to take pictures of the sled while I was building it. I can, however, provide a list of the parts and pictures of the completed sled and answer any questions. I did it entirely improv'd, so that'll be more information than I had going in to it. The sled is 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and weighs about 60 pounds empty. The handles are 18 inches tall. Here's the list--

9' 4x4, treated

8' 2x4

2x3 board, reasonably thick

12 square drive multipurpose screws, 1 and 5/8"" length

12 4"" lag screws

1 big ass eye bolt

2 threaded pipes (18"" tall, 1"" diameter)

2 threaded pipe bases to match pipe size

8 1.75"" screws for the pipe bases.

Thick carabiner

Harness (sold separately, bought [this one from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/World-Sport-Harness-Tubular-Handle/dp/B002QNQJ5O/ref=pd_2) and it works fine. 

[Sled without pipes attached](http://i.imgur.com/OHg3j.jpg)

[Threaded pipe base close-up](http://i.imgur.com/xO0DS.jpg)

[Sled front and eye bolt](http://i.imgur.com/tgKhU.jpg)

[Completed, pipes attached](http://i.imgur.com/qNuPM.jpg)

You'll notice a shitload of dry Gorilla Glue on the front of the sled. I originally had larger non-threaded pipes and thought I could ream out the 4x4 and sink them in to the runners and then bolt that through, but the threaded pipe was the better way. You can remove the pipes for easier storage this way and no quality is sacrificed.

Make sure you cut your runners evenly and always double check to make sure the back of the sled is the back and the front is the front. The eye bolt side is the front and the runners are cut up on that side. It makes a difference. 

Drill the 2x4 ""rims"" onto the 2x3 base before you attach the base to the 4x4 runners. Use the wood screws and drill from the bottom of the 2x3 base into the 2x4 rims. (shitty wording, I know). Use the lag screws to attach the base to the runners and pre-drill your holes.

I'll answer questions to help clarify. I am clearly not an architect, artist, or design student, but I'll do my best to alleviate confusion.

What, and reveal my identity to the world?

**Age?** 24 **Sex?** Male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Climbing, mostly bouldering. I competed a while, but only regionally. Now I'm on the other side, routesetting.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

Before climbing I was sedentary for about six years. A friend took me to the climbing gym and it caught me pretty hard. Everything changed overnight. Climbing became the reason to watch my diet, sleep better and manage my time well. Before, I was the skinniest fat kid you ever saw. I gained 30 pounds of muscle that first year, it was a crazy transformation.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?**

I'm very focused on climbing new problems (first ascents) at my limit. Lots of guesswork, planning, ambition, long drives, self-doubt, giving up, driving home, driving back next weekend, last-second-fading-sun glory. Every plateau is a bit bigger. I did recently finish off one big project, but I still have a dozen going.

I couldn't do 1-5-8s on the rungs in February and now I can. So now I'm working on 1-5-9. I recently became able to one arm deadhang the smallest edge on my fingerboard for a few seconds.

I'd like to be able to do OAPs on rings - right now I can just barely do them. On a perfect jug ledge. At the very beginning of a session. After a rest day. Heh.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

During climbing season, all over the place. The joy of climbing outside far surpasses any training regimen for me, so my best laid training plans can be torn asunder by a streak of cool, dry weather. I climb or train at least five days a week. As far as specific training, I do one or two periodized training sets during winter. 

Summer is more random:

* Wednesday 7/6: light routesetting day, two 45' routes on vert; weights - one arm rows, flyovers, pullovers, and shoulder stability stuff. I have lots of compression projects right now. 

* Thursday 7/7: Core work in the AM, then ~3 hours of gym routes with my SO in the evening. 

* Friday 7/8: My bouldering circuit at the local crag (about 30 problems V5-8), short ring workout at home, 1 hour of easy cardio for recovery. 

* Saturday 7/9: Campus in the AM (4x 1-3-5-7-9-88-77-66-55-44-33-22-11, 4x 33-55-77-99, 4x 1-5-8, cool down by campusing easy problems), rest for the day. 

* Sunday 7/10: Climbing outside with some friends. 9 pitches between 10c and 12c. More or less another rest day. 

* Monday 7/11: ~4 hours of gym bouldering, ending with what we like to call the Punisher - ""50 of any problem over V5 in one hour"" circuit, then a hard ring workout. 

* Tuesday 7/12: Rest - bike ride and yoga

Pretty disorganized, and doesn't include riding my bike to work and back, the constant usage of doorway hangboards at both my house and SO's, and about 1 hour a day of ""cleanup"" work - myofascial release, various physical therapy for injury recovery, stretching, contrast therapy for fingers, etc.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I eat lots of meat, tons of veggies before a session, fruit all day during climbing. I don't eat much refined stuff and try to avoid alcohol on training days, but I also eat whatever my body craves. So there are days where I drink a mocha and eat a muffin for breakfast, and I'm cool with that. I think supplements are completely bogus or at the very least unnecessary for climbing. It's a movement sport - more technical than physical. Recovery meals or protein shakes make a huge difference in my recovery turnaround for max performance though. The best plan is the one you'll follow, so why bother forcing yourself to eat ""zone"" or some such garbage? Just eat a diet that sustains your performance, that you are cool with eating for the rest of your life, and doesn't completely ostracize you from every social gathering.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

I hate grades and spray, but let's just say I climb at a ""pro amateur"" level - good enough to get sponsored if I wanted to, but you won't see me on a magazine cover.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?**

Climbing is movement, so I just try to practice as much as possible. I try to do 30 hours of training per week, with about 10 of that hard training, and the rest movement practice, the more the better.
I don't have near as much power as most of the people who climb my grade, so I really have to focus on doing things right. I can't just grunt my way through things - I have to understand what I'm doing. Training really hard for strength is kind of a weakness of mine that I'm trying to work on.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Bouldering is meditation, exercise, a day outdoors, a social life, a puzzle and an adventure all in one. A better question would be ""how do you motivate yourself to make time for anything else?""
I struggle with hard gym sessions sometimes, especially power endurance when I'm on like problem 5 of a 20 problem circuit and I just want to lay down and die. For some reason, that Bruce Lee quote always works for me. ""If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.""

And if you've ever climbed any of the hard problems Gill put up in the 70s wearing high-top boots and socks, with no crash pad, you know just how far us ""modern"" climbers have to go...

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

My SO climbs, so she gets it. But yeah, when everyone else is heading to the lake for the weekend or relaxing drinking a beer, I'm driving 7 hours to try a project and sleeping in my car. It's not for everyone.
Like any other athlete, when I train for 5 hours and my friends ask me if I want to go to the bar I have to pass. It sucks, but when I finally send my hard projects, I get to unwind a little.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take everything with a grain of salt. A lot of climbers at my level are just unbelievably strong and will often say things like ""you aren't trying hard enough,"" which can get annoying. But I do need to hear it sometimes. Mostly I just keep my ears and mind open. The ""weakest"" climbers are sometimes the best, because they get the movement. If you ever meet a female climber over 40 who climbs hard, you can etch everything she says in stone.

I ignore the commercialized fitness machine - GNC, ""health"" magazines that are more unhealthy than the most decadent cake, blog spam, anything with the words ""get ripped"" in it. It's all advertising. Strength is function. There are millions of people with 8 pack abs, but there is no vitamin, chemical or pill that will make them climb v12. That takes drive, focus and a metric shitload of work.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Diet is placebo. If you eat something you think is working, it works. I manage my diet, but I've watched a guy eat a party size bag of kettle chips and redpoint a 5.14b.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

It's not different, but write down EVERYTHING. Even better - film yourself climbing and review it later. I have lots of video of myself trying my current project. Most of it is pathetic, but I've gleaned a bit from watching myself struggle.

I micromanage my shoes and skin. A lot.

Less is more when you start. Hold back a bit and you'll progress faster.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Strained pulleys in every finger. Flexor tendon sprain. I tore my ulnar collateral ligament and broke my thumb in two places sticking a dyno in a competition. Stress fractured my toes from repeated falls in tight shoes. I'm lucky compared to my peers.

My current project has a juggy ""keyhole"" two finger pocket where you can lock your thumb and two fingers in. You're wide open on a bad sloper with your other hand and you release tension violently to catch another pocket. The keyhole is on the lip of this roof so you can barely reach it from the ground. If your feet come off and your fingers don't come out of that pocket it's terrifying, every time I try the move I think ""this is it, I'm going to tear my fingers off and end my career."" Then you hit the pad and you're still fully extended, fingers are locked in the jug pocket, and you exhale and go ""holy shit,"" take them out, and make sure everything is intact and take a breath and do it again. But it's exhilarating too, if that loop wasn't there the problem might not even be possible.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

The most important part of improving at sport is not getting hurt. So get good spotters and get good at it yourself. Respect your gear, your friends and ultimately your fleshy meatbag mortality.

Big believer in recovery training for climbing - easy laps where you're just barely working. Flushes the muscles and keeps your joints, tendons, etc healthy. I also cross train a lot - tons of yoga, biking, swimming, running.. anything that uses different muscle groups.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Performance Rock Climbing is the bible. Rock Warrior's Way is also good. I love Dave MacLeod's training blog/book, Will Gadd's blog, tons of other climber blogs. I like most climbing movies, they're great for rest days or getting psyched. Between the Trees and Better than Chocolate are probably my favorites.

I don't have any “before” pics, but I wish I did, because I graduated high school at 120lbs at 5'10”.

I also don't have any good physique pictures because I don't own a camera, but I'm about 185lbs at under 10% bf, I can see my abs clearly defined even in bad lighting. [Photos](http://imgur.com/a/Z4Dbp) of me lifting heavy shit to make up for it. 

**Age?** 

23 

**Sex?** 

Male. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

In addition to maintaining “outstanding” fitness scores in Navy PFAs, I am a competitive lightweight strongman. I compete in the 200lb class and the 231lb class weighing between 180 and 190. I've been as heavy as 210, but I lost some speed and conditioning to get there. I'm not great, but I'm pretty damn good. I don't enjoy an easy win, so I compete either in a heavier weight class or at better shows to keep me motivated. 

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

I wrestled in high school as a way to manage my ADD, and at the section championships, I won in the semi-finals, but none of my family realized I had won, because I had been physically mauled by a much stronger opponent. I realized that I had been relying entirely on my conditioning and technique, and that I was losing to guys that didn't deserve to beat me because I was weak. I started lifting, and when I was a college freshman, I met Jared, a lifelong friend and lifting partner. I was pressured into my first competition just 11 months after starting lifting, and I've been hooked since. 

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

Hmmm. Right now, I'm just trying to build my base back up to where it was, while gaining some mass back. I went from running a 14 minute 1.5 mile to close to 10, I'm proud of that because I hate running. I'd like to pull 500 again by August, we'll see what happens. Squatting 500 by September isn't out of the question. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Right now it's Chad Smith's Juggernaut training with sprints and PT worked in Photosregularly. I do the “speed and power” option because it suits my competition strengths. I also firmly believe that increasing work capacity and power expression is the fastest way to develop the ability to get stronger. Notice I didn't say “to get stronger” but rather to develop the ability, see it as a ceiling sort of. 

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Intermittent Fasting. Typically fasted morning cardio 3x a week (PT, running, ultimate frisbee), so just some BCAAs and caffeine for breakfast. I eat big after workouts, and not so big other than that. Nothing secret, just veggies, meat, and lots of milk.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?** 

 - Push Press: 250x11 in competition 

 - Circus DB Press: 180lbs, my bodyweight, with either hand. 

 - Deadlift: 505x4, recently 385 for 20. Straps and suit on the 505, no suit for the 385. 

 - Squat: 440 in a belt. Just did 265 for 20 no belt, that was painful. 

 - Atlas Stone: 330lb stone to 48” box 

Nothing else to note. I'm not that strong, like I said, I do well in contests because I'm faster and better conditioned.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

Westside. I got to train at Westside Barbell a couple years ago and it changed the way I look at strength. Speed work is incredibly important, along with increasing work capacity. There are so many ways to do this, and I love that Westside makes it easy to incorporate them. I've been forced away from this training method for a few different reasons, but I'll start training this way again before I start competing again. 

**What challenges do you face?** Fuck this question. I'm not about to talk about what's standing in my way. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

This one is complicated. Mostly, I'm afraid of not getting better.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

I don't. My friends think it's awesome. I get jokes and too many requests to help people move, but all the people in my life are supportive now. That means that either they came around when they realized it mattered to me, or they weren't the kind of people I wanted in my life.

No, this doesn't mean I think lifting is more important than friends and family. It means that anyone that isn't going to be supportive in anything I do, doesn't belong in my life. This just happens to include training. I tend to live by the saying, “You are the average of your 5 closest friends”. I first heard this from Charles Poliquin, and I think about this all the time. Surround yourself with people that will lift you up, not bring you down. 

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take advice from people that have been there. There are so many weak people out there trying to write articles about how to get stronger. I've beaten many of these so called “strength athletes” being a mediocre athlete at best. How can they get me stronger when they can't do it themselves? A while back, there was an article about including strongman training by a “competitive strongman”, and it was a terrible article. I looked the guy up, he took second in a NOVICE competition with 3 people in his weight class. He would have gotten destroyed at a real meet, but he was writing about strongman like he knew the sport. But this guy is free to write articles on the internet, and people think that makes him qualified.

This is just one example. Another guy I've competed against wrote an article “how to bench 405lbs” or something like that. He's never benched 405, so how the fuck does he know what it's like? This guy came to train with our crew once and no one wanted to be around him, and he couldn't figure out why. Meanwhile he's milking teenagers on some bodybuilding website writing articles like he's someone.
I've been incredibly fortunate in where I've been. I've trained at westside, I spent 6 months of my life training alongside multiple national record holder Nick Brugal, I've trained with strongman world champion Derek Poundstone, and had waffles with Louie Simmons. These guys know more than you could ever learn from an article. Nick taught me more on one session than I ever learned from thousands of articles or 2 years of education in biomechanics. These are the kind of people I take advice from. I'll listen to ANYONE, but I'm real careful of what I'll apply. 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Pain tolerance is more important to success in my sport than natural ability.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

Haha there's a lot I do differently, a lot I've stolen from others, but it's still not a question worth answering. 99% of people need to stick to the basics.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Too many to write.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

I warm up, I stay balanced, I don't do anything stupid outside of competition. This is a really general question since there are so many different risks and each should be approached differently.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

See below. I don't have any before and after pics though.

**Age, Height, Weight, Sex**

25, 6 '4, 206 (though this fluctuates a lot from 204-210), male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Volleyball and sprinting are my major sports. I have played basketball for my high school and played baseball at the provincial level. When i was younger (highschool) I did track and field at the provincial level. Volleyball, I've played at the provincial level for various clubs, and national level for my university. I was looking to go pro but I have messed up my shoulder pretty hard and it doesn't let me play at a high level for too long.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I was always the skinny, tall kid who could jump really high and run really fast. When I was a kid I used to challenge my friends that I'd win a race where I'd sprint and they'd be on a bicycle. I usually won. I was always an athlete. You put me into any sport and with some practice I'd be pretty darn good. I got into volleyball because of a girl. She was on the womens team and I wanted to get to meet her and that's how I found volleyball. I was tall, so I made the team easily. Then my vertical started going down at about the age of 17 and I was very concerned as to why. I asked my basketball coach and she said that as weight increase you have to keep your strength up. As you get older, you get weaker. So this made me want to start working out to maintain my vertical. And i was tired of being the lanky kid. After high school, volleyball was my key to get into a good university and I haven't looked back since.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

This is gonna sound like bragging. I have a 40"" running vertical and a 28"" standing vertical. I am pretty much one of the highest leapers in Canada, volleyball wise. I do have some pics, but they are not taken at the peak of my vertical. There are times when I jump from the backrow and I can see the attack line on the other side of the court over the net. If you've played volleyball, you'll know how impossible that sounds, but it's true.

Other than that, I'm not a lifter, I'm an athlete. I only lift to help my goals. My current numbers are:

Back Squat: 345lbs - I go to parallel

Front squat: 295lbs - All the way down, I haven't full squatted lately 
because of meniscus damage

Box squat to parallel: 385lbs

Regular Deadlift: 405lbs - double overhand, hook grip, I don't like 
mixing my grip

Snatch grip deadlift: 315lbs - again, double overhand hook grip

Incline Bench: 95lbs (Dumbbells, I don't press with the bar)

I don't military press and very rarely push press because of my shoulder. As a volleyball player it's really hard to press in the vertical plane because of the adaptations your shoulder goes through. I also very rarely go to 1RM because I don't see a need to, I'm not gonna be competing in lifting anytime soon.
Volleyball wise, what I'm proud of is:

I have packed a guy off a jump serve

I have slammed (blocked) a guy so straight down that he landed on 
the ball. Didn't sprain his ankle though.

I have hit over a 6 '8 guy who plays for Team Canada.

I also get higher than most 6 '8 guys when I play. This was a shocker to me.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Maintaining my vertical, getting faster and stronger and staying out of injury. I want to get my shoulders and knees fixed. I've got pretty much every shoulder and knee problem you can think of.
Lifting wise, I want to be able to do at least 15 straight pullups, front squat in the 400's and deadlift 600. Keep in mind that I'm not built for squatting, I've got extremely long femurs and tibias.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I follow a vague version of Westside for Skinny Bastards. Vague because I like more volume in my leg days and I tweaked the program a bit to allow for my weak areas. I've got every stereotypical athlete weakness like weak scapula retractors and weak external rotators. Right now I've given up full squatting for more back squatting as it keeps the stress off of my knees and I'm focusing more on my posterior chain strength.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I keep it clean nowdays. No pop and as little junk food as possible. I don't worry too much about my diet because I'm not trying to lose weight. I like my weight where it is, I can probably stand to gain another 10lbs but meh. I eat a lot though. For breakfast I'd have 2 bagels, 2 eggs and a bowl of oats. I normally have two lunches, one at 1 and one at 3.30ish which'll mostly conist of rice. And then a dinner at around 8 that consists of more rice. It doesn't sound like much but it is a lot.
I take fish oils, Vitamin D and whey. Sometimes when I feel that my weight is fluctuating too much I'll switch to a weight gainer to bring my weight back to 210. I've got the metabolism of a ferret, I've got to take weight gainer just to maintain my weight.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I really like the one that goes something like ""If you're not training right now, there's somebody else who is. And when you meet him, he will beat you."" Sums up a lot of my experiences.
A couple of ones I also like are ""The worst thing I can be is the same as everyone else."" and ""Many a man has failed because he had his wishbone where his backbone should have been.""

**What challenges do you face?**

Myself. I am my biggest threat in that I will stop myself from doing something because of the fear of failing or looking like a fool. Other than that, it's just keeping my body healthy and uninjured

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I watch olympic lifting videos. If that doesn't motivate you, nothing will. Other than that, I tell myself that if I can squat 400, girls will come flocking to me. No seriously, I do. And then there's the mirror. Biggest motivator ever.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I've been lucky in this in that I have support from my family and friends because they like lifting too.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take any advice. I don't care if a 90lb girl comes up to me in the gym and tells me I'm squatting wrong. Hey maybe she saw something I didn't. If it sounds like nonsense, I'll say thanks, and do my own thing. If it makes sense, I will try it. I don't get why people get all mad if somebody points out a flaw. If my knees are buckling, I don't care who says it...
I ignore diet advice right now because I don't really care about it. I'm at around 13% bodyfat (though it looks more like 8 because of my muscle mass) and right now I couldn't care about what I eat. This will change soon however. I also ignore anybody that spouts dogma. Things like knees should not extend toes or you should always go all the way down on squatting. If a person doesn't think before he says something, I will normally ignore it or argue it out.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I think box squats for tall people are the bomb. When i stopped box squatting and focused solely on back and front squatting, none of my lifts went up. Now that I'm back into box squatting, my other lifts are going up. I think Dave Tate is fully right when he says that a squat is all about the hamstrings and glutes, and not the quads. I know Wendler has said that a box squat doesn't turn over to a back squat but I disagree. There's a reason that DeFranco has all his athletes box squatting.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**
Uhm...I squat a lot. Like sometimes 3 days a week. People ask me how I jump so high and I tell them it's because I work hard at it. Other than that I'm fairly fundamental. I would not give my workouts to anybody else though, I have ADD when it comes to working out and my plan has to change every other week or so otherwise I'll do something drastic. I've been known to go in and do 1 1/2 hours of front squats and call it a day.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Shoulders, knees and ankles. Injury risks with my sport is mostly concerning the shoulder and secondly the knee. You swing all the time and you jump all the time. It catches up to you. The very lucky few who don't get problems are the ones whom you see in the pro leagues.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**
For the shoulders, stop benching with a barbell. Stop doing anything with a barbell. Secondly, stop pressing in the overhead plane. There's a lot more to this but those two will cut down your pain a lot.
For the knees, it depends. Learn to box squat and love your single leg exercises.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Anything by Eric Cressey, Gray Cook, Charles Poliquin, Bill Hartman, Pavel Tsatsouline, Steve Maxwell and Joe Defranco. Heck too many to name.

**Anything else you want to add?**

If you want to increase your vertical, get your front squat numbers up. I think that that's the number one exercise that carries over. Number two would be a tie between box squats and back squats. Then comes deadlift variations. Don't focus too much on plyometrics because you want to avoid joint overuse injuries. Once or twice a week doing plyometrics is ample.

Alright, so the meet is over. First, before I give the report, I need to ~~give blame~~ say thanks to some people:

* shortkid: meet prep/advice/template for this report.
* triplewithcheese: Form advice and meet prep/advice
* threewhitelights: Form advice
* silverhydrates: Answering my ""Does choline affect sleep"" question *(Answer is no BTW)*

Just kidding, your guys' advice was great and I thank you very much. I have my own stupidity to thank for feeling disappointed.

I guess it started right after my last meet just 4 weeks ago. I saw the numbers these guys were doing and I wanted to try my hand at super loading my squat for partial reps. Well, it helped my CNS, but I it basically KO'd my lower back and for better part of the last 4 weeks, I've been working around the fatigue of that.

Also, I believe I didn't have the proper form because from then on, my right knee's tendonitis was really a bitch. However, I think I solved how to fix that on a regular basis.*(more later)*

Also, my gym locker rooms have been under construction for like 6 weeks, so 50% of days it's open for men &lt; 3pm and 50% &gt; 4pm *(1 hour buffer)*. Making a regular routine quite difficult. I managed to work around this quite well, but it meant I really couldn't count on the exact same meet prep as last time.

Lastly, I thought I gave myself a Hernia 3 weeks ago, so I didn't do any heavy DLing (anything greater than ~350lbs) until the week before *(after I saw a doctor).*

After all that bullshit, I was still set to have a good meet imo. I wanted to hit 1100, but I was worried about my squat *(and overconfident in my DL)* so I didn't really have a gameplan in place. Why was I worried about my squat? 10 days before I was going to practice my opener and maybe even see if I could PR. Did a couple sets of pause squats to parallel at 275 and then did 305 for 1 full rep and my right knee really hurt. Well, I decided to stop and it was aching me really bad for the next week. Stairs, bent too long on train, etc. Then something hit me, ""Maybe it's muscle tightness?"" 

So I rolled the fuck out of my quads, knees and shins the next two days. Probably an hour total. Slow, all my weight, massive pain, no tenseness, rolling from top down. Sure enough, about 95% of the pain went away, but I was still worried because I hadn't felt any pain at all before that 305 squat. ""Maybe I'll just have to take a low opener so I can at least total."" etc. So, again I didn't really make a plan on how to hit 500kg. Which was stupid, but more on lessons learned at the end.

Then the kicker - Friday before. Watching shortkid on the webcam and I start to feel that tickle in the back of your throat the tells you your getting sick. *ugh* Spent the next couple days fighting that off with massive amounts of green tea and overdosing on my supplements. 

We got there Sat afternoon so we decided to check out the afternoon squats. It was total madness. There were over 100 lifters in 90 &amp; 100kg men's classes *plus* the women. The room was packed with several hundred people and they had **three** platforms running with 3 flights on all. The heavy hitters were up front so I saw 220lb guy grind out a 600.8lb squat. He looked quite depleted afterward and was walking funny. I had hoped he didn't hurt himself like they guy a few mins before who looked to pull a muscle on a 500+ attempt. The one other notable thing about the afternoon was I saw a guy unrack ~530lb squat, go down and he fucking collapsed and dumped the bar forward. Was really scary, and the entire room stood up to check him out. Thankfully he got right up and walked away from it looking more embarrased and pissed off than hurt.

Afternoon impression: This is some serious shit! 

We couldn't stay because I wanted to just rest some more and work off my ill feeling...Went to bed on Sat around 9:30 and popped a Nyquil to help me sleep in addition to 2g Choline, 3 doses of Mg dose, 5.4g fish oil *(second of the day)* and Melatonin.

Woke up Sunday morning feeling not bad but a bit tired. Didn't feel sick at least. Took a nice hot shower to loosen up and headed down for gear check and weigh-ins.

There would be two platforms and two flights each. I was with the Masters and Juniors following the women and the Open guys had two flights on their own platform.

**Squats**

It took me a really long time to warmup on squats as I still felt rickety and testing my knee. I probably did too much warm-up, but I always go with the mantra, 'If you still feel tight, keep lifting a couple things' My open was going to be 325 and I wanted to know how my knee felt. 275 warmups were good, so I saw a 315 on a rack and did one. Felt good, but worried if too much weight would affect me. I felt the knowledge was worth the cost of energy. Besides I was sucking down espresso like there was going to be a shortage.

Went out for the opener and holy shit, it's John Bogart as the main spotter. He's the WR holder in bench I met at the last meet so that was a great surprise and nice motivation. I did the 325 but it felt sluggish. I was hoping that it was just a CNS thing and not a, ""you're still sick"" thing. I decided to try a PR, so I picked 2.5kg over my last one and ground it out pretty good. I had a pie in the sky target of 375, but I also remembered that one of my goals since Jan 1 was to squat 365 before my birthday in Oct. I decided to go with 369 instead so I could hit that goal now and be safe about it. 

Nailed it w/ some room to spare. Over all squats went great! How about that?

....that's when the stupid began.

**Bench**

I had in my mind pre-meet I was going to go for 303lbs on my second. Go for the PR. Go big...bah. Not thinking about adjusting if needed to.  My opener was 286.5 and it felt ok and a bit sluggish. Knowing that same thing just happened on squats I still went for 303, but the pause bench is really a bitch and this ref was really long on the pause. I fought the 303 for probably 4-5 secs before I finally fatigued and had to get the spot. I thank the ref for giving me that long to try though. 

Well, from that bench onward, I was spent. I think it was a combo of the coffee wearing off and the extra effort from squat PR and bench attempt and still being a little ill. I failed the third bench before I even stepped up to it because I knew I was drained and had serious doubt. *(same 303lbs. You cannot move down in weight once you pick. Only the opener can be adjusted up to a certain point.)*

**Deadlift**

Warmups felt ok, but again, I was feeling rundown. I was eating snickers and jerky and drinking Powerade and ON and everything I could think of to get some energy. I saw I needed 202.5kgs to get 500. I had it in my mind I could DL 460 since I rack pulled 500 just one week prior from below the knees. So I felt the 445 was not too out of the question. My opener felt tough. I debated on my second for a *long* time and hubris got the best of me. Went for 440.

I thought I had it. Got it off the ground and started to strain but still moving it. Then the stars came. ""Fuck you stars, I can fight through you. I'm almost to the lockout zone where my glutes can take over..."" Well, I couldn't. I lasted about 1-2 secs after they showed up, put the weight down and felt *absolutely dead*. Put everything I had into it. I almost declined the third attempt as I knew I wasn't going to make it and my hammies where screaming at me on the last one too. But I tried anyway and barely got it off the ground.

In the end I totalled exactly what I did in my last meet.

**Takeaways**

Don't be fucking stupid. 

Hindsight is 20/20 but here are the main points.

* Meet bench is not touch and go bench. Always go for a meet PR first. If it's also your personal PR, so be it. Had I gone for 297.5, I would have gotten it for sure and added 11lbs to my total.
* Unless you have recently lifted well over your meet PR in any lift, second attempt should be 2.5-5kg over your last meet PR.
* Don't be a hero. Had I just gone for a DL PR of 424.2, I would have gotten it. It may have given me the confidence and energy boost I needed to hit 430-435 and get my 500 total in conjunction with the bench lesson above.
* Come in with a plan for both good and bad days. Period.
* Bring more espresso. Lots more...
* Maxing out three lift s in 2-3 hours is **rough**. I was soooo dead after and the rest of the day. My DOMS today is not bad as I ate a shitload of crap throughout the day yesterday.
* I continue to be blown away by the strength out there. The speed in the warm up rooms of the Open guys doing the 3-400lb warmups was insane. Really motivates me.
* Master's competitors continue to surprise the fuck out of me. The small guy who looked the least muscley and most beer bellied of all was lifting 500-600lb in squat and DL and 400+ in bench. I mean seriously, dude, where is your muscle? This guy must have been the epitome of wirey strong.

http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/effects-of-moderate-intensity-endurance-and-high-intensity-intermittent-training-on-anaerobic-capacity-and-vo2-max.html

&gt;Finally, I’d note that, as I discussed in Predictors of Endurance Performance VO2 max is only one of many components of overall performance, and it’s not even the most important one.  Of more relevance here, VO2 max and aerobic endurance are not at all synonymous, many people confuse the two because they don’t understand the difference between aerobic power (VO2 max) and aerobic capacity (determined primarily by enzyme activity and mitochondrial density within the muscle).  Other studies have shown clearly that interval work and steady state work generate different results in this regards, intervals improve VO2 max but can actually decrease aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase) within skeletal muscle.

* 1. Is there any way in which moderate intensity steady state cardio is superior to HIIT?

 2. What does 28% increased anaerobic capacity really mean?

 3. Are tabatas really worthwhile considering they are only proven to increase VO2 max slightly more than steady state cardio and maybe not even more than doing 30 minutes of regular HIIT? Or have their been any new studies using tabata like protocols?

 4. In the T Nation article he specifies High Intensity Anaerobic Interval Training and High Intensity Aerobic Interval Training.

[5/3/1 or other programs]",38,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/id8q0/whats_your_approach_to_a_deload_week_531_or_other/,"So I'm coming up on my second deload week as prescribed in the 5/3/1 program, but I've found myself a bit confused by the whys and hows of it. I have a few questions and I was hoping you'd share your thoughts and how *you* approach your deloads.  
  
* **Why lift at all instead of taking a week off completely?** If the point is to recover, I'm assuming sub-maximal sets help us maintain strength, ROM, and mobility, but wouldn't a week off entirely allow for better recovery?  
  
* **On a deload week, should we be eating:** A) **Less** because there's no need for the usual surplus? B) **More** to provide all the nutrition possible to maximize recovery? C) **Maintenance** because neither A nor B are correct? D) Have I missed something?  
  
* **Is *hypertrophy* still a valid (or possible) goal on the deload week?** Wendler recommends deloading the assistance work as well as the work sets, but since the assistance work is already at sub-max load, what's the point of even doing multiple higher-rep sets of even lighter weight? Can hypertrophy still occur? Is that the point? Specifically I'm referring to the **Boring But Big** sets since that's what I do as *hypertrophy*.
  
* **Do you change the routine at all *aside* from from lowering the weight?** If yes, mind sharing why?  
  
I'm just curious to see what everyone on here does during that week. Personally, I see it as a good time to do a mini cut, with means I cut carbs on all days, including days on which I lift to drop a bit of body fat, but I wonder if that defeats the purpose since I'm technically *stressing* my body by not providing adequate nutrition for full recover.  
  
So how do you handle your deload weeks, A-Team?

More specifically, I was reading [this](http://www.amazon.com/Mike-Mentzer-Heavy-Duty-Nutrition/dp/B001M5JFTE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350799117&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mike+mentzer+heavy+duty+nutrition)  and the gist of what he says is: 'If we all gained 10lbs of lean muscle this year we would need to consume 600 (the number of calories in a pound of muscle) X 10 (the number of pounds of muscle growth stimulated), or 6,000 calories a year over and above the maintenance.  Not 6,000 extra calories a day, a week, or a month, but a *year* . . .If you discover that your daily average caloric maintenance need is 3,000 you need to consume 3016 calories a day in order to gain 10 pounds of *lean* muscle a year.  Again, those 16 extra calories a day will add up to the 6,000 extra we need for the year.'

Obviously there is a bit more to it than that, but that's the long and the short of it.  And it does seem sensible to me; not to say that eating tons of food wouldn't work, because it does, but those extra calories will turn into fat, and I am asking specifically about gaining lean muscle mass not just mass.  He also makes a pretty good point that just because a muscle is 70% water doesn't mean athletes are drinking copious amounts of water in order to build more lean muscle mass.  Lastly, although he did use steroids in his prime, after his professional bodybuilding career he had a personal training business, and his many clients utilized his principles, presumably with success, so let's avoid the 'he used steroids so of course he'd gain mass on an inadequate diet' comments, and stick with the cold, mathematical, facts.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_11u1j6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/11u1j6/how_necessary_is_it_to_gorge_oneself_on_food_in/,

This was three years ago in my ""[super fat](http://imgur.com/LUAK9)"" stage. [Current](http://imgur.com/TJfXb). Obviously, I still have weight to lose and the more I add to this, the more I feel woefully out of place here. :/ 

**Age?** 34 **Sex?** Female. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

Boxing. Running. Muay Thai. Snowboarding. No - I only compete at things that I'm going to win otherwise, I get really annoyed. I'm not an expert at any of these activities.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

My story is more about my weight than about fitness, specifically. I had become very depressed, was in a relationship that had ended well prior to the date that it actually ended and I had gained a tonne of weight - I was 320 lbs and couldn't do anything. My quality of life was really terrible. I got out of the relationship and started going to the gym and changing my eating habits somewhat. I was using the eliptical and doing isolation exercises and really had no clue what I was doing but I did lose weight - about 60lbs in one year.

I changed gyms to this scruffy, dirty boxing gym last February. They do that whole ""first trainer session free"" thing so I took the session even though I thought trainers were a complete waste of time but I actually learned some stuff so I signed up for some sessions. The trainer was partly on the right track, partly not but at the same time, I started doing a lot of reading, found my way to r/fitness and read a lot about weight lifting. I would get the trainer to teach me how to do certain free weight exercises and he seemed enthusiastic about that so I read more and did more on my own.

Since February of last year, I've lost another 70lbs or so. I gave up weighing myself regularly a long time ago. Way too obsessive and would bum me out if I didn't see the results I wanted to.

In September, I decided that any trip I took (and I travel a lot) would have to involve something really physical as well so I climbed Mount Toubkal in Morocco - the highest peak in North Africa. That was really an incredible experience from being a person who couldn't even walk to work and never wanted to leave the house to climbing a mountain.
When I got back, I decided that I was going to learn snowboarding in the winter - I was small enough that I could try it again. I went snowboarding almost every weekend from Jan-March and by the end of the winter, I didn't completely suck. I'm probably the only person in Canada who was sad when winter ended.

What I've done isn't much compared to so many other people but I continue to amaze myself. That counts for something.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

I ran a 5K last week. I've signed up for the Warrior Dash, a 5k in August and I'm planning on a 10k in September.

My successes come every few months when I realize I'm stronger, faster and more agile than I was before and being physical is generally getting easier - or, more accurately, I can push myself to do more.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

5-6 days a week which involves lifting days (squats, dls, military press, bench press, low rows, assisted pull ups, weighted lunges or bulgarian split squats and ab work [plank variations, kick ups, etc.]), cardio days (mostly just running now) and boxing classes.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet is clean about 90% of the time but most of my friends are sedentary which means when I spend time with them, I drink beer and eat burgers...social isolation sucks. I'm trying to find more people who want to do active things and that I actually like their personality...this is proving a bit difficult; I'm pretty choosy about who I spend my time with.

I should note that I've been losing and gaining the same ten pounds for the last three months. I did a bit of a mental inventory a few weeks ago and have been kicking my ass and being more vigilant. I'd like to move into maintenance by the end of the summer; that would be so great.

A typical day food-wise:

breakfast - a slice of crustless quiche (eggs, spinach, mushrooms, fake bacon, cheese) and a soy shake (soy milk, greek yogurt, some kind of fruit)

lunch - deconstructed cabbage rolls (chopped cabbage, ground turkey, tomatoes) carrots and greek yogurt dip egg

dinner - turkey sausage and broccoli

I'm a calorie counter and eat lower carb but I'm not afraid of our friend, bread and other tasty carbs. I just don't end up eating them regularly right now.

My only supplements are fish oil and calcium/magnesium.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

I'm currently running a 30 min 5K. My squat and DL are about the same - squats 5X5 115 on the last set, my DL on a 5X5 is also 115lbs. Based on some advice in here, I'm going to change my DL routine and see if I can get my number higher. Upate: My DL is up to 125 with super shitty form. Yay!

My military press truly is the saddest thing you'll ever see - 50lbs. Oh, the bar looks sooooo cute with 2 1/2lbs on either side. They should be pink. Update: now it's 55 lbs.

My bench is 85lbs. Low row is 105lbs. 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

The only person you're ever really competing with is yourself so constantly try and outdo yourself and if you have a day where you suck, take the next one off - that's your body telling you you need a break. 

**What challenges do you face?**

My weight will always be my biggest challenge. 

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I don't know. Being active is just a part of my life now. Losing weight and seeing the who I was under all that fat is also part of the motivator. No longer being invisible is also a motivator. Knowing that regardless of how tired or pissed off I am, I'll be in a much better frame of mind once I've done something active - especially running. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

There are no naysayers in my life with the exception of one person who's opinion doesn't matter to me. However, it is a significant issue with my social group where beer is the tie that binds. I go out and drink with them on Friday nights (my cheat day) and just enjoy myself. But I talk a lot about what I'm doing in the hopes that I'll motivate them to become active too. It's worked on some of them. 

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Anyone who's militant in their advice - i.e. people who push vibrams or keto or whatever, I'm not really interested in...I'm more interested in generally in just experimenting and finding out what's going to work for me - i.e. keep me challenged and interested.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

Eating less carbs makes me less hungry. Cardio is an essential part of being fit and healthy. I learn better by doing rather than reading.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I make competitions for myself with rewards and penalties. I.e. If I stop to walk during a run I have to either run longer or do other cardio if I'm at the gym. If I beat a record, I might have desert or some other reward. 

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I was in an accident when I was a kid. I sometimes have weird pain in my pelvis as a result - sometimes from running or just generally when it rains. I have balance issues and some mobility/discomfort issues for odd one-off kind of things. Mountain climbers are super uncomfortable for me. Any pressure on my hip bones is also very uncomfortable. Luckily, there is very minimal interference in my ability to do almost all activities and I used to get pain more regularly than I do now. I attribute that to being so active.

I also have morton's neuroma and fallen metatarsal arches. I wear orthodics as a result. 

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Well, my stupid injury is pretty much unique to me so other than ""listen to what you're body is telling you."" no, not really. As for the stupid foot issues, the only advice I can impart is that yes, wearing 4-inch heels does exacerbate the problem. There's a big fucking surprise. 

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I've read, ""Lifting for Women."" That was a great book. Other than that, it's mostly a ""do"" not ""read"" thing for me. 

**Anything else you want to add?**

I'm feeling pretty humble to be included in this group of elite athletes and I hope this was interesting for presenting a different perspective.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_i54k7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/i54k7/member_spotlight_drapple/,

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Weight lifting (four times a week), semi-competitive rowing (men’s recreational level, summers), recreational volleyball, bicycling (work commute, summers).

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

The short of it: 22 years of laziness and inactivity, spending most of my time in front of a computer monitor. When I was graduating university (at 20), I found myself about 50 pounds overweight from chicken bacon ranch sandwiches and late-night eating in the computer labs, which prompted me to join a gym and begin sprinting with some random air-powered Nautilus machine exercises thrown in. I didn’t gain any muscle whatsoever, but I got lean very quickly (155-160 pounds – yeah, at 6’4”).

I maintained this weight for a long while. In 2009, in my quest to impress my girlfriend’s father (who was a national-level rower in Europe many years ago), I discovered a new summer passion. I’d be out on the water four times a week. I wouldn’t think about my diet, which bordered on malnutrition, but I did very well with improving technique and even won some rec-level regattas.

After the summer of 2009, I wanted to get stronger for the sport, so I began Stronglifts with ½ GOMAD. I couldn’t bench (the bar was heavy), I couldn’t squat (horrible hamstring inflexibility and quarter-squats), and I couldn’t do proper pullups worth anything. An epic 45 pound bulk, a quick switch to Starting Stength, and 3 or 4 months later, I was looking and lifting a hell of a lot stronger; I was deadlifting three plates for reps, my squat had improved to parallel at 3x5x235, and I was benching about 325% more than before. I ripped my first pair of jeans sitting down (definitely not the first time).
After that little stint, I began experimenting with diet, supplementation, and programming. A new passion was born (mostly spawned from an addictive personality).

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m one of those people that has goals, but doesn’t like to disclose them. Sure, I’d like to be stronger, but who doesn’t? I do make sure to have workout, short-term, and long-term goals, but I find that they change often and it doesn’t make much sense to make it public. There’s a good TED talk about that somewhere.
I did once say “I want to be the grandpa that does backflips”. I’ll leave it at that.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Wendler’s 5/3/1 with boring but big/triumvirate/volume accessories. Lots of hip thrusts, pulls-ups, ring work, kettlebell exercises, ab wheel rollouts, dragon flags, and dips. I have my own basement gym that I call The Iron Garden (I posted about it somewhere here) and that I expand often (I just got myself a pair of rings and play with them often; got a GymBoss for interval training a few weeks ago; a while back I bought a nice 53-pound kettlebell). Next up: a better deadlift station. My workouts are usually posted on Fitocracy.
Other than two vacations, I have never missed a single day of training. If I tell myself that I’m going to go three days a week, I’m sure-as-hell going to go three days that week.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I’m following the one pre-workout meal Leangains protocol with a milder version of carb-backloading and low-carb off days (a “Cheat Mode” variation). I track calories and usually fall under 120F/225P/80C on off-days, 80F/200P/250C on workout days.
I eat heavy dairy post-workout. I live on cottage cheese. I eat tons of broccoli (bag lady’s exact quote from last week’s trip to the grocery store: “HOLY SHIT that’s a lot of broccoli). I eat berries in pounds. I love oats more than my own family.
Daily supplements: 15g liquid fish oil, 5000IU vitamin D, whey protein (flavouring my oatmeal or cottage cheese), 6g beta-alanine, 5g creatine, 650mg DMAE, 600mg caffeine, 72mg ephedrine, Psyllium husk.

Sometimes supplements: melatonin, multi-vitamin, DMAA, BCAAs (fasted training).

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

I’m very-much a beginner in this sport. I’m constantly readjusting, relearning, reevaluating my form. My deadlift currently stands at 430x1 (late November, probably closer to 1x450 or higher if I tested it now), squat is at 255x8 (adjusting to a new wide-stance form; I’ll be going for a new tested 1RM in a few weeks), weighted pull-ups at 2x90lbs (did these for the first time on Friday), overhead press is at 155x5 (couple weeks ago), Kroc rows are at 115x20, weighted dips at 60x8 (though they’re starting to feel easy).
With rowing, the fastest I’ve done is a 1:32 split for 500 metres. Nothing spectacular for competitive people, I’m sure, but good for a rec dude like me.

I don’t really care about numbers all that much. I find I’m much more competitive with myself than I’d ever be with another person. I did care, back when I was starting out; I’d brag to my friend about my three plate deadlift and I’d feel superior for a few minutes. Now, all I care about now is that extra five pounds this workout. If I can conquer that, then I leave the gym a happy man. I realize now that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses; different lever lengths and muscle insertions: it’s silly to compare myself to anyone else.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

There are a few quotes that I like to share around Fittit a lot. I’m sure you’ve seen me post them. Together, they create my training philosophy. ""Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination are omnipotent. The slogan ‘press on’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."" - Calvin Coolidge

“Sooner or later we all discover that the big moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these. You were born an original. Don't die a copy. There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.” 
- Susan B. Anthony 

“No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training…what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” – Socrates

“It is better to be a warrior in the garden than a gardener at war.” – Japanese proverb

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit."" - Aristotle

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I’m with Scottydog on this: I don’t have to. I do it because I love it. I don’t eat well or train hard because I force myself to do it; I do those things because it’s frakkin’ awesome.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I’ve only ever had issues with explaining my diet to others. If they accept my offer to see the studies, I’ll give them the literature/Pubmed links. If not, then they usually forget about it pretty quickly. With training, it’s usually more of a “Dude, what program should I do?!”, followed by “you should probably do Starting Strength, brah”, followed by him doing squats once. It’s a neverending cycle with friends who want results but don’t have the mindset to get them. I'm thinking that addictive personality helps.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

It was always incredibly difficult for me to take advice; I was always so stubborn and know-it-all I’d get offended if someone had an opposing view.

It took me a while to learn to accept advice with open arms. I’ll listen to anyone, try and take an objective view, and if I see their point-of-view/advantages of their advice, I’ll usually try it out. I certainly would have never tried Leangains, 5/3/1, or keto without an open mind.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

A lot of the time, it’s not all in my head. So many workouts I’ve walked up to the squat rack with Angry Bear mode turned on and failed. Some days you have it, some days you don’t.
I love strength followed by volume when cutting. It’s the shit. I’ve never had my arms grow so quickly, let alone when losing weight.
Taking a week off can set me back a month or two in squatting. I don’t know why. Everything else is fine.
Loud instrumental progressive metal or heavy post-rock is the best music to work out to.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Most of what I do I steal from others. My programming/diet is a cut-and-paste of dozens of things that I’ve come across. Leangains, carb backloading, anabolic diet, timed carb diet, 5/3/1, Texas Method, keto diets, GOMAD, paleo, kettlebell stuff, Mediterranean diet, Cheat Mode, Gymnastics Bodies, a hundred different blog posts, Fittit posts, etc., etc.

I think that might be something that I’m doing a little differently: I’m always changing something small until I get the most optimal solution. I call it... Zahrada’s Natural Selection Diet and Fitness Program. Wait, no. We don’t need that.

I have also trained naked, just to see what it was like. It was weird, even alone.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Some minor tendonitis from crappy squat form, but that’s about it. I also got an oar to the face once which gave me a nice gash. Crabbing out at 40 strokes a minute – there’s a lot of power in that piece of wood.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I fear the day that I’m injured. I know I’d have to hold myself back, but the thought scares me.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I read a couple dozen blogs from people that are smarter than me in hopes of finding things to try. Most of the books that I’ve read on fitness are listed in the Fittit FAQ.

**Anything else you’d like to add?**
As a taller, younger lifter, I find it incredible that we live in a time and age where there’s so much information and dialogue. I hate to be so pretentious about it, but it’s truly a marvel that we can collaborate on such a large scale and help ourselves to get to our goals; I think we need to value it much more.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_g8tro,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/g8tro/member_spotlight_zahadra/,

My question is:

**Is there any evidence, apart from my own anecdotal evidence, that would suggest that strenuous, heavy lifting would decrease ADHD symptoms?**

Some additional information:

* 20yo female
* usually weight training (olympic, powerlifting) 4-6 days per week, 3-8 mile runs 2x/week, pick-up basketball whenever my schedule permits
* I am prescribed 10mg adderall/2x daily.

Basically, it just feels like there's this huge abundance of noise in my head. Sometimes, it's even exhausting and overwhelming to get started for the day: the sensation is analogous to having someone interrupt you while you count. Lectures are particularly hard for me to concentrate during, and I usually end up having to just self-teach the majority of the material. I routinely lose things. Behavioral interventions only work to a certain extent.

**However:** doing very heavy, compound lifts seems to mitigate results similar to adderall for me, at least for a short time. I wouldn't say it's due to physical exhaustion (i.e. I just don't have enough ""energy"" to be hyperactive, because hyperactivity, although it is a problem, is hardly what I struggle with the most). It honestly feels like the ""interruptions"" or ""noise"" is almost eliminated for ~30-60 minutes, and then is lessened for the remainder of the day.

Other things that have worked for me include coffee and also, strangely, I had no symptoms while I was struggling with a life-threatening eating disorder (which hugely perpetuated that whole problem).


My hypothesis is that CNS fatigue is directly correlated with a reduction in ADHD symptoms. I'm wondering what all of these things have in common, and if there are other ways of replicating them without the use of stimulants or self-imposed starvation.

EDIT: I should add that although I enjoy running, it does not produce the same effects as weight lighting regarding concentration and general ""peacefulness"" in my head.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,1360871856.0,,,True,t3_18j1f6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/18j1f6/weight_training_cns_fatigue_and_reduction_of_adhd/,

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Olympic weightlifting is my sport. I mostly compete at club and state level, but I've also been in a national club and an international competition this year (the latter thanks to a favourable rule for locals).

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

In my middle years at highschool I bought Arnold's New Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. Before long I was at a local gym doing all sorts of stuff, most of it ineffective. I knew next to nothing and didn't eat enough and so on. But I grew bigger and stronger. I miss teen testosterone: I could frown at a rack of weights and get stronger.
To his credit Arnold really values of the squat and so I was squatting from the start.

When I first got to university, I kept up my fiddly routines of 4 different shoulder exercises, 2 bicep exercises etc ... plus squats ... and I lived on campus so I walked everywhere. The walking caused me to lose lots of weight. For the first time, girls stopped admiring my Great Personality.

Then depression struck. It blew my life to pieces, costing me the last decade or so in lost time. I spent most of that lost time sitting on my bum getting fat.

Then I wanted to impress a girl, so I headed back to the gym. 4 shoulder exercises, 2 biceps exercises etc. The results were not amazing, but it started to remind me of how much I enjoyed the act of training.

I came across StrongLifts 5x5 and switched to that. I probably put on more visible muscle in the first 3 months of that than I had in the previous 18 months of fiddly exercising.

Finally, I read about O-lifting on T-nation and thought ""I'd love to add that to my mix. I'll go to the local Oly gym for a few weeks, learn how to do it, then come back to my regular gym"".
That was about 2 years ago.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My goal this year is to make a 300kg total in competition. I'd also like to push my squat past 250kg.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

It depends very much on what competitions are coming up. Competitive Oly lifters tend to program backwards from desirable competitions they can enter. I only started doing this in the past 6 months for the national club comp and the Arafura Games.
Right now I'm between coaches. My coach here has moved away. I live, work and (try) to study in Darwin. I will be moving back to Perth to finish my degree. I'll return to my first Oly gym then.
Since there's no more major comps this year I am aiming to get stronger as fast as possible.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I am trying cheatmode at the moment, not perfectly mind. I have lots of food that I cook in bulk and store: bolognese, taco beef, curries, frozen chicken. Lately I am trying to eat more vegetables. One big bowl of salad with every dinner. I keep boiled eggs around for post-training snacks on heavy days.

I take this twice per day:

6x fish oil tablet (1g) 1x multi 1x CoQ10 1x glucosamine (500mg)

At night I add:

1x milk thistle 2x 22mg zinc tablet, 4x if it's a training day.

During training I have a 3 litre bottle with gatorade powder and dextrose, 5 teaspoons each. I sweat buckets during full-on Oly sessions and cramp up viciously without the gatorade. I started adding dextrose because I was giving off a literally eye-watering ammonia stench during training.

After training I have a whey shake. Three scoops, low fat milk, with a scoop of dextrose and a spoon each of psylium husk and wheat germ.
My rule for supplements is that they should be cheap. Probably my only non-negotiable is fish oil, it keeps my knees from becoming sore.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Surprisingly poor this year. I raced up to 240kg in three competitions and I've been stuck there for about 6 months.

I think it's largely psychological, especially on snatches. I've pulled 120kg without really feeling challenged -- but dropped it because I wasn't properly positioned and tight. Similarly with cleans, I've cleaned 130kg but I've power cleaned 125kg without really feeling challenged. I think I'm strong enough to lift 130/150 at least.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I've learned in competition that you can be too relaxed and you can be too psyched-up. It's about finding that intense focus in the middle somewhere. The thing about Oly lifting is that you can't ""cram"" it. Every competition total is earned in the months of work leading up to it. No one session makes the difference. It's cumulative.

Another thing is how easily small things can throw you out. Going into the club nationals I felt I'd pull 120/140. I discovered on a Friday I'd be lifting on Saturday instead of Sunday. On the day I got into an argument with my coach about my starting lifts. These small things threw me off and I posted a disappointing total after busting my butt for 8 weeks coming in.

When there's a good coach in hand, training largely revolves around doing what they say, but giving useful feedback. Obedience and helpfulness.

**What challenges do you face?**

Firstly, age. I am too old for a truly competitive career. If I'd known about it when I was a teenager I think I could have lifted for my country.

Second is fatigue -- juggling work, study and training.

Training can be done with a certain degree of mindlessness, but work and study require me to be alert. Training and work both take it out of me, squeezing study.

Luckily I have an awesome employer. They're giving me time off starting in July to go back to Perth to finish my degree full time.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

Habit. Going the same days every week. Unless I am injured or resting up for a comp, I will go and do something. Even if I don't finish the workout, even if I suck for the whole session; at least I haven't broken the habit.

I think of habit as the capital form of willpower. You spend a lot of willpower upfront to create a habit, but after that it pays you back. If you go inconsistently, then you'll have to spend the full price of willpower each time. You'll get too many days when work has depleted your willpower and eventually you'll give up.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

My coaches get annoyed at me when I push myself too hard. I never thought I'd be the guy doing it -- I'm deferential by nature -- but you start doing more and more and you want to do more and more. But short-term you is not thinking about the fact that you're not managing fatigue. That's why coaches want you to follow the plan.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I have one trick I developed for setting the start position.
Grip the bar at your width. Rotate the elbows backwards, so that the biceps face forward. Notice how the shoulders twist and lock down, tightening the upper back. Without giving up the locked position, release your elbows so that they assume the neutral position.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've had bulged spinal discs, shoulder muscle injury and rhomboid injuries.

The classic risks for Olympic lifting are: sore knees and blown discs. The knees especially if you get into the (very bad) habit of stomping/donkey-kicking.

Blowing or bulging a disc is a possibility if you don't keep the tight lower back. If the form is right, injury is unlikely.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Don't be a spastic dipshit like me. In spite of what I said above, sometimes you shouldn't train. If you are so tired that you can't keep strict form, switch down to something like squats or quit. One week out from the Arafura games I trained after doing a weekend-long coaching course. I was a zombie and wound up injuring myself. [I still managed to compete]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/haltw/despite_injury_i_managed_to_compete_in_the_same/).

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I rather enjoy fittit. I look at t-nation sometimes. I've got a copy of Everett's book on weightlifting, which is a decent read. I also have Zatsiorsky and Kraemer, which while thin is jam-packed with amazing details.

**Anything else you want to add?**

I did not come from a sporting family and as an intellectual kid, I justified my dislike of sports by thinking that it was basically watered-down war for brutes. But lifting has taught me a lot about myself. It's also provided a useful analogy or point of view on my profession of software engineering. The value of planning, record-keeping, steady progress, constant review, constant self-review and so on. Plus I love the camraderie, the sense of defeating the immovable objects and the sense of defeating my own limitations.

39

**Sex?**

M, 5'11"", ~215-220lbs

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I lift weights, play with kettlebells and will be getting back into running soon. I do not compete at any level any more.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

It seems like my story is the opposite of most as I started playing sports and having an active lifestyle since I was about 5 when I played flag football. My dad was a huge sports fan and so that carried over to me. I played football, basketball, and tennis in High School. After high school I got into lifting weights which carried over into college. I played one year of rugby in college until they told me I needed to buy insurance, which I could not afford. That was the end of my organized athletics, but I still played intramural basketball quite a bit and honed my power forward moves in the '6 and under' leagues. :o). I even managed to play with the varsity B-Ball team quite often during the offseason and that was pretty exciting as there was generally a big crowd around to watch.

After college I pretty much lost touch with basketball as it got harder to find time to play and places to play with people I enjoyed playing with. I kept up with weights, though, and that was my main endeavor for activity with some cycling/mountain biking thrown in.

My 30s I kind of fell out of continuous practice for much of the time because of life. On for a few months, off for a few months, etc. In 2008, after running about 25-30 miles a week for a couple years, I decided I wanted to run a marathon and started training. 

Unfortunately, an old achilles injury started hurting too much once I got into the 10+ mile training runs and that had to be abandoned.
I started getting pretty serious again in late Jan last year (2010) and if you've followed /r/fitness for the last year, you pretty much know what's up with me.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

In no particular order, here are my most recent accomplishments.

* Unofficial 1/2 marathon while training for a marathon a couple years ago. (Stopped due to injury)
* 90 lb DB Turkish Get-up
* 100 TGUs in a row with 20kg kettlebell
* 275x3x5 squat but my only actual 1RM max after that was 285
* 375lb Deadlift (no belt or chalk)
* 225x13 and a 1RM of 275lb bench
* 150lbx6 OHP

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

Before Oct 24th (when I turn 40):

* TGU 110lb DB; once each hand (largest in the gym)
* OHP 185lbs
* Bench 315lbs
* Squat 365lbs
* DL 405lbs
* Pass SSST w/ a 24kg kettlebell (200+ snatches in 10mins)
* Be able to run 6-7 miles &lt; 60 mins again
* 10+ consecutive pull-ups
* &lt; 200lbs BW

Life goals

* Stay injury free
* Run a marathon (under 4:00:00)
* Continue enjoying working out and progressing as well as a 40+ man can...

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

Currently following Wendler's 5/3/1 and just kind of making up the assistance stuff on a week to week to basis. Lately I've been liking the Boring But Big because it's simple and coupled with my current diet I'm seeing more results. I use Kettlebells mostly for conditioning work or as assistance work for 5/3/1. Since I need short workouts (~60mins), Wendler's plan fits me nicely and I just work on mostly the major lifts (Squats, Deads, Bench, OHP, Dips, Pull-ups, Rows, and butt work).

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I'm kind of fast and loose with my diet. I'm old and set in my ways, but lately I have been following IF of 16/8 with a caloric limit of ~2000 cals per day. I don't always hit my goals exactly, but it's usually within 200-300 cals. Weekends are a little looser. I use the Lose It! app for my phone to keep track of food during the day. I don't believe you have to be a nutrition nazi to be healthy (but you do if you want a 6 pack). I want to lose my love handles and look good in a suit, but I don't need to be ripped. If I could get to 12-15%, I would be happy.

Until recently the only supplements I took were fish oil and some beefcake powder (whey). Since my diet sometimes sucks, I've just started taking more nutrients (Mg, Zn, Vit-D, Veggie Pills) and since I'm old and starting to get senile, looking into Nootropics (Choline now, maybe some racetams in the future). I just starting taking some Beta-Alanine, but since I've been sick lately I haven't had a long enough time to see how it affects my workouts or recovery.

I also dose with resveratrol many evenings to relax...

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Oh god. This used to be balls to the wall, push yourself to the max, etc. With age comes wisdom (and injuries) so now I take a more long term approach. (""It's a marathon, not a sprint"") That has been serving me well in the last 9 months. Not every session has to be a record or an exact set of exercises. Not every week has to be the same. This is why I like Wendler's plan so much. There have been several times when I've had to pull double duty on a day due to life. I do the two main lifts and fuck off. I'm still progressing and I don't need to feel bad about it.

**What challenges do you face?**

The life of a mid career, 39 yr old family man.

I'm a technology manager at a major investment bank and most people seem to think that making billions of dollars is more important than my workout.

I have some Scoliosis and two bulging discs my lower back.

I have some form of insomnia that prevents me from sleeping a full night most every night. The fact that my back hurts most of the time doesn't help this either.

I've also sustained quite a few injuries in my life that will act up or force me to really think about what I'm doing.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

It's fun. No motivation needed. Sorry, I don't have any great words of wisdom for this.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I guess I'm pretty fortunate in that I don't have many naysayers when it comes to the actual working out. All my office buddies exercise and think about their weight in some regard. The biggest challenge is getting my family members (both immediate and expanded) to understand that IF is ok, eggs are ok, bacon is ok, etc...

Proof is in the pudding though, and they are seeing the results, even if they are slow in coming because I'm not always so disciplined. This helps break down those barriers, but I also see it as a chance to really learn because as anyone knows, you don't really know a subject until you can explain it to someone else.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I would rather take anecdotal advice of someone I trust over scientific any day. However, I'll qualify that by saying that I have to believe I can apply to myself as well. That also doesn't mean I ignore scientific data, it just means that if the two compete, I'll take anecdotal.

I'll hang my head in shame and say I've yet to use a belt for anything, nor do I use chalk. I've been seriously thinking about these though...

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

* I'll have my best day in the gym if no one is there to witness it.
* You can replace lost sleep with extra food for a short time period (~7 days).
* I believe lifting weights has given me super fast reflexes and that it will help me stave off mental issues as I get older.
* I believe lifting weights will help me stay out of a Life Alert commercial when I get older.
* *When you think you are at your limits, you're wrong.*

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

I don't listen to music while lifting. I like being alone with my thoughts and I am good a zoning out external noises. Also, I feel I am more subdued than it seems most people are. I don't get jacked up. I don't get super pumped before a lift. I just go up there and lift the fucker after a bit of focus.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Since I was 5, injuries I have sustained while doing some kind of sporting activity (in as close to chronological order as I can remember):

* Broken elbow
* Hyper extended knee
* Severe road rash (on my face, among other body parts) with a side of 
being knocked out cold.
* About 2-3 sprains per ankle and 2-3 twists per ankle
* Broken wrist
* Broken toe
* Broken rib
* Broken noses
* Broken fingers
* Torn rotator cuff
* Pulled hamstring
* Torn Achilles
* Torn hamstring
* Wounded pride (ok, this happens all the time, not just the end)

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Go slow. See above comment about fitness being a marathon. Pushing too fast is a quick prescription for getting hurt.

When you get hurt: First, see the doctor. Second, see the doctor. For about the first 37 years of my life, tape, ice and intestinal fortitude were about the extent of my medical treatments. Now I have aches and pains everywhere. It seems like there isn't a day that goes by when there isn't at least one thing nagging me. Getting injuries treated properly is the most important advice I would recommend to anyone.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Obviously Reddit and T-Nation. I prefer to bounce ideas off a few trusted individuals than read through copious amounts of web. Although, I should start reading more.

What's a book?

**Anything else you want to add?**

See [Question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hmy7j/becoming_a_supple_leopard_by_kelly_starrett/) and [Review](http://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/1epdth/a_review_of_becoming_a_supple_leopard/).


I've read Starting Strength, and having put it into practice for a while. I've also recently started reading Becoming a Supple Leopard (BSL). I have two questions regarding technique differences arising with these methods; 

a) My lumbar positioning - the lumbar curve I'd taught myself to hold during a squat from SS, seems to be an 'overextension' according to BSL which advocates a spine neutral flat back. Is there any fundamental difference between these two or did I just mis-interpret SS?

b) Foot positioning - SS recommends a slightly wider-than-shoulder width stance, with feet pointed 30 degrees outwards. BSL suggests feet be kept parallel.

I ask this because I am just getting used to what (I think) a SS squat should feel like, and the BSL squat feels quite different. I'm happy to re-train myself if there are any advantages to my doing so, but don't want to keep darting back and forth. 

What are your thoughts on this?

Unfortunately, most of them have lacked enough information for anyone to be able to give relevant advice beyond canned responses.  
 
Posts of this sort are good; they help people learn to program properly, how to balance demands, and take things to the next level.  But without the pertinent information and diagnostics, giving useful advice is not possible.  
 
##Programming advice or critique requests must now meet the following criteria:
 
* You must include your current stats. Age, Height, Weight, and relevant PR(s) for whatever you are trying to achieve.  (These requirements are also stated in the [AF Fact Sheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_ask_for_help.3F).)  
 
* **The post must include a detailed goal**. ""I want to get stronger"" is not a detailed goal.  Specific goals require specific help, especially from people who have already achieved that goal, so that is what we want the focus to be on.  
 
 * A detailed version of ""I want to get stronger"" is ""I want to add 50lb to my squat"".  Even more detail would include a date or event by which you want to achieve that goal.  More examples, ""I have a race in July and I want to drop 5 minutes off my 10K time"" or ""I want to make the 74kg class at the upcoming Arnold's"".   *Remember, advice should not be requested here if you still have obvious beginner gains to make.*
 
* Proposed weight programs must include rep and set schemes and a progression plan.
 
* If you are engaging is multiple training modalities (e.g. triathlon training; lifting + conditioning + sport specific practice) be sure to mention it as this will enable more holistic assessments and suggestions.  
 
It stands to reason that if you want to discuss your programming in this sub, the *poster* should have a base level of programming knowledge, and the wherewithal to know how his/her body responds to certain training tactics.  As always, do your research *before* posting and ask specific questions about things you are unsure of.  The majority of comments should not be pumping OP for more information.

I wanted to share some of the interesting things I found from my time researching this topic as well as start a discussion on it.

Insulin’s effect on Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) is frequently attributed to its roll in signaling mTor and localizing nutrient uptake proteins to the surface of mytocytes (i.e. Glut 4).  While this is true, there is evidence suggesting that insulin’s  achieves its effect on MPS largely through changes in blood flow alone ([1](http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/291/4/E745.full.pdf+html), [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484484)) and that exercise may have a more potent roll in modulating blood flow then changes in insulin sensitivity ([3] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572647?dopt=Citation)).  Some background information that is relevant is that muscle tissue has two primary microvasculature pathways termed nutritive and non-nutritive.  A bit of a misnomer as there nutrient content is the same, they simply differ in that nutritive feeds myocytes while non-nutritive supplies adipocytes ([4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759589?dopt=Citation), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7762631?dopt=Citation)).  Also, these two pathways are respond differently to vaso-active compounds (insulin, epinephrine, etc).

So now we have a framework for identifying more in depth the mechanisms for other observations, like reductions in MPS due to NSAIDs ([6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11832356?dopt=Citation)) ) or discrepancies in heating/cooling studies on soreness/MPS ([7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21680875?dopt=Citation)), as well as obesity/sarcopenia/insulin resistance ([8](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731493?dopt=Citation)).

This also may also help explain other observations for anecdotal evidence on weight loss, muscle gain, and target body fat %.  For instance Lyle McDonalds ([9](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/muscle-gain/general-philosophies-of-muscle-mass-gain.html)) comments on ideal body fat % to gain muscle at due to insulin resistance.  This may be explained by insulin resistance more likely causing impairments in modulating blood flow to the myocytes, thus making it more difficult to gain muscle mass ([10](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883642?dopt=Citation)).

There is a lot of focus on r/fitness and advfitness on the CNS and muslce protein synthesis and I just wanted to start a discussion on the roll of vasculature, so that we can start adding nitrates to our list of supplements ([11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22322971)).

Each part should be on it's own line.  Everything there is pretty self-explanatory.  For the brief abstract, it's basically just a quick overview.  The replies and discussions to those top-level posts are free form, just keep the discussion respectful (no flame wars).

We'll be moderating this thread to make sure those top posts are of this format.  Trust me, it'll be very nice when there are a lot of resources in here and you have a standard post format.

* Greater Flexibility required.

* Less compressive forces on the knee.

* Harder to cheat by shooting hips backwards during upward motion as you will drop the bar

* Easier to self teach because if your form is wrong as per above you will drop the bar

* It works the quadriceps, rectus abdominis, and erector spinae better than the back squat

As per the study below.

&gt;The front squat was shown to be just as effective as the back squat in terms of overall muscle recruitment, with signiﬁcantly less compressive forces on the knee.

1311675561.0,31,self.AdvancedFitness,j01iw,Member Spotlight - eric_twinge,34,3,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/j01iw/member_spotlight_eric_twinge/,"**Care to share some pics? Current, and any ‘before’ photos?** 

Here's a picture from about [a month ago](\(http://i.imgur.com/d4fkb.jpg\)). This is just after a workout and I'm flexing my quad @ 6'0'', ~185lbs. I don't have any good 'before' pictures to compare. 

**Age?** 31.333 **Sex?** I'm easy. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

I lift weights. I'm trying to be a runner as well. I 'compete' only on a rec level. During the summer I play in an Ultimate Frisbee league and I play indoor soccer during the winter. I'm also really into yard games and other 'leisure' sports. They are my bread and butter. 

**What’s your story?** 

This is going to be boring, I didn't have any come to Jesus moment or anything. I played all the little league type stuff as a kid but was never really that good. I was planning to continue my trek through mediocrity by playing high school football until I overhead Brice Cooper mention this new stuff called creatine the summer before my freshman year started. He was going to get ripped and tear shit up on the field using it. This freaked me out and I decided I didn't need to get mixed up with that. [4realz] 

Somewhere around 16 I decided I needed to tone up and get abs so I started using the HS weight room after school. When I think about the 'deadlifts' I did back then… ugh. I've been in and out of the weight room ever since. When I got to college I played a lot of intramurals my freshman year and I met a guy who was playing lacrosse for the school's club team. They just needed bodies so it didn't matter that I'd never even held a stick. Reluctantly I went to the first practice and was hooked. I played all four years and loved it. I managed to become a starting midfielder and face-off specialist. But, that's not saying much when you play for Iowa State. :P 

After college I've mainly just stuck to lifting weights and inconsistent running with a peppering of casual sports. My inconsistency and lack of sound programming had me forever doomed to decent but, in hindsight, lackluster results. 

A couple years ago, I discovered r/fitness. It was my first venture into a fitness forum and pretty much changed everything. I don't have a chosen sport or a fitness 'plan'. I'm just training for life. I want to be the best me I can be, and I want to enjoy the journey. (That seems so lame when it's typed out.)

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

September of last year I was a pretty lean 165lbs. But looking in the mirror I knew I needed to add some muscle. Learning to eat more was, and still is, a trial, but in February of this year I gave Starting Strength a go and discovered the Svunt Shake. Finally everything clicked into place. From Feb-May I gained 15lbs pounds while staying on the same belt notch. As a lifelong 'hardgainer', this is my proudest achievement. I'm thinking I'd like to get into the mid 190s, and I think this winter is when that is going to go down. Current lifting maximums with future goals: 

* Squat - 240x5x5. This was at the beginning of the summer, before I started running. I've never tested a 1RM for squats. I'd like to get 315 eventually. 

* Deadlift - 315x1, just did this last week. I'd like to get that to 315x5 in the short term. Hopefully getting that fourth plate on later. 

* Bench - 225x1 a couple weeks ago. I think I could go higher, but haven't. I'm pretty happy with my bench. Maybe get to 225 for worksets. 

* OHP - 135x1 also at the beginning of the summer. I just want this to go up. BWx1 at least. 

* Unofficially I've run a 59 minute 10K. I'd like to get that under 50. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I started a 10K training program through RunKeeper in May. My plan was to continue the Starting Strength routine concurrently, but it was just too much squats to pair with running. Looking around I settled on Westside for Skinny Bastards. I don't feel like I'm using it to it's full potential, but I'm still figuring it out as well. So I'm on WS4SB M/W/F and running T/R/S/S. 
My plan is to stick with this into the fall. 

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I fucking love my diet. As hippie eco-nuts, my wife and I are pretty conscious about where our food comes from and the impact it has. Nearly all our meat comes from in-state, family owned and operated farms through the local co-op. We try to get seasonal produce locally as well, either through the food co-op, farmers markets, or our meager garden. My wife gets two dozen eggs each week from a lady she works with that raises hens at her house. $1 per dozen. :D Here's [a picture of the pork chops I'll be eating this fall](http://i.imgur.com/R2emt.jpg\). My wife is a fantastic cook and I eat like a king. Even though I hate the label, I'd say about 80% of my diet is 'paleo'. Whole foods, plenty of fruit, meat, veggies, and dishes cooked from scratch just seems like a no-brainer to me. The other 20% of my diet is impulse and convenience foods. I don't shy away from any snack, junk, or fast food because let's face it: it's easy, it's delicious, and any respectable cave man would gorge on that shit. I don't know my macro breakdown but I aim for 3000-3500 calories per day, depending on activity levels. I try to avoid supplements if I can. Currently, my only supplements are whey concentrate powder, a multivitamin, fish oil, and psyllium husk. I drink a lot of tea, but I would drink it regardless of the benefits so I don't consider it a supplement. herman and silver are doing their damned best to convince me I need a whole suite of other 'vitamin-like compounds'. I figure it's only a matter of time before I break. 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

I'm in this for the long haul. I want my body to be a well oiled machine that can be called upon at a moment's notice and I want that to be true well into my later years. The trick, I think, is finding the right balance between the drive to push one's limits, with the patience and wisdom to realize that this is the tortoise's race to win. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

My brother once asked me why I do this. I couldn't give him an answer. I feel like it's an ""if you have to ask, you can't know"" sort of deal. This is just something I do. Why does a painter paint? 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

My wife is the only 'naysayer' I have in my life. And sadly, she's almost always right. She's the voice of reason when I start getting grand ideas on obtaining ultimate fitness. But I really don't have any lifestyle clashes with my fitness. Being a DINK makes for a pretty flexible schedule so I don't have any timing restrictions. I would venture to say that most people have no idea that I do go to the gym and such. When most people find out I lift weights the most common response is ""really?!?"". It's as motivating as it is deflating. 

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

All my advice comes from reddit, sadly. I've been around long enough to know who's advice I'll take very seriously. Beyond that I rely on my inner bullshit detector, which I have a lot of confidence in. I try to keep a reasonably open mind, but most people's advice in r/fitness falls apart under the weight of one word - why? 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

1. Calories in vs. calories out is all 90% of people need to know for weight loss and gain, period. I'm also pretty sure a calorie is a calorie. 
2. DOMS makes me stronger and faster. I feel like the DOMS-afflicted muscles contract from a stretched position with greater force allowing me to put up more weight or to run faster with no extra conscious effort. This could also just be in my head. But Abes agrees with me so I must be true. I also like the addition of his idea that DOMS provides greater proprioception. Sold. 

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?** 

I know others do it, but I don't think it's that common. After the worksets on all the main power lifts, I always perform a last set at a much lighter weight. I use this set to get a little extra volume but mainly to focus on form when my muscles are fatigued. I have the idea that by ending with good form in a weakened state, I'll reinforce the proper motions and hopefully form a more innate muscle memory. This could have gone in the previous section because I have no idea how well this theory pans out. 

**What injuries have you dealt with?** 

I've been very fortunate in that I've had really no major injuries to speak of. I am, however, dealing with persistent shin splints which have really derailed my running plans for this summer. They are pretty infuriating. 

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

Even though it's like panning for gold dust, if you can handle it r/fitness will turn up a nugget every now and then. FCJ tides me over in between finds. I follow a lot of blogs but nothing anyone here hasn't heard of. I like [Brad Pilon's blog](http://bradpilon.com/brads-blog/) even though it's not that technical. I like his down to earth, less is more take on fitness - it's refreshing. edubation turned me on to [LIFT-RUN-BANG](http://www.lift-run-bang.com/) recently and I've been enjoying that. I also really like the idea of MoveNat, but not it's price tag. 

**Anything else you want to add?** 

I've said it before, but you guys and gals are my gym buddies. I've achieved more and learned so much in the last two years because of you guys, and I'm truly thankful for it. I feel like this is a pretty boring spotlight. I'm sorry I don't have something you can learn from, but I'm happy to be given the honor.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_j01iw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/j01iw/member_spotlight_eric_twinge/,

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

My sport is running. I race events from the 800m on the track, up to the marathon (26.2 miles) on the road. I don't really no how to judge the level I compete at, but if I had to label it, it would be ""national class"".

**What's your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

I actually grew up playing baseball, but in high school, my best friend joined the cross country team and got me to join. That's when I started running (I was 14 years old). I liked it 'ok', but I was just average (and a bit overweight). I really didn't really start to love it until after I graduated high school. I went to University (I'm now in my junior year), and really started running more and have just kept improving to get where I'm at now.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

Well, starting with recent successes... at the start of this year, I ran my first marathon in 2 hours 38 minutes and 50 something seconds (thats about 6:04min/mile for 26 miles), easily qualifying me for the Boston Marathon my first time. I've also just recently placed 75th overall at the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta, out of 60,000 people... As for goals, my only current short term goal is a new PR for my fall marathon (Twin Cities in October) - I'd like to run low 2:30's, ideally breaking the 2:30 barrier if I can. 

My main long term goal is to qualify to run in the U.S. Olympic Trials marathon in 2015, to qualify I'd have to run 2:20:00 for the Marathon (which is a 5:19 min/mile). I'd also like to run around 14:30 for the 5k in the future.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

My workout/training regiment is detailed in a simple way. Simply, I run between 80-100 miles per week (about 12-14 a day on average), all seven days a week, twice a day. I have two running workouts per week, one being a long run/workout on Sundays that is usually between 17-22 miles long and then another shorter workout on Wed or Thurs which is usually like a track workout, tempo run, etc. I also have a core/ab workout I do every other day.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

My diet is relatively a healthy one, though I have to eat between 3,500 calories a day on average to keep healthy. I eat normal healthy food like whole-grain wheat products, grilled chicken (though I will splurge and eat red meat on occasion), and milk (I drink a ton of skim milk, I love it). I do drink Endurox R4 everyday after my longer run of the day and I also drink coconut water for hydration purposes (I gave up Powerade and Gatorade because of all the sugar. I don't drink soft drinks or eat things with too much sugar or fat. The only supplement I take is just a normal, everyday, multi-vitamin.


**What have you achieved so far? What are your 'numbers' (times, weights, heights, etc.)?**

I am 6'1, 150 pounds and about 6% body fat. My personal bests are: 

 * Mile- 4:17, 
 * 5k -15:28 
 * 10k - 32:10 
 * Half Marathon - 1:13:44 (unofficially) 
 * Marathon - 2:38:5X. .... 
 * and Bench Press - 165 lbs, lol.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

I don't really have a philosophy, I just know what my goals are and do everything I can to achieve them. I guess if I had to go with a philosophy, I'd have to go with the cliche quote by Steve Prefontaine, ""To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift.""

**What challenges do you face?** 

Well, other than the obvious physical barriers, I'd have to say my school. I will be in grad school in a year and have to find a way to train the way I need while balancing work and school. Also, money is an obstacle, while running itself is pretty cheap, traveling to races is not.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I keep thinking and visioning myself running certain times or in certain races. When I wake up to get my first run in and I don't feel like getting out to run, I say to myself, ""In 2 months, 2 years or even a decade from now, when I look back at my training and ask myself, 'did I do everything I possibly could to achieve my goals and be the best I was capable of?'.. I want to be able to say I did.""... As cliche and cheesy as that sounds, it works for me.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

I ignore them. I'm sure you can believe when I tell people I want to compete in the Olympic trials among the best Americans that I get people who laugh at me. Thats just fuel for the fire. I want to prove them wrong (just like I have so far with my current PR's)... I am lucky enough to have very supportive friends and family, many of whom are also runners. My best friend is actually a division-1 collegiate Cross Country and Track runner.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

That's really on a case to case basis. I mean, I consider any advice from reputable sources, coaches, other runners, etc. However, when a fitness buff who thinks they know about running tells me something, (for example: Barefoot/minimalist running is best for you -- I hear this all the time), I just nod my head and ignore them.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Oh, there are so many. For one, there are study's that show chocolate milk is just as good as a post recovery drink as something like Endurox R4. That is simply not true; I don't care what the paper says. I know I recover far better with Endurox than I do with chocolate milk... Also, back to the barefoot running debate, I know that barefoot running is not all its cracked up to be. You will never get me to train in Vibram five fingers, NEVER.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I can't think of anything specifically. My routines and diet are pretty much a mixture of everything I've ever read, been taught, or learned from experience through the past 6 years of running. I've just found what works for me.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

I've been lucky enough to have not had any major running related injuries (knock on wood). But training the way I do, I do live with a constant muscle soreness (a good kind of soreness) in my legs. I have rolled my ankle many times and have had some mild cases of Achilles Tendonitis, but never anything that has kept me from running for more than a week... On a side note, a friend of mine had a Femoral Stress fracture and couldnt run for almost 8 months.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

The best advice I can give to prevent injuries are too warm-up, stretch and cool down properly, after every single workout/run. There are drills I do that prevent shin splints and Achilles Tendonitis (Eccentric Calf Raises). Also, core and hip strengthening exercises are very important. It would surprise most people how lower leg injuries (knee to ankle) are actually caused by a misaligned hip.... If you are to get injured, ice and rest is key. Don't try to run/workout until you are completely healed!

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** - Sports: Running, of course, but I'm also a big Baseball and Tennis fan. Fitness books: Daniels Running Formula, 2nd edition and Lore of Running. DVD's: I like 'Running Reckless' with Anthony Famiglietti and also 'Fire on the Track' about Steve Prefontaine. Websites: Letsrun.com (some usefull info if you can get past the trolls on the forums), Runningtimes.com, USATF.org, Runnersspace.com, and Marathonguide.com

Sit-ups? I dropped them after reading from multiple sources that the back flexion involved in sit-ups puts more stress on the intervertebral discs than the exercise is worth.

The goal of this feature is to bring together /r/AdvancedFitness to discuss these issues that you have considered but don’t have or understand sufficient evidence to be confident about them.

This is also not to attack the relative merits and deficiencies of a single source. We aren’t a journal club.

Relevant articles:

http://peakcentre.wordpress.com/category/rowing/

So my question is, how would you go about training your respiratory muscles (diaphragm and whatnot) without using relatively expensive specialized equipment?

Those articles dont seem to indicate that simply breathing heavily for sessions would really train the respiratory muscles, if so then you would expect to train them simply by doing intense workouts. The key seems to be increasing the resistance of air flow into your lungs, could this be simulated by something like a session of breathing through a straw? 

I'd like to add this kind of training into my routine, but I'm not sure how to do it effectively without spending much money. Any ideas on how to do this would be great, thanks!

What happens when you do two Smolov Jr. cycles right after another?  

*****

Program [here](http://wkak.net/SmolovFAQ.htm).

*****

**Same deal again:**

1. No pressing other than bench.
2. Pre-hab with Cuban Presses and miscellaneous resistance band work. 
3. Lots of fish oil.
4. 5/3/1 for squats and deadlifts.
5. Some workouts were fasted.
6. Lots of weighted pull-up work (including stuff on rings). 


*****

**What I found:**

1. I only had one positive failure... the last set in the third workout of my second week (sets of 5). 
2. Noticeable chest size increases. 
3. Right shoulder feels a little off... but it didn't happen until yesterday (3 days after Smolov ended). 
4. Really damn fun.
5. Hit a big PR in deadlifts (475lbs) while on the program. 
6. Gained weight - from 200lbs/90.7kg to 204lbs/92.5kg. Eating about 4k Calories a day. 

*****

**Results:**

Keep in mind how stubborn my bench has been (check the previous threads) with my wide wingspan (6'6""/198cm).

First Cycle: 210lbs/95kg to 230lbs/104kg

This Cycle:  **230lbs/104kg** to **250lbs/113kg**. 

Yeah, that's right, another 20lbs onto my bench in three weeks. That brings my bench up 19% in about 7 weeks for someone who has struggled with his bench since starting to lift in October 2009.

Ugh. [NSFW for the bathing suit](http://i.imgur.com/t1026.jpg), and [my last marathon](http://i.imgur.com/B1emf.jpg) for good measure. 

**Age?** 23 years old, 5' 8"" 145 lbs. **Sex?** Yes please. 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

I am a long distance runner, recently thrown myself into some cycling, love to swim, love to lift, ski ([I live in CO](http://i.imgur.com/NAQ5D.jpg)!), and hike.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

I’ve always been a big girl, maybe never obese, but certainly strong and built. Unfortunately, girls’ sports were lackluster at my school so I turned into a bookworm nerd and pianist. My weight fluctuated to a high of, lord knows, a pant size of 16, down after healthy eating to size 11 pant and 170 pounds or so, stayed at that until college.
At that time I did some small runs, but I dealt with chronic knee pain for almost a year. Saw a physical therapist, nothing helped. Suddenly my roommate starts to train for a marathon and I am instantly interested. She hands me a schedule and we train over the summer.
Then the knight in shining armor comes. Some weird hippy who regularly buys salmon from me at a natural grocer. He hands me a bootleg DVD of “Chi Running,” a form video taught by an ultrarunner hippy, and after going through the video and form exercises everything falls into place. Since then not a single. stiff. joint. Huttah.
Forgive me though, because that never made me a good runner. My first marathon was finished at a whopping 5:35ish (I think the real time is suppressed in my memory) and at [185 or so pounds](http://i.imgur.com/s8F8v.jpg).

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

My last marathon was a 4:02. I found two ladies running a good pace and kept them in sight, by the time I had hit 13 miles I clocked in at 1:51, and although pumped I was immediately concerned that I was running too fast. The sun went away and I lost a lot of body heat, and when I met my boyfriend at 20 miles to pace with me, I had slowed significantly and announced “I think my legs will fail soon.” Around mile 23, a long slight incline halted me in my tracks, my legs started to wobble a bit and I wasn’t walking too well. In all my femaleness, emotions started to overwhelm me, and my spirit began to break. Right then and there I stopped, took a big breath, hands over my head, closed my eyes and told myself everything was ok, people have crawled before. And then, step by step, by sweet jeebus my legs were working again, and by mile 25 I was on a full on fast pace to the finish. When I finished, a lady stopped me to take the chip off my shoe. I started to asphyxiate from brevity of the stop and the elation of my finish time. I stopped breathing and simultaneously started to cry, and in a moment of confusion actually kicked the poor lady off my foot, sat down on the ground, and just huddled in emotional happiness. It was far from a great time, but an hour and a half better than my first marathon.

My goals for the summer: One more marathon in October, would love a 3:45-3:50, also really wanted to run a 30 mile but I might do that after the marathon, and to complete a century on Aug 20 in Dillon, CO. I really didn't give myself enough time for the [century](http://www.circlethesummit.com/rideinfo.html) and I'm pretty nervous about it because of the climb (5500ft). We'll see.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

My running schedule was a bit wild this summer. I only gave myself 12 weeks for training and made it very simple: three long runs a week, Tu Thr and Saturday. My very first week started at 8/10/14mi and my last week was something like 14/16/23mi. All runs progressed in mileage every week if everything went well, no rest weeks, and upper body lifting M W Fri. On rare occasions I would do a crazy run to the gym and squat session on Sundays after the long run, but my legs would be irreparably sore so I opted for some easy mountain hiking most of the time.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet looks like a retarded amount of vegetables (10-15 servings a day), 3 eggs for breakfast, meat, and whey protein daily. While on marathon schedule I eat low carb Sun-Tues and up carbs throughout the week until the end of Saturday night. Upped carbs include a zillion bananas, lentils, black beans, or hummus, oatmeal, stove popped popcorn, and some grains. Usually very little wheat, and not a lot of sugar or processed foods.

Calories range from 1300-1500 on non-running days, up to 2200-2800 (counting what is eaten on the run) or so toward the end of the week. My weekday long runs were a serious digestive issue for a while, I would have to stop no later than 11am to make sure I’d be cleaned out by the time I got home for work. The only thing I really count is protein, at least 100-120g a day, and calories on actual runs, which at this point has been 250-300 calories an hour, eaten mostly in fruit, peanut butter, fig newtons, coconut juice, or clif bars. No carb gels. That stuff makes me nauseous. I am nuts about electrolytes since I am a heavy, salty sweater, and have been crazy about putting a lot of lemon and salt in my drinks on runs. Does wonders.

Endurance running is an highly introverted sport, while bodybuilding is extremely extroverted (literally the comparison of one body to another). Most endurance runners enjoy learning about their body’s natural limits, so it can be difficult to understand why I would take supplementation instead of making a lifestyle change.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

My PRs for weights are as follows (I've only been lifting since November): Bench Press – 105 pounds Squat – 185 pounds Overhead Press – 75 pounds as of last week!

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

There is no blueprint for life. No elite time, no final pace. I don’t see progress in a linear way, and I don’t necessarily look to the top for clues as to how I want to live my life. I see opportunities and I take them, and am sort of addicted to failure. As someone interested in linguistics, I get frustrated by the way we limit our competitions just to make arbitrary labels, records, and trophies.

I know that sounds flowery, but in our modern times “fitness” has taken over exercise, “cardio” for running, biking, or rowing, and “strength training” as the mother of all else. Suddenly we’ve whittled our world down so we can acquire certain results, what we perceive to be the same results, and have lowered chances of failure. Yawn.

**What challenges do you face?** 

Many, many challenges. For probably two years I have been dealing with a lot of vomiting, crashing after runs, and other failures of the body. This is really the first year I can go running and easily spend the rest of the day doing whatever else, unaffected.

I am absolutely undecided about my bodyweight, which is pretty high for a distance runner. I will lose my period at a lower bodyweight (when I was 135 I didn't have it for almost a year), and I begin to run into a cycle where muscles will strain from too little calories and I start to risk injuries.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

Spontaneity and adventure are big ones. If I find myself getting bored with one thing, I learn how to spruce it up. Recently I’ve been driving to different areas of Denver for long runs, downloading and listening to audiobooks while running, or listening to new albums.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

Clashes are few and far between. I treat running like a hobby, I make time for it and I make time for other things as well. It isn't too hard to plan when you've got a schedule.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I ignore anything that sounds like an advertisement. I take advice pretty slowly and prefer to let myself learn the hard way, even though it has meant a lot of wrong roads.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Oh boy. I am not a genius on any of this. The only one I got is a frustration with distance running schedules because of the myth of “the wall” being at mile 20. There are many walls, and I think making run schedules to 20 miles tops for a marathon doesn’t help. My last “wall” occurred exactly at the furthest distance I had run only two weeks before…

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Definitely the mileage training. My running schedule was purely an invention of my own and created to give me confidence and experience with running the actual distance, rather than just praying that I'd make it. I would NOT recommend it to anyone who hasn't run a few marathons first.

I never stretch, ever. I hate stretching, unless it is yoga... which I have only committed to one summer. When I am in full running schedule, I am naturally pretty flexible.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

No injuries. I haven’t had a single problem with running in three years! So help me god.

Most common injuries are shin splints, knee pains, hip pains, ankle pains, everything pains.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Well, for the aforementioned runner, simply run on a yellow line, one foot to each line. If it feels really weird, you’re most likely doing something wrong.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

I love you guys. Never take me too seriously, I’m a goofball and am most likely not doing something optimally.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_j6jvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/j6jvw/member_spotlight_mrbukowski/,

**The Four Methods Used:**

* Dynamic Method - Accelerating 50-60pct of a max as quickly as possible to achieve a greater amount of force (F=MA)


* Max Effort Method - Using 90pct or more of a max

* Conjugate Method - Used with Max Effort Method, switches up the lift used during Max Effort every 1-2 weeks to prevent CNS fatigue. Beginners are recommended to switch every 3 weeks.

* Repetition Method - 6-15 reps used for hypertrophy (the true repetition method is repetition until failure of a lighter weight in order to prevent injuries)

**Here's the basic set-up:**

I used this system for around a month (MTTF set-up) to break through some plateaus i had after dropping 10lbs. 


**Questions:**

* Does anyone have any past experiences or opinions on the Westside Barbell template?

* At what point should a lifter begin using this system? (Louie Simmons says that even beginners can utilize Westside Barbell)

* Also, do you think that I could make greater progress on my Squat and DL using a simpler program?

My Current Stats:

Bench - 245

Squat - 295

DL - 295

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I'm a former competitive powerlifter who still plays with somewhat heavy weights, but after a non-training related injury I scaled back on the weights and moved to a more all around performance focus. Since I'm very competitive by nature I had to find other things to do after powerlifting so I went the complete opposite direction and decided to do a marathon. From there I met up with some amazing triathletes who talked me into adventure racing and I have recently taken up Kung-Fu.

* **What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

After college and starting a career I realized I needed something to do other than work or I was going to end up that guy who repeatedly tells the same High School football stories while everyone listening assumes he was the water boy. Having a job with long hours meant team sports were out so I decided to make use of the fitness center in my apartment complex since I had 24 hour access. I started going 3 days a week before work and within a few months I outgrew all the machines and started pricing out gym memberships. I was shocked to find that the gyms in my area didn't open until 5AM and I was usually spent after work so I decided to build a home gym. 

Shortly after I got everything setup I decided I needed a goal other than ""be in shape"" and started talking to people about lifting weights. Most of the guys I talked to were bodybuilders or wannabe bodybuilders and honestly I enjoy food too much to stress out the way they do about their diet so I kept looking for a niche I though I fit in. Back before the internet was loaded down with site after site devoted to strength training there was a little corner on Usenet called alt.sport.weightlifting I spent a lot of time downloading threads about getting stronger and eventually ran across some threads about powerlifting. I had finally found a way to take lifting heavy things in the gym from a hobby to a sport. I posted like crazy, tried a half dozen training methods and talked about potential meet numbers all while training alone in my apartment and never having actually seen a meet. 

Then someone posted about a meet that was being held about an hour from where I lived and I decided to check it out. Keep in mind here that I hadn't ever seen the lifts performed in real life according to meet rules and hadn't even so much as met another powerlifter so I went in expecting to see these massive guys just throwing weights around. Long story short the meet was nothing like I expected, lifters ranged from skinny teenaged girls to massive guys who looked one heartbeat away from a coronary. After watching a meet for the first time I decided I had to give it a try so I grabbed a flyer for the next meet on my way out the door and decided to get serious about this powerlifting thing. As soon as I got home I started mapping out my workouts for the next three months. 

Meet day came and I was a wreck, I was going in almost blind since I'd never had anyone actually watch me lift. On top of that, even though I trained in my ""one-piece lifting suit"" commonly known as a wrestling singlet for three weeks leading up to the meet I was dreading people actually seeing me in it. Not knowing how things worked, I weighed in the morning of the meet and chatted with the meet director a little during the weigh in. He recognized my name from the newsgroup and wished me luck. Next I had to go and get my rack height for the monolift recorded. There were a couple guys running the lift who asked me way more questions than I had answers for so we settled on a height and width with the understanding that I was going to walk the weights out since that's how I had been training. I was lifting in the 242 novice division after weighing in at 227, the weight class put me in the first session, second flight. There were 4 others in my class and I was the only one not wearing a squat suit or knee wraps, out of place didn't even begin to describe how I felt. I started to think that I might have screwed up my attempts because I had the biggest opening squat in my class with 396 so when I finally got on the platform I was terrified that I was going to get buried and then bomb out of the meet. 

I got the signal and everything just became automatic, I popped the bar up and dropped, before I knew it I was back in the rack and looking at three white lights, everything went so fast I forgot to walk the weight out like I had planned. As I was turning to leave the platform the back spotter grabbed me and said ""dude, not so deep next time"" and then pointed me over to the head judge. When I got there she was laughing and motioned for me to squat down beside her as the next lifter got ready. Then she looked over and said ""two things, first calm down this is supposed to be fun and second go buy a squat suit, you're going to be pretty good at this"". After that the butterflies were gone and I started to understand why people did this. I finished out going 462, 407, 551 and took second in the class by less than 10 pounds with lots of weight left on the platform. 

After the meet the director came up to me and asked where I was lifting, then he told me he was looking to add another training partner and that I should stop by sometime to train with him and his group. That was the start of many friendships that are still going strong today even though the group of guys have scattered.

The start of my endurance sport training didn't have such a feel good story. A year before my last meet I ruptured two disks in a snowboarding wreck. I used powerlifting and the injury as an excuse to avoid anything that even looked like cardio and moved my way from a light 242 to a full 275 weighing in at 273 for my second to last meet. I had a good meet but spent the next two days laying on the living room floor because my back was so bad it hurt to even roll over. Then the turning point hit, my wife walked in, sat on the couch and said ""aren't you tired of always being hurt?"", which started the always popular ""I'm not always hurt"" defense complete with examples of whole weeks where I was up walking around in an almost normal manner. She was right I seemed to be having more bad days than good days as far as my back was concerned but I was too hard headed to stop lifting because the weights were still going up. Eventually the talk turned to my physical size. When I met my wife I weighed 170 pounds, was very lean and very active, now I was 100 pounds heavier and spent most of my free time laying down to rest my back. Something had to give so I decided it would be my body weight, I figured even if I lost some pounds from my lifts that I'd be able to hold on to enough strength to be competitive. 

I started walking and increased my sled work, then started jogging on rest days eventually stretching my runs out to the five mile range while keeping at the powerlifting as usual. What happened took me and my training partners by surprise as I got lighter my lifts didn't drop, they kept going up. I had been convinced that to lift bigger that I had to be bigger but things weren't working out that way. In 2003 I did my last powerlifting meet and finished with my biggest total then I ran a 5K the next weekend. 

In 2004 the company I was working for folded and I moved out of state, leaving me without a steady group of guys to train with. I kept telling myself that I'd get settled and then find guys to train with and keep competing but my workouts started turning more toward endurance and my strength training took a back seat. 5Ks gave way to 10Ks and those gave way to Marathons, then Ultra Marathons. I found some running friends and then they turned me on to adventure racing. Most recently I caved to my brother's constant badgering to come and see what Kung-Fu is all about, turns out it comes pretty naturally to me so that has become my primary conditioning work as I put a little more focus back into the strength side as I'm thinking about getting back on the platform.

* **What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I'm currently trying to put together programming that will let me get back to being competitive at least at the local level on the powerlifting side while keeping my back in one piece and keeping the athleticism up through martial arts. I've got several people trying to talk me into tournament fighting but I'm not so sure that's going to happen.

* **What is your workout or training regimen?** 

Four days a week I'm doing strength work, MTWF split into two bench days and two squat/dl days and on Wednesday nights and Saturdays I'm working Kung-Fu into the mix. There is also odd conditioning work when I feel like throwing it in.

My strength work could best be described as a hybrid of Stephan Korte's 3x3 and Westside barbells conjugate method. In the past I had great success doing Korte's 3x3 on my own and then Westside with the group I trained with so I've taken what I liked of each one and I'm using them together.

Kung-Fu is laid out so that about half the class is combat related hitting targets, bags or grappling and the other half is spent working on forms. My odd conditioning comes in the form of just going out to the garage or the yard to goof around when I'm bored. It's not what you would call serious or even planned for that matter but I do think it's worth mentioning. Typically I'm doing handstands or handstand pushups, throwing a keg around, doing one arm snatches, odd grip pull ups or whatever sounds like fun that day. The basic idea is to just have fun and get a little skill work in. 

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

This is where everyone is going to cringe, I eat pretty much what I want, when I want. I don't eat a lot of junk but I don't actively avoid it either. As I'm typing I'm eating lunch which today happens to be pork loin stuffed with spinach, sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella that was left over from last night's dinner. My wife can cook and I love to eat so my diet has never been very strict. I've tried IF but my schedule makes it tough.

Supplements are about as simple as they get, fish oil and BCAAs twice a day, once after my morning workout with a whey protein shake and then again about an hour before bed time with water. So I guess the question here would be why those two? Simply put the anti-inflamatory properties of both and the increased protein synthesis of the BCAAs, in short to aid recovery from all the stupid things I do to myself.

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

At my last powerlifting meet nearly 8 years I go finished out the meet at squat 805, bench 600 and deadlift 755. 

My best 5K time is 16:38, and I've got 5 really slow marathons and 4 even slower ultra marathons ranging from 30 miles to 100 miles under my belt.

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Things are much simpler than they appear, stop making them complicated.

* **What challenges do you face?** 

Well, there's the back issue which makes lifting heavy a delicate balancing act, then there's family life which means my strength training is done before anyone else in the house is awake. I've also recently learned that I have either a gluten intolerance or allergy but don't know which because a full little condition known as dermographia. The skin issue made squat suits a joy which meant that I didn't tend to wear them as tight as other lifters because if I did I couldn't stand to wear it for more than a couple minutes max.

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

I don't. I get out of bed at 4:30AM because I know that if I don't then I'll be regretting it at 8AM since there wasn't really a good reason to stay in bed. Regarding why I train the way I do or why I participate in the events that I do it's simply because I want to. I enjoy being able to say ""that sounds fun"" and then being able to go out and do it.

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't deal with too many naysayers, it's usually the opposite, people tend to assume I can do things because my personality doesn't make quitting easy. Clashes though, those come often but it's not just based on the fitness side of my lifestyle, in short I'd rather be home playing with my kids or having dinner with my wife than out at a bar or hanging out with a bunch of guys so I politely decline their offers and enjoy my life the way I like to live it. 

My wife and I haven't had many clashes and honestly if one happens it's usually about my latest weird injury and it ends with her making it clear that when I hurt myself she's not the one to whine to. My kids fully embrace my insanity, they come play with me in the gym when I'm goofing off and when we go to parks they're the ones cheering me on as do stupid things. Co-workers come and go, but typically they're asking me how to get into shape or asking me to tell them about my latest adventure not making negative comments.

* **What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I openly accept technique/form advice, since you can't see yourself perform live you have to rely on others to give you feedback. Even with video taping and watching later there will be little things that you can see in real time that you might miss because of a camera angle or perspective.

I ignore just about anything that sounds like someone is quoting a scientific journal. Sorry the journal might be right but if you can't break it down to common language then you don't understand it enough to be teaching me about it. I'm not impressed by people who memorize blocks of text but have no idea how it applies to the real world.

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

This first one I think of as being common sense, but I've had people argue this with me and I've never seen a study. ""If you eat a pound of butter you will not gain more than a pound of body weight"" I hear people say things like they are going to gain five pounds from eating a bag of M&amp;Ms but I'm convinced that you can't gain more than what those M&amp;Ms actually weigh no matter what the calorie count is.

Secondly I believe that there is a portion of your brain that limits muscular output, both limit strength and reserve energy. I think re-training this part of the brain is a large portion of what are typically called beginners gains. I believe that it is a defense mechanism against muscular and skeletal damage and I believe that over time and training it allows for increased output but only to the extent that it is pushed. I think you see a lot of ""naturally"" strong people not because of genetics but because of experience and their brain allowing them use more of the capacity on hand. I think this is also a large portion of ""old man strength"".

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I am totally unique just like everyone else... I probably do a ton of little things that most gym goers wouldn't think of but because I've been doing them for so long they are like second nature so I don't notice them. I'll just list some little things to make your workouts go smoother.

If you're loading a bar on the floor once you get to 225 (two 45s per side) grab a 5lbs plate and place it under the inside edge of the first 45, then roll the 45 up onto the little plate. This gives you enough room to easily side the big plates on and off without holding the bar up with one hand and working the plate with the other.

As soon as you finish a set if you need to adjust the weight do it right away, no waiting around, then take your break. I've seen a lot of people load the bar at the end of their rest period and I think this defeats the purpose of taking the rest.

Breathe, seriously, take a breath between reps, you'll be surprised how many people hold their breath through a full set or the majority of a set, when they learn to breathe they'll be shocked at how much more weight they can move.

Always squeeze the bar, bench, squat, deads, whatever, squeeze the bar and tighten your forearms the added stability might surprise you.

Use your heart rate to judge rest breaks not the clock. If your heart is racing and you're not working on conditioning then take a few more deep breaths and let your body get back to normal. The clock should not dictate your rest time.

Pull up bars are everywhere just be careful with tree limbs as some aren't quite as strong as they look.

Before any heavy single you should have already done the lift 3 times in your head. Beat the weight in your mind before you get under the bar and half the battle is already won.

Don't get sucked into the lift of the month fever, I'm not naming names but I think it started with Arnold and it's still going. Let's just say I know people who tweaked a lift and gave it a new name just for the name association. Why? It gets their name in people's heads and helps sell their wares, others did it to make a point about the first group of people but sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

Horse liniments are typically less expensive and more effective than those marketed for humans, just saying and I won't get into bovine products available at your local farm store.

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Two ruptured disks in my back, dislocation of both ankles multiple times (luckily never both at the same time) and I've broke nearly every finger on both hands, some twice, none of those injuries were lifting related but were the ones that affected lifting the most.

Lifting injuries have been limited to muscle pulls/tears in my left hamstring and left pec. I've also had tendonitis in my elbows for years.

Any sport has risks and the more you put yourself out there the more likely you are to get hurt. I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone competing at a high level in any sport that hasn't had some injury, the difference is that they came back and beat the injury instead of giving up.

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Know your limits and dance around the edge of them. When you do get hurt learn from it and take your down time as a period to regroup. Learn the difference between pressure, soreness and pain, recognizing a problem early can mean a minor injury and short recovery instead of being totally out of commission.

* **What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

In days gone by the old Supertraining list, the Strength list, Twisted Lifters all of which I think have died with the introduction of web based forums. 

Books Steve Justa’s Rock Iron Steel Pavel Tsatsouline's Power to the People Randall Strossen's Super Squats. All of them for the same reason, simple and plain time tested methods used to build strength.

DVDs are harder to pin down, I've seen so many from guys like Dave Tate, J.M. Blakely, Louie Simmons, etc. that I got a lot from. The one that's probably the most entertaining is Ronnie Coleman's The Unbelievable there are parts where he's moving freaky weights but you can't stop laughing because he spends his rest times hamming it up.

* **Anything else you want to add?**

If you're attempting it, chances are someone else has already tried it. Ask around it's amazing how much people like to talk about their little niche in the world if you give them an ear.

Here’s one /r/Fitness may remember – http://i.imgur.com/hDUXm.jpg

Here’s one of my favorite ones of me – http://i.imgur.com/lCJ5d.jpg

**Age?**

22, almost 23.

**Sex?**

Yes please. But seriously, male … as far as I can tell.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Powerlifting and rowing … powerlifting competitively and rowing on my own. I’ve gotten some records in different federations (USAPL and WABDL), but let’s be honest, the 56kg weight class is rather sparse.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I was quite the lazy person in high school, no sports. When I got to college, I made a bet with my boss from my summer job that I could make it to the gym at least 3 times per week. Well, after the first week or two, I was addicted, so I handily won the bet. When I came back for spring semester, my workout partners became flaky, so come spring break, I looked for club sports I could join. I stumbled upon the powerlifting club and joined as soon as I got back. I’ve been doing that ever since. 

I joined the rowing team as a coxswain for a little while, but the 4:30am wake ups weren’t my thing.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m coming off a 5-month powerlifting break (not by choice) so I’d like to get my old numbers back, and then hit a raw 480lbs deadlift (at 120), 405lbs squat, and eventually, a 240lbs bench press. Last night I tried deadlifting for the first time in 5 months and hit 385lbs with room to spare (going for 407lbs next week, feeling good about it) … I was laughing about that the entire car ride home. Feels good man.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I change up my workout programs whenever I feel like I’m stalling or plateauing so I’ve tried a lot of different programs, from Coan/Phillip, Mag/Ort, custom programs and so on. Funnily enough, I’ve never done SS or SL.

* M – Deadlift / accessory
* T – Bench Press / accessory
* W – Cardio (endurance)
* R – Cardio (sprints)
* F – Squats / accessory
* S – Cardio (endurance)
* S – Rest

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

*Diet*

I’ve gone through a bunch of different diets, but so far, I’ve had great success with my current one. I’m doing intermittent fasting with .5g/lb fat, 1-1.5g/lb protein, and the rest carbs. My energy is great and I’m able to get a lot of variety in my diet.

*Supplements*

I tend to cycle my supplements to try and get the most benefit out of them. The most common ones I use are creatine, caffeine, beta alanine, fish oils, multi-vitamin, BCAAs, and fiber.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

*Powerlifting (at 123.5lbs)*

* Deadlift: 430lbs
* Bench: 210lbs
* Squat: 360lbs

*Other*

* Multiple rowing marathons
* 60km rowing ultra-marathon
* A couple running half-marathons

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Call me a nerd, but I think Yoda said it best, “Do or do not, there is no try.” I either go to the gym and give it everything I have, or I stay home and not waste my time in the gym. I also believe experience trumps an article or ‘study’. I know I might get some flak for saying that, but experience is personal as it happens to you, whereas a study or fitness article involves other people. I’m not saying I don’t read training articles or read up on studies, but if I had to choose between the two, I’d side more toward personal experience.

**What challenges do you face?**

There’s the whole ‘being short” thing, which I guess I don’t mind too much, it’s just annoying when people make assumptions about you based on height (something you can’t change, unlike weight). I tend to turn it around and make it a source of motivation, to show that I can lift like the best of ‘em, surprise them with strength and make them reevaluate their assumptions not only about myself, but others as well. Other than that, there’s the heart surgery thing.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

In all honesty, through music. I listen to lots and lots of metal music, half for the sound, half for the lyrics. I’ve not found a better method to personally motivating myself. I’ve hit nearly 90% of my PRs listening to the same exact song, [Mortal Share by Insomnium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WWtUm8BeGY). At the 0:24 mark, that moment, is when I go for the lift. Some of my recommended bands to listen to for lifting – Amon Amarth, Insomnium, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Ensiferum, and Arch Enemy.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

A lot of time I’ll catch crap from friends or family about my diet, but they usually lay off of my lifting stuff. When I hear stuff from them about how I should ‘live a little’ and eat what they are, I try to evaluate the situation. If it’s a special event or something, yeah, I’ll ease up. However, a lot of times, the people telling me to ‘live a little’ are the ones that are overweight, don’t exercise, bitch and moan about how they’re not in shape, and so on, so I just ignore them and remember my goals.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I take the good and ignore the bad, duh. Ha ha, if only it were that easy. To be honest, I’m not really sure. I guess I take advice from others where I can tell the advice they’re giving me has actually worked for them, bonus points if I’ve actually seen it happen. If they just mention a study or something, I’ll look into it and see if there’s merit, instead of just being a fitness fad or something.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

*Training*

Sometimes it’s better to ignore the pain and push on (but be reasonable)
I may get crap for this, but a lot time people are just being pussies and don’t want to put in the effort when they say, “I can’t do it”. Yes, sometimes people can’t, but I feel like a lot of people haven’t pushed themselves hard enough or far enough to truly know the difference between “the wall” and their absolute limits. Rowing taught me that one all too well.

*Diet*

A balanced diet is more important than going to extremes (paleo, zone, atkins, vlcd, etc). Those can definitely work for people, but they’re not for everybody.

Pancakes make great post-workout meals.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

In powerlifting, a lot of lifters tend not to be too into the cardio thing. I wouldn’t say I enjoy it, but I find it helps a lot, especially the endurance aspect. I find that I can lift heavy longer than others because my body is used to extended periods of exertion. Anecdotal? Yes, but it’s personal experience. Also, I tend to do a fair share of body weight exercises (my favorite being handstand pushups), so I get some odd looks at the gym for those, but oh well.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I’ve been extremely lucky as I’ve never had a fitness-caused injury. However, in the summer of 2008, I had heart surgery (and have a kickass scar to prove it). Being forced out of the gym for months while my body recovered really sucked, but I was able to learn a lot about myself in that time and realized this is something I really want to do with my life.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Patience, patience, patience. Understand that you can’t just jump in right where you left off. In all honesty, I’m not really sure what else I can say aside from be patience, remember your goals, and play is smart / safe.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

Anything related to powerlifting. Some resources and media I enjoy – leangains.com, powerliftingwatch.com, “Bigger, Stronger, Faster”, “Powerlifting Unlimited”, bodybuilding.com forums.

**Anything else you want to add?**

Thanks for this opportunity and if there are any questions, I’d love to answer them.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_fm45m,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/fm45m/member_spotlight_shortkid422/,
1375200604.0,26,self.AdvancedFitness,1jct8p,A model for motor neuron recruitment,32,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1jct8p/a_model_for_motor_neuron_recruitment/,"I've been reading through the paper [Relationship Between Firing Rate and Recruitment Threshold of Motoneurons in Voluntary Isometric Contractions](http://jn.physiology.org/content/104/2/1034.full), and thought some of you might be interested too.  The paper provides some nice evidence for the ""size principle"", where the central nervous system first recruits the smallest, most easily excitable motor units for a task.  

I've translated the paper into a simple model below.

**A simplified model of muscle contraction**

Say we have 100 muscle fibers to work with.  All fibers are all of different strengths, with higher strength fibers being less metabolically efficient.

* We sort these 100 fibers the force they can generate and annotate them as m1, m2.. m100 where m100 is greatest force that the strongest fiber can produce.  Assume all mi&gt;1.0
* Each fiber has an energy efficiency, where the least strong fiber (m1) is the most metabolically efficient, while the strongest fiber (m100) is the least efficient.  A simple model of efficiency is mi^alpha, where alpha&gt;1.0.  As an example, lets say that alpha=2.0 (pulling a number from a hat).
* After contracting, each fiber must rest for a time (ri) proportional to its force generation (mi).  Thus strong fibers (big mi) must rest longer (big ri).
* Contracting each fiber takes some amount of time (t1, t2,  .. t100).   Thus, getting fiber 16 to contract will require t16 seconds of brain control.  
* Contraction time (ti) is inversely proportional to force generated (mi).  Thus the strongest fibers have the shortest ti.
* Brain can signal to only 10 fibers at a time.  Once a signal is initiated, the signal does not stop until the fiber fires. Hence slower fibers (larger ti values) will tie up the brain for longer.


**Problem:**

How should our brain dynamically signal muscle to achieve a given contraction force with a maximum efficiency?

**Answer:**

* Always prefer the fast responding fibers (small ti) first, thus often will start with only a few fibers activated (say 3).

* If that force is sustained, progressively activate more fibers that are slower (larger ti), but higher efficiency (lower mi), until the brain's capacity is hit (10).

**Effect:**

*Low force:*

* Only so many low force fibers present (say m1-m10), so the focus will be on activating only these using the full brain capacity.  It can use stronger fibers occasionally too, but this should recruit the least fibers total (low strength fibers or nothing).

*High force:* 

* Only so many high force fibers present (say m90-100), so the focus will be on activating only these using the full brain capacity.  The brain may occasionally choose lower force fibers if needed, but the bias will lead it to select an intermediate number of fibers (mostly of highest strength, but it pays a lag price).

*Intermediate force:*

* The full range of fiber forces can be used, from only intermediate force (m45-m55) or a mixture of higher and lower (m20-25 and m70-75).  This selection freedom will cause the most fibers to be recruited. 

**Implications:**

* Newbie strength gains are due to the motor cortex developing better programs for optimal fiber recruitment.  Much of this learning is essentially learning the force and firing time required for each fiber.

* After developing a pretty good motor neuron program, strength gains can come from:
	- Shifting the identity of existing fibers (as far as that is possible).
	- Finding new fibers that are already present, but the motor cortex was unaware of.
	- Growing new fibers (say [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802591))
	- Improving the motor neuron program
	- Performing the exercise in a different way.

* Performing exercises that are related, but not the same as the target movement may help the motor cortex identify related fibers and/or gather data on rarely used, but possibly useful fibers.

* Exercises at intermediate effort will tend to recruit the most fibers, and most diverse set of fibers.   In this regime, one will get stronger at a moderate rate, but will develop more endurance (no surprise).

* Exercises at high effort (high force fibers) will recruit an intermediate number of fibers, mostly high force.   In this regime, one will get stronger at a faster rate, but less endurance (no surprise).

* Exercising at low, intermediate, and high effort will activate the larges number of fibers.

**TLDR**

Don't just lift heavy or light, do both.

Those are a different beast that I don't want to question at this point in time.

My question more-so lies among the actual weight lifting workout, and whether there are any modifications to a standard weight lifting regimen that could increase fat burning.

I know the general correlation of 'more weight moved and/or more muscles activated == more calories burnt' acutely, but I was wondering what is beyond that. Primarily, does one form of weight lifting cause a greater EPOC than other forms of weight lifting?

That's the main question, but other ones I am thinking of are:

- Does anybody know whether the 'pump' in a muscle has any relation to overall metabolic rate, EPOC, or fat burning?

- The supposed increase in fat burning from GH release from short rest periods; is this clinically significant enough to concern myself with? Especially considering the decrease in load that accompanies it?

- Anecdotally, it seems that any exercise I do that either (1) heavily involves the hips in a sort of thrusting manner (squats, deadlifts, bridge presses, glute bridges, KB swings) or (2) any exercise done in a prone or laying down position with ample weights, makes me sweat my balls off in little to no time. Is there any logic behind this that anybody can see? (I remember an old article talking about the metabolic effects of [hip swinging](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_metabolic_swing&amp;cr) in brief with an uncited reference to a Michigan study) Or is it possible that an increased cerebral blood pressure could be f-ing with my hypothalamus? (Also, I remember a phenomenon called 'hot pipes' that noted an increase in [thermogenesis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002432059190280O) that was a direct result of increased blood pressure; related?)

**Tl;Dr**

- Assuming I have diet, intra-workout nutrition, supplementation, and both LISS and HIIT cardio down pat; however can I alter a workout schedule to increase fat burning without substantially decreasing the hypertrophic response to weightlifting?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_jzgil,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jzgil/resistance_training_for_fat_loss/,

22 (23 in August), 5’9, ~170 pounds/77kg, brown guy.

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I’ve always considered myself a runner first and foremost, but I also lift. I used to run cross country in high school but was never great. I do 2-3 races yearly, usually 5K or 10Ks.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I have a bunch of medical problems, Diabetes @3, Asthma @10, Graves @16. I was bit chubby as a kid, and not too active. Then I discovered if I pushed myself hard enough I could run faster than most people; I took it, and ran with it (heh, pun). I was otter mode skinny in high school, @5’9, ~130. When I found out I had Graves, I started eating much more and quit track. College rolled around and my Graves was fine but I kept on eating; I got skinny fat freshman 25 style. After that I got motivated and started running again, and added lifting to my routine. I’ve been at it since, sometimes cutting out either lifting or running for a bit though. After graduating, I went back to eating bad and ‘ballooned’ up to 180 pounds. I started doing HIIT 5x a day and cut 15 pounds in 2 months. I’ve since gone back to regular running, because it doesn’t make me want to curl up in a ball and die after. I’ve got a budget home gym and my friend has a good set-up at his house and I usually work out with him. We’ve even recently gotten some other friends into working out too.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes? What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Well there’s nothing advanced about this list but I hit a bunch of PRs this week (tested specifically for the spotlight): 

 * 145 Clean &amp; Jerk
 * 135 Press
 * 195 Clean 
 * 185x3 Bench 
 * 225 Front Squat 
 * 295 Back Squat 
 * 330 Deadlift 

I did 85 pound Tabata squats without puking after recently, which was awful. I once deadlifted 225x20 and I don’t know why, I really don’t.

I hit 1:00 on my 400m recently, haven’t run faster than that since high school. 

I run a barely sub-5 mile, maybe slower now because of BBQ season. 

I run a sub-18 5K, and had a 16:10 5K in high school which was my single greatest fitness achievement. 

My best half time was 1:34, last fall.

**Goals:** I’ve never run a marathon (derp) and would like to run one before I start school again. A 315 squat would be nice before summer ends. I always joke that one day I’m going to run the [Self Transcendence 3100 Mile Race]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Transcendence_3100_Mile_Race). Honestly though, it is something I would love to do, but it seems impossible. GreatCthulu and I talked about this, and he offered some great advice. He basically said if you really want to do something but are worried you can’t, just go ahead and attempt it anyway because at worst you’ll at least have tried. 

If I trained and ended up running even a 50 mile race one day because of it, it’d be a huge win in my book. Trying to bench 300 pounds with a girl spotter though, that’s another story. &lt;3 scotty

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I don’t have a set out fitness plan/training schedule, I just exercise to stay healthy and because I like it. I run every morning; it’s one of my favourite things in the world. I lift 3 times a week, and it’s all the nice fun compound lifts. I do higher volume workouts than most here right now because I’m usually working out with friends and sometimes too lazy to have to change the weight every time. Once upon a time I could squat as much as I deadlifted (275) so I stopped doing them heavy for a while. I did tabata sprints 5x daily to quickly get lean, but stopped after I lost the weight. I don’t recommend anyone do 5 sessions of HIIT a day, it makes you want to curl up into a ball and die. I still do tabata squats though because they’re actually pretty fun.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?
**

Food first:

I’ve started doing Cheat Mode recently on days when I lift and it’s actually a pretty cool way to eat. What I eat: I have what I call my ‘super slop’ which Ivary up a bit from day to day. I also make an awesome milk shake. I have “cheat” days or meals whenever I feel like it. I don’t restrict myself, but try and eat healthy, except for when burgers and bacon are involved. Here’s the recipes:

*Shake:* 

3 cups 1% milk, 1 cup frozen mangos, 1 cup blueberries, 1 banana, 2-3 scoops whey (depending on whether or not it’s a workout day), 1 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tbsp almond butter, 1 tbsp hazelnut butter, 1/4 tsp cinnamon. ~130g carbs, ~90-110g protein, ~40g fat, ~20g fiber

*Super Slop:*

2-3 large eggs, 1-3 cans sardines (or 1 can of herring, +sardines), 1 tsp coconut oil, 1 cup spinach, 1 cup broccoli, 1/2 cup red onions, 1 green pepper, 1-2 cup mushrooms (&lt;3), spices (black pepper, turmeric, red pepper, tandoori) ~30g carbs, ~60g protein, ~35g fat, ~10g fiber

The rest of my diet is rounded out with bacon, berries, apples, oranges, green tea, miso, and lime water. I sometimes have binge days of sashimi+teriyaki.

*Supplements* (the section everyone’s been waiting for?):

A crap load. I used to make my own multivitamin but I finally ran out and I don’t want to invest the effort into making one again, so I’ve “cut back” on supplements. 

[I found a decent multivitamin](http://www.iherb.com/Source-Naturals-Life-Force-Multiple-180-Capsules/20835?at=0) (I take 1 pill, not 4), 5000IU Vitamin D, 1mg Vitamin K, 20mg Zinc, 250mg Magnesium, 2g ALCAR, 2g Beta-Alanine, 2g Taurine, 2g Creatine, 100mg R-ALA, 200mg Coenzyme Q10, 200mg Grape Seed Extract, 2g Alpha-GPC(Choline), 2g Inositol, 2g Citrulline Malate, 2g Arginine, 2g Lysine. 

I don’t take fish oil because I eat so much fish, and I guess the whey protein counts as well.

If you’re going to supplement anything: 

Protein(if you don’t get enough)&gt;Vitamin D&gt;Fish Oil (if you don’t eat fish)&gt;Choline (low egg/fish consumption or endurance athletes)&gt;Vitamin K(if you don’t eat enough green veggies)&gt;everything else is my opinion.

I can see this one’s getting a lot of questions… I also put stuff into my shampoo to combat hair loss. My dad was pretty much bald by 30, and I don’t want that to happen to me.

Oh I also use light/dark therapy throughout the day because I’ve got a weird sleeping schedule and it helps keep me from getting depressed.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

I guess it’s: do what you enjoy, enjoy what you do. 

I can’t really think of any quotes right now, but Bruce Lee has a lot. I especially like [this one]( http://www.warriormindcoach.com/blog/2009/06/08/bruce-lee-and-limits/). 

Also: make sure you’re eating properly and keeping your mobility, and everything else should work out okay.

**What challenges do you face?**

Super-saiyan laziness (I promise I’ll update the Vitamin D article soon!), and I guess to a degree my diabetes. If I’ve ever lagged behind though, I know it has very little to do with that, and everything to do with simply not working hard enough to reach my goals. Almost anything can be overcome with enough hard work, dedication, and know how.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I set goals for myself and see if I can achieve them. If I don’t achieve my goal, I try again next time. On long runs (not on the track) no motivation needed, I just enjoy watching the world fly by. I work out because it makes me happy, that’s motivation enough.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I’m lucky this way in that I don’t really have naysayers. Any time people have been wary of something I do, I’ll just show them why it’s perfectly fine/potentially healthy like with intermittent fasting. I’ve got pretty supportive friends and family, it’s nice.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

If it’s from you guys, I’ll take it =D. Honestly, if something seems reasonable I’ll use my super powers of critical thinking and reasoning, maybe look up more information and take the advice if it still seems sound. I’ll ignore most bro-science (unless stated as such), but sometimes even then I’ll look it up and look around. 

I love learning, so if tells me anything, I’ll look into it.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

If every person ate a healthy diet it would eliminate 80%+ of the health problems in the world. 

*What’s a healthy diet Herman* you ask? If you’re eating a tin of sardines, a cup of broccoli, a cup of berries, and maybe a Vitamin D supplement daily, that’s a good start. (This is my advice to just about everyone whenever they have a diet related question because it’s almost always the answer).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I’m double jointed in my shoulders, so I’m always somewhat weary of lifting stuff over my head. I injured my pancreas as a kid, and my thyroid more recently (heh).

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Rest, eat properly, and listen to whatever troublesome/phrakture/failon/etc… say.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

My first year Anatomy &amp; Physiology book, The International Journal Of Sport Nutrition And Exercise Metabolism (and science journals in general)

**Anything else you want to add?**

Non-fitness related stuff about me: I like helping people, and I love science/biology/nutrition (could anyone haved guessed) and I’d like to combine my two passions and become a doctor. I sometimes get a bit agitated when people misinterpret me/are hardheaded and then I 515x3.

While I waited, I looked around at his neighbors and wondered if they realized that they lived next door to one of the strongest guys in the world.  Inside, I hear Kroc grumbling to himself.  He had lost track of time dealing with some family drama on the phone.  The door then opened and he warmly greeted me with a solid handshake.  He apologized for being a bit scatterbrained and asked if it was ok that he scoffed down some breakfast before we started training.  I couldn't imagine telling this guy he had to skip a meal on my account.  So I sat at his kitchen table with him for nearly an hour, picking his brain as he ate half a box of rice crispies cereal with 3-4 bananas on top. 

Many people are familiar with Kroc rows, but [he's known](http://asp.elitefts.com/qa/default.asp?qid=53824&amp;tid=126) for the same level of intensity in all of his training.  He's detached both biceps, both triceps (multiple times), [a quad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQT_zbJ5Yg), torn his calf, a lat, and a pec, plus screwed up his back in numerous ways. He's also minus one nut due to cancer.  Yet he always comes back stronger and currently holds the world record for the 220 lb. weight class (2,551 lb. total lifted).  One of the things I wanted to learn from him was how he manages to do this.

His short answer was literally *""...nothing but a bump in the road. There is no secret to any of this.  What it takes is sustained hard work.""* He's completely accepted injuries (even major ones) simply as part of training and talked about them with the same caviler attitude that most of us mention a missed PR attempt.  He stressed that it's 100% mental and that many promising careers were cut short because the people just weren't mentally tough enough to come back from an injury.  But he also mentioned  Dave Tate warning him how his own body has paid the price over the years of playing the game hard.

I didn't get the impression that Kroc's obsessed though; he seemed to be able to turn the intensity on and off at will.  He's also very much a family guy and spent as much time talking about his kids as he did his powerlifting.  He's also into creative endeavors and has a smart business sense.  Kroc's success seemed to be the product of extreme discipline and a desire to see how far he can go.

I'm just wondering how many people here have a similar attitude?  Do you consider this reckless or is it necessary in order to test and grow your limits?  (And I do feel this a fair comparison.  Kroc isn't a genetically gifted lifter; he's naturally a slim guy who's simply worked his ass off and risked a lot to accomplish what he's done.  He's also not a pro-athlete and still trains by himself in a small home gym in his basement).",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_ia24x,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ia24x/smart_crazy_vs_stupid_crazy_are_injuries_a/,

I bust my ass with the bench press and get nowhere fast. It's taken me a year to get from 165x5 to 190x5. I feel that I have to either 1) start dumbbell benching as my primary exercise and hope for the best or 2) shock the hell out of my system with some heavy pushing work. 

I came across the Smolov Jr., which I think I'm going to try for the next three weeks (along with CaptainSarcasmo). It should give me some good experience and confidence under the bar. Quite a few people have reported 20-35lb gains in three weeks.

*****

As for assistance work, I was going to continue with 5/3/1 squats and deadlifts on Mondays and Fridays with heavy upper-body pulling work on Wednesdays. I'm going to avoid any tricep, shoulder, or chest work. The only thing I'm worried about is aggravating the shoulders, so I'll probably add some rotator cuff pre-hab.

Continuing with intermittent fasting + bulking; high carbs, high protein, moderate fat.

 I am solely committed to the sport of rowing, though I cross train in other activities, ie weightlifting, cycling, running, nordic skiing. Rowing is where I compete.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

First year of university I was looking at all the clubs and teams and I saw the rowing club recruiting. They had a sign that said, ""Most Olympians don't start rowing till University"". So I joined up, did a learn to row and then tried out for the novice team. I was not athletic at all, but I was tall so that helped. I rowed novice for a year, then rowed recreationally for a year and a half. Halfway through my third year I started to become more serious, training twice a day, and now here I am.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

My number one goal is a gold medal at the 2016 summer Olympics in any boat.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I am used to doing 2x a day, 6 days a week, sometimes I do 3x a day and often I will ride 40 km a day while commuting. To be more specific in the workouts I do, 6x a week a are minimum on the water. Usually those are 1x a day and in the mornings. Then I will do weights 3x a week and the remaining workouts are either more rowing or dry land training (biking, running, pilots, cross country skiing).

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Given my BMR and my fitness requirements I need to eat about 6,000 kcal a day. Honestly, I eat whatever I want and as much as I can. My main concern is eating enough. As I am an endurance athlete I need a diet of about 50% carbs and the rest is split between fats and protein. I focus on eating a lot of veggies and fruits as I need that much food my nutrients are easily taken in. I refuse supplements and I actively dislike them. I see the as a ""supplement"" something to help you on top of your diet. You should be able to get it all from your diet. There are rare cases where you do need supplements such as some women and iron.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

I placed 3rd at my first attempt at nationals last year in the Single. My best 2K is around 6:20. Not great, but it's fairly decent.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Make every workout count. Every workout you do is making you better, every one you miss you get worse. Remember, the gold medal goes to the one who quits last.

**What challenges do you face?** 

My biggest problem is that I have never been in a crew of guys. So I am always rowing by myself and I never have anyone faster than myself in local training to push myself. Plus when you are up at 0430 every day to row in every weather condition it takes a lot of motivation.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I have two sources of motivation. The first is my coach, when I start slacking I typically will get taken aside and get ""the talk"" where they talk to me like they are disappointed saying something along the lines of ""If you want to achieve your goals you need to be working harder than you have…"". The second source of motivation is myself as I know what is taken to get that gold so whenever I am tired and don't feel like working out I think, ""Do I want that gold? Yes. Then I have to workout at every chance and do not let my fitness slip. If I don't go, then someone else is just getting better than me.""

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I don't really have any nay-sayers. I tell everyone my goal because that way if I give up I will have to tell all these people why I stopped rowing. My only real issues is that I am in the military so sometimes it is hard to workout 2x a day when I am on a military course where I am not even in a city where they have a rowing club. My SO is a national water-polo athlete so she knows exactly what it takes to get to the elite level. She often does workouts with me and I met her through rowing.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I completely ignore advice on r/fitness, it is a bunch of bro-science. Doing only squats, eating no carbs and doing only HIIT won't help me with rowing and that's all they prescribe. My advice comes from my coaches as well I've done some readings by elite rowing coaches Volker Nolte and the endurance athlete coach Joe Friel.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Too much protein is actually bad for you. Typically anything in excess is never good, even GOMAD is ridiculous because it's too much milk. But back to protein, if someone starts ingesting a LOT of protein it makes your blood go acidic so your kidneys have to work harder to keep your blood pH at the right level. When you eat a LOT (we are talking 500g/day) of protein it makes your kidneys work too hard and will damage them.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I don't really have any tricks in my training because my training plan is basically to put in a million miles. I guess my only trick is when I start a race. When we start a race we are sitting still at full catch with the blades in the water waiting for the signal to go. This puts you in a very tippy situation so my tip is that I ""back"" the boat to move it in the other direction so when I hear, ""GO!"" I can lay down the power with my legs and get moving without ""washing out"" the blades (when they come out of the water because you aren't balanced).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

The most common injury in my sport is fractured ribs because elite athletes work so hard that their muscles get stronger than their bones and you breath so hard you can easily fracture them. My injuries have been limited to bursitis on the knee and a hyper-mobile L5-S1 joint. The first came from over training when I wasn't used to 2x a day, 6 days a week. The second came from not having proper technique and laying down the power which caused the shearing motion.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Injuries suck, you can't keep training and if you do you are going to hurt yourself more. My only advice with any injury is to take care of it right away, rest it and let it heal. It may suck but it is better than getting hurt worse and never competing again.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

[RowingCanada](http://www.rowingcanada.org/home) is what I go to for a lot of national development information. [Row2k](http://www.row2k.com/) has a lot of random rowing information and big regatta results. [RowingNews](http://www.rowingnews.com/) has a lot of good rowing news and articles.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

Never just take any fitness and nutritional advice from randoms off the internet, you really need to learn the whys of things instead of just accepting. Also, because something worked for one person doesn't mean it will work for everyone. Also, r/fitnesscirclejerk is an awesome subreddit if you want to make fun of r/fitness.

1295406195.0,27,self.AdvancedFitness,f4uk2,"Why I think walking lunges (or forward lunges) are not useful at all and should be avoided altogether:
",33,6,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f4uk2/why_i_think_walking_lunges_or_forward_lunges_are/,"I was reading [this](http://charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/449/A_Few_Words_with_Weightlifting_Coach_John_Broz.aspx) interview by John Broz (of Pat Mendes fame) and he mentions that he hates lunges because it’s an unnatural movement – you never see a child lunge to pick up something. His exact quote is “I consider the lunge the worst exercise ever invented [..] Because it’s not a natural movement. You never see a child lunge to pick something up – they squat. What happens with this movement is that you often end up using a weight that is too heavy and you end up twisting your knee and becoming injured, especially with women because of the angle of the knee joint. I told my old girlfriend never to do lunges, and one day she sneaked into the women’s only section of the gym and did them heavy as I just described. She ended up tearing a meniscus and was in a leg brace for seven months, and she had problems with that knee for the next five years. You can get the same or better benefits from doing a squat, and it’s much, much safer.”

This got me thinking, I’ve never found the forward lunge to be a natural movement. A lot of my coaches have prescribed them for me and I’ve always SUCKED at it. I’m talking 350lbs squat and struggling with 25lb DB’s for walking lunges. My knee always went over my toes or I’d land on my toes or some form of bad technique, even though I spent a shitload of time trying to straighten out my technique. It’s not something that comes intuitively, and I feel that something that anything you can’t learn fast is not a good idea to be performing, especially weighted.  So I’m going to pick it apart and try and prove that forward lunging is not a good idea.
Now I must mention that I’m mostly talking about the forward lunge, or walking lunge. I feel that the reverse lunge and drop lunge does have a lot of benefit, especially when it comes to overloading a single leg stance, something that cannot be safely done on pure single leg exercises like pistols.

From my observations, the lunge cannot be found in most applications of life. And the only sports in which lunging is predominant is fencing, martial arts, skating and volleyball. BUT, in all of these sports, the angle of the torso is always at ~45 degrees. The torso is never straight up. The only time the torso is straight up when on the feet is at the top speed of a sprint. Look at [this](http://sportsblog.projo.com/bolt0819.jpg) picture of Usain Bolt starting his sprint. The torso is angled forward, putting more stress on the hip flexors and quads at this point, and when attaining [top speed](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/20/article-0-02A68C8A000005DC-367_306x423.jpg), the torso shifts into more of an upright angle which allows the glutes to take over the movement for maximum backwards drive. While the lunge will be beneficial for top speed movement, IMO the glute bridge is way more beneficial because the angle between the lower leg and upper leg when bridging is extremely close to sprinting. And because of the force vector in a glute bridge, it’s way more related to sprinting. In fact Brett Contreras mentioned that after adding glute bridges to his football players’ regimen, they all saw a decrease in sprint time.

This article is not for the fencers and martial artists, mostly because I have never done those sports. Maybe somebody who has experience in either can chime in with their thoughts on how it pertains. However, I will talk about volleyball and skating, two of the more dominant sports in terms of lunging. Speaking as a volleyball player, I can safely say that there is almost no time in which you resemble the position of a forward lunge, [you always lunge forward and bend at the waist to get the ball](http://content5.videojug.com/ec/ec2a9381-c334-e270-31a6-ff0008c9d4d8/how-to-forearm-pass-a-volleyball.WidePlayer.jpg?v2). Of course there are exceptions, but this is the norm. In skating too, [the body is in a forward lean](http://83.166.161.30/images/uploads/main_images/Speed-Skating.jpg), thus heavily recruiting the posterior chain.

Look at this video of a [forward lunge](http://www.ehow.com/video_2360533_forward-lunge-training-exercises.html). I’d say that’s a pretty standard technique, though I’ve seen people stress about taking a bigger step. Anyway look at the start position of the movement. The weight is on the back foot and the body leans a bit backward in order to keep the weight off the front foot until contact with the ground. When is an athlete ever in this position? The answer is deceleration. After a 100m sprint, the athlete leans backwards and takes a longer stride in order to dissipate force and to slow down. The forward lunge is touted as deceleration intense and the reverse lunge is more about acceleration. There’s no doubting that. However, everything done in the weight room trains the deceleration component. That’s what an eccentric contraction is. You squat down slowly, and that’s training deceleration, it’s done so that the body doesn’t slam into the floor. I don’t think you need any more specific training on how to slow down, the body is smart enough to know how to slow down to stop damage to itself. It’s like taking football players and beating the hell out of them, because that’s what happens in a game. The major players in slowing down are the hamstrings. Train them with a 5 second eccentric tempo, and you’ll be golden.

Another common thing I hear is from Mike Boyle. He states that lunges (and Bulgarian split squats) are superior to squatting because his athletes can push 200lbs in a split squat while they can’t squat 400. Two answers to that, specificity does not carry over – with his argument, powerlifters who squat a grand should be able to do lunges with 500lbs. And two, the lunge is not a strict single leg movement. The back leg is helping with the movement, even if it’s very little. It helps in stabilization and adds a bit of power to the movement. If you want a true one leg movement, try a pistol or a step-up.

I must stress that I am in no way bashing the reverse lunge, the Bulgarian split squat or the side lunge. I feel that these are very important movements and overloading them is easier than overloading the forward lunge. It’s also safer for the knee than the forward lunge. I love the reverse lunge and BSS because it puts the body into a forward lean, it’s pretty hard to do these exercises with a straight torso (unless you step in really close to the other leg), and so it’s pretty specific to sports. 

What I wrote above is opinion, and in no way fact. I could be completely wrong about this, but I want an intelligent discussion on this instead of somebody telling me that because big time coaches prescribe this, I’m wrong. Thanks for reading.

edit: I forgot to add that the Westside powerlifters, Dave Tate in particular, is very vocal about the uselessness of lunges. And from what I know from working with some Olympic lifters, nobody performs active lunges, they only catch the bar in a lunge position - they never dip down",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_f4uk2,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f4uk2/why_i_think_walking_lunges_or_forward_lunges_are/,

Today's subject is **bodyweight training**. The guys (and girls) over at /r/bodyweightfitness aim to get stronger through just using their bodyweight, without any external weight. Be sure to check out the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq).

A discussion subject to kick it off: comparing the overhead press to the handstand pushup. If you compare a bodyweight (minus arm weight) overhead press to a full range of motion HSPU on parallettes, the HSPU is typically going to be a bit stronger. Why would this be? Also, training for the HSPU typically involves half range of motion: working up to ""headstand pushups"", and then gradually increasing the motion from there. Would there be a better solution?

I've been lifting for 3 years, 1 and half year doing 5/3/1. 6 Months ago I started MMA (I use to be a wrestler). Instead of lifting 4 days a week, I cut down to the 2 day a week split in this article: http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/531_reloaded

What I wanted to know is if I should stick with this workout or go to something more sport-specific? My numbers are fairly good. I weight 185 and I do -

Bench - 300lbs


Squats - 315lbs

Deadlifts - 445 lbs

OHP - 195 lbs

My coach is pushing me to do crossfit. He has it in his gym and for fighters it's 100% free. I'm conflicted about that because of post I've seen on reddit. Plus, my coach never used it to get to where he was. If what reddit says about crossfit is true, he could just be buying into the mumbojumbo from CF's marketing dept.  But then again, I've also seen a guy who's only done crossfit and weighs 145 lbs dead lift almost the same amount as me. 

I'm looking for the best possible workout that will complement MMA game that will keep me strong and also make me more explosive.

This time, in an effort to break up the monotony that comes with training, here are some uncommon fun lifts that I've picked up. 

____
But before we start...

***WARNING: This is PURELY ANECDOTAL (eg- Broscience-ish stuff, only backed up by above average numbers in the weight room). If you want science and studies, in the words of Mr. Wendler, ""fuck you."" ***
____


***Odd Implement (""Slab"") Press***

**What you will need:**

* 
1 [Loading Pin](http://ironmind-store.com/12-Standard-Plate-Loading-Pin-Without-Clip/productinfo/1313/) (often found on a ""[rolling thunder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAdykOiPFTo)"" or other grip trainers) You're gym probably has one, its just hiding in a corner, lonely.

* Bumper Plates (at minimum 2)

* 2(!) Spring Clips (alligator clips won't work.)

* 1 garbage bag

**The Setup:**

Stack desired bumper weights on to the Loading Pin. If you only have 2 bumpers, then SANDWICH the metal plates between your two bumpers. If you want to make smaller jumps (2 1/2 - 10lb) then your bumpers will allow, take the smaller metal plates and put then on top of the stack so they won't break in the middle.

Now that this is done, take your garbage bag and tie it around your first spring clip [like so](http://i.imgur.com/OqpiV.png) The garbage bag will make the clip fit extra tight on the Loading Pin (you should have to shove and twist the clip onto the loading pin.) Take the tail end of the garbage bag, slip them into the 2nd spring clip, and shove that down on top as well. [The finished production should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/C8KHR.png) 

**The Technique:**

For the technical folks out there, this is what my coach calls a ""Strongman Clean"" (it applies to Logs, Atlas Stones, Kegs, Etc. Pretty much anythings that's weird or big)

* Get a grip on the object and deadlift/Stiff leg deadlift the object over your knees

* Squat down (ATG) resting the object on your knees, while simultaneously pulling the object onto your gut/belt.

* Stand and clean object up...

...OR, you can just pick the fucker up and Continental it into a press.

**The Purpose:**

It's an OHP done with an unstable object. I could go on about how it helps stabilization, changes the grip up of the object so it hits muscles in different positions, or the virtues of it's ""functionality"" (*douche chill*)...and it does all these things, but this Odd Lifts edition is about FUN, so give it a shot and have a blast.

**Protip:** 

If you master the lift, an awesome way to challenge yourself is to mix up the weights in the stack. Put the heavier weights on top to make it Top Heavy (...go figure) or Mix em all up so make the clean portion difficult, etc. etc. etc.

**Video Example:**

I had such a good time doing these, I actually decided to video my last set to give you a visual aid &lt;3. Had to run back to the locker room so i could throw on my cargo shorts...gotta be presentable. I opted for the ""pick the fucker up and continental"" technique.

[Abes 140x5 Slab Press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbmEwU6zdXQ)

________

***Hand Over Hand Rope Curl (???)*** 

**You'll need:**

* 1 Ship Rope

* 1 Kettlebell (best option) or Heavy DB

* a Bench/Ledge/Plyo Boxes/ etc. Something to stand on that will get you at least 2ft off the ground (higher you go the harder it is)

**Set Up:**

Tie one end of the rope around the KB/DB, stand on the bench or plyo box (whatever.) Done. [Shitty Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/pPtYm.png)

**The Tech**

Grip the rope so your fists are stacked on top of each other, and your arms are bent at a ~90 degree. Take the slack out of the rope, then walk your top hand under the bottom and repeat (DON'T CHEAT, fists should be touching on each ""rep"") The curling motions shouldn't be more than 5-6 inches. When the knot reaches your hands, lower the weight in the same fashion. When the weight touches the floor that is **1 REP** Try to get 3-5x5.

**The Variations / Purpose**

* Keeping your fists and elbows close to your body will give you an awesome Bi/Grip workout.

* Pushing your fist away from your body and using a more obtuse angle in your arms will give you more of a Shoulder/Grip workout.

* **But, seeing how this post is about FUN, the most important purpose of doing this exercise is yelling slanderous shit at your training partners while they cringe doing their set** 

*Examples:* 

""Your hands are supposed to be touching you fuckin bitch-made cheat!""

""God, you're fuckin ugly dude. look at that face! jesus.""

""*'OW, MY HANDS HURT?!' Rope burn? Foreals? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Hurry the fuck up so i can get my set in...""

...and finally, my favorite knock out punch:

""Hm, I thought you were strong...""

**Warning**: you will be subject to the same ridicule when it's your turn to stand on the podium of shame.

Well, that's it folks. Take'em or leave'em. Hope you all are hitting your goals. Feel free to add your own uncommon fun lifts, and have an awesome weekend.

back to work...booooooo ;(

1310448701.0,26,self.AdvancedFitness,in57j,"Weighted Chins as Biceps Work, Yay or Nay?",30,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/in57j/weighted_chins_as_biceps_work_yay_or_nay/,"I've held the position (solely based on my own experience) that weighted chins are great for biceps development, and possibly superior to direct arm work but only up to a certain point. For someone looking to develop the biceps (in strength), I'd say do weighted chins up to the point of one rep with half bodyweight added (or more if they are lighter), and past that point direct arm work may be more effective. This is pretty much based on intuition and one data point though.

So, does anyone else want to weigh in on this? Possibly post numbers for data?

My direct arm work has been fairly sparse; I've done weighted chins over a couple of years and very little curling. The resulting numbers from that are: 

280lb TOTAL x 3 weighted chin

The reason for the post is, why? I can do 10 good GHRs and keep the tension mostly on the hamstrings and have benefit to my main lifts, but when I do the exact same leg curl motion with the exact same Perceived Exertion and 10 reps of roughly the same resistance, there is no carryover.

Is it solely due to recruitment of the lower back muscles during the GHR, or is there something else?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_idluq,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/idluq/gluteham_raise_versus_other_hamstring_isolation/,

**Age and Sex?** 24yrs 8mo, male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?** 

Current: 

* Danzan Ryu Jujutsu- 9yrs, inherently noncompetitive 

* Powerlifting- 1-2yrs, recreational though I’ve done one meet and plan on doing more

* Highland Games- just started, first games in June 

Past:

* Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iaijutsu- 2yrs, noncompetitive

* Ice Hockey- 3yrs, youth amateur league

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

This story might make more sense if you read the part about injuries first. They’ve done a lot to guide my path... 

A little less than a decade ago, I was introduced to iaijutsu by a good friend and began training. Loved it. Another friend introduced me to jujutsu and I took it up as well, training at both schools until I hurt my knee and had to stop the iaijutsu. A few years later, I broke my clavicle and subsequently had to focus entirely on the healing side of Danzan Ryu, which helped tremendously. 

I enrolled in massage therapy school as soon as I could take falls again. I’ve been licensed and practicing for 4 years now, specializing in the sports med/rehab side of things. My older brother took up powerlifting a couple years back and taught me proper form so I could spot and critique (background in rehab and martial arts helped). 

Initially, I lifted only to supplement my jujutsu, though that changed as soon as I got on a program where I was making PR’s on every lift every month. Probably addicted now. I’m getting into Highland Games because it’s what strong people with Celtic blood should be doing.

Plus, kilts are more comfy than pants (also true of hakama).

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?** 

I want a 600 lbs deadlift and 500 lbs raw squat at less than 240 lbs bodyweight, while somehow remaining agile enough to teach the advanced jujutsu lists. I can dream, can’t I? :P Oh, and I want to successfully turn the caber at least once at the Lehi Highland Games next month.

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

5/3/1 for squat and deadlift, whatever I feel up to for bench and overhead press (1day per week each), jujutsu twice a week for a few hours, and throwing heavy objects and pushing cars about once a week.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet looks like... food? I just finished finals, so my diet’s gone all to hell. I try to get a bunch of protein in the form of shakes, meat, eggs, milk, cottage cheese, etc. I use a multivitamin, B-complex, fish oil, and an ECA stack. Workout drink consists of 5g creatine mono, 10g leucine, 2 scoops Powerade in 1L water. And I drink way too much soda. :(

I also regularly use balms and liniments to boost recovery. I think of them as external supplements. Zheng Gu Shui, Die Da Wan Hua, Dit Da Jow, and PhysioBalm are my mainstays.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?** 

It’s hard to quantify achievements in jujutsu, so I’ll stick to powerlifting for this one. 515 deadlift, 425 squat (sleeves), 455 squat (wrapped), 260 bench press, 175 overhead press. All are recent except the bp and ohp, which were a few months back before I irritated my shoulder again. Hopefully I’ll have more to add to this after this summer.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy**? 

I’ll have to channel Jim Wendler on this one: “Don’t train for fat loss. Train to be a motherfucker.” Just replace ‘fat loss’ with any short-sighted superficial goal and that’s me.

One more that I picked up from one of my brothers as he was prepping for dive school: “Make civil the mind and savage the body.”
But both of those leave some gaps. They’re good mantras, but incomplete by themselves. I don’t believe in any sort of disconnection between mind, body, spirit, and environment. They are all intimately linked and any one can guide and influence the others. I believe a strong body reflects a strong mind, a flexible body reflects a flexible mind. There’s a lot I can say about this, but the more I say the more likely it I am to just complicate the issue... You can think of it like doing compound lifts instead of isolation movements, only with more than just muscle and sinew involved.

**What challenges do you face?** 

I am my own worst enemy. My body is prone to breaking down. I have chronic tendinitis throughout most of my body and I have to train smart to avoid making it flare up. A result of this is that I am very intimately aware of every part of my body, an effect that makes me that much better at any physical pursuit.

Being a student, my financial circumstances prevent me from investing as much as I would like in my health. The number one reason I’m not on a strict diet is because of time and financial constraints. I’m either working, studying, or training and I have very little spare time or spare cash to put toward preparing healthful meals as often as I should. My wife works full time, but thanks to her I usually get at least one decent meal a day. (I’m not a misogynist, just busy.)

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

Curiosity accounts for a lot. Vicarious accomplishment through my clients helps some. I lift so I can have quantifiable progress in some aspect of my life.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I listen to my body and to people with similar goals but much more experience. This rules out the vast majority of the internet.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Most of what I “know” I feel should be common sense, but for some reason isn’t all that common. I can “prove” much of it but usually don’t bother unless I’m working with someone in person. In most cases the proof is a waste of time, like explaining climate change to conservatives. Anyway, the stuff...

Whether training should emphasize mobility or stability in a joint depends on its position, and the emphasis alternates. Ankle- mobility; knee- stability; hip- mobility; lumbar spine- stability; thoracic spine- mobility; cervical spine- stability; jaw- mobility. The pattern doesn’t apply quite as well to the upper limb, where I’m more concerned with overall tissue quality and balance than joint-specific training protocols.

Some massage therapy works. Some is a waste of time and money. Sports massage isn’t a specific modality. It’s any kind of massage done to benefit physical performance. Different approaches work better on different types of athletes and different injuries or imbalances. Most of the massage research that hits the news is either very poorly performed or very poorly reported, but there’s a lot of good stuff out there. That said...

ART is not the be-all, end-all of manual therapy modalities. It certainly has its place, but that place is smaller than people seem to think. Same goes for Graston, NMT, PNF, MET, pin-and-stretch, structural integration/Rolfing, and every other “high-end” modality.

They’re all tools with specific applications. That’s why more integrative approaches like Russian Sports Massage form the foundation of my treatments. I can incorporate any specific techniques I need to while still working toward an overall goal to improve the performance of every system of the body.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Let’s see...  

* Fractured left clavicle in a bad fall from kesa nage, damaged the nerves to the shoulder capsule. 

* Loss of proprioception and pain led to multiple small tears to rotator cuff and possible SLAP lesion from stuff like shoveling snow. 

* Unaware of soft tissue injuries until the next day when the swelling was obvious. 

* Ongoing problem that interferes with lifting.

* Deep bone bruise to medial condyle of left femur, no soft tissue damage aside from secondary tissue damage in the knee capsule from swelling. Not training related, but resulted in having to quit iaijutsu. 

* Dislocated or sprained all of my toes multiple times, sometimes all simultaneously. Also sprained a lot of fingers, but no dislocations. 

* Stress fractures in both ulnas due to severe periostitis at origin of flexor digitorum profundus. Probably from a combination of increased volume on deadlifts, bench press, and caber curls. 

* Chronic tendinitis across most major joints. 

* Dislocated three ribs and subluxation of associated vertebrae, combined with something resembling sprained costal cartilages from a high back fall onto some moron’s heel on a pointless throw called mizukuguri.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

I just listen to my body. It sounds simple, but most people aren’t familiar enough with their body to understand what it tries to tell them. Soft martial arts are excellent for developing this familiarity and awareness. My massage and lifting are both better for having studied jujutsu. Likewise, my jujutsu is better for practicing massage and lifting.

Lots of soft-tissue work coupled with rehab exercises and internal/external supplements. I occasionally make use of e-stim and ultrasound as well.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

I’ll have a bunch to list here and the list will grow with time, so I’ll put it in a comment.

**Anything else you want to add?**

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/SSbDj#0) is a link to the tests. Personal data removed from the results for confidentiality although each participant signed an informed consent.

**Bodybuilder-Keto**: At low intensities he is already burning more CHO than Fats and that is at 4-4.5mph 0%grade. As his heart rate increases his RER value reaches pure carbohydrate at 1.00 and he begins to utilize protein as a substrate although it is almost entirely CHO. &gt;1.05 RER usually signifies lactate threshold which means that he isn't going to last much longer or go very far during the test. He was always burning more carbohydrate than fat (percentage utilization) so there wasn't an optimal HRrange to prescribe cardiorespiratory endurance training as anything he can accomplish would be an improvement.

**CrossFit style athlete no dietary restrictions**: This test is on a moderately balanced individual in terms of fitness. He does moderate amounts of cardiorespiratory exercise in comparison to crossfit style resistance training. RER of .77 shows fat being the predominant substrate at low levels of intensity where the balance of CHO/FAT is achieved at 82% of HRmax. He ended with a relative value of 55.6ml/kg/min which is pretty high percentile.

**HIIT low-CHO diet** Collegiate cheerleader performs high intensity interval training or p90x style workouts. Here optimal endurance training HR is also on the low side ~75%HRmax for a 50/50blend of substrate usage. She gets into high CHO usage pretty quickly and at low intensities although her body wants to run on CHO the low carbohydrate diet might impede performance if there is no substrate available to use.

**Endurance Athlete High-CHO** The significant part of this test is that the endurance athlete burns fat as a primary substrate all the way into the 5th minute of the test where as the other previous subjects went mostly CHO after the 1-3rd minutes and still burned fat until the last 2 stages in comparison to the other tests. The body builder stopped using fats 5 minutes into the test and the CF/HIIT tapered off with 4-5 stages left to go.

**Second Endurance Athlete** Sample times were twice as frequent in this report which gives more specific data and allows greater precision for training zones. This athlete used fat as his dominant fuel source for the first 7 stages and didn't go completely carbohydrate until stage 12. Ideal training zone for max CHO/Fat combined useage would be 165bpm or at an RER of .85

**sedentary obese standard bike protocol** HR wasn't recorded on the data sheet for this test. Notable data are the RER mix being mostly CHO from the start and fat metabolism gone at 8 minutes into the ten minute test. VO2max was achieved at minute 10 and the last ten minutes were to show EPOC and the return to resting VO2 which is typically ~3.5ml/kg/min. The most interesting aspect is the EPOC period where the subject continued to burn strictly carbohydrate for 8 minutes after achieving VO2max during passive recovery signifying extremely high lactate levels as demonstrated by the RER value &gt;1.05",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_lsjua,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/lsjua/graded_exercise_test_results_vo2max_tests/,

[August 2010, when I first arrived in the US, and yesterday]( http://imgur.com/a/DjwMd#HDDyM)


* ** Age?**


I’ll be thirty-six in July.

* ** Sex?**


Extremely male.

* **What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

Currently I lift weights, run and swim  - nothing competitive.

* **What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**


As a teenager, I was a state rep rugby player and sprinter.  At about fifteen years old, I discovered girls, alcohol, cigarettes and acid in a short space of time and pretty much forgot about sports, although I stayed in reasonably good shape. 

After a fairly horrific injury under the influence of heroin in my early twenties, I spent around eighteen months in a wheelchair, then the same again on crutches.  I lost some of the movement in my left ankle and foot permanently and slowly let myself go physically. 

In mid-2009, after one too many bowls of cereal eaten at night, stoned in front of the Wii, I pulled on some pants I’d bought only six weeks earlier to replace the last pair that I’d outgrown, and the button burst off and flew across the room.   I decided to get into shape. 

I dragged my wife’s elliptical trainer in front of the TV, and lasted two minutes the first attempt, but got back on every day until I could make it through three Seinfeld reruns in a row without stopping.  I started eating less – not hard, since I was snacking in the evenings like a madman.  I got down from 235 to 185, bought a bench and some weights, and was hooked pretty fast on lifting.  The only breaks since then have been when the gym is closed. I’m currently 215, but leaner than I was at 185.

* ** What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’m mainly working towards bigger barbell lifts and faster sprints. I’d like my 100m time to get down under 11s and continue to add weight to my major lifts.

* ** What is your workout or training regimen? Feel free to provide as much detail as you want.**

I vary each workout, depending on how I feel and what I feel like focusing on, but roughly speaking, I rotate four workouts: 
* Quads &amp; back
* Shoulders, glutes, hamstrings
* Chest &amp; arms
* Core, complexes
Most workouts consist of one major lift, lots of sets of very low reps (8x3, 10x2, 12x1) at close to max, then between one and six assistance lifts, various rep schemes depending on how much gas is left in the tank after the main lift. I use the assistance lifts to try out different ideas I read about, so they’re fairly inconsistent, anywhere from 3x5 to 10x10 depending on mood, energy, and what I read that morning.
Previously, I’ve had good results from Stronglifts, Practical Programming and Wendler’s 5/3/1.

* **What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

Supplements are the usual boring stuff – whey, BCAAs, fish oil, creatine.

My diet has two modes, depending on whether I’m stalled or not on lifts.  If I’m stalling and feeling lean, I eat like a maniac, all hours of the day and night. GOMAD, 4,000 calorie post-workout binges, fast food, good food, awful food, you name it.  If I’m progressing fine and trying to keep an eye on body fat, then I do intermittent fasting on an 18/6 or 20/4 basis. No calories until after my workout, then the vast bulk of my daily calories in the first ninety minutes after lifting, followed by a light meal at dinner time. 
[Here]( http://imgur.com/a/tkw91#mX2NJ) are examples of a normal lunch, and a bulking lunch.

* **What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

Back in the day, I ran a 10.58 in the 100m. More recently, OHP: 212.5lbs, Deadlift: 495lbs, Bench: 247.5lbs. 

* **What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

Outside the gym, I am just trying to be best me I can be; I’m incredibly happily married, looking forward to starting a family, and want to a healthy and strong husband and father. In the gym, it’s PR or ER, basically. I’m there to break records, and work until I drop. 
I do seek out as much information about what I’m doing as possible; I’ve known too many people who worked hard, but not smart, and failed to get anywhere.  

* **What challenges do you face?**

I’m a late starter, which brings a good share of added risk to lifting, and I’m a bit crippled – I’ve got almost no tibialis anterior (the muscle over the shin bone) on my left side, 

Being married to someone with very different dietary habits is challenging – less so during semester when we only eat together every couple of days. 

* **How do you motivate yourself?**

It’s not much of a challenge, except for long-distance runs in mid-winter. I pretty much just keep in mind that mental strength is what ultimately divides competitors from no-shows.

* **How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

It’s harder in Australia, where I have a bunch of friends who don’t like seeing me improve myself, and aren’t above using fairly overt peer pressure to keep me on the couch, drinking beer and watching TV.  They’re all eagerly waiting for me to return, fat from the American lifestyle :D


* **What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Much like silverhydra said last week, I take plenty of good advice, but I don’t rest enough, or give myself enough recovery time. I guess the advice I ignore is “slow down, old man, or you’ll hurt yourself”.

* **What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

I don’t have the physiology or dietetic grounding to prove anything; I guess for controversial opinions, I believe that if you time your meals correctly, you can stack on incredible amounts of lean mass by eating all sorts of fun shit. I’ve managed to maintain fat levels while growing alarmingly fast on 5-6,000 calorie a day diets.

* **Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?**

I do a lot of conditioning work, but keep it completely separate from lifting; I think this is key. Crossfit-style conditioning workouts seem wasteful to me, kind of half-doing everything at once; Lifting heavy then jumping on a treadmill for an hour also doesn’t do it for me.  I like to split things into days – for me, it’s three lifting days (most weeks), three conditioning days (two for sprints and one for weight complexes) and one for endurance cardio (10k run). 


* **Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Familiarity is important for peak performance. If you study in the room where the exam will take place, you’ll do better. The same sort of thing applies to lifting. When I go for a new max for OHP, for example, I’m wearing the same top, using the same plates, holding the same bar, listening to the same part of the same track on my headphones, at the same volume and standing in front of the same rack. Find the exact conditions you last set a record in, and maybe you’ll find the same headspace and attitude, too.

* **What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

Apart from the issues with my leg mentioned above, I have a herniated disc at L5-S1 (lower back) which makes leg work very difficult at times.  It’s stopped me deadlifting, keeps my squat in the extremely shitty range, and generally hurts and frustrates me.  I also have recurring tendinitis in my right wrist, which hasn’t flared up in a while but has taken me out of action more than once.

* **Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

Patience. Maybe you have to miss a few days lifting, or go light for a while, but if you ignore that, you could end up taking a year off.

25, Male, 5'10"", Walk around above 180

This was my 7th marathon but my first time running Boston.  I qualified last summer with a time of 3:04.  My previous PR was a 3:10 in 2008.  I ran Boston in 3:54 and change.

I don't know how many of you followed this year but the weather was forecast to be one of the hottest Boston Marathon's in history with a high close to 90F. The BAA was scrambling to make arrangements and even offered registration deferment (unprecedented) to encourage people to not run.

*****

**Training**

I was pretty happy with the training plan that I developed for last summer's PR marathon.  I ran M Tu W F Sa with a speed workout on Tu, sprints on W, and a long run on Saturday.  I also did this while lifting weights (Madcow) M W F.  Had I been going for another PR I would have used this again.  Instead, I made the decision, shortly after qualifying, to take Boston easy and allow myself to take my lifts up and maybe gain a little weight.  My training plan this time around was run on M Th Sa with a speed workout on Th and a long run on Saturday.  I also cross trained on Wednesday, usually on the bike or elliptical.  For lifting, I stuck with 5/3/1 BBB with squats on M, bench on Tu, deadlift on Th, and press on F.  This worked out well for all lifts except the squat (which I ended up having to 90% deload) and I even hit a deadlift PR for the r/weightroom contest.  

My long run progression was like this: 10, 12, 14, 16, 13, 18, 20, 13, 20, 13, 8.

There is a lot of debate about taking your long run over 20 miles.  Had I been going for an aggressive time, I absolutely would have.  In training for the 3:04 I went up to 23.  This time around though, it simply wasn't worth the increased injury risk and the extra time needed to recover.  

*****

**Leading up to the race**

I live in Boston so that made matters pretty easy.  I went to the expo on Saturday to pick up my race packet.  Other than that, I  tried to stay off my feet and take it easy.  My taper had me running easy 4 milers on Monday and Thursday and an easy 2 miles on Sunday.   

For nutrition, I was eating significantly more carbs than I usually do, mostly in the form of bread and fruit.  I decided to standardize my diet and eat mostly the same stuff for 5 days in a row.  My dinners consisted of bread, soup, pork chops and kale.  The night before the race I ate the same thing but just increased my bread portion.  For supplements, I stopped creatine a few weeks before the race, upped my fish oil to 6 pills a day, and continued to take ZMA, D, and a multi. 

*****

**Race Morning**

I woke up a 5 AM, a half hour before my 5:30 alarm.  I had a light breakfast that included a cup of coffee, whey protein and water, and some bread and butter.  I popped 3 fish oil pills, and stretched a bit.  I then made my way down to the Boston Common to catch one of the provided buses that take runners to the start in Hopkington.  Everything went smoothly and I was at the start around 7:30.  There, I laid down and relaxed in the sun, munching on the saltines and Nutella that I made the night before and sipping on a 64 oz Gatorade.  

At this point, I still had not completely decided my race strategy.  The weather was approaching record highs and I was nervous.  I knew I was in shape to finish but this would be the hottest race I have ever run and all of my training was done in sub 60 degree weather.

At 9:15, I made the short walk from ""runner's village"" to the actual start.  I stopped at the bathroom along the way and was able to take a small poop (this is always something that I worry about prior to the race because I'm nervous that I'll cramp along the way).   

*****

**The Race**

[Splits](http://i.imgur.com/V5nCQ.png)

The start is about 80 degrees.  I made the decision to start at the pace that I was training to run the race in (7:45) and slow down when/if my body needed to.  I was seeded for Wave 1, Corral 4 but decided to start in Corral 6 due to my slower pace.  

Everything started smoothly and I ran the the first mile a little fast because it was downhill.  I was running at a slightly slower pace than the people around me so I didn't have to worry about weaving around people.  I made the decision to hit every aid station along the way on principal (in the past I would skip the crowded ones even if I was thirsty to not lose time).  I grabbed both Gatorade and water, sipping the Gatorade and dumping the water on my head.  

Everything continued to go well and I felt pretty decent, just hot.  Listening to my body, I slowed down a bit.  I finished the first half on pace to run a 3:30 race.  At the half, I could feel the heat and lack of shade starting to get to me and the Newton hills starting at mile 16 began to worry me a bit.  This was also when I started seeing a few people collapse on the side of the road.

I approached the first hill at a gradually decreasing pace and ended up walking some of it.  This repeated itself all the way through heartbreak.  Coming out of heartbreak I was really starting to feel hot and worn down.  There was almost no shade to be found and at this point the Gatorade and water was far too warm to offer any cooling effect.  I chugged along, spurred on by the dense crowds on Beacon street.  There were a few really minor hills that, even being from Boston, I had never noticed before.  Mentally, these were tough and I succumbed to walking up them.  Approaching Kenmore Square, about two miles out, I knew I had friends coming up so I made it a point not to walk anymore.  I also knew that I was coming dangerously close to 4 hours, a mark that I had only gone past on my first marathon.  I finished as strong as I could, getting support from groups of friends.  Turning the corner onto Boylston was tough though.  It was a stretch that I had walked down many times before but it never seemed as long as it was that day.  I finished under 3:55.  The temperature at the finish line was 87F.

*****

**Recovery**

I actually felt pretty damn good after this race.  Usually I am really sick for a day or two but this time around I felt great (probably because the reduced pace and the extra effort I made to stay hydrated).

I met up with my mom and gf and took the T back to my apartment.  I took a cold shower and munched on some saltines for a bit before I laid down.  I laid down for about 3 hours but was starting to really feel really hungry.  I actually felt good enough to get up and go out to eat so we went for sushi and froyo.  I then met up with some friends for celebratory beer and we watched the Bruins (GO Bs).  This week I've obviously been sore but nothing has bothered me too badly.  I plan to get back to lifting and some light running on Monday.

About three years ago i got in a car accident and had my left leg amputated about eight inches above the heel, or just above the ankle. I have however, managed to stay active and regularly train and exercise. the problem i come to yall with today is that through the course of my training my remaining leg has become very dominant in my lifting and has caused a fairly large muscle imbalance. My left leg is much smaller than my right, meaning my quad, hamstring, and glute. Also my left spinal erector is much larger, probably due to me using my back to compensate for inflexibility issues early on. So d be my question to yall is; what would be the best way to even the muscle mass out?

How do YOU do it?,28,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/loobq/running_lifting_how_do_you_do_it/,"As the title implies, I've been having some serious problems with my running as I've increased my intensity in the weight room.

Me:

27 yo Male. 5'11"", 170lbs. Been running for about 3 years, and lifting seriously for just under 1 year. I began SS at the beginning of the year and I'm definitely happy with my progress. Right now I am at:

Squat: 3x5x285

Bench: 3x5x170

Dead: 1x5x325

Press: 3x5x120

My running, however has been a serious chore since I've started lifting. At the end of last year, my PR's were a 1:40:55 Half-Marathon, a 22:23 5k, and a 1:10:42 15k (the 15k was after I started SS and had started to show the signs of fatigue in my legs). Lately I've been lucky to keep an 8:00min pace for a simple 4-miler.

All year has been kind of a bust in the running department. I got discouraged due to the difficulty of what should have been easy runs, so my weekly miles dropped down a bit, and now when I try to get out and get some miles in, it destroys me much more than my workouts in the weightroom.

SO, onto the queries...Is this a normal phenomenon? Is it simply that the low rep heavy weight lifting is counterproductive to endurance sports? If you did experience this, what did you do to fix it? Diet? Sleep? Stimulants?

**tl;dr** I feel like lifting heavy has destroyed my endurance. Any fixes?

**Two Bar Lever Deadlift / Grappler Deadlift**

What you will need:

* 2 barbells
* 2 heavy (&gt;70) dumbbells
* Straps (or not, but its highly recommended)

The Setup:

Now if you actually had a Grappler, you probably already know this lift, if not, 
Place the Two dumbbells side by side against a wall. Slide the 2 barbells under each DB handle. Load up the Weights on the other side, and viola, homemade grappler. [Shitty diagram i drew up](http://i.imgur.com/IBCKm.png)

The Technique:

- Stand Between the two Bars with your toes roughly 1-2 inches away from the plates.

- Strap in (or simply grip) all the way up to the Barbell Sleeve.

- Drop into your deadlift position (assuming you do not dead sumo)

- Now here is where things get a little different, Begin your deadlift, When the bar begins to reach your knees, you must load your heels, and thrust your hips forward. This should put you at a slight angle leaning back (THIS IS WHY STRAPS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)

Purpose:

This movement helps the lifter stay off their toes, because based on the anchoring of the bars this lift simply CANNOT be done if you don't load your heels. Furthermore, this lift requires the lifter keep their chest up. If a person where to start this lift with their chest down and on their toes, the angle and anchoring of the movement would lock their body into the down position. The most important thing i learned in this movement was how to push my hips through. This is the hardest idea to teach someone on the deadlift. The hips do not come up, they push through. 
Also for the bodybuilder out there, you wont find a better quad pump! 

[Here is a video of it being done properly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMPBhGSZS8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=21s)

_______________

**Banded OHP**

You'll need:

* 1 Barbell
* 2 bands
* Power Rack with Pins or Heavy DBs (&gt;70)

Set Up:

Loop the Bands around the pins in the rack, throw ends of the band on the bar, easy. (might take some fooling around to get the right pin position for the proper band tension.)

Purpose:

If you spent anytime in the weight room, immediately you'd see the benefits of shoulder and core stability you can get from this lift, but thats not why I decided to showcase it. The biggest thing this variation of the OHP taught me was how to get my head through and under the bar quicky, while maintaining a straight back. Often I see people do what they call a OHP, when really they are doing a weird standing incline bench (from hell.) The bands do not allow this. You must shot your head through in order to finish the lift. I credit this variation for boosting my OHP PR from 275 to 315 over a few months.

Wow, first question? No dinner and a movie first? Straight to the pics? Ouch. We'll see when we get to the end of the questionnaire.

**Age?** 43

**Sex?** Male

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? Do you compete at any level?**

I lift weights at my local YMCA, at a novice's ""Starting Strength"" level, and I run, mostly using High Intensity Interval Training. I do not compete.

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?**

I've run on and off for over a decade, with my best period coming when I was about 33. I do it entirely for fitness and well-being purposes, and I chose running at the 10K distance mostly because I could do it at a training pace a few times a week, and I felt great doing it.

When I turned 42 (last year), I had been reading /r/fitness for a bit, and I saw a heated thread about the value of Starting Strength/SL vs. other fitness approaches, and frankly the people who were arguing for Starting Strength had very strong arguments, didn't overstate their case, and backed it up with references. I decided to give it a whirl, started with Strong Lifts, swapped to Starting Strength in a few months, an have enjoyed it since.

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I'm still a weight lifting novice. I have a workweight of 1.2x BW for my squats, and when I hit 1.5xBW 3x5, I'll be psyched. I've also been eeking toward a 300lb deadlift (most recently at 270lbs) 1x5.
You'll notice that by any objective consideration involving other fitness people, these are pretty low lifts. I'm just not as athletic as other /r/fitness mods are. But I'm keeping my eye on it.

**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I adhere to 3x a week in the weight room, doing ABA BAB for Starting Strength, plus a few auxilliary lifts to move me past rough spots. I move in HIIT runs (8 reps, 30 sec on, 30 sec off) when I can, and it doesn't negatively impact my energy level in the weight room.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?**

I just finished 3 months trying to drink as much milk as possible (usually 1 qt a day, on average, but often more) in addition to a 2400 calorie/day diet, with 180gm protein (I weigh 180lbs now, with, I estimate, 18% fat), and the rest in carbs and fat. I take the following supplements: 5000 IU Vitamin D; 3 tsp Omega 3 fish oil; 1.5 tsp Beta Alanine. 1 tsp creatine.

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?**

 * Squat: 215lbs 3x5
 * Deadlift: 270lbs 1x5 (no chalk, no belt, no gloves)
 * Bench: 140lbs 3x5
 * OHP: 100lbs 3x5 (actually, 95lbs; I'm working at 100lbs, but haven't 
quite done it).
 * Cleans: 105lbs 3x5

And, I run 8 reps (30 sec hard, 30 sec recovery) HIIT with a heart rate at 170 BPM. Kills me.

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?**

There is really only one criterion for success: whether or not I am happy. If I am not happy, I do whatever I must to change that.

**What challenges do you face?**

I have no significant challenges. I am aware of a gap between my potential and my fitness level, and if I do have a challenge, it's committing myself sufficiently to close that gap.

**How do you motivate yourself?**

I lead a busy life, and fitness is just one factor in my happiness. I don't have to motivate myself toward fitness to make myself happy, but I do have to sometimes re-balance myself toward fitness to make myself happier.

And to do that, I simply look in a mirror, and ask myself: ""Is this the most fit I want to be before I die? Because if I do nothing, this is as good as it gets."" And then I get myself out there.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I have no such naysayers. I am not partnered up. My friends let me do what I want, and are generally supportive of whatever choices I might make for myself. Moreover, I don't discuss my fitness habits with anyone IRL, with the exception of my brothers (who are a bit like me: they don't like to be told what to do by others, and prefer to discover their own thing, on their own). If I were to get a direct question about it, I always, always play it off: ""Oh, thanks -- nice of you to notice. You got those TPS reports for me? Today's Tuesday you know.""

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

I accept form advice which is backed up by my own internet research. I ignore any advice from anyone who, upon questioning, appears to know less than I do about fitness (which, it should be noted, is not remarkably much).

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?**

 * I loose awesome weight running HIIT, above all else.
 * There is a fitness level at which one becomes physically attractive, quantifiable using only three numbers: your 1RM DL as a multiple of bodywieght, your 1 RM back squat (also as a multiple of BW), and your bodyfat %. And I wish to god some researcher would work these out. It would save a lot of arguing on /r/fitness, and a lot of uncertainty among novices.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

Well, its not unique I think but from day one, I did weighted side crunches on my obliques; I now hold a 45lb dumbell on my head in a roman chair while I side-crunch. Aside from the wide-eyed stares of 20 year-olds who could surely whip my ass, I'm pretty sure that I made major gains on all the major lifts by having pre-strengthened stabilizers.

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?**

I've had two annoying injuries in the past year. The first came from skiiing: where I twisted my right ankle. This made placing much weight on it difficult, and it took a month to recover, while I trained lighter (10%) around it. What I learned from this is that skiing is like heroin. You go right ahead and enjoy yourself, you know the risks, idiot.

The second I have now: My right forearm muscle -- not tendon -- pains when I grip when it is extended. I'm confident I got this from over-pulling a deadlift. I have rested it 3 weeks (almost certainly too much, but it coincided with two weeks of extended travel for me, which made it timed well), but it hasn't recovered. I'm going back into the gym today, and it's going to have to suck it up, it's go time.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I had never, ever skiied in my life before the week I went skiing last December, and had the minor twist. I did my reading before on injury rates, knew what I was getting myself into, and am fairly sure that it was caused because my bindings were too tight, that the ski-shop guy didn't fully get that I was a ski novice. Lesson learned: skiing's fricking dangerous, don't trust anyone to set your bindings right: learn your numbers and tell them what they are. If you go at all.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?**

I don't have any favorite fitness books, DVDs. My favorite website is exrx.net, where a lot of very basic exercise information is available, which is perfect for the novice. My favorite sport, for me to participate in, is running, alone. I don't have any favorite competitive sports, because I don't really know how to moderate competition: I either want to destroy and humiliate the competition, or, if I lose, I simply hate myself -- unless I can convince myself not to care at all about the outcome, which pisses off my competition, because it's obvious I'm not trying.

**Anything else you want to add?**

Yeah. I'm pretty much guaranteed to be the biggest novice/n00b you ever see in this spotlight. And if you've read this far, I'm amazed -- because I know from reading much else here that I have almost nothing to teach any of you about weightlifting, or fitness.
However, I'm a lot older than most of you, and so I may have something to teach you about life, which can be applied to how you practice fitness: Be kind. Live happily.

It doesn't have to be necessarily backed up by science, but I wanted to put together a list that people can look at that can hopefully give them a few tips and maybe learn some new things to try out. I'll go first (some of these are not original):

- Coffee before working out is probably the best thing ever

- If you don't have the mobility to back squat properly, try doing a couple of sets of front squats before going on to the back squats. It'll free up the hips and activate the abs, letting you back squat much more safely.

- Doing a couple of high tuck jumps before going for a heavy squat or deadlift will make the lift seem a lot easier. This is not to be confused with complex training, which is doing a set of squats and then supersetting with jumping.

- As much as you can, warmup on a thick bar. Heck, even workout on a thick bar as much as you can. When you lift with a regular bar it'll seem like child's play.

- Crushing the bar immediately makes you stronger. Try it, when benching, crush the BB or DB like it owes you money. You'll find that you can lift a lot easier. This is why grip training is important.

- Towel pullups are the shit. Enough said.

- The lift that I see most people mess up on is the clean. If you have ANY doubt about whether you're doing it right, stop doing them until you perfect it with a broomstick. Or stick to the snatch, you can't really cheat on it or you'll kill yourself.

- The best ab exercise (aside from gymnastic progressions) is the front squat. You won't be asking for any upper or lower ab exercises when you can front squat 300lbs.

- If you have stalled on your deadlift or squat, try toying with your foot placement. If you're a taller guy or are stronger in the glutes than the quads, you'll find that a wider foot placement will feel more natural and stronger.

- If you think you are stable, do a set of heavy front squats, bring your arms out in front of you while still having the bar racked on your deltoids and take a couple of steps. It's harder than it sounds.

I got some good answers and now I have a further question. Basically my HIIT is some sort of kettlebell workout. A high rep set followed by a short rest period and repeat. The eventual goal is to actually eliminate the rest period and be able to do 10-15 mins of continuous reps, depending on the exercise and weight of the bell.

Should I accomplish this (10 mins continuous reps), is this basically a very hard aerobic workout and/or is it comparable to running several sprints in terms of visceral fat loss and taxation of the body? 

Are there still any anaerobic benefits?

This I felt didn't do them justice. I decided to make some videos to demonstrate just how fucking hard they make an exercise. 

[90lbs Kroc Row with Fat Gripz added.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFziODBvsI) This was my first set of rows for the workout. My grip was fresh and I assure you I gave it my all. The last rep I was essentially holding on with my index and middle finger and my thumb was giving out as well. I just decided to set it down instead of have it rip out of my hand. 

[90lbs Kroc Row no Fat Gripz.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a0QSARUjVk) As you can see this was pretty easy and there is no comparison in terms of difficulty. 

If your grip sucks, or if your gym's dumbbells are no longer heavy enough, I cannot urge you enough to purchase these. They have helped me tremendously. I use them for pressing movements as well and they have helped with some shoulder discomfort I was having. (Although I'm not exactly sure why or if it wasn't just the Fat Gripz alone; I cannot ""prove"" them as the sole reason for shoulder health improvement.) 

I hope this helps demonstrate the difficulty Fat Gripz can add to your workouts. If you do choose to make this purchase my one bit of advice is to limit the use of these at first as grip strength seems to take a bit more time to recover than usual.

I know there are other grip tools on the market but I don't own those and cannot testify to their effectiveness but I am sure they're just as good or close to.

**Stats?** 22, Male, 5'6, 74kg/165lbs

&amp;nbsp;

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

At the moment, just lifting things up and putting them down, and I have yet to compete (although I'd like to)

&amp;nbsp;

**What's your story?** 

There's not too much to say on this, so I'll try to keep it short 

 * From the age of about 11 to 16 I trained in Tae Kwon Do (Blue belt, Red tag)     
 * About the same time I was playing Hockey at a fairly low level. I was never that good at anything other than hitting the ball hard.     
 * From 14 to 19 I was obsessed with mountain biking. I've competed in one 4X race, and decided that I'm not a racer. The best trick I ever learnt was a barspin, the biggest drop I ever landed on my hardtail was ~15ft, but for the most part I wasn't very good at landing things.    
 * Went to uni at 18, and lived with Bro No.1, who taught me to bench press, and that was all we ever did when we worked out. For the second and third years I lived with Bro No.2, who also curled. I got bored of this, found *bodybuilding.com/exercise*, and would use the 1' York weight set to do things I found in there. Then about a year and a half ago I found Fittit, and started learning more about what I was doing and why.    
 * Started running 5 - 10km most evenings for a few months, initially to see if I could, but then because I got fit enough that I could actually enjoy it.   
 * Then I torrented Convict Conditioning, and started mixing calisthenics into my homemade routine.   
 * At the start of this year I finally bought myself a proper set of weights, made myself a rack and bench, and started lifting properly.

&amp;nbsp;

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

Lift numbers as of the last time I tested:   
**Deadlift** - 185kg/410lbs   
**Squat** - 140kg/310lbs   
**Front Squat** - 100kg/220lbs   
**Overhead Squat** - 75kg/165lbs [Bodyweight!]   
**Weighted Pistol** - 40kg/90lbs   
**Bench** - 95kg/210lbs   
**OHP** - 67.5kg/150lbs   
**Clean** - 87.5kg/190lbs   
**Snatch** - 62.5kg/135lbs   
**[Yoth-Sarcasmo Press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6bjEmmkLk)** - 20kg/45lbs  
**Weighted Pull-Ups** - 40kg/90lbs    
**Weighted Dip** - 45kg/100lbs

And because there was a challenge for it on Fitocracy, I tested my 1 mile time, and can run it in 6.23. This is after not having run in a year, so I'm fairly happy with that.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

I probably overestimate my ability to do so, but I tend to make it up as I go along. Occasionally I stick to predetermined numbers (Smolov, Smolov Jr, and 5/3/1 for the main lifts) but most of the time I just go and lift progressively heavier things until I can't anymore. I've only recently got far enough out of my noob gains that it doesn't work as a training method, although I'm not saying it's a good one.

My current plan is outlined in my BTFC post, but it's basically a test to see what happens if I do this for a month:

I'm currently trying to overtrain by doing heavy triples/doubles/singles on all lifts, very regularly.

 * **Day A:** Squats, Bench, OHP, Deadlifts, Accessory work   
 * **Day B:** Oly lifts, Deadlifts, Squats, Accessory work

Working up in roughly 5-10% 1RM increments, from 55% to 95%, then dropping down and going to failure.

There are a few short term targets I have in my mind: 1000lb club (930ish at the moment), 2 plate clean, BW snatch.

&amp;nbsp;

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Diet is currently an 16:8 Intermittent Fast Bulk. I love cooking and love eating even more, so I don't have that much difficulty eating enough. 

I'm a bit of a supplement whore, and I'm up for trying anything once. This is what I currently take:

**General**: Fish Oil, Multi, Vitamin D     
**Fasting**: ECA Stack, BCAAs      
**Preworkout**: [Homemade Stack](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/ii20z/homemade_preworkout_supplement_just_want_to_run/) - It only contains the basics for now (5000mg Creatine, 5000mg Beta-Alanine, 300mg Caffeine, 1000mg Choline/DMAE mix, 1000mg Taurine, 1000mg Inositol/Milk Thistle Extract mix) but I might add DMAA/Citrulline/ALCAR/Cocaine       
**Postworkout**: Whey/Casein, Some more Fish Oil

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I'm incredibly stubborn. For the most part, if I decide I'm doing something, I will. I entered the [Tough Guy Challenge](http://www.toughguy.co.uk/What_Is_ToughGuy.php) as a skinny 16 year old, and made it to the final ice lake (event is at the end of January, and we were breaking the ice to do some of the water obstacles), before I got pulled out because I looked like I had hypothermia. I didn't, although I was quite glad I didn't have to swim the lake, because I'd have tried. I found out afterwards that even though it looked like there was a reasonable distance to the end, there were actually only a few more easy obstacles after the lake. At some point, I'm probably going to have to go back and actually finish it.

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

For the most part, everyone is supportive or they don't seem to care. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I'll listen to anything. If it makes no sense, and the person giving the advice either can't justify it or I don't trust their anecdotal evidence, I'll ignore it. The world would be a much better place if people questioned things more, especially their own beliefs. I've believed some real brosciency things in the past, because the guy that told me was ripped or because the website it was on was well designed, and I'm a little embarrassed how long it took me to check for myself.

Having said that, there are a bunch of people in here who've been incredibly helpful over the last year and a bit, and I value advice from a lot of you more than just about everyone else dispensing it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

I decide the worth of a supplement using something similar to Pascal's Wager. I look at cost, potential benefit and potential harm. Vitamin D3 and multivitamins are good examples of something with a low cost and no real risk, so if you feel you *might* be deficient, it makes more sense to wager that you do.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do?** 

The Yoth-Sarcasmo Press. That was the result of TeamYoth laughing at my daft exercises (I think the one in question was a One Handed Snatch to One Arm Overhead Pistol), but making up exercise is half the fun. I'm determined to do a One Legged Sissy Squat, just because I'm not sure anyone ever has.

&amp;nbsp;

**What injuries have you dealt with?** 

Very few. Most are fleeting results of my stupidity. The only ongoing issue I have is with my left shoulder, and that's no problem so long as I do a few light sets first to warm it up.

&amp;nbsp;

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

The various fitness subreddits, AARR, Lyle McD, JC Deen, Fitocracy, and occasionally T-Nipple have some good articles.

**Age? Sex?** 19, Male 

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in? 
Do you compete at any level?** 

I wrestled (130 and 140lbs class) and rowed in high school and I currently play lacrosse (mostly LSM) at the club level at my university. We played about 15 teams in the last year in the Northwest US and will play more next year, aiming for a National bid. 

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into your chosen sport or fitness plan?** 

My dad bought me a second-hand bench and weights in 8th grade and I began doing whatever 3 sets of 10 that everyone does to start. I didn’t really get in to training until I was started wrestling at age 16 and even then I was, at best, misguided with workouts consisting of bench, biceps, and maybe some shoulder press. In my senior year I stumbled upon “Chaos and Pain” (CNP) and threw myself at that for my last rowing season. I am now a kinesiology major and plan to make strength and conditioning training my profession. 


**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

My last rowing season was my most successful, placing 2nd in the lightweight (155lbs) single and 2nd in the 2V double in the Junior Regionals. Once I get the basic skills of lacrosse down a little better I hope to have a few successes in that department as well, but for now it has been about the weights. 

**What is your workout or training regimen?** 

During lacrosse season (February to May/June) I run Defranco’s WS4SB as maintenance. 

Once the off-season begins I get back to CNP and I am currently doing this: 

 * MON: Upper Push and Pull (15 sets of 1, 10x3, 8x5, 5x8) followed by a strongman finisher. 
 * TUE: Squat (same reps or [The Ironman](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/f2kce/tired_of_3x10_squat_workouts_try_this_one/) ) followed by GHR, abs, and back. 
 * WED: Upper body, higher reps, whatever I feel like (CURLZZZ).
 * THUR: Squat or Deadlift (same reps) followed by GHR, abs, and neck work. 
 * FRI: Upper Push and Pull (same reps) followed by a strongman finisher. 
 * SAT or SUN: Hill Sprints, sled work, lacrosse training 

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

Diet is carb-backloading and dairy-free, aiming for around 4000-5000 calories per day. When rowing lightweight I did all Paleo (2 cheat meals) and no dairy is just left over from that, I don’t miss it. During lacrosse season I transition toward more of a see-food diet while keeping fairly “clean” (no junk/fast food). I’m currently on somewhat of a post-season clean bulk (just aiming to regain lost weight) and once I hit my goal I will probably jump on the IF train if my summer schedule allows just so I see what that’s all about and cut down to my usual 10-ish% bodyfat. 

As far as supplements go, I keep it pretty basic. Whey concentrate, dextrose/waxy maize, creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, fish oil, ZMA, calcium, vitamin D, and caffeine. 

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, weights, heights, etc)?** 

My best on-water 2k in a single was (I believe) 8:21. Not phenomenal, but enough for a regional 2nd. 

February 2010 (start of real training): 

 * Bench/Squat/Deadlift = 225/205/275 

June 2011 (current @BW 165): 

 * Bench/Squat/Deadlift = 250/330/405 

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy?** 

If you feel like doing another set, do it. My sets are really just a goal, if I get more or less I don’t stress it. After rowing and almost two years of weightlifting I’m pretty in-tune with how hard I can push myself, so I generally just go as hard as I can while eating, sleeping, and pre/re-habing for 6-12 weeks then I take 1 week as a deload and go back to it. I have found that training heavy works better for me, so I rarely go higher than 8 reps. 

**What challenges do you face?** 

Almost none. I’m a healthy college-age male living alone and off-campus. My lifestyle is what I want it to be and other people rarely negatively influence me. My biggest “injury” is a snapping hip that I developed from rowing, but ice, foam/lax ball rolling, and stretching keep this in check. This is not really a challenge that directly affects me, but discrediting and re-educating my teammates is a huge obstacle in our team function. A lot of the guys are from old-school coaches who watched Rocky a few too many times and had their guys doing 5-mile runs and 3 hour conditioning sessions. It is surprisingly difficult for me to explain why this and myriad other exercises (as for examples) are not effective training strategies for a sprint-rest sport, but I’m starting to get through. 

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

I think accomplishment leads to more accomplishment. The more I get into this the more I love it, and I’m taking my intensity to the next level by training with the strongman club at my school over summer. I recently achieved my goal of hitting the strength standards of the Big 3 and my current goal is a 170lb bodyweight and over 1000lb total by fall. Being around other people who are stronger than me helps a lot to give me a goal…it’s way too easy to be satisfied with yourself and get comfortable. I train in the athlete’s gym here so there’s pretty much always someone squatting/deadlifting +400 who I can try to work toward. This is one reason why I don’t read /fitness—I don’t want to be the type of person satisfied/overjoyed by a 165lb deadlift PR unless I am a 12 year old girl riddled with AIDS. I have also been able to start training about a dozen guys from my team, most of whom had never lifted before, and seeing their progress and growing enthusiasm is hugely motivational. We tested today and many of them turned what used to be 3RM’s into 10-rep sets. I can’t wait to watch them get stronger in the next 7 months and then roll over people when our season starts up again in February. 

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers**? 

Again, living alone is a wonderful thing. The biggest lifestyle clash is just being at college, where alcoholism is referred to as “partying.” I drink about once a month, not on my friend’s birthday on Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo on Thursday, the neon party on Friday, and the house party on Saturday because I’m an adult and have school, a job, and goals. This is seemingly impossible for most of my peers to believe. 

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I listen to most advice from people I deem as or more credible/experienced than I, but I don’t accept it until I try it myself or do more research. Since I’m a kinesiology major and as this has been my hobby for a few years, I know enough to be able to discredit a lot of the advice I receive based on experience and prior knowledge, so this is a more efficient process than it might seem. 

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

Long-distance exercise is, at best, useless and at worst detrimental for everyone except long-distance athletes. This is especially controversial in sports, as everyone who has seen Rocky or Chariots of Fire wants to go out for a 10 mile death run in the name of team building or “mental conditioning” and anyone who disagrees is a pussy. This ties into my problem with Crossfit…just because something hurts doesn’t mean it’s good for you. Sure, 5 sets of 23 deadlifts at 56% of your max is hard and painful, but so is a naked army crawl over Lego pieces. “But Crossfit/all those sprints/erging 500’s made me throw up so I must have been working hard!” It’s easier to recover from a night of drinking vodka/gin/whiskey than beer. Like the others, this could be proven and might already have been, I just don’t know it. 

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I am the only person on my team who trains hill sprints more than flat sprints. I believe that the greater loading of the muscles, naturally enforced sprint form, and positive shin angle makes them superior to training with flat sprints (as long as you aren’t a track athlete, if you are, you should be working on flat form). Also, I am one of two people who train the neck, the other being my lifting partner. I believe that having a strong neck reduces your overall injury risk, especially with concussions. I also love the shit out of the Behind the Neck Push Press and have never seen anyone other than my training partner attempt it. My current 1RM is 215. The Ironman Squat Pyramid is another workout I picked up from Lewis and normally gets a few questions when I do it. Monkey Chins are another CNP influence, although I currently lack the facility to be able to do them. My buddy and I used to frighten the old people at the YMCA with [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaieUDOPnbY).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

Fall of my senior year I was being recruited by a couple universities for rowing and, in order to achieve their standards, was training somewhere around 12-14 times a week for about 6 weeks. This pretty quickly led to overworking and the “hip snapping” that I currently deal with. I tore my meniscus in a non-training-related setting 5 years ago, but PT and stretching takes care of that. I get better at realizing when I’m approaching injury or staleness as I get more experienced and that helps me avoid setbacks. There are a variety of physical risks from lacrosse, from concussions to broken bones and shin splints. As a defenseman, I am responsible for administering most of these and am not worried about getting hurt. 

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

See a physical therapist BEFORE it’s an injury. This means recognizing signs of a problem and putting your ego behind you and realizing that more ART/SMR is not going to make it better. 

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

Gotta plug Chaos and Pain here. Macho posturing aside, Lewis helped me out when I was starting out so I’m appreciative for that. I read T-Nation for ideas while being ever aware of the mass amount of marketing in everything they do. “Maxcondition” by Jamie Hale is a pretty good book and I have a bunch of lacrosse books too if anyone is interested.

That is the question.,24,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/h6s90/to_backload_or_to_frontload_that_is_the_question/,"This has been one of those fitness grey areas for a while for me and I wanted to pick the collective brain of AF. I've read equal arguments for both carb backloading and frontloading, summed up below as I understand them. ""Carbs"" refer to refined and/or high-glycemic carbohydrates, not leafy green veggies or other high-fiber/vegetable foods.


My background may be helpful here. I'm a weightlifter and lacrosse-player in college, 165 lbs and 10-12% bodyfat. I am not a bodybuilder and have no need to go below about 10% bodyfat, although I was as low as 8% when I rowed and did Paleo/keto during a 6 month period about a year ago. I am a kinesiology major and training has been my hobby for about 4 years, so I have a decent base of knowledge. **Edit:** I'm currently in off-season training, trying to walk into next season (february 2012) at at least 175 pounds and about 10% bodyfat. My training is solid, so I'm really just looking for diet help/clearing-up.


**Backloading:** Falls in line with the IF/Cheatmoders. Morning catabolism is beneficial for fat-loss and muscle-loss is negligible. You don't need quick energy until close to training. Eat few to no carbs before training---for example, on training days: paleo for the first 1-3 meals, protein shake pre-wo, carbs post-wo for 2-4 meals. This helps insulin sensitivity by restricting carbs until you ""need"" them post/intra-wo, at which time all of the ""quick energy"" will go to repairing and building muscle and re-upping muscle glycogen depleted from the workout. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/h6s90/to_backload_or_to_frontload_that_is_the_question/c1t34va) are some backloading sources.


**Frontloading:** Shelby Starnes and Jason Ferruggia are my main sources here. Morning catabolism, while it is somewhat good for fatloss, is detrimental to muscle mass and should be avoided. On training days, eat low-glycemic (read: whole grains) carbs for the first 2-3 meals of the day. Post-wo, consume high-glycemic carb for insulin spike, then eat few to no carbs for the remaining half of the day. On non-training days, eat carbs for the first 1-2 meals, then go paleo. This provides a base store of glycogen and ""quick energy"" for muscles to draw on during lifting and then restricts carbs post-wo because you don't need ""quick energy"" before a +20 hour period of inactivity (afternoon, evening, sleep, next morning before training). This helps insulin sensitivity by re-upping muscle glycogen depleted during sleep and then providing ""quick energy"" before you ""need"" it and then restricting it after.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_h6s90,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/h6s90/to_backload_or_to_frontload_that_is_the_question/,
1299956325.0,22,self.AdvancedFitness,g2p5k,Initial Thoughts and Program Review: Wendler's 5/3/1 with Boring But Big accessory work,28,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/g2p5k/initial_thoughts_and_program_review_wendlers_531/,"Most of you guys are aware of Wendler's 5/3/1, but I just wanted to throw out my initial review and perception of the BBB. 

A quick overview:

* BBB is do the main exercise for that day with the accessory work also being more of the same main exercise.
* 5/3/1 week warmup and work sets
* Then 5x10 sets of 40-60% 1RM, or you can ladder down if you want, but 5 more sets of the same.
* I chose 5x10 of ~40-50% 1RM

I've done it only for my last cycle because I was scared of the volume making me too big. I'm already 215-220 lbs and I blow up like a balloon with volume (because I eat too much usually).

My initial goal in the last cycle was to do it only for the '5' week and then do the Triumvirate in the '3' week, then get ready for the '1' week, all-balls-out attempts. My thought was because the '5' week is not so bad, let's mix it up a little and also because I was doing caloric restriction of about 2000 cals per day and IFing as well, that maybe I wouldn't have to worry about bulk that week.

What I found is that:

* It's fucking brainless and I enjoy that.
* It's great for people with limited time such as me.
* BBB is tough and tiring. I have good endurance, but this was a bit of an eye opener. For the first time in a long while, I felt really spent. Let me emphasize this: *I do not half ass it usually and this kicked my ass even more*
Examples include having to alternate grip the last set of my 185lb DLs because of grip failure (For comparision, I can DOH 300lbs) and wondering if I could complete my last two sets of 135 lb squats.
* I use the last 5 sets to work on some of the endurance and conditioning, because I rest for only 60 secs between sets except the DLs (120 secs) starting from the last work set.
* After the first week of completing all four lifts, I was hooked. Forget the Triumvirate, I'm going to do this again!
* With the caloric restriction and IF, even in just the first two weeks, I noticed changes in definition and I wasn't necessarily getting bigger as I was also losing just a little bit of weight.
* Lifts were still going up.
* I would have a piece or two of pizza after DLs or Squats day with no effect on weight or definition. (Still focussing on staying below 1100 cals before going home from work)
* Whether you're looking to build mass or cut fat, I think it this works, whatever your goals are depends basically on your diet. Obviously, bulking is much easier...

So, with all that said, I'm going to continue with the BBB for the foreseeable future as long as I maintain my caloric restriction and do a few other, basic accessory exercises (dips, pullups, butt work, rows, conditioning).

Many, many times I read an article by advanced guys, they mention how everything in their bodies was great until the day they exploded 6 vertebrae doing some very heavy weights and had to have them all fused back together with adamantium (hyperbole for effect). I see it often enough to wonder if all 'advanced' guys have this problem at one point or another in their life and question, ""Is it worth the risk?"" Especially as I approach 40 (later this year).

Say I cap my main three lifts (bench, squat, deadlift) at 315lb each 'for safety' and periodize around this max while doing all the other proper accessory work. That's still pretty damn strong.

Am I doing a disservice to my body in that after a while there may be imbalances that I can't make up doing other accessory work? 

When you fuck up a 100lb lift there is hardly any recourse, 200lb is a bit more serious but still not bad. In my opinion things change quite a bit after 250lbs and joint stress and other factors climb exponentially as you add weight.  Fucking up at those weights is bad news, so why go for diminishing returns after 315lbs?  Not many people need that kind of strength outside the gym and the risk just gets higher and higher.

So, I've had my say (and I'm not saying I've decided this is what I'm going to do). What is your perceived optimal point beyond which the law of diminishing returns kicks in or do you even think one exists? Am I smoking crack? Making sense?

A [few pictures](http://imgur.com/a/YgWVQ) of me mostly rowing, one randome one of me putting my wheels on, and one of my new CF steed: the trek speed concept 2.5 ☺

**Age:** 23

**Sex**: Male

**Sports:** 

Rowing/Triathlon; I competed at the collegiate (D3) level in rowing, and now after graduating have moved on to triathlons.

**My story:**

I started rowing as a freshman in highschool (my parents forced me to try it) and ended up absolutely loving it. Rowing was the first endurance sport that I had tried that I was able to compete in, I am naturally pretty big boned and somewhat muscular so have never been a stand out runner. I rowed for all four years in high school and was recruited to row in college (I couldn’t get get recruited to a D1 school because of my height). I had an absolutely amazing time rowing in college, and made some of my best friends through the rowing team. Highlights included breaking the freshman 6k school record, being in 1st place for ¾ of our championship race my junior year of college until our 7 seat passed out, and a trip to the royal Henley Regatta in England. Rowing taught me mental toughness, and I stand by the statement that no man really knows himself until he stares himself down at the 1500 meter mark of a 2k erg test. After graduating, I have moved onto triathlons as a way to stay in shape, stay motivated and keep pushing myself. I completed my first triathlon (a half ironman: 1.2mile swim, 56 mile bike, 13.1 mile run) 4 months after graduating from college and am hooked. 

**Current Goals:** 

I’m shooting for a top finish at my next half-iroman. Reasonably, I think I can go around 4:55 and on an absolutely amazing day I might stand a chance to qualify for the world championships in Nevada (but this is a best case scenario). I am also training for a full distance ironman in september (2.4 mile swim, 112 bike, followed by a marathon) which I will feel happy to just complete but am aiming for a sub 11:30 time.

**Workout Regimen:** 

A typical week I average close to ~30 miles running, ~120 biking and 2 or 3 hours swimming, plus one or two 40 minute body weight lifting sessions. I usually stab for at the very least 8 hours of training a week and usually a good bit more than that. 85% of the cardio work I do is steady state cardio—but sometimes I like to push it into anerobic depending on how I’m feeling.

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

My diet is pretty poor. I try and eat healthy, but undoubtably have a few meals a week that are pretty shitty. I also drink once or twice a week—unfortunatly most social relationships for kids right out of college revolve around drinking. I know I could be significantly faster if I improved these two aspects of my personal life, but I feel like I need my demons to keep my sane and motivated to work hard. Oh well.

**What Have I achieved so far:** 

Some of my numbers include: a 6:21 2k erg (1:35.2 split/500 meters), I finished my first half ironman in just under 5:30 (~37 minutes / 1.2 mile swim, 20.1 mph for the 56 mile bike, and sub 9 minute miles for the 13.1 mile run), and a 3:38 marathon. When I used to lift for rowing here are some numbers I remember being able to do: 90 pushups, 22 pullups, 3 x 315x6 for squat, 3 x 185 x 15 bench. I have stopped lifting to train more for triathlon so aren’t very close to these number anymore. Also, for the record I am 5’10 ~185 lbs if you are trying to picture my bodytype.

**Competition and Training Philosophy:** 

My training philosophy is incredibly simple: listen to your body. I am very motivated so find that actually going and doing my workouts is never really an issue, I’m more worried about over training, and scheduling (sometimes I miss workouts do to having to do unexpected overtime hours at work). I try to keep my training varied to avoid overuse injuries, and I will always skip a workout if I feel too tired/sore/sluggish for a session to be productive—rest is super important! A typical day for me would be work from 8-5, and then work out from 6-8. On weekends I do more volume. Ideally I try to get 1 day of rest a week, although this sometimes changes depending how I feel and what my schedule is.

**What Challenges do I face:** 

Aside from having to work and put in some crazy hours to train, I’m really trying to lose weight so I can improve on my running—185 lbs is not the ideal weight for a runner! Also, teaching myself how to swim was pretty tough, but I think I’ve gotten proficient at it.

**How do you motivate yourself:** 

I feel like I am pretty self-motivated. I’m always thinking about how slow I am compared to other athletes (there will always be someone faster) and am constantly trying to close the gap. I also just love the feeling of satisfaction/accomplishment after a workout that I feel satisfied with (crashing on the couch after a 4 hour bike followed by a 10 mile run is amazing!).

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?**

I haven’t really had any naysayers, the hardest thing for me has been trying to maintain healthy social relationships while still putting in the hours towards training. If I have to get up early to do a workout or miss a happy hour or two I’m fine with that, likewise if I have to miss a workout to go visit some friends so be it. Life is about balance, and it’s not balanced if all I do is go to work and train.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore**: 

I don’t really take any advice. I know what it takes to get faster, I know what is good and bad for me, and I listen to my body. You can find a lot of shitty advice on the internet, from wacky diets to supplements, I try to just do what feels right.

**What are some training or diet-related things you know are true but cannot prove?** 

I’m really waiting for someone to prove that bacon cheeseburgers are good for you!

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training/diet that you've never seen others do? Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?** 

I avoid training plans like the plague. I know they work for a lot of people, but I like having the flexibility to do what I feel like on a given day. I also can’t seem to reconcile what happens if you miss a workout when you are trying to stick to a plan (shit happens, now is your entire workout plan flawed?).

**What injuries have you dealt with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors?** 

I had some pretty nasty shin splints for a few months (probably because I’m so fat), but I made a conscious effort to get bigger calfs and I think that has fixed the problem. One of the benefits to my “listen to my body/do what I feel like” approach is that if something doesn’t feel right, I don’t do it.

**Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?** 

Train smart and remember that rest is just as important as doing the work.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books/DVDs/websites?** 

/r/fitness duh! I also like [beginnertriathlete.com](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com). I also used youtube to watch videos on swimming technique when I was learning how to swim.

**Anything else you want to add?** 

Excuses kill you. Really. Anyone can come up with an excuse for every workout. Three reasons why you don’t feel good, what you ate, what you will eat, what you’ll do tomorrow, what you did yesterday, etc. Excuses are like assholes, everyones got one and they all stink.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_ho3oo,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ho3oo/member_spotlight_mast3rcylind3r/,
1295022918.0,22,self.AdvancedFitness,f2aip,Fucoxanthin: Unique fat loss agent,24,2,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f2aip/fucoxanthin_unique_fat_loss_agent/,"**Preface**

- Proprietary (secret?) Blend Xanthigen (Fuco + Pomegranite) has 2.4mg active fuco per 300mg. Can’t hide this shit from chemical analysis :D (This will be used as a standard for the rest of the review)

- This is long, and Fucoxanthin is a weird word to type. If you see my type ‘Fuco’, that is my short-hand. This never refers to fucoxanthin**ol** (To be discussed later)

- Molecular weight of fuco is 658.81g/mol, after my mathz it is 0.00065891mg/nanomol (more applicable to studies). Which means that **assuming 100% absorption and utilization** each nanomolecular increase in the blood is due to that much fuco, or better yet, 1mg fuco should increase the blood concentrations by 151.76 nanomoles if flawless (We’ll see later how the true value, just for simplicities sake, is a quarter of this; about 38 nmols/g)

- Fucoxanthin is fat soluble, so absorption is better if taken with fatty acids [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17992001). Studies routinely use such extracts, so this should not confound any studies in this review, just be aware it may be nice to take some fuco with your fish oil. (Irrelevant note, fuco appears to enhance [liver stores of DHA]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536824), a component of fish oil; seems irrespective of taking it alongside though) Fuco should also **not** be taken alongside compounds that hinder fat uptake, such as Green tea extract and insoluble fibers.

**Non-stimulatory fat loss pill**

Lots of compounds, such as caffeine and ephedrine, work in a multitude of ways. One of these ways is to either stimulate adrenaline production or activate adrenergic receptors (and mimic adrenaline). This is potent fat-burning potential, but may cause complications with susceptible individuals. Also, when making a ‘Fat-burning Stack’ one would be wise to not over-do the stimulation. Addition of non-stimulatory compounds to an advanced fat-burning stack can be considered a wise move for the final push.

Undaria pinnatifida is a plant containing fucoxanthin (it’s brown seaweed y’all), feeding mice this has shown to increase UCP1 ([Thermogenin]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenin)) activity in white adipose tissue [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896707). At least from a fat-burning perspective, this makes white fat act similar to brown fat. It has been noted in women [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840063) and mice [2]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19842104) for reducing fat stores and attenuating and [increase in fat stores]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845386).

The doses used in the study on humans (Why is this the only one? Hurry up Science, I want more!) used Xanthigen as outlined in the preface. This is a proprietary compound and is owned by a company although used by many. Life Extension foundation uses this exact blend in their fucoxanthin supplement and recommend around 5mg of active fuco a day (Which is double the proprietary dose, 3 doses of 200mg Undaria PInnatifida)

**Insulin sensitizing**

Possibly not directly, ‘Beneficial effects’ were noted meaning that it *should* lead to more insulin sensitivity given overfeeding. [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146577) Out of 4 groups, 1 control was ‘normal’ and 1 was ‘high fat’, both experimental groups were high fat, but one received ethanol extracted fuco and the other straight Undaria pinnatifida. It is in the opinion of this author (me) that the scientists were smoking rocks during this experiment, as the ‘High-fat’ diets were 20%. (17% lard, 3% corn oil; wtf guys?). These results have been replicated [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519145) [2]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845386), the latter study even found weight gain attenuated (although the first study did not).

**Metabolism and Safety; the Tl;Dr reference page**

Fucoxanthin is the parent compound, it breaks down into **Fucoxanthinol** and **Amarouciaxanthin A** predominately, with some breakdown into the cis-isomer of Amarouciaxanthin and two unknown compounds. ([Pretty picture]( http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/10/1824/F1.large.jpg) of metabolism of fuco, [Pretty picture]( http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/10/1824/F3.expansion.html) of relative levels of breakdown compounds) The first two are actually the active components, the former seems to be cardiac and the latter adipose, no fucoxanthin appears to be left after intestinal uptake [1]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19173766?dopt=Abstract). Knowing this is good for the following, although nothing bad will happen if you forget this in the future.  [1]( http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/32/2/205.abstract?ijkey=008bce16e93c265434823e47b00f455665e150ad&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) and [2]( http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/5/946.abstract?ijkey=c5b7d93360d54453fb8df719be60f29ead28aef8&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Fucoxanthinol is approximately 18-24% of fuco weight, Ama A is about 53-56%, and cis-Ama A is about 23-27%.

The latter study also indicates that intubation of 40 nanomols of fucoxanth**in** had plasma levels of fucoxanthin**ol** rise 10.4 +/- 5.3 nmol in 1 hour, indicative of about 26% relation of dietary intake to serum levels. Given how the previous study (and other in this review) found approximate weight of fucoxanthinol to be in the high teens -&gt; mid twenties (15-25%) relative to fuco, there is a strong argument that intestinal absorption of fuco is nearly perfect.

(Given how the above relations of intake to serum don’t leave any buffer room for other organ stores after 1 hour, it is possible that all goes to serum initially and the liver and other organs take excess with time; no evidence though)

Major metabolites were found to be keto-carotenoids, which have structures similar to carotenoids (plant derived Vitamin A) Accumulation of fuco and its half-life changed depending on where it was located. Liver had the highest initial despotion rates (7.51 nanomol/kg) with adipose in third (1.01-1.44nanomol/kg), half-life of fuco in the liver was less than 2.6 days whereas adipose was less than **41 days**. This gives some evidence that superloading fuco may be unnecessary (given long fat half-life) and potentially harmful (possible overloading of the liver).  Dose of this study was 0.128 +/- 0.016 nanomol/day and measurements were taken over a period of days. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739451)

Of course, that’s all applied, what does it mean to me?
Simple, it appears this stuff won’t harm you. Force feeding rats [1-2g/kg body weight]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19797858) showed no harm aside from difficulty in reading bilirubin levels. No toxicity noted in under 20 days of horrid abuse of fuco.

**Final notes: What do if not Biochemist?**

Fucoxanthin appears to be a great fat loss compound, it’s only drawbacks at the moment are lack of human studies (One linked, although I recall one other in Japanese Women that I cannot find at the moment). It makes a great addition to an advanced fat burning supplement protocol due to its non-stimulatory properties. Appears very safe in horribly overdosed rats, and no side-effects have yet been noted in human. 

Long half life and fat solubility, as well as evidence it is stored in your body for up to 41 days, means that it can passively burn fat at a slow rate at all times, for a long time; even while asleep.

My personal recommendations are to **not** buy this in stores, as it was raped by the media when it first came out and thus over-the-counter sale is very expensive. Life Extension foundation has the product I have experience with, and they sometimes do a sale where it drops to 14$ a bottle. Keep you eyes peeled on them or other online retailers.

I also personally believe it works well (despite the lack of applied evidence) as, since it works via UCP1, you can just *touch your fat and note heat production*. It has always been noticeable in the 3 cycles I have done with fuco.

**Edit1**

Should mention that, despite all the pretty math and numbers, all studies except the force-feeding one used approximately the same dosage of fucoxanthin for results.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_f2aip,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f2aip/fucoxanthin_unique_fat_loss_agent/,

Do you think it's plausible that one of the reasons people tend to build a lot of muscle after long cuts is that muscular nuclei are still built in response to training that occurred during caloric deficit, but the muscle is only able to increase in size after calories are increased?

To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any studies on this topic, I'm asking for speculation.

1370574639.0,21,self.AdvancedFitness,1fu7mc,Standing Calves before Seated Calves?,23,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1fu7mc/standing_calves_before_seated_calves/,"
So, the other day I attended a CEU seminar. During the seminar, we reviewed a number of leg exercises, and eventually discussed calve exercises. The instructor stated that it's proper to do a standing, or straight leg, calve exercise first, as it utilizes both the gastrocnemius and soleus calve muscles. Then, follow it up with a seated calve raise to utilize the soleus specifically. This has always been my approach to calves, but then I got to thinking. Due to the amount a slack the gastrocnemius undergoes in a seated calve exercise, it is generally considered uninvolved. In this case, it wouldn't suffer from trauma or tearing, wouldn't accumulate lactic acid, nor would it deplete energy substrates. If this is indeed accurate, would it really make a difference if the seated calves were done before standing calve exercises? And to take it a bit further, since standing calves exercise both the soleus and the gastrocnnemius muscles, would not performing the seated calve exercise first pre-exhaust the soleus to force the gastracnemius to endure a more strenuous and focused workout?

When I asked this question to the instructor, the only he offered was ""Standing before seated is how everyone does it, and they get pretty good results."" Having an exercise science background, I was hoping for more of an in-depth response. 

Sorry if that became a little unclear. That's probably the most I've ever crammed ""gastrocnemius"" and ""soleus"" in so few sentences. Anyway, I'd really appreciate some detailed input on this idea.

Can anyone in the hivemind think of a good way for me to replicate the Wrist Attachment piece of the pro device?,27,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/zkf6s/currently_trying_to_build_a_homeversion_of_the/,"So I'm sure most of you have seen the ""Better than steroids"" post that was all over everything fitness for the last week. (if not, find it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/duplicates/z3nf2/stanford_researchers_cooling_glove_better_than/) 

I saw the DIY plans online here: http://m.instructables.com/id/CoreControl-DIY/?ALLSTEPS and have decided to attempt build my own version of the device (albiet with some subtle differences)

One thing in particular that I am a bit stumped on is how I can replicate the action of the wrist-seal-control device. (See the pro-sumer version of this device here: http://www.avacore.com/buy-corecontrol) 

Notice in this video how he twists a dial to create the vacuum seal. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2yzItjfWyw

I think that's so much more elegant than struggling and tugging on a rubber glove that it's worth trying to figure out... but I have no idea what kind of hardware I could track down that will achieve that goal.

(Some form of sphincter or diaphram?)

Can anyone in the reddit hivemind come up with a good solution for that piece?

So far my idea is to place a few hot-cold gel packs (cooled to ~10c) in a 3.5L coleman thermos tub.
(**edit** this is the jug I'm using http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/Coolers/PRD~0854017P/Coleman+1+Gallon+Jug+with+Faucet.jsp?locale=en , gel packs inside, seal across the top (design pending), air pump strapped to the side)

A cut inner tube across the lid will be used to create an air-tight seal and a small battery powered air pump will create the vacuum. (eg: http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/AirPumps/PRDOVR~0760014P/Sidewinder+D+Cell+Air+Pump.jsp?locale=en) 

Replicating their wrist-action would be really nice.

Obviously I'm still kindof at the early brainstorming phases. Not sure if ignoring the water-pumping part of the equation is a good idea, but I can always go further since this particular method shouldn't really damage any part of the materials.  No drilling required!

[These were the results](http://i.imgur.com/Ybovg.png)

The trends are similar and apparent: you swim slower in longer races, and men are slightly faster. What's interesting is that the scaling exponent* is more negative for men: as the race gets longer, women catch up to men. However, according to the power laws fit from this data, the distance at which they're equal is about 450 kilometers.

I was interested by this trend so I went back to some old data I took from running records, where I recalled that the exponent was the same for men and women.

[Looking at the ratios of the speeds](http://i.imgur.com/dlt3Y.png) the trend, if present at all, is much weaker than for swimming. The spread of ratios covers the same range in the two sports, about 1.08 to 1.12

I'm not how to interpret this; my background is in physics not physiology. Why do these exponents have the value they do? Why is the gender difference only present in swimming? Is it important that the ratios and exponents are similar between the two sports?

I just thought I'd post this and hopefully get an interesting discussion. The next step, if one chooses to pursue this, is to tabulate records from other strokes and for both long and short courses, as well as to look at biking.

I posted it asking for suggestions as to what I could add. I got a flood of positive responses (which were very welcome) and a lot of upvotes (which made me wish it wasn't a self post) but contributions in terms of knowledge were few and far between. I did add a running section so there's that.

Hopefully people over here will be more aware of what's what.

The reason I only added 3 diet and 3 exercise suggestions to begin with is that I wish to supply good quality information. Here's what I consider good quality:

* Free (atleast to start with): I feel that in the age of the internet, you shouldn't have to pay to just learn what order to do exercises in and with what weights or rest periods or whatever. I've found a massive amount of legally free information that has helped me progress towards my goals, and while I'm not against linking to good quality paid content, I want to provide atleast one free link so that people can get started without having to lighten their wallets first.
* Reliable: The workout/program should have some foundation in reason, and should be tried and tested
* Relevant towards newcomers: As I mentioned, the picker is for people who're not sure what they're supposed to do. 

I personally have done SS, HIIT and 5/3/1, and so I know the effectiveness of those programs as far as building strength goes. I included some others based on FAQs and subreddits, but I'm not very familiar with the world of sport specific conditioning or bodybuilding.

So here are my questions:

* So far, I've not included a bodybuilding split because I feel beginners should focus on compound lifts and whole body workouts until they develop a reasonable baseline of strength. I think I should put in the intermediate section though. Do you have any recommendations?
* Do you have any recommendations in general as to sections/goals to add? Keep in mind that it's targeted towards someone who isn't likely to know what they're supposed to be doing, so leave the ""How to deadlift 1000 pounds"" out for now :P

[A Study on the Effectiveness of a Self-Fit Mandibular Repositioning Appliance on Increasing Human Strength and Endurance Capabilities
](http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/594/)

TL;DR:

&gt;The data indicate that a self-fit, intra-oral device is beneficial in improving grip strength values for both men and women at a confidence level of at least 95 percent. In addition, there is a 96 percent confidence level that a mandibular repositioning appliance is of greater assistance in grip strength tests than a placebo device. Therefore, the results of this research initiative demonstrate that statistically relevant human performance increases are possible by employing a self-fit, intra-oral device in active men and women of all ages.

[...]
&gt;Based on the results reported in Chapter V, it is concluded that:

&gt;1. Changes in jaw positioning while utilizing the EDGE device result in an improvement in grip strength for both men and women.

&gt;2.	The [EDGE](http://www.bitetech.com/wp/?page_id=98) device is statistically more beneficial than a placebo device for men and women combined.

&gt;3.	A ""placebo effect"" is evident for men. 

&gt;4.	A ''placebo effect"" is not evident for women. 

&gt;5.	There are some indications that the EDGE device may improve endurance.

[...]

&gt;Approximately 74% of the subjects with the EDGE device showed an increase in average grip strength as compared to testing without a device. Fifty-three percent of the participants who had a placebo device showed an increase in average grip strength values. The 'distribution of strength increases' while utilizing the EDGE device and the placebo device has been provided in Figures 21 and 22 respectively. The more than 20% difference in the number of people within a given population who showed an improvement in grip strength values while using the EDGE device versus the placebo device implies that the EDGE device is beneficial in enhancing strength. There also seems to be some gender-specific trends in the data.

Recently I have had to drop doing basic deadlifts every session since I was not advancing anymore; now I alternate between 1RM/volume/speed days for deadlifts and am thankful for it.

That being said, I was thinking about assistance exercises (for our purposes, exercises done after the main lift in an effort to increase the ability to do the main lift) and realized that all my past attempts at assistance have never increased strength at all on their own; just hypertrophy.

So, for those of you who can lift heavy ass weights;

- What do you do in the gym after your main lift?

- Is the exercise aimed towards where you fail on 1RM attempts, or is it more catered towards how that day went on the main exercise?

- Are these exercises done to fatigue? Explosively? High or low reps?

- In regards to cycling of exercises or methods (such as my deadlift example, or perhaps cycling back squats with box squats on a weekly basis, ex) any variations which you have had great success with?

Brett Contreras posted an article on the differences between traditional, power lifting and box squats [link](http://bretcontreras.com/traditional-squat-vs-powerlifting-squat-vs-box-squat/).

In Monthly Musings, the goal is to discuss evidence-based extrapolations or speculations. 

Sometimes theories just don’t have enough evidence to be fully fleshed out, or they may be better informed by studies or experiences in other subjects or systems that you know nothing about. And sometimes you have some anecdotal evidence that you’ve researched but still can’t explain.

However, I recently read about the potential benefits of post-workout fasting. Apparently, it takes time for growth hormone to spike after a workout, and if you eat too soon, you'll miss out on that increase. ([This article](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/1/96.abstract) suggests that growth hormone prevents muscle protein breakdown.)

Additionally, it takes time for protein synthesis to climb post-workout. Martin from LeanGains [wrote](http://www.leangains.com/2010/05/early-morning-fasted-training.html):

&gt; Though muscle protein synthesis is acutely stimulated post-workout in response to resistance training and protein intake, studies show some latency in regards to elevation and peak. Protein synthesis starts to climb about 3-4 hours post-workout, reaches a peak at the 24-hour-mark and returns close to baseline values 36 hours post-workout (or 48 hours depending on who you ask; studies on this topic show slightly different results regarding length and peak of elevation). Even if you push back the post-workout meal a few hours, you will be in the fed state at a time when nutrient partitioning is optimized and muscle growth likely to occur.

So, to maximize the benefit, would it be best to wait an additional hour or two after the workout? Thoughts and links appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_1bim3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1bim3r/how_soon_should_you_eat_postworkout/,

* **[5/3/1](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_to_build_pure_strength)** This was my first option with BBB for assistance. Looks great for strength and I know lots of people on it. It only works each body part 1x per week and from what I heard (might be broscience) this isn't optimal from the bulking perspective unless I have the testosterone of 20 men.

* **[Lyle's McDonald Generic Bulk](http://jcdfitness.com/2009/01/lyle-mcdonalds-bulking-routine/)** This routine foes on a different route with a upper-lower body split two times a week. I don't have know-how about the science behind it, but Lyle generally has some great insights.

* **[GVT](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_return_of_german_volume_training)** A classic hypertrophy program, although I don't like the ""no increase in strength"" that most people talk about it.

* **[Dan John's Mass Made Simple](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/mass_made_simple)** My last finding and the one I liked the most – the program is basically set like: 2 full body workouts per week that consist of Bench Press, One Arm OHP, DB Row Holds and high rep (+30) heavy weight squatting. The sheer amount of squatting makes me cry and love it, but I'm on a gym addiction and two times a week seems so low.

Anybody have experience (and/or science) to help me choose the best path or insights to modify or develop them? Volume work looks like a constant but besides that these 4 programs looks quite different.

Any opinion will be helpful, even if it's a ""just eat more and stick to SS"" if you have anything to backup.

First of all I'm a female about 162 pounds, 182cm tall and around 20-22% body fat. (Originally thought I was about 28% but electric scales lied to me and now I have to rethink my strategy)

I compete in a weight class sport and have to lose about 10 pounds over the next 5/6 weeks. Aiming for 152 pounds.

I currently do SL 5x5 three times pw and supplement it with cardio + core work. I am doing a small amount of muay thai and running 3-5 times a week as well but am not allowed to do as much at the moment because of injury. (It may be another 2 weeks before I can do this back to my usual standard)

Because of the injury I am doing a lot more strength training than I used to and a lot less cardio, hence weight gain, in both muscle and fat.

I estimate my BMR at 1600 and with general activity + gym 6 days pw closer to 2500.

I eat a predominantly Paleo diet, try to get 1g protein per pound of body weight, less than &lt;100g carbs and make up the rest in fat. So If I continue this method of eating and aim to eat 1500cal per day (-1000) in theory should I be successful in making this weight cut?

Making the weight is more important to me than keeping the muscle, I tend to build muscle quite easily (for a girl) and if anything its a bit too much at the moment, but as I am still at least 20% body fat in theory should be able to keep all the muscle and make weight? I am aware I can lose a few pounds on the day and have already planned in doing so but don't want to drop more than 4-5 pounds within 24 hours if I can avoid it. 

-should I dial back strength training and try up the cardio?

-does the diet look dialed in enough to make it work?

-any major flaws in my plan that you can see? or tips to increase success/make it easier.

-I often lack compliance, Should I consider fat burners/hunger suppressants? 

Sorry I threw a lot of information at you but I greatly appreciate anyone who took the time to read it and I welcome your feedback.

&gt; I had to do the last couple of OHPs with a little leg drive on the second set, as the overhead squats and hang cleans just wipe my arms out.

The progression on this complex is also a bit wonky as it does basically all arms first then all legs and the transitions are not smooth. So I wondered if that was by design?

* Tax your arms for the first half, then torch your legs to finish when you are already tired a bit.
* Makes the transitions not so smooth to add just that little bit of extra 'fuck you' touch to the workout.
* Replacing the OH Squat with regular back squat would take away from the complex because you need that overhead bit to add the arms getting tired.
* It's not just about doing lots of reps, it's about adding the things and the little touches that produce as much 'want to die' thoughts as possible.

I know svunt and silverhydra are fans of alternating arms then legs to take advantage of PHA training, but I would like know everyone's thoughts on the ideal way to compose one.

Alright, found a paper about asymmetric (left/right) use of rectus abdominis.

&gt; To our knowledge, tennis serve is the only tennis stroke where RA [*rectus abdominis*] activates asymmetrically

-- [Large Asymmetric Hypertrophy of Rectus Abdominis Muscle in Professional Tennis Players](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015858)

Of course, the same paper comments on upper (URA) and lower rectus abdominis (LRA) in passing:

&gt; The asymmetric hypertrophy of rectus abdominis in both the transverse and the longitudinal axis shows that tennis elicits differential muscle activity patterns between dominant and non-dominant sides and also between upper and lower regions of the rectus abdominis muscle. Recent studies support the neuromuscular independence between upper and lower rectus abdominis [30]. Our results concur with these findings, since a different pattern of adaptation between regions of the rectus abdominis can only be the result of a different pattern of recruitment. The fact that rectus abdominis is uniquely a trunk flexor, due to the vertical orientation of the fascicles [31], makes this finding specially interesting.

[30] [Neuromuscular independence of abdominal wall muscles as demonstrated by middle-eastern style dancers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329127) (paywall)

edit july 14

&gt; Among correct performers, CU [curl-up ] produces greater activity on upper RA. For persons who have a high level of activity, PT [posterior pelvic tilt] is more strenuous than CU on lower RA. Among incorrect performers, either exercise indistinctly activates the muscle portions.


http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8976314/

So there's two papers which say you *can* activate upper and lower abs. Now, on the other side:

&gt; There were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) between the EMG activity of the URA and LRA during any exercise.

This is a common test rowers perform and shows how much power a rower can produce in 3 strokes. For reference, here is an example: http://vimeo.com/9711375

I scored 858 Watts, or 858 Joules/second. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see how much I would have to deadlift to achieve that power output. Here is the method I used:

**Formulas**

Power = work/time

Work = force*distance

Force = (bodyweight + bar weight)*(gravitational acceleration)

Distance = (bar position at the end of the lift - bar position at the start of the lift)

Time = (time to lift the weight from floor to lockout)

**Constants**

Bodyweight = 78 kg

Gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s^2

Distance = 0.7366 m - 0.2032 m = 0.5334

Time = 2 s (I looked on youtube at a bunch of 1 RM attempts and this seemed to be the average)

**Results:**

Setting work to 858 Watts and solving for bar weight, we obtain:

Bar weight = 250 kg = 550 lbm

This is much greater than my 1 RM deadlift, which is 375 lbm. Lifting 375 lbm would produce 650 Watts.

**Thoughts:**

If one is able to produce such considerable power when rowing, what kind of effects might high intensity rowing have on strength development?

I do not know much about rowing. What, besides the obvious biomechanical difference, might make a 3 stroke max power output higher than that of a 1 RM deadlift? Perhaps the computer takes into the acceleration of the ""boat""?

&gt;Wouldn't it make more sense if doing 5/3/1 to do the heaviest set first, so one can do more reps with &gt;the heavy weight instead of starting it after being tired from the 2 previous sets?  
   
&gt;[Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j2kgj/a_few_questions_regarding_carbs_gaining_muscle/)  
  
  
  
Notable responses:  
  
* &gt; Nope. Those sets are there to properly warm up and get your CNS ready for a heavier weight. Follow it as written. - *zahrada*  
  
* &gt; Just do the program. If you want to outsmart people who've done it for decades, do your own program. Doing the lighter weights allows you to make sure you're warmed up first. Lifting heavy with cold muscles is a recipe for injury. - *fatmalcontent*  
  
* &gt; No. The idea is to work your muscles to exhaustion to allow maximum exertion, and thus, maximum growth. - *corduroyblack*  
  
----------------------  
  
The correct 5/3/1 schedule as per Wendler's book for wave 1 is:  
  
* Warm-up set 1: 40% x 5 reps  
* Warm-up set 2: 50% x 5 reps  
* Warm-up set 3: 60% x 5 reps
  
* Work set 1: 65% x 5 reps  
* Work set 2: 75% x 5 reps  
* Work set 3: 85% x 5 or more reps  
  
*Note: Only wave 1 (the “5” wave) shown. Work set load percentages change depending on the wave/week.*   
  
------------------------------------
Now, most of the responses to the newb's question were about warming up properly, but if one does the warm-up sets as Wendler instructs, why wouldn't it be beneficial to jump straight to the heaviest weight for the given wave? Isn't it “wasting effort” lifting the sub-max sets first?  
  
For example, why the above schedule and not: 40%, 50%, 60%, **85%**, 75%, 65%?

This seems to be a recurring theme in Thib's livespills as of late, making small modifications to exercises from set to set to 'activate the nervous system' more. (Put in brackets since I have no clue what the hell I am talking about when the CNS interacts with weight lifting).

I adopted this technique a while ago when he talked about foot placement on deadlifts changing a little bit between reps (when done in a cluster-set of singles); it worked beautifully and I was able to exert more workload overall before I hit that 'wall' during the workout where my strength went away. I've recently incorporated it into pin presses as well, but it is too soon to tell how it is working (although it feels great).

1300629720.0,18,self.AdvancedFitness,g7kno,Kelly Baggett on why cleans and snatches are not that great as a posterior chain strengthener,23,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/g7kno/kelly_baggett_on_why_cleans_and_snatches_are_not/,"A better title for this would be ""Why Cleans and snatches are not that special as a posterior chain strengthener, and you'd be better off doing other exercises rather than spend a lot of time learning technique""

from [here](http://www.empoweredathletes.com/interview-with-the-%E2%80%9Cmad-scientist%E2%80%9D-kelly-baggett/)

&gt; I don’t think there’s anything really special about the pull phase of the 0-lifts for the posterior chain and here’s why: From a standing position the muscles of the posterior chain are primarily designed to propel the athlete horizontally. In other words, when you’re standing up you’re fighting vertical forces and the gravity in an o-lift is pulling on the bar vertically. Thus, trying to optimally engage the posterior chaiin is difficult and requires a lot of technique…In other words, engaging the posterior chain from a standing position with a bar hanging from your hands is sorta like standing up vertically with a barbell and doing a horizontal bench press from that position and trying to engage the pecs. The resistance is coming from the wrong direction.

&gt; So, if you wanted a more physiological correct no brainer exercise for the posterior chain, put the body in position where the posterior chain has to naturally work against gravity. Figure out ways to load the posterior chain when you’re either on your stomach, on your back, or you’re using a device that requires you to work against horizontal force. Thus reverse hyperextensions, barbell hip thrusts (popularized by Brent Contreras), or sled towing/dragging/marches are better exercises for the posterior chain for the average trainee IMO. I’ve always been a big fan of reverse hypers and I thought the general indsutry movement to phase them out the last several years was a mistake.

&gt; Having said that, if you can do the O-lifts with correct engagement of the posterior chain they’re viable. That requires some technique though. There has to be some horizontal movement of the hips. The hips have to move back and explode forward. The Romanian deadlift is basically a slower o-lift. Done correctly it should target the glutes. However I’ve always thought it is the hardest exercise in existence to teach and do correctly. I pretty much gave up trying to teach it to my training clients. There has to be some emphasis on pushing the hips back and pawing back on the ground from that position (like a bull pawing the ground), even though the feet won’t move. The average trainee doing o-lifts and RDLs uses way too much back and not enough glute.

&gt; One good way I’ve found to get good posterior chain engagement with o-lifts is doing them from the hang in rhythmic fashion for fairly high reps (~8-10 or so). Some people call these speed cleans or speed snatches. I’ve always thought of them as “rhythm” cleans or “rhythm” snatches because in order to do them rapidly you have to use the correct muscle groups. If you don’t you lose your rhythm and the weight won’t go up. Kettlebell swings are also pretty good.

&gt; “Well if the muscles of the posterior chain are primarily designed to propel the athlete horizontally and the resistance in a squat is vertical doesn’t make the squat a useless exercise too?”

&gt; Well in the squat the hips have to go back and at the bottom the glutes get stretched. Therefore they have to contract to blast you out of the hole.

This was such a huge eye opener for me because I never realized that the hips were designed to propel the body horizontally. It makes such total sense now about why the hip snap is so important. I disagree about the RDL being the hardest to teach though, I find it pretty easy to teach. The only problem is that most people overdo the hamstring stretch and go into lumbar flexion. But anyway, I thought it was a really good read and Kelly Baggett is the man.

**edit: this was mostly for the people who do cleans or snatches in the hopes of improving explosiveness or posterior chain strength when there are a lot of other exercises out there that provide the same benefit without spending ages on learning technique. it's not a knock on olympic lifting at all. the title sucks but i can't change that now**",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_g7kno,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/g7kno/kelly_baggett_on_why_cleans_and_snatches_are_not/,

We all know starting strength, convict training, building the gymnasts body, and the Paleo solution; what are some others?

For me, this bloody awesome website ([KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)) is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes. If you put that (KEGG) into google along with a compound you find interesting, you may get a very informative chart.

For example, this is the result for [KEGG Insulin](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map04910), it may be whoosh to many, but I assure that at least one person just jizzed themselves.

Also, I absolutely love [The Manga guide to molecular biology](http://www.neatorama.com/2009/09/30/the-manga-guide-to-molecular-biology/), because it's a comic book and it's actually accurate. I linked enzyme man because he (alcohol dehydrogenase) is awesome.

Aside from those, 'the 150 healthiest foods' authored by Jonny Bowden is a good read (it actually names the beneficial compounds). And I love the anatomy coloring book since it teaches you and at the same time you get to color with crayons.

Things that would fall in this category include, but are not limited to:

- Things where there is absolutely no science on the matter for various reasons. (Ex. Whether there are fat loss/muscle benefits for working out at an intensity that rivals 'insanity'; no science since this cannot be attained in a controlled study all that easily)

- Things where there is one or two studies, not enough to be conclusive (Ex. Fucoxanthine, the compound I reviewed earlier, only has 2 human studies on it yet I truly believe in it's efficacy)

- Things where the science you have read doesn't seem like it can apply or is just plain awful. (Studies on raw egg bioavailability which are done on ileostomy patients with intestinal disorders)

I really want to see this thread get the advanced treatment, as the last one had a lot of ""I honesty believe that deadlifts are the best thing eeevvarrrr!"" comments, which may be true to someone, aren't as far-fetched or interesting as some others.

Weight: 185
Squat: 385, but haven't matched that number again quite yet. 370 is a number I can consistently hit
Bench: 195 (This is absolutely my worst lift)
Deadlift: 405 (It's definitely gone up, but I haven't tested it yet.

PL-wise, I have been lifting for approximately a year and started with SS.  I ran it for about 8 months, at which time I had the issue of several stalls and then went to Madcow.  I train approximately 5-8 hours a week on the bike and as such, have had trouble running Madcow effectively.

I am considering the following 5/3/1 template and riding template with hope to get suggesions/feedback on it.  I've also noted supplements I'm taking.  

My ultimate goal is to get an 1100 raw total while maintaining my bike speed, on flat land.  I don't give a damn about my body weight, just wanna keep my fat percentage sub 15.

Yohimbine HCL (Take it immediately upon rising and will typically lift thereafter, sometimes a very easy 40 or so minute ride)

Whey Protein (50g of protein taken 4 hours after the yohimbine, usually 25g post workout)

Homemade version of scivation x-tend sipped during fasted workouts

As the title says, no discernable changes in anything that I directly control. I am amateur athlete in kettlebell sport. The gist of the training sessions is kettlebell sets from 1-10 minutes, followed by various low weight/high rep work with a bar or a kettlebell, circuit training, then 20-60 minutes of moderate effort cycling or jogging.

2 weeks ago, mid kb set, my heart rate was much higher than is typical, breathing more labored and knees felt extremely fatigued almost immediately. I adjusted my eating a bit for the next session by increasing my carb intake, no help there. Tried beta alanine and citrulline mallate, generally reserved for the platform, no help from that either. Food and supplement intake has been back to normal the last week and a half with persistent, discernable fatigue.

Outside of training, I'm experiencing highly labored breathing from things that haven't caused issues forin 2 years: stairs, moving things, etc., heavy thumping of my heart, RHR consistently over 110, slight dizziness and general tiredness. As I said, training volume is no higher or lower than it should be, and actually this last week has been a 'reset' week between microcycles.

I'm going to the doc tomorrow, but I figured I'd pose the question here. Has anyone experienced something similar? If so, what do? I'm concerned it may be hypertension or low blood sugar. Fairly sure it's not over-exertion, but it might be. Any ideas?

[750lbs, 760lbs Bench Press and 804 attempt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAkz2MNrhqE)

He does a sort of bridge basically on the bench first. I tried this the other day on some close grip bench and already my shoulders felt much more locked in place and it was easier to lock shoulders first, then place the feet and lock them. Then yesterday in yoga, we did this:

[Yoga bridge with hands clasped under](http://anmolmehta.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kundalini-Yoga_poses/modified-wheel-pose/modified-bridge-yoga-pose.jpg)

The second she told us to clasp hands, I felt my shoulders really tighten up and dig into the mat. It was as if the clouds parted and a ray of light hit me in the head with an angels chorus. Then she told us to lift our toes and just dig the heels in and I used this opportunity to really bridge as high as I could get and really driver my shoulders into the mat as hard as I could and I felt like a rock.

I'm going to start trying this in the gym to see if the shoulder postion still works out ok after bringing arms out and up and there is no strain issues, but I was wondering if anyone of you guys have tried this similar approach and it's just something I'm rediscovering, or we're looking at a wacky new broscience approach to set-up?

Thank you all so much for your responses. I was away from my laptop and could not easily sift through everyone on my iPhone. I'm back! Within a few hours, if you have indicated you'd like to participate, you will receive a link to the survey as a PM, or if you haven't chosen a group I will be contacting you to chose one together. I sincerely appreciate your help and willingness to try something new (for those of you to which yoga *is* new) and I look forward to working with each of you.

If you are reading this for the first time, I am still looking for more volunteers. Feel free to PM me or add into the conversation on this thread. Thanks!

Old message starts here:
Hey all. I am a certified yoga instructor, and because of questions I often get from weight lifter clients and random strangers alike, I have decided to run an informal study. Basically, if the results of this study look promising, I will do a more in depth, controlled, study to see if I can quantify exactly what benefits yoga brings to weight lifters. I'm no longer interested in generic terms, such as ""increased general flexibility"" or ""relief of lower back pressure"" or ""more flexible hamstrings."" I want to know how long it takes, on average, for a noticeable difference, and what the ideal frequency and duration of practice should be for specific benefits. In the future, I'd like to do similar work with sports-specific athletes and their important tasks. If you are not a weight lifter, and are interested in future work, drop me a PM and I'll keep you posted.


**How long, how often, etc:**

8 week study

4 groups of yoga participants, 1 control group that only has to submit pictures and do NO yoga. Each yoga group with have a slight variation in practice, either the duration of each practice or the frequency of the yoga practices.

You can belong to any of the 5 groups, according to your own schedule. If I have enough participants in a specific group, I will close that group in an effort to find more participants in the others.

One group will have to add NO YOGA, but take the prescribed pictures.

One group will practice yoga for only 20 minutes per session, 3 days per week.

One group will practice yoga for 30 minutes, 3 days per week.

One group will practice yoga for one hour once per week.

One group will practice yoga for one hour twice per week.

**Who I'm looking for to participate:**

Individuals that weight lift (the standard lifts we always talk about) at least 3 times per week, and have been doing so for over 6 months.

Individuals willing to continue on the same lifting schedule for the next 8 weeks (not the same weight, just the same frequency, lift types, and intensity), while adding my prescribed yoga work.

Individuals willing to take 10 specific pictures at the start of the study, 4 weeks in, and 8 weeks (completion) in. The pictures will be of posture from 3 angles, a few yoga poses, and lifting form with just the bar at the bottom of a squat, a dead lift, and one more lift of the participants choice.

MEN AND WOMEN, all ages, all body types.

**How am I going to do this? What do you get?**

I will be recording my own yoga practices and/or using videos I approve of on the internet for the appropriate practice lengths depending on your category. I will use dropbox to deliver the videos, and you can play them on your desktop/laptop/internet capable TV to follow along. I ask that you do the prescribed yoga practices, because I am using specific poses to judge their effectiveness, as well as proper sequencing, etc.

You get a GREAT addition to your lifting program, and you will experience benefits. How major? How many? That's the point of this study, but I promise they are there! At a minimum your squat depth will improve and/or become easier. You will improve your balance. You will improve your overall flexibility. You will also get free assistance and videos from me to keep. I am available for any questions, assistance, and corrections on form on yoga throughout the study. If you can't afford a yoga studio or an in person teacher, this is the next best thing!

You will need a yoga mat and just enough clear space to practice on it, unless of course you are the control group just taking pictures and checking in.

To record any progress visually, the pictures will be taken at the start, 4 weeks in, and 8 weeks out. Besides the pictures, VERY short surveys will be taken after each practice, and slightly longer surveys at the start, 4 week, and 8 week marks. The surveys after your practice will take less than 3 minutes. The other 3 surveys will take less than 10 minutes. The biggest time investment on your part is the actual practicing you do, as well as the 10 pictures.

**To participate:**

I have a survey for you to fill out to record your height, weight, age, current lifting schedule and what lifts you do, as well as any additional workouts you do no matter how small (even walking the dog). It will detail what pictures I need and what you will have to do yoga wise. 

Once you fill out the survey, I will determine if you are a good candidate for the survey, and if so, ask for your pictures, link you to the proper drop box group according to your length and frequency of practice, and have at it!

***If you are interested or have ANY questions, feel free to ask them here or in a PM.***

Your personal information and pictures will be kept completely private. Only participants who give me permission to use their pictures will be seen by eyes other than mine. In the event that you do allow me to share the pictures, I can edit out your face if desired, and include or exclude your stats/name/etc based solely on what YOU feel comfortable with.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_ij8l8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ij8l8/looking_for_weight_lifters_to_participate_in_an/,

My list;

- When glute bridging (on the ground) I sometimes, just prior to the rep, take my feet off the group and then bash them into the ground. It helps with power accrual a ton and helps you get a heavy weight to the top of the motion to hold it for a count.

- Skullcrushers, I sometimes take my ass off the (flat) bench and drive my feet in the ground while flexing my ass/core; this makes the flat skullcrushers almost like a decline, and focuses more on the triceps.

- I have also found that rolling the bar I am about to deadlift forward and back, forward and back, while in a squatted position and letting it bring my shoulders forward as such, helps tremendously with the shoulder girdle and stability during the set.

I probably have more, but I'll add them later; let's hear some of yours.

I figure you guys might like to check this out - any input or advice is appreciated.

First thing's first, read this: [Complexes for Fat Loss (T-Nation warning)](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/complexes_for_fat_loss)

Objective: crank it HARD on fat loss for the next 4 weeks, and see where that takes me.  Trying not to lose much strength, but it's not the end of the world if I do - it's not the primary goal

Current Status: just ran WS4SB for 10 weeks, made some decent gains, but started to get pretty damn fatigued.  Deloaded last week, feel great now.  5'11"", 179 lbs, 13.56% BF (3 site caliper test - % not taken as gospel, but skinfolds will be measured weekly to assess progress)

The Plan: if you read the aforementioned article, you would know that this will be the core of my program.  I will be following the 4 complexes to a T, along with the suggested volume and rest time progression over the weeks.  I'm heeding the warnings of not adding too much additional work - I knew these would be brutal, confirming this after day 1.  Anywayzzz, the deetz:



Diet: &lt;50 carbs per day, save for one day on the weekends if I *really* feel like I need it.  Shoot for 200g+ protein.  Only drink once a week, max.



**Monday** 

45 minute fasted AM walk



**Tuesday** 

DB Bench Press - work up to one heavy but sub-max effort set

T-Bar Rows - work up to one heavy, sub-max effort set (opted for a support exercise to save the back for the onslaught to come)

*Complex A*

Stretching and mobility work with an upper body focus

Assistance work - arms (if energy / time permits)



**Wednesday**

Box Squat - work up...yeah you get it by now

Front Squat

*Complex B*

Stretching and mobility work with a lower body focus

Assistance work - abs



**Thurdsay**

45 minute fasted AM walk



**Friday**

Incline DB Bench Press

Pullups

*Complex C*

Stretch/Mobility upper

Arms



**Saturday**

Back Squat

Barbell Stepups

*Complex D*

Stretch/Mobility lower

Abs



**Sunday**

Flag Football league -OR- rest



Program Rationale: I'll only be doing two sets of heavy lifting before the complexes in an attempt to 1) keep strength up, 2) keep mass, 3) save energy for the death to come, and 4) have fun.

I'll be doing stretching and mobility work immediately after the complexes, as I'm crunched for time and prefer to multi-task - I'll catch my breath while foam rolling.

From what I've read, fasted AM cardio sounds like the best bet for fat loss if you'd like to keep it low impact.  HIIT in conjunction with this program would be suicide - seeing the AM walk as both active recovery and a boost to that program's goal

Anyway, just thought I'd do my part in the community and share my current methods.  Any thoughts, discussion, or suggestions are welcome.

---

So, I posted that on Monday.  Today is Saturday, and week 1 is complete.  Thoughts below:

* Fasted walks are great - even though they add two more days of early alarm clocks, I hit the office revved up and good to go.

* Complex A didn't go so bad.  Didn't heed the warnings well enough, though.  With only 85 lbs, I failed on the jump squats of the final set.  Still kicked my ass, though; I was pouring sweat for about 15 minutes straight afterwards.

* Complex B - I think I went too light.  Again, it kicked my ass, but I felt I could go heavier than 85.

* Complex C...whoa.  I remember reading an article a while back about kettlebells and how the hip-snap is one of the most metabolic movements - I believe it after this complex.  95 lbs, failed on the squat cleans in the final set.

* Complex D - Fuck.  This.  Noise.  Seriously.  Only one to leave me in ""holy shit"" mode after one set...at 75 freakin' pounds.  Immediately cut it to 65, but in set 2, there was absolutely no way i was doing the squat and hold for 5 reps - my hip flexors were so tired that I fell forward at about 8 seconds on #1.  Cut that exercise down to just one rep, and I was in so much pain that I couldn't do the squat and press in the final two sets.

So, lesson learned.  Complex A: 75 lbs.  Complex B: 95 lbs.  Complex C: 85 lbs.  Complex D: ...I have no freakin' clue.  Might just try it with the bar.  In the final weeks, I may need to cut out my strength sets before this one - it's just SO much volume.

I figure my conditioning will be better next week after the hell I put myself through here.  Goal is to not fail any sets.  Shit, at least I attempted everything this time.  Not a bad first week.

The first round of Front Crawl Drills is complete, and we've started Backstroke. After spending a month on each stroke, we'll start again with more drills for each. (I'm hoping to have someone different do each stroke for variety and different perspectives).

Let me just note here: Backstroke is the second necessary stroke for people doing Front-Crawl to protect the shoulders from damage. So as you are improving your Front-Crawl, you **must** start doing Back-Stroke.

For swimming, no matter your experience or skill you should always be doing drills. Swimming is difficult because it's such a technical skill sport. 

So here's a round up of the first four, &amp; I'm posting to the comment link because there is some necessary information there.

Apart from the first drill, the rest were chosen because I wanted to concentrate on some different aspects of the stroke so people wouldn't get bored or frustrated.

1. [Drill 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/eozp0/because_it_was_suggested_as_an_ongoing_topicfirst/) is actually a bunch of different rotation drills.

[This animation](http://www.swimsmooth.com/rotation.html) shows very well the ideal rotation and head positioning.

2. [Drill 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/ewlq1/drill_of_the_week_front_crawl_fingertip_drag/) is Fingertip Drag. Simplest of all drills and one of the oldest and most effective. Use it as much as you can during ordinary swimming, until you can switch it on and off with no effort.

3. [Drill 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/f0u16/drill_of_the_week_3_frontcrawl_fist_drill/) is Fist Drill, more of an intermediate level drill &amp; difficult to get right but well worth the effort, and therefore I think useful to introduce to people early on. 

4. [Drill 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/f5aba/drill_of_the_week_front_crawl_stroke_counting/) is Stroke Counting &amp; is aimed at those looking to improve a stroke in swimming recreationally, or do triathlons or long distance.  Two national level swimmers I know had never done this drill (which I was amazed at) and are really finding a benefit from it. Like Fingertip Drill, this one can be integrated into normal swimming.

Let me finish with this point:
When asked how to improve a stroke, the initial advice is always the same. **You MUST have stroke analysis**. 

Someone who knows must see you stroke so you know what to focus on. You CANNOT do this by yourself. You do not have sufficient feedback to be able to determine stroke problems. Many pools will have a master's Club, who will welcome most levels. Most pools will have *someone* who can look at your stroke for a few minutes and give you great advice. That person is not *necessarily* the lifeguards, many of whom have no real swimming background. (Frightening, isn't it?).

Here I will give you a short exposition on why incorporating kettlebell training into your overall regimen can reap great benefits.

How do we get strong? We all know that answer: heavy resistance training with progressive overload. How do we make sure we stay strong, and enjoy that strength by maintaining optimal mobility and postural integrity? That's a more complex question to answer, and one that I'm not going to tackle in full right now. What I am going to recommend to you today is this: if you don't own a kettlebell, purchase one and start doing the exercises I will detail below. If you do own one, perhaps you don't do all of these exercises, or don't do them often enough.

The three kettlebell exercises I am going to espouse here are the swing, the clean, and the get-up. Why those three? There are many uses for kettlebells, but these three in particular are especially useful. The swing because it is a premier movement for improving hip mobility and power production, the clean because it is a premier movement for improving shoulder stability and power production, and the get-up because it is a premier movement for, well, just about everything - shoulder health, hip health, core stability, you name it.

I'm posting three links here, each to an article or video pertaining to each one of the three exercises I am talking about. Note that what you'll find in these links aren't simple explanations of what the movements are; what you'll find is reasoning behind why I started doing these exercises, why I find them so useful, and why you should be doing them too. Here they are:

Review of a few studies.,16,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f59nv/caseinwhey_hydroslate_versus_nonhydrolyzed/,"Note: Mostly unbiased, but probably a bit ‘Pro’ for CHY if anything as assessed by the thoughts occurring throughout the review; Disclosure.

I decided to do this summary outside of my normal supplement reviews for a number of reasons. I read [this](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/casein-hydrolysate-and-anabolic-hormones-and-growth-research-review.html) review on the study. I don't wish to insult Lyle here, but omitting various excerpts from the study and quoting merely from the abstract is not the best argument. To contrast his review from an unbiased (but actually anti-Biotest, as evidenced by a plethora of needless insults) standpoint, I will review the same study from a slightly pro-Biotest standpoint. I like those guys.

I just cut and paste from Microsoft Word below; Please advance to the end summary if you do not care for the science and specifics. The first study is the one in question, the other studies cited are ones of interest to the topic at hand.

(**Edit**: 'Splanchnic' is in regards to the Splanchnic bed, which is a term used to describe the organs around the intestines. They usually get first dibs at the amino acids before they are sent to peripheral tissue, or muscle. This is also roughly where the 'Amino acid pool' is located (liver))

**[Hydrolyzed dietary casein as compared with the intact protein reduces postprandial peripheral, but not whole-body, uptake of nitrogen in humans]( http://www.ajcn.org/content/90/4/1011.short)**

- 96g carbohydrate, 23g soya oil, isonitrogenous solutions (Milk protein vs. Hydrolyzed protein)

- [Serum levels of Glucose, Insulin, and Glucagons]( http://www.ajcn.org/content/90/4/1011/F2.large.jpg)

- Insulin's AUC was **234%** more elevated after 8h in the hydrolyzed group.

- No differences noted in glucagons

- Total, dispensible, indispensible AA serum concentrations higher in HC at 1-3h and higher in IC at 5-7 hours with *exactly* the same 8-h AUC. Leucine kinetics followed the same path.

- [BCAA kinetics graph]( http://www.ajcn.org/content/90/4/1011/F3.large.jpg), the lower two (Indispensible AA) note that in the hydrolyzed group (HC), BCAA concentrations were much higher in serum at the 1-3 hour marks.

- “The absorption flux peaked earlier (1 h compared with 1 h and 45 min) and reached a higher level (17% compared with 9% of ingested N/h) after HC ingestion than after IC ingestion during the early postprandial period, whereas the opposite was observed for the 4–8 h after the meal. These different predicted responses were associated with a significant (P &lt; 0.0001) interaction between these 2 factors.”

- Final whole body nitrogen retention similar, higher nitrogen losses noted in the HC group at 3.5-6.5 hours.

- Peak serum AA noted at 2h after HC and 6h after IC

- Splanchnic use of AA was greater in HC, peripheral use was also greater in HC in the 4.5-8h marks.

- “Ingestion of the HC meal elicited a more rapid and intense flux of splanchnic anabolic use of dietary nitrogen (diet effect: P &lt; 0.05; diet × time effect: P &lt; 0.0001) than did the ingestion of IC meal. Kinetics of the peripheral anabolic use of dietary nitrogen also differed between groups with an earlier peak and a faster decrease from 4.5 to 8 h after the ingestion of HC than after ingestion of IC (diet effect: P &lt; 0.05; diet × time effect: P &lt; 0.0001)”

- At the 8h mark, HC had more composition stored in splanchnic than did IC

- “The regional distribution of dietary nitrogen 8 h after meal ingestion greatly differed between meals and was more located in the splanchnic area after HC than after IC (60% compared with 44%; P &lt; 0.0001), at the expense of peripheral incorporation (11% compared with 18%; P &lt; 0.0001).”

- Higher deamination rates in HC possibly due to higher peak of hyperaminoacidemia

- Admitted lack of studies comparing hydrolyzed protein sources against others in regards to muscle accretion.

- Starved rats (72 hours)

- Hydroslate vs. Whole protein vs. AA

- Higher Nitrogen retention in the Hydroslate (9% after 4 days compared with 5% and 2%) as measured via less urea excretion

- Did not compare Liquid Hydroslate vs. Liquid Isolate/Concentrate

**[Gastric emptying, gastric secretion and enterogastrone response after administration of milk proteins or their peptide hydrolysates in humans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15168035?dopt=Abstract)**

- CHY and Whole casein, when given as whole-protein liquid meals, had no differences in rate of gastric emptying.

**[Hydrolysis of casein accelerates gastrointestinal transit via reduction of opioid receptor agonists released from casein in rats](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15572871?dopt=Abstract)**

- “Independently, IC ingestion slows down intestinal transit time because of the action of opioid peptides released during digestion, whereas the hydrolysis of casein before its ingestion suppresses this effect and potentially accelerates intestinal transit time.”

- Used prior studies finding that casein activates opioid receptor (by acting as agonists) and slows down intestinal transit time.

- Found that, in 216 rats (needed to be sacrificed) that hydrolyzed casein did not activate said receptors and had significantly faster transit time in the intestine.

**[Peripheral and Splanchnic Metabolism of Dietary Nitrogen Are Differently Affected by the Protein Source in Humans as Assessed by Compartmental Modeling](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/1/125.abstract?ijkey=a77063ff7eff447c5a4332b718f1ec4da765110b&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha)**

- Found a relationship between how fast a protein is absorbed and how much is utilized in the splanchnic bed overall as percentage. Faster absorption means a greater percentage in the splanchnic bed rather than peripheral tissues.

**Summary**

- Overall nitrogen retention after 8 hours was similar between hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed forms. Greater retention and excretion was noted in hydrolyzed.

- Study was conducted with a 700kcal beverage with 70g (40%) protein for both groups. Was not solely protein.

- Various parameters such as insulin, glucose, aminoacidemia, and leucinemia, were noted as being significantly higher, faster, in the hydrolyzed group.

- Area-under-curve, or AUC (Overall amounts) was the same overall for amino acid levels in the blood, but was 234% higher for insulin levels.

- Splanchnic use of amino acids was higher in the hydrolyzed groups, and less of a percent was delivered to muscles at all times. However, the difference in peripheral tissues was 7% (18% vs. 11%) and nitrogen retention was the same overall. The differences in utilization is mostly due to speed, as faster proteins are typically devoted to a greater percentage to splanchnic tissues.

- Despite a higher amount of amino acids devoted to splanchnic tissues. More amino acids still passed through before the 2 hour marker to elicit a greater peak nitrogen utilization in the blood (17% vs. 9%)

- Stomach (Gastric) emptying of casein proteins is the same, regardless of form. However, casein becomes a slow-digesting protein in the ileum (intestine) when it activates opioid receptors. Hydrolyzed casein does not activate these receptors and thus has higher ileum uptake rates.

**What do if not biochemist?** otherwise known as **Whooooosh**...

- Hydrolyzed proteins (Whey and casein hydroslate) are a controversial topic. And the most touted sources are a supplement company that sells it (Biotest) and bloggers who seem to have a hard-on for hating Biotest; nary an unbiased source in sight.

- Hydrolyzed proteins seem to have significant differences in intestinal digestion and blood readings when compared to non-hydrolyzed (intact) proteins. These differences are correlated with muscular growth (insulin, hyperaminoacidemia) and performance (insulin, glucose)

- Hydrolyzed proteins' differences can be taken advantage of in a timely manner, specifically around workouts. However, their benefits seem to balance out over the long run, so they will not be the best option for meal replacements.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_f59nv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f59nv/caseinwhey_hydroslate_versus_nonhydrolyzed/,

Something that I think is just as important, but maybe not discussed as much, is what makes a good trainee? 

I've competed in a couple of sports in my lifetime, most of my experience was as a swimmer as a young teenager. I was probably a pretty horrible person to coach and mentor, given I was somewhat of a rebellious kid and ended up quitting swimming after falling out with coach. From that experience I've learned that it is key is to be able to listen and respect your coach. 

I think generally I've got the most out of a coach when:

* I've listened and had a genuine interest in what a coach is saying
* Have been able to understand the concept they're explaining and be able to ask for guidance when something just isn't making sense

What I think is also pretty important is

* the ability to apply without too much thought the technical alterations a coach is making with your technique

With weightlifting in particular, I've found that given the fast and dynamic nature of the lifts means that if you think too much about what you're doing at that given moment, you'll undoubtedly mess up and not apply technical alterations that a coach may be trying to instruct you in. 

Something else that I think that is very important is the ability for the trainee to work through, almost grind through, the really tough patches. Even in a year of weightlifting I've seen people come and go, people start lifting and show some real potential and then just disappear when a difficult patch in training happens.

Long squat history short, when I first started lifting I only did did high bar half squats. At some point I realized I was a dumbass, and started doing high bar squats to what I thought was parallel, to [C instead of D](http://i.imgur.com/ErvyA.png). Eventually I fixed that problem, and was finally squatting to proper depth, but with a high bar position. As you can imagine, this was a very inefficient way to train, and led to lots of deloads and frustration.

Then, I watched ""So You Think You Can Squat"", and was told that the low bar squat where you sit back will allow you to squat a lot more than the high bar ""sitting down"" squats I was doing. Well, I thought, those guys are powerlifters, I want to compete some day, better listen to what they're talking about."" I tried their way, and it was awkward and weak, and made me have to deload a shit ton of weight, yet again. My hamstrings and glutes just weren't used to this new strain that was being placed on them. Its been a long grueling road, but I'm getting a bit better at the low bar ""sit back"" squats, but the number is still nowhere near my high bar ""down"" strength. For example, last squat day, I did 245x3 low bar and back, before failure. For a comparison (and to maintain my quad strength) I followed that with high bar and down squats. 265x5. That's a *huge* fucking difference.

So, is it worth it for me to keep pushing through this foreign squat style for the added lbs in the long run, or should I quit fucking around with my routine and just keep building up what I already have?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_jusy3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/jusy3/for_the_last_several_months_i_have_been_trying_to/,

The night before a particularly heavy session, I'll literally be anxious enough to have trouble sleeping because I'm worried about lifting in the morning.

On the other hand, being unmotivated, too relaxed, and otherwise un-amped is obviously not optimal either.
  
I've seen lots of people on here say they visualize the set first and only attempt it if they *know* they can make it, but when I've tried such tactics, my results were not consistently positive. How do you psych yourself *up*, but not *out*?
  
And I'd like to pose another question: What percentage (hypothetically of course) is psychological? Let's say my squat ORM is 250, but you've tricked me and loaded more than that on the bar, maybe 260, I'd probably lift it, right?

I'm pretty excited about finding this study, chiefly due to the results showing nearly identical hypertrophy in individuals lifting with either a low rep or intermediate rep training program. All the groups lifted to failure with each set, and the low rep group showed the greatest 1RM strength improvements. There was a high rep group, but they showed very different adaptations.

Basically, what this study says to me is that up to a point, the effort of lifting is what determines the hypertrophy response rather than what the rep range is. The effort of each group was controlled by having the groups lift to failure, and lo and behold, the non-endurance groups experienced similar hypertrophy despite different lifting intensities. In addition, the muscle fiber type proportions were the same for the low and intermediate groups. Because of this, I believe that the higher 1RM improvement in the low group was primarily neurological in nature. If there had been a 10RM test done, I bet the intermediate group would have improved the most.

The only weakness I can see here is that the subjects were untrained, and that admittedly makes a big difference. However, the adaptations were different for the high rep group, which means that even untrained individuals don't adapt identically to different resistance training modes.

That hypertrophy is pretty much the same with different intensities when effort is controlled for has long been something I've suspected, and this points to a confirmation of the idea. Maybe some day I'll get the resources to do a similar study with trained individuals and a 10RM test.

As someone who has enjoyed working out for years, but only recently started caring about what I actually put into my body, I have found that the most difficult part of a proper diet is the planning and preparation. Weighing my food, counting my macros and planning meals takes up a considerable amount of time (that I typically don't have!), so I started trying to think of an easier way and came up with an idea.  

I'm interested to know if there would be any interest in a meal planning service geared towards people with active lifestyles. Something like a cross between a fitness calculator, nutri-system and grocery delivery service.  The service would be a web application where you could pick individual foods (chicken, bow tie pasta, ice cream, etc.) and create a grocery list based on your dietary needs and then have them delivered weekly.  The foods would be fresh, not precooked, and would be proportioned accurately and separated into days and meals to remove the guesswork from your diet.  As you choose foods in the application you will be able to see how they contribute to your daily and weekly macros, and the application would keep a running diary of your intakes. From a cost perspective, there would be an up-charge on your groceries for the planning/prep that we are projecting would be ~20%.  

There is a lot of planning and development that would need to go into an idea like this, so I want to gauge interest before we take the time to build the application and jump through the food-service hoops that would be required.  We would start in Washington, DC and would need 20 people to express an interest for us to move forward.  If we find that there is sufficient demand we would be able to expand to the following cities relatively quickly, so if you live in one of them and would be interested please let me know:

- Cleveland, OH
- Columbus, OH
- Cincinnati, OH
- Chicago, IL
- Philadelphia, PA
- Boston, MA
- New York, NY
- Denver, CO
- Raleigh, NC

For the most part, I train like powerlifters. I adhere to the techniques and training methods, and read up on articles. The form I practice is exactly how Dave Tate of efts demonstrates in his videos. However, I have had one harrowing issue for a number of years: my left shoulder exhibits major weakness during 1RMs and deep into sets on heavy weights. This problem seems to go away over time, but it returns with hiatuses of any length. My most recent break was around 3 weeks (school, work, you know the deal), and nearly all of my lifts have remained in the same range, but for bench. 

This problem has persisted over the years, and it always goes away with the strengthening of my shoulder, but I was wondering if there were a way to perhaps make the fix more permanent. 

The issue is as follows: during stressful loads, it seems I cannot keep my left arm's position stable, and the entire bar (the left half) seems to move rostrally (where caudal is tail-wards and rostral is towards the head). This seems to be the reason I fail any reps, according to my lifting buddies. It's almost as if the barbell were on an axis perpendicular to my neck, and the bar rotates counterclockwise. 

tl;dr: 1RM causes shoulder to give, barbell rotates rather than moving vertically

Any suggestions? More details can be provided upon request.


Edit: Thanks to those who have replied so far. As far as maintenance of this issue goes, I've picked up the external rotation work I used to do. Obviously, I cannot gauge the effects just yet, but if anybody's interested I will keep you posted. I think ceasing standing barbell military presses definitely helped my shoulder feel better overall, but that may have simply been a technique issue. 

Hopefully I will be able to resolve all problems with enough time, and avoid any future damage elsewhere. Thanks again, keep it up with the suggestions!",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_majdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/majdc/benching_issue/,

I'm a lacrosse player on my university's club team and a kinesiology major focusing in sports psychology. As I am both the strongest and most experienced/knowledgable person on my team, I've been put in charge of physical conditioning for at least the off-season. I've been learning a lot as I go using myself and my 8-10 teammates as test subjects and from reading a lot about this subject. I hope to be a professional S&amp;C coach in the distant future. 

I have read a lot of conflicting information on periodization. Some people really like it for the strength sports, where meets/events are strictly scheduled and programming can be done to a T. Our competitive season for lacrosse is the spring, and last spring we played 13 games in 14 weeks. I avoided burnout during this time by reducing volume for the 1-2 workouts before a game and I ran WS4SB during season. This worked fine for maintenance.

I'd like your opinions on off-season programming and progression. Right now the team is doing WS4SB because they were all raw beginners when I started with them in May. They've been gaining steadily and can all do a &gt;BW 5-rep squat. I am more advanced and have been lifting 5 days/week on a power/speed/volume upper/lower split. My idea for some sort of periodization is this, but here is where I need help--

April 25 to June 3: Beginner program, full-body 3x/wk, deload

June 20 to Aug 1: WS4SB, deload

Aug 8 to Sept 19: Pre-season, Power/Hypertrophy/Conditioning (?)

Oct 3 to Nov 17: Fall season (rare games), Power/Speed (?)

Nov28 to Jan 20: Winter (offseason), Power/Hypertrophy split (?)

Jan 20 to May 20: Spring season (almost weekly games), maintenance (?)

Basically, what are the best times to focus on power, hypertrophy, conditioning, and speed given one competitive season and one less-competitive season in a sprint/rest/sprint sport?

It's somewhat common knowledge amongst weightlifters (both of the olympic and powerlifting variety) and other high intensity exercise enthusiasts that CNS fatigue is something to be mindful of. People like [Christian Thibaudeau over at T-Nation](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_thib_system_8212_fatigue_and_best_exercises) say that: ""it's possible to drain the nervous system so much that it takes so long to recover that the muscles actually start to detrain while the CNS is still recovering"". That's definitely something most people want to avoid.

Signs of CNS fatigue include general fatigue, incoordination, and even an impaired immune system. [This article here](http://www.criticalbench.com/CNS_central_nervous_system_fatigue.htm) gives a great overview of the symptoms of CNS fatigue. 

The article also goes into the causes of CNS fatigue such as: *""The theory is the high 5-HT/low Dopamine brings on CNS Fatigue with low 5-HT/high Dopamine resulting in enhanced performance""*. I also found a scientific study on the [Possible mechanisms of central nervous system fatigue during exercise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9000155) which seems to agree with the previous article's assertion.

I know that on the weightlifting side of things deadlifts and squats (which are both heavy, multi-joint/compound movments) can quickly fatigue the CNS. Thibaudeau ranks olympic and explosive lifts as even more taxing on the CNS than squats or deadlifts. From anecdotal experience I know that CNS fatigue generally affects the weightlifter the day *after* or even two days after lifting and on the more ""broscience"" side of things I read (God help me if I can't remember where) that limiting lifts to only 5 reps or less of anything above about 90% of your 1rm threshold can minimize CNS fatigue.

As far as cures for CNS go the most common cure would be rest and adequate nutrition. What exactly adequate nutrition is, other than a calorie surplus high in protein, beyond me. The second aforementioned article suggested that BCAAs (Branched Chain Amino Acids) could also aid recovery.

It's something I can live with during regular work sets, but obviously this wastes a lot of energy during max attempts. It's only on the first rep.

I simply wanted to share it with those who might enjoy a full departure from sports that so easily benefit from the textbook sweat and iron.

Sports-specific goal:

* Increase maximal climbing strength and power
* Increase bouldering grade

Increasing localized muscular anaerobic endurance was not part of the training objectives, as it would interfere with the main objective.
____


Bouldering is a sport dependent not only on strength-to-weight ratio, but also the distribution of weight in your body, and your finger tendons' capacity to support that weight.  Listed below are some training challenges:

* Cardio needs to avoid building leg muscle
* Sport-specific training is *extremely* taxing to tendons in fingers and forearms
* Sport-specific training creates muscular imbalances if not offset with specific antagonist training
* Overtraining symptoms are noticeable on shorter time-frames than many other sports (in my experience) [side note: this was more apparent when training the localized anaerobic endurance for climbing prior to my decision to commit to a more pointed training program for strength and power]
* Leg muscle *atrophy* is actually preferable to a large extent
* Hip flexor strength is very important
* Core strength and *power* is extremely important
* Muscle hypertrophy is not desirable under any circumstances
* Weight gain is not an option

Some notions that my training reinforced:

* Full hydration, despite increased weight, reduces risk for tendon/soft tissue injury.
* Influence of pre-workout nutrition and proper rest on intramuscular coordination, neural performance, and learning is extremely obvious.  Disregard for this fact can lead to injury.
* Ego can be extremely detrimental to progress, and can lead to injury
* Body composition improvement using solely diet is preferable to using a combination of diet and aerobic and/or anaerobic work, as aerobic or anaerobic endurance training would affect hydration, and the development of sport-specific muscles and tendons.
* Increased circulation through tendons in fingers for the purposes of repair and growth is accomplished with a combination of vigorous massage and hot/cold therapy.
* Core strength development could be accomplished using many techniques used in many other sports - bridges, roll-outs, back extensions, etc.  These exercises also aided in the development of hip flexor strength.
* Ballet flexibility and strength exercises are applicable to the sport as well, disregarding any isometric or plyometric leg exercises.
* Meditation/mental training is invaluable for focus and for ""ego control""",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_fiah3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/fiah3/a_bit_of_insight_into_my_training/,

- If localized growth factors are the main signaling reason for muscle growth (more significant than whole-body test and GH), could there be localized factors for fat loss as well?

- The body would most likely store triacylglyerides back as tissue in the areas where there is less, meaning that once you eat a caloric surplus the fat is going to be gained where it was locally lost; but what would happen if you didn't store triacylglycerides?

I would like to know, if anyone knows of similar training models that can be used for weight training?



Background: Training with power has revolutionised cycling in the last 10 years or so.  There are lots of interesting aspects to it, and data that it gives you.  If people are interested in the nitty gritty, a good place to start is here: 



[http://home.trainingpeaks.com/power411.aspx](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/power411.aspx)
[http://www.cyclingpowerlab.com/TrainingWithPower.aspx](http://www.cyclingpowerlab.com/TrainingWithPower.aspx)
[http://www.tpesportscoaching.com/CP_intro.html](http://www.tpesportscoaching.com/CP_intro.html)



The basic concept is to reference everything to your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) which is defined as the average power output you could sustain for 1 hour on the bike, flat out.  One training goal then is to raise this threshold, as it underpins your performance in shorter duration efforts.



One of the useful results from knowing your FTP is being able to reasonably accurately quantify training stress between vastly different workouts.  The accepted formula for training stress is:



TSS = 100*(time of workout in hours)*(average power of workout/FTP)^2



If you know that your FTP is (say) 250W, then a 2 hour ride with an average 150W would give you a TSS of 72.  Similarly a 2x20min effort at your threshold of 250W would give a TSS of 67, so in terms of training stress, these two workouts are similar and should provide a similar training effect.  



If you know the training stress, then you can also estimate the recovery time, and start to quantify the amount of training effect you see from a particular volume of training stress.  Additionally, you can start to predict performance by estimating the amount of fatigue built up by training stress.



It is a bit complicated, but is reasonably well accepted in the cycling community as it seems to get results.



**So then with that background, does AdvancedFitness know of similar models for weight training?**



It strikes me, that it should be pretty amenable to this sort of analysis.  We have weight lifted, reps, % of 1RM, and I've seen the Prilepin tables which hints at these sort of relationships.

1360680247.0,11,self.AdvancedFitness,18dmyh,Push movements - the shoulder tuck vs shoulder shrug,18,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/18dmyh/push_movements_the_shoulder_tuck_vs_shoulder_shrug/,"So the standard rule, when doing pushing movements, is that you want to retract (pinch blades together) and depress the blades. Simple cue is to try to tuck your shoulder into a pocket onto the opposite ass.

I understand the reasoning - it gives you a base, your lower/mid traps are engaging, it gives you a shelf, etc.

I've been dealing with some shoulder problems for a while, and with my shirt off, it's been obvious that my scapula is rotating forward - this causes impingement and a host of problems.

So the solution (that seems to be working) is for me to strengthen my lower/mid traps, have them ""pull"" the blade back. And it's been working - even pushups used to hurt, and thinking of the mind-muscle connection on them seems to be working.

My question really concerns elevation (shrugging) of the shoulder. While helping someone with their OHP (yes the irony), he talked about how in SS Rippetoe mentions that you should shrug at the top movement of the OHP. I've read on TNation (and in /r/weightroom) how shrugging on bench helps.

So just dicking around (with an empty bar), I found that with even the slightest elevation, it honestly ""felt"" much better - that I wasn't getting impinged, that there was a lot more space in the shoulder girdle (for the respective bones).

So how large is that difference and should we account for that when counting calories or is it negligible?

I can upload a video if that would be helpful, but knee-caving is a pretty common thing.

Are there exercises that can correct this weakness? I'm assuming it's a muscular weakness in the hip abd(or add)uctors but I don't know a. if that is correct or b. if there are specific exercises to correct that.

I tend to back squat once a week and either front squat or deadlift once a week, with hamstring and hip work thrown in as assistance work after. Not sure typical heavy day looks like this--

5x5: Back/Front Squat or Deadlift

3-4 x 8-12

GHR/Hip Thrust and Squat/Rack Pull

Ab Wheel and/or Palloff Press

**edit:** here's what I've learned so far and think I'll implement

1. Making a conscious effort during non-ME sets to ~~exaggerate~~ focus on pushing the knees out

Any athletes on here care to contribute? I'll do mine for my current sport, lacrosse, and we can add things as we go.



Lacrosse

Type of sport: Sprint/Rest/Sprint

Position: Defense

Physicality: High. It helps to be big. 

Current training program: I've been using WS4SB by Defranco for my in-season training for about 2 months now. This is essentially 1 separate heavy day for upper/lower body with 2 days of moderate weight or explosive/dynamic work. I find that it works well for my in-season training because I avoid burning out and can actually improve my strength instead of just maintaining or backsliding. I plan on running a 4-6 week cycle of German Volume Training at the end of my season and I'd be interested on your opinions on this. 

Conditioning: Lots. Even though defensemen don't do as much running as midfielders, if the ball gets stuck on our side of the field we could potentially be running short (10-20 yard) sprints with little-no rest for around 2-5 minutes. Our coach typically has us run 60-yard shuttles, 50-100 yard gassers, and/or 35-50-yard suicides.

Diet: I'm one of (if not the only) player on the team who is nutrition-conscious and I carb-backload. I generally lift at 2, begin feeding after that, have practice at 7, and then continue eating until I sleep. I drink about once a month during season. I have experimented with paleo, see-food, and carb-cycling over the last two years, so far backloading has worked best. 

Common injuries: Give a bunch of 20 year-olds sticks and some injuries are bound to happen. Bruises are a constant, broken bones are occasional. The amount of running we do necessitates my stretching/soft tissue release regimen lest I slide back into shinsplints and general pain. The skinny/weak of those on our team find that they get knocked around significantly more on field than the larger and stronger, although you can still be good as a lacrosse player without significant size or strength.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_fkpwv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/fkpwv/athletes_sound_off/,

By way of [Brad Appleton](http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs/rec/stretching/stretching_3.html#SEC20):


* **Passive Flexibility** is the ability to assume extended positions and then maintain them using only your weight, the support of your limbs, or some other apparatus
* **Active Flexibility** is the ability to assume and maintain extended positions using only the tension of the agonists and synergists while the antagonists are being stretched
* **Dynamic Flexibility** is the ability to perform dynamic (or kinetic) movements of the muscles to bring a limb through its full range of motion in the joints

Most ""stretching"" routines cover only passive stretches. There's nothing wrong with this. You cannot gain active or dynamic flexibility without *first* having passive flexibility. But the real conundrum is that there tend not to be any good recommendations or routines for gaining active or dynamic flexibility. Even martial arts advice on kicking height always seems to be just passive stretching recommendations.

Sure, you can achieve high active flexibility simply through having decent passive flexibility and strong enough agonist muscles, but is this the best way?

I'm here looking for answers. Is the best way to gain active flexibility to simply work on passive flexibility and strengthen the agonist muscles? Or would a dedicated active stretching routine be beneficial? Would it be a waste of time? Similarly, would more focus on dynamic stretching (leg and arm swings) be beneficial or a waste of time?

If it matters, I'm primarily looking to improve my lateral leg flexibility, both active and dynamic for things such as side kicks and straddle holds.

Details and specifics inside,22,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/1dsbea/help_with_shoulder_reprehab_details_and_specifics/,"So a little background: when I was young and ignorant ~15 years old or about 8 years ago, I was doing dumbbell OHP with far too much weight. Left arm went up, struggled, and it rotated back under the weight. Hurt pretty bad but not bad enough to go to a doctor or anything and I don't think it was too too serious. 

About 5 years later, playing handball (like racquetball but with your hands), I went to hit with my left hand overhand basically in a throwing motion, heard some weird noises and it hurt again. But also not too bad, was fine the next day just a bit sore. Saw a doctor this time and he just told me to be careful with it. 

From then on I never did much weightlifting until about a year ago, only ran a lot (3 season track athlete). Now that I'm getting into the heavier weightlifting (heavy for 1 year of lifting) my shoulder has been bothering me again.

Current situation: I've been doing the [Power Muscle Burn 5 Day Powerbuilding Split](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/power-muscle-burn-5-day-powerbuilding-split.html) and getting some great progress on my OHP now that it has its own devoted day after 6 months of SS.

I can't do French Presses without my shoulder feeling loosey goosey. I tried subbing it out for dumbbell overhead tricep extensions and my shoulder felt loosey goosey with those too. The OHPs and Arnold Presses feel fine to do but I always feel a bit sore deep in my shoulder after.

I plan on switching to the [The ""Boring But Big"" 3-Month Challenge](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_boring_but_big_3month_challenge) after the summer so I want to use the summer to focus solely on shoulder re/pre-hab as the title states.

I've read the [T-Nation Shoulder Savers by Eric Cressey](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/shoulder_savers_part_i) through a couple times and it has pointed me in the right direction. I just need a bit more guidance in narrowing down the plethora of recommended exercises in the article and am admittedly a bit lost when it gets this in depth (remember: only been into heavy lifting for 1 year or so)

So I come to you asking for some guidance in the best shoulder re/pre-hab work to do for my specific situation and goals.

I am 23 years old, 155 pounds and can OHP 135x5 but have been training at 125-130x3x5 on the Power Muscle Burn program.

Also when intermuscular administered, IGF-1 concentrations are increased allowing for an increased rate of tissue repair and an increase in muscle size comparable with the most potent anabolic steroids.   It boosts strength, size and stamina and has anti-aging characteristics. Also it has anti inflammatory properties, of which if it is administered into a tissue injury straight after its occurrence, it will stop swelling and pain and up regulate genetic pathways to signal repair of that tissue.  
It does not interfere with your bodies own Growth Hormone release, which is around every 3 hours, but it amplifies it up to 10 times, which is equivalent to levels when using synthetic Human Growth Hormone. Because it doesn’t interfere with your growth cycle, you do not end up with any down regulation, like with using synthetic growth hormone, which leads to undesired side effects. It cannot be picked up in any drug test, either urine or blood, because it is just a protein and breaks down to urea like any other normal protein in the body, plus it is bound to Albumin in blood which is the normal transport system for protein in the body, so detection is virtually impossible because there are millions of sequences of different proteins bound to Albumin.  Currently, WADA have no interest in trying to develop tests for proteins, as this would be very difficult and protein peptides do not fall into any category on the WADA banned list.  Also, even if your growth hormone levels are very high at the time of testing, you will not fail a urine or blood test, because WADA are testing for synthetic growth hormone and not natural occurring growth hormone. Think of NBA basketballers, their natural growth hormone is a lot higher than normal. WADA only recently developed an accurate test for synthetic growth hormone, because in the past they could not distinguish between natural and synthetic, in which natural they do not test for because it is natural.

Whenever I've been squatting or deadlifting, I've been focused on basically keeping a neutral back but without thinking too much about contracting my lower back muscles to maintain tightness.

Obviously, this is a problem I should fix. I've noticed before that I had butt wink when I did ATG air squats, but I didn't really worry about it (I remember someone telling me that butt wink with air squats didn't necessarily mean I had butt wink with weighted squats). However, after reading Magnusson's post, I realized the reason I got butt wink in the first place was probably a failure to keep my lower back tight. I then tried doing air squats again while keeping the lower back tight and found that I could only get to about parallel while keeping my back tight; any lower meant that I would be sacrificing tightness and getting the butt wink again.

What I'm wondering is: what does this mean for my lifting? Is it *possible*, even, to maintain full lumbar arch when going ATG? If so, how should I go about working to achieve this? I always prided myself on having the flexibility to go ATG easily, but now seeing my lack of ability to maintain a tight back while descending all the way is kind of frustrating.

1311414371.0,13,self.AdvancedFitness,ixkb1,Call for Member Spotlight nominations - the queue is almost empty,17,4,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ixkb1/call_for_member_spotlight_nominations_the_queue/,"It's time for another shoutout from nominations.

We've had [24 Member Spotlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/search?q=Member+Spotlight&amp;restrict_sr=on) so far and they've been a great success.

Right now I have no plan to move from weekly spotlights. The queue is close to empty right now. A sudden surge of votes (4 or 5  lucky) would last a month. The weekly spot allows the everyone to look forward to it and enjoy it (and gives me time to get it done).

Occasionally I get a few weeks ahead behind the scenes, but more often than not the nominee only has a week to answer. The biggest problem occurs when I get no response to my initial email, then none from the next in line, since I have to wait a few days for each to be sure. 

EDIT: This sometimes leaves nominees with little time to write, and writing up a response can be a time consuming process. Sometimes we're down to a hour or two before I have to edit and post, and this leads to other problems with me making mistakes in submissions.

[Pulmonaryapathy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/gy29c/member_spotlight_pulmonaryapathy/) has been the most upvoted and [Hydra's](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/fq6g4/member_spotlight_silverhydra/) has generated the most discussion. 

We've only had two ladies so far and I think we'd all like to see that change.

Let me clarify my criteria/request:

The idea is to spotlight people from whom we can learn AND whom have contributed to reddit. 

This can mean high profile active contributors on any of the fitness reddits.

Benched 400 and mentioned once in a comment? Congrats. But unless the person is part of the reddit community through participation, they will not be accepted. (Where people have previously been nominated with low karma, I have gone back and checked their history later, EDIT: they stay in the queue.) 

**There is a minimum comment karma of 1000 as an entry requirement**. 

EDIT: *No* answer is obligatory. Usually pictures are the only real bone of contention.

You might not like this limit but I'm sticking with it, it works well for planning and selecting. The advantage of this is it has kept out some claims I've seen from people who have no history here or have been flash-in-the-pan redditors who've disappeared.

* Send nominations to the [nominate](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=nominate) link. I check it fairly regularly but it could get to a week or even more before you get a response. 

EDIT: If you don't get a response, it does not mean that the nomination wasn't received. Every nomination received has been checked. Ultimately, we have to decide. Short of publicly voting on every nomination (frankly implausible) at some point *decisions* have to made by one or two people (svunt and I).

* Please provide the user link to the user you are nominating.

* Tell me why you are nominating them. (Mispelled user names with no reason doesn't make my life easier).

* Previous features members: Can you think more about nominations please?


* Most of you guys love talking about lifting. The diversity we've started to see has been fantastic also. Let's have more people from other sports.

* Some people have nominated themselves. I've (politely) rejected these requests unless someone else nominated them.

EDIT: Some rejections were later featured.


The Member Spotlight is about our community. It's about learning from each other and celebrating each other's successes. It's NOT about personal gripes or vendettas. I don't want to see any bitching or back-biting in there. Feel free to disagree with each other, but keep it civil.

**EDIT**: The nomination queue is private. Only svunt &amp; I have access to know who's lined up. Some public nominations may already have been added or discussed or rejected. It's past of the reason for asking for nominations via PM also. Another is so that we can keep nominations coralled out of our own accounts, &amp; make it easier for us to manage.

If you all want to me leave Member Spotlight, that's fine. I've asked the mods to decide. My opinions are my own, and are not censorship. No-one is entitled to tell me what to think.

**EDIT 2**:

I've discussed it with the mods.

* I'm staying. Sorry. Better keep the pitchforks and flaming torches handy just in case though. Maybe I'm really Saydrah.
* I haven't changed my own opinion on self-respect. Some of you seemed to misunderstand my position on this. It's not about what anyone else thinks, I derive my self-respect internally. It was about what *I* think, and how *I* react as a consequence, that determines my own self-respect.
* Scottydog pointed out to me that RedAnarchist had publicly acknowledged he was wrong. I had thought that by deleting my inadvertent repost that the subsequent discussion was also gone, so I had not returned to the discussion. So I did not know this. Therefore I apologise to Advanced Fitness for bringing up all this nonsense and thank Scotty for the clarification. It was my mistake.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/id1uk/seriously_whats_the_best_time_to_stretch/) is an example of a worthless post. OP asks a question and does not show any thought beyond ""I heard"" and ""this seems to be the consensus"" and has clearly not done research beyond that.

Research. Do more research. Write your post. Read it back. Then post.

**EDIT** for clarity: My problem is not the content of the post, but the content of the poster. I have no problem talking stretching, programming, or anything else as long as the OP brings something with them to the discussion. There is no excuse for not doing at least a brief search on Google before posting so you have some idea of what people are talking about.

2 questions here, one about my relative weakness in the OHP and one about doing it seated.

1. I currently weigh 95kg (15+% BF) and my benchpress 1RM is approx. 130kg.
However my standing barbell shoulder press 1RM is only approx. 73kg.
I use a thumbless grip just outside where the knurling begins, bar rests in my palm (so I don't have a ""wrist-lever""), squeeze my glutes, brace my core, elbow position throughout the lift is fine etc. Form is not the problem imo. 
Should I just quit bitching and keep training? I would like to press my own bodyweight one day but that seems like a long way to go.

2. The ceiling in my appartement is only 2m30 high, I am 1m85 so I can't really overhead press while standing. Last 531 cycle I did my overhead presses seated on my bench, without a back support. Should I keep doing it like this or is it better to put my bench in the most upright position and do the presses with back support?

If you need more info, just ask!

If you don't know what TM is google it.

Brief background on me: I signed up for Tough Mudder Melbourne in the interests of challenging myself and having something to train for that incorporated both strength work and middle distance running.

Couple of Criticisms: 

1. TM call their event the toughest event on the planet. It's a pretty laughable label when you think about it. We'd seen the Ironman event in Melbourne the weekend before and it's childs play beside that.

2. Spectator tickets on the day were $40. Only $15 if you bought the ticket before the event. I still can't believe or understand this. Considering spectators didn't get to see a whole lot, it's just a complete rip off.

3. Apparently later in the day there were quite long lines for obstacles making the course much less fun in the afternoon. I was in the first wave on the first day and never waited at an obstacle though. I got through the course in about 2 hours, a friend of mine who is much faster than me took 3 1/2 hours later in the day due to waiting at obstacles.

The course really was a lot of fun and the whole event very well organised. The obstacles I thought would be hard turned out to be pretty easy and obstacles I expected to be easy turned out a bit harder than I thought.

Stand out obstacles: The ice bath I was dreading but you're pretty warm by the time you get there, you're in and out and back in the sun. It's no problem really. 

The quarter pipe is tough as they cover it in water and detergent and you have to really run at it to get to the top. After already running 19k it's difficult to sprint. Took me a couple of goes to get to the top.

Electric wires: I personally didn't get a strong shock from these, just felt like someone flicking me. Did see people screaming and jumping, not sure if they were just sooks, higher adrenaline or people got shocked differently.

A few guys there were running in bare feet that I saw getting their feet stitched back up by the medics at around the 9k mark. Probably should've ran in bear feet instead... *sorry*

Lots of guys who obviously didn't run enough in training were cramping up by around 14 - 16k mark. Injuries, cramps and puke were pretty common for about 2k there.

Lots of twisted ankles on the course as well as most of it was run over pretty uneven terrain in paddocks.

Overall the obstacles were relatively easy for someone in good physical condition. Not a lot of strength required really. Having run some half marathons before I'd say this was probably easier.

Race swag was pretty meh. A cheap t-shirt, headband and a beer.

I started working out late May.

height: 5'9""

Weight: 164lbs (down from 190 when I started)

I lift 6 days a week, attempting to PR every time I lift.

Current numbers:

* Squat: 270

* Deadlift: 385

* OHP: 155

* PC: 185

* Bench: 210

The first 3 months I was working out I was doing Keto, decided it was hindering me too much in the gym, switched to TKD + intermittent fasting.
Still I look like my bodyfat% is really high (Read: I look fat)

Decided 2 months ago to start hitting a caloric deficit and monitoring every. single. thing. that went into my mouth.
Last month for 30 days I did 1500 calories per day (Except thanksgiving) and started taking EA pre gym.
Still yet I wasn't seeing results so I added TTA, zinc, Omega-3, and a 1-a-day multi to my pre workout cocktail. I've been doing on average 1200 calories/day. Sometimes I go up to 1500, sometimes I stay as low as 800.

I've been getting a minimum of 150g protein every day, usually much more.

I only eat carbs pre gym for sugar boost, and post gym for protein synthesis.

I get 40-50g carbs pre and 20-30 post (All high GI)

Why the fuck am I still fat?

P.S.- Yes, I've lost inches on my waist (From a tight 34 to a loose 31), and that's great, but I've been stuck for like three months at this fat gelatinous state and it's seriously starting to fuck with my head.
p.s.#2- I don't give a single fuck about my bodyweight. I care about strength and bf%.
Edit: I guess I should mention I do the terribly unreliable electronic bodyfat test device once a weekat the gym, it's told me from day 1 I was between 14% and 18% every time, since I started working out 7 months ago. The idiot trainers at my gym won't let me do the caliper pinch test to myself ""because I am not qualified"" yet, every single time theyve done it (Once a month since I started in late may) They've told me I was 28% and tried to tell me what I'm doing wrong ""Clearly you need to eat 6 portions of nothing but grilled chicken breast, brown rice, and sweet potato every day.""",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_n6f7o,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/n6f7o/struggling_with_bodyfat_loss_and_appearance_yet/,

One thing I have noticed from here and from my experience is that those on r/fitness do a 3x5 or a 5x5 program for months and keep seeing gains.  This is quite different from my experience in sports where we consistantly change between strength, hypertrophy and power ever 4-6 weeks.  We keep doing similar exercises but the rep/set scheme changes between 3x5, 4x12 and 3-3-2-1-3.

This is basic periodization similar to aerobic training where you periodize between long steady state and interval training.  

But what I don't understand is why it is so easy for us to plateau but these beginers on SS will do it for months to a year.  I've seen it both on myself in other rowers and all coaches I've discussed rowing and weight training with say the same thing: you need to periodize to prevent plateaus.  Given they are starting from an empty bar and do get 'begginer gains' while we start from where we know is near our max for that rep-set scheme, I just haven't seen the same gains they get of 5 lbs a session.  

There's also the cortisol and the 8 other workouts that week that could contribute...

Just how much volume is too much? Well, depends on your goals, your experience, your diet, your ability to recover, ect. ect. ect.


[I was recently enchanted by Layne Norton's PHAT -power hypertrophy adoptive training.](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html)

Two considerations before we get started:

-I am aware that he has a PhD and that I do not.

-I am aware that he is a championship bodybuilder and that I am not.


The thing to keep in mind, based on my reading, is that Norton designed this program to be mold-able. So while some of my methodology may differ slightly from his example template, please don't resort to the ""what the fuck do you know, douchefag?!"" -type comments. Constructive criticism is appreciated.

[Here is a link to my proposed routine.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&amp;hl=en_US&amp;key=0Agin9sQC6kZYdGk1enFsNWMxQTFpTFc1bmRsQm5tdGc&amp;output=html)

Anyways, a bit of my background- lifetime in athletics, up to and including ncaa lacrosse, prior service Marine, volunteer firefighter with a daytime desk job, advanced level lifter in the big four by exrx standards, just finishing up a summer cut. I plan to start my new split around December, a week after I come off of my 6th, and final 5/3/1 cycle and finish up fire academy. 

My goal through early spring is to pack on muscle and maintain strength by adopting this intense program and eating above maintenance 5 days a week via an IF dieting approach. You'll see my Wendler/Starr/Rippetoe influence showing in my take of Norton's training philosophy. 

I err on the side of free-weights and really am not much of a fan of machines. I really only included three instances of machine-specific work (occasional incline cable flies, smith calf raises, and some leg extensions), though I am open to input. 

I also have a barbell boner, so I stick to mostly BB movements on power days (with the exception of the press) and mostly DB movements on hypertrophy days (with the exception of squats).

Since so many of these movements incorporate core stabilizers, I only added two ab-centric movements, my favorites: the HLR and the Dragon Flag.

I purposefully target arms and chest, as mine are slightly lagging behind where I *want* to be size-wise. YMMV, but I feel like I have a pretty decent spread, and the over-reaching principles are not too far off of Norton's original template.

Whew, so that's what I have in mind.

Biggest question is reps and sets per heavy/fast lifts.

Comments, critiques, suggestions?

Oh and I should say that I'm focusing more on front squats over back squats at the moment.

Is such a program meant only for very advanced people?

Here are my 1RMs:

* Squat: 285 (Don't care about)
* Dead: 325 (Want to improve.)
* Press: 130 (Meh.)
* Front Squat: 215 (Want to improve.)
* Bench: 185 (This is most irritating.)
* DB Row: ~105? (Meh.)

edit: Just cut down to 160lbs. Starting a bulk.

This is very interesting, and confusing as hell. I've been prescribing front squatting to everybody who gets a sore low back, but now this study shows that front squat has more erector spinae activity than a back squat. Of course there are other factors to consider than just activity but this hit home pretty hard. What do you think? I've used front squats on people with back pain pretty well, but now I've got to reconsider this idea.

Been lifting weights off and on for 22 years, my bench press is my best lift and still shows good promise of gains.  But what if I've been doing one little thing for 22 years that makes it harder to lift that bar because I've never had anyone to eyeball me. I hope that makes sense.

I do all the usuals, such as planks, side planks, l-sits (http://www.alkavadlo.com/2010/07/the-l-sit/), flag attempts (I hold in a ball and try to extend my legs, slow progress *sad face*). But I also take a lot of pole moves and break them down into drills that I work on. The two below can be done on a fireman pole at the playground, they are powder coated so offer more grip than chrome.

http://imgur.com/9JEPx

The first one is a basic V invert. You want the outside arm above the inside arm in a baseball grip. Engage you shoulder and back and lift yourself off the ground, this is to prevent you from kicking into the move. Then slowly raise your legs in a straddle. Keep lifting, slowly straighten your arm as you tilt your head back. Your goal is it teabag the sky. When lowering yourself back to vertical, make sure it is with a controlled movement so that your ribs do not bang against the pole. Hairline fractures are craptastic. Repeat as many times as you want, you do not need to touch the ground in between. Repeat on other side.


http://imgur.com/ossZi

This one is a shoulder mount. Warning:DO THIS AT  YOUR OWN RISK. Falling out of this one can kill you. I am using a double cup grip, my hands are too small to wrap around the pole so I""m limited on what I can use. There are many different grips you can use, play around until you are comfortable. The pressure of the arms pulling the pole into your shoulder is what is holding you up, so naturally, you will bruise. Start on tip toes, do not kick up, do not jump. Lift, slowly and controlled. When lowering yourself, uncurl your back first, legs come down LAST (unless you are a chinese pole dancer and are planning to flip off the pole). 


Edit: When these get easy, try holding still at various angles for a long as you can.

About 10 years ago, he tried the same thing on himself and was hooked on the idea immediately. I started it about a year ago and I am definitely stronger because of it. And I hate sounding like a salesman, but honest to god, its fun and the best part is its stress/injury/failure free! This also eliminates the idea of being ""stuck"" at the same weight (plateaus).

I've been googling around for a bit on some keywords, but I just keep running into blog and forum posts, with buzzwords and/or ads.

See, the things is... I've never really been able to do ""explosive"" in my exercises. I just seem to have a natural tendency to a slow and controlled pace, instead of speed (which is typically in tandem with no real focus on the eccentric phase).

As far as I can tell, the muscle fiber types are relevant to look at here. So, some of them will activate quickly, and others will activate not so quick. But what are we actually talking about, here? Are we saying that ""fast twitch"" fibres are better ""hit"" with explosive, rather than steady, reps? Is that even the right level to make that distinction at? ""Fast twitch for fast reps, slow twitch for slow""? I find that hard to believe... Fast twitch is supposed to *activate* fast, right? Meaning, they'll respond quicker to demand. Slow twitch just activates slower, but can keep going for longer. So *explosive* reps does exactly the same as slow reps, as long as the load is heavy enough?...

I guess the (my) bottom line is: how important is it to incorporate a focus on explosive concentric phase - maybe foregoing a focus on the eccentric phase as well - versus doing a regular rep, with almost equal attention to both phases?

The example, I suppose, is the deadlift. So, one person does the ""powerlift"" style, as fast as possible up, and not really caring about ""catching"" the bar going down. Another person does a slow lift - maybe because it's heavy - and slams the bar back down, like the ""powerlifter"". And then there's those like me, who go up slowly, and go back down slowly.

Can anyone help me with putting some *science* on this? There seems to be all sorts of takes on it ""out there"", and I can't find the proper resources (maybe I don't have the right keywords). But... Am I missing out? Are those other ones missing out?

**The Dumbbell Stopgap**

**Introduction**

It is almost universally accepted that the best way to get stronger or increase lean muscle mass is regular barbell training. Unfortunately, a huge number of gyms have begun avoiding barbells in favor of more cardio equipment. For many people, these watered-down, feel-good globogyms are the only available exercise facilities. Often, in what seems like no more than lip service to strength training, these gyms have racks of relatively light dumbbells for ""toning."" These are far from ideal as exercise implements, and both barbell training and bodyweight exercises are generally more useful for building strength.

If you have access to barbells and wish to weight train, [Starting Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738) is almost universally recommended. It also has [a wiki](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), but it is highly recommended you buy the book. It costs about as much as an average monthly gym membership and will teach you more about lifting than almost any other resource. Check out /r/weightroom for more resources and a wealth of user-generated content, some of which comes from current and/or former world record holders.

If you wish to train in bodyweight exercises, these are also an option. They are excellent for building static strength, maintaining weight while growing stronger, and learning basic and advanced body mechanics. For these, [Overcoming Gravity](http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120) and [Building the Gymnastic Body](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Gymnastic-Body-Gymnastics-Strength/dp/0982125305) are both excellent resources. Check out /r/bodyweightfitness for more resources and a wealth of user-generated content (including much information from Steven Low, the author of Overcoming Gravity). The only thing you really need for this is a bit of open space (but access to some sort of horizontal bar is highly helpful).

If you have the resources to build a home gym, that is an excellent option if your only other gym access is one of the aforementioned mediocre-to-bad gyms. [Stronglifts.com](http://stronglifts.com) (another beginner program akin to Starting Strength) has [a good writeup](http://stronglifts.com/home-gym-equipment-buyer-guide/) on what you will need or want to buy. This can take time, space, and money, but if you have those three things, you should definitely consider it. A home gym can start as simply as a single kettlebell or be as complex and specialized as a professional strongman's training facility. If you have a single kettlebell and a place to stand, you have enough of a home gym to get started down this route. Buy [Enter the Kettlebell](http://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Strength-Secret-Soviet-Supermen/dp/0938045695) and check out /r/kettlebell.

All that being said, if you are unable to do any of the above things for whatever reason, you can start training with dumbbells *UNTIL YOU CAN DO ONE OF THE ABOVE OPTIONS*. They are all preferable to dumbbell training for beginners.

**What this program is not**

This program is *not* for people with a single pair of fixed-weight dumbbells. This program is *not* an optimal way to get strong or build muscle mass. This program is *not* a long-term training program.

**What this program is**

As the name implies, this program is a stopgap until you can gain access to one of the above options. If you are motivated to grow stronger and want to do so immediately, this program will get you started before your motivation dries up as you wait for equipment or books. This program requires that you have access to a set of dumbbells (meaning a progression of dumbbells, usually at 2.5 or 5 lb intervals) or a pair of adjustable dumbbells. You will be working out 3 times a week.

You will probably look silly and do exercises that no one else in your gym is doing. This is okay. The only person judging you in the gym is yourself. If someone in the gym is looking at you funny or giving you dirty looks or even talking about you, they don't matter. You are in the gym to grow stronger and healthier. Anything else in the gym that doesn't contribute to these goals is meaningless.

**The Program**

There are 2 workouts: A and B. They will alternate with a one-day gap and have a 2-day gap every weekend. So on the first week, you will do Workout A on Monday, B on Wednesday, and A again on Friday (or whatever 3 days you have chosen). On the second week, you will do Workout B on Monday, A on Wednesday, and B again on Friday. And so on. Start with the lightest dumbbells available to you. These may seem incredibly easy or may be too heavy. If they are easy, start with them anyway so that you can learn proper form. As you increase the weight, the exercises will become more difficult. If the available dumbbells are too heavy, start doing the exercises with empty hands.

*Workout A*

[Bulgarian split squat](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat.html) or [Lunge](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBLunge.html)

[Floor press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XtEzJpPR2Zg)

*Workout B*

[Bulgarian split squat](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBSingleLegSplitSquat.html) or [Lunge](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/DBLunge.html)

[Seated shoulder press](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/DBShoulderPress.html) If you don't have access to a seat, sit on the floor with your legs outstretched (also called a Savickas Press). The latter is actually preferable, but I can't find a good guide to doing it.

[Plank](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWFrontPlank.html)

**Progression**

For each exercise but the plank, at the lightest weight available (or with empty hands), do as many repetitions (reps) as possible, up to 10. Do this three times (sets) before moving on to the next exercise. Rest for 1 minute between sets. When you can do an exercise for 3 sets of 10 reps each, increase the dumbbell weight by one step next time you do the exercise. You may progress very quickly using this method, but eventually it will take longer to increase the weight. This is okay. If you remain stuck at the same number of reps and the same dumbbell weight for 3 workouts, decrease the dumbbell weight by two steps and try progressing again.

For the plank, do 3 sets held as long as possible. If you can't do 3 sets when you start out, do as many sets as you can.

**Extra exercises**

If you have access to them, [dips](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWTriDip.html) and [pullups](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BWPullup.html) are used by both bodyweight strength trainees and weightlifters. They are excellent exercises and will greatly increase your strength. Do the same as above: 3 sets of as many reps as you can. These sets can go beyond 10 reps and still be effective, so do as many reps as you can 3 times. If you can do 3 sets of 10 reps, you will most likely be stronger than many people in your gym.

**What's next**

This program has a relatively short shelf life. It runs out when your available dumbbell weights run out. This should be long enough, however, to acquire books, information, and/or equipment to move on to one of the more effective programs mentioned above. If you receive or acquire enough equipment to end this program earlier and move on to more effective training methods, please do so as soon as possible. All of the programs mentioned above were made by experienced fitness professionals. This program was made by a random asshole, who is not a fitness professional, on the internet.

I got numbers for weight, height, time lifting, and powerlifting total. *Most* people filled out the information properly, although some left out various data. There were two things that came up a lot that I didn't account for: that people would put estimated maxes, or higher rep maxes, instead of what they've actually lifted, and that the answer to how long you've been lifting tends to be more complicated than just a number.

Anyway, enough talk. Here's some graphs featuring what I've learned.

[This is you](http://i.imgur.com/bQz4i.jpg)

[Heavier people tend to be stronger](http://i.imgur.com/RBLAu.jpg)

[Taller people tend to be heavier](http://i.imgur.com/SNZGh.jpg)

[People who have lifted for longer tend to be stronger, but this effect is most important when you are just starting out](http://i.imgur.com/QNDvZ.jpg)

What I initially wanted to look into was the relationship between height and strength. A paper analyzing olympic weightlifters found that strength went as height^2.18 , which is similar to what you'd expect from naive biophysics. Unfortunately...

[There is jack shit relationship between height and strength among this group of people](http://i.imgur.com/J0icV.jpg)

So, why did we not observe any relationship between height and strength? Well, without doing any actual statistics, there are a few reasons. I believe the most important is that the majority of people in this data set have been lifting for less than a year, and haven't had a chance to reach their full potential, or fall into their genetic rut, depending on how you look at it. I could try restricting the data to people who have been lifting for a certain amount of time, although that would cut out a lot of data. Another possibility is that powerlifting is not subject to the same scaling laws as weightlifting, or that the biomechanical disadvantages of being tall exactly outweigh their benefits. I could advertise at more forums to get more data, but I've done enough entry for now. I'd be happy to upload the data so others can analyse it.

I ride occasionally on the track, but my biggest portion of riding is done off road on trails, which can throw all sorts of terrain / situations at you over a very long period of time. Strength is key while riding for a number of reasons.. exploding over obstacles, handling the bike through tough terrain, picking it up when you crash, etc.

I'm looking for some exercises / workouts that would really benefit me. Here are some stats on myself and current training methods:

* 6'0'', 173lbs, 28 year old male
* Goal: To gain raw, explosive strength and high-performance endurance
* No injuries / health issues
* Training in the gym with standard weight lifting techniques / long distance running for the past 5 years or so
* Currently training on a customized Convict Conditioning routine
* Customized by adding in push / pull / sprints, extra core work, and runs of 4 - 6 miles once a week
* no special diet, just do what I call ""conscious eating"". Don't be fat :)

I know about things like squats, deadlifts, etc. Those are all great exercises. What I'm really hoping for are workouts that incorporate sprints, with body weight exercises. Something I can do 1-2x a week that will really push me to the next level! 

What I feel are my weaknesses:

* as for soreness, after a hard day of riding I'm sore in my quads from squatting with the suspension, my traps / upper back / shoulders from pulling up on the handle bars, and usually my forearms / grip from the throttle and lever work.

* I feel most of my weakness comes from my core. I fall fairly frequently in slow speed, technical sections and I think this relates directly to balance and core stability.

* If I fall a lot in a given day, I get gassed really easily from the simple act of picking up the bike. It weighs about 240lbs, so deadlifting it a few times in a row, on the side of sandy hill, really takes it out of me.

Incorporated some work on a Concept2 rower into my routine (turns out these are the rowers at my gym.. score!), and am planning on adding some plyometrics. And also.. riding more!

I have a couple of questions about how to progress along these lines:

(1) Is it possible to do too few reps? I notice that, over the last month or so, I haven't really been increasing my reps, but I have been able to do the reps more slowly. Especially the first rep. My question is; should I continue to focus on slowing down the repetitions, or is there a point at which I should be letting myself do them more quickly so I can get more reps in?

To use today as an example, I did 4 sets split up like this; 3/3/2/1. Now, I could easily do more than that if I weren't maxing myself out on the first rep of each set.

(2) I've been doing the negatives for about a month but I still seem to have trouble doing a chin up unassisted. I find that, if I start at a bit of an angle, I can do one. Is there anything I can do to help build up strength to give me that first push to get a rep started?

It's going well, and with the rehab being 3 months long, I'm about halfway done.

What I'm curious about is, has anyone rehabilitated a patellar tendinosis/opathy, then successfully gone back to heavy squatting? Do you have any suggestions regarding the process? Things that worked for you that you wished you had thought of earlier, techniques, etc.

Right now I'm doing a lot of soft tissue for the quads, ITB/TFL, hips and the entire lower body really. Additional strength work has included barbell glute bridges, band walks, EQI lunges/bodyweight squats. Other than the decline squats, they're the only exercises that don't light me up.

The Situation: My father over the past several years has seen a serious deterioration of his health and fitness. He was a carpenter by trade and has always been strong and active. He had a bum knee as a result of an ACL tear and several barbaric surgeries in 1969. About 9 months ago he went in for a total knee replacement. That surgery went really well but less than a week after he was back in the hospital for almost three months with MRSA and kidney failure. So he's been laid up for almost 9 months for recovery and he's done with rehab would like to get back to being strong. 

Stats:
Age- 62
Gender- Male
Weight- 200lbs
Height- 5'9""

Diet: Recently I convinced him to switch to a [paleo esque](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/) diet and he's made great progress towards being healthier. 

Facilities available: Senior center with weight area and full size pool. 

Goals: Improve quality of life by getting stronger and increasing activity levels. 

Injuries: Total Knee Replacement surgery in right knee. History of Shoulder injuries. Spotty Kidney function. 

My plan:

Swimming 2-4 days per week

Lifting 3 days/week

Was planning on doing a pretty high volume template for the first month or two to rehab and get the CNS used to being under load. I was planning on training primarily Dan John's basic human movements (squat, hinge, push, pull, loaded carry) 

Sample week:
Mon (Squat/Pull)

- 10x10 Barbell box squat to high box
- 5x10 One arm cable row
- 5x10 Band Pull aparts

Wed (Hinge/Press)

- 10x10 KB Swing
- 5x10 Landmine Press
- 5x10 Reverse Hyperextention

Fri (Squat/Loaded Carry/ Pull)

- 10x10 Goblet Box Squat
- 5x10 One arm Cable Row
- 5x 200m Farmers walk.

I've not worked extensively with older populations before and would love some help putting together the best plan for my dad to be badass again.

I love training and am totally addicted.
I have trained since ca 2002, running, weightlifting and surfing.
The last years I have begun to feel that when the energy is right, when I feel I have loads of explosive energy,
I can exceed my limits and train harder than my body actually wants to.

Sometimes I run 10-15km and come home and get feevers. I have also begun doing CrossFit, which pushes you to unknown heights and extremes, and the same things happens on occasion there too. I end up either sitting at the lab, shiverring and sweating, being pale and having a classical fever. If this happens more than once during a week, I get a cold that lasts for two weeks.

I have observed this from distance running, CrossFit and spinning, but not dormant and slack weightlifting.

I assume this has to do with my body producing the stress hormone cortisol, when I am training too hard. 

I know I should of course not push myself too hard, but I like the pain and can't tell when I'm overdoing it.
I only detect it afterwards, when I get a fever, by then its too late of course :). 
Mixing Ibuprofene and Paracetamol of course sets the fever nicely, but is hardly a proactive way of dealing with this.


Has anyone else had this as an issue? What did you do to get around it? Any tips for me?

Went to a few doctors in college whenever the pain got acute, but they'd just say ""muscle strain"" and give me AIs or relaxants.  When I started having another episode in the past few weeks, I scheduled an appointment with a *real* doctor, and after hearing my story and performing a few tests, he was pretty damn confident that I've got/had a herniated disk.

Perhaps my experience is old news, so I apologize ahead of time for wasting anyone's time. Last year, I did IF for two weeks and resumed regular meals 4 days before my marathon. I had a terrible time with the marathon and wondered if IF had anything to do with it or if I just didn’t train enough (or both).

**Setup**

No breakfast (other than unsweetened tea) and no lunch with a regular dinner for 2 days prior to bike ride. The night before the ride I ate a regular meal which was moderately low carb and some fruits (apples and oranges) and a taro dessert (taro root with coconut milk and some sugar) before bedtime. Breakfast was coffee with some whole milk, a biscotti, 2 raw eggs and a banana.

**Biking**

I was concerned my glycogen levels were low so I drank gatorade right before I started biking and throughout the ride. The bike ride was 30 miles and fairly hilly. In the past I would only drink water (with no prior IF) and would go into glycogen debt after 25 miles. This time I felt strong throughout the ride. My average speed was 14.8 mph (could’ve been faster but had to slow down for a friend).
 

**My Conclusion**

From my experience, I feel that carb loading isn’t necessary (I never believed it in the first place). A regular dinner meal the day before and consuming carbs during endurance activities are sufficient steps to avoid glycogen debt.

**Possible Counter Arguments and Flaws**

* I am in much better riding shape now.
* Having oranges, apples and taro dessert served as carb loading.
* A sample size of one is not sufficient for any conclusion.  The next step is biking right after 12 hours of fasting.

**Questions**

* Has anyone else experimented with IF and endurance exercises?
* I've read a few counter arguments against carb loading.  Is it still being practiced on the professional level?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_fuqhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/fuqhf/intermittent_fasting_and_endurance_training_biking/,

Then of course, there is the discussion about the training, where hopefully we all learn something we can apply to our own training, and help the originator with their program.

Now my stuff:

**Bodytype:** 6' 210lbs approx 14% bodyfat  *Note I don't have calipers yet so this is just a guess based on pictures of various bodyfats.

**Goals:** Right now I'm training with two main goals in mind; improving my speed and agility for my upcoming touch football season and dropping my bodyfat under 10%.  Of course, with these goals come the eternal goal of getting stronger, or at least maintaining my current strength. 

**Program:** I've split up my program into upper and lower body, attempting to gain the most strength in the lower body and mostly maintain in the upper.  Thus I stay at a lower rep range for my large lower body lifts while staying in a higher range for the upper body.

Squats x8 x5 x5 x5 x8

Side Bends x8 x8

Notes: The Squats and Deadlifts I do one warm up and one cooldown set (the sets for 8 reps) which a much lower weight focusing on form and explosiveness.  I feel this lets me ""remind"" my muscle memory of the proper form before I go heavy and ingrain it even once I'm fatigued.

I know [Tendo units](http://store.sorinex.com/Tendo-Power-Speed-Analyzer-p/t-4.htm) can do it, but they're prohibitively expensive and I currently don't need research-grade equipment so I was curious if there was a smartphone alternative.

I'm aware that there are several accelerometer apps that will provide raw data that can be analyzed on a workstation, but I'd prefer something a little more streamlined that could provide feedback in the gym if possible. [Deep Squat](http://www.pendlayforum.com/showthread.php?t=11984) comes close to what I'm thinking, but it only outputs time vs. thigh angle rather than velocity or acceleration vs. time. It's more interested in hip angle than bar speed, which isn't what I care about.

There are a number of potential issues with attaching the phone to the bar itself, such as potential for destroying the device due to extreme vibration/shock/crushing, but I think that risk can be at least partially mitigated through creative mounting of the device, but then one has to wonder if any play in the mounting would mess up the data collected, if the sensors in the phones are sufficiently accurate, are they susceptible to damage themselves, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 

Perhaps motion capture is a better option in terms of hardware survivability, but then you're looking at whether or not the device has usable frame rates, calibration every time you set up the camera, being limited to one or two angles, and so on.

So I'm throwing this out there to see if anyone knows of any inexpensive solutions for measuring bar speed and power.

I didn't train like this for the first race, and struggled to complete it. So, I thought that this time it would be smart to train with the gear.

During the first run of the first race I noticed a dull but building pain in my left ankle. Eventually it was throbbing and sharp. I brushed it off because we ended up running on gravel and sand. I placed blame on the alternating terrain. 

Yesterday I hopped on the treadmill with my pack which is roughly 12-15lbs and began to jog. Within the first half of a mile my left ankle began throbbing. I noticed that the pain was coming from the medial aspect. It's either below the tibia, or between the achilles and tibia - hard to tell. Because I could handle the pain I continued to run, when I stepped off the treadmill the pain completely dissipated. 

I understand that this sub isn't a doctor's office, and at this point I am simply looking for opinions. I've been bodybuilding and strength training for 6 years, so I feel that my muscle structure is good. I've ran a half marathon and felt no pain. I've ran several 5k races recently, again with no pain. Something happens when I put that pack on though. Any ideas?

tl;dr: Training for ~45 mile adventure race, also participating in bodybuilding/strength training for the past 6 years. When I run without my race gear, I feel fine.

I got back into running last year after having taken a while off, and I've been balancing it with taekwondo and schoolwork.  At the same time I was dieting to lose weight, and lost about 16 pounds.  

This semester, I'm planning on following [this routine](http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/racing/rws-garmin-ready-marathon-schedule-sub-300/2757.html) with a few modifications in order to achieve a sub-3-hour marathon time.   Traditionally, I've trained for 5ks, but my past pre-season training bears semblance to this plan, with the exception of long runs usually capped around 17 miles.  

I'm planning on losing weight during the process, obviously, but since I'm putting on a lot more distance than I have in a long time, I'll also need to make sure I'm eating enough, too.  Also, I'm practicing taekwondo multiple times per week and planning on doing light weight training twice a week.

*Are there any general or specific dieting guidelines I should bear in mind when losing weight when training for a marathon?*  

Last semester I had a relatively high intake of red meat, which, from what I've heard, isn't the best for running, but I haven't found any good sources on that.  Bacon was usually my go-to food after long runs since it was cheap, salty, easy to make, and full of protein. I also started to drink watered down Naked juice (smoothie?) instead of more sugary drinks.  Most of my pre-workout snacks were some variation of toast and honey.  

My target weight is 140 lbs, which is the weight I was at in my prime.

Also, *does anyone have any critiques of the particular plan I posted above? [Link again](http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/racing/rws-garmin-ready-marathon-schedule-sub-300/2757.html).*

So, I'm currently doing a modification of Madcow, and plan on continuing this for a while still, eking out some more strength gains after a little over half a year of beginner LPs (SS, then GSLP).  Though I love strength training, I initially went into it because it was a good investment for later mass building.  But since the initial goal was aesthetic, I have been giving thought to a bodybuilding program, which I may or may end up doing after this Madcow modification.  I was hoping to get some feedback.  Though the goal is to mass up, I also want to preserve strength, so there's some low volume high intensity work in there as well, especially for muscle groups that are largely fast-twitch fiber.  Program is influenced by the work of Menno Henselmans and Jim Stoppani, mostly.

I've got a 4-day and a 3-day version... the 3-day mostly just reorganizes the shoulder day into the chest and back days, cutting a few exercises.  Weight is dictated by the volume, heavier for low rep, lighter for high rep; still working out the details.  Here's the 4-day version:

**Day 1: Chest**

- Barbell Bench Press (low rep)
- Incline Dumbbell Bench Press (medium rep)
- Pronated Grip Cable Flyes (medium rep)
- Rolling or Overhead Tricep Extension (low rep)
- Body-weight Dips (high rep)

**Day 2: Back and Bicep**

- Bent Over Barbell Row (low rep)
- Kroc Row (high rep but heavy)
- Barbell Curl (medium rep)
- Hammer Curl (low rep)
- Chin-ups (medium rep)

**Day 3: Rest**

**Day 4: Shoulders**

- Barbell Overhead Press (low rep)
- Pronated Grip Rear Delt Raise (medium rep)
- Face Pulls (high rep)
- Barbell Shrugs (low rep)
- Neck Extension/Flexion (high rep)

**Day 5: Lower Body**

- Barbell Deadlift (low rep)
- Barbell Box Squat (medium rep)
- Barbell Squat (widowmaker: high rep)
- Barbell Calf Raise (high rep but heavy)
- Glute Ham Raise (medium rep) or Hamstring Curl if unavailable/can't

**Day 6/7: Rest**

For ab work, plank, rollout/walkout, reverse crunch, leg raise, cable crunch, choose one each workout day and do it if desired.

My concern is safety, balances in the shoulder girdle, and effectiveness (bang for your buck).  What are your initial thoughts?

**Leading up to the meet**

Personally, I kept things pretty simple, as mentioned above I water cycled a week out from the meet, and took the usual supplements:


* whey protein from myprotein.com
* creatine ethyl ester from myprotein.com
* fish oil from lamberts


I can't really take pre workout stims much, other than caffeine, given I compete in a tested sport/federation. I'm going to start taking choline as well after having read through some of these threads, and speaking to some other lifters such as jacques_chester.


**Competition Day** 


The morning I spent eating and drinking nothing, to be sure I weighed in as light as possible. Once weigh-in was done, I took my normal supplements, but also took a Dioralyte sachet with my powerade to help re-hydrate me before going to the warm up room. 


Nutrition basically consisted of a load of white pasta, LOTS and LOTS of powerade and red bull in the warmup room, and sweet sweet chocolate biscuits. 


**The point of this post ...** 

Basically, what do other competitive weightlifters / powerlifters do with regards to nutrition and supplementation pre and during meets?

I'm wondering if there are things that aren't quite stimulants but are similar to the idea of choline that are meant to help focus etc, that are worth taking during a competition, that kind of idea.

I'm looking for some advice on combating overhydration in preparation for a race over the course of the next week. I know it's kind of an odd thing to encounter as most runners tend to worry about dehydration, but I'm fairly sure that I fall into the former category:

1) It's not uncommon for me to drop in excess of 2% of bodyweight on a quick 5k training run.

2) I often find my self unable to physically drink more, but still incredibly thirsty.

3) It's not uncommon for me to urinate 3+ times throughout the night.

*ETA: I've recently been to a doctor and had blood work done; I am not diabetic, and my kidney function is normal. Thanks for the concern though, it's a very valid point.*

4) I've recently been cramping very quickly, though I have no perceivable form issues and I am plenty hydrated pre-run.

It was a very easy situation to overlook until this point. I started drinking an excess of water while weight training, because of the noticeable affects slight dehydration had on my strength over the course of a workout. Compound that with an aversion to processed foods and sports drinks, and I have found myself with what I'm guessing is an electrolyte imbalance. In hindsight, I've fallen into a cycle where I train, dump an incredible amount of water weight, then binge on water to force re-hydration (also because of what I perceive to be a never-ending thirst). As a result, everytime I go out for a longer run my body immediately dumps all of my water reserves. In cooler weather, I initially attributed the strain on my body to a lack of conditioning and pushed through. However, as the heat has intensified, that's just not possible. Once I started actually measuring water loss over the course of a run, I realized I had a problem.

In a nutshell, I'm looking for a strategy to increase water retention over the course of the next week in hopes of combating this behavior.

My plan is the following:

1) Scale back water intake significantly.

2) Up my sodium and potassium intake.

3) Cut out stimulants/diuretics (ie: caffeine).

4) Eat a sodium/carb heavy meal the night before the event in hopes of increasing water retention (followed by a modest liquid meal/banana the next morning).

I've also do most of my running in the early afternoon (hottest part of the day), whereas the event is in the early morning; hopefully that will provide some sort of cushion.

I'd appreciate any other advice, as this is a relatively new area for me.

Ok, so here's my problem or anomaly if you will.  My squat weight and dl weight are virtually the same with 5X5 at 115lbs.  I squat below parallel with good form - my trainer and I have been working extensively on this.  My DL form isn't bad but apparently I have a tendency to round my shoulders.

Everything I've read suggests that my DL weight should be quite a bit higher than my squat.  My trainer's response was, ""sometimes our bodies do weird things that can't be explained."" but he's also acknowledged that I'm his only client like this and that it's unusual.

I find I have big issues with grip on my DLs although experimenting yesterday, I found a better way to hold the bar such that my hands aren't on fire when I'm doing my DLs.  This didn't allow me to increase my weight though.

Me:
Girl, 34, 5""10, 190ish?, lifting for 12 months or so.

I have an old hip injury but it doesn't really seem to hold me back from anything so I don't think that's the problem.

Has anyone experienced this problem?  It's been pretty much neck and neck for the weight the entire time I've been lifting.  I'm not necessarily concerned *per se* but if there's something specific that I can do to make me more ""normal,"" I'd be all over that.

Or maybe this is just a case of me being a total weirdo in yet another aspect of my life.

Edit:  thanks a lot for all of your comments.  I'll be trying some new things the next time I lift.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_hli9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/hli9k/my_squatdl_anomaly/,

I have not been training fasted, but in the evening after 1-2 meals.  During this time I've developed some interesting symptoms immediately after completing some, but not all, powerclean reps regardless of weight, namely:

* Lightheadedness
* Blurry, tunnel vision
* Auditory distortion, especially the sensation that music is markedly slowed
* Twitching of hands/arms/face/neck
* Sensation of almost losing conciousness

""No big deal,"" I thought, ""just some orthostatic hypotension.""  I would grab onto the rack or sit down if it warranted it and continue my set when I was ready.

Well, this morning I did some unscheduled, fasted, power snatch practice.  I'm just learning the lift and it was a relatiely light weight.  I worked up to a single at 105lbs, decided to call it a day, and power cleaned the weight to put it back in the rack.  I promptly passed the fuck out, and woke up a few minutes later extremely confused and lying on my back.

First thought was hypoglycemia in addition to the postural hypotension, but a quick check of my blood glucose using an ex-girlfriends glucose monitor revealed a level of 95.

Am I correct in assuming that this is, in fact, orthostatic hypotension?  I would appreciate if anyone has any advice or thoughts they care to share on the subject.  I've found little on the internet with regards to a link between the two.  Though interestingly, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension#Other_risk_factors) mentions a link between anorexia/bulimia and orthostatic hypotension.

At any rate, I guess I'm going to abandon the intermittent fasting and go back to a more frequent meal plan, for various reasons, but I would still like to hear some opinions on the matter.

* Height: 6'1""

* Some minor soft-tissue back injuries, nothing too serious

After stressing over whether I was “ready” for 5/3/1 or not, I decided *fuck it* and went for it. There were many [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/h3cax/beginning_wendlers_531_with_the_bbb_template_i/) that thought I’d be better off continuing Starting Strength or some variation of it, but I wanted a break from the ‘Toe. I did heed the advice of those that said I wouldn’t be squatting enough and made sure to add front squats to my deadlift days as an accessory lift.

First, let me just say that I kinda love the 5/3/1 philosophy and programming. It keeps you banging out heavy ass weights, but provides the flexibility to let your inner bro curl till his heart’s content. I don’t have much “use” for my strength; I don’t play sports, work a physically demanding job, or have a family to protect from zombie outbreaks. Therefore, aesthetics are important to me. 5/3/1 with its customizable assistance allows for that focus with the prescribed volume. I wanna get stronger, of course, but I also wanna *look* like I’m strong.
  
-----------------------
**The Results: It Went *Okay***

* Weight: 158 / 167 ~ +9

*Cycle 1 vs. Cycle 3 estimated 1RMs using Wendler's formula (Weight x Reps x .0333 + Weight = Estimated 1RM).*

* Squat: 268 / 275 ~ +7

* Bench Press: 185 / 192 ~ +7

* Deadlift: 327 / 335 ~ +8

* OHP: 134 / 129 ~ -5 &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  

As for my results, well, they’re a touch disappointing actually. I did take ""before"" photos, but there wasn't a big change after the third cycle so I put off taking ""afters"" until the 6th cycle, maybe. I definitely got stronger in the big lifts, but not by a shitload. The squat still gives me trouble despite working my balls off on it. My bench took a big hit from an annoying injury that set me back big-time. My deadlift is the only thing continuing to rise steadily, but I fear that’s coming to an end soon. The OHP? Well, fuck the OHP. I don’t even wanna talk about it. I’m kidding, but as you can see, it’s not progressing very much. 

But fuck it, I’m gonna press on (pun 50% intended) and keep working.

**The Routine: 5/3/1 with Boring But Big assistance work**

I’ve broken down the workout into the 4 days and listed my progress on the main lifts and my current accessory routine.

* Warm-up: 15-45 minutes on the elliptical depending on time available and how fat I feel based on the weeks nutrition. I do this just about every session.

* Post-workout cardio/conditioning: running, interval sprints (on a powered-off treadmill), or stair-climber. I do one of these depending on how much energy and time I have leftover.

**Questions**

I’d really love some help optimizing my accessory work. I know there’s gotta be some inefficient, over-done, or useless shit going on.

1. I’m looking to replace the Hip-thrusters on Squat day. They’re a bitch to set up and I have to rearrange the whole gym in order to stay out of everyone’s way when I do them. Also, I think my form is off because they don’t *feel right*. I already do plenty of RDLs on deadlift day, and my gym doesn’t have anywhere to do GHRs. Is there another ass-blasting, glute/ham exercise I can do to assist my squat?

2. Ab wheel rollouts: kneeling's pretty easy, even at 5 sets of high reps, but standing's still pretty impossible. Is there something in between you'd recommend?

3. I do Incline Dumbbell Bench Presses for 5x10 pretty much just because Wendler says “when in doubt, do 5x10.” Am I wasting my time with that much volume on these? I have to use pretty light weight to get the full 5x10 in, and I often have to decrease the weight across the sets. Should I be doing 3x10, 3x8, or 5x8 maybe? The goal with these is to push my pressing numbers, both bench and OHP. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't want a bigger chest. Also, is there any reason to be doing these with short rest intervals? I kinda just got into the habit of doing that with all the 5x10 accessory work.

4. Power Shrugs: I made up this rep scheme off the top of my head:     1-2 light-weight warm-up sets; 3 heavy sets; high-rep (~20); 1-3 more sets at about 75% for added volume; 1-2 sets of overhead shrugs with just the bar. I'm pretty sure it's way more than enough, but I'm not sure what to eliminate. Everyone seems to say heavy and high-rep are keys for the back, but I really want 'dem swole traps, hence the extra volume.

5. Front Squat: I've been doing these at 5x10, but I'm gonna increase the weight and lower the volume now that I have the technique down. Considering they're still being used for a quad-specific assistance, though, any advice on rep scheme? 3x8? 5x5? Something else?

6. Pull-ups: I've been super-setting these with dips, and it's a bitch. Is there any benefit to torturing myself like that?

7. Dips: What the hell happened to my dips? I used to be able to bang out over 10 reps with 45 lbs of added weight, but now I'm lucky if I can get 15 at bodyweight for more than a set. I do these on OHP day, maybe the volume of pressing is draining my triceps? I also had to stop doing dips entirely when I strained my pec minor back during cycle 2. Maybe I'm subconsciously nursing it and keeping myself from exerting max effort.

**Diet &amp; Supplements - 24 / Male / 5'11 / 162lbs** (in case you forgot)

Despite my best efforts, I put on some fat during these 3 cycles of 5/3/1. I usually kept the rest day nutrition pretty strict, but I often blew every calorie and macro goal on workout days which is what caused the gain I'm sure. You've not known gluttony until you've demolished a jar of peanut butter with a pound of pretzels--*after* your post-workout feast.

The Refreshed Plan:

Notes:

* LeanGains IF.

* Mostly vegetarian diet. In the past I kept it pretty strict, allowing just occasional fish, but now I'm gonna relax a bit and eat meat as long as I don't have to go out of my way to do it. I'm still not gonna make it part of my shopping list or daily menu, though.

Rest Days:

* Calories: 1500-2000

* Macros: &gt;150g protein / &lt;40g carbs / fat to fill calories

* Carbs are all “incidental,” meaning no carb sources aside from veggies

Workout Days:

* Calories: 2000-2500

* Macros: &gt;150g protein / 50-100g carbs / fat to fill calories

* I'm going to limit the carb intake to post-workout and incidentals only and resume my rest day nutrition a few hours after my post-workout meal. I used to maintain a higher carb intake throughout workout days, but I'm gonna try and change that.

* Sugar once a week on a cheat day.


I'm a little concerned about the total calories on workout days. 2000-2500 seems a tad low, but then again, I have a tendency to Just. Fucking. Eat. after I lift. Maybe the lower goal will help cancel out some of the damage I'm liable to do.

**Supplements**

* BCAAs for fasted training

* Jack3d pre-workout

* Creatine

* EC stack 3x per day

* Yohimbine HCL during fasted cardio

* Fish Oil

* ON Whey

* ON Casein

* Fiber (Metamucil, psyllium husk powder)

* Fucoxanthine

* Vitamin D

* Multi-vitamin

I got a few reasonably good ones but none that really explained the WHY or WHY NOT of what I am asking.

-------

I've been doing a bodyweight strength training routine for the last three months. I've read several books on the subject (Convict Conditioning, Naked Warrior, You Are Your Own Gym, etc.) and I've been making great progress.


As I've progressed, I've been diversifying my routine and learning more about human anatomy, what exercises hit what muscles, etc. And I had a couple questions that I couldn't find definitive answers to.


(1) Vertical (Overhead) versus Horizontal
How important is it to have both a vertical (overhead press, pull up) and horizontal (push up, bodyweight row) exercise for both pulling and pushing? Will pull ups suffice or should I always have a horizontal rowing movement too?


(2) Wide grip versus Shoulder width versus Close grip
I know that a close grip on either pushups or pullups tends to focus on triceps, whereas a wide grip focuses more on the chest. How important is it to use multiple grips with push ups, pull ups, rows, etc.?


I ask because, if all of the above is important, I have 12 different exercises (3 grips * 2 pulling * 2 pushing) I would need to do to get a well rounded upper body routine, and that seems like an awful lot. I'm curious what people think about this.",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_ibwjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/ibwjw/question_on_push_uppull_up_variations/,

I think it was part of a series of tips, so I can't source it. Googling turned up nothing.

Anyway here it is: Atleast once a month, set aside some time to do an exercise that you hate.

Let me ward off the idiots here.

** If you ""hate"" an exercise because it aggravates an injury, then stay the fuck away from that exercise. That's not what I'm talking about here **

** Don't do it half-assed, because that's almost as bad as not doing it at all **

We all have an exercise that we hate because we're not good at it. Some people enjoy running sprints but hate running longer distances. Some people like pullups but hate chinups. Some people enjoy squats but hate lunges.

My personal enemy is stairs. Fuck stairs. Stair sprints kill me.

But atleast once a month, I do stair sprints until my legs are shaking too hard to climb another step.

When I did them today, they felt a bit easier and I didn't hate them as much. I think I have one more cycle left before I have to find a new hate-ercise. Probably walking lunges. Ugh.

There are two reasons for doing this.

1) You probably hate the exercise because it's not your strong point. Therefore, by doing it, you are more often than not working on a weak point in your fitness.

2) Assuming you push the intensity in your regular workouts, you're usually fighting against exhaustion. But on this day, you will fight exhaustion while simultaneously telling yourself ""why the fuck am I doing this? I don't even like this exercise."" every step of the way. Think of it as a PR attempt for your willpower.

I've oddly found it bolsters my willpower over the next couple of days instead of draining it as I expected. I thought I'd have used up my willpower forcing myself to do stairs and would end up fucking up my diet, but whenever I do it, I find it easy to stick to my diet on that day and the next few because I stare down the fucking donut and say, ""You got nothing on me you pathetic sugar loaded whore. I'm the fucking CONQUEROR OF STAIRS, and no donut shall stand in the way of my glory"" and then walk away.

Anywho, I'm very stupid in the gym. Even during injuries I still hit the gym, albeit with a new routine to help the injured muscle group recover. Given how the typical advice given around is to rest up and ice it, this advice falls on empty ears when it comes to self-admitted stupid people like myself who will not rest.

Thus, the topic of this thread is what injuries you have had in the past, and how you modified your routine to work around them while rehabilitating it. Bonus points if you're able to notice whether rehab was not delayed at all, or whether gym belligerence delayed full healing.

To start, I recently suffered from a shoulder injury from a combination of anterior tilt and reduced thoracic mobility (as of right now that is what it seems to be). To heal this (and it is almost completely healed).

- Started every pushing workout with scapular retraction and thoracic mobility work (rear delt rows, overhead squats, and my new favorite of a squat-to-stand with reach)

- Changed all chest exercises to Bridge Press, as it seems the declined nature of it alleviates some of the pain induced from lack of thoracic mobility, and pushing my back into the ground with heavy weights physically tenses the upper back muscles for added support.

- Shoulder exercises were light-weight BTN presses (after sufficient warmup) as it opened up my torso and alleviate a ton of pain. Afterwards some lat raises were put in with an elbow bend (as the elbow bend seems to prevent my rolling my shoulder forward).

I was able to prevent much mass loss from my delts, and was able to push my bridge press from 315x1 to 385x2 (and 315x12) in a 2 month span and only slightly impaired the rate of recovery.

1295305631.0,7,self.AdvancedFitness,f42ng,Do you struggle with nerves/anxiety/stress during or before performance? Try this...,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f42ng/do_you_struggle_with_nervesanxietystress_during/,"A certain amount of stress/anxiety is normal, and actually beneficial. However, it follows the law of diminishing returns, and after the peak on the normal curve your performance starts going downhill. How can you avoid this impacting your performance? By learning to relax and be in the moment. Here’s how: 

Find a comfortable position. Lying down with your eyes closed is a good way to start. Place one hand on your chest, the other over your belly-button. Take a deep breath. If you’re doing this properly, your lower hand (the one on your belly button) should raise first. We’re focusing on filling your lungs from the bottom out. Your stomach should raise first, but DO NOT THRUST IT OUT. Allow your breath to come naturally. Take a minute to get it right. 

For general relaxation: progressive muscle relaxation or autogenics. Check out CSU’s stress management page. You can download these podcasts to iTunes for FREE. They are podcasts 1 and 2 in the second grouping (the first grouping also has several shorter podcasts that can help you with a variety of other things). Pick one of these and do 3x/week at least. It will take 2-3 weeks to feel like you have a real handle on it, but your stress WILL go down.

For performance: focusing on success guided imagery. You too should learn the basic relaxation techniques described above, but you can add to it by adding guided imagery. What this does is helps focus your brain on how you WANT your performance to go, which increases the likelihood of it actually happening. Here is an example that you can tailor to your specific sport (I’ll use running as it’s my sport). Obviously this is written for clarity for you all, but there are a number of pre-recorded imagery exercises you can find via the google, or you can make your own to listen to while you train:

Find a comfortable position, close your eyes and steady your breathing (described above). Picture yourself running. Your form is perfect, and your stride feels effortless. Feel how comfortable it is to be out there running. The breeze is gently blowing, and the temperature is perfect. You are easily hitting your goal pace, and you feel strong. Your footfalls are light and soft, your breath is steady and even. You notice the other runners around you, but they have no impact on how you feel. You are calm, and collected. Focused, and relaxed. You see your rival up ahead. He looks like he is running strong, but this does not faze you. You feel yet stronger. It seems like nothing to increase your pace. Your breathing comes faster and harder, but this does not concern you. You have trained for this, and your muscles are ready. The finish line is approaching, and you see that you are catching your rival. Your breath comes even faster now and you feel a burn in your legs. This is normal. You are in control. The pain you feel is a natural effect of your effort, and not worth coming into your awareness. You have the strength to continue through the pain, and this in turn makes you feel powerful. You surge past your opponent, assured in your victory. You legs stay steady, your mind focused as you cross the line.

[this was just a quick thing I came up with on the fly – there are way longer, more in depth imagery exercises out there]

Basically, I am a rock climber and I seem to be hitting a plateau.

I have also been into bodybuilding style lifting for a year or so now and I have made some good gains aesthetically, but my 1RM on many lifts hasn't increased much. I have recently begun some olympic and powerlifting style training (Cleans, deadlift, etc.) at lower rep ranges and have seen some decent gains in that regard. Whenever I tell fellow climbers about this, however, they discourage it, saying I will pack on to much muscle mass in unneeded areas. Most of the good climbers I know are skinny guys who do lots of isometric ab work and high rep calisthenics. I am a stockier 5' 8"" and 180lbs but still rather lean. I have heard that high rep ranges in lifting pack on more muscle mass, which is what I don't want, but wouldn't they also increase endurance needed for climbing?  I suppose the real questions I have are:

Is it possible to reconcile my climbing training and lifting(Can I keep lifting without gaining unnecessary mass)?

If so, what lifts should I be focusing on and what is the ideal rep range?

All responses are appreciated, especially if you are a climber with some experience in these matters.

My apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. I thought that this would be of more interest to you folks than the general fitness reddit though. 

I'll freely admit I'm a nerd with too much time on my hands.

Anyway, I was playing around with a spreadsheet to model my body composition in three scenarios: a LG bulk, cut, and recomp, basically to get a sense of what time frames I can expect results. I'm under some time limits- in one month, I'm competing in my school's powerlifting competition, and would like to be in a certain weight class. 

I ran into a problem- I have no idea what calorie partitioning I can expect from leangains.

Using my past anecdotal experience on myself, I just about have a 1:1 muscle/fat gain/loss on traditional calorie over/under consumption relative to maintenance. 

**Core question: Is a 2:1 ratio a bad assumption to make for lean gains? I.e, in the case of a bulk, +3 lbs of BW is +2 LBM, +1 BF (vice versa for hypocaloric intake?)?**

Anyway, I've uploaded my spreadsheet here: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjURynmhhnbFdGdxWmh2djdhd2g3Z2pPZm5Fd1lyRVE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0

Hope it makes sense. 

* First row is starting point. Feel free to change to your specs

* The ""Deficit"" column is dependent on the protocol I'm modeling. I.e. Bulk = maintenance on rest days, +500 kcals training days. Maintenance calculated from Harris Benedict formula, 1.375 activity modifier. Deficit itself calculated from body fat and the 31 kcals/lb of BF max advisible deficit that I've read around here somewhere. 
* LBM and BF columns iterate on previous entry and are changed based on calorie consumption the day before
* The partitioning assumption is built into the LBM and BF rules (the ""if"" clause- if I lifted the day before, I have this partitioning.)


My apologies again if this is hard to follow- I'm a biochem student, and am completely self-taught for excel. 

EDIT- I think you can only edit the file after downloading. As for the starting values, yep- I'm male, 5'6"", 125 lbs, and ~15% BF judging by the BF Friday thread. Skinny-fattest person on the planet, essentially. 

Some other questions/observations:

* According to this model, there's hardly any difference between the recomp and the cutting protocol in terms of body fat % progress (~13% difference in 6 months), but presumably far better lifting performance and LBM retention in the recomp scenario. Is my excel setup totally off here?


__________________________________________

EDIT- update. I dug up the [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838532/?tool=pubmed) behind the BW simulator posted on r/fitness that inspired this, and basically, my model is laughably simplified. There are no fewer than eight complex differential equations encompassing a ton of factors going into body composition changes (and these are probably just the tip of the iceberg). It's going to be ... tricky modeling these in excel.

My main point of inquiry regarding this article isn't whether we have in fact reached the 'peak' of physical performance, but whether or not that actually matters in any truly substantive way. The article seems to place emphasis that if records don't continue to be broken then people will get bored. While this is most likely true, I'm just wondering if this notion of 'peaked performance' has any applicability to the 99.9999% of the population that isn't a world-class athlete. 

If anything I'd suggest that by implying that we're at the limits of human performance chances are it will discourage more than encourage. I imagine the members of a board such as this will pay little notice to what is regarded as the limits of total human performance, preferring to focus on their own limits as an individual, I can help but worry that this could add more fuel to the ever growing 'why bother with fitness' fire.

Regardless, my questions are thus:

* Do you believe that we have (or will) reach a 'peak performance'?
* If so, do you see it affecting those not at 'the peak'?
* If not, why not (to both questions)?
* What then is the role of performance enhancing drugs in continuing to push the limits of human performance?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,False,,,True,t3_itre7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/itre7/peaked_performance/,

* [Vasomodulation of skeletal muscle BOLD signal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941631) ""Histamine is a known potent vasodilator of precapillary arterioles, and contributes to elevated capillary permeability. In addition, vigorous physical exercise has been shown to damage the fine structure of skeletal muscle, resulting in an increase in tissue-derived blood histamine. Further, it has been suggested that the resultant histamine induces muscular pain and vasodilation. Administration of an antihistamine, such as chlorpheniramine, may reduce the ability of the muscle microvasculature to dilate in response to exercise. This was confirmed in our studies (Table 2). An evaluation of the percent BOLD signal change suggested that antihistamine may even be detrimental to the effectiveness of soleus muscle contraction (Table 1).""

With the exception of maybe the last study, all of these looked at endurance exercise and not strength training. However, looking through my old training logs, it looks like my biggest gains occurred during the fall and winter, times when I don't need to take any antihistamines. Granted, I only have a few data points there, so that doesn't necessarily mean anything... Still, I feel like the writing is on the wall.

Crossposting this from weight room, cause this may be better suited for it.

I'm 6'2"" 175lbs, long limbs short torso

I was planning on restarting a linear progression really soon, so I decided to film my lifts this week and check for form problems. I turns out Press is a nightmare. I realized I've had an extreme hypermobility of my knees my entire life, but never had much cause to give it much thought until recently when I started OHPing heavy. The picture is what lockout looks like for me. It's important to note that this happens most when I tighten my entire body to lockout the press.

I went to an orthopedist today, he took xrays, told me my knees and ligaments are perfectly healthy, and that I was just born with hyper mobile knees and told me to lower the weight if it starts to hurt and that there was no problem. I convinced him to write my a script to a PT specializing in sports medicine, because I think he was an idiot. He also said there was no reason I shouldn't keep squatting/deadlifting. I have a forward pelvic tilt and tight hamstrings, and when I mentioned this to the orthopedist he told me the mobility would likely be worse If I try to foam roll/loosen them.

Does anyone have any experience/idea about this. I feel really hesitant to OHP at all, and I'm fairly sure this is affecting other lifts/posture/health/overall mobility.

The other most common position is playing guard. This is basically lying on your back on the ground in a squat-esk position with your feet on your opponent. Greater hip mobility is crucial in this position.

* Power lifting since 16
* 1RM's Bench: 380 Squat: 500 Clean: 265 (haven't done this in ages) Split-Jerk: 315 Snatch: 185 (also haven't done this in ages)
* Before every workout a 7 minute *warm up* is done on the bike, along with 3x10 neutral grip pull-ups
* Training to get stronger all around, my goals for my 1RM: Bench: 500, Squat: 650, and 405 Split Jerk. I don't do cleans or Snatch enough to have a reasonable goal set.
* Muscle progression will be achieved by increasing lowest tier weight by 5-10lb's subsequent workout, until the routine is no longer perceivable. i.e. I wont be able to keep up with the sets and reps, in which case I will stay at the baseline weight of the prior workout given the respective muscle group, until I can progress on the subsequent workout. 
* I plan on staying on this routine for 3-6 months. 
* I Take HemoVex as my Pre-workout, and *used* to take hydrolyzed whey protein, however I am off the protein now.
* I am afraid My routine's are too similar to really develop the muscle growth that I desire, hence why I am posting all the details here, for advice and criticism. 
* My diet is my most inconsistent part of my life, however I eat relatively healthy staying away from processed foods, and unnecessary late night eating. I did lose ~80lb's up until I started my first routine, but now am stagnate at 260lb's with my body becoming much more muscular and vascular, however my weight stays constant as I replace fat with muscle. 

Routine up until 11/19/12
---------
* Day 1 Chest/Back
     * Chest: Barbell Incline/Flat, Incline Fly's, Isolated Pushups, Dumbbell incline/flat
     * Back: Seated front pull downs, Bent Over Row’s, Seated Rows, Reverse Cable Fly's, T-bar rows
* Day 2 ""Leg Day""
      * Parallel squat, Hack Squats, Reverse Hack Squats, Leg Press, RDL's, Good Mornings, Bosu Ball Squats (50-100 reps no weight)
* Day 3 ""Arms""
      * Bi's: Close/Wide grip EZ bar curls, Preacher Curls, Hammer Curls, Cable straight bar curls Close/Wide grip
      * Tri's: Tri pull down, Reverse Tri pull down, seated tri extension, Dips, Non-assisted Dips, standing tri extension, Skull Crushers
* Day 4 Cardio/Shoulders
       * Shoulders: Split Jerks, Military press, Push Press, dumbbell Shrugs, Snatch Pulls

Rinse &amp; Repeat starting with your least sore muscle group. 
Every lift was done in 4 X 10-12 where the last rep you would be at failure and every set the weight would increase.  

Routine 11/20/12
-------
This is more a ""traditional"" lift schedule that I'm used to given my background in sports. I used to workout in this manner all throughout high school and most of college. 

All Exercises are done 5 x 12, 10, 10, 8, 15-20 where the last set is a *burnout* and the participant should fail at 15 and be able to push through to 20 with assistance, or if no partner is present fail at 20.

* Day 1 Chest/Tri's
     * Chest: Barbell Incline/Flat, Seated Incline Press, Incline Fly’s, Flat bench Fly’s, Dumbbell incline/flat
     * Tri’s: Reverse and Normal Pull-down, Skull Crushers, Extended Skull crushers, Dips, Weighted Dips
* Day 2 Back/Bi
     * Back: Seated front pull downs, Bent Over Row’s, Seated Rows, Wide grip pull-ups, T-bar row, One legged dumbbell raises with knee on the bench ( We call them lawnmowers )
     * Bi’s : Close/Wide grip EZ bar curls, Preacher Curls, Hammer Curls, Standing Cable alternating one arm curls, Iso-kinetic dumbbell curls holding offhand at 90 degrees
* Day 3 Legs
     * Parallel squat, Hack Squats, Reverse Hack Squats, Leg Press, RDL's, overhead squats, Barbell Lunges, Box Jumps
* Day 4 Shoulders/Cardio
     * Push Press, Split Jerks, Seated military Press, Dumbbell Shrugs, Snatch pulls, Smith Machine Shrugs
Rinse and Repeat always in the given order.

I'm getting cravings and trying to get through a weight loss plateau.",5,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/lmpee/can_someone_please_explain_what_is_happening_and/,"So some background: I lifted and (clean) bulked for 2 years (not consistently) while I was already fat. I did Starting Strength. I then didn't do anything for about two years, and lost around 20lb (I'm thinking mostly muscle since I didn't get any skinnier). I started being active again in May, but this time, I was cutting without lifting. I've been doing this ever since, and my weight has dropped by 50lb.  
  
Now, ever since the last week of September, I've been going back and forth between 192 and 195. I decided I plateaued last week (around the 10th). I changed my HIIT to be more intense (before it was 30 sec burpee, 10 sec rest, 15 sec jumping jack, 5 sec rest) (now it is 20 sec burpee w/ pushup, 10 sec rest), I started drinking a lot more water, and I upped my calories (ever since school started in beginning of Sept, I was getting about 1500-1800 calories a day, and now I get about 2000 calories on weekdays and around 2500 on weekends).  
  
On workout days (m/w/f), I'll try to have more fruit in the morning, and the meal after the post workout shake, I'll have something hi GI (like pasta or rice or quinoa). I do the burpees on tu/th/sa, nothing really special diet wise, I just go for fats instead of carbs, though my only carb sources during the weekdays (other than the post workout meal) is from fruit, milk, and vegetables (and dextrose/maltodextrin from the pwo).     
  
My diet consists of eggs,chicken,tuna,salmon,cottage cheese,whey,casein,fruits (banana,apple,orange,berries),vegetables (broccoli, carrots, red pepper, green pepper, spinach),milk(whole),nuts (walnuts, pistachios, almond butter, cashew butter, peanut butter),oils (fish, flax, safflower, olive),whole wheat bread,whole wheat pasta,brown rice,oats,quinoa,sweet potato  
  
Ever since I started lifting while cutting, I just always feel hungry. I've been incorporating a cheat meal on Friday and Saturday, because I've randomly heard that screwing with your diet/metabolism is actually good, and it refuels on carbs, but mainly because I've just been having super intense cravings. I've been mismatching the calories per meal as well (It might be like 400,200,200,670,180,350). I've never had cravings like this at all. It feels like a whole new level. While I was cutting, it was like ""ok, that food looks tasty, but I'm fine over here"", but now it just enters my head like it's a drug or something. I'm still able to control it (mostly, save for the cheat meal). I had half of a large BBQ chicken calzone one day, and before when I ate this, I'd be full for a while, but I was still hungry and felt like I could eat an additional 75% of a large. And I was hungry enough for a meal again 2 hours afterwords. It's like perma munchies.  
  
  
According to calculators online, my maintenance level is around 2900 calories. So according to that, I've only gone over that on 1 day in the past 2 weeks. Generally, on the days with cheat meals, I eat at around 2400-2600. According to the scale, I'm still the same weight, though who knows because maybe I was just dehydrated/unfueled before and now that I drink way more water and eat carbs more often I'm not?

I was cruising through T-Nation's [livespill](http://www.t-nation.com/strength-training-topics/1231) today about John and Dave's leg day, which made me a bit antsy to work out. One of the exercises was [modified front squats on a smith machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tixCGyVDzhE&amp;feature=player_embedded), which made a lot of red flags go up in my mind. However, in watching the video I cannot see any time in which the spine is compromised. Its almost as it this is a legitimate exercise (a modification of sissy squats).

This made me think a bit. The hivemind in fittit is usually 'The smith machine is only good for hanging belts on to *All praise Rippetoe*' when it comes to this machine; however, there has to be *some* good reasons for it.

Personally, I have found (from a bodybuilding perspective) that seated behind the neck presses *if not done to lockout* are great on the smith machine. The lockout denotes some forward:back motion which the smith machine denies, but if you only keep in the 'head' range (which the delts mediate anyways) its a great way to keep pressure on the delts and overload them without worrying about hitting your head with the bar.

Also, I found before that you can do some great pin presses in the smith with the hips *off* the bench. As when you push you and require the arms to arc over your head, you simply drop your hips. Its like a cheat bench where your glutes can get recruited highly and is quite safe given the smith has those safety clips.

1294859685.0,6,self.AdvancedFitness,f120m,[Review] Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine,6,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/f120m/review_coanphillipi_deadlift_routine/,"##What is the Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine?##

Summary from [Tsampa.org](http://tsampa.org/training/scripts/coan_phillipi_deadlift/):

&gt; This is a 10-week deadlift program designed by the legendary powerlifter Ed Coan for Mark Phillipi. It goes against the grain of the ""To Deadlift More, Don't Deadlift"" school of thought, but Phillipi claims it took his dead from 505lbs to 540lbs with power to spare (no mention of whether drug-free or not) ... The program consists of one workout a week where heavy and speed deadlifts are followed by various low-back intensive assistance exercises. The first 4 weeks focus on conditioning the back by using short rest periods and high volume, with the last 6 weeks ramping up towards a new max attempt. The program also champions power shrugs to improve the lockout.

##Who is the Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine For?##

This is a very intense program if followed strictly, though arguably less intense than the [Smolov squat routine](http://www.joeskopec.com/smolov.html).  This program works well for those that have stalled with deadlift progress, coming back from an injury, looking to improve technique, or push themselves quite hard to make considerable progress in 10 weeks.

##How Would I Follow This Routine?##

[Powerpage.net](http://www.powerpage.net/coanphildead.html) gives an overview of the program, and [Tsampa.org](http://tsampa.org/training/scripts/coan_phillipi_deadlift/) includes a calculator to get your target weights and sets over the next 10 weeks.

---
##My Experience With Coan/Phillipi (Fall 2009)##
    
**Prior Stats**

* *Deadlift Max* 405 lbs
* *Weight* 123.5 lbs

###Ending Stats###

* *Deadlift Max* 430 lbs (+25 lbs)
* *Weight* 125 lbs (+1.5 lbs)

###Summary of Experience###

Core deadlift sets ramp up before dropping, and then ramping up again.  During those first four weeks, the volume and circuits really take a toll on you, both mentally and physically.  I would say week 4 was the worst.  From there, the week 5 and 6 were a much needed ""break"".  My progress held well and what I felt was difficult on week 4 for my main deadlift set was quite easy on week 7, and on week 8, I lifted more than my previous 1RM, which boosted my mood.

The speed sets, especially in the beginning will be brutal, especially to those that are not used to that type of volume - 8 sets of 3 reps at 60% of your 1RM with only 90 seconds between sets.  As the program progresses, it ramps down to 6x3 and 3x3, but not before kicking you in the ass.  I've heard people vomiting on this program, and while it didn't happen to me, I came very close a couple times.

Aside from following the program as close as possible, if anyone is looking to try this, I would highly recommend locking in your nutrition, prehab, rehab, and sleep schedule before starting.  You may be doing more work than usual, so if you're looking to maintain your current weight, you'll probably want to add a couple hundred extra calories to your deadlift day.

For prehab and rehab, I foam rolled when possible, which I felt cut down on some (not all) of the DOMS.  I also got as much sleep as possible (around 10hrs every night) thanks to a slightly easier course load that semester.
 
###Mistakes I Made###
 
I tried to follow this program to the best of my ability, but there were times I failed at doing so.  In the beginning, my nutrition was not as solid as it could have been and I paid the price in the later weeks (8-10) when I was really struggling with the weights.  I had lowered my fat intake too much, probably less than 30g/day, and felt very sluggish.  I did not use any pre-workout supplements, but I think that could have helped (some caffeine, yohimbine hcl, or 1,3).  Also, this is a very back intensive program, especially on the lats.  I made the mistake of not doing more lat-specific work prior to starting this program, and I felt that hindered my progress a bit.  I think had I corrected my mistakes (hindsight is a bitch), I could have added an extra 5-10lbs over the course of the program.

###Overall Impressions###
 
I felt this program worked for me, as I was able to add a good 25 lbs to my deadlift in 10 weeks (roughly 10 lbs / month).  I know some people on my old powerlifting squad used it during summer 2010 and all had generally good results.  I don't know the exact numbers, but I know everyone walked away with a higher deadlift max.

Why do some people have insanely high ""pound for pound"" strength, while other people who by all measures appear MUCH bigger, have huge muscles, seem to have less functional strength than the person who appears much smaller?

To make this explicit, I am not attempting to keep my weight constant -- it's ok if I gain weight.  I am also not attempting to maintain my current physical appearance -- it's ok if I look bigger and my muscles gain size.   What I *am* attempting is to make every pound gained be as *efficient* as possible.  

So this brings me to my question.  Is one pound of muscle always equivalent to one pound of muscle?   What other factors come into play and how can I influence this?  Any supplements I should take?  Or Avoid?  Other general advice?

I'm a collegiate strength coach and I've competed in a few powerlifting meets. I'm well educated and well certified, but I've had issues with my serratus posterior inferior for a few years now and I think its related to my breathing more than anything else. So basically I'm looking for some perspective on an issue that is a bit out of my realm, and might be interesting for a few of you other smart jocks.

The SPIs primary action is depression of the lower ribs, so its active in expiration, however its also active in extension, and thoracic rotation. I notice that its stiff as hell when I wake up in the morning.. when I've been nearly immobile for 6-8 hours and probably breathing pretty shallow.. and it also becomes stiff as hell towards the end of the day when my posture tends to fall apart. Its only an uncomfortable nuisance, but its there all day and it takes me a good 15 minutes of specific mobility work to soften everything back up and get my thoracic mobility back up to adequate.

Anyone have any interesting ideas? I'm also looking for a good book to read with some breathing exercises and programming ideas. I'd just like some exposure to the stuff. I've gone hunting myself and turned up with nothing.. search the books on googles play market yourselves you'll likely come up with the same 10,000 books on yoga and stress reduction and zen buddhism.

I recently suffered an injury that forces minimization of use of my right arm. I'm a triathlete, and cyclist primary, but not professional, and train to make myself as athletic and dynamic as possible. 

Because of the extent of my injury, I recalled reading a few articles on the effects of unilateral training on the rate of recover and return to normal use on the injured side and it piqued my interest. Could I enhance my recovery by training the uninjured side? So I did a bit of research and found a few articles. 

[Article 1](http://jap.physiology.org/content/101/5/1514.full)

[Article 2](http://www.jappl.org/content/106/3/830.full)

[Article 3](http://jap.physiology.org/content/96/5/1861.full)

It appears that the studies conclude that its likely that there are some benefits of Unilateral training during injury. My recovery period is likely to be 12 weeks, and while I'm not immobilized now, I will be anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks. I spoke with my doctor about this and he was only vaguely aware of this effect. My wife, an OTR, is also aware of but has no experience with this.

My question: Has anyone here had any experience with what I'm talking about, and if so, did it prove effective? It seems as though continuing to train the non-injured (my dominant side, already) is good as aesthetics isn't really a goal of mine and there's no reason for atrophy to happen bilaterally just because one side is injured, but it seems as though there may be even more benefits to be had. What do you all think?

I have for a couple of years now had trouble with my elbows. In every pressing movement, given a certain load, I will had a pop/snap in my elbows in the negative portion of the movement (at around 90 degree flexion).

The snap/pop feels more powerful in the right elbow than the left. This has at times resulted in slight dull pain after the session or the day after. This happens after I go heavy in the pressing movements, especially if I work in dips or similar.

I have stopped doing all tricep-isolation exercises entirely. I only do ohp, bench and dips at times, no other pressing movements.

At first I was thinking it was nervus ulnaris playing a trick on me -- but that does not seem to be the case. I can not feel or see the nerve moving, plus, I don't have any tingeling in my fingers or similar either.

That leaves the medial triceps head. My idea here is that either the head or the bursa between the head and the surrounding tissue/bone has gotten inflamed, possibly chronic inflammation since I've had it for several years now. Because of this inflammation, its getting cramped in there or something, and thus the snapping is happening because the tendon (or whatever it is) is popping out of where it should be.

What I do know for sure is that the snapping is in the area of the medial triceps head and nervus ulnaris. It's in that region.

To my question: what can I do to fix this? If my diagnosis is correct, surgery sounds dramatic but is an option. Otherwise perhaps cortisone? Or should I try something lighter first?

Also, does my reasoning sound reasonable or do you think it could be something else? I have tried speaking with several physical therapists and similar, but gotten no where. They all either don't know or just tell me not to do the movements that cause the snapping (ie, all pressing movements).

I have not had this problem my entire life, it started a few years back when I was still doing tricep-specific exercises. Most likely went too heavy too quickly and messed something up that's now haunting me.

Thanks in advance.

I lifted a lot in high school and post-college, but the last two years have been dominated by Ironman training (which ended three weeks ago). A friend commented that I have ""triathlete arms"" now; I didn't realize how much muscle mass I had lost in my upper body while training.

My usual lifting regimen is bench, lat pull-down, military press (with dumbells), bicep curls (with dumbells), tricep press(?), every other day. It's very basic and rudimentary, and I know it needs to be adjusted and modernized (my dad taught me this regimen when I was 12 and I never changed it).

I'd like to focus on power lifting at first to get my bench 1RM to 315, then switch to body building mode.

1. What is the optimal number of reps and sets to get muscle mass? I'm used to 4 sets with 10 reps per set (1:30 rest between sets), but after reading some past posts here, I think 6 sets is preferable with 4-6 reps per set.

2. How do I get bigger arms? My bench max pre-Ironman was 295lbs, and though I was barrel chested, my arms looked like they were proportionately small.

3. How much rest between sets is optimal for both power lifting and body building regiments? I've heard as low as 1:00 and as high as 2:30, but even then I'll see people in the gym with seemingly 5min rest between sets.

I'd like to keep my gym time at or below an hour, and my old regiment would take me 35-40 minutes.

For non-BW lifts, the weight is increased and the reps decreased each week, and for BW exercises the progression is taken from ""Funtional Training for Sports"" (Boyle 2004). Week four is evaluation.

* Dumbbell Row -- w1 10-12 reps, w2 8-10, w3 6-8, w4 10-12


**Day 2 (Thursday):**

* Cook hip lifts -- 8 reps per leg all weeks


*Tri-Set 2*

* Parallel Grip pull-ups -- AMRAP for all weeks
* Push-press -- w1 10-12, w2 8-10, w3 6-8, w4 10-12

It's been about a month since I stopped doing intermittent fasting to test whether or not it would alleviate my symptoms.  TL;DR: it hasn't ~~and I no longer believe that I'm going hypotensive.~~

Since moving back to a more frequent diet plan I've still been occasionally getting lightheaded doing power cleans.  The only time I ever passed out was during a fasted set of them but I don't think it was the fasting that caused the issue.  I think it was the increased caffeine consumption that accompanied the fasting.  I've noticed a correlation between severity of symptoms and pre-training caffeine intake regardless of meal timing.

~~Due to caffeine's effects as a vasoconstrictor, hypotension seems unlikely; my new self-diagnosis is exercise induced hypertension.~~
It has been explained to me in the comments that caffeine is likely to be exacerbating the hypotension.

In any case, I'm not terribly concerned.  I will be toning back the stimulant use ~~and trying some kind of preworkout vasodilator supplement (suggestions appreciated)~~.

I am 5'11, 26 and a 180 lbs. I started lifting exactly a year ago as a way to gain weigth coming from a rather difficult surgery. 

A friend and I got into a fight to defend a third friend. We were heavily outnumbered. Thank god we knew how to defend ourselves...I ended up with a bad case of broken face and long story short lost my sight for more or less three months. ([Here is a picture of me](http://imgur.com/dOcfHJI) just for the lulz...ahhh good times!...we actually had alot of fun with staff at the hospital)

As soon as my sight came back and the doctors allowed me to train I came back to boxing and started lifting. Back then, a year ago exactly I was 139 pounds (from 155 before surgery) and was so weak that I could barely take the stairs.

So I have been lifting and especially eating for a year. I realise now that my routine is not the greatest and I would like to switch to starting strength (the programming strength version with pull/chin ups).

Here is the issue, I am currently on a cut. I eat around 1500-1800 cals a day with 200 grams of proteins. Should I carry on my cut with my program or start starting strength ,or any similar strength program, right away ignoring the cut?

I am right now around 15% to 16% bf. I would very much like to carry on the cut to around 12%. I plan to get back seriously into boxing(Muay Thai) now that I can the excess bodyfat is really uncomfortable. I checked for similar threads on the starting strength and their answer was keep eating even if you are above 20%. This is not really an option for me.

My program,

*Monday* 
Chest: 
Bench press,Incline dumbell press, Flyes,dips, 
Biceps:
Barbell curls, spreacher curls,

*Tuesday* 
Back of the legs 
Stiff legged deadlift, Leg curls
abs:
leg raises,weighted crunches,tuck ins,planks

*Wednesday*
Shoulders:
Dumbell press, barbell front raises, Lateral raises,Bent over laterals,

*Thursday:*
Front of the Legs:
Squat,Deadlift,Leg raises.
Abs:
As in tuesday

*Friday:*
Back:
Chin ups, Inverted rows, T-bar, back extension
Triceps:
Skull crushers, overhead triceps extensions,cable extension.

Now that I am on a cut: 30mn cardio 7 days a week at an average of 12 km/h.

Here are my stats:

Squat 225,Bench 188, Deadlift 225,OHP 125.

My intermediate term goals is to get my squat  to 1.5X bw. Bench to 225 and my deadlift to 300+. My long term goal is to put on some more muscle mass (around 20lbs) but in a more controlled fashion. I would also very much like to learn olympic lift so I could translate that speed and explosiveness in boxing.

Did not plan for such a long post!

Thank you guys!

As a gymnast/cross-fitter, I can see a lot of these being useful for building great core strength (like the mountain climbers, dragon walks, various muscleups), and some are staple (hello burpees!), but some of them are less exercise and more just show-offy (one-arm pushup claps, backflip burpees? come on now you're just showing off...).  
   
  
I like all the single limb isolations (single-leg box jump, spiderman pushups, pistols), but can anyone explain the value of diamond pushups as opposed to normal pushups, more tricep isolation?

The more kaleidoscopic the perspective, the better; thanks Bruce Lee.

I exercise very rigorously: running to and fro class 3 miles per day with Vibram Five Fingers, practicing martial arts 7x per week (about 2 hours each day) and lifting (normally a CrossFit WOD) 3-4x per week. I haven't started swimming 500 meters  7x per week yet as a part of my regimen, but let's pretend I have hypothetically.

I'm not a vegetarian, but rather a pescatarian (or is it pescetarian? I always see both and have never been able to figure it out), meaning I make exceptions for fish. I eat fish, namely tuna or salmon in the form of organic canned fish, about once or twice a week. I also take NutraOrigin brand fish oil supplements 4x per day (morning, afternoon, with dinner, before bed). That's a total of 4,000mg fish oil and 2,400mg of omega-3's.

Nuts (cashews, walnuts), omega-3 organic eggs now and then, raw chia seeds, flax, hemp, and occasionally frozen acai puree are all staples of my ""diet"" (I hate that word). I eat about 2-3 servings of nuts per day (also almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, peanuts). The raw chia seeds, flax, hemp, and acai are either eaten by the tablespoonful, or added to plant-based protein smoothies every other day, so I'm getting plenty of omegas there as well, I'm well aware.

Given my ""diet"" and highly active regimen, how do you feel about me taking fish oil 4x per day? 

I also intermittently fast on a small scale (""[Warrior Diet](http://www.warriordiet.com/content/view/24/35/)""-esque), so I don't eat breakfast and nothing up until around noon, which is when I eat half a day's worth of fruit and vegetables, and a few hours later I'll eat some more fruit and some nuts, or a protein shake, depending if I worked out earlier in the day or not. I'll then eat a huge salad along with the rest of the vegetables for the day at about 6pm, and an hour later, I'll have my main meal. My calorie counts for the day vary anywhere from scat to the brink of 2,000, averaging at about 1,500.

Would you recommend I completely drop the fish oil supplements and eat actual fish one or two more times per week (3-4 times)?

If not, which ""organic"" fish oil supplements do you find the most trust-worthy? I've read that the coasts off of New Zealand offer some of the cleanest and lesser polluted waters, and thus the best fish oil comes from there(?)

Eat lots of vegetable and fruit, choose lean proteins, eggs (mostly whites), good fats like nuts, and limit carbohydrates to vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains like whole wheat bread and brown rice. Nothing battered and fried. Daily, try to restrict about 500 calories below your maintenance.  Try to exercise some. Otherwise, you're cheating, which will happen, and is part of the experiment.  

**Group B will take advice B: Strictly monitor grain-based carbs and dairy.  Limit fruit.**

Please PM if you’d like to be in the Group A or B.  I will take your stats now and track them in a spreadsheet for four weeks.  At the end of 4 weeks, I’ll request a survey:

-On a scale of 1 to 10, how difficult was it to implement this diet?

i'm looking for a good answer as to why slamming is bad. i've always thought that every slam is basically just a bit of a rest, and that's not what you're supposed to do during an exercise in my mind (it's like those people doing alternating bicep curls). now, when things get really heavy, i totally understand the incentive to slam. but doesn't this just mean that one should drop weight (what an annoying pun) in order to maintain proper slam-less form?

Keen to enhance my proprioceptive abilities and increase my inter and intra muscular coordination I have been looking into different forms of exercise. I have found that traditional conditioning wasn't making me better at my sport, infact I believe things like dead-lifts and squats decreased my performance. tightening me up making me stiff, slow and unresponsive.

I just got my new gear in the mail from the states http://i.imgur.com/j9I8c.jpg , the gear to note is the ballistic balls, instability disc's and slant boards, heavy rope and ankle weights along with some hurdles. You may also notice the weird fin things, they are for AquaKinetic Training. 

Here is a bit about the head trainer at sports science lab http://www.sportsciencelab.com/articles/gavins-story

I will be really interested to see what you guys think of this as its a very different approach from what is normally done.

1311735038.0,0,self.AdvancedFitness,j0s1c,Help me figure out my back pain - details inside,1,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/j0s1c/help_me_figure_out_my_back_pain_details_inside/,"Used to powerlift, cut back when I started training to fight.  I started to get back pain that I ignored for a while, eventually it got bad enough I went to a doctor.  Spoke with him, he checked for the obvious scoliosis. hernia, he asked me if I ever had blood in my pee, or trouble peeing, no, I didn't.  

He took xrays, said my spine was in perfect alignment, and he didn't see anything indicative of disc issues (do those even show up on xrays), but due to my symptom of pain when hyperextending, especially on one leg, he decided it was a stress fracture, explaining that small stress fractures won't show on xrays.  He told me I'd be fine in 2 - 3 weeks, just rest, don't do anything that stresses it.  

I have had pulled muscles before, and bulged a disc once, and this feels like neither.


7 months later, after a LOT of resting, my back is definitely better, but still has some issues.  I have slowly started to run, and do very high rep back raises, stuff like that.  Just curious if anyone has had this.

Symptoms
------------------


*All pain shows up on the right side at the very base of my spine*

- Pain with increased intra abdominal pressure.  I started to get worried when it hurt if I laughed too hard, or tried to make my pee stream into a sand blaster (I do this on a regular basis).  This has subsided, at least to the point I don't notice it when slashing flies with my yellow light saber.

- At first I had unbelievable pain when hanging from a bar and consciously relaxing my abs / back muscles.  This pain is so reliable that I have started using it to gauge my recovery. 

- If I were to do a barbell back squat, the pain gets worse with a) heavier weights, and b) pushing my ass back.  As soon as my hips break, I feel it.  Even if I stick my butt out just standing up and no bar or anything, it is painful, if I keep lower back in 1 spot.

- Pain when I having my legs behind me and pulling my hips back.  Think using your feet to scoot a motorcycle back, but not pushing with your feet in front, but pulling the motorcycle back with your feet starting behind you.  This is likely just making it slightly ""hyper extend""

**TLDR**Now that I read this, it sounds like its pretty much hyperextensions, hanging, and intra abdominal pressure, but the pressure doesn't bother it anymore.

I took the couple weeks off, started to go hard minus squats, deads, and running, kept training hard for a couple months, realized I was retarded, took 6 weeks off, tried to start again, pain came back when I hyper extended during an overhead press like a retard.  Took 2 months off and now I have been slowly returning to some stuff.  I am thinking of taking another month or 2 of just versa climber, upper body lifts, and things that I find ""safe"" like ""hyper extensions"" (making sure I don't actually hyper extend) with bodyweight and 5 second holds, stuff like that.

It's killing me to not train.  I went from 187 at 13 % (I'm only 5'6"" so cut me some slack) to 182 at 18 % bodyfat.  My legs got hella tiny too, I felt like I had cancer for a while.  Not to diminish the seriousness of cancer, but... It fucking sucked.

I don't know if I buy the stress fracture, unless its a facet joint?  I don't know and I get this vibe from my PCP that he doesn't take it seriously.

And I know already that none of what you say is medical advice, I don't sue you or anything, just want to have an idea so I can come up with a plan to return to beastmode.

That seems to be the consensus among many fitness circles.

I recently heard, however, that stretching after lifting will really only depump your pumped muscles, the sensation you feel primarily being the blood moving rather than useful stretching of muscle connection areas.

Anyone have anything to say about this?

I think this was a valid useful question with some downvotes from people who ~~just assumed I was a total noob from using the word ""pumped."" I never indicated that I believe that maximum pump is a training goal.~~ got linked from that other thread. you know, that guy's awesome google link was basically reiterating the first two sentences of this post.

well, I found [this blog post/article](http://www.hotbodytraining.com/the-low-down-on-static-stretching/)... (before i found out about that other thread btw)
&gt;Following on from this, many experts started recommending static stretching after a workout to negate this strength decrease. To throw another spanner in the works, top soft tissue experts are now recommending that static stretching should be done cold, without warming up. The idea behind this is that when warm, the muscles simply elongate and then return to their normal state, whereas stretching a cold muscle will force it to undergo structural changes and increase in length.

obviously this one source isn't enough, but are you guys still really sure that post-workout is a good time to static stretch?",,False,self,t5_2s9km,True,,,True,t3_id1uk,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/id1uk/seriously_whats_the_best_time_to_stretch/,

Very simply put you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Exercise helps with this, but by far the most significant thing you can do is to fix your diet: eat less and eat better. ""

I think this is just garbage advice for anyone.  The whole fewer calories than you burn simply isn't helpful information for someone trying to lose weight.  The most important things people need to know are (1) that diet is more important than exercise and (2) that your diet needs to include lots of vegetables, protein, good fats, and include no [edit: grain-based] carbs (even brown ones) or dairy.  Anyone who understands these can lop off weight at will.  

The calorie in/out thing, as true as it may be in a lab, has simply failed people for decades as a piece of advice.
