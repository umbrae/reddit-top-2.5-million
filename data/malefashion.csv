Jun Takahashi is a shy guy who makes clothes under the Undercoverism label. The label started in 1989 when Jun (nickname Jonio for his affinity for and similarities to Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten) was attending Bunka Fashion College. He was initially just making clothes for his friends and would only sell to people who had some kind of approval: a positive introduction, a close friend, whatever. In 1993 he and Nigo of Bathing Ape fame opened a store in Harajuku called Nowhere with one half of the store being dedicated to UC and the other half being Bape. Shit exploded, they made money and a new store was opened in Aoyama. The west really started to take note of the brand in 2003, after the Scab show. This is when the first interviews with Jun from western publications start.

In my opinion, the Undercover design philosophy is very easy to trace. For one his fw11 women's show Mirror, when pressed what his clothes meant, he said ""they're clothes for women."" Simple. The initial efforts are all very punk driven in the vein of the Sex Pistols and similarly '77 styled crust punks. As time goes on, the punk elements of frayed edges, deconstruction and anarchy hold true until the late 2000s. With the Dieter Rams-inspired ""Less But Better"" collection in ss2010, Jun states that he's taking the ""Less But Better"" concept of minimalism in clothing with him into the future and it shows. Some argue that the previous incarnation of clothes were cooler, but I feel that it just changes the volume of the statement.

Jun has an interesting relationship with the runway. He'll leave, he'll return. It is my understanding that he's more interested in developing alternative ways of exposing product, one in which he has more control over the process. You'll find lookbooks with very specific shots instead of runway shows to get the clothes out, as with the underman season. This is coupled by a wish to not move at the pace of the seasons (though he does) as well as his desire to stay out of the public light

Undercover clothes have a lot of recurring motifs. References to music, like Psycho Color's nirvana t-shirt, the signature grid pattern, the raw hems, darts in interesting places, cropped pants, prints where prints wouldn't normally be, [vent holes](http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lij9ueR9ti1qe5o8zo1_500.jpg), technical fabrics, mixing fabrics, mixing constructions of two different garments, obscuring of faces in shows, a weird [fixation on western style typography](http://www.selectism.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/undercoverism-rebel-tshirt-2.jpg) and so on. Thematically speaking, the brand trades in phrases like ""for rebels,"" ""we make noise not clothes,"" ""fuck the past, fuck the future,"" and the fluid identity of undercover, undercoverism, urcrism, u et al.

Jun also runs the brand AFFA (anarchy forever forever anarchy), started in 1994. It has some of the characteristics of undercover design philosophy, sharing patterns, but is generally more toned down and more street. Good luck finding it not in japan.The Undercover x Uniqlo collaboration in 2011-2012 was a bit of a shock because it had been only a few years since Jun had stated that he disapproved of brands going over to fast fashion, as it was a money grab. His reversal of opinion is noted in one of the interviews below. The Gyakusou line started when Nike approached him after his GIRA (Gyakusou [which means running backwards, as they run against traffic] International Running Association) and asked him to design some things for him. He disliked many of the things available and noted that color is very important, as is harmony. He promotes Nike as having the best fabrics in the world, which works nicely with his technical aesthetic.

Authenticity in the case of menswear is closely tied to ideas of masculinity (in a very narrow, Ron Swanson-y kind of way). You post some pics about denim workwear and suddenly all these garage woodshop guys appear and bemoan the decline in blue collar skills while berating a generation of man-boys obsessed with well-marketed period clothing.

I call bullshit. The challenge the idea that authenticity is even really a 'thing' and, if it does exist, that it existed more strongly in people's minds than ever in the field. However, I wanted to bring this up for discussion. Authenticity is to men as being cute is to women: a vague notion that we measure against but will probably always fail to attain.


Some discussion points:

1) Is 'authenticity' real? If so, what makes a brand 'authentic'?

2) What brands are 'authentic'?

3) Why is menswear (or men in general) obsessed with the idea of authenticity?

4) Does it matter from a fashion perspective if something is authentic? 

5) How does the idea of ""value"" (as in, these jeans are a good value) relate to ideas of authenticity?

Anyway I'm a huge nerd and I'm interested in the design choices of the brands we know and love especially regarding the labels, the tags and other miscellaneous packaging, and the use of branding in the clothes themselves.

I keep the tags of all the clothes I buy in a box in my wardrobe. I started doing this just mainly just in case I came to sell anything on, but I find it interesting comparing the different ways brands have approached the task of designing a tag. A large proportion go for the ""white card, black embossed font"" route, which I suppose is meant to communicate luxury etc. but I find that quite boring. Interesting and unconventional use of materials that can communicate the brand's ethos to the consumer is the ultimate goal here, I think. Junya's blue acetate is probably the most interesting one that I can think of off the top of my head.

Similarly the actual labels inside the clothes is wasted potential for many brands. Some I particularly like: Rick Owens' parallel labels; ditto Robert Geller; Margiela's original white labels; White Mountaineering's white-on-white embroidery; Facetasm's test card. I like it when additional information is included, for example the season or the name of the piece.

Finally branding. A topic that probably deserves its own thread. Rejection of branding seems to be a natural part of first getting into clothes, but in reality everyone is susceptible, whether consciously on unconsciously, be it something as blatant as Thom Browne's tricolour, as subtle as Margiela's pick stitches or something that was initially part of the design, but has come to represent the brand as a whole such as the central back seam on Rick's t-shirts. Examples of branding I like: White Mountaineering's hang hook detail; WTAPS; Common Projects' golden numbers; the mighty swoosh etc. There's loads more I'm sure but I'm running out of steam.

When I started writing I had other stuff to say and more examples but I've forgotten. It'll come back to me. Hopefully there's enough here to start a bit of discussion",,False,self,t5_2seq5,False,,,True,t3_17pij8,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/17pij8/labels_tags_branding/,

what is everyone's go to?

i love (old) uniqlo ocbds because they do the job, and more importantly they fit me perfectly.  my large uniqlo ocbds fit perfectly over jeans or whatever, and when i want them unbuttoned XL does the trick.

out of all my 'nice' oxfords-- basically everything above the 100$ price point-- have to say supreme is my favorite.  they fit right in between uniqlo L and XL, so it's very 80/90's dadcore relaxed but still quite flattering (all button downs are flattering).  supreme's materials are also quite nice for the price point-- more interesting than a lot of 300+ shirts (tb, sophnet)

my thom browne shirts are elegantly designed, in particular i love how the stitching is either tonal or hidden down the placket and cuffs.  very chunky material.  however in the last year it seems his shirting has gotten a lot slimmer, so a TB3 is unflattering in my gut but a TB4 is so long it hangs out down with my knees.

i have two gitman shirts, they are both truly rich in color and they seem to be made to expire really quickly.  my green overdye is fraying everywhere.  definitely the nicest shirts i have in terms of color.  a little overpriced in my opinion, and could be longer

Another example would be Armani. What made him famous? On the Doma thread in SZ, they mention that some journalist compared DD to Armani and then disparaged the writer as disrespecting Armani. For someone who's so synonymous with suiting and, in my mind, a conservative look, to have SZ defend him is surprising. 

You could probably list a dozen names like this. Might also be worthwhile to talk about the old heads of houses like Balenciaga and Dior even though that's more historic and they're obviously dead so, yolo I guess.

Our primary objective here is to inspire, and to create a space where the particulars of style and fashion can be laid out. As such, starting this week, we're rolling out the following weekly threads.

Monday: **What I'm Wearing Today (WIWT)** -- This is self-explanatory.

Tuesday: **What He Wore Today (WHeWT)** -- here we want you to post a look or item you saw someone else wear. It can be from a lookbook, from a blog, from a pic you snapped on the street, hell just from an ad on the side of a bus. Something you saw on someone else and liked and want to discuss further.

Wednesday: **Shopping List** -- post what's on your shopping list. It can be an extravagant item you're saving up to buy once you become a billionaire, or just simple but cool pieces you're hoping to acquire soon. This thread includes recent purchases as well.

Thurs: **Item of the Week** -- each week we'll focus on a particular mens item (oxfords, dress watches, raw denim) and create a thread just for that.

Please be patient as we sort through and experiment with these over the next few weeks. We may roll out more, or cull a few, or combine these threads, depending on what **you guys**, the subscriber, want. Again, /MF should be a place to get your stylistic juices flushing around, to really nerd the fuck out on menswear. Looking forward to this.

Fuck the Haters,
The /MF Mods.

A lot of the posts in /r/MF, especially in the WYWT threads, to me, are so unfashionable I find myself completely perplexed. I have an inkling it's because I'm British. I understand different tastes/styles, but I see some awfully put together outfits with people commenting positively, and I'm just sat here thinking ""this is awful"".

High fashion brands are dropped in, but to me it seems as if nine times out of ten, people have picked the worst possible items from these high fashion brands. Can someone explain to me what I'm missing? I there some underground thing I'm not aware of?

I don't want to name names, or point out who I think is dressing badly, but some examples are white sports socks with tatty trainers, ill fitting jeans, hiking brands etc. 

I don't frequent any fashion forums, I usually just keep up with some blogs that I use for inspiration, but I've never seen anything on those like some of the outfits posted here over the last month or so. It leaves me at a loss.

In today's WYWT, I saw one outfit that looked acceptable, but it was super casual and what I would throw on to go to the shop.

I'm really trying to not sounds haughty and elitest, but I seriously think I am missing something, some knowledge, some 'style' that I'm completely unaware of.

This doesn't mean there isn't anything to look forward to, however, and I'm hoping that what we see over the next few days will create some interesting discussion here, or at the very least introduce us to some new designers. 

There is also less of an emphasis on runway presentations in London, with many designers opting for a so-called ""Static Presentation"".

Now, due to the private nature of some of these showings, it won't be possible to get pictures for all of the shows, but I'll try and update fairly regularly with links to the collections. I'm going to be really busy today (which is ok because Monday probably has the worst line-up), but with any luck I should find some time in the evening.

The easiest way to watch the shows is either through [Now Fashion](http://nowfashion.com), who will be posting photos ""live"" from select shows (note fashion shows *always* start late); [style.com](http://www.style.com/fashionshows/menswear), who are slower to update and don't feature as many designers; and [London Collections](http://www.londoncollections.co.uk/men) themselves, who should feature highlights on their highlights page, funnily enough. 

Hopefully through these three sources and some googling we'll be able to see pics for just about everything.

Since MF is pretty slow this thread should easily suffice for all three days, and if this is a success I'll make something similar for Milan and Paris.
____
Please note: 

* This is intended to be a novice-friendly environment, so please ask questions.

* Close-minded people do not make for good discussion and are not welcome. I certainly don't expect anyone to like or even 'get' every designer, but outright rejection is not helpful, nor does it elucidate. Try to think about *why* you like or dislike something.

* I hope that this thread can operate fairly autonomously, without me having to spark discussion or be constantly posting links etc. If everyone puts a bit of effort into the conversation here I think we'll all find it rewarding and it'd be appreciated.

I don't have any personal experience with ToJ/JC stuff, but I know a lot of people in these weird internet fashion communities we're part of do. They're no doubt a prolific brand, and have sort of set the standard for quality MTM leather jackets.
I'd love to hear what users with more experience have to say, and their thoughts on the brand's future.

now, i'm in nice for 5 days. on the last day or the second to last day i'm here, i'll go to the store and pick up everything that i find that you guys requsted. sale stuff will be depleted in some sizes ofc, common sense, so expect that. but tell me what you want *sale or not* and i'll *try* to pick it up in your size. 

so:

1. look on cosstore webshop and find something you like, and decide you want it.

2. make a comment on this thread stating what you'd like, in what color, and in what size. i reccomend being vague/flexible ('any color' or 'either M or L') to help your chances of getting something.

3. send a 50% deposit of 1.04 * 1.08 * (price of cos piece online) to adhi5000@gmail.com using the 'payment for goods' option. include your username and your item in the memo of the payment, so i can match it to this thread. the .04 is the paypal fee and the .08 is my fee. *i will refund that deposit if i don't find the item, you have my word.* the point of the deposit is so i don't get screwed on some items like my good friend /u/hirokinakamura when he did his outlier proxy. **remember that this is in euros, so convert to usd and send that much*

4. i will visit the store and buy as much as i can that was requested, and upon my arrival to america, ship 'em out to my fellow redditors. 

let me know if there you have any questions and/or concerns. otherwise, get looking! i highly recommend this f/w seasons jackets, and any seasons sweaters. as for sizing, i'd say take your normal size in everything, and if between size up.",,False,self,t5_2seq5,1373198164.0,,,True,t3_1hsre9,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/1hsre9/onetimeonly_cos_proxy_service_2_usa/,

an example that comes to mind: trashpile. the very first fit I saw of him was one where he was wearing a fuzzy Thom Browne cardigan. TB implies a clinically precise menswear aesthetic... he was wearing it with something like baggy jeans or sandals or other trashpile-ish attire. To me it looked entirely out of place, like some rando just bought some hype $$$ item for the name factor and tossed it on whatever he was wearing, but after seeing a few more of his fits it clicked in a way for me.

another example for me: huhwot. I remember skimming through his fits at first because they struck me as all the same -- button shirt over long tee over shorts or jeans and occasionally some interesting shoes. As I rarely read WAYWT any more and skim through quite quickly, I wrote them off as pretty boring and mediocre, but as I've seen his submissions more and more his purchases stand out to me as perfectly coherent with his style, ranging from gothninja brands to bape to H&amp;M to whatever. He takes his buys and makes them 100% him.

Academic fashion as it were. I figured some people may find it interesting. It's a bit dry though. disregard if there are spelling errors. 

some pictures of the coat [one](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpkkhlGYmD1qh78jlo1_500.jpg), [two](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FTC0X0H-mTQ/UKFJ95TyEkI/AAAAAAAAOS4/1ySe66yUeLI/s1600/bill+cunningham_MMM+duve+coat.jpg), [three](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9dxj0RaQz1qbpdcto1_1280.jpg)

Question: In what way is this garment characteristic of Martin Margiela’s design philosophy?


  This question is not appropriate for a number of reasons. First of all, Maison Martin Margiela focusses on collaboration and working as a team. Martin himself does not allow in person interviews, and refers to the house collectively in correspondence. Additionally, the term ‘design philosophy’ is far too broad of a descriptor to be able to work with constructively.  It is more appropriate and useful to inquire as to whether the Duvet coat contains themes that are consistent throughout Maison Martin Margiela’s collections.
	

  Three main themes that are present in many of the house’s collections can also be found in the Duvet coat. The first concept is the questioning of the experience of creating and wearing a garment (which is frequently termed deconstruction). The second is the idea of reproduction. The third theme is the concept behind Margiela’s ‘Artisanal’ line (Line 0) which combines the two previous themes and also introduces the factors time and re-appropriation. 
	

   The Duvet coat was part of the Autumn/Winter 1999-2000 collection. The coat was manufactured by Featherlight, an Italian maker of bed sheets and comforters. It is constructed out of cotton and filled with down feathers, like a duvet. It bears the plain white cotton  label of Line 1(Womenswear, pre 2008). The Duvet coat is square with detachable sleeves and designed to lie flat. The shoulders are not defined and the sleeves applied to the surface of the duvet. It can be worn as a coat, a waistcoat, and a wrap. A series of duvet covers made out of various materials such as wool (which can be worn separately as a coat), denim, and clear PVC for the rain can be worn over the duvet for protection. Vintage bed sheets were also remade into covers. They can also be worn alone as dresses. Margiela did not hold a runway show for this collection (something they have done frequently) and instead invited buyers to a showroom to watch a film, directed by Martin Margiela, which depicts models wearing the clothes and accessories of the collection. As a result, not many photos of this collection are available. 
	
Margiela is often described as a deconstructionist, or a creator of anti-fashion. However, as Alison Gil points out, deconstruction does not mean destruction (nor is it possible to define clearly). She argues that Margiela brings to light the ‘bi-directionality’ of the labor of creating and wearing clothes. When making a garment, the material is both formed and deformed, create and destroyed. Likewise, in wearing an item of clothing, the body is formed and deformed.  By exposing these conflicts through exposed seams, and unconventional materials, Margiela forces us to reevaluate our understanding of fashion.  Traces of this sentiment can be found in the Duvet coat. First of all, the material is somewhat unconventional for a coat. Down coats exist, but they usually have a nylon or polyester exterior to protect them from the elements. By translating a down blanket directly into a coat, the question of what constitutes appropriate material for clothing is posed to the wearer and viewer of the garment. In addition, there is a deconstructionist element in the cut of the coat. As it is designed to lay flat, it eschews the convention of creating a garment that follows the shape of the body. There are no defined shoulders on the coat; rather, the body of the person wearing it both forms and is (de)formed by its construction, or lack thereof. Margiela pursued a similar theme in their Autumn/Winter 1998-1999 collection, showing a number of ‘flat’ garments that had displaced shoulders and neck openings.
	
Another theme that is present throughout the work of Maison Martin Margiela is the idea of reproduction. Every season they produce a collection within the men’s and women’s lines of garments consisting of very close replicas of a found item of clothing. The label will state where and when the original garment if from. Margiela is also interested in reproducing items from their own archive. For the Autumn/Winter 1993 collection, Margiela reproduced a selection of popular garments from the past five years, dying them grey and marking the original collection year. This fascination with replication is also apparent in the Duvet coat. Rather than manufacture it in one of their normal factories, Margiela chose to commission an actual bed linens company to create the coat. Although it is still a coat, attention has been paid to making seem as close to a duvet as possible. The flatness and the ability to remove the sleeves also supports its “duvet-ness.” The duvet coat is not part of the replica line, but it still continues to show an appreciation for replication, and highlights the industrial basis of replication
	
Re-appropriation is a crucial theme to Margiela’s collections. Every season they produce an Artisanal line (which has been shown as the label’s Haute Couture collection since 2008) that reworks vintage garments to create new combinations.  This connects back to the theme of deconstruction as Margiela is redefining the usage of a garment and giving it a new life. The Artisanal line also shows Margiela’s interest in fashion history. Through this interest in history, Margiela is able to deconstruct the notion of innovation in fashion. This can be seen in repeated editioning the of Duvet Coat. For the Autumn/Winter 1999-2000 collection, the Artisanal line was concerned partially with the creation of duvet cover for the coat. So, although the coat is innovative and new, it still owes a debt to the past through the covers and also through its construction. There is another layer of appropriation in that the the duvet covers can be re-worn as a dress, further questioning the expectations about what a duvet cover (or any other item of clothing or furnishing) should or should not do. 
	
Although the Duvet coat is not explicitly indicative of Maison Martin Margiela’s conceptions about what clothes should mean and do, it still contains traces of these themes. To continue the story of the Duvet coat, in 2012 it was part of a collection of re-editions that were replicated in a collaboration between the fast fashion company H&amp;M and Margiela. It is telling that they chose to reproduce the Duvet coat and it perhaps indicates that Margiela felt that it was one of the pieces that best represented their feelings about the meaning behind their clothing.

there are basically three kinds of internet 'fashion' resources-- shitty tumblrs, big aggregates like hypebeast/highsnobiety/selectism, and communities/forums like MFA, sufu, SF, etc.  

When i started posting to reddit a year ago, r/malefashion was basically a combination of the first two, curated almost entirely by u/raiseyourglass.  it was really dead for about a year, and teckneaks has taken it upon himself to do something with this place, for which i applaud him.  the WAYWT's we've had are small but intimate.  not that we can't do better, but for once this sub has some actual content.

since his initiative this place hasn't blown up but we can all agree the content is basically better.  the users are generally more knowledgable and interested in fashion as a hobby, not as a means to a look acceptable/get laid/get the job/etc.  about 60% of the content comes from these users.  the rest is from users who stumble in here, maybe don't know about MFA, and is basically banal, pedestrian shit that should be on MFA.  i think the place could use a little stricter moderating as to what hits the front page, but we also have so little content that it's not an issue yet.

MFA has a special place in my heart and we can't talk about this place without talking about MFA but MFA also sucks dick.   seeing people go +30 in recent purchases week after week for buying aldens and epaulet chinos kills the penis.  

I know teckneaks wants (wanted?) to take this place in a different direction from MFA but i honestly think the MFA schema works fine.  i would love to see this place be formally similar but different (better) content wise-- a tighter group of people with more directed interests.  i'd be happy to see and contribute to recent purchase/gen discussion type threads here-- happy to continue WIWT, happy to talk about designers (someone seriously needs to make a Thom Grey thread), etc.  we have a bunch of good users from MFA like teckneaks, n1c, y_control et al -- we have a decent amount of users from the MFA irc community.  it wouldnt take much more to bring up the discourse here.  i love the sufu community, and it's impossible to reproduce in MFA but i think this place has some promise?

In part due to them being kops brought upon by me being solely in hype, but in other parts due to the fact that as a person my style is still evolving. This growth, and desire for my style to achieve a certain look undoubtedly clashes with ones finances at times. 

However the main thing that I've been reflecting over - which is related to my personal growth in fashion - is the notion of contentedness one can achieve in their wardrobe: you see what you possess and feel happy. To me, I feel as though its hard to differentiate between contentedness and complacency. In my view complacency breeds laziness; invoking a sartorial stagnation. It's just that I can't seem to find how this is different than being content, is it possible to separate the two? How can you be at ease with your style, while simultaneously being able to havedesires? Moreover, is it necessary to achieve a contentedness in ones personal fashion? I don't mean being caught up in a perpetual hype-cycle constantly flipping things on B&amp;S - I mean being in a constant state of wanting to improve, and being at your peak?

These are things that have been on my mind lately, and just wanted to post these to have a group discussion, and see what others have to say. ",,False,self,t5_2seq5,False,,,True,t3_19054j,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/19054j/contentedness_vs_complacency_and_other_musings_on/,

I'll include here a bit of info about the pattern, and an example. In this thread we're going to invite discussion (history, importance, present status in the fashion world and so on) as well as examples from your personal closets. 

A bit of info, taken from Wikipedia:

**Design and history:**

Houndstooth checks originated in woven wool cloth of the Scottish Lowlands, but are now used in many other materials. The traditional houndstooth check is made with alternating bands of four dark and four light threads in both warp and weft/filling woven in a simple 2:2 twill, two over/two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass. In an early reference to houndstooth, De Pinna, a New York City–based men's and women's high end clothier founded in 1885, included houndstooth checks along with gun club checks and Scotch plaids as part of its 1933 spring men's suits collection.

In case you haven't been over to /r/bestof2012, the whole format has changed, essentially leaving it up to each individual subreddit to choose its own method picking winners. Rather than go into full detail myself, I'm going to just copypasta the original post and let you all read it for yourselves:

&gt;How does it work?

&gt;1. We'd like to encourage you, the mods, to start planning your own best &gt;of nominations and awards within your communities. Ideally these would be voted on by the members of your community. Come up with interesting and fun categories (most citations in /r/askscience? saddest poem in /r/poetry?), and engage your subreddits to pick out their favorite stuff of the year (even from other subreddits, if you want to!).
&gt;2. Let's get organized together in /r/bestof2012. Instead of being a staging area for nominations and awards, this year let's use it to aggregate all of the best of threads in each community, turning it into a single starting point where people can dive into all of the cool stuff from the past year.
&gt;3. We'll promote /r/bestof2012 across the site and in our 2012 wrap up blog post. We will also, by request, provide 5 gold creddits for subreddits with over 500 subscribers to award to the winners of their own best of ceremonies.

&gt;We may make some changes or announce additional tweaks based on your feedback as we get closer to awards time. Please use /r/bestof2012 to stay abreast of updates.

&gt;We have a few weeks to get this underway, and we're going to need everyone's help and participation to make this a success. Inspired or have an awesome idea for a subreddit? Start up a discussion and trade notes. Want to help out with /r/bestof2012? Let's get in touch!

So, what do you guys think? **We have up to 5 Reddit Gold one-month credits to give away**- who should get them, and why? Best post? Best comment? Most original look? Help us choose the categories, and then help us choose the winners!

I'm going to go ahead and outline a couple possible categories, and the ones you guys like- upvote and nominate in, and if you don't see a category you like, add it and nominate under it!",,False,self,t5_2seq5,1355605865.0,,,True,t3_14wr7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/14wr7j/rmalefashion_best_of_2012_awards/,moderator

Since we're gaining notriety, I guess it's time to clean up the sidebar a bit. That wall of text was my original 'rant' of a reason to create this sub. I was tired of the 'same old same old' stuff in MFA, and wanted a place for inspiration and new ideas. Clarks DBs get old real fast, ya know?

So I guess the question is, what should we put in the sidebar instead? I'm open to ideas. Also, anyone interested in styling this sub up a bit? It feels... plain, haha.

I live in the city, during the summer it could get up to 40C (100F roughly).  

Now, I would describe myself as a leather jacket/rick owens/drape/blazer/boots kinda guy.  Obviously all of those are out of the window in this heat.  I also don't like showing my legs so my options become much more limited in the summer.  Plus honestly, in the summer it's so hot that I sometime just don't feel like giving a shit - by the time I get dressed up I am already sweating, and my hair is sagging from the humidity.  My mood is usually completely destroyed when I start getting sticky and sweaty.

The other day I was walking around center city in my T-shirt and jeans, and I saw some guys wearing full blown suits.  Assuming they are wearing an undershirt, that's 2 article of clothing + the heavy blazer.  Just looking at them made me hot and rage.  I have no idea how they could do that, I wish I have that kind of heat endurance.

People who are educated in the higher levels of fashion are encouraged to contribute. I'm looking at germinal, cameronrgr, trashpile, teckneaks, superhomme/solar_garden, and the likes. I know you guys know a lot about a specific designer (like germinal and Jil and trashpile and undercover) so you should expound upon when those threads come up. The purpose of these threads will be to provide background info, explanations, and opinions on designers or styles or whatever fashion related subjects that aren't readily understandable. It's for people (like myself) who want to get into 'the next level', for lack of a better term, but who aren't quite there yet.*

Anyways, help me Get It: Raf Simons.

I was checking out rafsimons.com today. First thing you see is the film on SS13 and it's quite something. It's weird. I can't really describe it to justce, but you should check it out and give me your opinion on what it means. I was looking at the 'archive' section, and it's like a weird maze of links, 30 of them, each linking to another section. It's not really organized in any specific way, and the music changes with each picture. I spent a minute or two on each picture, trying to gain some kind of extra meaning from it but I realized that it's basically impossible with out being a close follower of his designs or reading up on editorialized reports on him.

Also, this: http://rafsimonsredux.tumblr.com/post/31894237536/spring-summer-2003-can-executed-by-atelier-elf

It looks damn cool, but what does it mean? Does it mean anything in the first place? I like to think (and this is transitioning into another topic altogether) that every visual aspect an artist like Raf Simons engages in HAS to have some central theme, or message. Especially in a field that deals exclusively in visual literature, anything that Raf found worthy of publishing in Raf Simons Redux must be of some contextually discovered importance.

What strikes me is that I never saw that model anywhere, more ""cat-eye""ish than the original Wayfarers ... Has somebody in here good knowledge about this model ? Is it old, rare or is it a bad fake ? Just for information, I'm living in Belgium, maybe that'll help.

[Here's a visual comparison between the Target one and a mainline TB blazer](http://imgur.com/a/qsEID). 

Sorry I'm wearing different clothes in each picture...I was actually just planning on picking up kitty litter so that's what I happened to be wearing.

For reference, I normally wear a 40S. The target blazer is a size M and the TB blazer is a size 2. TB fits me really well off the rack, the only alterations I had done on the TB blazer were to shorten the sleeves a little bit (I have short arms). 

I would say the Target blazer I tried on would be well suited for someone who wears a 40R. It's cut a little more conservatively with wider lapels, a lower button stance, and longer arms. Shortening the sleeves much is going to be tough because the button holes are functional with the signature TB grosgrain.

I didn't buy it but I was actually pretty impressed, given that it's only $150, 100% wool (lining is polyester though), and they didn't cut any corners in terms of TB detailing.

I'm reposting here in hopes that it will get more traction. I've added the few suggestions provided and can add more as they come in. Although it may technically be a personal request, my ultimate goal is to have a good list which may then be applied to the side bar.* 

Good Day All,

Over the course of my sartorial adventures I've found my preference lean towards a more European fit and style. That is, Northern Europe and the UK. Not so much Southern Europe, but that's just personal pref. The few items I've brought back with me, when there has been an opportunity to travel, sit marvelously on my atypical frame. Although analogues can be found from american retailers the fit always seems to be a bit off.

I've been searching for online retailers that sell and ship at a reasonable price to NA. Here's what I've got so far. If you've ordered from any of them, please feel free to comment on the fit/price/quality/etc..

- [ASOS](http://www.asos.com/) is pretty obvious.
- I've had some luck with [Herrenausstatter](http://www.herrenausstatter.de/)
- [Boozt](http://www.boozt.com/eu/en) out of Sweden looks ok, but I haven't ordered anything yet.
- [Zara](http://www.zara.com/) another popular choice. 
- [River Island](http://www.riverisland.com/) Low prices and ships just about anywhere
- [Chemical Rrecords UK](http://http://www.chemical-records.co.uk) Street/Skate with a touch of haberdashery

I thought this would be a good opportunity for our well traveled members or perhaps those who live in Europe to offer suggestions.

Thanks.

I'm not trying to talk about the politics and economics or even the ultimate ethics of factories and sweatshops; that's a bit beyond me. But there was something heartbreaking about reading quotes of people buried for days lamenting their survival in this flowery prose. I guess it's just the translation, but I think if I can, I'd like to buy items from places where this doesn't happen.

So yeah, if people want to post some of their favorite MIA brands and talk about what they like about them, that'd be cool. I can't really start the discussion off with anything else except American Apparel. I think they make great basics and even though people knock the quality, their clothes last me fine. I haven't bought anything in a while but their oxfords fit me well and, on sale, are at a fair price.

",13,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/185ua4/another_look_at_branding_with_comme_des_garcons/,"Whenever I see a rack of $120 [CdGPlay t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/G3y7Vup.jpg), I find myself a little repulsed as I silently mock the sheeple who are willing to throw away their money for a stupid heart with slanty eyes. 

Whenever I see a [CdGH+ t-shirt](http://i.imgur.com/wickNyI), I want it. Such a brilliant satire of the our branded culture. Sure it costs twice as much as a CdGPlay shirt and it is probably made in the same factory but it is art. While CdGPlay participates in the hype culture as [just](http://i.imgur.com/J0S80Ty) [another](http://i.imgur.com/69VP5x5) [cash rake](http://i.imgur.com/3MqYHwo), CdGH+ transcends it and treats our culture as a subject of critique.

Ok, I'm being facetious and completely exaggerating but I do feel some association with these thoughts. Such polar opposite reactions to two lines from the same brand this, I feel, is the genius that is [Rei Kawakubo](http://i.imgur.com/ECuziuM.jpg). She has really forced me to re-evaluate my ideas of branding and how I incorporate them into what I wear/carry.

Her CDGH+ menswear line began in 1984 and from the very beginning, there is one idea that has recurred throughout her collections: the reversible jacket. [This a jacket from the mid-80's.](http://i.imgur.com/ifLDcdx.jpg) The reversibility doesn't even come from some unique construction feature. It is as simple as taking any one of her jackets and wearing it inside out. The collar is all wonky and buttons face the inside. The inside pockets show and lining is all wrinkled.

Here is a SS1999 show where every jacket is reversible and she shows each piece worn both ways.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGR4Ct5OkuA&amp;t=5m46s
[and some pictures from the show.](http://imgur.com/a/7rBa0)

[Here are a few more pictures from a AW2002 show.](http://imgur.com/a/u0vWt)

The interesting part is how the CdGH+ label is worn as a badge and there is also a CdGH+ loop tag on the back, outside collar. I believe that it is intended (I'm not entirely sure) that every single jacket from all of her collections can be worn reversed if you want to show off the brand.

With the past decade, she took a turn and started adding more of the CdGH+ branding to pieces in her collections and she started associating the brand with other pop culture references.

[Star Wars](http://i.imgur.com/HyT2DXA)

[Rolling Stones](http://i.imgur.com/spG093R)

[Pink Panther](http://i.imgur.com/4ha0DB0)

I don't have any big conclusion but I think CdGPlay, CdGH+, and CdG Shirt all offer interesting ways to incorporate branding. I hope others can add to this thread with more interesting ways to incorporate branding into outfits and I'll add some more pictures to the comments later.

'summer is bad for fashion [sic]' - germinal may 2012


I don't think this is true but I think  it's bad for the people who use a bunch of clothes to hide from.  I think mfa loves layering partially because you can hide your bad posture or face or low confidence in all those colors and textures and ideas.  for instance if you compare mclankylegs fit with the original derk shot the difference isn't at all in the clothes, it's that derk oozes swagger and you can see it in the shot.  (no hate just an example I thought of)

in the summer you have so fewer clothes to hide behind.  a t shirt reveals your body more than an ocbd.  you can't use some gimmicky garment combination to draw attention from yourself.  generally you have a lot less to work with so it's a much more minimalist affair

that was a bit of a tangent, what is everyone's uniform this summer?  I'm back to my old ways, button ups over t shirts, shorts, sneakers without socks.  a long sleeve tied around the waist is truly the best way for a man to capture the volume and look of a skirt",,False,self,t5_2seq5,False,,,True,t3_1c09r7,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/1c09r7/today_is_the_first_day_of_summer/,

It's been about a month since we started up the weekly threads, from suggestions that you all gave.... so the question now is, what do you think? 

Mondays have been 'What I Wore Today' thread, focusing on allowing members to show off their wicked style.

Tuesdays have been 'What He Wore Today', a new to reddit. Here we have been asking users to post photos of OTHER people. Street photos were the original intent, but the threads have been lots of lookbook/fashion show/ad photos so far, although certainly showing some interesting stuff.

Wednesdays is Shopping List day - what you just bought, or are hoping to buy in the next week. Some certainly cool stuff has popped up in these threads.

Thursdays are another new to reddit - Item of the Week. We've done, among other things, shoes, jackets, and ties. Involvement in this one has been growing, but seems to be very dependent on the actual item chosen.

So what are your thoughts? Which threads do you like? Which don't you like? Suggestions for modifications to current ones? Replacements? Re-orderings?

Let us know!

Lots of great avant garde fits.

However, I just turned 30, and I can't really see myself wearing sweats or sneakers. I could have seen it 15 years ago, but not really now. Of course, 10 years ago I never thought I'd see myself in skinny jeans. 

So, specifically, can us old guys look like anything but tryhards in streetwear? I remember ten years ago looking at the balding guy in chuck taylors and thinking: ""I never want to be that guy."" Would I be that guy?  If the answer is yes, can you furnish pics, other than of milky_funk? 

More generally, how do you guys see age affecting fashion choices? Should I just slink off into menswear and get a suit for the daytime and some weekend warrior wear?

Lastly, I wonder how much of this change I am perceiving in styles isn't just brought about by the MFA/MF demographic getting younger as the subs grow.

So, my question is: is this a flash in the pan, some idiosyncratic wardrobe choices of which I am making to much? Or is streetwear evolving to look more like goth/ninja? 

Cause that would be awesome. I really like the goth/ninja silhouettes, but I could not be seen in public in  most of it. This spread seems to suggest that you could embrace the more unusual silhouettes of goth/ninja while maintaining the acceptability of a streetwear look.

Since this is the center for male fashion, I thought I might pick your brain for a second.

Basically, I'm doing my research, and I want to know what you look for in the perfect place to shop. What colors do you like (for the building/walls/floor/ceiling; not the clothes), what material do you like (again for the interior, not the clothes), what makes you comfortable, what do you wish stores had that they really don't, what things do stores have that you think makes your shopping experience better, what sort of window displays make you want to go into a store? I want to know what makes you want to go shopping in a store. I appreciate your help in my precedent work. I am going to ask around in my circle of friends, but being from a southern state where there is a lack of retail store options, most of us have not been exposed to top-notch stores, which is why I have turned to Reddit.

(Specifically regarding suits etc.),11,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/17drut/is_it_possible_to_dress_fashionably_while_in_a/,"I have always been a fan of high fashion, and really like wearing and styling myself in these clothes.

Recently however, I have attained a job offer in a rather conservative industry, and with a rather rigorous dress code (Font office for a prominent investment bank.).  Specifically, suits, pretty much all day, every work day.  

While I have worn suits, they were mostly for occasional use, and thus I didn't focus too much on them. 

However, soon, I may need to be wearing a suit pretty much five+ days a week, and this scares me.  I get the feeling I will be surrounded by people who, may have a sense of style, but have absolutely no sense of fashion, and I do not want to turn into one of these people.

Unfortunately, wearing ""fashionable suits"" such as [Dior Homme](http://www.style.com/slideshows/2012/fashionshows/S2013MEN/CDMEN/runway/00010fullscreen.jpg) or [Yohji Yamamoto](http://www.style.com/slideshows/2012/fashionshows/S2013MEN/YJIYMOTO/RUNWAY/00140fullscreen.jpg), for example, are sure to get me fired, forget anything from [Ann Demeulemeester](http://www.style.com/slideshows/2012/fashionshows/S2013MEN/ADEMEULE/RUNWAY/00170fullscreen.jpg) or similar.

My question is, is it even possible to dress fashionably in a suit?  And if so, could you provide any tips? Or should I just give up on fashion, and just dress conservatively, in which case, I'll probably pass on the job.  

I will need to go out and purchase a few more suits if I decide to take this job, and want to get some advice before I lose a job and a few thousand dollars.  Thank you very much.

tl;dr, moving from streetwear to suits every day.  How to stay fashionable?

I'll step up and make this thread since it's been on my mind and it was basically [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/zcw6h/lets_have_another_discussion_about_this_place/). I'm going to assume if you hate Thom Browne you think this sucks too, but for those of us who like him, what do you all think about the line?

My thoughts:

* Thom Browne has no idea how a diffusion line works. Ties are a little more affordable, but most clothes are still crazy expensive. [$335 for a rugby shirt](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Grey-Wide-Striped-Rugby-Shirt/502141247,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=4) and $290 vs $195 for an oxford is still out of reach for most people. [Thom Browne varsity jacket is $1340](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Browne-Letterman-Jacket/502064155,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=25) and [Thom Grey varsity jacket s $1180](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Grey-Striped-Letterman-Jacket/502141407,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=14).

* While we're on the subject, why the fuck did he ruin that varsity jacket by writing GREY on the back? Would have been awesome otherwise.

* Barney's does a terrible job styling Thom Browne. Most of these pictures make the clothes look awful.

* I like a few items, like [this cardigan](http://www.barneys.com/Thom-Grey-Rugby-Stripe-Cardigan/502141151,default,pd.html?cgid=men&amp;index=12) and the scarves, but not for that price.

I'd love to be able to find some replacements, but the Internet isn't turning up anything outside of women's clothing or $100 pastel shirts from upscale designers. I was hoping that /r/malefashion might have a lead on an affordable retailer of such shirts.

We couldn't find the exact ones, but found [these](http://www.doversaddlery.com/SSG%20Lycrochet%20Horseshoe%20Back%20Riding%20Gloves/p/X1-3996/tid/MintFinder/?zmam=1460880&amp;zmas=6&amp;zmac=99&amp;zmap=0003996007080X1-3996&amp;re=viewbuyrec) on Dover Saddlery. I bought them just for fun, and while they were pretty cool, they turned out to be pretty small on me. So I am giving them away here. Please double check that they will fit you according to the rules on the website. The diameter of your hand at it's widest point should be 9 inches. They do work well for driving because they are are fairly short (don't ride up on the wrist), however they are annoying because they aren't made for touch screen phones, so you have to slide them off slightly.

**GIVEAWAY**
Terms: I will send [my brand new pair](http://imgur.com/a/dnTB9) free of charge (CONUS only please, sorry) to the person who can get their best joke the most upvotes in this post.
