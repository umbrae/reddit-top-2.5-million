We're going to run an experiment.

For one week, only comments from non-default subreddits may be posted here.

The current default set is as follows:

* AdviceAnimals

* aww
* bestof
* blog
* funny
* gaming
* IAmA
* movies
* Music
* pics
* politics
* science
* technology
* todayilearned
* videos
* worldnews
* WTF

There have been a lot of comments here voicing displeasure at seeing the popular comments from the top of /r/AskReddit and other subreddits featured here in /r/bestof.

At the end of the week we will post a follow-up.

As I’m sure you know, the week-long trial of excluding the default subreddits has drawn to a close. Some of you loved it, some of you hated it, and you definitely let us know about it. There has been plenty of community feedback, both positive and negative:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xylrj/just_wanted_to_say_ive_absolutely_loved_this/

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y0rpe/were_on_day_5_of_our_weeklong_no_defaults/ 

The moderation team has discussed this issue up one side and down another. As moderators, we regularly have to make controversial decisions. When a community is as divided as this subreddit currently is, any action by the moderators (even inaction) is bound to make someone unhappy. In fact, it’s bound to make many someones unhappy. We’ve examined the subreddit very closely both before and after the change, and noticed a marked increase in both the quality and diversity of the submissions when the default subreddits were removed from the mix. According to our community poll, the majority of the userbase agrees. The moderators held a vote, and unanimously decided to extend the ban on default subreddits indefinitely. **As of this post, and until further notice, /r/bestof will no longer allow comments from default subreddits to be submitted here.**

Quality and diversity aren’t the only reasons for this change, however. One of the most requested features on /r/ideasfortheadmins is a way of discovering new subreddits. By removing default subreddits from the mix here, we’ve stumbled upon a golden opportunity for reddit in that regard. This is a great way for our subreddit to expose redditors to communities beyond the default set. Every new user who signs up for reddit is going to see an excellent submission from a subreddit they’ve likely never heard of on their main page each day. Not only does this change open the door for subreddit discovery on the front page, but at the same time it is instrumental in helping new communities grow and prosper.

* /r/WritingPrompts jumped from 237 users to 2771 thanks to being [featured here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xvq71/a_redditor_is_given_a_prompt_to_write_a_story_but/c5q2m4v?context=1). That’s a pretty significant spike in traffic, and means the difference between a struggling new community vs. a prospering, self-sustainable one.

* /r/sex gained over [1,000 subscribers](http://imgur.com/a/J8htP) after being [featured here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xr1cr/learn_how_pleasure_of_female_sex_organs_work_nsfw/).

* /r/olympics topped that with over [2,000 new users](http://i.imgur.com/ytvim.png) after sitting at the top spot of /r/bestof all day. Not to mention, the thread was featured on both [The Colbert Report](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/417496/august-07-2012/sport-report---stephen-colbefrajilympic-expealacoverage----soft-anti-americanism) (skip to 3:55) and [The Daily Show](http://i.imgur.com/Bsx3o.jpg)!

These are just a few examples of what has been happening every single day this week. To document what I like to call “The /r/bestof Effect,” /u/redditbots has agreed to start monitoring the subreddit. His bot will automatically take a screenshot of each thread mere minutes after it’s submitted to /r/bestof, and not only will it offer a glimpse of what the thread looked like before /r/bestof had its way with it, it will show how far the subscription count has jumped. He currently provides his excellent service to the meta community /r/SubredditDrama, and I would like to thank him for extending that service to /r/bestof as well.

We are also toying with the idea of holding a “Default Subreddit Megathread” once per week, held by a bot, that will provide a space for our community to discuss the hidden gems that just so happen to be found in a default subreddit. 

I know some of you aren’t very happy with us right now, but unfortunately, we can’t please everyone. We can, however, promote a few alternative subreddits that address some of the concerns users had about missing out on content:

* /r/defaultgems - a counterpart to /r/bestof. Subscribe to both!

* /r/tldr - a daily recap of reddit brought to you by /u/qgyh2

* /r/dailydot - a community newspaper to catch up on reddit for the day

Thank you.

Since then, our [moderation bot](/u/AutoModerator) has been automatically removing any submission that links to a default subreddit. The results have been interesting, to say the least.

One side effect is that there has been a sharp increase in meta posts recently ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xz22y/how_many_people_dislike_the_exclusion_of_the/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xy0rb/request_change_the_domain_link_on_each_post_to/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xylrj/just_wanted_to_say_ive_absolutely_loved_this/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/)), and I *do* apologize for adding to the problem, if you consider that to be a problem. Personally, I always enjoy a good meta discussion, but I digress. Let's get down to business.

I want to conduct a poll to see exactly how the community stands on the issue. Keep in mind that polling on reddit can be extremely unreliable (there are always problems with vote cheating and influence from other subreddits), and in no way do I want to tie the other moderators' hands in regards to the direction of this subreddit. However, I think a poll might help a few mods who are on the fence one way or another finally make up their mind about how they want to vote on this policy decision. Before I link the poll, I want to quote a few comments that members of our community have made both in favor and against the experiment, and let you make up your mind on your own...

---

**In favor:**

&gt;I've been upvoting far more often than I usually do. It's really interesting, as opposed to the usual ""Oh... yeah, I remember that comment, it was funny.""

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qox2e

&gt;Why are we trying to accommodate the people who use bestof as a way to unsubscribe from the default subs and still have their feed full of the small bit of those subs that have something useful? That's not what bestof is for. The inclusion of the default subs naturally leads them to monopolize the visible content in this subreddit, satisfying only the people who want to use the toilet without cleaning it (everybody poops). But the people who are satisfied by this aren't contributing to bestof, because they, by their own admission, have zero potential to submit content that will be seen, because they intentionally don't subscribe to the subreddits they come here to read. bestof is a subreddit where you share great comments with other people so that people who have missed those comments can see them. It is not a place where you share great comments with other people so that people who have intentionally and specifically gone out of their way to avoid those comments can see them. The entitlement! The parasitism! I see no reason to suffer it.

&gt;It would be great if we could include default subreddits and not have these characters ruin everything else, but the only way to do this would be to trust the very causes of this problem to spontaneously change their attitude. In other words, we can't. So why bother?

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qqo6c

&gt;I love the change. I'm subbed to most of the default subreddits still, so I already see the top comments to those threads.

&gt;Not only am I seeing rad comments I wouldn't have seen otherwise, but I'm also finding SUBREDDITS I wouldn't have known about otherwise. It's a double win.

&gt;I suggest making a bestof for the defaults. Though, you could tell everyone to just re subscribe to the defaults and be less of a lazy twat and read the damn top comments yourself without needing a subreddit to spoonfeed it to you. They're default for a reason.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qr9j3

---

**Against:**

&gt;As someone who's unsubscribed from several of the default subs, I'm probably missing out on good stuff. So that sucks.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qplp2

&gt;I know a lot of people are loving this, but I personally am not a huge fan. /r/bestof is for, like the name says, the best of reddit. I simply feel that because more people visit the default subs, some of the highest (and lowest) quality comments can be found there. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for other subs being posted on here more often, but I know for a fact that I will be missing out on some great comments if we take away the defaults because I don't check the comments section of every post. And that's probably the same for several other redditors as well.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qpg6k

&gt;I will say that I am enjoying the quality of the submissions as of late but that being said I do think we are missing something from not allowing defaults in. The reasoning I have is that we all do not spend the same amount of time on reddit. When I check and askreddit thread in the morning the top comment may be entirely different than if I were to check it in the afternoon. For all I know it may not have even been submitted yet. But once I read the askreddit thread once, I will hardly ever go back and re-read it to make sure I didn't miss anything.
My point is that not everyone sees all the default subs, so even though the quality may be poorer, I think they still should be allowed. If you don't want to read things from a certain subreddit then do not click on the links that take you there. That way we still may get the great comments from all across reddit as bestof is supposed to be.

Lots of people expressed their support for my efforts, given the poor availability of equipment and then **XenonOfArcticus** suggested [donations for purpose of increasing pet adoption by having better photos advertised](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/lfdnj/i_volunteer_for_local_humane_society_and_take_cat/c2sa9zx).

Then two days after the original post **SoaringDodo** sends me a pm with exactly that intention.

You can imagine the rest of the story... 

**Here's the obligatory: [Look what came in the mail today](http://i.imgur.com/RBqVp.jpg)** Ups, sorry! Technical trouble there. 

Here is [what came in the mail](http://i.imgur.com/NGa7G.jpg). 

Which I took to [the shelter the same day](http://i.imgur.com/DochS.jpg). 

We have very poor website but you can at least see [this photo taken with the new equipment](http://www.petango.com/Adopt/Cat-Domestic-Shorthair-Mix-14358691). Camera is very fast [even on Auto and with flash](http://i.imgur.com/ZyZop.jpg) and that is very important at the shelter.

But here is what made this story even more special for me: Spending past few months at the shelter and being witness to many horrific stories of neglect and cruelty to animals really took a toll on me.

 My nihilism all flared up and I started closing off to people. And then this total stranger comes along at restores my faith in humanity *(at least for a while)*. 

Not just that he donated his $400 camera in PERFECT condition with accessories, but he actually made sure that we get the most of his effort and **bought a brand new lens on Amazon** and had it shipped to me.


So on behalf of shelter animals of Yakima county, staff and volunteers of Humane Society here and my *(better)* self: **One big Thank You SoaringDodo of Reddit fame!**

**May the karma rain upon you and all your endeavors**.


**TL;DR** (I post picture of crummy photo equipment from local animal shelter, another Redditor sends his nice camera and buys a new lens as donations to the shelter)

**EDIT 1:** Thank you all on Reddit! Please make sure to upvote **SoaringDodo** and **XenonOfArcticus** below and tell them what you thought of this.

I love the ability to discover new subreddits, great comments, and not have to reread all the top comments I just read on r/askreddit.  However, in the recent weeks without defaults I have felt like something was missing from this subreddit.  I personally believe one of the best aspects of r/bestof is that it has always been an archive of the best and most interesting things ever to happen on reddit.  By sorting by top all time a new redditor or just a nostalgic old one can see the greatest posts in reddit history.  Now that defaults are not allowed some brilliant, hilarious, and heart wrenching posts will be deprived from being classified as the ""bestof' reddit.

Give this flaw I see in our current system I would like to propose a new format for r/bestof (yes I know we just changed, but I honestly believe this would be a great improvement).  This format would be: we continue to not allow default subreddits except for on one day of the week everyweek (once a month may work too). On this day we allow post from anywhere just like before.  With this format we would still be able to have an incredible collection of the best posts in reddit history without having to sort through top comments we just read day in a day out.

TL;DR - Follow current subreddit rules 6 days a week, but allow post from all of reddit on the 7th day.

TL;DR Reddit is awesome.,2028,897,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/dqju7/push_button_receive_bacon_tldr_reddit_is_awesome/,"Krakkagar, a redditor from Perth, the place I live, did a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/dpa1r/hey_rperth_im_about_40_minutes_away_from/) explaining that he was about to finish an 11 hour shift at a butchery and asked if anyone wanted meat. I was sceptical, but requested bacon (of course).

I came back the next day to find a little red envelope. I got all giddy and checked to find a reply from Krakkagar. He said what's your address, I'll deliver on Tuesday! I PMd him and we agreed he'd come at 8:30.

I'd made plans with friends for that night and knew I'd have little time between receiving my meat and catching my train. 8:30 came but still no sign of Krakkagar. 8:45 came and I was getting twitchy because the train station is a decent 20 minute walk and my train was approaching. 8:50 came and there was still no sign of Krakkagar so I had to run.

I had a great night and when I returned, I'd totally forgotten about my little meat rendezvous until I found [this](http://imgur.com/wrl53.jpg) note at my front door. It reads:
&gt;Dear Sagerian,
&gt;I hereby pronounce ಠ_ಠ upon myself for not honouring our agreed apointment. I almost had a pregnant when the big boss man told me 
&gt;it was the night to clean the entire display. 
&gt;
&gt;Yours faithfully, Krakkagar
&gt;
&gt;Fuck Bitches
&gt;
&gt;P.S. PM me when you get this and you'll get a tasty reward.

When I hopped on reddit I was red again with a message from Krakkaga saying check your door. I replied saying I was sorry I missed him. He messaged again and I told him I'd be up for quite a while.

An hour or so later the doorbell rings. I hear ""bacon delivery"". I said something to the effect of: ""oh wow, I didn't think you'd still be up!"" he said ""Yeah, I was playing minecraft"". He handed me my [bacon](http://imgur.com/ZKPFj.jpg) and said ""See you on the internet!"".

And with that my new bacon delivery friend was gone.

The people in my house were pretty confused.

""He just brought you bacon at 2:30 in the morning?.. For free o_0""

If anything, it's restored my faith in humanity, just a little bit.

And cured my pretty horrible hangover this morning.

Thank you so much Krakkagar for my tasty bacon, and thanks to reddit for being such an amazing community!

TL;DR: Redditor promises bacon, and delivers!

At my dad's funeral.,1801,736,244,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/dndfy/i_tried_standup_for_the_first_time_at_my_dads/,"This is the speech I told recently at my father's funeral.  I went up at the very end of the service so people could leave with a smile, just like my dad would have wanted. 

I killed with it.  Dad would have loved it.  I hope you all do too.

---------------

 

When you’re a child, you learn a lot of incredible things.  Your mind is blown on a regular basis.  What goes up, must come down.  What cold is and what hot is.  What you can do and what you can’t do.  The earth goes around the sun.  What family means.  What it means to love them.

As you get older, these grand realizations get further and farther between.  Learning how an engine works.   What government does.  The difference between a pay rate and a pay check.  Then pretty soon, you just don’t have any of those moments anymore.

Then, a moment comes around that rearranges your entire universe.  It’s the opposite of all the previous realizations.  Instead of knowing the cause but not the effect, you’re aware of the inevitable but completely unprepared for the outcome.

September 13th was that moment for me. 

My dad was the greatest man I’ve ever met.  I would frequently hear people who knew him tell me “You are just like your father”.  I would only be able to muster out something about how I was far more handsome than him, which is clearly true... but was mostly for comedic effect.  But what I’d always wanted to tell them was how much of a compliment I believed that to be.  However, an affliction that my dad and I both have intervened:  We love making people laugh during uncomfortable situations.

We would argue all the time about politics.  His crazy ultra-right wing lock up the borders and give guns to invalids talk against my rhythm-nation common man Marxist rants.  We would battle for hours, spouting statistics, proposing scenarios.  We both loved it.  And after hours of dogged fighting, either we would realize that we were both basically arguing the same point, or my mom would come in and scream at us both to shut up.

But, like I said, if there’s any one thing that my dad and I shared, besides this breathtaking visage, it was our love for making people laugh.  Thanksgiving dinner was a time to get everyone together and doing the other thing we both truly loved…  making fun of my mom.  Whether it was the smoke alarm signaling that whatever was in the oven was ready, or trying to have her remember a joke or read something aloud.  We had a blast with it.  I hope all of you will pick up where my dad and I left off and ask my mom to tell a joke or read anything aloud.  And don't feel too bad.  You can tease her all you want, she won't remember anyways.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but after I heard, I started thinking of jokes.  It's a defense mechanism.  It's what we did with bad news.  They were how he made others feel at ease, so it's only fitting that I attempt to make you all laugh uncomfortably.  If any of these really do make you feel uncomfortable, just know that my dad would think they are funny.

So here I am... doing exactly what my father would have been proud of me for:  Milking this bereavement time for all that it’s worth! 

I'm not sure exactly what my dad died from.  Something called a myocardial infarction, whatever that is.  I'm pretty sure it actually happened because he finally found the chain-email that he didn’t send that threatened something terrible would happen the next day if he didn't forward it.  Ether that or did someone told him that Obama got a second term.  For both of you that don't know, my dad was a diehard Republican and gun nut.  He MAY have mentioned it.  If the cable news was out for more than a hour, he didn't have opinions anymore.  Actually, now that I think of it, this may have just been his way out of getting Social Security. 

We always joked that I'd be changing his diapers when he’s old.  I'd say ""I'll have people for that by then"".  Turns out I won't have to do that indignity for my parents.  That means you too mom.  If anyone knows a good nursing home, we're going to need one for my mom...  really soon too. 

*Pats stomach*  I grew this gut just for this occasion.  That's just like normal...  Everyone laughs at that joke but my dad.  Only kidding...  of course my dad went to the gym steadfastly, once every nine months.

He was also right in the middle of refinishing the cabinets in the kitchen.  I guess he REALLY didn’t want to have to finish those.  We will add this to the list of unfinished projects.

I probably could have been a really great rockstar.  But my picture perfect upbringing from loving parents ruined all of that.  I couldn't get any rage from anywhere!  What could I possibly be mad at?  Scream about my mom and dad still chasing each other around like schoolkids?  All that gross kissing and hugging?  Or their hilarious little fights where they weren't talking to each other? 

Here's some things that I've always wanted to say in front of my Dad but never could:
Ronald Reagan wasn't that great.  
Sarah Palin is an idiot.
There's probably some rap music that you'd like. 
The warranty plan is almost never worth it.
You won't ever need that receipt.  
You don't need that manual.  
You'll never send in that warranty card.  
The neighborhood kids are not stealing your internet. 

All bourbon tastes the same to me.  I always thought you were faking it when you could taste the difference.

A law banning giving infants loaded guns is not a ""Slippery slope"".

I never really liked watching football, I just liked watching it with you.

I'd like everyone to remember who my dad was.  He would be the one making you laugh right now if he saw you crying. 

*While crying*  Excuse me, I was backstage cutting some onions.

In closing, I'm jealous of many of you.  Including you, mom.  She got more than 40 years with him.  I only got 32.  But I know that 100 years wouldn't have been enough.",,False,,t5_2qh3v,True,,,True,t3_dndfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/dndfy/i_tried_standup_for_the_first_time_at_my_dads/,

 What is the coolest most spontaneous thing to happen to you while traveling?

from soniaghm
[+1]via  /r/travel/  sent 1 hour ago

In 2005, I was travelling in Italy with my parents. My Dad was in his early 80s, suffering from advanced Parkinson's... but he wanted to see Italy before it was too late. One morning in Venice, he slipped and fell, and had to be taken to the hospital by water ambulance (an adventure in itself!). A couple of hours later, my Mom called me from the hospital--they were releasing him, but couldn't give them a ride back (it was a holiday of some sort), so I needed to take his wheelchair to him.

It was raining when I left the hotel with the folding wheelchair. It only weighed about 20 lbs, but it was large and awkward to carry, and there were 17 bridges (all with stairs) between me and the hospital. I dragged/carried the chair up each flight of stairs and bounced it down. By the third or fourth bridge, my legs were bruised and scraped, my hands hurt, and I was on the edge of tears.

Then, on the next bridge, as I was hauling the chair up, it suddenly grew lighter in my hands. I looked around, and a man in a business suit was supporting one end of it. I thanked him... grazie... and he smiled and nodded. On the next bridge, a young couple with backpacks carried the chair for me. On the next, a pair of nuns assisted me... and so on, all the way to the hospital, across almost every bridge.

On the way back, my father sat in the chair while we were on the level pathways, but we couldn't take him up the stairs in it safely--he had to get out and walk, but he was in a lot of pain. My mother assisted him while I dragged the chair (still with help from numerous strangers!), but it was slow going, and my Mom had a hard time taking his weight.

On one particularly steep set of stairs, there was a young homeless man begging in a doorway. He was emaciated and long-haired--looked like he had stepped out of a painting of the pending martyrdom of a saint. He jumped up, took my father's arm, and helped us across the next few bridges, holding my father tightly, whispering to him in Italian, and stroking his hand gently.
That was the longest, hardest walk of my life--I was exhausted, in pain, and very worried about both my parents--but it restored every shred of faith in humanity that I might have lost in my 38 years of life up until then. The world is full of love and kindness.

tl;dr Had to drag a wheelchair halfway across Venice... unoccupied... and then back the other way, occupied. People helped. :)
