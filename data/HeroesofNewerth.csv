1334315130.0,391,self.HeroesofNewerth,s7rkv,tdM|Tralfamadore: Why I'm finished with Heroes of Newerth and S2 Games,495,104,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/s7rkv/tdmtralfamadore_why_im_finished_with_heroes_of/,"My name is Tralfamadore, formerly of SK-Gaming and now Trademark Esports for Heroes of Newerth.  Throughout my career in HoN, I've managed to make a decent chunk of money through both online and offline tournaments, such as the GosuGamers' World Cup to Dreamhack Winter 2011 to NASL Season 2 Finals, with great success, as well as meet some really wonderful people in the Heroes of Newerth community. 

I am going to talk in great depth about my experiences, my success, and now my frustration with Heroes of Newerth and S2 Games as a whole and why I'm quitting.  This is going to be a long one, but I'm going to do my best to outline my opinions with as little bias as possible but with as much detail as possible, to give you a full scope of where I am coming from. 

The game Heroes of Newerth itself is disgustingly good.  It plays by far better than any MOBA in its genre.  Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.  The response, the animations, the graphics, the turn rates, reduced lag; all of these things can be credited to amazing developers and coders for S2 - what an amazing job they have done.  When I list all of these qualities, in my mind (and I think most others' as well) I'm directly comparing them to characteristics of Dota 2.  I also played a great deal of Dota 1 (and now Dota 2) - I dabbled into some of the top inhouse leagues, but never really got heavily into the scene - unfortunately, at the time I had horrible netlag from college internet, and I played on a horrible laptop that yielded 10 fps tops, and I couldn't download a hotkey script. That's right, I had to click **everything**.  This inhibited me quite a bit - but when HoN came out (as well as my new computer ^^) it had a build in hotkey script that made me fall in love with the game. 

I remember the moment, actually, that I switched from Dota 1 to HoN.  For about 2 weeks, while I was playing in the DXD league on USW, Orie (YoDa) kept spamming /b m whispers saying ""YOU GUYS! You're playing the wrong game - Dota is dead, hon is where it's at.""  Eventually, I got annoyed with his spam and went to try it myself.  I instantly fell in love - between the reconnect feature, smooth gameplay, and the other things I mentioned, it was far superior to Dota in every aspect (at this time, too, about 90% of the heroes in HoN were all DotA ports, so balance was near-perfect).  Many other Dota players, both casual and pro, who have played Hon most all agree that Hon *plays* better.  I found this many months back and found it very interesting: 

http://www.tdabots.com/forums/index.php?/topic/4789-so-i-played-a-game-of-dota/

This is taken from TDA forums, and it was a topic started by Tarano, one of (in my opinion) the strongest players HoN had seen in its time. I never heard of him in Dota 1, sounds like he played on more East leagues or something (old IHL by Ucross, DCL, etc). Anyway, Tarano built up this reputation in the competitors forums (at least in my opinion) of being S2's harshest critic.  Actually, many of his ideas were almost completely parallel to mine in terms of balancing the game. That being said, at the beginning of HoN, Tarano heavily supported HoN over Dota1, with reasons he outlined in that thread: 
""I recommend you to do what I did when I first started HoN. Play a few games of HoN, then go play DotA. After a week of that, I got to know HoN enough to question why I was playing DotA.""
What does this say to me? S2, you now have someone who detests your game and its utter imbalances (I'm just using one person as an example, could list *many, many* others) who used to sing its praises.  That's how far we've come, in terms of balance and keeping the community happy.

After 3 years or more of volunteering my free time to a game I loved, I eventually became too disinterested and inactive to warrant maintaining the status. As such, I think it's time for a nice big post. I warn you now I'm a terrible writer so I'm probably just gonna toss out a wall of rambling.

**The Beginning**

When HoN first entered beta, I got in relatively early through a friend. I was never a big dota player but I had played it ocassionally and had heard about LoL being in development (And expected terrible things simply because of the name). I enjoyed the game and ended up participating on the forums, including making a big mega thread at one point filled to the brim with hero information.

Eventually, as I do with most games, I started tinkering with the game files and I created a simple mod that put all the DotA names for items next to the HoN one in-game. It was crude and imperfect, but it got the job done. With that, mods for HoN were born and an incredible and talented community began to thrive, leading to the later creation of the mod manager. Shortly after I made that first mod and released it in the ""Interface"" section of the forums, it was altered into a modding section with me as the moderator in charge. Around this time, S2 was still a small indie company, with only 20 - 30 people total with nearly half of those being the artist team.

I joined a moderator team along with a number of other really cool people that I'm friends with still to this day. Most of them are listed on the [credits page](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/credits.php) in the 'Moderators' section.

Looking at that list, I wanna quickly go over a couple of them.

**The Cool People**

Nome was one of the first global mods and a great contributor, eventually getting hired by S2 to work on design. He later brought his girlfriend who we all know as MsPudding on board. Both of them are amazing people that I am proud to call friends. As most of you should know however, they no longer work at S2.

China was a moderator for balance and rightfully so as capable of a player as he was. He was opionated though and as anyone might have learned, including myself, that's not generally too welcome in the HoN community, more on this in a bit.

ElementUser, my god what an amazing fellow. He's made so many improvement to HoN and supplied so many fixes to hero glitches it's absurd. HoN would probably be so much more worse off than it is without him.

Sucker is the worst ever, gggg.

Other people that deserve mentions: 

Idejder, who was at first a forum admin and was later hired. He does an insane amount of things for HoN that really don't get recognized. 

Maide, another global moderator who got hired and another very cool guy. 

Bangerz, a fantastic modder for HoN who was eventually made a global mod, and then like others before him, hired at S2.

SoundWizard, the man with the most fitting name, he's a sound design wizard that S2 was smart to hire, the work he does is fantastic.

A recurring theme with a lot of these people is that they were community contributors who eventually got hired. For a short time, S2 even had a junior staff role, which existed solely to recognize some of the moderating team that weren't actually employees. It gave them status as S2, but they weren't on payroll. I believe Tobias and another member of the tech support team were the first to earn that rank, with me being next after them. Eventually though, the rank was being thrown around too easily, and it was nuked.

A lot of you reading this probably recognize most if not all of those people I mentioned, and rightfully so, they're some of the greatest people working at S2. Well, actually, they're about all the great people working at S2.

That's not to say the other members are bad, but they are not as involved as the above were, because the above were all originally part of the community and stayed as that. I'm not trying to overlook people like Fielding, Brad, Gogo or the art team who are all fantastic people, but they along with my above mentions get horribly overshadowed by the ""bad seeds"" of S2.

**The Problems**

~~You know, there isn't really a number of problems with HoN. I have my rather infamous grudge with Diva and I really dislike his design decisions, but ultimately he was not the only person deciding everything. When Diva took over, there was a distinct change in direction for HoN, not controlled by him or any other designer. This change was shortly after the HoN store was implemented. Something that was created for one reason and one reason alone: Money. There is someone at S2 very obsessed with the acquisition of the stuff and I don't doubt it's any surprise to anyone who that is.~~

***The Addendum***

Since I'm under NDA from my fleeting time as Junior S2, I can't speak on certain things I know of internal S2 things and HoN, which is why this is all more of an opinion piece. It's come to light however that Diva might very well be as guilty as Maliken for HoN turning into what it has.

**The One Problem**

Maliken. This man is the poison that has killed HoN and ruined something that really could have been great. Nothing is changed in HoN without Maliken being okay with it and that's probably the worst thing in the world. It's a wonder HoN isn't worse off than it is right now and that's purely because people were able to talk him out of some really horrible ideas. He's a poor decision maker with a temper and he loves to kick down the doors of his employees who are doing their damnedest to create great things and instead have them do something to make him more money. Unfortunately, S2 wouldn't exist without him, since he's the man funding it all from the beginning, and also now pocketing the profits. You'd probably think it a great thing to be working at S2 but Maliken is probably the only one getting anything decent from HoN's success.

If I had to name anything else wrong with HoN, it would most definitely be HoNcast. Breaky and Phil are poor excuses for casters and their partnership with S2 impedes the rise of anyone else who might try to step into the light. Why should anyone try to became a great caster for HoN when S2 has an official outlet for it. To top things off, HoNcast is terrible, they're poor casters and it shows every single time they go live. If you don't watch competitive Starcraft 2, you should know that all of the big name casters for it are actually very capable players themselves, a couple of which were even professional players during the prime of Starcraft 1. Phil and Breaky are not on that same level when it comes to HoN.

**Closing**

Over the last many months, I've slowly lost interest in HoN, and it showed in my activity, thus the reason I was removed from the moderating team. HoN is not the game it used to be, it's devolved into a cash grab, and the passion everyone used to have for it seems to be fading. HoN has lost it's flair, LoL is a thrown together mess that doesn't feel like it meshes, and DotA 2 is plagued by nearly decade old mechanics and design choices that do not play well after the improvements HoN/LoL brought to the table. In the end, I feel like my time contributing to this genre is over. I will still probably play all three at various times, but I think all of them are too far gone for me to ever have the passion for them I once had for HoN.

To Fielding, Jason, Ikkyo, Jamestown, Shawn, Mercenary, Slacker, KingKtulu, Gogo, Phlogiston, Jesse, Shippy, Ari, Cracky, Konran, Chavo, Nome, Idejder, Pudding, Maide, Bangerz, SoundWizard, I give you my thanks for providing me with the game that I had a passion for unlike anything else before and for generally being great people. It has been a horrible experience watching such a fantastic product fade into what it has become; a shadow of it's former self and a mere glimmer of what it had the potential to be.

On the plus side though, I'm sure Maliken's got a fleet of ferrari's at this point, and that's what truly matters.",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,wraith-revenant,True,t3_oa4sp,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/oa4sp/well_i_guess_thats_that/,

(non-fiction)

A chronicle by Catscratch, First of his name, 2012 AD


The tale begins in the first few minutes of one of many countless battles fought in Newerth.  Brown Fayde, who will be referred to under by his heroic appellation Brown Player, was reporting from the offensive lane that ""pred famr.""  We knew things were grim, as the deaths of brown fayde followed by repeated spam of ""gfuk"" ""fuk"" and  ""pred famr"" could mean only one thing - a monster was being created in the depths of legion bottom lane.


The rest of Hellbourne was not faring well either - a Vindicator defensive lane solo was at best trading blows with the legion offensive lane heroes.  Zephyr mid was going well, but as the game progressed, successive deaths were taking a heavy toll on his gpm.  A dark cloud descended on newerth.  All could feel the end coming as the Legion gathered for a push mid-lane, looking to sever Hellbourne reinforcements to that portion of the map.  Hellbourne's Lookout Bubbles makes his report over voice chat, followed by the heavy silence of acceptance. ""Predator, held fast by his retainer Empath, has a Doombringer.""  The hellbourne defenders braced for the end, determined to stand as long as they could before their Barracks fell under the immense weight of the Legions's farm.


Without warning, an opportunity for victory presented itself, and Vindcator embraced it.  Predator was push-staffed into the Hellbourne base, followed by a Global silence that allowed the Hellbourne team to train down the Legion's mammoth carry before his team could react.  The Doombringer hit the ground with a thud heard across the map, and when the dust cleared, Brown Player arose victorius, holding the great blade like Isildur held the One Ring.


**Let us pause for a moment, and contemplate the deep philosophical implications of this turn of events.  Brown Player, who could not spell ""farm"", had acquired a Doombringer.**


Hope returned immediately to the heroes of Hellbourne.  They planned feverishly to pass the Doombringer to Vindicator.  While his farm was not great, he was the best hope Hellbourne had.  Vindicator was no stranger to Doombringer pooling, and was comfortable with the item.  He almost exclusively plays low HP ranged carries.  He had trained for this day his entire life.  The team finally convinced Brown Player to Hellbourne ancients to pass the weapon, breathing new life into the near-beaten defenders.  Brown Player arrived first, determined to fulfill his destiny (or maybe it was just luck, there was no proof he comprehended the idea of doombringer at this point, understood its implications, or had any higher brain function whatsoever), only to see a half HP Legion Predator farming the Hellbourne ancients.  Hellbourne watched as Brown Player swung his mighty scythe, cutting through the enemy predator just in time to kill him before stun wore off.
As Brown Player started killing the ancients, suddenly Vindicator understood.  Much like Elrond watching Isildur turn away from Mount Doom, Vindicator realized an inflection point had occurred.  Brown player had finally comprehended the power of his inventory, and would keep the weapon til death did him part.


Hellbourne watched helplessly as Brown Player silently farmed, occasionally going to pick off enemy heroes.  Suddenly, an enemy Andromeda appeared on the minimap, well into Legion territory.  The pull of The One Doombringer was too strong for Brown Player, it corrupted him.  The feeble warnings of his teammates did not hold a candle to the allure of +250dmg to Brown Player's autoattacks - He felt invincible.  Brown player initiated on Andromeda, and the full weight of the Legion crashed into him.  The Doombringer, along with all hope for victory, was lost in a single instant.  A single ""fuk"" was the only thing that broke the sullen silence that had fallen over Hellbourne chat.  Empath grabbed the mighty weapon and disappeared into the fog of war.

TLDR: Custom maps are possible, and we're releasing the dedicated server files to do it in a few days if s2 has nothing against it, we still haven't heard otherwise, we're just trying to be reason able.

Here are some videos of custom maps in action 5v5 on live 3.0 servers from the last week or so

Hey how ya going.

My names stefan also known as Xewl in various games, you may or may not know me from games like HoN, and WoW, hell maybe you even trashtalked me a few times or insulted my horrendus KDR

Ever since the first time I played HoN, the game has intrigued me without a doubt undisputedly the cleanest engine of any game I had ever played, I had not played dota previously yet especially with the old trees/grass, the game SCREAMED “HD WARCRAFT 3”

Anyone can tell by looking at hon immediantly that this game was made for modding, custom game modes have proven to be more fun then normal hon by just about everyone, do you really think im bluffing? Look at warcraft 3, I NEVER EVER see a normal game, it’s ALWAYS a custom map or dota.

I bet this is the part we’re you think I’m going to say, oh look s2 promiced us a map editor, and we never got custom maps, those bastards, well technically, they didn’t lie

theirs a map editor in HoN RIGHT now, fully functional and working and anyone can use it right now, simply go to your hon folder, find the editor.bat click it and you’re ready to go, anything you make can be played right at home on your own computer in practice mode.

We got what we were promiced, s2 technically never said that we could play custom maps..

level with me for a minute, just how exactly would it even work?

the way hon works, right now, s2 has brought servers in multiple countries across the globe, players are able to connect and use these servers to host their own games, this is incredible making hon a fair, stable experience with no hacking or cheating.

The maps are located on their server, just how exactly would you play your maps? Have them upload to the server EVERYTIME you want to host? 

it isn’t practical, and the main reason it hasn’t being possible up until this point, for that, s2 games, i can forgive you.

What I can’t forgive is how ignorant you have become.

Back in the beta daays, remember that local game button the one that was greyed out?

yeah that button may not have worked, but the beta client was FULLY CAPABLE of hosting your own games, including maps! 

Because of this, spin offs such as UB HON, LAN HON, have come up, using to this day still the OLD Beta client, and porting all the new heroes that have came, that is how desperate people are to play lan games.

An incredible modder made a mod called dota2hon, and guess what he had to do, to make it real, he had to make an ENTIRE CLIENT just for ONE MAP, that’s INSANITY. ARE YOU SERIOUS s2 games?

Look at what you’ve brang us to.

You had it disabled originaly for piracy reasons, so why in the hell jesus christ are you still not allowing people to host their own servers?

you know what’s funny, you release a practice mode, a mode to play offline and test almost everything, and it feels strangly familier to a public game… why can’t anyone connect? Why did you release this mode but not a localhost?

You know it’s kinda funny, and it intrigued one coder who took a look to find that the code was there all along, the functions in the dll files were simply all arranged to allow it for solo play only, so you give us the dedicated server but you lock us out of it for solo play? Really? Are you serious?

As of right now, custom servers, and maps, are possible on HoN 3.0 with modified DLLS.

The best part is only the person hosting them, needs to have them.

I can host, and anyone from international, garena, or axeos hon or whatever its called can all join without having a single modified file, RIGHT this very moment and play, obviously if ist a custom map they’ll need it but if I host caldavar they can conenct right now naked.

it’s absolutely incredible, there is a huge channel on hon RIGHT now playing custom servers, testing out the dlls and having so much fun it’s not funny, we only really have one good map right now but its managed to attract almost 300 players.

We have given the DLLs out to selected people, indivudualy, but it has not being publicly released yet, you know why?

Because we want to hear what s2 has to say, and more importantly you guys. :)

I have talked to many, many people from s2, all with the same old story that they have no say.

Let’s be honest here, We can release this now, RIGHT now, and not care, everyone will be happy, but we wanna hear what everyone has to say first because we’re not here to rebel against you.

It has been several months since the compression of rating and there are still only a handful of players at the 1900 rating. If anything, gaining rating has become a detriment to talented players - resulting in ridiculously long solo queues.

Stipulations and rewards would be an easy way to breathe life back into the community. This is something that Blizzard has always done very, very well. WC3 rewarded special portraits, WoW gave unique titles and mounts, and SC2 has achievements and portraits too. Why not HoN as well?

This is a small change that has the potential for tremendous effect. A unique name color/taunt or even just coins would address HoN's fatal flaws adequately - supplying both  a reason to play the game and supplementing the competitive community.

Let's be honest. S2 should scrap what they've got and start again from the beginning. 

1. Some of the heroes need to be larger. Pebbles should be about the size of twenty Pebbles. Anybody who has seen The Neverending Story can attest to this fact of life. 

2. While we're talking about it, he needs a motorcycle. End of discussion.

3. Dr. Repulsor's magnetic mine should have the non-zero chance of destroying the whole universe. I don't think it should format your hard drive, but it should at least kill both teams .01% of the time. Why would this not be awesome?

4. I once saw a praying mantis eat a fucking mouse. No joke. Why isn't one of these in the game?

5. Let's talk about Forsaken Archer. 

6. I would like more items that have a risk / reward aspect. Like psychedelic mushrooms. You eat them and everything gets all weird, but you don't care because you're so happy. Maybe you get a movement boost or something, but you have no idea who anybody is. 

7. If Pebbles is going to take up half the screen, we need a big lady too, so they can date. Also: the boobs in this game are only proportionally big. We need actual huge boobs. Maybe just a character who is a boob. Milk squirt, smother, Freudian Slip. These are its (her?) attacks. The ultimate is two boobs.

I'm DJ Hirko, the new Lead Programmer of Heroes of Newerth. I've been working at S2 since November of 2010 as a Senior Programmer and have been making games professionally for over 5 years. I've been playing HoN since August of 2009, currently sit around 1700 MMR, and have played over 2300 games of HoN. I've read and posted to the HoN subreddit for about a year now. I'd like to answer questions that you guys have on myself, HoN, and S2 Games, so Ask Me Almost Anything.

Proof: http://imgur.com/a5wNn

Edit (6:20 PM): Leaks! I hear you people like things being leaked, so I'll leak part of the patch notes tomorrow:

&gt; When you buy a recipe item via right-clicking on it or the ""purchase remaining components"" button, it will now intelligently combine as it's being purchased

&gt; * Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers. You right click on Ghost Marchers and now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and now have 2 Punchdagger in your stash

&gt; When you buy a recipe item via right-clicking on it or the ""purchase remaining components"" button, it will now look for recipe combinations in both your inventory and stash (if you have access to it)

&gt; * Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers with one Punchdagger in your stash. You right click on Ghost Marchers and now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and 2 Punchdaggers in your stash

&gt; When a courier delivers items, it now intelligently combines them as they're being delivered

&gt; * Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers. The courier delivers you 2 Punchdaggers and you now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and the courier would still have the 2 Punchdaggers

&gt; When you buy a Frostwolf Skull or Geometer's Bane via right-clicking on it or the ""purchase remaining components"" button and have a Frostburn, it won't buy the Icebrand/Firebrand anymore

&gt; * This was done because Frostburn can be disassembled and the Icebrand/Firebrand modifiers do not stack

&gt; When a recipe item combines, it inherits the oldest purchase time of its components, so that you can still sell it for full value after combining. As with other items, the ""recently purchased"" flag goes away if the owner dies or if the item is used

Edit (7:00 PM): I posted this in a reply, but I figured I'd share it a bit wider. When I originally applied to S2, it was when the programming staff was transitioning from California to Michigan. I sent my application in to Jason Morales, who I found out later had left the company to stay in California, and didn't hear back. I had given up hope, but then a random meeting happened: http://i.imgur.com/VEgbx.jpg

Edit (7:25 PM): Another leak!
&gt;- Increased the max players per channel from 200 to 250

Edit (8:45 PM): An example of some of the awesome stuff our community does: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJW3KxbxCDE&amp;feature=plcp

Edit (10:05 PM): Time for me to head out and play some HoN with people that PM'd me. I'll still be responding over the next few hours/days, but it'll be much slower. I leave you guys with what is probably one of my favorite songs: Metallica's cover of Astronomy - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgqDtU8BXf0

Thank you very much for reading and posting. I'm glad I was able to answer your questions and give some insight into working at S2. I hope you guys enjoy HoN as much as we love working on it!

The players in question are NH, MQ, and Empath ( they made it clear they were a 3made).  I am the pink magmus.

To start it off, I will give you the match ID: 76058923

The game started out suspiciously as I notice the Brown NH in my game was a 1470 or so, however, he had a kd of almost 4.0 with 600 games played. Suspicious? I think so.

So the game is around 15 mins in and we are winning handily (16-1 or so) and my team tries to CC.  Earlier I had commented on how brown was such low MMR but he has a messed up kdr.  With this first cc, they say ""now do you see how my kdr is so high"".  Here is where it just starts getting interesting.  

Since I won't cc and attribute to brown smurfing down to 1300 and continuing to ruin games they tell me that I will be kicked by them eventually whether I like it or not.  At this point they talk about how they plan to feed a Doom just to make sure we don't accidently still win.  They even start whispering Orange on the other team to make sure they don't concede before NH feeds them a Doombringer.

So I have a few timestamps that relate to the obvious abused I experienced.  At 22:45(give or take a few secs) NH feeds his first Doombringer at second tower on the legion side.  Also, at 25:40 NH talks about how he almost has his second DB rdy to give away(one of the first times they type as they told me I can't do anything because they aren't leaving a ""paper trail"".

The thing that really makes this abuse annoying was that the 3made proceeded to whisper the other team and tell them to kick me. He said they if they agreed to kick me they would win so that NH could continue to drop MMR but farm his kdr.  The funniest part was at the end when they said they do this all the time and no one can stop them; anyone who disagrees with what they do gets kicked and once ur kicked U CANT REPORT!!

I hope you take the time to DL this replay and I can only hope a GM or two can ban these three and stop them from ruining hundreds of other games. Thank you",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,,True,t3_og26r,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/og26r/the_worst_abuse_ive_ever_seen_in_hon/,

My 1500 clan were tired after a 1 hour drive and 30min train to the CBD of sydney. 

The venue was cityhunter lan cafe. A lan cafe like no other, where asians were sleeping on chairs after 12 hours of non stop LoL gaming. It was the nerdiest atmosphere i had ever seen

Our first game was vs a 1750 clan. We knew we had no chance - yet we rose up to the challenge. I captained my comrades, drafted the right team, and through blood sweat tears, we sealed a 56minute victory after a smooth genocide (which we earned 500 gold coins each for). 

The best part?? Little did i know that the fabled DABELIUTEEF and SLICKZ were standing right behind me, watching me play the wretchedest of hags. After the genocide we all jumped out of our seats in happiness and excitement. We had sealed our first victory. I turned around out of my seat, and came face to face with the master carry. The king. The fabled slickz. He looked at me gently, and whispered ""nice synergy, man"". 

My heart melted

As you guys might have heard, Complexity Gaming is closing it's HON division. I would just like to personally thank them for such an enjoyable year-long sponsorship with them that has allowed me to experience many things a gamer could only dream of.

First of all they were really professional about approaching us, talked to us with respect like how you would talk to your co-worker at the office. They gave us awesome contracts which paid for every cost at LAN, and didn't take any % of the prizepool from us. On top of that it even had a neat little salary.

Complexity Gaming also gave me the chance to move to Texas for several months to live in their HUGE gaming house there for free. On top of that, they even flew me out of some business trip to California (all expenses paid of course) to test-play the game FIREFALL. I met youtube stars like SeaNanners and prominent SC2 people like DJWheat and the owner of EG.

Everytime I needed advice, or needed help, Andrew Meisner/Scott Ford/Jason Bass would gladly lend a helping hand and expect nothing in return. They were resourceful, friendly, approachable, professional, and extremely easy to work with and talk to.

Thank you Complexity, without you guys, I would never be the person I am today.

On that note, since my contract is finished with Complexity, I would like to annouce that I'm joining Slickz's team under the clan name ""Too Much Sugar"".

I would like to add there was no drama leaving my old team. I always wanted to play with Slickz and try out something new and have fun with it! I was also sick of playing suicide, I will primarily be playing the carry role in my new team.

Sorry to disappoint all the coL fans to see me leaving. I've been teammates with bkid for more than 1 and a half year and it pains my heart to leave him like that, I don't deny (or confirm hehe) that I didn't try to get bkid and riser to join my team, I just wanted to extend a hand to my ex-teammates who love and play this game with a passion and actually enjoy playing the game together with me.

To Peter, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, one day even Jesus of Nazareth stood up and left on an adventure, I too, want to spread my wings and fry away. Till then, see you next LAN where we'll be friends again.

A 1600 redditor asked for some advice on how to get out of the 1600s, so i decided to take one of his games and go over the big mistakes that were made by him, and the other 9 1600 players in the game.

1500s and 1700s are probably making these mistakes alot too, i feel unqualified to tell 1700s what to do however, as thats where I currently hover.
Will make more if people find these helpful or entertaining.

The fact that we have to pay GOLD COINS (so basically, real money) for content which some may access before us, and is therefore paying for GAMEPLAY advantages (previously the store was only for cosmetic purchases) is a joke.

If people who purchased HON prior to today had instant access to the new heroes, i'd be a little bit less annoyed, but this Early Access 250gold coins is an absolute joke and S2 just lost all respect i had for them. I was always an S2 supporter and was fine with the time it took for them to deter the DDoS attacks, but this is just an absolute joke.

Any game that gives gameplay advantages for real money is bad.

It has come to my attention that a lot of you think a courier does not need to be purchased at level one. Whether this lack of a courier may be due to a lack of support on your team or just general apathy does not really make a difference. I wish to make my opinion on the subject abundantly clear:

**If you don't get a courier at level one, you will lose the game.**

How does not having a courier guarantee you to lose the game? Well, technically it doesn't, but practically it does. The thing about not having a courier is that if you don't get a courier, the problems start as early as your mid failing hard.

""But Mr. Nigma, a *good* mid can win even without a courier!""

No he can't. Not if he's up against an enemy of the same skill level. 

""But why? What's the big deal?""

If your mid does not have a courier, he does not have a bottle. If he does not have a bottle, he cannot bottle runes. If he cannot bottle runes, he cannot refill his bottle. If he cannot refill his bottle, his enemy will refill his bottle every time. If his enemy refills his bottle every time, his enemy has unlimited health and mana- and I think you can agree that having unlimited health and mana to be a *significant advantage*.

""If Middle wants a courier that badly, he should just buy it himself. Also, why doesn't he just get a bottle at level 1? Problem solved.""

**No.** Please stop using this logic. Unlike the other lanes, a the solo player middle needs all +damage and stats he can muster at early levels else he cant compete with last hitting. It's completely unviable to go bottle at level 1. Nobody should ever have to do this. 

**If your team has no courier and no wards at level one, and your enemy does, you will lose middle lane against same skilled players that do. Guaranteed.**

""But our team really doesn't have any Support and I really don't want to buy a courier""

Too bad. Bite the bullet. If you aren't soloing, and nobody bought a courier, you have to buy a courier. Yes, it's going to suck not having those +stats items or that buckler you should have, and yes, it's probably your team's fault, and yes, they probably screwed you over by picking those four melee heroes that you didn't need- but let's face it: buying that courier is going to significantly increase your chance of winning. So just **do it**.

PS: And if nobody bought wards: Buy one. You don't even need to buy two. One Ward provides your mid with the knowledge of 3 tablet spawns for the first 6 minutes of the game. ",,False,self,t5_2r497,False,,scout,True,t3_jctyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/jctyn/psa_couriers/,

I have played a few games with and against this bug now and let's be honest it's totally unfair to the enemy team. 

Of course you can tell he casted it when you hear the sound, but if you weren't there early fight or even if you did know it's up what are you expected to do ? manually check the time to know when it'll be over? I mean c'mon.

And for those of you not agreeing that it needs to be fixed ASAP, I'm sorry but I've seen to many players tower dive a defiler with it's ult up and die near instantly because they didn't know. Or even worse succubus using her ulti on defile alone in lane with her expecting to get a nice kill but defiler's ult still had 5 seconds up. Before she realises it she's dead.

The thread was ***instantly*** deleted from the forums. It wasn't even a normal delete, it was hard deleted by them, meaning it cannot be restored and could have only been removed by someone with explicit admin privileges.


-----



Today, we say farewell and give our thanks to the six volunteers who have done an awesome job of supporting HoN, but have ultimately decided to take their leave.
 
Global Moderator and Game Master ElementUser (Special shoutout for the thousands of bugs you have fixed, and the hundreds of optimizations so that the servers aren't too stressed out)
 
Moderator Okuu
 
Senior Game Master Aya
 
Game Master Crysiz (The entire GM team thanks you for those dota2 keys [*though it is IMO still inferior to HoN*])
 
Game Master Coolcollo
 
Game Master Cptyuyusama
 
While everyone has their own reasons, the main points have been made clear in unison.
 
The constant inappropriate S2 rage-bans from in game that fell upon GM and moderator reputation and workload.
 
Dis-respectfulness towards volunteers from employees on several different occasion. Volunteers are indeed replaceable, but dedicating their time, for free and for the sake of the community is NOT a privilege.
 
Unless S2 puts a serious amount of investment and effort in remedying these short-sighted flaws, HoN will not succeed in the goal of being a reputable game that is fun and balanced to play, but instead its sole use will be for monetary gain - not for people's enjoyment. It is understandable for a company to be profit oriented, but not to the extreme.
 
The amount of hypocrisy and double-standards displayed by S2 policies, words and actions, along with intentional ignorance towards presented issues. Lying to your volunteers is probably a bad idea as well.
 
The seemingly diverging and diminishing lack of efforts towards HoN's future from a longer-term outlook.
 
But I digress, providing a slew of empty shells of reasons is not the point of the thread. With this recent update, the reign of the first volunteer group has officially ended (at least those that hasn't been hired, thus a short shout out is due.) Special thanks to
 
Sucker - Though I did not know you that well, thanks for all the work you put into the forums at the beginning of HoN.
 
Anghkor - I'll always remember ricing SBT apps with you
 
Sadfish - For always being sad
 
Nigma - For his wonderful schlong (and comely too)
 
Warchamp7 - For leading Team Warchamp and droppin G's on DivA
 
To conclude, this did not happen out of vengeance or spite. There is no hard feelings from any of us towards S2. However, I advise the staff to treat this as a wake-up call, for while the numbers are low, every volunteer that has heard about this has cheered us on, but ultimately decided to remain for a little longer not for the sake of S2, but for the sake of a better community. So to conclude, thank you to everyone who has left today, and thank you to all the volunteers who continue on despite their feelings towards S2, and thank you to the any future volunteers that will carry on the spirit of selflessness.
 
To any S2 who is affected by this post, you may hate me if you wish, I don't mind.",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,wraith-revenant,True,t3_pe6gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/pe6gl/volunteer_farewell/,

- **The Professor**: ""I'm not going to concede because then you won't learn anything""
- **Commander Taggart**: ""Never give up. Never surrender.""
- **The DJ**: mic comes on, garbled shitty music plays... all game.
- **Deaf Jams**: ""I can't hear you. Listening to my music.""
- **Rihanna**: Feel like you're the only girl in the HoN world? You are. And every guy reminds you that computers don't belong in the kitchen.
- **Fat Man**: When Silver Bullet isn't enough, there's always Level 5 Codex
- **Doomsday Prophet**: Oh God, they got First Blood. It's all over now. CC at 15.
- **The Deflector**: ""Damn dude, you were awful."" ""Yeah, but seriously, look at this 0-8 Glacius. What a trash bandit nubling.""
- **The Brown Noser**: ""[All] Every game, my team is trash. Blue, you were really good though. Give me your sympathies. Validate my life.""
- **Exlax**: I have to take a 12 Couric poop, but I'll start this game first.
- **Survivorman**: Deep in enemy territory. Alone. No TPs. No chance of survival.
- **The Shameless Self Promoter**: 1400 game, but still spamming ""Check out my twitch.tv stream! twitch.tv/SirNoobington""
- **Edgar Allen Poe**: Taunted by KingRaven, rage quits life.
- **There is a ME in Team**: Always half-way across the map when you need them most.
- **Mr. Magoo**: Apparently has no minimap and is oblivious to everything. Then gets pist when he dies, even though you told him about his impeding death.
- **The Big Mac**: ""I'll take that kill to go."" *Nighthound swoops in for a last hit, then retreats into stealth during a team fight*
- **Automatan 3000**: Auto-attacks throughout the laning phase. Never responds to you as a lane mate.
- **The Swimmer**: GG. Sitting in the pool spamming wards until we can CC.
- **Good Guy Glacius**: Wards all game. Maxes aura early on. Stacks and pulls. Only denies creeps and harasses. Never takes a kill. Dies numerous times so that the carry may live.
- **The Toyota**: We have a runaway Rampage who won't stop charging even though the target has retreated into tower range with 4 allies nearby.
- **The Smurf**: Aww, look at this cute little blue guy...
- **The Little Brother**: ""Sorry I'm playing so bad... I suck, this is actually my brother's account."" Sure Buddy...
- **The Human Scale**: ""Valk's arrow is so imba!"" ""Maybe you should stop running into it and standing still...."" If it killed me, it must be imbalanced.
- **The Economist**: Rages about how S2 is $2 and needs to stop charging for everything. Obviously, games with no business model are very successful.
- **The Gardener**: ""BRB, farming jungle for 30 minutes."" Tends to his crops, stacks them, gets into his zone and at peace. Meanwhile, the team is 0-22.
- **The Tattle-Tell**: Piss him off and he tells everyone your positions.
- **Techies**: If only Engineer had a suicide...
- **The Charter Subscriber**: With a ping of 1,000 ms, there's only one explanation. Charter Internet.
- **The Casual Gamer**: ""Sorry, it's hard to target with a tracking pad""
- **Syndrome**: Did he just make a sentance entirely out of f-bombs? Or does he just have tourettes?

Project Epoch is a clan in Heroes of Newerth created right after LN disbanded. This clan's only purpose is to serve as a way to help trainees under 1700 get better by having mentors volunteering to mentor the students that come to this clan seeking for help. Mentors are rewarded by gold coins as a little incentive and motivation to keep mentoring these trainees. 
***
Hello Redditors, some of you may know me as DivineWithin, or eC`cHi. I have been a member of Epoch Project ever since this clan was made, and have been in the LNCIP (Ludus Novicius Community Involvement Project), mentoring over 200 students and refining my ways of teaching players how to get better (for free!). I have been a dedicated mentor and have provided a loyal service to my trainees and administrators of the like for a very long time, mentoring hundreds of hours way before the coin system was introduced to this community, way before this community even reached 50 members.
 
Working alongside Yukari and the rest of the Epoch community, I have made great friends and established strong connections with the trainees I mentor, as well as other mentors, officers of the like. I have seen people come and go very fast, and I have seen people who have stayed with me for this long. But not this time, E.
 

My Story:
 

I had exams for the entire month of April, so I have not been able to be active mentoring people on Epoch for that duration. During this time, whatever free time I had was put into mentoring my current trainees as a way of taking a break, and then it was back to studying. After finals were done, I came on the forums and was introduced to Portal, a system created and used by mentors so admins can check minutes mentored and credit mentors for their work. I will keep from posting information related to how Portal works for the sake of privacy.
 

My style of teaching differs greatly from other mentors. I like to go beyond the scope of merely spectating a game and give scattered (although some would claim detailed) instruction whilst my trainee struggles with last hits and denies. I feel that they cannot get the most out of our time, so I supplement these sessions with game reviews, 1v1 private sessions, and skype calls after the match. For trainees that ask for it, I also mentor their future matches and try to work with them to identify their areas of weakness. I put a lot of work into helping my student improve their level of play and **all**, with no exceptions, have shown honest appreciation for my efforts.
 

During my stay in Epoch, I found that students need time to process and digest the information we try to provide for them. For even the simplest concepts, trainees may need to ask questions that require attention outside the game they just played. This is where I try to go the extra mile and offer my spare time on Skype to go over and review a game, sometimes for hours, without playing with them. This is my style of teaching. I talk to them for hours on end via Skype without them playing, and they sit and listen. Whatever questions they have, they are free to ask me without being under pressure, i.e. in a game. When I review concepts and mechanics to a trainee, I talk for over 2 hours at a time, sometimes making my throat hurt just because I truly want them to get better and enjoy playing HoN more. However, when a big misunderstanding like this that leads me into being exempted from Project Epoch without notice, it hurts, it really does.
 

When I explained this to RyanWenke (new GM hired by S2 in charge of publicity matters for Epoch, also the manager of Portal), this gentleman accused me of ""cutting corners"", or as a way of spending more time with students in order to try and get more minutes recorded down, getting more coins as a result of it. I tried to explain my situation with him and before I even got to 30% of my explanation, he laughed in my face and told me that talking on Skype with your trainees can already be done via chat mentoring function in game, and splitting up the times to talk on Skype would just cut corners for you to get more coins. I hope this is merely an understanding on his part, as he did not give me a chance to explain myself. I tried reaching out to him on Skype but it seems like he has no interest in contacting me. I find these allegations to be quite frankly insulting, and anyone who knows me will know this to be untrue. I've been volunteering my time, for free, as a member of LN for the last 2 months until they have disbanded. I've been in Project Epoch since the inception of the clan; and I'm in no way movitated by e-currency to help others.
 

After he discussed this with Visions, I have not heard of any of them since (Visions has not even bothered to PM me, requesting my side of the story). I was:
 
• Removed from Project Epoch silently without notice

• My orange name that I have worked hard for was removed

• Removed from the Epoch Chat Channel

• Demoted to a regular member on the forums
 

With all due respect Reddit, I thank you all for reading my concern. It was a very fun experience working with Project Epoch until ElementUser and Yukari left. People who do these things simply leave no feelings for the people that do the hard work, and everything done is done internally, without letting the public know about it. I am here to shed you some light on this, and how the mentors are really treated when something does not go their intended way.
 

To this day, I have been constantly taking in new students to mentor, and every single one of my students have gave feedback that my teaching style has been a tremendous help for them and it has benefited their game play by far. A lot of my trainees frequently offered to pay me back, some even gifted me gold coins without my consent because they know I will always decline it. I will still continue to mentor my current trainees who are on my Skype list, because I am loyal to them. Just because I have been booted from a non-profit community does not mean I am not able to teach.
 

My mentoring thread can be found [here](http://projectepoch.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49)

This thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/irl2r/introducing_the_epoch_project_a_community/) is where it all started
***
**tl;dr:** Epoch silently kicked one of the first and oldest staying mentors from their community, and this is here because the post I make on the Epoch forums will be deleted and removed once the administrators find it.
***
**Edit:** For anyone curious, whether or not I get invited back to Epoch is entirely up to them. If they decide to invite me back in, this will hurt their reputation, and seeing that mentors are a renewable source, I highly doubt this possibility anyways. I will be continuing to mentor anyone that asks for help still, with the same amount of effort put into this as I have put throughout my days in Epoch. The only difference now is that it will be more of a challenge finding players who are willing to accept me as their mentor.",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,phoenix-ra,True,t3_tlpup,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/tlpup/how_i_was_privately_removed_from_the_epoch/,

We are all in the high 1600s, except for one  who is 1790. Our random on our team was a brown player by the name of tommy9k7. He picked pebbles and  went mid.

He then proceeded to demolish mid, as well as the rest of the opposing team. We requeued with him several times after this. He went mid every time as brown, and every time he completely destroyed the oppostion.... and he never said a single word.

He carried our team each and every time. Never spoke a word. Never said anything over chat. Just silently won the game for us over and over. Never asked for wards, never said anything.

Then after the 5th game or so of him going immortal, he was done. And then he spoke for the first, and last time. He said:

&gt;Thanks.

And with that he disappeared into the shadows of newerth, never to be seen again.

No, tommy9k7, thank *you.*",,False,self,t5_2r497,1354345305.0,,the-madman,True,t3_1437mv,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/1437mv/a_tribute_to_our_silent_champion_tommy9k7/,

these shirts are quite 'old' for me now, since it's been a while that I've made them. Finally I've got some time on my hands and decided to upload them - yay!

http://imgur.com/a/GgUVv

Any feedback is welcome! I planned to do some more, but did not get around to it yet. I still have many ideas floating around in the back of my head.

Personally, I love the gg-cc-15 and the pubtrain shirt. While the codex5 shirt was the most work, I feel the print is too small - so I blew it up on the preview. If I decide to print it again (maybe for one of you guys?) I would print it bigger.

Anyway, would appreciate any and all feedback! 

---

*UPDATE* Holy crap, thanks for all the feedback folks! I will definitely find a way to make them available. Unfortunately I am currently in Egypt and have lousy Interwebz - but I'll be back home in a week and update you guys asap. Thanks again, you guys are awesome!

    HoN 3.1 - The Runic Shift
    -------------
    == General ==

    - The Early Access Program has been suspended indefinitely
    + These changes were made in an effort to make one of our most important pieces of content, Heroes, become more creative, engaging, and exciting. While there is no longer a definitive schedule you can still expect to see new (and better!) Heroes added to the game. Also be on the lookout for more reworks due to this change in direction.
    - Heroes will no longer be mandatorily created and released every 4 weeks
    * Heroes are available to everyone immediately upon release

    - Added new Hero: Sir Benzington
    * Nimble and deadly, Benzington is a highly mobile melee ganking Hero that also gains increased attack range. Knightfall and Joust allows for engagements at incredible distances making Benzington an intimidating force anytime an enemy is spotted.
    * Joust - Target a direction to dash forward up to 900 units, passing through the first enemy Hero hit and stopping. Enemies hit receive 100/170/240/310 Magic Damage and a 0.7 second stun.
    * Royal Stomp - Activate to pull all nearby enemies 200/250/300/350 units towards you and reduce enemy Movement Speed by 40% for 2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.
    * Lance-A-Long - Passively increases your Attack Range by 50/100/150/200. Activate to boost your next attack to 428 range and add up to 100/180/260/340 Magic Damage. Your attacks passively build up to 5 charges, increasing the damage when you activate it.
    * Knightfall - Target an enemy at considerable range to leap into the air and become invulnerable for 3 seconds. When you land, you deal 200/350/500 Magic Damage and apply a 50% tapering slow for 2 seconds in a 400/500/600 radius.
    * This Hero will be released with 2 avatars. One is a Premium Alt Avatar and the other is introducing a new type of avatar called the Debut Edition (in lieu of the previous exclusive EA Alt Avatar). Debut Edition Alt Avatars are sold for a limited period of time after the release of a hero. They are not exclusively limited to that period of time and may reappear within the store at a later time.
    * Releases 5/3/2013


    - HoN Development Direction Shift
    * Recently here at S2 Games we have gone through an internal direction shift in how we look at Heroes of Newerth. We believe that giving back to the community is the best way to serve HoN. We are looking to take more risks with our game through the support of the community; a testament to this is the fact that most of the changes in this patch have originated or been inspired by community input. This patch is designed to re-invigorate the game with some much-needed changes that promote the fast paced, action packed gameplay of Heroes of Newerth. Look forward to the continued improvement of Heroes of Newerth with the best possible service we can provide!


    - Added a new Rune: Rune of Refreshment
    + The purpose of this rune is to create more contention between the rune locations while creating more action and movement from Heroes.
    * Spawns at the opposite location and at the same time as the normal Rune spawn
    * When picked up, this Rune will restore 135 Health and 70 Mana over 3 seconds. Dispels on damage.
    * If bottled, refills the Bottle to 2/3 full
    * Will not appear unless a normal Rune would as well


    - New Ingame Radial Menu
    + In looking for ways to increase communication between players on a team, we found this menu will greatly improve the ability to easily and quickly communicate during intense action
    * Accessed by holding ALT and then holding left click on a spot on screen, as if you were to ping it but holding down both buttons
    * Easily and very quickly lets a player communicate with the rest of the team
    * Players can ping map locations, signal other players to retreat, say they think there is danger, call missing, tell people they are coming to assist, and more!
    * You can now mute/ignore allies by right-clicking on their portrait
    * Muting/Ignoring a player will now hide all pings that player sends


    - Hero Kill Changes
    + Hero kills become much more valuable throughout most stages of the game. Level 1 Hero kills remain mostly the same but after level 1, experience granted for early kills is greatly increased. Late game Hero kills give about a 33% increase in gold. Players will now be encouraged to get killing sprees rather than discouraged. Teams are now more incentivized to kill static farming Heroes instead of avoiding them.
    * Increased the gold given per level of a Hero from 5 to 10
    * Decreased the amount of gold given for kill streaks from 50 to 25
    * Decreased the gold loss for dying from 30 to 25 per level
    * Heroes will now be worth more gold depending on their GPM compared to the average GPM of the game. A Hero can be worth up to 50% more. Kill streak and first blood are not affected.
    * Changed experience granted on kills from 100-2300 to 100-2500 (Area experience when multiple Heroes are around remains unchanged)
    * A streak will now reduce the gold lost of the streaker by 25 per streak on his next death
    * Solo Hero kills will now grant the absence of assist gold to the team (split four ways)


    - Lane Dynamic
    + Lane pulling used to be mandatory. These changes will still allow a team to gain an advantage from pulling neutral creeps but it will no longer become mandatory in order to compete against another team if they are pulling. This change does not affect player controlled Neutrals.
    * Melee Lane Creeps increased damage they do to Neutrals from 125% to 150%
    * Ranged Lane Creeps increased damage they do to Neutrals from 75% to 150%
    * Uncontrolled Neutral creeps damage reduced to Lane Creeps by roughly 50%
    * Lane Creeps will no longer be able to be pulled to multiple Neutral camps
    * When a player takes control of a Lane or Neutral creep, the damage they do to each other is reverted to the normal values


    - Ancients
    + Making Ancients somewhat harder to kill will increase the length of time when a team or player can effectively do them. Going this route instead of reducing their reward still allows ancients to be an effective boost in terms of gold and experience. The Predasaurs getting more Movement Speed also helps to make them more of a threat and not as easily kited.
    * Predasaur Crusher: Movement Speed increased from 300 to 350
    * Predasaur Crusher: Armor increased from 4.12 to 8
    * Predasaur: Movement Speed increased from 270 to 350
    * Predasaur: Health increased from 675 to 800
    * Predasaur: Armor increased from 2.94 to 3.5
    * Dragon Master: Magic Armor increased from 10 to 12
    * Dragon: Magic Armor increased from 5.5 to 8


    - Bosses
    + Due to our past buffs to Kongor, we are no longer worried about the extra damage illusions bring to killing this boss. This also fixes the issue where picking up the Rune of Power in Mid Wars and the other boss instantly killing your illusions.
    * Kongor, Transmutanstein, and Zorgath will no longer instantly kill illusions that attack them


    - Abilities now show their Mana Costs on the Ability icon
    + After seeing the popularity of a UI modification and consistent frequency of requests for this feature, we have now made it a part of the standard UI. Thanks for your input and feedback!
    * This works for split and multi-abilities as well",,False,self,t5_2r497,1367600667.0,,s2games,True,t3_1dm2gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/1dm2gl/31_the_runic_shift_full_patch_notes/,

Let me give you a brief description of my gaming history:

**Diablo 2 LOD** - This game consumed my life in high school, as I played this game religiously.  I played on a closed USW server, however, I never played ladder.  

**Dota** - I played Dota for about 4 years but switched to Hon immediately after it was released in closed beta.  I never played on any high tier teams in dota, but did play in many of the high leagues such as IDEC.  I played on a horrible laptop with no hotkey script at all, making it very hard for me to play to my full potential.  Once HoN came out with it's own hotkeys integrated + my desktop, things got much easier...

**HoN** - Played since closed Beta - started under the name ""Singularity"".  My teams include uqt, SK, sGty, vRs, and now tdM.

**About HoN**: I was playing a game of Dota and suddenly Orie (YoDa) spammed in /f l that ""guys, you are all playing the wrong game. You need to play Hon"".  I tried it out and like many other Dota players, I could not go back to Dota.  Hon was simply a much, MUCH better game.  Faster/clearer animations, smoother gameplay, heroes that don't look like minecraft characters..etc.  I absolutely love this game.  It is extremely well made, but unfortunately a lack of balance is starting to take a toll on its credibility within the competitive community.  You know it, and I know it, you cannot play solo matchmaking (or even team matchmaking) with mode ""AP"" on.  Why not? Who here HASN'T played against the two that have 99% gemini/monarch on their played list? 'Nuff said on that. 

**AMA!** - When I'm streaming, sometimes I really don't have time to answer all of your questions, and for that I apologize.  However, you can ask me them here and I will respond with Haste!  Some FAQ to jumpstart you:

**Q: Did you stop streaming?**

**A**: No, sometimes I like to just play while I'm not streaming! From time to time, when you stream, you feel like you constantly have to play game after game with no downtime, or else you will lose viewers.  So it's nice to just take a break from streaming and idle in HoN and chat or spectate other games.


**Q: Who's the best team?**

**A**: ex-Lions.  Even with them losing 0-2 to fpbs recently in scrims, they are the best team at the moment.  They have extremely talented players, but more than that they understand the game as a team very well.  They understand game mechanics and what works and what doesn't.  They do however, have a tendency to draft for early-mid game dominance which usually works out for them, but it's a bit risky in my opinion because if you get shut down early on or if the game is stagnant with a harder carry on the other team, then they're in trouble.


**Q: Yeah but do you think they have enough LAN experience to beat MSI at a LAN? They lost to them at Dreamhack...**

**A**: LAN experience is hyped and doesn't mean jack shit. I'm sorry, but it just doesn't and if you think otherwise, you've either never been to a LAN tournament or you're an idiot.  I've never met anyone who plays dramatically worse or even a bit worse on LANS (except for nervesMeander game 1 at NASL :D) than they do in their own home. It simply doesn't make any bit of sense. You bring your mouse and keyboard for a reason - you don't have to adjust to anything.  I'm super OCD about my setup but it still doesn't phase me when I have to play on a different computer.  That being said, I really don't know how Lions lost to MSI, but things happen.  Misdrafting happens from time to time - I didn't actually watch their games, but I talked with them and they apparently did not recognize the power of zephyr. 


**Q: Why do you always blow into your hand?**

**A**: My hands get dry and I don't like the feeling of my hand slipping off my mouse, so I do it to create moisture :D


That's about is - Ask me whatever you like.  Also follow my stream, which is now up on HoNTV@ *www.twitch.tv/Tralf*. I also have a new fanpage on Facebook, so follow me there @ *http://www.facebook.com/tdM.Tralfamadore*

I wana be 100% honest, when we walked into this new year things looked bleak. I was wondering if there was anything s2 could do to turn around this weak streak. Thankfully you've proven me, and several other people wrong.

Just a list of things you've done to help improve and better everything in the game, your fourms and this subreddit.

* Midwars
* Listening to the community about skins and even the rate you release heroes
* The community balance patch
* Two Year Anniversary Celebration (Especially the local tournaments in AZ, and CA)
* The 100 Hero Celebration
* The Game HoN Event that's going on ATM
* Lock pick mode
* DreamHoN at Dream Hack Summer
* S2 Plays on Fridays
* The random awesome Wallpapers

So I am sure by the giant post Nigma made you could have figured out I wanted to do a sneak peek spoiler tonight for the patch tomorrow. It's actually a huge patch and we are all super excited for it, so I am going to give you some visual tidbits and you can try to figure out what they mean.

Each picture correlates to a section/line of the patch notes. Some of them will be very easy (as in obvious). Some of them will be damn hard to figure out. I will update this OP and also make a comment with the picture so you can use that to work together and try to figure it out.

I should update one every hour for a while until I sleep, if I do! If you don't get it after a while I will fill you in what it is. =]

So here we go. I will start with something not quite easy, since this is a part of the notes that is different from what it normally would be!

It was too hard, I was poop, I still am poop but I'm better now.  After starting to play HoN, coming from league, I questioned why HoN isn't as popular if not more popular.  For times sake I'll try to keep it short. (comparing HoN to LoL)
1) to me HoN has a much better play style, mana cost are higher but everything does more damage, which makes timing and planning more crucial
2) There seems to be more build potential depending on who you are facing/how well you are doing/ect
3) Heroes seem more unique compared to lol
4) the skins are far superior on hon
5) custom announcers bring a whole new life to the game
6) there is much more teamwork potential
7) there are so many unique items with actives 
8) theres no one correct way to play the meta

To close, personally I think in time HoN might become the most popular moba. I can only compare it to league, but I believe it is less popular currently because it is more challenging than league

1329316680.0,91,self.HeroesofNewerth,pqps7,I'm about to start my Honours thesis in Data Mining. I was wondering if there's any interest in me Data Mining HoN?,109,18,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/pqps7/im_about_to_start_my_honours_thesis_in_data/,"Hey guys (and any S2 staff who see this)!

I'm currently in my 4th year of university, about to start my Honours thesis. I'm in the process of narrowing down the question I'll pursue for the next 9 months, and at the moment it's:

""Using Data Mining techniques to balance MOBA games.""

.

Basically, I was thinking I could apply Data Mining techniques to the Match Stats of maybe 10,000-100,000 games, and look for any correlations between hero composition, item choices, GPMs, MMR, etc.

For example, perhaps there are certain hero line-ups that have very high win rates? While stats exist for individual hero win rates, there's been no formal research done (to my knowledge at least) looking at full sets of 5 heroes, and the cohesion gained from different setups. Not to mention the potential impact of certain items on that line-up.

So I've got 2 questions:

1. Would people be interested in seeing the results of something like this?

2. Would the S2 staff be okay with me doing this? I wouldn't be creating any mods or anything - I'd simply read the stats of thousands of games. This wouldn't break the EULA, right?

1328304842.0,90,self.HeroesofNewerth,p9spq,"Because I hate you, here's some advice",142,52,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/p9spq/because_i_hate_you_heres_some_advice/,"Dear indefinite you:

* Stop raging. Nobody cares about you, you're not good and you're certainly not trolling and not funny at trying to troll or trying to play off your complete idiocy as trolling either. Look, I get it, I hate everyone I meet too. I mean, I haven't even met you, dear reader (whatever), but I already want to fistfuck your unborn thoughts because I hate them. But I don't usually tell people that, especially not if I'm relying on them to not rage out for the next 20-40 minutes. Shutting the fuck up boosts your winrate like crazy, so guess what.

* You don't need any carries at all for your average pub game, least of all any ""hard"" carries: Don't get me wrong, a single one is *okaaaaaay*, although often still a bit counterproductive. Several on the other hand is completely detrimental. There's a limited amount of gold to be made from killing creeps, and the more people do it the worse the payoff gets both individually and for the team. 

* It's never okay to not stack/block your own spawn with corpses: This is part of what makes the above so horrible, is badly farming or having to farm badly because there's a guy on your own team running around slow-killing every single spawn out there. Don't do this shit. Stack, and if you kill a single spawn leave the corpses outside the respawn. Holy shit. NEVER.

* Really, fuck it, again, get this carry bullshit and every guide you've ever read out of your head. Shit like Tort, Revenant, Bubbles, Artesia, Hag, Aluna and Pyro is crazy strong throughout the whole game. Just take it on good faith if someone confidently wants to go mid with a hero. Sidelaning with people you don't know sucks, but if you're not in the top 2 slots in the game that is probably your lot - jesus fuck, just stop raging already. You can still roam, after all.

* Hell, gonna reiterate this again so it's perfectly clear: Don't argue with people. Best, don't talk at all. Anything else is a fucking dead end. Those folks that are chill will continue to be chill even if you say nothing, those with dicks up their ass will just become petulant, obstinate little sluts hankering for a verbal dicking. Say nothing, not on voice or on text.

* Throw out the 'hard roles' notion too. If you're low in the MMR range of the game, you're kind of go to for support-jobs no matter what you pick. Picking bullshit doesn't exclude you from buying a ward or upgrading the courier. Your mid will probably do it if you don't, but you are paying for that much, much harder than spending 200/100g at any point. Later on, anyone can buy wards, but whoever builds early pace dominates the game pretty hard for a while - if they have to spend that momentum on upgrading or miss a rune regardless of dominance, you're going to feel it in your sidelanes. Trust me: MUCH MORE THAN YOU WOULD MISS THAT EARLY GOLD, FUCKO.

* Consumables are great (buy more if you run out), aggressive play is great, farming in a 2v2 lane is bad. The winner of a lane are the ones that kill the other dudes or force them out. Creeps determine when the other dumbass steps in and when it's a good time to harass or open. Pay attention to the wave as a whole and their heroes hitting it/stepping in and punish that shit like you're an abusive stepfather.

* The strongest laners are actually usually ""support"" heroes. And Ra is kind of a pussy. This goes hand in hand with aggressive play up above - pick for it, and realize that a lot of popular lanes (Swiftblade and Ra+a snare) are actually easily countered by beating the everliving shit out of one of them. Ra stuns can be interrupted, Swiftblade is pretty soft in the earlygame, Magebane vaporizes under harassment and so on. 

* Autoattacks are a really big deal. Use them on their heroes all the time. Pretty much anytime you're not being murdered right then and there. Is your teammate being fucked with? Great, free autoattacks for you. This includes every single time someone is not right on your dick and about to kill you, you turn right around and fuck shit up. ""No mana"" is the most terrible excuse.

* Picking redux: Crowd control is the most important quality of a lineup. The best stuns/aoe stuns/teamfight ults win most pub games. 

* Fuck it, some early Ra-counters: Any and all fast or instant stuns, AoE or linestuns and Aluna if you're worried about them hiding in trees. That's it. Ra is really, really easy to deal with early. You have like 3 different lines of defense: Fuck them up before they open, fuck them up as they open by stopping Ra during Path of Destruction with the undisabled laner or at the very worst trade 1 for 1 if the first two steps didn't work out.

* Shut up and play.",,False,self,t5_2r497,False,,,True,t3_p9spq,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/p9spq/because_i_hate_you_heres_some_advice/,

1329848514.0,94,self.HeroesofNewerth,pzluq,Why I think Amun Ra is a design failure,127,33,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/pzluq/why_i_think_amun_ra_is_a_design_failure/,"Okay, so I want to start off by saying that Amun Ra is not OP for competitive play. He is however pretty broken in pubs. He isn't unbalanced, but the design is simply terrible compared to any other hero S2 has released so far. I doubt they will release anything worse and I must say that I have liked the latest heroes very much in terms of design, some numbers might have been doubtful but that's adjustable easily.


------------

Okay, so why do I think Amun Ra is a design failure? There are several things that I will bring up here that are important in a game where everyone are not equally skilled (no pro games). 

Fundamental parts of HoN are things like last hitting, mana management, farming. Positioning, cooldown management. We all know this, I dare hope!

I will be bold and say that Amun Ra's design, in essence, makes core gameplay and techniques trivial. I could be completely clueless and still I will with ease be able to run through the jungle with his stun and AoE and sweep the neutrals in less than a minute, this because of his low cooldown nukes that does not cost a single point of mana at all. After that, proceed to mow down some creeps in the lane.

Moreover, there are little alternatives in how to build this hero, basically all you want is more EHP (effective HP). You basically don't need to consider many things when you build an Amun Ra itemwise, if you just stick to Helm-&gt; Headress-&gt;Steamboots-&gt; Heart-&gt; demonic you'll do just fine in almost every game. And you'll have little trouble farming this unless the game is severely out of balance skill wise.

You don't have to work for your farm, because you don't have any mana that you need to regen up at the well if you're out of it like with every other hero in the game. The only other hero that pays with HP only is Devourer's Rot, but we all know that a Devourer without mana isn't worth much in a team fight.

----------

I am guessing the designers were inspired by Skeleton King from dota (mildly) when they made this hero. For those who are not familiar with this hero you can check it out in this link
http://www.dotastrategy.com/hero-40-KingLeoricTheSkeletonKing.html

As you can see the ultimate is very similar and has a mana cost, but the Hellfire Blast (which is a stun) also has a mana cost. Now I will say that these heroes functions very differently, Ra is a super-heavy AoE damage carry while SK is more of an auto attack carry. The thing with SK is that he has to actually consider his ultimate when he uses his skills in terms of mana, he can be manaburned just like Ra can, but he needs to be careful, even without manaburn on the other team, to not waste too much mana using his stun. 

Ra uses only hitpoints to pay for his skills, well other than the ultimate.  Farming and mana manegement is trivial when playing Amun Ra. In competitive games this works because those kind of skills are already close to trivial, but in most pub games the skills aren't trivial and often they are the difference between a win and a loss. 

This is why so many lower skilled players thinks that he is OP, and to be fair it's quite understandable considering how simple it is to play him. People say Emerald Warden is easy to play, but at least he has to manage mana, learn to last hit and consider trap placement as well as deciding who to silence in a fight. Moreover, he's squisy and position is important. A Ra will almost always build tanky, moreover Ra has an everything-walking spell which makes escape fairly easy. 

In short, the only things you need to consider while playing Amun Ra are global positioning and when to enter and leave a fight. Possibly who to focus down too but all his abilities are AoE to some extent and he doesn't need to animation cancel auto attacks to sustain DPS like most other heroes that are hitting something that is moving. This breaks most normal games and puts most new players in an unfortunate position.

----


How would I fix Amun Ra?
Put some mana cost on his skills, or possibly something that disables health regeneration for maybe two seconds after using a skill so the player actually has to consider running out of farming resources when doing so, like every single other hero in this game. In a game like HoN I would say it is a very big thing if you alter the ability resource system for a hero concept too much. That's why the original Drunken Master concept got a lot of critique from the masses, he didn't rely on mana, only drunk charges. Mana management is a -huge- thing in HoN compared to for example League of Legends. Even if you can run out of mana in LoL you can still use your abilities without many drawbacks even early on. Compared to for example an Andromeda who goes almost OOM after using her stun once on level 1-2.

--------

Edit: Of course after adjusting Ra like this he would require some buffs/adjustments to make him balanced.

Well that's what I think, my fellow HoN players. I would love to hear your opinions as well, I won't deny that I might be wrong or too narrow minded. But this is my opinion and I'm thanking you for reading, if you did.

Repeating again, this hero is not OP, but he is bad design that ultimately leads to this hero being fairly broken in normal games.

------

Edit 2: Just want to mention that I don't think this is just another ""gg s2 fail"". In fact I think it's one of the few fails, if not the only one. I like most S2 heroes except for this one.

----

Edit 3: I don't want to NERF Ra, I want to change him to make him less mindless to play. His potential should be the same, his skill cap should be higher.

1318964107.0,91,self.HeroesofNewerth,lgkkv,"Wingbow vs Demonic Breastplate - which is the armor item, which is the damage item?",109,18,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/lgkkv/wingbow_vs_demonic_breastplate_which_is_the_armor/,"I often get scolded for saying that demonic is a better damage item than wingbow, and that wingbow is a better tank item than demonic (and that consequently, they're miscategorized in the shop) for non-agi heroes. 

**UP FRONT TL;DR**  
(stats on a fully built Jeraziah)

|         | wingbow | demonic |  
-------|---|---|  
| **Attack Speed** | 1.667 attacks/s | 1.667 attacks/s |    
| **Effective Damage** | 307 | 341 |  
| **Damage Reduction** | 70.4% | 66.8% |  

Thus...  
Wingbow = Tank item  
Demonic = Damage item  

Explanation:
_____________________________________
Lets assume for comparison purposes that every hero has an average of 10 armor in a hypothetical game.

***Damage reduction***  

With 10 armor, wingbow adds an additional 4.2 armor - this combines for a total of 46% damage reduction. If you take in to account the 30% evasion though, wingbow gives you, the grand total is 62.2% reduction.

With 10 armor to start, and 15 from demonic, your total reduction is 60%.  

That 2.2% difference may not seem like a lot, but at 3000 HP, you can take about 200 more damage with wingbow before you die than with demonic. Also keep in mind, that part of the damage reduction of wingbow is evasion - meaning that chance-to-proc hits may be avoided entirely.


***Attack Speed***  

Now for attack speed. Wingbow does indeed give you 5 more attack speed. But often times that wont affect your attack speed at all. This is a literal definition here, when I say it wont affect you at all, I mean that the 5AS boost will often increase your attack speed by 0%. If you have two heroes, one with wingbow, and one with demonic, and each are attacking a stuffed puppet over the course of an hour - each of them will most likely get the exact same amount of attacks in over the course of an hour. Why? [Because attack speed falls into bins](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/wiki/index.php/Attack_Speed). A +163 to your attack speed is THE EXACT SAME as a +182 attack speed. It's not until you hit +183 (for most heroes - the numbers are slightly different on magebane and nomad) that your AS changes at all. Can it increase your AS? Sure, if that additional 5 breaks this threshold, but that will only happen around 20% of the time.

***Effective Damage***

Wingbow gives a nice +32 damage boost. Demonic gives none, but keep in mind that Demonic does a -5 armor reduction. Assuming the other team has an average armor of 10, that means you have an effective 24.2% damage boost with demonic. If you're sitting at 200 damage before you grab a wingbow or demonic, you'll end up with 262 or 232 damage with the wingbow, and 248 damage with Demonic. A clear winner for any non-agi heroes. But even with agi heroes, during a long match you'll often become fully built. At 256 base damage, demonic's armor reduction surpasses the damage boost that the agi from wingbow gives you. So for end game scenarios, demonic is often a better choice for damage output than wingbow.",,False,self,t5_2r497,False,,accursed,True,t3_lgkkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/lgkkv/wingbow_vs_demonic_breastplate_which_is_the_armor/,

I was just going to have you guys guess a line of the patch notes and I will tell you what it is. But... you have all seen this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/LrIOvzF.png) already. So just having you guess the line straight up would be boring. You already know where to start...

So I scrambled the order of the sections!

General, Heroes, Items, Bots, Matchmaking, Content, Bug Fixes. Those 7 sections are now in a random order in the notes. I have to make it interesting at least!

The patch notes are exactly 697 lines long. Some lines are MUCH longer than others. Some are blank. Some are headers. Choose Wisely.

**Rules of the Game:**

* Pick a number between 1 and 697.
* Each person gets 1 (ONE) guess. As I see each reply I will look up that line on the notes and let you know exactly what it says. I will not get to every single reply, but I will do my best.
* Use your collective knowledge and put together the patch notes early!
* Don't ruin the fun for others. Don't be rude or a jerk.

HAVE FUN!

You all know me. 2 years ago I signed a contract with S2 Games, signed by Laura Baker, Shawn Tooley and Marc DeForest. A couple weeks ago I've found out that you're cutting funding to the only remaining ""neutral"" eSports news site that covers HoN, i.e. Gosugamers.net that I've been a senior editor at for the past year and a half.

I've been trying to reach someone from S2 so I can terminate my contract for the past 2 weeks but received no answer. The contract I signed with you was mostly in regards to an NDA agreement for an indefinite time frame that can be terminated by either side at any time. Considering I do no longer work for you, I would like that contract to be terminated. Unofortunately, all of the people that ""know"" who I am, all of the people from S2 that I communicated with in the past like Shashi, Laura or Shawn are no longer in the company so I have no one to contact to. I tried to contact the people in charge for the past 2 weeks via Nick and Sam, but received no answer.

Please contact me, thanks. ",,False,self,t5_2r497,False,,,True,t3_1dhrv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/1dhrv9/to_s2_staff/,

UPDATE:  Currently adding CSS to the sidebar!  Will update when its ready!! :-)
UPDATE: 3/20/2013 3:00AM EST - I have a basic shell of the sidebar updated while the CSS gets made.  Will be resizing images for the sidebar as well.  If there's anything missing, wrong, misspelled, etc let me know. Will be working on it more tomororw and into the weekend

FINAL UPDATE:  I will be updating the Upcoming Games manually for the next couple months while the CSS gets made.  Once it's ready we will update it and I hope it meets everyone's expectations.  Thank you!

1312029795.0,83,self.HeroesofNewerth,j436f,"Okay F2P players, Heroes you should try to purchase first to improve your odds of winning!",95,12,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/j436f/okay_f2p_players_heroes_you_should_try_to/,"Okay, so before you click, ""Buy Blood Hunter"" there are a few other heroes you should really look at buying first. I'll put a mini description, and why you should pick these heroes up first before other ones. Do take note that most of these will be support/disablers/initiators. Those roles are what really win games most of the time! A lot of these heroes are expensive, and will take some times to get, thus each purchase should be meaningful. Hence this guide. 

A quick/not so quick blurb on roles:


Nigma's Prodex gives us different roles, Initiator, Support, Ganker, Carry, Disabler, and Pusher. I personally  consider Disabler and Pusher underneath ""Support"". Also Survivability isn't really a role, more of a factor...

**Initiator-**

An Initiator starts fights. Usually with a massive AoE disable like Keeper of the Forest's ultimate, or Tempest ultimate. They also can be heroes with devastating abilities, like Pharaoh ultimate or Behemoth ultimate. Sometimes they instantly destroy a hero with  Fayde. Displacing an opponent is also an option with heroes like Devourer. These heroes make or break fights. 

**Ganker-**

A Ganker is a hero that usually does a lot of damage early and mid game, but tend to do poorly at the end of the game, unless they're farmed to no end. They're main goal is to kill people. If they aren't ganking they're probably doing it wrong. Great gankers are Deadwood, Gauntlet and Magmus to name a few.

**Carry-**

Carries deal damage. They usually do a lot of it at the end of the game, but aren't the strongest of heroes at the beginning of the game. The Carry usually has abilities that make the very good at dealing damage, blinks for positioning, a scaling aura, or an ultimate that increases attack speed. Carries can be difficult to play but then again it depends on the carry. Good carries are Valkyrie (A hard carry to play), Swiftblade, Predator, Arachna and Moon Queen.

**Support-**

Support is an interesting position, it blankets a lot of Heroes, when a lot of them can or cannot be played as support. Supporters are really important to the game, and are pretty much shows who wins at the higher ranked games. They're usually easier to play, but harder to master. Some supporters heal like Jereziah, and some cause your opponents to go bat shit insane, like Blacksmith. Usually they have abilities that help and ""support"" their team.

**Disabler-**

Disablers, disable. They stun, they silence, they slow, they make sure your opponents don't do anything. Most teams a composed of 2-3 disablers, so make sure your team is picking up great stunners. Good disablers are Witch Slayer, Puppet Master, and Succubus to name a few.

**Pusher-**

Pushers push lanes, towers and eventually barracks. These heroes usually are under that support/disabler banner I mentioned earlier. Some notable ones are Pollywog Priest, Defiler, Demented Shaman, and Pyromancer.

**THERE ARE NO TANKS IN HEROES OF NEWERTH.** There are heroes who can take a lot of damage, but they will eventually fall over to the Madman with a Savage Mace, Runed Axe, Rift Shards and Symbol of Rage no matter how fat they are.

Update: While tanks still do not exist in Heroes of Newerth, heroes that take large amounts of damage and deal damage such as Aman-Ra and Kraken are becoming increasingly popular. These heroes still lose to the Madman with every item ever. 

---------------------------


Without further ado, the actual guide :D

**Andromeda**- *AGI-Support/Ganker-90 silver coins*

Andromeda is a powerful support hero that is forgotten by a lot of new players. Her abilities set up some really nasty ganks, and she's got some great team fight potential, by increasing your team's damage with her Aura, and lower you're opponent's damage and armor. Be warned she is rather squishy, so you may want to pick up some strength bracers.

**Bubbles**- *INT-Support/Initiator/Semi-Carry 400 silver coins*

Bubbles is a lot harder than Andromeda, but the reward is far greater. A good initiation by Bubbles can end the team fight before it even begins. With two powerful nukes, a lengthy silence, great mobility control and high survivability, Bubbles can be anyone's worst nightmare. You do need to be careful with him though because his survivability relies on if you have a Portal Key, and can use take cover properly. 

**Demented Shaman**- *Support-400 Silver coins*

Demented Shaman, or DSham as we call him, is probably one the most powerful healers in the game at the moment. His ultimate can make team fights one sided and better or worse the longer the fight goes on for you. He is also the only healer whose abilities are almost all Physical damage as opposed to magical. A good Demented Shaman can win lanes, push lanes, gank and even carry if you've gathered enough gold.

**Glacius**- *INT-Support/Ganker-200 Silver coins*

Glacius is one of my personal favorites. At the beginning of the game he's borderline over powered, he can dish out a lot of damage with only having one point in his damaging spells, can control your opponents and still give your team an excess amount of mana, did I mention this was at level 5? Though he weakens towards mid and late game Glacius is a great hero for people who are learning to play.

**Hammerstorm**- *STR-Ganker/Initiator/Carry-250 Silver Coins*

Hammerstorm is a great hero. A great AoE stun, an armor and movement speed boost, and almost unmatched raw damage. He can be played as any of the three roles I listed above, so he's versatile and you can play him depending on how well you're doing in lane. Though I would highly suggest a Portal Key (A Teleport), and Shrunken Head (Magic Immunity) no matter what you do.

**Magmus**- *Ganker/Initiator-400 Silver coins*

Magmus is the text book AoE damage hero. His ultimate and AoE stun will take out most of the squishy heroes before the fight has even begun. Magmus is a lot squishier than most strength heroes, but he makes up with his incredible survivability. Definitely check out some of the videos of higher teir players playing Magmus. He is definitely a threat to be reckoned with.

**Myrmidon** *INT-Support/Ganker- 400 Silver Coins*

Myrmidon is a powerful and unique stunner. He can make sure no one will catch you, or escape you depending on the situation. Can do a lot of damage early and mid game. His weed field is hard to learn, but once you get it down you'll be giving kills to your carry like your Santa Clause at Christmas time.

**Plague Rider**- *INT-Support/Ganker- **65** Silver Coins*

Plague Rider is an interesting hero. He's probably the only hero in this game that can simply say No to your opponents gaining XP in lane. (Quick tip, when in lane with plague rider, take your extinguish 3rd ability and go to your upcoming creep wave. Use it to deny the creep and your opponents as long as they are not in XP range will not get any XP. It's not a lot at first but makes a big difference later in the game.) A powerful nuke and a devastating ultimate, Plague is definitely a great hero to pick up!

**Pestilence**- *STR-Ganker/Initiator/Carry- 400 Silver Coins*

Pestilence looks and sounds gross, that's because he is. A powerful AoE stun, an on chance auto attack stun, incredible movement speed and his ultimate is pretty much a death sentence. Pestilence can easily carry a team with his abilities, check out Nigma's prodex guide to get a better idea on how to play him.

**Vindicator**- *INT-Support/Semi-Carry- 400s*

Vindi is purely opinionated right here. I love this hero. His whole goal is to just sit in the back and silence your opponents and live. It's almost impossible to fight around a vindicator. And if you're doing well enough on farm and kills/assists, Vindicator becomes a carry that almost no one can compete with. He's difficult to play, but is easily a hard counter to heroes like Monkey King, Wretched Hag, Behemoth, Bubbles, Pebbles, Tempest, pretty much anyone who chain casts their abilities or significant channeling abilities.

**Voodoo Jester**- *INT-Support-250*

Voodoo Jester, is a powerful support hero. A Heal, A stun, makes some damage, into a lot of damage and did I mention he's not a bad pusher? This guys is a legitimate pain in the ass to fight against. If left alone he will win team fights for your team hands down with his devastating ultimate.

**Witch Slayer**- *INT-Support/Ganker-400 Silver coins*

When we say pick a stunner, we really mean to say pick Witch Slayer. When we say pick a support, we really mean pick Witch Slayer. When we say pick a good hero, we really mean pick Witch Slayer. Witch Slayer is an amazing hero. He can CC like no other, has the ability to fight throughout the game with very few items. This hero is one to watch out for. Also use the ult at the beginning of the fight on a squishy opponent, this will almost always cause them to retreat, or be killed quickly soon after. 

That's all I've got, other players feel free to add to it. Make sure you check out Nigma's [Prodex!](http://www.nigmanoname.com/prodex.html)


Heroes you should **stay away from**: Scout, Night Hound, Blood Hunter, Wild Soul, Magebane, The Dark Lady

These heroes do very little to help with team fights, and take a lot of farm before they can preform well, or are very situational. You're best off picking another hero.

Edit: Added The Dark Lady to the, ""Do not play list"" Added Plague Rider to heroes you should buy list.

You totally fucked it up with the hon tour finals. Wasnt this supposed to lure people in by showing the people what THE biggest and baddest competitive tourney in your game had to offer? 
Do you really think people would look at the stream and think ""Wow i wish i could be there doing what they do because it looks fr33kin awesome"". No. 
 How did this happen? Was it a decision made on purpose because the EU/NA isnt that profitable like the asian region is? 
You must have seen your competitors big tourneys right? Even garena set a good example. 
What the fuck s2.. did you really think your community would just swallow this? Oh wait you just force us like i saw in a .mp4 once. Dirty stuff.
Well id like to hear something from s2 but i guess that is just gonna be milkfatty idealistic bullshit defending the mistakes you have made. Didnt they had time to plan hon tour for over 2 years+? Didnt they claim they really dont want to rush it because they want to get it right? 

Dont know if i stand alone in this, but i am fucking done with the lies s2 seems to tell. I feel sorry for myself that i spend around 60 euros on this game.

I wish i could be the naive pubstar and just enjoy the game again. 
Sincerely, fuck you s2 for ruining a good game for me.

1315922495.0,75,self.HeroesofNewerth,ke7p2,An attempt to explain the S2 DB issues in layman's terms.,85,10,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/ke7p2/an_attempt_to_explain_the_s2_db_issues_in_laymans/,"I'm going to try and explain in layman's terms what the issue is at S2.  Anyone who is a true DBAdmin or can explain better, please jump in.

MySQL (and other SQL servers, like Microsoft's) are Relational databases.  That means that the information stored on them
is all linked together, via, you guessed it, relationships.  Let's take the user information as an example.  In an excel spreadsheet, you'd have a ""USERNAME"" column, then a ""PASSWORD"" column, then a ""FORUM_ID"" column, then a ""GOLD_COINS"" column, and on and on for about 2000 columns.

Obviously, managing millions of users this way in Excel is unworkable.  The MySQL application allows the IT staff to break up the tables into 
objects that make more sense.  So ""USERINFO"" becomes a single table that holds their username, password, and say, address. And ""COINS"" becomes a single table, that holds gold and silver info.  Then, in the game, where it needs to show you how many gold coins you have, the program runs a query against the database saying ""For USERNAME = X SHOW GOLD_COINS #"".  The SQL database then only needs to access those two specific tables, and can ignore all other data.

The downside to relational databases is that because of their linked nature, it is difficult to break up a single database across multiple servers.
And when you only have one server, you're limited to the performance of that box.  Even the beefiest of beef will struggle with a big enough DB, but the bottleneck can also be processing all the read/write requests (network or hard disk throughput).

So... enter Cassandra.  Cassandra was originally written by Facebook.  Cassandra basically says that there's no tree of relationships,
just huge tables using identifier keys.  Because there's no defined relationship between any one table and another, you can divvy up the tables on as many servers as you want.  You can put tables that don't get written to much on slower servers and high i/o tables on your strongest servers.

The negatives on this system are on the back-end, making sure everything is working properly and the servers are all talking to each other efficiently.

So what S2 has to do is two-fold. A) they have to convert their relationally-formed data into distributed table form, which is a challenge unto itself to do properly. B) they have to go back to their coding and change *all* their queries to interface with Cassandra instead of MySQL.

Also understand that until very recently (3-4 years) distributed database technology wasn't mainstream.  It is still nowhere near as mature as SQL is.

Now this is purely speculative, but it appears that S2 wants a ""single master"" database to power everything.  So the same database used for in-game info also would serve as the Forum database, and for Customer support, and so forth.  That makes it easy to manage, since everything is in one ""spot"", but it also
forces the scaling issues we're seeing now. 

Anyway, hope this helps.  My background is in IT operations, not DBs per se, so I welcome anyone more db-proficient to chip in.",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,,True,t3_ke7p2,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/ke7p2/an_attempt_to_explain_the_s2_db_issues_in_laymans/,

Lack of information fuels anxiety rather than defuses it.

A large majority of us remain unimpressed by your inability to give precise information after shutting down servers for ""6ish"" hours.

I would just like to point out that if you'd done this correctly, a good crisis response can actually enhance your reputation. When you stick your head in the sand, leaving all arenas free to be dominated by RyanC (which they are right now), you're doing it wrong.

This situation should spur some needed dialogue and change, instead you are helplessly quiet on the forums, on Facebook and here on reddit.

Saying nothing and hoping that the problem goes away or hoping that the community isn't paying close attention is your standard fucking way of playing Ostrich. ""We're hacked, we're working on it."" will *never* suffice.

These are the questions you should answer:

* What happened? Avoid using the word ""security issue"".
* What are the consequences?  Since the hacker claims you haven't patched his exploit, and that he can hack it again on Dec. 25th, how can you estimate the time for your fix to be 6ish hours? 
* Will you take legal action? How will you pursue this? Will you use resources and try to find this guy, or will you continue overpricing avatars and cash in dollars until someone else hacks you without consequences?
* How will you compensate your community for the inconvenience? Fixing the bugs is *NOT* a compensation. You should compensate not only for your inability to secure passwords but also for your inability to communicate.

The reason I am releasing it is because I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person in the whole HoN community and I think it would be a good idea for S2 to fix all of these things asap.


Here is a list of things my ProTip mod does:


**Pro level**


Deadwood

* Rotten Grasp will show up as soon as its casted, as if you were in Deadoowd's team.


Emerald Warden

* Overgrowth trap will show up even if you are on the opposite team.


Engineer

* Spider Mines will show up even if you are on the opposite team.


Fayde

* When in her ult, Fayde will still show up on your screen.


Gladiator

* Pitfall will show up as soon as its casted, as if you were in Gladiator's team.

* Call to Arms will shop up on the ground as soon as its casted.


Madman

* Even in Stalk, Madman will still be visible in your screen.


**Useful level**


Aluna

* When casting bamboo stick, a trail will show up in front of her.

* Bamboo stick will have a trail in front of it.


Chipper

* Rockets will show a trail in front of them.


Devourer

* If cadaver Armor is leveled up, you will have a visual notification on every Devourer's visible enemy heroes that are in a 1150 radius of him. This let you know if Devourer is ganking you.


Pharaoh

* Tormented Soul will have a trail in front of it.


Revenant

* Mortification will show a little tea pot on top of its target. This will let you see invisible enemy unit that have Mortification on them.


Sand Wraith

* His illusion on his ultimate will appear as shadow, but he will remain the same, so you can easily spot the real one.


Silhouette

* Her illusion on her ultimate will appear as a shadow, but she will remain the same, so you can easily spot the real one.


Valkyrie

* Her arrow will have a trail in front of it.


**~~Almost~~ Useless level**


Nomad

* Nomad will shop up in Sandstorm as a tea pot. This is only helpful when trying to cast AOE spells and when he's juking while using sandstorm.

* If Mirage Strike is leveled up, you will have a visual notification on every Nomad's visible enemy heroes that are in a 500 radius of him.


----


I know only a few of these changes are really useful, the other are only extras that I threw in for fun. If you want to remove certain part of the mod, simply open it with winrar and delete the folder of the hero's exploit you want to remove.


**How to install**

Simply put the resourcesProTip.s2z file into your heros of newerth's game folder (e.g: ""c:/programm Files/Heroes of Newerth/game"").
There might be conflict with other mods, so if you want to be sure, simply remove all of your other mods.
There is no honmod file for this, since it should be hotfixed pretty soon by S2 (I hope it is).

Metawolf:

Theme:
What is the scariest thing in the world? A werewolf. So what is even more scary than the scariest thing? A werewolf made out of werewolves. Metawolf enters the battlefield to tip the balance for the Hellbourne.  

Skills:  
Q: Wolfie Tossie - Throw one of your werewolves at an enemy, they will take a nibble and then give them werewolftitus for 1 minute. Any hero with werewolftitus at night gets kind of hairy, no debuff but they get kind of itchy.  Deals damage.  
W: Hungry Like the Wolf - Duran Duran plays over the entire game, you gain a speed boost while moving towards any unit with werewolftitus and gain unitwalking.  Passively increases attack speed always.  
E: Fall in Love With a Baby - Fall in love with a baby, I read it in twilight.  
R: Howl So Hard The Moon Gets a Boner - Makes it night time instantly. You gain Werewolf Baller buff, makes you absorb every hero with werewolfitus to become MEGAWOLF, like voltron but with werewolfs, gain more buffs the more you absorb.


---------------------

Leonardo DiCaprio  

Theme: It's Leonardo DiCaprio  

Skills:  
Q: What's Eating Gilbert Grape - Lose movement speed, but gain retard strength, you hit harder and gain a small crit chance.  
W: Titanic - Stun target unit while you paint it like one of your french girls, you are also disabled during this time, but cannot take damage because you are protected by inspiration.  
E: Romeo + Juliet - Kill yourself.  
R: Inception - A new game starts, new picking phase included, the winning team gets 100 gold EACH in the previous game. If an inception game is incepted the previous bonus is doubled.",,False,self,t5_2r497,True,,pebbles,True,t3_r0jt0,http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/r0jt0/my_new_hero_designs/,

So can you please directly answer our concerns about this program instead of always bringing it back to the ''F2P model was needed'' argument. We are fine with F2P (mostly) the problem is the EAP.


The main concerns seem to be the following:

-We got told we'd get access to all content as soon as it would be up because we bought the game, now we do not.
-This program breaks game balance. I am pretty sure if we check the match history from yesterday MK picks and wins will be incredibly high.

Tell your team they need to send a solo into the protected lane, you can't be laning, you're planning the perfect heist.

Buy one homecoming stone, a health pot, two wards, and as many mana pots as possible. Now port mid, run around their tower so you are not detected. After the first creep wave goes by, plant a ward in between the starting mid tower and the second tower. Use the other ward to spot junglers or to give you additional vision *DO NOT PUT THE WARD IN THE TOWER RANGE OBVIOUSLY*

Wait.

Around 2-3 min in the enemy mid will send their monkey. You kill it, steal their bottle (almost always a bottle), and run back into the jungle.

If their mid chases you, hopefully you have spend those 2 minutes laying mines in a strategic location, collect your bloodlust.

Now go to your lane like a boss.

Replay 87564725 - Didnt get bloodlust but stole Bub's bottle, and our mid subsequently got free farm. xD I tried to transition into ward bitch / support but I'm not the best engi.

Probably never when someone wasn't dicking around.  Maybe in a stream or two.  But that's it.

Let's say you're considering going doombringer.  Right now it's because of one of three reasons

A) You're dicking around because you've basically already won.

B) You're trolling your team.

C) You are behind and you think big damage can help you come back AND you think you can survive a team battle so that you can keep it.  

So we can see that C) is the only valid reason to get it.  But in what scenario are you losing because you're not outputting an extra 250 damage (as opposed to dying too quickly or you don't have shrunken head yet, etc)? I can't think of many.

Add another 50-100 damage to it to really up the chance that people won't just use it as a novelty item.  I remember in dota (not dota 2) pros would go medusa and farm a doombringer equivalent and protect her at all costs to win the game.  That's exciting.  That's the kind of shit that makes people watch HonCast or replays or what have you.  Big plays.  Big turnarounds.  Well anyway those are my thoughts on it.  What does everyone else think?

HoN 3.2 - Salomon's Fortune is around the corner tomorrow morning and we decided to play the patch notes guessing game again since it went so well last time!

How it works is that you guess a line of the patch notes and I tell you what it says. That's it! Here are some ""Rules"" to follow that I used last time:

The patch notes are exactly 317 lines long. Some lines are MUCH longer than others. Some are blank. Some are headers (The first 10 or so lines). Choose Wisely.

Rules of the Game:

* Pick a number between 1 and 317.
* Each person gets 1 (ONE) guess. As I see each reply I will look up that line on the notes and let you know exactly what it says. I will not get to every single reply, but I will do my best.
* If you guessed a blank line, guess again (not as a reply) and I will give you another go.
* Use your collective knowledge and put together the patch notes early!
* Don't ruin the fun for others. Don't be rude or a jerk.
* HAVE FUN!

EDIT: 7:52~ Going to drive home. I will be back in like 10-15min

EDIT: 8:10~ Back

I have very minimal ways to look at items and the stat breakdowns of them while in-game since I only have one monitor :(

This - is where an itemdex would change my HoN experience completely. I would be able to sit there for the couple of minutes it takes to queue (or 10 depending on the time of day) and scroll through all the items in existence and sort by attack speed, strength, agility or whatever. Giving me the tool I need to amplify my theory crafting speed exponentially.

I was talking to one of the S2 lads in game (who shall be kept anonymous) and they basically said that it's perfectly implementable it's just a matter of the ""UI guys"" creating it and then implementing it.

I searched through the reddit history of this sub-reddit and the term ""itemdex"" gives 2 threads - one from a month ago and the other from 4 months ago. So it's something that's had interest for a while.

So please S2..... give us an itemdex! PLEASE!!!!!!!

Anyways, time for some myths eh? :)

--------------

Myth 1: Best player should always play carry.

This is a myth because carry is not the most skill demanding role in a game, sure, a good carry will have wicked GPM and killstreak, but only with decent support (if it's a reasonably balanced game) and initiation will a carry be successful. It somehow seems to me that the kill streaks appear to be a proof of skill to many players, which it really isn't per se. 

A carry jumping in to clean up after a superb initiation from a support or pure initiation hero does not take as much skill as it would seem. Some carries are of course harder to play than others, the skilled players however should (in my opinion) rather focus on heroes like Torturer or Doctor Repulsor, who are carries but they can do so much if the player has good timing and game understanding and turn a game around more than a farmed carry (Let's say Chronos, Pred or The Dark Lady) without the same utility. 

Also these heroes comes into power much earlier. The only things a carry needs to be good at to be moderately successful are last hitting, farming (stack timers etc) and map awareness. What I'm saying is that the best player should (in pubs) play a hero that can take over a game very early and use the advantage well. 

A traditional melee or ranged carry like Flint, The Dark Lady or Predator will not do this in the same fashion as a Silhouette, Torturer or Doctor Repulsor will, even Kraken fits in here. Picking your role is situational, but I'd say a bad support is just as bad to have on your team as a bad hard carry or bad initiator. My point is that the carry isn't always the best player.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Myth 2) Magic armor can't go below 0.

This is a myth that also seems to be very common and the myth has its origins in Spellshards and how the armor ignore function works in comparison to how armor reduction works.
The truth is that magic armor works just like physical armor. Spellshards does not reduce magic armor, it ignores magic armor. There's a difference in how the effects work. Reducing magic armor on a target will amplify magic damage from all sources and can reduce magic armor below 0. Ignoring Magic armor can only, as the term implies, ignore magic armor but not reduce it. This will only affect your magic damage output. 

Example 1: You have Spellshards as Hellbringer and your Life Void recudes magic armor by 6 while Spellshards ignores 6 magic armor. If you use Life Void on a target with 5.5 magic armor the target will have -0.5 magic armor in the end, this means Spellshards are almost useless in terms of magic armor. 

Example 2: You are Hellbringer again with Spellshards and your target has 10.5 magic armor, your Life Void reduces the armor by 6 and the SPellshards will ignore the rest of the 4.5 armor making his armor effectively 0 against you. For all others nearby the target's magic armor will still be 4.5

Keyword: Ignores Magic Armor. Life Void will first apply the -6 Magic Armor debuff and Spellshards will ignore 2/4/6 M.armor after that.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Myth 3: True strike is true damage alternatively True Strike ignores armor.

True strike (feature from Savage Mace) does not deal true damage even if the colour on the popup is the same as the colour of Vindicator's second skill. True strike means that it will ignore evasion properties such as the evasion on Snake Bracelet or Wingbow. 
The damage from the proc is physical, same as the mini stun is.

-------------

Myth 4: Mid should gank.

This is only half true, the only time it is worth leaving mid is if you're sure you're gonna get a rune/kill. Else it's just major waste of time. In fact, some heroes even benefit more from just pushing mid while the other mid tries to gank your lanes. The sidelane players more often than not likes to blame mid for ""not ganking"" when they lose their lane, and this is only true in certain cases.

I will bring up examples because this can be hard to understand as a new player.

Example 1. You are sitting mid as Flint (not optimal mid hero but let's ignore that) and are up against a Defiler. Sidelane cries for gank and they haven't bothered to ward the rune (you didn't bother to do it either, just for example's sake). 

You now have some choices when rune spawns (min 2, 4, 6... and so forth). If you run to try and help your lane without knowing if you will have a rune or not it will in most cases be a lose/lose situation. Why? Because you can't be certain there is a rune there in the first place, also, if the enemy warded the rune they will know you are coming and the gank will be a fail which means you lost gold and experience in shape of creep kills in your lane. Moreover the other mid can push up and damage or even destroy your tower if you leave the lane. 

When and how should I gank then? If you're certain you can get a kill and the time spent doing that is worth it. 

Example: You are still Flint mid against Defiler. You see a haste rune and you have maxed your flare and are level 6 or 7 with a bottle, also the enemy sidelane is pushed up against your tower and your enemies in that lane are in line with the creeps.

Okay, so the chance is there, what do I do to make the best of this chance? You push the lane with Flare, somewhat forcing the other mid to stay in lane (in the case of defiler she can just sweep creeps with first skill but let us ignore that for example's sake). 

Then on your way to the rune you empty your bottle if it isn't empty yet. Don't do this by spamming it, wait three seconds between each use to get the most of it (in case it matters) and the pick up the rune. Quickly use the rune again and run towards the enemy lane. Your teammates should see this and probably initiated already -&gt; You use flare and ulti and get two kills for your team. 

This is the only case where it was worth it. If you stand in the forest and wait for the lane to be pushed up Defiler in mid will have time to push the lane and destroy your tower. If your gank failed the same will happen and you would only lose exp and gold by trying to gank. In short you make it worse for the whole team even if it isn't overly obvious.

So before you go gank because you ""should"", try consider the risk/reward ratio. This can sometimes be hard but never gank blindly just because someone says you should. In some cases Flint should just   farm mid untill he pushed the tower (if possible). This is a game of situations and your job is to decide what's best in the current situation.

---------

Myth 5: Staff of the Master is good on Pyromancer / Witch Slayer.

This is also only half true some would say, others (like myself) would say that it's almost always bad. As I said the game is situation based but I'll get to my point.

You only get 100-200 damage from 4.4k gold spent. This along with some stats. Sure, stats can be good but there are better options if you want stats for these heroes. For example on Witch Slayer Tablet of Command, Astrolabe or even Nome's Wisdom if your team wants the aura. If you've got big money just start building a Sheepstick or a Portal Key. (WHAT PORTAL KEY?!) Yes, Portal Key is basically useful for any hero with an AoE stun and instant disable, making initiation and ganking much easier with the super mobility this item provides for a slow moving Witch Slayer. I can assure you that the mobility will in most practical scenarios provide more success than the damage from Staff of the Master.

In the case of Pyromancer, Portal key is yet again a choice, this because Pyromancer functions rather similar to a Deadwood but with magic damage. For stats I'd also try and get Sheepstick, Frostwolf's skull (only in certain situations) or Tablet of Command (again, mobility is king on gankers). Even Codex is better than Staff of the Master in terms of damage output.

My whole point is, Staff of the Master on these two heroes will almost never ever be worth the gold you spend on it. Mostly because their ultimates are single target and only boosts damage by a relatively minor number.

That will be all for this time, if you'd want more I can make another one. If you see any mistakes or wish to counter my mythbusting, please do so. I'm up for discussion. As the major point of this post was to help and not something else, you will have to ask if you don't understand what I mean or want me to go deeper into some of the myths.

The event was delayed fairly heavily, I'd estimate already 90 minutes, probably will be more like 4-5 hours by the end of the day. This isn't the fault of s2/honcast etc, its just that this tournament is fucking _huge_. It takes 8 minutes to get TO the bathroom, let alone inside it (HUGE crowd).

sG vs Orange will be the next match on stage, obviously delayed, but with luck we'll be underway within an hour or so (theyve yet to play their round one match as of this writing). 

Garena is recording every match id for stats/winners etc so I can only assume that a coverage site will be updated with all of that information in near-real time (or perhaps at the end theyll just do some stats information shit idk)

anyway stay tuned if I learn anything that seems important for the general community to know I'll post it either in here or in a new thread, feel free to link on the forums since the HoN reddit is mostly dead.


UPDATE:

So they had originally told us we would be playing on stage, but since Orange's first match was delayed they casted two thai teams instead. We're setting up now and it should be underway within the next 20 minutes. Honcast will be casting.

I'm hyperxewl from the custom maps channel, creator of the cursed quarry map and the custom ui that makes it easier to connect and host games.

I've being spending the last week or so attempting a massive feat, porting warcraft 3 to HoN.

I'm trying to produce a concept with at least the basics like Alter of heroes and grunts/footmen playable as soon as i can for others in an attempt to boost everyones courage to get into modding, proving that the s2 engine is capable of nearly anything!

There's TONS more done then in that picture, but I would rather not spoil too much/give notes on what's done.

The image is not photoshoped in anyway and most of it is quite functional.

yay etc

If anyone wants to see the full UI

I have a thread on the official forums that I really don't update any longer as I am more into DOTA2 now and haven't made many HoN vectors recently. Hope you enjoy. C&amp;C is welcome.

e: added the rest of the vectors I did for HoN.

I mean which one of you said that, ""hey this is a good way to show we respect our community"". I get it, you're f2p you need people like me to support your game. So why are you doing everything in your power to drive me away? 

ToR is sitting here, waiting for me to play it. DCU would love to have my money. Hell, maybe i'll sell my soul and join LoL. Is that what you want S2? Is that what 390 coins is telling  me?

S2's official post

http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?t=352678

&gt; As a result of the recent situation with compLexity and it's former team, I decided to launch an investigation on the subject. After contacting the organization and looking into the matter more thoroughly, I have come to a conclusion. In the end, this is simply a dispute between the compLexity organization and their former team.

&gt; It is important to also note that this decision was not to drop the team completely, but to have no presence at the upcoming Dreamhack Winter tournament. The management did research and spoke to several parties before making any final decision and no one individual swayed their opinion.

&gt; In addition, this is the statement pulled from compLexity's press release on the subject:

&gt; &gt; Quote:
While making preparations to send the team to Dreamhack Winter information arose that caused our management concern. After speaking with the squad it was decided that under the current circumstances they would not be attending the event in Sweden. This decision regrettably caused the team to disband.
Any further discussion on this topic is deemed unnecessary.

**BONUS ROUND**: I know a moderator and they informed me that the one to delete PAINTITGOLD's thread was Diva. Woohoo, love that kid.

I've been a frequenter of this subreddit for some time now, and I just have to say: what the hell happened? Yes, the competitive scene of HoN is doing quite poorly and the game probably isn't doing as well as it could be at the moment for a myriad of reasons. But what ever happened to, you know, enjoying the game? 90% of what I've read lately has been just people circlejerking about how HoN is dead and good riddance to it and whatnot. Personally, as a non-competitive player, I still enjoy HoN as much (if not more) than I did when I first started playing back in closed beta. I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get out other than some venting, but r/hon used to be people sharing enjoyment of the game, but now it has become a dota2 and s2 bashing circlejerk.

We keep going through these cycles where heroes are released in an ""over-powered"" state (whether they are or not is still up for debate since we only get a couple weeks to play them until they're nerfed into oblivion). Learning new heroes isn't hard at all, it's just hard to get a sense of how all these new heroes fit into the game when they're introduced and changed so often.

I'd say out of these last few patches, I've *really* enjoyed seeing heroes like fayde, keeper, and BH get reworks (also the update to the hatchet and melee range). Those changes alone outshine martyr, ra, flux, silo, et al. I'd really like to see underused/underpowered heroes get reworks instead of a new hero every 2 weeks. I feel like there was a long period before 2.0 where S2 should have been churning out heroes, and now that HoN has kind of matured as a game it should be fine tuning things instead of introducing new mechanics every patch.

It's a fun game and has given me days of entertainment.  Thank you S2 and thank you other players who have fun in the game.  

Thank you for enjoying me play the guitar in the lobby and using your mic in the game.  It's these people who help make the game what it is.

To those who want to rip on S2 or someone who missclicks I just hope you are not always pissed in the game cause that's a shitty 30-60 minutes of life you just spent.

The simple solution to this problem would be to allow a player to see the vision a ward would give BEFORE he places it.  This could work just like any other AoE spell (showing which areas will be hit) while you have the ward selected and are choosing where to place it.  It obviously wouldn't give vision of the area until it was placed, but you could still see what areas would be covered by placing it at any spot.

S2 has to pay people to make these things, pay money to keep servers up, pay people to create new heroes/items/etc.

They didn't charge anything for the new creeps, nicer looking trees, nicer looking water, and all those other cosmetic changes. Is there any incentive for them to do something like that? Not really. I'm willing to bet the ROI on the nicer graphics isn't so great.

The point of silver coins is so that you can play the game while being able to buy yourself a reward once in a while. The brand new avatars are always expensive but they go down in price eventually. Gold coin sales are pretty much S2s only means of direct revenue, since the game is F2P now. If people didn't buy gold coins, we wouldn't have any servers to play HoN on.

Just take a step back and put yourself in their shoes. You're offering a free game, developed by people you're paying, running on servers you're paying for, plus any other costs involved in running the business, yet if gold coins didn't exist you'd make nothing back. Doesn't seem like you'd be in business too long, would it?

I know there might not be heaps to work with given that it's only a tiny unit, but I'm sure they would make things like giant bloody eyeballs or tiny skeletons that would jump around (of course only being a cosmetic change).

If people like this post, every week I'll go over the new pool of heroes and try and give a quick rundown of each hero, as well as an opinionated categorization of it's difficulty (easy/medium/hard).

Let me know what you all think and feel free to add anything you might find helpful!




**Strength**

[Armadon](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=2):  Easy difficulty

* Melee ""tank"" hero who has the ability to slow and reduce a single enemy's armor, shoot spines in a small AoE around him (dealing physical damage), reduce damage he takes from behind and sides, and finally, increase his movement and attack speed with each spell he casts.  The spines can be deceptively strong, especially when hit consecutively by them.  Good as a laner with a ranged support that can slow or stun.


[Hammerstorm](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=13):  Easy difficulty

* Melee ganker/semi-carry who has the ability to stun in a small AoE, make his melee attack cleave, increase the armor and movement speed of himself and any allied units around him in a small AoE, and finally, increase his base damage by a large amount for a short period of time.  Both his stun and Galvanize ability make him a great ganker, while his ultimate allows him to be played as a semi-carry.  His easy to use spells make him a great hero for beginners.  

[Predator](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=39):  Easy difficulty

* Melee carry who has the ability to leap at a target enemy (dealing damage and slowing), become magic immune for a few seconds, a passive which gives makes him deal bonus damage and heal based on his targets current health pool, and finally, reduce armor to enemies in a small AoE, while increasing the attack and movement speed of any allied hero that attacks an enemy with the debuff.  His leap and magic immune give him the ability to get kills early with the right lane partner and his passive scales well into the late game, making him a good carry choice for beginners.

[Behemoth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=3): Medium difficulty

* Melee initiator/ganker who has the ability to stun in a line (which also causes a temporary wall which no unit can pass directly through), increase his base damage for one attack, a passive which stuns and does damage in a small AoE around him whenever he casts a spell, and finally, deal massive AoE damage and stun around him, with the damage increasing with each enemy unit around him when the spell is cast.  Behemoth's Fissure ability can take a while to perfect, but allows you to stun from long range as well as block enemy units from escaping.   When combined with the Portal Key item, his ultimate becomes one of the best initiation abilities in the game.  Works well combined with a ranged lane partner who can follow up his stun with their own magic damage.  Can roam too.  

[Kraken](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=17): Hard difficulty

* A melee semi-carry/initiator who has the ability to nuke a single target, slowing it and reducing it's armor, charge at a target location, dealing damage, stunning, and moving a the first enemy hero in his path (if used correctly), a passive which allows him to deal bonus physical damage every few seconds and finally,  the ability to place a giant whirlpool at a target spot which drags enemies to the center while dealing damage and stunning if they reach the middle.  By combining his Torrent and Splash abilities, Kraken can take out a huge chunk of an enemy hero's health pool, while his ultimate is great in team fights.  While the mechanics of his charge can be a bit tricky, once you learn how to use them all you'll see how strong of a hero Kraken can be at all stages of the game.  Does well in a side lane with a ranged support but can also hold his own as a solo mid.  




**Agility**

[Flint Beastwood](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=163): Easy difficulty

* Ranged carry who has the ability to Flare a target area, dealing damage over time and slowing any enemies in the flare, a passive which gives his shot a chance to apply a mini stun and bonus damage, a passive that increases his base attack range, and finally, a long range nuke that allows him to snipe enemy targets from far away.  Flint's excellent attack animation makes him a fairly decent mid, but he also does well in a side lane.

[Nighthound](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=14):  Easy difficulty

* Melee carry who has the ability to place an AoE cloud at a target area which slows, prevents casting, and makes them miss physical attacks, pounce behind a target enemy, dealing bonus damage, a passive which makes him do extra damage based on your total Agility when attacking behind an enemy, and finally, a passive permanent out of combat invisibility with a short fade time.  While he has very a very small health, he gains a lot of armor and can do a lot of damage with very minimal items.  Should be in a side lane with a ranged support who can help set up kills with crowd control.

[Corrupted Disciple](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=114):  Hard difficulty

* Ranged carry that can do an AoE ""tide"" nuke around him, steal an enemy heroes damage and add it to his own temporarily, a passive that slows and damages enemies who cast spells on him, and gives him bonus movement speed, and finally, an activatable spell which damages the enemy unit with the lowest health pool in nearby range.  Corrupetd Disciple's has good movement speed and if used correctly, can deal massive amounts of damage early game with his damage steal ability.  He excels as a solo mid as he needs to get some items to boost his health pool.




**Intelligence**

[Empath](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=168):   Easy difficulty  

* Ranged support hero who has the ability to create a link between an enemy target, draining health and healing her for the amount drained, place a wall at a target point which allies can pass through but enemies cannot, a passive aura which gives all allied heroes bonus health point regeneration, and finally, the ability to jump inside of any allied hero, giving it bonus attack speed and damage as well as a sub-ability that allows her to boost the movement speed of the hero she is inside for a short time, all while still being able to use items and cast her spells.  A good support hero who can lane with almost anyone.  Her Essence Link ability allows her not only to harass/chase but also stay in lane by regaining hit points.  Her wall can trap enemy units in as well as save allies during a chase, and her ultimate may give your carry an extra boost over the enemy, as well as save her from impending doom.

* [S2 Empath Spotlight Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ECoEL-jRi0&amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;list=UL)

[Voodoo Jester](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=27):  Easy difficulty

*  Ranged support hero who also has the ability to deal out good overall damage.  His Acid Cocktail ability allows him to dish out multiple 1-second stuns.  Can also target an ally to heal it and any nearby allied unit around it.  Strong laner and ganker.

[Witch Slayer](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=120):  Easy difficulty

* Ranged hero, who is one of the better supports in the game. Excels as a roamer/ganker.  Has many crowd control abilities which include an AoE line-stun, a hex, as well as a mana drain.  Ultimate ability allows him to cause a single burst of mass damage to one enemy unit.  One of the easier heroes for those new to the game.

[Demented Shaman](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=43):  Medium difficulty

* Ranged support who has an AoE heal/damage.  Can place a buff on an allied hero which heals him if he takes a fatal blow, as well as gives him bonus attack damage.  His ultimate allows him to increase his ally's armor or reduce his enemy's armor in a large AoE.  Excels as a laner with a carry hero.

* [HoN Forum Premium Demented Shaman Guide](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?t=38347)

[Bombardier](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=164):  Hard difficulty

* Ranged nuker who can do massive AoE damage to creep waves as well as in team fights.  Spammable, high damage spells make him an excellent solo mid hero.  Has an ultimate ability that allows him to call down an air strike anywhere on the map.

[Chipper](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=124):  Hard difficulty

* Ranged nuker with extremely powerful burst damage which makes him a good solo mid.  Able to take out a single hero with ease, as well as do great AoE damage in team fights.  Focus buffer ability allows him to put a shield on himself or an ally which will absorb magic damage.

* [HoN Forum Premium Chipper Guide](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?t=271834)

[Parasite](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/heroview.php?hid=194):  Hard difficulty  

* Melee jungle/ganker hero who's Infest ability allows him to take control of an enemy or neutral creep and use it's abilities.  Can steal an enemy's movement speed temporarily and add it to his own.  Has a unique ultimate ability which allows him to transfer any debuffs from him to an enemy.

On my first day of playing, I would go about 0/15/0 or 0/20/1 or some variation like that. I kept playing and playing and mimicking the actions of my fellow players and applying it to my own hero. It sort of worked. 



On my 3rd day of playing I uninstalled.

On my 4th day I reinstalled.



This is 6th day of playing and I am finally able to kill at least 1 person in a match by myself with Pollywog Priest. 

So for any new players out there that are constantly being destroyed every match, don't get discouraged, just keep at it and don't take it to heart when you die. Just learn from your mistakes by watching your replays, and learn strategies from pro player streams. Good luck!

It'll get better, :).

**EDIT:** Wow, didn't know this would even get this high up on /r/heroesofnewerth! I posted this in hopes that, at max, one other noob other than myself would know that, through time, your skills will improve.

Just adding a few things:

- **DON'T RAGE-QUIT!** Even if you are losing terribly, play through a match so you know what happens, the tides may turn sometimes.

- Play 100x more conservatively. So you're 5 levels lower than the rest of your team? That's better than dying and giving the other team **5 MORE** levels that your team.

- And what I find most important, **just talk to your team**. Let them know that you only see 4 red dots on the mini-map and not 5. Even if you are not farming ultra-pro or doing early game ganks, if you tell more experienced players that something is wrong, they can better save themselves and possibly win the game.

P.S. Thank you everyone for the messages! :)
