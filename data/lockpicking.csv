1363226702.0,77,self.lockpicking,1a9b9z,I've been tasked with breaking into a safe (with the owner's permission). Any advice?,94,17,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/1a9b9z/ive_been_tasked_with_breaking_into_a_safe_with/,"I work with a theater company in Chicago that has been there since the early 1980s. When they moved in, there was a GIANT safe in one of their closets, locked and without a combination. For the past 30+ years, it has sat in the closet, unopened. 

It's time to open the safe.

I have permission from the theater company to do anything to get in: hit it with a hammer (tried, doesn't work), attack it with an angle grinder (tried, doesn't work), scream in frustration (tried, doesn't work). As long as the theater itself is protected, any tactics and techniques are on the table. Alas, in my zeal to use an angle grinder, the combination dial was totally destroyed, so the one thing that might be impractical (impossible) is actually figuring out the combination.

It's also probably impossible to move the safe out of the theater... There's no elevator, and the safe weighs at least five hundred pounds. Doing research on the Cincinnati Safe and Lock Company, it looks like the safe is around 100 years old.

Any thoughts or advice? If you're in Chicago and actually want to come try your hand, I'd love to meet up. I have no money to offer, but you can get a share of whatever's in the safe. It could be diamonds, pirate's treasure, thousands of dollars, mountains of cocaine. Or it could be totally empty. 

THE MYSTERY IS KILLING ME!

(My actual guess is that it contains boring financial papers from whomever was in the space before the theater company. But I want to know!)

[I also have photos](http://imgur.com/a/Thxhk), if you can somehow break a safe via the Internet. I'd also love suggestions on other subreddits that might be interested or knowledgable about such things.

EDIT, 3/31/13 - I tried finding a locksmith on Craigslist, but no dice. I tried using a drill, but no dice.

Impressed with how quickly it opened, I removed the pick and... the cylinder fell out into my hand. What?

Up until this afternoon, I'd never even heard of a lock with a 'control' function like this. Turns out of the two possibilities, I had picked the 'control' variation and the cylinder popped out... and relocked itself in my hand.

Now I'm sitting there with the cylinder in my hand and no idea what's just happened... a few minutes on google and I figure out what kind of lock I'm holding, that there are two keys, and that I need to *pick it back*. Damn.

I find that without a clamp or anything of the sort, raking is useless. I start SSP'ing and after about 5 minutes the wrench gives!... but I've picked the operational variation... nuts.

About a half hour and some experimentation later, I finally pick the control variation, reinsert it into the handle, and pick the operational variation.

'When lockpicking saved the day.',70,14,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/1a4avr/stories_when_lockpicking_saved_the_day/,"ITT: real life stories and scenarios where you were able to save yourself/someone-else significant time, money, inconvenience etc. by using the dark art of lockpicking.

I have a few and would hear of yours.

**Padlock**
My first place of work was a business that sold powered equipment. Myself and my co-workers were all junior sales people, learning how to flog stuff to people who need it.
We were on commission, and if you missed a sale, you missed a bonus (which was critical, because, as I said - we were all junior and not well paid).
A mate working there had sewn up a deal on a machine, and was ready to take the customer's money when he realised the only one left was the display model in the showroom.
All the display models were chained together with a padlock to prevent theft.
No problem, knock a hundred bucks off the display model. All good.
Now where's the key?
Who has the key?
Anybody?
Bueller?

Key can not be found. Customer is ready to go buy one somewhere else, because he needs the machine that weekend.
I come in to check what's going on, find workmate in distress, grab picks from car - 1 minute later, lockpicking saved the day. Customer takes machine away, workmate does the deal and gets his commission.

**Daihatsu Charade**
It is 10pm on a Wednesday night, my phone rings and there is a number I do not recognise. It is my friend's little brother.

""Uh hi, mightybonk... Are you at home?""

""I am, indeed. Why?""

""I'm around the corner and I've kinda locked my keys in the car.""

""I can drive you home to get the spare set, no problem.""

""There is no spare set.""

""OK well have you called a locksmith?""

""He charges $180 to come out now.""

""Well why not wait until tomorrow?""

""I've locked the keys in the car with the engine running in my friend's driveway. People are trying to sleep, the car will be out of fuel by the morning and have different problems, and the locksmith will still charge $80 to come out.""

""OK, I'll be there in 5 minutes.""
Got there, and we tried another couple of bypass techniques as it was an old car and I didn't want to wreck any of his locks.
Wedging the door open and try to get coathangers etc in. We managed to turn the ignition OFF with a coat-hanger, but then while trying to retrieve the keys we dropped them on the floor.
I admit defeat, and ask if it's OK to risk damage to the lock.

""Yeah!""

Bust out the auto tensioner, and a springy double-sided auto lock raker tool I had.
2 mins, we were in the car. No damage to the lock. Saved half a tank of fuel and a locksmiths fee for my mate's little brother.
... and do you think he made good with a 6-pack of beer? Fucking nope.

**Toyota Hilux/Tundra**
Same story and tools, different place and vehicle. Lock the key in the work-ute. No spare. Had to do a delivery, no time to stuff around.
Lockpicks to the rescue, inside the vehicle in 5 mins. No damage to lock.

**The rental property**
Moved house long distance last year, into a rental unit which had no wide access except through the garage.
We arrived late in the afternoon, after a 1000km drive with a huge trailer full of our stuff - only to discover a mystery padlock on the garage door, which we were not provided a key for.
Ring the real estate agent:
""Oh, we don't know about that lock... we can try ringing the landlord, but they never pickup at night.""

Wife says do it.

I say ""Stuff this. I'll pick it. I'm not sleeping on cardboard or paying for a hotel.""

2 mins later, the lock is off and we can get our furniture inside.
Real estate rings back

""Hi, we're really sorry. We can't get the landlord on the phone.""

""Don't worry about it. We took the lock off.""

""Ummm... how?""

""Oh like one of our keys worked on it, somehow. Just lucky I guess.""

edit: I reached out to NYCDOT who cuts them off once in a while. I will also invite the media. I've also invited some very well known people in the locksport scene, who I've known for a decade.

Don't carve your initials in Central Park trees, don't mess with the Brooklyn Bridge.

I'd say your best bet would be to get a hold of two videos: **Lockpicking for the New Mellenium** and **A Visual Guide to Lockpicking**. After watching these two videos I was immediately hooked. I found them on /r/baconbits, but if you don't have an account there I think they can be found on Demonoid. Also, the [MIT Guide to Lockpicking](http://www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/MITLockGuide.pdf) is a pretty decent free ebook, but it can be a bit tough conceptually if you aren't yet all that familiar with lock internals.

When buying supplies, start off small. [LockPickShop](http://www.lockpickshop.com/) has a number of sets ranging from $20 up to $250+. I'd suggest going with the [PSX-14](http://www.lockpickshop.com/PXS-14.html) since for the price you get more than you'll ever need. Also, there's a promo code ""LSI"" that will give you 10% off. 

The most important items, though, will be practice locks. Don't practice on an installed door lock since it has the possibility to mess up the lock, and then you have a problem on your hands, especially if it failed in the locked position. My best suggestion would be to hit up places like Goodwill or eBay as they often have used ones that work perfectly. Remember, you don't need a brand new shiny lock. You don't even need a key. Just be sure that you're *getting a lock that matches your level of skill*. Getting something too tough will just de-motivate you. Also, if you're willing to pay the money, you can buy a set of practice locks on eBay. They come in a set of 5 and are pinned from 1 pins up to 6 pins, which allows you to work your way up in an incremental fashion. What I did was I bought a set of five 5-pin locks and just took pins out of them to make my own practice set, which saved me a good $30, but at the cost of having to prepare it.

Practice daily. Learn to feel the internals as best as you can. It will take a while but rest assured it will pay off. 

Your next best bet is to start interacting with the online community, even if it's just reading posts and getting familiar with it. There's so much free information available that you'll never be able to get through it all. There's http://www.lockpicking101.com/ which is a pretty nice forum, albeit they can be rude to newbies at times. There's also http://www.keypicking.com/ which is a lot more open and friendly, but harder to navigate. 

There's [/r/lockpicking](http://lockpicking.reddit.com/) and [/r/locksport](http://locksport.reddit.com) here on reddit, both of which I help moderate. As you can see by looking at them, they aren't too popular, but we'll see what the future holds.

Here is a [pic](http://www.eas-labels.com/EAS/pic/Soft%20tag/security%20labels.jpg)

Well, you can use them to slip in between the sesame combo's dials to detect an anomaly in the reel behind the dial. 

[An example of what I am talking about](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVucdFUi1cw). 

Well, here is my personal tip for using these. They are hard to hold with your fingers as you turn the dial. I use an [X-acto knife](http://www.rccoh.com/IMG/tools/x-acto.knives.jpg) to hold the strip in place. I replace the blade with the little metal strip. Its much easier to hold the x-acto knife-handle than the little strip. I also use a small pick to turn the dials as my fingers often get in the way.

I've been doing my research here and on Wikipedia and other lockpicking forums, and these both seem to include some good basic picks without breaking the budget. I'd like to keep the price under twenty-five dollars, and both of these are under twenty, which is nice when you consider that shipping will add. The SouthOrd is cheaper and has an instruction book, but it only has one tension wrench, and I've gathered that more of those is usually better. The Sparrows set has several tension wrenches but loses the ball pick to add a second type of rake. I know that if I stick with the hobby I'll probably want to expand my pick set eventually but at the moment I'm just looking for something to cover the basics that isn't missing anything crucial.

Most of the videos I see people are pretty rough with these, especially considering they are just spring steel &amp; you have to jiggle them every which way. 

Regarding the **Oops**:

So my friend /u/tehrabbitt called me saying he was locked out of his car. How he left his keys in the car &amp; locked the door, I have no idea. So I show up, all I really have in my kit of stuff is an air wedge, one of those plastic wedges, set of jiggler keys &amp; a coat hanger. We tried the wedges + coat hanger a few times without much success.

The cops showed up, they didn't seem to mind us looking like we're trying to break into my friend's car. They said they can't perform unlocks/help out anymore for whatever reason. I guess it's a liability issue for them. 

So I had the idea to try using my set of jiggler keys. Mind you, I haven't used these before (no auto locks to practice on) but I've seen plenty of videos &amp; I figured this shouldn't be difficult (car is an older 88 Oldsmobile; horrible car if I ever seen one).

After a few attempts along with trying out several of the keys the lock mechanism *falls into the fucking door*. My friend at this point is livid. Let's just say I'm glad it was the passenger door. Luckily, he was able to engage the lock/unlock latch from here; (I'm guessing this is what people are manipulating when they use slim jims) successfully entering his car. 

He thanked me for fucking up his car further, this allowing him to get into it.

My friend's dad Steve had just finished up installing a new door from the garage to the house, and I asked him about the lock, and if it was any good. He said that it probably wasn't, and somehow I brought up picking the lock. It turns out he had a set of picks there in the garage, and I set to picking the old lock on the old door. 

Their foreign exchange student Matt was very interested in this, so I explained to him how a lock worked and he gave it a try. He couldn't quite get the new lock, which Steve had told me to try and I'd raked open in a few seconds, so I found the TOOOL PowerPoint on lock picking to show Matt. I figure I'm not the greatest teacher, plus the language barrier gets in the way slightly. When it was over, he said he had a much better understanding of the process, like how he didn’t know he could overlift the pins. Steve had found some old padlocks, as well as their old front door deadbolt. The thing was hefty, but I don’t know what brand it was. I picked a couple padlocks, but wasn’t in the most determined mood and didn’t get the old deadbolt just yet. After a few hours, and after dinner, Matt says “I got it”. He’d picked the deadbolt.

I was introduced to lock picking by a locksmith who happened to be staying at the same hotel as me. I met him at the hotel bar and got to talking about our professions (I'm in IT). After buying him a few beers he gives me a small switch blade pick set and asks me to follow him to the mens room. Normally this is where alarm bells start going off but hey, what the hell, I was pretty buzzed by this point and this seemed like an okay request. 

He proceeds to show me how to pick the lock for the paper towel dispenser explaining what hes doing then has me try. Somehow I am able to get it after a few tries. Was pretty much the best feeling in the world. We parted ways and I then proceeded to try and pick every single lock I could get my hands on. 

I still use that set to this day and has come in handy more times then I can think of as my friends always seem to be calling me with lockout jobs now. 

TLDR: Followed a locksmith into the mens room and learned how to pick locks. No homo. ",,False,,t5_2qh7k,False,,,True,t3_j2bwm,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/j2bwm/how_did_you_get_your_start/,

I could not get it apart with a screwdriver (I've only rebuilt one doorknob assembly before and it was not like this) so I resorted to my wallet. The door had a trim hiding the bolt but I was lucky enough to have a library card just flexible enough to bypass it and shim the door open. I was possibly more relieved than the doctor on the other side of the broken door but my library card was not as grateful. My question is, is there any certain piece of plastic stock that makes a flexible yet durable shim that any of you keep on your person?

That being said, I'm having trouble.  I bought a PSX-14 set online as was recommended by the 'New to Lockpicking' post on the sidebar, and read the 'Formerly known as' MIT Lockpicking guide.  I found [This](http://i.imgur.com/HJ6YG.jpg) [\(Bottom\)](http://i.imgur.com/vxQQP.jpg) [\(Key\)](http://i.imgur.com/8tQcd.jpg) 'Excel' lock laying around, and figured it would probably be as good as any for learning.  

I'm using [These](http://i.imgur.com/yebNW.jpg) [\(2nd view\)](http://i.imgur.com/t22vs.jpg)  picks, like [This](http://i.imgur.com/8ZhTh.jpg) and as far as I can tell, I'm not even getting the first pin set.  I'm applying more tension then I need to (or, so I think - I started with little tension and built up as slowly as I could until it got to the point that I actually bent one side of the tension wrench (very slightly)) and using the picks to push the first pin up, but it's not locking as far as I can tell.

Now, am I using the wrong lock for this purpose?  Would I be better off stopping at ACE or Home Depot on the way home from work today and picking up a different kind of lock, or is it something I'm doing wrong?  I live in the USA, in eastern Pennsylvania (philly suburb) if that dictates what kind of locks would be best suited.  I considered ordering one of the lockpicking practice locks, however I wanted to put some time/practice in this weekend and can't get anything shipped until Tuesday at the earliest.

I'm a very patient person, and this is a skill I've always wanted to learn.  I'd like to be able to become active in the community here, and I'm more then willing to put in the time needed to learn the skill, however I feel like I'm either doing something fundamentally wrong or this is the wrong kind of lock to be learning on.

I've found some sites that said ""don't cause an international incident"", and I've been meaning to pick this up for a while. I was going to wait until I was back in the States but I wanted to tackle two things in Taiwan.

1) I locked myself out of my room earlier this year and we tried to open it with a key but failed. The theory was that the chamber was perhaps rusted over and that caused the key to fail. Recently, I've been watching lockpicking videos and was wondering if it could be picked open? I'm not good at looking at lock types, but it looks like a simple lock one finds in cheap doors (my one on my room in the US can be opened just by applying pressure with a straight paper clip). Seems a bit harder than that, but probably more like a filing cabinet lock.

2) There are some weird locks (or rather keys) here. I saw something on tubular locks, which seems to be basically a hollowed out cylinder as a key. However, some of my friends have keys that look literally like a solid cylinder. Is that harder to pick? The third is that there is a kind of lock here that is a multi-turn lock. Are those any harder to pick?


I also have some general questions such as
1) Is owning a set of lockpicks in Taiwan legal?
2) On the FAQ or something it says that the basic PSX-14 or something like that is made for US locks. Are Taiwanese locks different generally?
3) Just curious, is it dangerous to post pictures of keys online [that you rely on] since you can kind of tell what kind of lock it is and such?

1360275323.0,21,self.lockpicking,183b73,[Lockpicking] Some pics of the inner workings of my home-made Plug Spinner. Slightly different design than the original.,27,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/183b73/lockpicking_some_pics_of_the_inner_workings_of_my/," I made a newer one than the original. Here is a [pic of it](http://i.imgur.com/OWRCMiG.jpg). What is different than the original is that I found out that because the diameter of the copper tube was small... that the spring and T-ish handle has to be twisted completely 360 degrees for it to be forceful enough to turn the plug once tripped. ANd only one cut notch (on the pipe) was needed (instead of two). The T-handle had to be made so that one side was lower than the other so that only that side would fit into the single notch. I hope I have explained it adequately enough.

[Here is a pic of it disassembled](http://i.imgur.com/hN7gv8j.jpg) 

There was still a problem with the copper tube being too soft and the notch becoming worn down after use and the t-handle not staying in place once set. To fix this I took an old golf club that had a metal shaft, and cut the tube from the lower section. Dremelled in a notch on one end (for the T-handle to fit in) and a slot on the other (so the spring would stay in place.  

[Here is the final result](http://i.imgur.com/K5qjl51.jpg)

I just received my 5pcs set from Southord as my first set of lockpicks and obviously grabbed a lock I had laying around to start getting some practice (and maybe even **gasp*\* open it!), and so far, no luck on the opening part, but I did manage to start to get a feel for the pins.

Now I read a bit around here and other forums and a thing that always comes up is NOT TOO MUCH TENSION, but I'm running in a little problem. I'm able to put just enough tension that if I let up just a tiny bit the pin(s) will fall back down, but even at that tension level, I can only bring up one pin; I'm not able to push another one up.

I'm trying on a Master No.140 that's a bit used, but nothing too extensive, so basically, I was wondering if I should get a brand new lock (I read that Masters No.3 or No.5 are good starting locks) or if I'm just doing something wrong.

Some of the lower-quality ones I can find the binding order really easily, and can pick them pin by pin pretty easily. They are too easy with straight raking. Do higher-security or higher-quality locks have a more secure system? I have one that I just CAN'T get any feedback from when I feel each pin, I can never even tell if it's binding or not, and they always feel heavy. It boasts no additional security features, and I have got it open with raking/picking just brute force, but I can't learn from it. Any tips there?

I guess my basic question is how do I get better at single-pin picking?

I told her I would have a shot at picking the lock, but not to expect anything much as I was pretty  inexperienced. I went at the lock, observed by an amused audience of my friend and his flatmates, but gave up after ~5mins because it was taking too long. 

Later on the locked out girl's alarm started going off, the second time that day apparently.

backstory:

I maintain foreclosed homes for banks. I have been doing this for about 3 years, one of the main things that I do it lock changes. When I arrive I have to find my way into the house without damaging anything. Usually (they way we taught at work) we just drill the locks which is generally very easy with the exception of schlage locks. After working here for a while and having trouble drilling a few locks I decided to get a pick set off amazon, I started practicing and got pretty good and it. Now to the story of the picture...



Sometimes I have to do evictions with the sheriff. I'm supposed to arrive just before the sheriff and give them access to the property. 70% of the time the people have already moved out and are gone, this happened to be one of those 70% times. If the house is vacant like it is supposed to be I will look for the easiest point of entry, usually a window, in this case it was a newer house and it was secured. No big deal Ill just go get my pick set... I had left it in my personal truck which was at the office about two hours away. So I found a small screw driver and bent a key ring, it only took me about a minute to pick it. Needless to say I was happy and my two coworkers were impressed.

I ran into my apartment, got my set, and went to work. Considering it was just a standard Kwikset (regular pin-tumbler, not a SmartKey), it didn't take long at all.

We have a team of players that did very well last year but some of last years squad can't make it this year. We have the hacking part of the Hackfortress team covered but need a good locksport enthusiast and some TF2 players to join in. Care to throw your hat in the ring?

Quick explanation: Hackfortress is a 2 part TF2 game. While the TF2 players play, your team of hackers works on hacking challenges that give the TF2 players advantages in the game. For example, when they complete a hacking challenge your opponents might burst into flame, or you get 15 seconds of mini crits etc... Some of the challenges have to do with bypassing physical security hence the need for a lock picking person.

Anyhow, I decided to give it a shot on my apartment door's lock and all be dammed that after about 10 minutes I felt the tension break and the damned thing opened! I tried again and I managed to open the door three more times before my legs started hurting from kneeling on the hard floor. 

So, I am super excited and I think i'm addicted. just feeling that tension break was so awesome. 

Here are a few questions I have. First, I know how tumbler locks work I watched a bunch of videos and read a few books so when I started I understood how the lock worked but what I don't understand is why the lock opened when it did. 

I put the tension wrench in, put some light tension on it and dropped the first pin, then I kinda went through them all one by one and then I could slide the pick in and out to the back of the lock without any resistance from the pins but it didn't open there. Is this a problem with tension? 

Am I applying too much tension? Or is there a pin that is not all the way down?

I've recently taken an interest in picking locks, and after having picked all of my cheaper padlocks and deadbolts, I want to try tackling some harder and more like 'real' locks.

Now I've gone out and gotten several SFIC cores (all from Best, some 6 pin, some 7) and a mortise cylinder. One of the 6 pin ones pops open to the control line extremely easily, and I've yet to figure out how to only pick it to the operation line.

The others have been giving me a bit more trouble. I've been going at them for a few hours with no real progress, and no apparent plug rotation (indicated by a line on the cylinder plug). While sometimes it will 'feel' as if is a pin just set, I'm thinking the feeling of rotation may just be in my head.

I'm just wondering what the 'trick' to picking a lock with a control key is? Should I use less tension? More? How do I control whether or not I'm picking it to the control key or to the operating key? What's the difference in terms of the internals of the lock?

Also [here's](http://i.imgur.com/miCx2Wz.jpg) a picture of the cores, just so you know I'm not some punk trying to pick the locks to my dorm room or any locks that aren't mine.

1. Petersons is the way to go for quality (though pricey), especially their GSP series.
2. It's best to buy single pics, not a large set containing a lot of stuff I'll never need or use.
3. Concensus seems to be to get a couple of hooks, a long ripple and a double rake, a half diamond, and PPB regular + lite.


My order is therefore as follows: [[Order Form Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/OSvHd.png)
-------------------------------------
Hooks:

- Hook 1 - Plastic Gov Steel
- Hook 1 DCAP - Gov Steel
- Lifter 1 DCAP - Gov Steel
- Peterson Reach - Plastic Gov Steel

Rakes:

- Long Ripple - Plastic Gov Steel
- Double Rake - Plastic Gov Steel

Diamond:

- Diamond: DCAP - Gov Steel

The reason I went for the DCAP Diamond, was that in case I'm using a diamond to reach under pins, I might as well get the pick with the lowest profile. My goal is really to make this is simple as possible, with the fewest but right tools to do the job.

My primary goals are padlocks to begin with, that I've so far been doing with paperclips (with success) but I'd like to move on to 5 and later on 6 pins tumblers. Not having tried the pry bars, I'm a bit concerned that I might be missing some half twist tensioners, with a slim profile that can fit smaller locks.

All help is greatly appreciated, as I've tried to do my research as well as possible, and look forward to placing the order and getting started.

I got it to work twice, but other than that my successes were minimal.  I then decided to look further into it and developed my own set of tools.  You can see them [here](http://imgur.com/dPFSS).  I filed down keys with high end points so they would fit in the lock and I could manipulate the pins.  For a torsion wrench I used a flat piece of metal that isn't too interesting.

I know I dropped off the face of the earth back in October. I've had a lot going on in the very real world, but I'm back and working on a new series of videos. (Also, for those of you wondering about picks, I'm still working on those as well of course, but that's not what this post is about.)

I wanted suggestions, requests, etc. for this next series, but there's a catch: It isn't actually about lockpicking. It's just about locks. The series will be called ""The Breakdown"" and I'm beginning shooting today. I have a list of 45 locks that I'm going to demo on camera. I'll pull them apart, show all the internal components with nice macro photo &amp; video, and try to provide some context with patent drawings, info on inventors, etc. I won't have that deep background on every lock, but I'll try to provide it wherever possible.

Anyway, here's my list so far in no particular order. Some episodes may cover multiple locks, especially if they are just iterations from the same manufacturer (BiLock original &amp; NG, etc.), and while getting my hands on locks that aren't currently in my collection will take some doing, I'd like to get your requests for any locks you've wanted to see explained to this level of detail.

I decided to finally give it a try after reading the CIA Expedient Key Casting Manual. Basic concept, for those unfamiliar, is to make a copy of a key by pressing it into clay in a form, removing it, then using lead to cast a key to use as the template to cut a regular key. 

The setup is simple enough, but I am experimenting with different casting materials for the duplicated key. I've tried my regular casting materials (smooth-on), jb weld (didn't work very well at all), and lead. 

As usual bubbles are hassle but I've found that if you pour with the mold at an angle with the cut side of the key imprint down that helps out quite a bit by filling up the lowest parts and making it easy for the air to escape.

The regular casting materials worked okay, were a bit too brittle for comfort, had lots of small air bubbles, and takes many hours to cure. Cost is low, relatively easy to mix ratios.

I've never used JB weld for anything before so I thought I'd give that a shot. Took a long time to cure and was super brittle, snapped the key in half with my fingers. I'm a little concerned that this stuff is actually recommended to fix things. Maybe I mixed it wrong.

The lead worked alright, after a few trial and error attempts. But again, it can't be used as an actual key and you have to heat up the metal to melt it.

I'm trying to find something that doesn't require heat to melt the material (like lead), and that doesn't take 24+ hours to cure, and that you could use in the lock after casting, AND that isn't too expensive / complex to work with.

Anyone else ever taken the journey into DIY key casting?

I have encountered a diabolical lock and I looked like a little bitch in front of my employer.,23,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/1fgh21/help_i_have_encountered_a_diabolical_lock_and_i/,"So I am a amateur at best but I can pick with general ease on most regular locks. Well there has been a ton of petty theft at a factory I am employed at and the needed me to help open lockers as they have been around for so long that the master key is lost for 20 plus years. Oh Im not a suspect obviously because I have access to much better petty theft. Mostly tools or things left around the factory floor, if I wanted to I could steal things like computer parts and cash. 

It is an ASE lock made in Aurora, Illinois and when I failed after two hours of picking we pried one open and took apart the lock. It is like nothing I have ever seen: No back plug or cylinder to speak off and best of all no pins. What I found was essential a two stage lock, first bypass I determined would be what I will call keypins. They are narrow and they each have a individually distinct serrations and are pushed forward into a set pattern by an extremely tense copper z fold spring. The second bypass is where it gets stranger as at the bottom of the stack of seven of those bastard keypins is a solid final flat square keypin that has a separate z fold spring. At that point a spring loaded bolt either drops or retracts with a spring that is pressured by the final flat key pin. 

The biggest problem is I do not know what the key looks like as they are passed worker to worker. *Not a racially charged statement* 99% of the workers are Asian and outright refuse to cooperate in anyway when I ask them anything. I maintain and diminish fire danger by controlling the lint levels in the factory (100,000 lbs of cotton garments, linens, and towels a week equals about 200 lbs of lint in formations you would not believe let that build one week and then it is 400 lbs let that continue and you get what happened in Bangladesh. God be with those people, that is my nightmare.) Because all they see me doing while they are there is spraying my air gun and occasionally the odd lint explosions hits worker passing by. They don't see what happens when they leave and I go inside of machines bigger than my apartment. They are the ones with the keys and all I got when asking to look at one of the keys was a very tiresome I don't speak English act.

So any suggestions? I have a titanium Southford with a decent variety of rakes and a good broken key extractor but I have no idea how I can even effectively use a pick set on such a bastard lock. I am too new to sort through internet bravado and falsehoods a google search would provide btw. I will get some pics up in a few hours as my wife is sleeping and my camera phone is crap. Dont fail me Austrailia! 

Edit: by titanium I mean stainless steel, it is very late and I am covered in an unholy cocktail of grease, lint, oil, and nastiness from over 200 hospitals, restaurants and offices.

**Background:**

I moved into a house recently that has a pretty sweet man-cave. The previous owner worked as a maintenance engineer for a local college, and loved to reuse items he has scavenged throughout his life. When he was showing me around the house, he had mentioned that he had purchased the doors from a friend that was tearing down an old hospital. Unfortunately, he didn't have any keys. :(

**My Question:**

Has anyone seen a lock like this? It would be awesome if I could find a key that will work for this door. Any information would be helpful!

**Here's what I know:**

* The lock seems to accept some sort of angled skeleton key.

* There don't appear to be any manufacturer's markings. However, the lock and door handle are attached on the inside with screws... I suppose I could pull the whole thing apart to look for clues (if that is a reasonable thing to do... I'd be afraid to make the thing unusable).

* The door came from an old US hospital in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire... possibly one with a mental ward (so I was told... the owner could have been stretching the truth
* The door itself is about 2"" thick solid wood, with old translucent glass panes that have chicken wire in-between them (kinda matches the old hospital story I guess).

Again, any information on this would be greatly appreciated... How to obtain a key copy, locksmiths that could make such a key, manufacturer of the lock, etc. etc. etc.

Thank you gents!

I finally figured out why my KLOM tubular lockpick wouldnt work. ,13,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/lile8/hey_i_finally_figured_out_why_my_klom_tubular/,"So I have had this thing for a while. And up until just this moment... i figured out why I couldnt get it to work.

There is a allen-head inset bolt/screw on the black ring on the shaft. Well... seems when the thing was made/assembled... either the picks were to short or the hole drilled on the shaft (not the black ring) that the inset screw's tip fits into wasnt positioned far enough down the shaft. Either way.... the sliding picks never exactly reached far enough to the tip of the shaft. (from online videos they say that the picks should stick out a tad farther from the shaft ... mine didnt)

So what I did a few minutes ago was I unscrewed the inset bolt/screw &amp; pushed the black ring down farther on the shaft so that the bolt/screw missed the drilled hole it is supposed to fit into on the shaft. Instead... the bolt/screw connects with the surface of the shaft. This made the picks stick out considerably more at the end. And of course... you push them back to make them flush with the end before you use the tool on the lock. 

[image](http://i.imgur.com/ViORG.jpg)

Its surprisingly easy how well it works now on the simple tubular lock I have been playing with.



Note: also... i found the push button spring feature in the handle VERY annoying, loose &amp; kinda unnecessary. So I tightened the black inset bolt/screw on the handle so the button &amp; spring wont work now &amp; everything is solid.

edit: IF you do this &amp; use your fingers to push the picks down to reset the tool (instead of using the spring handle pushbutton mechanism)... then be VERY careful pushing the pics down so you dont force them &amp; break one.

I'm using (mainly) an Ultimate Practice Lock (UPL) I currently have 3 pins filled. I can rake that sucker open in 1-2 tries w/ my Serepick Bogota. SPP with a hook/half-diamond is harder, but I can do it. I'm working on doing that reliably before I progress to 4 (then 5, then 6, then adding security pins).

To aid my self-instruction, I also picked up a Brookhage clear lock so I can SEE what I'm doing. The binding order for that seems to be 2-1-4-5~3. Those last two may be swapped. Hard for me to tell.

What happens is that using a hook pick, I can set 2, then 1, then 4, then 5 (with difficulties) but then before I can set 3, #2 oversets and I have to start again from zero. I can't poke it and have it drop, I have to reset completely. I've tried 2-1-4-3-5 w/ the same issue occurring.

I've spent too long going over this lock with the same results. I change up the pick order, and tension but still have the trouble with #2 oversetting. It's very frustratingly as I can *SEE* this happening.

This is the basic Brookhage. I haven't touched the Brookhage w/ security pins yet.

I'm being cautious with my tension (light), but as I feel it should be setting correctly, have to fight the urge to twist harder when I feel it *should* be opening. This is more with the UPL than with the Brookhage as I can see it shouldn't be opening as #2 is overset.

What am I doing wrong?!? Thoughts? Suggestions? Scoldings? HELP!!

I read a post where the OP is picking his front door lock, for fun and because he doesn't think it's safe and wanted to see how easily he could get into it. He doesn't seem to understand the risk of breaking his front door lock and making things a hell of a lot more unsafe in doing so.

The key looks identical on both sides, and it doesn't matter which way you insert it into the keyhole. It still works.

I think it says ""ARFE"" on the key.  It feels like the lock has 8 pins total (4 top, 4 bottom), but could be less.

I have tried inserting a double-sided pick that sort of looks like the key, but no success so far.

I can feel pins (or holes) in the lock, but I havn't heard any obvious click sounds when manipulating them. If i release tension after having picked around for a while, I don't hear any clicks at all. So perhaps this lock works differently?

I am a noob and have only picked two locks so far.
Can I get some advice? Thanks!

UPDATE 1: Now I have tried some more and think I've managed to trap pins on this lock for the first time. Reaching the top pins is rather easy, but reaching the bottom ones is hard even if I remove the tension wrench. At least I can hear clicks now when resetting the lock with the tension wrench.

UPDATE 2: Unlocked several times now! When looking at it more closely it appears there are 5 pins total. A piece of black rubber on the side of the lock made it more difficult to position the pick, so I had to press a bit to the right for the pick to ""aim"" correctly while rake picking.

I understand that Masters are crap, but how is it that I don't even have to touch the other pins to get the lock to pop?

I managed to get a key stuck in a lock. I've been told that the lock is a 'double bitted lever lock'. I haven't been able to Google an image that looks exactly like the key, but [this](http://www.historicallocks.com/Other/Historical%20Locks/Articles/Safes%20and%20vaults/Vaults/safes_and_vaults_vaults_10_small.jpg) is the closest I could find.

What happened was that I wanted to lock the front door gate last night, but didn't get the lock properly aligned with the hole in the wall the lock is supposed to go into. So I got the key turned 180 degrees, with the lock half locked. I then jiggled the gate, thinking I could just align it now and then fully lock the lock, however the lock popped back to its completely unlocked state with the key still being turned 180 degrees.

The lock is made so that the key can only be inserted the right way around. In other words, it's not possible to insert (or in this case, remove) the key if it is turned 180 degrees.

So, before I end up with the last resort of having to call a lock smith, have any of you got any ideas for how to get the key out? Keep in mind that I'm at my girlfriend's place and my access to tools other than oil and screw drivers is probably quite limited.

The light force bent the key, however, so I had to stick a screwdriver into the lock where the bent part of the key was, and use another tool to be able to force turn the key a bit. Got the key straightened out so I could get it out of the lock. The key still works for locking and unlocking the lock, but when the gate is closed, I have to jiggle the gate a bit and apply some mild force to get it to fully lock. I guess that's because of the key damage.

This is going to take some getting used to. They are so small and hard to hold on to. They dont glide in many locks like most people have said. I have noticed that you have to use extremely light tension on them. I can use my ""pogoda"" knockoff pick (that has the full handle) better than I can use the bogotas.  I also had to rip apart several different pens until I found a spring that was the right size for them. Most springs seemed a little too small (in diameter) to fit well on the picks' shafts. Just right enough to slide on the handles and to tighten up just a tad as it slid up to the twists on the picks' shafts. 

I may have to stipple or roughen up the handles just a bit so i can get a decent grip on them. Or... i may bend them in more of a right angle like the compact version. 

On master lock #3 padlocks... i can use the single wave pick easier than the three wave one to open the lock. It slides back and forth in the lock much easier than the three wave pick. On 5-pin or more locks I just cant open any of them yet (I can somewhat easily with the pogoda pick). Well, on the horribly cheap knockoff kwikset locks I can. 

Maybe my technique is wrong with these specific picks. It has only been a few days so I am sure I need to practice a helluva lot more with these before I become proficient with them.

edit: For raking...I think i have been holding them wrong. I think the correct way is to put the thumb on the lower bent part section and the side of the index finger at the bend of the pick and then push down with your thumb so that it levers upwards and puts upward pressure on pins.

The car has had it's Ignition cylinder replaced twice in it's life due to the pins wearing out. (apparently GM used very soft metal, I believe aluminum, for the pins on the cylinder for my car)

My parents spoke with a local locksmith who said if I can get the year, make, model, and VIN of the car, he can get replacement keys cut for it for about $150 (they're smart keys with that stupid PASSKEYIII that GM uses... nothing more than a glorified resistor heh).

Anyway, the reason i'm posting is i'm curious on how he will get the keys ""cut"" to the cylinder with just the VIN / and car details, especially since the cylinder is not the same one that came with the vehicle when it was purchased new.  Does it sound like I'll end up having to pull the entire dash off again to replace the cylinder for $500-$600 (half the dash + the steering column needs to be removed)

Even more important, how hard is it to just get the car started (is there a way to bypass the passkey3 as well as i guess pick the lock somehow) so I can drive it to my uncle's who was going to replace my injectors for me since that is why my car has been sitting for ~2 months now (and lost my keys in the meanwhile).",,False,,t5_2qh7k,False,,,True,t3_n7vyh,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/n7vyh/lost_car_keys/,

Are they lock sport or too close to the edge?,11,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/ktvmw/how_do_you_feel_about_bypass_techniques_are_they/,"I notice that a lot of lock sport sites and competitions largely focus on the picking of the lock and the lock alone, and there is less of a focus on the lock mechanism, door hardware and other security.

I often find myself more interested in bypass techniques and attacks against the hardware than picking itself, often largely because of the simplicity, speed, and often inherent lack of skill with which they can be done. Quite a few of them are very clever as well.

However, bypass technique are far more likely to be used by criminals for the exact same reasons.

So what do people think about these? Do they fall into lock sport? Or should they be kept out of lock sport to avoid muddying the already grey legal/moral waters?

Examples of bypass techniques I mean:

* Euro cylinder thumbturn bypass http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4r8Tzwg71U
* Key in lock mortice bypass http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DNVvK-OBw
* Mechanical digital lock bypass (sorry, this doesn't show it well - a thin tool inserted between the escutcheon and door can rotate the thumbturn) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQkWF4SSUFQ
* Bending the top of double doors open, undoing the bolts, and the lock mechanism is worthless (unless it is a claw bolt)
* Carding locks with mica
* Fail open electric strikes on fire exits

You can learn more about Noisebridge here:

A few notes for the uninitiated:
- Bring picks if you have them. If not, we may have some for sale.
- Don't come to lean about breaking and entering. That's not our bag.
- Parking around Noisebridge is terrible. However there is a pay lot adjacent to the venue. Still, try to take public transit if you can.

Out for Christmas dinner with the family, and upon arriving home, we discovered we were locked out of the house.  I had seen a video years ago online about how locks worked, so I pulled out a paperclip and my leatherman Wave (the old one, this one's going on 12 years now).  while i was attempting to pick the lock, my mom was rummaging through her car looking for a spare key.  after 5 minutes or so, she showed up with a key, leaving me unsuccessful.  

I knew she had a drawer of locks she uses on her storage units, these particular ones are Chinrose dx70.  something like that.  she had 5.  3 had keys, 2 did not.  I chose one that didn't, and after a good 20 minutes or so, I had successfully picked it with my crappy paperclip and leatherman.  Terrible tools, but it worked.  I have been unable however, to re-pick it.  I don't know what it's got inside, and I know nothing about locks really other than the couple videos youtube has shown me. 

If anybody knows more about the security features of these locks, i'd like to know.  also, i think i'd have better luck with proper tools as the paperclip consistently bends.  A lot of people have different opinions on here about which kits to start out with, but most seem to say southord are good.  Any in particular?  Link please so I can decide which ones to buy.  

EDIT: http://www.chinrose.com/Disc%20Locks.htm  I guess it's the D70X, not DX70.

EDIT 2: After reading about these ""mushroom pins"" I think i'll be able to re-pick it, as before, i had no idea what i was getting myself into.  Will update tomorrow (hopefully) with results.

EDIT 3: the D70X has become childsplay.  a couple mushroom tumblers, then 3 standard ones (forgive me for my lack on knowledge if my words are incorrect). however, I have some other kind of Chinrose that has no identifying marks other than that it's a Stainless-Steel Chinrose that I cannot, for the life of me, get to open.

  It seems the only way I can even get some pins to set is by raking with no-to moderate tension.  Once in a while I can get one pin to set with my paperclip pick.  I've tried attacking it from the front, and the back (there's a little access hole on the back), to no avail.  I'm sure i'd be better off if I had real tools, but hey, sometimes ya gotta work with what ya got.  and What I've got is a leatherman and paperclips.  

Also, thanks for the tips on tools with which to buy.",,False,,t5_2qh7k,True,,,True,t3_nw3bz,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/nw3bz/i_found_something_i_quite_enjoy_by_accident/,

I'm relatively new to lockpicking, but I've been able to pick most locks I've attempted without too much trouble. However, one lock in particular is the exception to this rule. It's a relatively unremarkable 6-pin lock, save for the fact that the farthest-back pin must be set to the highest possible position. With my *luck*, the pin in front of it must be set to the lowest position, and I often find myself unsetting this pin whilst attempting to set the farther back pin. 

How would an accomplished locksmith approach this problem? Sadly, the keyway is too small to accommodate a hook-style pick.

On a hunch, I removed the problem pin and was able to pick the lock without difficulty. Thinking it was a problem with the way I was attempting to set this pin, I removed all other pins and (after replacing the highest pin to the first slot) attempted to pick the (now) single pin lock. While I was able to, I found I had difficulty bringing the pin up enough to set. Are there any tricks you might recommend for higher-set pins, in general?",,False,,t5_2qh7k,False,,,True,t3_18sxw5,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/18sxw5/difficulty_setting_high_recessed_pins/,

I'm new to the actual physical aspect of lockpicking (Obviously the more important side of it).  I have read a few books and many websites on the theory, and I'm trying to select my first set.  I two main questions:

1. **European/U.S.**  I know the main difference here is that Euro picks are designed for locks with a narrower keyway.  Is there anything else that should be considered when choosing between them?  I live in the US, but it seems to me that buying picks designed for narrower keyways could only benefit me since I would have a little more maneuverability when I'm picking individual pins.  Is there something I'm not getting here? Durability, gripability, anything?

2. **How many picks?**  The baseline sets at [Lockpick Shop] (http://www.lockpickshop.com) are all about 5 pcs.  For that you can get the normal hook, ball, half-diamond, and rake.  But I've also heard a lot about the [PSX-14](http://www.lockpickshop.com/PXS-14.html) set which is a 14-piece set for only $6 more.  This seems to me to be a pretty easy decision based purely on price/pick, but more money is more money is more money.  Are there ""bare necessities"" that I absolutely cannot live without?

Basically, I feel like I'm shopping for these things the way I would shop for anything else, by trying to guess at quality and minimizing my cost/volume ratio.  Are there other intangibles that I need to consider that I have so far failed to?

**TL;DR** How many of which kinds of picks should a beginner buy for how much and why? (Unintentional rhyme)",,False,,t5_2qh7k,False,,,True,t3_t2ot2,http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/t2ot2/questions_about_choosing_a_beginner_set/,

Basically, i've been trying to get into the whole lockpicking thing. Up until this post I've been able to pick about 7 locks, but It's mostly been luck and just shoveling the pick around in there with different pressure.

First I don't know how much tension I need but i doubt anybody could actually explain exactly what pressure to use. (with words over teh interwebz.)

But let's say I got the perfect pressure, how would i push down the pins? I've just pushing em' down quite hard. And they are almost like stuck in the lock so I really need to use some force to push em' down! And I just push them straight down so all the pins are in the exact same height inside the lock.

Are they just supposed to be push down gentle without them offering much resistance except for the spring? 
Should I feel a click when they set?

And the last question, what does oversetting mean?

Also when i type ''push down'' I mean push up but i use padlocks. :D

First, I just practiced sticking a hook in and feeling all the pins individually one at a time. I would give myself a quiz like, ""Push in the fourth pin"" or whatever. Then I took the plug out and removed all but one of the pins. I practiced picking that, applying the correct amount of torsion and really feeling how the pins move etc. Clearly this was extremely easy but I thought it was an important exercise anyway. I added a second pin, and had no trouble picking that either. But with a third pin it's impossible. I have no idea how to pick it successfully.

One thing that's really difficult for me is trying to hold the plug and hold my two picks while also doing something as delicate as picking. Are there any suggestions on what I can do to hold the plug in place so that it's all still accessible for adding more pins as I progress, but so my hands are free?

Are there any other techniques people suggest to help me become good at this other than adding one set of pins at a time to a lock?

What have been your locks progression?

Most of us have started with raking cheap padlocks, then went up SPP onto classic 5 or 6 pins locks.

Most beginners stall at this point. Thought it would be useful to share what did you do from here. What are the next goals to set?

To my mind, the most important training tip is to know how to pick a lock on a fixed structure, mounted both ""pins up"" AND ""pins down"". Event if it sounds stupid, it took me a while to pick the same locks ""pins down"" when the ""pins up"" version only took seconds.

And you? Any tips on exiting the beginner zone?

I am picking a deadbolt (mountain security basic $6 model) and I've removed all but 2 pins. The sensation that I get when picking it isn't lining up with what I expect. Basically, to single pin pick it I have ended up applying pressure to the first pin until I feel a force stopping me from pushing further. I then apply force to the second pin until I cannot push it any further. when I go back to the first pin, I can now push it slightly further and finally if I very lightly touch the second pin again the lock will turn. Sometimes I don't have to go back to the second pin twice but I always have to touch the first pin at least 2x. 

At the first stop on the first pin I can feel the wrench shift into place, and if I feel the wrench shift on the second pin then I don't have to go back to it (but if I don't feel it shift after it stops I do have to go back to it). Regardless, even though the first pin shifts after stopping I have to go back and apply pressure again.

I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong here - this happens with high or low torque on the deadbolt. A mechanical explanation would help?

I pulled the lock out shown and made a [quick video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpQk_u2AGTw) of it.  The lock doesn't appear to have any pins, just two metal bars inside of about a 3/4-inch shaft.  I tried putting a bit of pressure on the bars, but they don't seem to move at all.

Then about a year ago I purchased a set from [DealExtreme](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/advanced-9-piece-set-lock-picks-16417), and a pair of pad-locks and got cracking. I bought the cheapest pad-locks, and defeated them after a while. My problem is that I have a hard time pinning each pin, and what I end up doing just ramming the pick in and out and then eventually I get lucky and it opens.

I figured I might as well try it on a proper door lock, so I went out and bought a ""proper"" lock, looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/JfPiu), but this lock is obviously way out of my league. There are some numbers on the back, which I guess are the positions of the pins, which are (7474311).

My problem with picking still remains though, I have a very hard time to identify and pick each pin seperatly. If this is due to my tools or the lock I'm not sure of, and I've been looking into buying practise locks, but I'm in Norway, and the only one I can find, in Norway, are about $140, which is a bit much.

If there's any video or guide to find the right amount of preassure, that would be great, because people talk about preassure per inch, which is gibberish to me, and need to find out if I use too much pressure.


So what I'm really saying in my long post is, are my tools too poor, is the lock too advanced for me or is it just that I suck?

I saw a [tool](http://www.rvtoyoutlet.com/p-RVT1051.html) in a thread posted recently that looks useful. I have a few questions for you guys, like the title says, what are your primary reasons for lockpicking? My concern is, I don't have a reason. It would be only for hobby and fun. 

Next, the tool I posted a link for, is it worth buying if I'm just starting? I wouldn't mind starting to learn solely with picks, but if that would jumpstart my ability greatly that would be useful for me.

Another q, if I have a laser cut key for my car is it even possible to pick that door lock if I locked my keys inside? I do have a spare, but my buddy does not, just curious for his sake I suppose.

Final question, what beginner's kit should I buy. Price is a priority, I don't mind buying a cheaper set of tools if they'll meet my needs. I don't need the best, but I also don't want to buy tools that'll bend or break very easily. Thanks!

Particularly very minute meta-on-metal sounds. NOT the sounds of the discs contacting each other as they turn. I can definitely feel when one disc catches the other and drags it along with it. So dont confuse that with what I am hearing. 

So far I have three distinct number where they ALWAYS make a very faint metal-on-metal ""tink"" sound. Actually its not just a single number... its maybe a small range of numbers .... like 91,92,93 .... 38,39,40....9,10,11. Well, it IS a single number within each three, I just dont know which one it is definitively.  They can always be heard when turning the dial left, but just barely be heard when turning the dial right. 

Keep in mind... i can only hear these when I  have my ear against the safe door (right next to the combo dial) while turning the dial... and in a very quiet room. And like I said earlier ... after the discs have all connected and are dragging each other around. So it is not the discs making contact with each other. It is something else. What exactly is it?  

I have an idea of what I am hearing, but I need an objective opinion.  

Note: I know how the inner workings of a combo safe works. The gates, the nose, etc etc.. I have even managed to figure out another safe's combo numbers by opening the back of the lock and seeing where the gates line up, but it took me forever back then because I knew nothing about it. Note: this one had four discs instead of the typical three.

edit: what I would LOVE to see is a video of the front and back of the lock as a professional safecracker cracks a safe, but there seem to be none out there on the net. 

About the safe: it must be at least 60 years old (if not older), is large, has a sargent &amp; greenleaf metal dial, had been repainted over &amp; over so it doesnt have any graphics on it... no manufacturer's marks and no possibility of the combo scribbled on it somewhere (I have checked).

Dont have a key for it. Been trying to open it for a few days. Been trying EVERYTHING! Single-pin-picking, fast raking, slow raking,scrubbing, combos of each, jiggling, changing hand positions etc etc..  Even using a snap gun and an electric pick gun .... and only managed to get it to turn just a little ways by using the snap &amp; electric gun. Which made me think it had security pins. 

Been driving me NUTS! 

Then I decided to look up how others were opening the lock on youtube... [ran across this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SADZW6U_WYY) ... and in watching it... i realized the cylinder turns the opposite way to open the lock. I have been pushing it in the wrong direction all this time.  Aint that some shit!   

So I went back to it trying the easiest way possible... using the snap and electric gun and it opened pretty quickly. Now I am going to try to do it single-pin-picking and raking.

Edit: since I made this original post 23 hours ago... I have managed to rake open, single-pin-pick it open, and ""jiggle-open"" it. The easiest way I have found to open it is a raking &amp; jiggling combo. Its the first 5 pin padlock I have ever opened. This lock is fun. Its not too easy &amp; not too hard.

Edit: 5 days later and now I can open it quite easily. Jiggling, raking and Single-pin-picking. I am thinking ablout making a video &amp; putting it on youtube. There are no security pins in this lock.. its too easy to open. 

ALso... I have been looking at other videos about this lock and  there seems to be two different versions of the herculock 800. An all brass version and a brass body with a steel shackle version.

He has no angle grinder, or lock picks. Grinding and heating the lock both would probably be inadvisable for fear of igniting the tank of gas.

My friend does not have lock picks, and could not feasibly pick the lock every time he went to fill his tank.

It seems that if he were to try pounding out the plug of the lock with a small wedge and sledgehammer, it may shear off the key pins, and the rest of the pin stack would fall right out. However, it seems this would probably require an unfeasible amount of force, and if it were unsuccessful, would render the lock too damaged to operate, making any other solution ineffective.

I'm getting pretty good at opening most padlocks with no security pins or just one. I've even managed to open a brinks high-security padlock with 4 security pins a half dozen times or so.

But I'm still struggling with two things and I was hoping I might get some pointers from you guys.


**Problem 1)** Raking. I understand it conceptually. I've seen videos. But even on the easiest locks I've never been able to just rake open the lock using ***JUST raking.***  Even when I feel I did it well I have to go in with a medium hook and finish it off. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Are the youtube videos misleading and open a no-security-pin lock not a common thing? As far as I understand it you put the rake in all the way back, put the tension wrench in and apply slight tension, then rake back and forth, applying ever-more pressure upward? Doesn't this result in over-set pins? Can anyone link to a GOOD video demonstrating technique? I've already waded through too many videos of people showing off their skills but providing not instruction.

**Problem 2)** Masterlock #3. Bear with me. Everyone seems to agree that they're really easy -- and they are. I can usually jiggle a half diamond pick from back to front and get it open. But it infuriates me that I can't single-pick it open with a medium hook! All the pins seem to be so mushy and the cylinder itself has so much play that I can *never* tell when a pin gets set! This is one case where I hope I'm missing something and one of you gents has some advice. The keyway seems rather short. Should I be using a slim/euro pick? I have the Southord 22 piece kit and it doesn't have any thin-shifted picks.

**One last question:** Schuyler Towne, whom I incidently have a serious case of hero-worship for, seems to be very fond of the 'DeForest Diamond.' Hopefully someyear I'll get my own directly from Schuyler. Until then does anyone know where I could purchase one?

I'd have to pay 30 bucks for them to change it for me and I am not allow to do it myself. For that part, I just bought the lock from homedepot for 10 bucks and just learning how to pick lock so I could open and change it. should be simple enough. 

As for the apartment key, She's asking for 180 for a crappy lock that would cost $25 to get a new dead bolt and it would cost me maybe 15 to have it rekeyed. I can not change it myself because it has to fit the master key as well and I can get in trouble if they want to get in my apartment but can't open my door. I can not get the master key off her to rekey it. I just spent close to $400 replacing my cell phone and other stuff there are still things that I need to replace. I just can't afford $180 and I feel like I am being extorted by my super for something that'd cost them at most $20 to have the cylander rekeyed they are charging me 9 times the price. out of principle I refuse to pay that. 

I have been looking at a lot of videos on line learning about rekeying locks. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems like if you could take the lock apart and very carefully look at each pin and figure out the placement of the shear lines and compare in relationship to the key I have I could figure out the master key and re key my lock with out needing the master key?

Anyways I am having a HELL of a time getting them open. I have tried everything.... raking, SPPing, even used electric and manual pick guns and nothing. 

Making me wonder if they have security pins. Note: I have several herculock 800s that I have gotten open... some were easy, some were harder, but I got them all open one way or another.

Questions: 

**how can you tell which way a lock is supposed to turn to open?** From what I have found... herculocks can turn one specific way to open. Some turn counterclockwise, while others turn clockwise.  I have used raking and manual-snap-gun turning both directions on the 700s. They both behave differently. When I rake one while turning clockwise, then let off on the tension.... I can hear the pins falling. It doesnt do that when I rake and turn the other direction and let off on the tension... so i assume the direction I am turning when the pins loudly fall is the correct way the lock turns to open it? Correct?

**What is happening when I push a single pin up til it binds and then I release tension.... and I hear two clicks as the pin falls?** Shouldnt it be one click? Is that the work of a security pin? This happens on one of my 700s. The front pin does this. 

Edit made an hour after originally posted: I just SPP'ed the one with the front pin (I mentioned in the second question) opened. I wish I knew what I did right. also... it turns clockwise like I thought (different from the 800 herculocks).
