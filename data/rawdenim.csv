Photos and thoughts~,145,18,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1bt4tb/okay_lets_do_this_nf_weird_guy_super_heavyweight/,"the pictures are at the bottom if you don't feel like reading my nonsense

Naked &amp; Famous's [32 oz. jeans](http://www.nakedandfamousdenim.com/blog/32oz-heaviest-jeans-in-the-world/).  If you felt like dropping half a grand on something ridiculous, these were a good choice: stupidly, comically thick denim that will make you walk like a moron for about a month, wincing at your bruised, blistered hips.  They are labelled ""[guaranteed uncomfortable](http://i.imgur.com/MkMp5Mc.jpg),"" and they're not kidding.

They're incredibly warm, which was nice during the chilly winter and will be horrible this summer, and I'm pleased to say that the construction has been solid so far.  They were an unbelievable pain to get into and out of at first but have relaxed to some extent.  Er...[not much, though](http://i.imgur.com/Wxe4GkR.jpg).  I wear a belt with them because I like the way belts look, not out of necessity.  These will not fall off of you.  They *can't*.

I didn't measure them before or right after I soaked them, which is kind of a shame.  Just didn't think to.  At present, the measurements of note are waist 32"", inseam 32"", thigh about 23"", maybe 23.25"", and rise 9.75"".  At a guess I'd say the postsoak measurement on the waist was probably about 30.5"", so these have some give.  I ordinarily like a 29 in the WG cut, which is numerically one below what I buy in most other jeans, so per recommendation I went with a 30.  This was the correct decision.

The reason that I hadn't bothered posting anything about them to date is that there wasn't much to show.  I'm a desklord.  A good chunk of my day is spent in front of a computer doing computer things in the office.  I walk a few miles a day and two or three times a month hop around at a show.  I've been wearing them since September 14, 2012, and there just hasn't been a huge amount of physical activity done in them.  I'm anticipating more outdoors time now that it's warming up, though...I'll be doing quite a bit of yardwork helping my dad out, doing some home improvement stuff, and so on.  Also the summers in this area are fucking miserable so even if I weren't *doing* much 100° humid weather will likely cause some more change.

Where are they at now, though?

Well, they look like this.

Their current appearance is the end result of near-daily wear from 9/14/12 to now.  They got rained on a bit once but otherwise have stayed away from much moisture.  I'm planning on taking them to the one-calendar-year mark and washing them then.  There aren't any signs of weakening fabric yet so I think they'll probably be okay.

The response was crazy encouraging and I've been working on the jeans full time since then.  I've finalized my topstitching details and added some repro details.  All the jeans now have raised belt loops, hidden rivets and raised topstitching on the rear pockets, all of which should create a nice layer of dimension on the fading. They still take a day and a half to make because I only have three machines

1369232309.0,76,self.rawdenim,1eu2bt,A guide to buying Japanese clothes through Rakuten,80,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1eu2bt/a_guide_to_buying_japanese_clothes_through_rakuten/,"###Rakuten jeans buying guide

I’ve seen some interest in buying jeans and other items direct from Japan, so I decided to write this up, having just gone through it. Although it is possible to buy direct from retailers via a proxy, Rakuten makes it a hell of a lot easier and you don't have to pay any proxy fees, so that’s what I’ll write about.

###Why buy from Japan?
  
* The Yen is weak relative to the dollar right now. For example, a pair of $350 Japanese jeans can be bought for ~$250 direct from Japan.
 
* As many of you know, Levi’s sued the Japanese manufacturers for trademark infringement regarding the famous Levi’s arcs and tabs. As a consequence, U.S. retailers aren’t allowed to sell jeans with the tab or arcs that are too similar to Levi’s. *Side note: Because I don’t want to discourage people from buying from GREAT US retailers, you should know that this isn’t always the case- do your research!*

* Some Japanese brands aren’t sold in the US. If you want something more obscure, sometimes you have to get it direct from Japan

###Why not buy from Japan?

  * The savings may be illusionary. For one, international shipping is ~$20-30, though some retailers offer free shipping. More importantly, buying direct is a gamble. You *might* get slapped with import duties, which can eat up most of the $$ you saved. I went back and forth with another Redditor while making this purchase, and he indicated that he got hit with a bill for ~$70 for his jeans. Suddenly, between shipping and duties, you save nothing.

  * You should support the awesome community of retailers who bring quality Japanese shit to us. Self Edge and Blue in Green are awesome stores with very helpful owners. Although I doubt that many of the cult brands will ever really become popular enough to be “common” in the US, putting your $$ into these small businesses helps the community grow. I would have bought the jeans I just purchased from BiG, but they’ve been out of my size for more than 6 months.

###What is Rakuten?
Rakuten is Japan’s largest e-commerce site, which sells all sorts of shit directly (I think) and also through 3rd party retailers (think Amazon). Rakuten just purchased Buy.com, which as far as I can tell, is exactly the same as Buy.com used to be. 

So, there are three Rakuten sites:

  * [Japanese Rakuten](http://Rakuten.co.jp) This is not what you want

  * [Buy.com Rakuten](http://www.Rakuten.com) This is also not what you want; you won’t find any Japanese clothes on here

  * [Global Rakuten](http://global.rakuten.com/en) This is the site you are looking for. All the Japanese is (poorly) translated into English, prices are in U.S. dollars, shipping defaults to international, etc.

Rakuten offers a “points reward” system, much like your credit card. I can’t imagine ordering enough stuff from this site to get any meaningful reward, but I suppose you should sign up anyways.

###Merchants to look for
For buying Japanese raw denim, a few merchants are commonly mentioned: [2nd](http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/2nd/), [And-Japan](http://www.rakuten.co.jp/and-japan) (a little tricker since the web store links to the Japanese Rakuten site), and [Kaizoku Pirates] (http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/pirates/). As far as I know, nobody at 2nd speaks English, the people at Kaizoku do, and I have no idea about And. There are plenty of other retailers selling raw denim, I'm just not familiar with them. I'm sure they are legit.

###Buying from Rakuten

Buying from Rakuten is just like buying from any other e-commerce site, with a few exceptions. When you buy an item, you will receive confirmation of your purchase from Rakuten, followed by communication with the specific retailer you purchased from. From that point on, you communicate directly with the retailer until the item is paid for and shipped, at which point you will again hear from Rakuten. So, it is a bit different than, say, Amazon, where no communication between yourself and the 3rd party occurs. There are a few things to think about:

  * Rakuten does not include shipping at the time of checkout: once you’ve completed the checkout process, the merchant will email you a final quote, with shipping costs included. I assume at this point, if you don't agree with the cost, you can cancel the purchase.

  * If buying from 2nd, you are required to make your first payment through Paypal. So, even if you put in your credit card information, they will send you a Paypal link to complete the payment. Don’t worry, you won’t be charged double.

  * Although the return policy probably varies from store to store, I wouldn’t bet on returning anything you order, especially if it’s from a non-English speaking retailer. The whole process seems like it would just suck, so if you don’t like your purchase, I’d throw it on eBay.

Also, there is a place to put in requests to the retailer while you are checking out, so you have an opportunity to communicate a few things. Things you should think about:

  * Pre-wash or no wash. I know that Kaizoku will do the first wash for your jeans before sending (2nd does not), so if you don’t want that, make sure you let them know. 

  * Hemming, if you desire. Most of these shops offer a complementary hem- 2nd does for sure.

  * Ask them if they will mark your package as a gift, with a low value. This may help you avoid the big duty payments, and most of the retailers will go along with it.

###Communicating with sellers

If the seller speaks English, this is easy. If not, you will have to communicate using a translator. It’s easier than it sounds. At first, I wasn’t able to figure out what the hell was going on, but over time I got the hang of it. Just try to get the general idea of the email, and don’t worry about the details. If you can’t figure it out, members on this board (shout out to u/jawnzer for the advice) and [Superdenim](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/forum/22-superdenim/) are helpful. Superdenim will have Japanese speakers willing to translate for you if you ask. 

This is an example of an email you might get:

&gt;こんにちは！
&gt;いつもお世話になっております。2ND(セカンド)です。
&gt;お振込みをありがとうございました！
&gt;入金確認をさせていただきましたので
&gt;ご連絡をさせていただきます。
&gt;それでは準備が出来次第、発送させていただきます。

&gt;これからも親切、迅速、丁寧をモットーとして
&gt;努力をさせていただきますので、
&gt;今後とも2ND(セカンド)をどうぞよろしくお願いします。

And the translation is:

&gt;I have always taken care of. 2ND is the (second).
&gt;Thank you for your payment!
&gt;Since we have a confirmation of payment
&gt;I will contact you.

So, although it doesn’t make complete sense, you get the point.
Reply to them using very simple English, and then enter it into a translator and paste in the Japanese. For example:


&gt;Please do not wash. Please mark as gift with low value.

###Final words

That’s really all there is to it. I ordered [my jeans](http://i.imgur.com/FO7g5nU.jpg) on Thursday, May 16. They were shipped Saturday, May 19 and arrived yesterday, May 21. That’s faster than most U.S. retailers. However, I have heard horror stories about items being stuck in customs for 10 days-2 weeks. So, some of it is luck, I guess. 

Hope the guide is useful to some of you. You can get some really neat stuff from Japan for a pretty good price, and the process is a lot easier than you might think. However, there are risks involved, and the possibility to return things is pretty limited. Overall, I will continue to look at US retailers first, but for things I can’t find locally, shopping through Japan is a great alternative. If there is anything else you'd like to see in this guide, please reply or PM me.

Not hemmed obviously.

Colour is dark indigo with typical Nudie orange tonal stitching. The Nudie swirl on the back pockets is bright white.

I don't want any money for them, I want to give them to a kid in school, be it high school or college. I'd prefer someone that is into denim but can't afford a new pair all the time, so if you're doing ok give another kid a chance :)

I'll be online again tonight so I'll check back then.

Oh, I'm located in Paris, so someone within Europe would be preferred (postage is a bitch)...but I'll check how much shipping to the US / Canada would be.

Cheerio!

EDIT - Shit, just came home from a Pho run with my girl, this really blew up. Now I feel bad that I have to choose. At this point they're taken. I've got 2-3 candidates, I just need to check out postage costs and whatnot. I'll PM the ones that might get them. Right now I'm digging through my closet to find more, I have a Cheap Monday in 34 somewhere, brand new, some slim fit model...I'll see what else there is.

When I created this subreddit I truly did not anticipate the sort of interest and suppor that has begun to take form here. With the popularity of SuFu and other forums of raw denim discussion dominating the internet, I was doubtful this page would ever gain more than a few hundred subs. When I last made a post of significance it was around the end of spring semester, where there were roughly a few hundred subscribers, and we now sit at nearly 1500! 

Unfortunately the last few months have been incredible busy and challenging for me, and i failed to recognize the need to follow up on taking the moderation duties seriously on this page. Once again, it is no excuse for never following up on finding mods to take the reigns on this page. While I realize the past few months have been frustrating, I propose the following actions to be taken:

1. I have extended an offer for MightyDerek and gravyfish to join me as mods, and start to build a blueprint for where this subreddit should go. Hopefully this post can be a good place to get all of your input.

2. Establish who else can be added as moderators. There was a post a while back from someone who offered an incredible design and layout for the page, with a line of selvedge running across the top. If you can make yourself known in this post, and let us know if you are still interested in being involved please do so.

3. Start assembling a sidebar, links, sister subreddits, and some weekly or daily posts (fadefridays, WAYWT, etc). If you guys have any ideas please chime in. One of the favorite things i saw happen on SuFu was a jeans tour in which Naked&amp;Famous supplied a free pair of jeans to be sent around to a select few members of the community and they were all able to wear them for a few months and sign them. The owner of the company is a friend of a friend, so if this is something that interests you guys i will see what can be done.

**Let's keep it organized!**

Top level comments are of the form *""City, State/Province, Country""* or just *""City, Country""* if your country doesn't do the state/province thang. Examples: *""San Francisco, CA, USA""* or *""Berlin, Germany""*

Second level comments include only the name of the store, as a link to the store's website if possible. Example: *""Self Edge""*.

Third level comments can include anything like your experience with the store's customer service, brands that the store stocks, how often they have sales, etc.

I bought these in early February. I remember getting a package at my door in the morning. I was on my way to school and I was late so I decided to take the package with me rather than take it back inside. I stuffed the package into my backpack and opened it during 5th period. They were my jeans. They felt heavy and very nice. It was a dark indigo color that i fell in love with. Maybe it was because the pants i was wearing at the time were too tight or because i was in love with my new jeans (or even both) that I skipped lunch to put on my jeans. I [changed in the bathroom](http://distilleryimage8.s3.amazonaws.com/57d5602e810c11e2aacd22000a1f932c_7.jpg) and it was really uncomfortable. I spent a couple minutes trying to pull the waistband up so it would fit. I couldn't even button any buttons. I walked to class in the most uncomfortable jeans i've ever worn. My thighs hurt a lot. 

Mom picked me up that day and we went to a festival. Lots more walking. By the end of the day, my jeans weren't as painful.

I'm one of the co-owners of [3sixteen](http://www.3sixteen.com) and would love to sponsor one featuring a pair of our jeans and one of our heavyweight belts. I'm not sure if we'd need Mod approval to make this an official World Tour for the subreddit, but hopefully we can add it to the sidebar where people can post continual updates as they wear the jeans and pass them on.


For those who are unfamiliar with a World Tour, it works like this: we settle on a cut and a size, and have a number of readers sign up to participate that would fit into the jean. I send the jean and belt out to the first wearer who will wear them each day for 1-2 months; during this time, he'll post updates on the jeans and what and he's experiencing in them. At the end of his period, he'll give them a cold wash, sign the pocketbag, and mail them to the next participant. This can go on for a year ideally, but if we have more willing participants we can look at extending it further. At the end, we'll have a very nicely worn-in pair of 3sixteen jeans that each of the participants will have contributed to. Here's a link to the famous Flat Head 3001 World Tour thread on Superfuture:


http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/topic/28621-the-flat-head-3001-world-tour/


If you're interested, please reply below with your waist size and your location (as well as any travels you might have planned for the upcoming year). We'll see what waist size(s) might work best for the majority of the participants and go from there. 

**UPDATE: It looks like we'll be going with a ST-120x (Slim Tapered Shadow Selvedge) in size 32, as that's the most popular waist size from all your responses. Please see the list of potential participants I've compiled below - if you're still interested, please message me with your email address so I can start an email chain for all participants to discuss the world tour further. I'll create a new thread once all details are finalized so everyone can follow along. Thanks again for all your interest!**

Some quick updates on what we've been doing– (other than finals. Fuck finals.)

- We decided as a mod team to take a firmly anti-adspam position.  As such, we're going to be super trigger happy with the remove button on anything that we think benefits the poster more than the general population.  Definitely still link to great sales and commercial announcements- just don't do it if you're the business/blog in question. If something gets removed and you disagree, feel free to message us and if we're in the wrong, I'll personally post fit pics of my new 23 oz raw denim briefs. 

- We've had some great ideas spring up from you guys about new info you want in the FAQ/sidebar, including info on leather products, fade pics, and even making your own jeans.  A belts guide is up, we'll work on the fade pics, but the other one will require some assistance from you guys, as we don't know anything about it.

- Jumping off that– want something added to the sub?  Write it!  We can't know everything.  We'd love to include it.

- There's now a weekly General Discussion thread, which is pretty fun in my opinion.

Since I work in a business casual setting, I don’t get the opportunity to wear my raw denim every day - which is unfortunate because I don't really get the fades in the timing that I'd like, but I'll be patient. That being said, I *love* raw denim. I truly appreciate the aspect of having denim that you wear with you on life’s journey and they ultimately acquire their own unique markings and fades.

###[3sixteen ST-100x](http://imgur.com/a/9yW8X)

##Pros
As with nearly all 3sixteen denim, you know you’re going to be getting your money worth (assuming you’re into raw denim). Due to the weight of this denim, it feels incredibly substantial. The break-in time was not that bad at all. They were a little tight but not unbearable for the first few wears and as I increased the amount that I wore them, they started to become more and more comfortable. The one thing that I think is a benefit of 3sixteens is that they stretch, but NOT too much. They’ve stretched just enough to be comfortable but not enough that they lose their shape and no longer fit.

You can tell the construction on these is done with the intent on having them last for a long time. Although I’ve never owned a pair of APCs, I’ve read countless times that the construction of 3sixteens denim is significantly better than that of the declining APC. Granted, you will also be paying for that with the 3sixteens ($220 vs. $185).

The hardware and all the “little” things on the 3sixteen are fantastic. The buttons are all custom branded and the leather patch on the back (which is from Tanner) looks great. Everything about these denim feels substantial and solid.

Since I’m 6’10”, the 37” inseam is a huge selling point. In most pants, I usually wear a size 34 or 35. I opted for the 34 since I knew they were going to stretch *a little* after wearing them in. 

Overall, 3sixteen has a very solid lineup and seem to be sticking with the ""essentials"". They aren't release products left and right, but that is okay because what they *do* offer is consistency and quality.

##Cons
I’ve experienced a little bit of fraying in a few areas but it isn’t anything I didn’t expect for something that is crafted individually and not mass produced. I’m not worried about the fraying leading to anything more serious. To me, it just adds a little more quality.

###[Taylor Stitch Tailored Denim](http://imgur.com/a/5JiuP)
---

##Pros
Taylor Stitch offers a fairly decent pair of denim at a reasonable price. I won’t say that they are even *close* to being a favorite for any of my denim, but they’re great as a beater pair. I wore these camping last weekend and had no remorse and they held up great. I did some rock climbing and hiking and had no issues.

I really like the red selvedge accents. I know communities are pretty split over the colored accents depending on your style, but I enjoy them.

Taylor Stitch is getting into a little bit of everything. They have a lot of shorts, chinos, shirts, tees, and they all seem *pretty* good overall for their quality. I wouldn't put it nearly on par with Rogue Territory or 3sixteen. They have been releasing new products every week which is pretty cool -- and they're involved in a lot of collaborations.

##Cons
As mentioned before, the overall feel and quality of these don't feel as substantial as 3sixteen or Rogue Territory. That isn't to say they aren't better than 90% of the jeans on the market, but the others just rock it in this department.

Although this is a con for me, it could be a pro for others (depending on your body type). Taylor Stitch’s construction is great -- they just happen to have a more, as they put it, “democratic” fit. They’re a little bigger in the legs and seat which is one of the reasons they began creating denim, for bigger guys. I wouldn't purchase from Taylor Stitch in the future, but I think they offer decent denim for the ""bigger guy"" demographic and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for that group.

###[Rogue Territory RK Grey Caste](http://imgur.com/a/BJ4WU)
---

##Pros
The craftsmanship is definitely evident in these jeans. Rogue Territory takes some pretty standard cuts and adds their own subtle but appreciated additions or changes. Unlike most raw denim, you can actually put things in these front pockets and access them -- even when sitting down (which I can’t do with my Left Field). The pockets are unique and are by no means standard issue, but I think that is one of the qualities that make this a great pair of denim for me. The pockets have sort of the “trouser” feel so I feel comfortable wearing them in the business casual setting at work.

The fit on these is fantastic -- the RK have the right amount of taper without being too aggressive. These will remain in my arsenal for a long time because I consider the cut to be a little more timeless. They aren’t so skinny that I’ll look odd in a few years if that “trend” goes away but they still actually show the contour of my legs.

They utilize a split cut selvedge (which was one of the signature additions on the [Lee 101Z](https://www.google.com/search?q=lee+101z&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=s1i_UcisJMTYyQHY64CoBg&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=935&amp;sei=5Fi_UZqUNJD_rAGzrIGgDQ)). The reasoning behind this is that, “...with split selvedge the self-edge of the denim is present on the front panel and back the panel shows an overlock stitch. By doing a ‘split cut’ you are using more of the denim per pant, in doing so it also minimizes wasted denim during the manufacturing process.” I really like the split cut selvedge because I think it is a unique addition over what is usually offered in the raw denim world. You can tell RT are definitely trying to mix it up.

The details and hardware on these denim is fantastic. I’m pretty partial to the Rogue Territory logo so I fully appreciate the custom button hardware and the branded leather patch on the back. The loops feel solidly sewn in which is helpful if you plan to be a little more active with these.

Since this is a 10 oz denim, they feel a lot lighter and can easily be worn in the summer while still staying cool.

I like the subtle sewn accents on the back pocket since I'm not a fan of big, gaudy designs. These are a great pair of timeless, classic jeans and as I said before, they'll be in my arsenal for a long time. I would definitely like to explore some of Rogue Territory's more recent additions. Over the last year or so, they've been releasing a lot of new products (awesome shorts, jackets, denim, pants).

##Cons
They are *slightly* loose fitting in the seat, but I think that is mainly an issue with my sizing (I probably should have gone down to 33). Although I am a fan of the pockets, my wife isn’t -- but it is definitely all personal preference. Other than that, there really isn't anything I don't like about these jeans.

Here are my jeans, which I purchased brand new from APC a little over three years ago.  The first year I had them I wore them a good 5-6 days a week.  Since that first year the number of weekly wears has tapered off as I discovered other jeans to wear.  They have been washed about 6 times so far.  I know APCs are very common but I wanted to share anyways.  

The wear on the bottom hem is from walking without shoes often.  Also I thought the fade outlining the selvage was interesting.  That can be seen on the left leg of the back picture.

So with that, I wanted to get some ideas going about how we could structure this contest to make it interactive, and get people participating throughout the duration. I am going to take a few things from the HWDC as they have it quite down pat, but want it to be for the /r/rawdenim community. 

I'll write out a list of things I think would be good for the contest, and just expand on them, or add to it as you see fit!

* Bi monthly challenges  that everyone has to submit to, whether it be the day after the contest was announced, or the last day, doesn't matter.
* Weekly discussion thread solely dedicated to this (if anyone can get ahold of lobster)
* Monthly check in for updates, fit pics. (Everyone has to take part in this, guarantees people are staying active at least ONCE a month)
* A meet up at some point throughout the competition, in Seattle at the Blue Owl shop (all circumstantial in many ways, if enough people can make it, if Jay is interested in this, etc etc)
* Also, we could get a order of ebbets field caps together. I have heard some people saying they'd like to do one with the /r/rawdenim community, and this is the perfect time. Once we get everything settled, and rolling this is something we could pursue further and discuss out options.

If there is anything else that seems like it would be a good fit for this list, please post below. Or even if you think my ideas suck, and want to tweak it a bit.

We'll leave the design of the patch, and the distribution to the people at 3sixteen and Blue Owl. They have seen our ideas now, and have a general idea which way we were swinging.

i know that many, if not most, subscribers to r/rawdenim came from MFA due to the ubiquitous recommendation of slim tapered raw jeans. however, denim culture is so much more than just fit. sometimes i think of denimheads like i think of people who are really into watches- it's about construction, heritage, and details just as much as aesthetics. the way the rest of the world sees the item is one small part of what makes it desirable. many people get into raws to find the best looking jeans, and there's nothing wrong with that. asking for a fit check is fine, and giving fit advice is fine. however, let's all keep in mind that, especially in denim culture, not everybody is seeking a slim tapered look, or any ""fashionable"" look at all. 

basically, what i am trying to say is that i am hoping r/rawdenim will not be just an offshoot of MFA where people go to get praised or critiqued on their jeans based on the way they fit from the knee down. it's *really cool* to see some other aspects of denim culture find their way to this board. i am hoping we can encourage, rather than discourage, that. i know that the tender co. thread was *mostly* positive, but there were some real nasty comments in there. 

for anybody who is interested, i recommend [superdenim](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/forum/22-superdenim/) and [denimhunters](http://denimhunters.com/) for places to discuss/experience denim culture. also, i really wanted to post this in a GD thread, but AFAIK they're only on mondays. how about twice a week?",,False,,t5_2scl9,1374155882.0,,,True,t3_1ik47u,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ik47u/rrawdenim_are_we_the_denim_wing_of_mfa/,

1370119315.0,36,self.rawdenim,1fhcql,Indigoskin Lunar 001. 7-8 months of wear. One wash.,39,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1fhcql/indigoskin_lunar_001_78_months_of_wear_one_wash/,"I started wearing these on February 14, 2012, and they were my dailies until September 14.  Since then they've been worn off and on when I want to wear my boots, since the Weird Guy cut doesn't mesh too well with them, or, like today, just for the hell of it.  Pictures are at the bottom if you're in a rush.

They started out looking like [this](http://www.indigoskinjeans.com/blogs/blog1.php/2011/01/14/indigoskin-lunar-limited-editionr-available-for-pre-order): deep, deep dark, with a very noticeable sheen.  I don't *think* they're available anymore, but it took a while for them to sell out.  Indigo warp, black weft.  They're loud, by the standards of this sub.  Not like...Evisu full-leg gulls busy, but there's a lot going on.  Tri-color stitching, very shiny buttons, gold selvedge, and a big back-left pocket design are why they caught my attention to begin with.  The cut is relatively high-rise at 11 inches in the size 30, with the waist on mine measuring about 31"" after some wear, and the top block fits fairly snug.  I don't have my tape measure on me right now so [here's a link to the Sky edition measurement table](http://www.craftharbour.com/products/107-sky-001-straight-tapered-fit.aspx), which I'm pretty sure is the same cut.   Whatever shrinkage occurred during the wash--which for me means putting the pants in the tub, swishing them around a bit, and then walking away for maybe an hour--was incredibly minor.

My main resource was [this sufu article](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/25260-denim-shops-in-tokyo/) and I would recommend others to use it if they are going an a similar adventure.

After some ramen, confusion, and several visits to the fitting room later(see album below), I settled on a pair of Japan Blue 0701s (specific details on there website [here](http://www.japanblue.co.jp/jbjeans/JB0201USA.html)) and absolutely love them.  I had never heard of this brand at time of purchasing (thank you /u/michael_is_awesome for his post a few days ago, with much better pics than me, just as further confirmation that I bought a good pair) and actually kind of like the fact that I can feel like I'm wearing something more unique. 

 At the end of the day, it was a very cool experience, and I ended up with a pair of jeans that make me happy every time I wear them.  I will be sure to keep you guys updated as more wear begins to show.  Feel free to ask me anything about my experiences; enjoy the photos!

The answer is wash your denim. yes back in the day cowboys and such went many days before their denim washed and as a result their denim  faded extremely well yet fell apart too. in the 50's in levis prime households across america washed their denim every week and hung them up to dry. and yes their denim developed beautiful fade patters. now it seems some people have a misunderstanding of why it is necessary to wash your jeans. On one hand people crave sick fades but cry when they develop a hole in the crotch. the solution is simple wash your denim. it really just bothers me that people avoid all but the simplest solution for most denim problems. this wasnt intended to be a rant but maybe next time you think about posting about a hole or smell or stain consider what people have done for ages and throw those puppies in the washing machine,,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_18pn24,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/18pn24/why_the_hate_against_washing/,

* Why do people want such heavy jeans? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gowjk/unbranded_21oz_skinny_fit_100_wears_one_wash/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gocqj/new_gustin_indigoindigo_and_heavy_japan/)

* How exactly does the selvedge make it on to the jeans? According to [this](http://www.rawrdenim.com/2012/08/raw-denim-myths-the-truth-about-selvedge-denim/) site, the selvedge gets woven on to the edge of the fabric by a particular type of loom. Denim from the loom is like a giant roll of foil. From what I think happens next, that roll gets unrolled and stencils are used to cut out pieces of fabric. I can't imagine each stencil goes from one edge of the roll to the other edge, most is obviously going to come from the center where no selvedge was woven. So when the denim is cut, a new edge is formed, do makers have another loom which re-adds the selvedge?

* Why is unsanforized in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajtuzv) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajoyxp).

* Why is tapered in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajm0v5) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajp77i)

* Why is slubbiness in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajp77i) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1616d2/what_brands_are_known_for_their_slubby_denim/).

* What do you wear when it rains/snows?

* How tight is the crotch on ""properly"" fitted jeans? My new gustins fit exactly to my waist size, nice around the ass, great around the legs (minus the length, way too long), but are giving me a bit of a camel toe with my balls. I feel like I could post on /r/datgap

* Does anyone have any empirical evidence on what causes crotch blowouts? Is it because of lack of washings or rubbing? I've worn ""mainstream"" jeans for upwards of five years and I've washed them almost after every wear and never experienced a crotch blowout. 

* Why are strange wefts in demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12eg3v/red_weft/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1692q5/thinking_about_getting_a_pair_with_indigo_warp/).

Over the last couple weeks I have found out that there are a bunch of community members living in the bay area such as

* Me

* /u/talzer

* /u/dorksquad

* /u/onox37

* a couple other people I talked to a little while back whose usernames I forget (sorry!)

Everyone has responded positively to the idea of having a meet up, so I figured I would organize one!

/u/talzer and I have tentatively set aside the afternoon of **Saturday, February 16th**. If that doesn't work for other people, post in the comments and we can schedule a time that works best for all of us.

I don't know anyone's age, but I think it would be best to keep the meetup activities under 21 acceptable so that we can include everyone. I was thinking we could grab some grub in the Mission, then walk over to Self Edge and Union Made after that. If anyone has any other (or better) ideas please share!

This past weekend I got a pair of 3sixteen SL-120's from Self Edge LA and they are amazing.
  

 If anyone new is reading I want to say this as clearly as I can: if you have a question it has already been asked and answered multiple times so look it up. You guys not only were great for giving me the lay of the denim land, but also in pointing out things to look for in good vs. bad denim. I worked hard to save up the money for these bad boys (read working saturday school detention at a high school) so having extensive walkthroughs is great. 

I also want to thank the people at Self Edge and 3sixteen, in particular /u/johan3sixteen who answered questions in the shop then hemmed and shipped them to me in just a few days. This is my first pair of raw denim but certainly not my last, I can now really see why some of you guys have closets full of em.

As you can see they're a bit snug up top but that's all good since they'll stretch out like my Big Slubs did. Expect even more room up top since there seems to be a little more fabric than the slubs have.

Going to be letting these pants stack more once they're tailored so I'm getting the leg tapered in more to compensate. Also getting a chain stitch as usual.

Big Slubs I had tapered and hemmed awhile ago.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Picked these up December 2011. Seemed like a good intro to the raw world.

I didn't get to wear them as much as I would've liked. Pretty much rarely ever worn during the work week, maybe a night or two every now and then for a couple hours. Worn a lot on the weekends, but not every day. 

I didn't do anything special or crazy. Broke them in by just wearing them around and being a little uncomfortable for a little while. Any stains or spills I just wiped up with a little water if necessary. They never smelled or got gross which was nice.

They are a little heavy for wearing in the summer when it gets hot. Luckily it doesn't get to hot in western Washington so that wasn't too much of a problem. Its great for fall/winter and the general cool climate. 

Fit deets if you care; these are a 31 and my actual waist is 31"".

Pics taken in natural light, no editing.

I'm not claiming to have any sick fadez. I feel like these are a good example of into-level raw denim worn buy a regular guy for a while. ",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_1crtr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1crtr1/naked_and_famous_deep_indigo_selvedgeskinny_guy/,

I tried them on around the house for half an hour, but since they're more canvas as opposed to raw denim they don't break in as much.

Here's the deal though: through a manufacturing defect a seam next to the button fly came lose. It looks like weird / weak stitching, it's definitely not torn - as you can see in the picture [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/p45NvVj.jpg).


And [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/ZCptvpK.jpg) is another shot. The lose stitching goes all the way down the small buttons...it'll cost me about €8 to get it fixed at the tailor. Since I have to drop off some dry cleaning later anyway I'll have him fix the N&amp;F's as well.

For those who don't know, here's a pretty [STOCK PICTURE](http://i.imgur.com/1qbl5pT.jpg). I think I still have the tags as well.


I just gave away a pair of Nudie's on here about a week and a half ago, paid for shipping and everything, never heard from the kid again, but I know he got them, so I hope he's happy.

Rules are the same, if you can afford them please give someone else a shot, I am thinking high school / college kids / low income family kids....you get the idea.

These ones are great for the summer as they're only 10oz I believe.


I'm located in Paris, so shipping always takes a while.


Have a good day everyone!



**EDIT - They found a new home - sorry to everyone that I couldn't get them. More to come though.**


**EDIT #2 - The guy that got my Nudies messaged me, turned out that he had some family matter to take care of, so clearly browsing Reddit is not a priority then (if it ever is....well...at work maybe :)). He sent me a very nice message and we're still chit-chatting back and forth. Please disregard any comments I made regarding ""I never heard back from the first guy."" I jumped the gun there.

Wearers are often seen as having failed, made mistakes, or wasted their time and money. I think there should be more appreciation of the amount of time people have committed to their denim with less judgment of their results beyond pure aesthetics.

*****

I think about this a lot when I see comments on here, Sufu, or a Rawr Denim Fade Friday criticizing someone's jeans' fades. This can happen on a pair that's not washed out enough, too washed out, too contrasty, not contrasty enough, too damaged or dirty, or for any other reason. But often there are people saying they're terrible and disappointing. 

I appreciate comments that focus on the aesthetic of the fades simply not appealing to that individual. But some seem to have the attitude that the wearer of the jeans failed because they didn't get good results or washed too much or washed to little, etc. It feels oddly judgmental to me. I 100% understand that hobbyists will always nitpick and of course people will have preferences. But because raw denim is such a commitment and it isn't purely about appearance, the way people look at and rate the end results doesn't seem to fit with the general attitude most people (not all) have about the hobby.

If you wear a pair of jeans every day for two years and at the end of the two years everyone on the internet says a range of ""terrible"", ""6/10"", ""meh"", etc. how do you reconcile that? You can not care, obviously, and I'm sure most don't, but it seems like there's pressure for people to get good fades or else they ""didn't do it right"". There are people who make concerted efforts to fade their jeans less or differently and they're usually respected, but someone who just wears their jeans and maintains them basically could end up with something that the entire hobby's community doesn't even like. 

It's not about getting the internet's approval or anything. Plenty of raw denim wearers don't care or even know about online denim communities. But the mindset within the people who talk about the hobby that wearing jeans is inherently a contest where results are judged and picked apart seems odd to me. It would be boring if every fade was praised no matter what, but I guess I'd like more appreciation for the commitment the wearer has made. Also I think aesthetic opinions should be separated from the idea of someone failing or not meeting a goal. ""Not the fades I like/prefer"" vs. ""This is unimpressive and unattractive"" is a big difference to me. 

A common one on Rawr Denim is that a pair looks no better than a cheap, pre-distressed one. I must be coming off like raw denim wearers are fragile and sensitive and can't take criticism, but that comment usually has an overtone of ""You wasted your money and you shouldn't be satisfied with your time commitment to these jeans"". My point isn't that people shouldn't criticize, it's that I think people are too results-centric and view results on a scale of good to bad when, for the wearer's sake and the community's, I don't know if they should be viewed like that.

I hope this leads to some good discussion since I'm not sure how I feel about it. I don't intend to criticize the community because I really do love this sub.

I think this should be enough to make our sub feel like our own, without going crazy on custom styles, especially where actual content is displayed.

After I'm done with that, I'm going to set up a script to automatically post a b/s/t thread every week so we don't have to rely on humans and their errors anymore. Big thanks to brian_g for posting the last few by hand, hopefully we won't need to do anything by hand in the near future.

No fear! If you find the idea of raw denim interesting, but can't afford spending $300+ on *one* pair of jeans, then remember it's always best to start out small. Maybe raw denim is an experiment for you.  Maybe you don't want to invest a lot of money into something you don't know if you'll love or not. Raw denim *is* an investment. You're paying for high quality, unwashed, (usually) indigo denim. If you feel like you could get into fading denim, but can't drop a bunch of money on high end brands, then this is the guide for you.

Since this *is* a beginner's guide, I might as well introduce RD. What is raw denim?
This [guide](http://www.rawrdenim.com/2011/09/the-essential-raw-denim-breakdown-our-100th-article/) does a fantastic job of explaining the gist of raws. Basically, Unwashed, high(er) quality denim. Don't wash it for a long time and you'll produce some cool fading.

&gt; *""I'm interested in raw jeans, but they're really expensive :/""*

I've always been interested in expanding on this part of the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/wiki/index) (which by the way, everyone should read, its great.)

I get it. You're on a high school/college budget, just starting your wardrobe and aren't really sure if you can spend a lot on just one pair of jeans. That's cool. Let's get you some resources on where you can cop some cheaper denim.

* **Low end** 

* [Gustin Denim](https://www.weargustin.com/store) -$70-100

* [Levi's 501 (Shrink to fit) Rigid - $50- $70](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2076855)

* [Cheap Monday](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=24221806) - $75

* [Unbranded](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=16917882&amp;parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS) (both regular and [21oz](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=26970624&amp;parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS)) $80-$100

* **Mid ''area''**

* [Naked and Famous](http://tateandyoko.com/Jeans/Naked-Famous/Skinny-Guy/Naked-Famous-Skinny-Guy-Left-Hand-Twill-Selvedge.html) - $115-$150

* Williamsburg Garment Co. Grand Street Raw Jean – $102

* A.P.C. New Standard - $185

* [Left Field NYC](http://store.leftfieldnyc.com/product/cone-mills-slim-straight-jeans) $150-175 

This is as high as i'll go since it's not really ''cheap'' anymore past that. 

One thing i would like to mention is to keep in mind that there are Buy/Sell/Trade Threads in /r/malefashion, /r/frugalmalefashion and even in this sub. You can score a pair of lightly used, even sometimes *new* denim, only tried on once, for a great deal.


* ''ok beacon i've got some money for my first raws but dont you have to size down for stretch? what about vanity sizing too idk what i should do""

/u/Size_tts is a guy you'll want to talk to. Generally, you'll want to *size True To Size* aka what you normally wear in pants. If you're not sure what size to buy, and even if you are, *check the sizing charts*. It may say that it's size 30, but that doesn't automatically mean you'll get a 30 waist. A good example of this is [N&amp;F Weird guys. ](
http://tateandyoko.com/Naked-Famous-Weird-Guy-Left-Hand-Twill-Selvedge.html). See how the TAG SIZE says *28* but the WAIST is *30*? You've got to read the sizing charts to see what you're gonna get.

That was just one example. If you can't get to a sizing chart, then take a look at the [sizing guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apb2msALGA07dHU1XzFkUFRNeXBNX0VmYWlmcDJ5LVE#gid=0) by users here at /r/Rawdenim! If you're still not sure, ask about it in a Simple Questions thread on /r/malefashionadvice or here in general discussion.


* ok i paid for my jeans and i got em what do i do?

this is where raw denim is kinda different. some people say to just wear the jeans. others say to soak em so they fit. Personally, I say just to wear your jeans. You shouldn't need to soak your jeans unless they are unsanforized. If they are, then they will shrink with a soak.

* thanks but what happens if i get them dirty before the 6 months mark

Have some common sense. If you got [shit on your jeans](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/165kfc/i_shit_my_raw_denim_jeanshow_do_i_wash_them/) then don't walk around with a big stain on your jeans, claiming it's 'setting in' or 'getting them shit faydz'. Wash your jeans when they get dirty. Nothing's wrong with a couple months of just wearing but once you start getting substances like mud and dirt all over your jeans, it's time for a wash.

* What can I wear with my raws?

This is a question that's well suited for /r/malefashionadvice but w/e. Wear some suede chukkas or some low white sneakers so the indigo rubs off nicely. Maybe even let it get on your expensive leather boots. Wear a natural colored, vegetable tanned leather belt so it gets a patina and develops a color along with your jeans fading. The belt will also grab some indigo.",,False,,t5_2scl9,1368828639.0,,,True,t3_1ehu7g,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ehu7g/raw_denim_for_beginners_a_guide/,

When I first came across Raw Denim (through r/rawdenim and other blogs) I wasn't nearly impressed. I was never much into fades, or rather I didn't understand them from my limited experience of washed jeans.

Browsing around for few weeks, I bought my first pair of raws; N&amp;F WG LHT. I got them in mail and was in for a surprise when I touched them. They were nothing like other jeans I had previously, they were as stiff as cardboard(I remembered reading about that in a lot of posts). I couldn't even fit into them, had a hard time to button up. So I thought maybe they are not for me. But I didn't return them as well. 

Fast forward to a month, I lost some weight and tried them on again. This time I was able to fit in quite well, so I decided to try them on for few days and see what the fuss was all about. And literally within two wears I fell in love with them. 

After wearing them for about couple of months now, I can safely say that I am now able to appreciate the love for Raw Denim. I am having a hard time adjusting to other pair of jeans and I am on the constant lookout for new pair of raws. I am not planning to go crazy and start buying $300 pair of jeans yet but I am slowly expanding with UB201.

I much appreciate the information on r/rawdenim and more importantly this sub-reddit feels much more intimate and less rigid than others *cough* r/mfa

From looking at the sidebar the links to the different brands seem good, but does anybody else think it would be a good idea to have short guides on each brand? 

For example for APC you could have a guide explaining how the New Standard, Petit Standard, New Cures, etc. fit, and compare them to other well known fits from other brands. You could also say how much to size down, how much you should expect them to stretch, pros and cons of the brand and so on. 

A lot of this you can find out through googling but it seems like these guides would be helpful for both beginners and people who are venturing into new brands and want to have a feel for what to expect.",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_18slks,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/18slks/suggestion_short_guides_in_the_sidebar_on_each/,

I've bought a couple of great pieces of denim over the years (flat heads, PBJs, etc...) but nothing has ever made me happier than my APC's.  You just can not beat the price + quality + fade over time. OK, quality can be sketch at times.

If anyone wonders why i sized up, it is mainly because i've been working out a bit and my quads be getting big :P

1351700617.0,24,self.rawdenim,12ekva,/r/RawDenim Answers: Cleanliness and Smell,28,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12ekva/rrawdenim_answers_cleanliness_and_smell/,"I've noticed this question asked again and again (at least 3 or 4 times in my brief searching, with still under one and a half thousand subscribers), so i figured I'd do a quick answer sheet that can get pinned to the sidebar. Let me know if there's anything that should be added. Links and sources are good too.

**How long should I go before washing?**

&gt;The general consensus here is about 1 year to get some solid fades. The general 'minimum' is 6 months. This was originally decreed by Nudie jeans, but has since become the standard accepted minimum among enthusiasts.

**But what about the smell?!**

&gt;Generally, there is none. I know, mind blowing, right? Your legs typically don't sweat *that* much. Should you start developing any funk, there are a couple options: First, freezing. Fold up your jeans and throw them in the freezer overnight. The cold will inhibit the growth of the bacteria and reduce the smell. They should be fine in the morning. You can also put in a pack of baking soda (much like in a fridge) to help, but it shouldn't be necessary. The second option is to try [Mr. Black's Denim Refresh](http://www.mr-blacks.com/). I've used it myself and it certainly does remove smell (and restore that fresh smell).

**Anything else I can do to stop smell?**

&gt;Rather than leaving your jeans crumpled up on the floor, likely under all your other clothes, hang them. Use the back belt-loop to hang them off a peg or a hangar, so they can air out between wears. Some people (such as myself) say this will yield a year of daily wear with little-to-no smell.

**Okay, no smell, but how about bacteria?**

&gt;A popular resource is to link to [this](http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2011/01/20/consumer-jeans-study.html) article which shows that wearing jeans for even as long as 15 months shows no noticeable increase in bacteria when compared to as little as 1 week's wear. It is, after all, your own bacteria. Granted, it's not a hugely scientific study, but it should quell your concerns.

**I spilled X on my jeans, now what!?**

&gt; Two words: Spot cleaning. Tide to go is a personal favourite, but the aforementioned Mr. Blacks can be used as well. You can even use a bit of water, if it's not too much of a mark. The general rule here is that you want to push the mess OUT of your jeans, so apply whatever cleaner from the inside. The best way to do this is to put a folded, clean paper towel down (to absorb the mess), then press the spot of dirtyness onto it, then from the inside of the jeans, apply your spot cleaner. You can use your finger or something similar to apply pressure and transfer the mess from your jeans into the paper towel. Once the paper towel gets sufficiently dirty, move to a clean spot and repeat. Do this until the spot is gone.

**Okay but it was a BIG mess of X... NOW what?!**

&gt;After it has dried, use an old toothbrush dipped in water and scrub it out. After you get rid of any non-original color and residue, take a dryer sheet and rub the jeans down (for smell), and then let them hang for a week or so.

1373997316.0,26,self.rawdenim,1ife9v,My Gustin Story,33,7,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ife9v/my_gustin_story/,"I am 5'10"", 140 lbs., with very narrow hips. For me, the most important attribute of jeans or any other pants is that they stay up:) This has led me to jeans with a high rise that fit tight in the waist.

My waist measures 32"" with a tape measure when relaxed, but I can reduce it to 30"" by pulling in my abs and tightening the tape. My hips are 34"" relaxed; 33"" when tightening the tape. My thighs are 19 1/2"" relaxed. My inseam is 30"".

For most of my adult life, I wore Levi's 505 (pre-washed). A couple of years ago, Levi's changed the 505 style from Original Fit (similar to 501) to Straight/Regular fit, which has a lower rise. I found the new style less comfortable, and more prone to slide down my hips, so I gave up on 505s.

I switched to 501 (pre-washed) and then decided to give 501 STF a try. I really liked the way the STFs moulded to my waist and hips. Initially I got them in 31"", but for my most recent pair I sized down to 30"" which fit much better. I give them a pre-soak which makes them really tight, but then they stretch out to fit my waist and hips really well.

I live in San Francisco. Early in April while reading the Sunday paper, I came across this article about Gustin:
http://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Gustin-offers-custom-men-s-jeans-under-100-4413003.php
At this point I had never heard the term ""raw denim"", never paid any attention to the way my jeans fit except for the waist and hips, and never considered higher end jeans. But I had been getting frustrated with the short lifespan of my Levi's (they wear through the knees and pockets), so I was intrigued by the prospect of higher quality denim.

I liked the idea of heavyweight denim, so I ordered a pair of Heavy Americans. I had just washed my size 30 STF's, and I compared their fully shrunk measurements with Gustin's fit guide. The 30 straight Gustins looked slightly smaller than my size 30 STF everywhere except the thigh, so I thought they would be a good fit. I only considered Gustin's straight fit, because I was nervous about the lower rise of their slim fit.

I looked at the many interesting fabrics that Gustin continued to offer, but I didn't want to order any more jeans from them until my first pair arrived, and I could see how they fit. Then I noticed a post on their Kickstarter site inviting customers living in San Francisco to visit their office. I arranged a visit with Stephen, and tried on both size 30 and 29. I thought the 30 fit well; it was tight in the waist and hips with room to stretch, but I didn't need to perform any unnatural acts to button up the fly. I found the 29 to be much too tight.

This gave me confidence to order another pair in 30 straight. I am partial to darker denim, and wanted to try a lighter weight, so I ordered the Super Light2.

In early June, my Heavy Americans arrived and I loved them. The measurements matched the fit guide everywhere except the thigh, where they were 2"" narrower than advertised, which was a good thing for me. The fit was a bit snugger everywhere than my 501s. They were very comfortable after a couple of days of break-in. After 2 weeks of wear, the waist has stretched 1"" from 30.5 to 31.5.

The Heavy American denim felt really soft and supple to the touch in spite of the heavy weight. I was debating if I should pre-soak them or not, I decided to go with a pre-soak (in lukewarm water) because I wanted to hem them, and because they had a really objectionable starch smell. The soaking didn't result in any shrinkage (actually the legs stretched slightly from the weight of the denim while drying), but it did eliminate most of the starch odor. When dry, the jeans had lost their soft feel and were very rigid. Some of the softness has returned with wear.

I didn't like the look of cuffs with the heavy denim so I got them hemmed to 30"". Gustin has a deal with A-B Fits to chain-stitch hem their jeans for $10, using the same colored threads as the jeans were originally manufactured with. However, when I got my hemmed jeans back, the red bar-tack on the outer hem was gone. A-B Fits told me they didn't have the equipment to recreate a new bar-tack. I complained about this on Gustin's message board, and Stephen volunteered to put a new bar-tack on my jeans if I dropped them off at the office. 

While back at Gustin's office, I asked if they had any jeans in the office for sale. I found the Heavy Americans to be quite warm, even in the cool San Francisco summer days, and my Super Light2's weren't due to arrive for a while, so I was looking for a medium-weight jean. They had #11 Standard (from Kickstarter) and #2 Japan Standard. 

I loved the look and feel of the #11 Standard, and bought a pair. When I tried them on, they seemed tighter than the 30 but looser than than the 29. They turned out to be a larger-than-usual 29. The waist measured 30"" which is halfway between 29 and 30 on Gustin's fit guide. The jeans were also 2"" narrower in the thigh than the fit guide, which makes me wonder if the fit guide has an error, or if I am measuring wrong. After 2 weeks of wear, the waist has stretched 1"" from 30 to 31.

I didn't pre-soak the Standards, due to lack of shrinkage on my Heavy Americans, lack of strong starch odor, and a desire to not eliminate their soft feel.

I had never worn jeans cuffed before, but decided to try it with my Standards. I had them hemmed to 31 3/4"", so I could either wear them with a 1 3/4"" cuff, or stack them. I had A-B Fits do the hemming again, but this time I gave up on the red bar tack, since it doesn't show when the jeans are cuffed.

The break-in for the Standard took longer than the Heavy American due to the smaller size. It took about 2 weeks for them to feel comfortable in the crotch. But the fit of the 29 Standard is noticeably slimmer than the 30 Heavy American, making me wonder if I should trade in my 30 Super Light2 for 29 when they arrive.

So right now I have 2 pairs of Gustin jeans that I love, and I am waiting for my Super Light2's to arrive. I posted some fit pics here: http://imgur.com/a/n1PqQ The are 4 pics each of my 30 Heavy American, 29 Standard, and (for comparison) my 30 501 STF. The 2nd pic of each jean shows me pinching the material at my thigh, to show how much slack material is there. I have about 2"" slack with the 30 Heavy Americans, 1.5"" with the 29 Standard, and 3"" with the 501 STF.

Although I probably have enough jeans to last me a few years now, if anyone can suggest other brands/styles of equivalent quality to Gustin with a slightly slimmer fit, but with a high rise, I would appreciate it.

I hope my experience helps those considering making the move from 501 STF to Gustin.",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_1ife9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ife9v/my_gustin_story/,

I’ll be making a weekly discussion post every Tuesday with regards to a certain brand (3sixteen, N&amp;F, Samurai, Evisu, Levis, ect). To get us going we can talk about some of the more well-known jeans on this sub so everyone can add something.  After that we can start looking into some higher end and less easily accessible denim once everyone is use to the format.


3sixteen is an American based company that makes jeans for the most part out of Japanese selvedge denim, although I know they have done some from cone mills denim and non selvedge as well. They were founded in 2008 by Andrew Chen with the help of self edge’s Kiya Babzani. The first runs of their jeans were made from denim sourced from japans kaihara and Nihon Menpu mills with the cuts being APC repros. Since then they have made collabs with self-edge and barneys, started a new line (3sixteen+), and moved to having there denim produced almost exclusively from Kuroki mill, offering sanfornized denim in the 3sixteen line, and unsanfornized denim in their + line.

**Nudie Grim Tim : 36 months no wash** :

The Nudie Grim Tim is pretty popular in San Jose, or anywhere in general. It has a loose thigh, but strong taper. Unfortunately the material from Nudie Jeans are simply too weak. I wanted to see how long i could wear these before they are unwearable, and the result was exactly 3 years. Here are the fades I achieved over the 3 years.  
I would recommend these jeans to anyone who are starting the ""raw"" denim trend.

*Imperial jeans are really one of a kind quality. If you flip the jeans inside out, you'll really be able to see the type of craftsmanship that was put into these jeans. But anyways, back to the Prospectors. Imperial hasn't released a new line of jeans for ~4 years, and the prospectors are one of the three new lines of jeans that Imperial are releasing over this summer. They are very loose on the thigh, and has a strong taper(the taper isn't as strong as the Shearers though). They are also starchless, so it feels amazing putting these on. There hasn't really been any pictures of them yet, so here you go:*

It appears to be a Levi's Type III Trucker jacket with the big E, and no front hand pockets, so pre-1971 I presume?

I put them on, fit like a charm. However, the waist is stretching easily- I'm thinking I didn't size down enough. Wearing them without a belt will make them too loose, wearing them with a belt makes the rigidness uncomfortable around my stomach. Not really sure, I'll see how it goes. Crotch is a bit... Confining. Even at the best of times.

They came very rigid, as expected, but just 1 day later and they're comfortable to walk around in (still rigid to take off).

Now, with all that boring stuff out of the way.

The rainbow shows before it fades. It's hard to tell, but you can see the varying shades underneath the indigo. Honeycombs are looking like they'll be great so far. Strange red patch, not sure if leather; but looks good with the N&amp;F logo.

tl;dr not much is going on. They look great, and fit great, but they feel a bit uncomfortable (as expected).

EDIT: Considering the upvotes, I'll probably update after 7 or so days of wear, then 1 month in, etc. I also noticed a bruise on my knee- might be the denim, might be the initial rigidness, might be the learning to ski for the 3 days prior to putting these on- not really sure.",,False,,t5_2scl9,1362703020.0,,,True,t3_19viui,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/19viui/introductory_nf_rainbowcore_review/,

I'm also aware my undershirt in no way matches.  It is 80 degrees outside I'm not wearing the damn thing outside!)

http://imgur.com/a/A1xpE

*Rakuten*:

Was pretty straightforward and easy.  I ordered from 2ND shop and I rather quickly got an email from the company.  I ran it through translate to figure out they wanted me to pay via PayPal instead of credit card.  I responded back saying that's fine so he went me a link for PayPal that had the funding all filled in.  Once I payed him it was shipped out the next day.

It went from Japan to Chicago overnight where it stayed in customs fro the next two days.  From reading online that seems pretty common.  Then USPS tried to deliver it once, I wasn't home so I went to the post office to pick it up.  I kind of freaked out because I thought customs siezed the item or something because the word they used on the tracking site was ""Retention"" which means it is at the post office after being bounced for delivery.

Here is a screen shot of the delivery process: http://i.imgur.com/RPNeDq7.jpg

*Shirt*:

The sizes for the various colors were somewhat sparse.  This is the last season's fall collection of TFH so pretty much just left over stock.  I really wanted the red color (it comes in a variety: blue, mustard, green, red) and the closest in my size was 36.  I knew it ran a bit small and I'm more a natural size 37.  But figured what the hell it's close enough.  If I had my way I'd get a 38 I think.  It is a bit tight when closed but I think looks pretty nice open.  So if you are between sizes I'd error on the size of the larger end.  I will note I'm a bit muscular throughout the chest and arms so this may not be gospel for everyone.  My forearms are a bit too big to comfortably snap the cuffs.

Basically it is like wearing a blanket.  The flannel is *thick*.  Really thick.  The interior fabric is soft as a bunny.  Overall the garment just screams build and fabric quality.  I see it being a fall staple for me since I like to wear vests instead of full on jackets.  The hardware is all nice with inlay of mother of pearl.  My wife is already trying to steal it referring to it as my ""$250 Snuggie.""


*Samurai*:

They are what they are.  Fantastic construction, outstanding denim.  Fading is going as it goes.  I took a month off from wearing them to wear my Momos but I'm back to these.  Wearing them outside in the blistering sun is like I'm taking a nutsack sauna.

I love raw denim, and I love reddit so I decided to keep 'em in the 'family'. 

They arrived today and thankfully they fit. I've decided i'm going to patch them, and I want to get my hands on some cone mills duck canvas or something similar in a nutmeg color if possible.
My goal is to patch from the inside with a bit of a contrasting color to let the unique ""acid wash"" remain on display.

Can anyone help me find the material to patch these bad boys?

You can bet your ass there will be fit pictures, and pictures of the process if i can pull this off. Just bought a new 50mm lens for my camera.

Thank you

**Levi's 501 STF - 30x32**

Measurements | Before Soak | After Soak |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
| Waist | 31.5"" | 30""|
| Hip 4"" above crotch | 42"" | 38"" |
| Thigh 1"" below crotch | 23"" | 22""|

| Front rise | 12"" | 11.75"" |
| Back rise | 15.5"" | 15"" |
| Inseam | 32"" | 30"" |

Notes:

* I soaked these in hot water for a half hour in my washing machine, drained the water, and let them drip dry in my shower.
* I did wear them for about a half hour last when they were still a little damp, and when I woke up this morning they were stiff as a board.
* My actual waist is 32-33"", and I was advised in another thread to buy these in a 30"". They're tight right now, but I can button them and I think they'll stretch just enough to be comfortable.
* Above the knee, the fit is pretty great, but below the knee is a little straighter than I'm used to. I might soak them below the knee to try to get a little more shrinkage and a smaller leg opening.
* The rise is about an inch higher than I'm used to and feels weird, so hopefully I get used to that.
* Made in Egypt.
* I don't know if these will be my favorite jeans ever, but the process has been fun so far and I glad I bought them.",,False,,t5_2scl9,1362098647.0,,,True,t3_19ecb4,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/19ecb4/levis_501_stf_before_after_measurements/,

I'm headed downtown to partake in SXSW music festival. Rocking the jeans.  In a bit of a hurry, so will update later, but if any of you Austin redditors are out and about tonight shoot me a message. 

LETS GET WEIRD!!!

Had them rolled high because I was bicycling around all night. Ignore the ripped collar, collateral sxsw damage. 

The jeans fit great. I would hem them if keeping them, but as far as waist, rise, and fit they are spot on. Some fades are already starting to show from the previous wearers. 

Will keep updates of my misadventures. Finishing up some emails now, and then headed out!

Edit 3: about to head to auditorium shores for flaming lips/divine fits/Jim James. Meet us out there sxsw'rs!

As promised, and small album from the last few days. http://imgur.com/a/s7p7P 

As you can probably tell, comfort is KEY at SXSW. Temperature's were averaging in the 80's, and walking/biking is a huge part of the festival. This week I will be working so you'll get to see a bit more 'adult' outfits. Thursday I am going to my hometown. It's a small island on the Texas coast. Plenty of good scenery. Will Update!

Edit 4: Been busy with work from the post SXSW grind. 

Got a few pictures to upload, but am taking a friend on a tour of town Friday, concert saturday, and going shooting sunday, so will have a bunch pictures after this weekend. 


Anyway, few shots:

(questions/pics)",26,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1atxzc/first_pair_of_raws_rogue_territory_stantons_first/,"I've been in agony the past two weeks. I ordered my first ever pair of raw denim, after lurking and shopping around for a while I decided to pull the trigger on a pair from Rogue Territory. I noticed after it shipped that paypal had automatically set my shipping address to match my billing so while I was away at school I had to wait so long to try out my first pair. But at long last the day has come and I'm wearing them.

Here they are, a pair of [Rogue Territory Stanton 14.5oz](http://www.rogueterritory.com/store/stanton/)

[Button Detail](http://i.imgur.com/5q2E6uO.jpg)

**First observations:** The material feels much different from the denim I've traditionally worn. The texture when I first pulled them out of the bag was unlike I had ever felt. It was to be expected of course but the ""raw"" really came through. They didn't feel rough, just a little gritty but after putting them on the inside felt completely different and feels good.

[Leather Patch](http://i.imgur.com/fciPCHR.jpg)

**Choosing my size:** I've been a peasant bootcut jean wearer for the past few years and was looking to kick the habit so I decided what better way to be able to drop/sell all my old jeans than to have a pair of jeans I can wear everyday. Needless to say the fit of straight jeans is a bit foreign to me, for denim anyways. I have some straight leg chinos and cords but the denim was a new experience. I am surprised how long it took me to buy jeans that fit like this. The silhouette is defiantly more flattering. Coming off of bootcut jeans the only measurements I could trust to use was the waist size and the upper thigh. Measuring a pair of my Diesels I came to about 16"" waist and 11"" thigh. The size (vanity) was a 30x32. After wearing it for a year or so I had decent room so I figured I could step down in size because it will stretch. I decided to not drop to RT size 29 but instead opted for a 28 hoping for the ""perfect"" fit when they were worn in. This would drop the waist size to 15"" and the thigh to 10.5"". I was curious how they would fit and I have been waiting for this day to find out.

[Selvedge cuff](http://i.imgur.com/oa4z60y.jpg)

**Initial Fit:** They are understandably stiff upon the initial wear. I am now about an hour in. The question are starting to arise just from general lack of knowledge on the subject. Getting to top button buttoned was a little tight but its not uncomfortable when I have the pair on or when I'm moving around in them. Thighs feel good, they aren't being choked but its certainly a better fit than I had before. Moving down, I come to my first issue. The knee area feels tight, at first I felt like I didn't want to bend my knees. (*defiantly becomes looser and more relaxed with wear*) It seemed stiff and tight when sitting at first but feels a bit more relaxed after only an hour of wear. Is this normal to expect? If I had chosen a size 29 I would only gain .25"" in the knee area so I figure its just an area that needs to wear in. Sizing up would only make everything else looser. The length obvious these need to be cuffed to wear right now. Karl being the small manufacturer he is is able to produce more denim if the inseam is left at 36"" lucky me that I live 30 minutes outside of NYC and I can hop on the train to chain(-stiching that is). 

[Interior detail](http://i.imgur.com/1RtFYTd.jpg)

This is currently how my jeans fit. I worked out a lot in the summer and haven't done much of that since going to school this year. The only place I accumulate any flab is the bottom of my stomach and my lower back. I've been working out again to reduce this so I'm not so worried about the waist fit being just a little snug. My only concern at the moment is the knee being tight. If anyone has experienced this and can tell me that I should be sizing up or that its just part of the new pair break in that'd be great.

Prompted by a thread about black denim a couple of days ago I figure we might as well start here. The plan is to do a brief rundown on what makes this kind of denim different, why you might want to own a pair, and give some examples of this type of denim. If anybody has progress/fit pictures encorporating this type of denim I'd like to append them to this thread.

**Black Denim**

Black denim, in general terms, is simply denim that features a black dyed warp rather than the traditional indigo dyed warp. It's important to note that black dye doesn't necessarily act like indigo dye in all cases. It's generally believed that black dye is slightly more resilient than indigo dye, causing black dyed denim to fade slower and more evenly than equivalent indigo dyed denim. As a result, high contrast fades will be generally harder to produce on black denim. All black dye, however, is not created evenly. As I'll talk about more later, certain denim producers have gone out of their way to develop and/or use black dyes that have more indigo-like fade characteristics or even permanent/no-fade characteristics. 

There are two main types of black denim; a more traditional black warp/white weft (BW/WW) or black warp/black weft (BW/BW). 

BW/WW denim often has, for lack of a better word, more initial character than a BW/BW denim. The contrasting white weft allows this type of denim's appearance to vary strongly with the weave used. As BW/WW denim generally has a standard white warp core it will fade to grey and then to white with wear. Because of the aforementioned dye qualities I find that BW/WW denim starts looking somewhat washed out before it produces striking high contrast fades. Somebody looking for high contrast black denim fades might be interested in [The Flat Head’s 4002]( http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1hgu5m/black_raw_denim/caue4ed) model due to its use of a black dye with indigo-like fading properties. Thanks to /u/CyclingTrivialities for providing [this example](http://topicstock.pantip.com/siam/topicstock/F3611121/F3611121-0.jpg) of a nicely faded pair of BW/WW denim, /u/apotheque for showing us [these completely abused Nudies](http://media.tumblr.com/6a44512c6ac97ae54f01a7768dffcd64/tumblr_inline_mjhr8l5PKE1qz4rgp.jpg), and 3Sixteen's /u/AJChen for this pair of [gorgeous ST-200X's](http://i.imgur.com/PoLR1LG.jpg).

Somewhat more common is the very saturated BW/BW type denim. This type of denim is characterized by its even, deep, and inky black appearance. Because of this feature BW/BW denim can look more similar to trousers as they mostly lack the colour and texture variation typical of traditional denim. For extra saturation some manufacturers use a sulfur dying process on this type of denim which can lend the denim a somewhat unique scent initially. Others manufacturers use permanent non-fade dyes on their BW/BW denim to maintain a saturated black hue over time. Many of the [better](http://i.imgur.com/9XK7g5Hh.jpg) [monochrome](http://i.imgur.com/tRsVFBk.jpg) fits on the /r/malefashionadvice subreddit make great use of this type of denim.

I was pretty torn between the #55 and the #20 (heavy japan) but opted for something more diverse from my current selvedge (UB101). I'm curious though- from everything I've read, seen, heard, the color of the weft has a pretty huge impact on the fades and overall character throughout the life of a pair of raw denim- how different is an indigo/indigo jean going to mature? Who has experience, photos, stories of their indigo/indigo denim?

I was expecting my Light Italians and Japan Redlines, but little did I know, I would be in for a treat. I got my Japan Redlines (which I am wearing right now :p), but instead of the Light Italians, I got this mysterious, but amazing pair of jeans. They're extremely odd because they feel like soft wool, are very neppy, and have the craziest beige double red selvedge. I don't think Gustin has ever made jeans in this fabric (neither the ""Japan Redlines"" or these mystery jeans have a name tag), so here I am sharing this with you. For reference, I am 230 lbs 6'5"" and am wearing a 36 slim.

TL;DR Gustin sent me jeans that don't exist on their website.

The Gustin's seem to be quite well made, there are some loose threads here and there which I'll remove but nothing drastic.

They're a good fit, tighter than my other jeans but hopefully not into the emo realm of tightness.

They've served me well (5 years come April), but they just don't get that much wear these days, and when i do wear jeans, i rarely reach for these.
There is still life in them, so I'll give them to whoever wants them, based on the following terms &amp; conditions (hence the asterisks)

a)  Free, but you cover shipping.  If you're in Toronto, i can probably meet up with you.

b)  Only claim these if you're truly going to wear them!  What I would love to see is somebody take them, patch any holes, fix any stitching problems, and really solidify them.  However, if you choose to keep them as is, that's your call, just fix them.

c)  (Optional) - wash them.  Just.  Yeah.


That's really it.
Size is tagged 31 x 38 (i think that's the inseam), but i think they've stretched to around a 33ish.  If really required, i'll measure them BiG style, but really, anybody that's a 31 - 33 should fit these.

I have always been strictly a 501 STF guy.  Not necessarily by preference, but because until now that was the only jean I could find to fit me.  These came in the mail today and I am pleased to say the least.  

They are thinner and lighter than I expected, even though I knew they would be 13.5 oz.  They seem to be put together well!  For people who own Unbranded jeans, these are nowhere near as stiff when new.  They seem pretty soft and have already stretched a smidge since this morning.  I'm pretty short at 5'7'', so I had to cuff them twice and still get this stacking.  The leather patch is thin and flimsy.  The stitching shows a great attention to detail.

I just bought some 3sixteen SL-120x in size 32 from Blue Owl. After one day of wear, the sewing around the buttons has come undone. \

The pants were snug, but not ridiculous. I could button them on my first try. So I am really not sure why this happened. Is it common? What should I do? Mend them? Contact Blue Owl? (I have thrown away the tags and I wore them for an entire day already and I had them hemmed to a 34 inseam). 

I guess I'm just disappointed that these supposedly well constructed jeans are coming apart already. Any advice is appreciated.

Can't believe they already look so contrasty. Everyday is a pleasure to wear these jeans. They're unsaforized so I'm thinking of soaking them in another few months (read: 10 months) to shrink them back down to their original tightness. right now they're just about perfect though. What do you guys think? 

P.S. sorry for the shitty pictures. I only have a cellphone camera and a digital camera that's like 4 years old. I tried to get the best shots I could, but not that great. I'll try and get a friend with a nice camera for my next update.


EDIT: I know i know, i didn't do an initial soak so soaking them will ""mess up"" the fades or whatever. I didn't mean I would soak them anytime soon, they're still brand new! I was thinking around the 1 year mark I would soak/wash them. and it doesn't really matter even if the fades look ""out of place."" they're just jeans, they'll look sick no matter what. thanks for the concern though.

After years of Superfuture, I felt it would be great if a community existed which was much more welcoming and accessible to all denim heads, including newcomers.


So it has been to my surprise that there are now over 200 of you cool kids refusing to wash your denim in pursuit of the perfect fades and fits, with posting almost every day on your questions and progress.

Although it may still be premature, I was hoping there are at least two or three of you who would like to become involve as moderators. Not only to oversee operations here, but to promote the growth this subreddit to MFA, and other fashion/clothing subreddits.

Additionally, It might be cool if we are to create a cool subreddit logo, maybe the alien with jeans on? Just a thought, but in the meantime I hope to tweak the subreddit to make it more user-friendly and alive. Expect a sidebar, flair (to list the pair(s) you are working on) and other upgrades to be added in the coming weeks.

Got the 121s in late January and wore them every day for about 3 months until I started rotating them with my APCs. Got the 211s in May and have been wearing them 3-4 times a week.  The 121s were great for winter and faded ridiculously fast, which was very satisfying as they were my first pair of raws. The denim has stayed pretty stiff but is fairly comfortable, even thought the rise is pretty low.  The 211s have a beautiful color and streakiness to them which will hopefully become more apparent with wear.

A.P.C. Petit Standard
32x34

No washes, soaks, tailoring, whatever else. Wore them straight out of the package. 
Worn anywhere from 5 to 7 times a week.

Started: 3/21/13 
Pictures Taken: 4/23/13


After about a month of wear, I'm really enjoying this pair of jeans. The fit is spot on, stacks and honeycombs 
and whatnot are coming in  well, at least in my opinion. I've been really impressed with A.P.C. so far, 
but I know they have sort of a bad reputation as far as their price in relation to the quality. I picked these 
up on sale, and I think they've been well worth the money. 

They have stretched a lot, but I don't really consider that a bad thing. They were very tight in the thighs for 
the first week or so, but have since loosened up and are comfortable. I wear a belt almost all the time, so the
waist hasn't stretched too much, but enough that they fit comfortably and button very easily. 

The weight of the denim is nice, not extremely heavy or constricting, but still substantial compared to average 
denim. They're not quite as heavy as I remember my UB101s being. 

Add your questions and experiences with A.P.C. denim in the comments. I'd love to hear what other (more experienced)
people have to say.

I have a worn pair of APC Petit Standards in size 33, already hemmed. Sounds crappy, right? Well - read on:

* I wore them 3-5 times tops. They were hemmed too short for my taste, I decided to give them a chance, but gave up quickly. So, I got a new pair and left them a bit longer this time.

* They have never been washed, soaked, exposed to rain or dirt. I'm a very clean person, so they don't smell either (pinky swear).

* The hemming was done by a pro, please refer to the pictures.

* The inseam measures 33.5"" from the bottom of the crotch down on the un-cuffed leg; 30"" on the cuffed one (cuffed twice if it matters).

* Tagged size is 33, but since APC's stretch a bit from the first wear on I'd say they would fit someone wearing a 34 perfectly, which is my size.


I'd like to keep it to students / high schoolers / low income / raw denim newcomers again, I feel bad if I have to turn someone down, but I can only do so much. So far I have given away 2 pairs here already (Nudie &amp; N+F's Ducks), I always pay the postage and I make sure they're packed up nicely.

So, [HERE IS THE ALBUM OF SAID JEANS](http://imgur.com/a/lYB1x#3).

If you have any questions please feel free to ask, and again - more to come as I fight my way through my closet.

Oh, and any hairs in the pic are from my pug, so if you're allergic let me know and I'll make sure to lint brush the shit out of everything (which I do anyway, but it's better to let me know).

Have a good day everyone!

1359520140.0,18,self.rawdenim,17jkcf,Unique pair of raw selvedge jeans I picked up in a Tokyo thrift store. Goodhood x R. Newbold. Can you guys tell me anything about these?,23,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/17jkcf/unique_pair_of_raw_selvedge_jeans_i_picked_up_in/,"[GHxRN ""bones"" denim imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/FZnMP)

Just got back from a trip involving a Tokyo stop where one of my main goals was to pick up an interesting pair of Japanese denim. Stumbled across this pair in a thrift store (Komehyo, second hand department store) and loved the offbeat detailing. It doesn't really look like these were ever really worn as they're still stiff with what I assume is the signature raw denim starch (please let them not be stiff from an appearance in a bukkake film). Was planning on buying them regardless of fit but it turns out they're actually pretty passable on me with the exception of a rise a bit high for my liking. Did fairly some fairly extensive Google work on the collaboration and it looks like it goes back a while. However, I couldn't find a single mention or picture of this particular pair anywhere. Some of the details:

Denin: Feels raw, definitely selvedge. R. Newbold is a Japanese designer so I wouldn't be surprised if this was Japanese denim. Feels high quality.

Fit: Waist was listed in store as a ""medium"". Probably a 32 as it fits my true 33 waist a bit tight. Cut looks to be tapered and slim; they fit somewhat like my weird guys with a higher rise and shorter inseam. 

Details: The first thing when I noticed when I put these on in the store was what I thought was reinforcements running down the legs. Turns out these are raw denim bone cutouts of your femur/tibia glued on the inside of the jeans in the appropriate position on both the front and back inside of the legs. GHxRN branding abounds, with a red sewn detail of the logo on the left pocket, GHxRN patch on the right pocket (with selvedge coin pocket detail), and GHxRN patch on the back pocket. Most of the stitching on the jean is half contrast, half indigo which looks awesome in my opinion (one stitch line is orange, one indigo). Button fly buttons are white powder coated metal of some type with the top button bearing some GHxRN branding. Leather patch is thick and embossed with some GHxRN graphics. Back most belt loop is diagonal for no apparent reason. Pictures don't do the color justice, but they've got a different hue than my N&amp;F LHT Indigo's.


Regardless of rarity or true value I think these are a really cool pair of raw denim with many interesting but fairly subtle touches. What do you guys think? Sorry about the lighting/picture quality, all pics hastily snapped and uploaded from a SGS2.

I washed these jeans for the first time about two months ago because they got stinky, and a little bit of dirt I can handle but I don't really wanna walk around in smelly pants. There was some indigo loss after the wash but not as much as I expected, and the last vestiges of that sheeny-ness was gone.

Following up from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ifvhk/what_should_i_check_out_in_san_francisco_downtown/) where I didn't want to spend over $175 for my first pair of 100% raw japanese denim, I ended up spending $265, and I'm really happy about it.

They are 31 waist, slim, 17oz, but feel great. Only worn 4 times. The cuff is way too much, but that's bc they were not hemmed enough and the pants came too long, even after they measured me out.

I'm currently working on a java application to help find what brand and cut of denim is right for you. It's just a fun thing because I wanted a project for the summer. I took a programming class last year and I want something to do over the summer to practice and build upon what I learned. I am also using this as a chance to better understand XML.

How it works currently: 

You enter your preferred (either measured from a current pair or estimated) measurements of the waist, rise, thigh, knee, and leg opening. The program then runs through a large data file compiled with measurements from many models of jeans in all sizes. It then outputs a set of jeans that fit fairly close to the inputted parameters. 

I have a request for the help of the community:

What are the ""tolerances"" on measurements? What I mean is, if you wanted a waist measurement of 32 inches, would +/- how much would be acceptable? Same for all the other measurements. This will help me figure out how to make the program search effectively. 

I need to input many brands, cuts, and sizes of jeans into a  text file. If you'd like to help, send me a PM.

Are there any other features you guys would you like to have?",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_1iztvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1iztvn/size_and_fit_java_application/,

To get us going we can talk about some of the more well-known jeans on this sub so everyone can add something. After that we can start looking into some higher end and less easily accessible denim once everyone is use to the format.

Naked &amp; Famous is a Canadian company known for producing unique, rare, sometimes gimmicky and classic raw denim. Founded in 2008 by Brandon Svarc they were initially quoted as being made to compete with apc as well as providing some heavier weight and classic Japanese selvege. The first run of jeans had the core models in 13oz indigo, 18oz big slub as well as a 21oz line. Since then they have expanded to be one of the most diverse raw denim companies having everything from the heaviest jeans ever made (32oz), to thermo chromatic, rainbow fade, glow in the dark, and more. Well still offering options for classic denim lovers. N&amp;F has also done collaborations with oni, big john, kamikazee attack ect.

Bought on March 30th. No washes, No soaks, No tailoring, Worn cuffed, Worn every single day for one month. Size 30 and stayed true to size or maybe sized down 1 not exactly too sure. The fit pics (only pics I had with my jeans) were taken April 28. The stand alone flat pics were taken May 1st.

I got these APC's exactly a month ago after a friend recommended buying some raw denim jeans for work. When I first got em it took me about 10 minutes of dancing in the dressing room to button the top button and my leg could barely bend (I got some big thighs). But after 2 nights of sleeping in them they are probably the most comfortable jeans I have worn. They are a little loose in the waist, but I like it that's what a belt is for. I wear these everyday 12 hours a day to work. My job usually requires heavy lifting, walking and stairs. As you can tell from the fades, I put my wallet and cellphone in my back pockets and a zippo in the coin pocket. I noticed the crotch area is fading as well, but oh well. 

Sorry about the lack of the fit pics. My house is too dark to get a decent fit picture, and the only camera I have (cellphone) has no self timer.

Just thought I'd share my first experience with raw denim. I freakin love these jeans and the fit.

EDIT: http://imgur.com/a/EEAMM
(Here are some Fit Pics. The pictures with the black tank top are the fit pics when I first got the jeans, so friggin tight on the thighs. The ones in the Sapporo shirt are fit pics I took last night after work. I love how comfortable they are now)

I've got a rotten cell phone camera without any access to photoshop at the moment; I did the best I did to snap some photos, but [Blue Owl's](http://blueowlworkshop.blogspot.com/2012/02/naked-and-famous-skinny-guy-hemp-blend.html) photos do much better justice.


+ [Obligatory r/trees meets r/rawdenim pic](http://i.imgur.com/SSG1H.jpg)


+ Upon first opening these jeans out of the package (warning: karmaloop has the best deals on N&amp;F, but will inevitably ship them with creases that must be worked out), there were many little [hemp strings](http://i.imgur.com/JH80f.jpg) that were on the denim. I'm not sure if this was an intentional gimmick or a natural part of the process


+ The green selvedge is a nice break from the typical red; [pocket](http://i.imgur.com/E2MFR.jpg)


+ The hemp/denim blend breaths slightly better and is more flexible than N&amp;F's standard blend; nonetheless, this did not compromise the [formative stages of honeycombing](http://i.imgur.com/YdPop.jpg) or any other molding for that matter

+ The brown tinge to the denim from the hemp is ever-so-subtle and I would not recommend this denim for anyone who is considering buying them for the brown-ness

+ I heard that these jeans carried a slightly hempy aroma upon opening them, but I wasn't able to tell because karmaloop sent this [shitty shampoo sampler](http://i.imgur.com/TJxyU.jpg) that made the jeans smell like a woman. Even though the packaging creased and made the jeans smell funny, I'll still buy from karmaloop because through a combination of this being on sale, using promo codes, a rep code and various accumulated gift codes through my other purchases, I got these jeans from their original $165 price tag down to $50. You gotta make a few sacrifices sometimes. 

I'll be breaking these in and wearing them for the next 2 months in Guatemala, where I'll be staying in the summer for Spanish school. I'll letcha guys know how these withstand the tropical weather and I hope to god that the drug dogs won't go nuts when I go through security. 

tl;dr review: very promising jeans, but nothing remarkably ""hempy"" that have distinguished them from normal denim--yet.

These were my first pair of raw denim that I in January 12, 2012. So I've had them for approximately 18 months, but realistically these only have 12 months of actual wear. The first time I soaked these was when they were 4 months old. First wash was June 2012 and last wash was May 2013.

I retired these jeans because the fit was horrible. When I purchased these jeans I didn't look too much into raw denim and I thought that they would've stretched a lot more everywhere, but I was wrong and I just decided to work on my new pair UB201(broke college kid).

Taken on my 4S so the quality is absolutely shit

They're raw size 29 pbj xx-012s. I was able to button them, but it was pretty snug in the waist, as well as the thighs (like.. skin tight). My hope is that they would stretch out, but I'm not sure how much. I tried on a size 30 (forgot to take pics), and it fit comfortably, but I'm positive the waist would stretch too much if I got that.

(large post, sorry)",16,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/19qup0/researching_my_first_pair_of_raws_i_included_some/,"Sup guys. Looking to step up my denim game a bit and I've been doing some research. Now I'm looking for some informed opinions about what I should get.

My current favorite pair of jeans are some [uniqlo skinny fit tapered in indigo](http://i.imgur.com/WPOGULi.jpg) (that's me in the pic. I'm 5'11 145lbs, so fairly skinny). They are tagged as 29, with a listed waist width of 31 inches.

However, I think they may even be a bit small. See [this image](http://i.imgur.com/4v1OLpG.jpg). I feel like I should be wearing them at the top red line, but they fall naturally on the lower red line. In order to get them to the top red line I have to cinch my belt quite a bit, which creates bunching and stuff. 

I think that means the waist is too big, do you guys think that is the case? If it is, then that means I need a waist smaller than 31.

Another concern I have based on my current jeans is the crotch height (the purple line in the picture). Another reason why I wear them lower is because it feels a bit roomier in the crotch region. I'm worried that if I get a smaller waist and wear my jeans higher, then I will have less room in the crotch which could make things a bit uncomfortable.

**Options:**

I have done some preliminary research, but because I am still a bit unsure about sizing, I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing.

[Rogue Territory SK](http://www.rogueterritory.com/store/sk-12-5oz/). The smallest these go is 28, with a waistband of 14.5. This puts them at around two inches smaller (total waist) than my current uniqlo ones, which might be enough to solve my low waist issue, but I'm not sure if it will account for stretch. I may need more of a 27.

[3sixteen ST-100X](http://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/st100x-slim-leg-raw-indigo-denim). These also only go down to 28, with a 29 waist. Would I need to size down more to account for shrink?

There is also the [UB101](http://www.theunbrandedbrand.com/denim/ub101/). It's much cheaper than my other options, though, and I'm unsure if there are any downsides.

So that's the research I have done so far. Let me know if there is any info I can add, but I look forward to hearing your thoughts on my best option.

Couple other things:

I'd like to thank the entire mod team for their recent hard work in improving the subreddit, specially /u/lobstertainment for his tireless CSS work and work on the sidebar and more. We expect it to only get bigger and better from here!

Please remember to add your sizes to the Open Source Size Guide in the sidebar, it's only going to be useful to people if we get A LOT more entries.  It's ok if you don't have all the measurements.

Everyone asks the question of import duties and 2nd was very helpful with marking as low value 15 000 yen and as a gift. If the price had been over 20 000 yen I would be subject to 16% import duties 


The jeans arrived in a shipping envelope and bag and with a beautiful hand made fan and of course my flat head 3002

I HIGHLY recommend this process. The   Chances of getting hit with duties are present and exchanges can be tough but if you do your research you could save quite a bit of cash ( I saved over $100) and have a beautiful pair of new denim!

On the fifth wear of my st-200x I was sitting down on my couch and leaned forward to put my shoes on and the top button cracked off.  The metal split in a way that the back of the button is still attached but the front fell completely off. Anyone have any idea what I can do to have then repaired or had a similar experience?  I don't think I'll be able to do a straight return as I've had the jeans hemmed.

These are my 2nd pair of raws (1st being cheapo 501s) and I really like the fit. The rise is nuts, but outside these pictures, I rarely tuck shirts into jeans (if ever) so I'm not worried about looking too dadly.

I know the button is pulling in the waist a little, but I understand they'll stretch and I'm trying to knock off a few lbs anyway so hey.

I wore these jeans almost every single day for two months, and it's tapered off to about three times a week for the last month.  The waist seems to definitely be a bit big on me at an alleged 28 (looks/feels to me like about 30.5 right now- although it was *advertised as 'loose taper'*), but it's fine since I got my Orion leather belt.

The combs are setting in really nicely along the back, although pretty much none on the front (a few fold marks), and definitely much more on the right leg.  The crotch is starting to approach questionable.  I put a lot of stress on it the way I sit, so I might start looking into reinforcement after another three months (this sucks, but it's just part of the struggle).

* Original Purchase was 1 size down, I was wearing a 32 and purchased a 31. I am 5'11"" and 145.

* Now I am wearing a 31 and the waist is about perfect but the stretch on the thighs and seat made them flair.

* Unfortunately I cannot find my original fit pics that I took the day they arrived.

* They are about 4.5 months old.

* I wear them 2 or 3 days a week and wore them every day for around 1 month.

* Total wear is probably around 1.5 months.

Tailoring

* This was a pretty awesome experience.  I brought them in last week along with 3 Uniqlo OCBDs that I needed hemmed. (I am wearing one in the new fit pics).

* He pinned them up so I could see how they would look and we went with it. We took off about 1"" at the thigh to about 1.5""-2"" at the cuff

* Total price for 3 shirts and slimming 1 pair of pants... $31!

* I was expecting just the pants to be $40 so I think I made out like a bandit.

Pros:

* The fit is MUCH better now, I am REALLY happy with them. The thighs don't flair and the seat actually fits now. It also doesn't look like I am wearing boot cut because of my girly chicken legs.

* Most of the fading that was already happening is still looking normal. Will have to wait and see what they look like with a few more months of wear.

Cons:

* He did not keep the same kind of seam on the inside so if I cuff there is no longer a selvage line. Fortunately I never cuff my jeans. [PIC](http://i.imgur.com/OZwwaYk.jpeg)

* The knee bulge/fade moved over by about 1 inch. It is now clearly not centered and some of the fading is slightly cut off by the seam.  This is pretty noticeable to me but I think with a month or so of wear it should all even out since the knees were not super faded to begin with. Not sure if anyone else would notice.

Ok, a little backstory. A couple years ago when I was just getting into the online raw denim community I discovered Rawrdenim and began obsessively reading and learning, not long after I became obsessed, I saw this now famous N&amp;F BiG fade friday.

http://www.rawrdenim.com/2011/09/fade-friday-naked-famous-x-blue-in-green-weird-guy-9-5-months-0-washes/

After seeing those pictures I knew I needed a pair, I had never seen fades that looked that good. The only problem with this was that there were only 40 pairs of that particular collaboration and they had been sold out for almost a year at that point. I wasn't optimistic, but that didn't stop me. After searching for countless hours online, calling every raw denim dealer I could find and N&amp;F directly, I finally found a pair. Tate &amp; Yoko had one pair, they aren't the exact same pair in that Fade Friday, but they are the same fabric and cut (the only difference being that there is no BiG branding and they are not chainstitched). 

The only problem was that they were a size smaller than I would normall wear in a WG (I would size down 2 to a 29, they were 28), I didn't care, I ordered them immediately. When I got them they were everything I dreamed they would be and I started wearing them immediately, however the size was a problem, they were just too small for me and that paired with the stiffness of the fabric made them a nightmare to squeeze into every day. I finally stopped wearing them after the top button popped off. I considered them a lost cause and moved onto a pair of APCs. However after completely destroying that pair I have come back to my grail N&amp;Fs. I got the button put back on, they have stretched out a bit and softened up, so they aren't such a trial to wear every day, they are still very small, but I like skinny fits so I really don't mind that much.  Then there is a shameless selfie/fit pic that I took when I first got them.

I'm not sure exactly how long I have been wearing them because I took a long break, I would guess about 5 months, but it could be more or less, I honestly don't know. However they are starting to show some great fades, so I figured I would post them here.",,False,,t5_2scl9,1368071927.0,,,True,t3_1dz0p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1dz0p6/nf_21oz_wg_evo_pics/,

I recently gave away two pairs of denim on here; I messaged a lot of people stating that if I came across anything else I'd let them know.

Now, I don't really have any denim to give away right now, however - I did find a bunch of other stuff in my closet (either unworn or worn 2-3 times) that is not denim related. But, most of us like the same brands here (from what I could tell), so I was wondering how you guys (and especially the mods) would feel about me posting non-denim related clothing on here. I earn enough and I live comfortably, so I wouldn't post anything for sale, I'd just give everything away again. I know there are subreddits like /r/assistance, but I love the feeling of the small community and lack of shit talking on here. Newbies are always treated with respect, no one is being bashed (unless they're begging for it) and I'd like to keep this within ""the family"" if you know what I mean.

Another issue I have come across is the shipping. I would never ask anyone for money, but it's still a huge pain in the ass (especially when shipping overseas).

Keep it organized. Like the [Brick and Mortar Stores Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/19ehtn/brick_and_mortar_stores_thread), we'll do

I can get the measurements off of a different size, if required. 

The denim for the redline is 14.5oz redline selvage from Kaihara and the whiteline is 14oz Whiteline selvage from Kurabo Mills in Japan. Ou denim is significantly more expensive than most of the competing brands that we are working towards. Everything is designed, cut and sewn here in San Francisco and we are personally visiting our partners to make sure everything comes out right every time.

Lately I've been thinking about getting a raw denim jacket.

I would prefer it to be a darker wash.

The jacket I have found that I do like is the Rogue Territory DKIND:

1351808075.0,15,self.rawdenim,12hcnk,"Unbranded, Tellason, and Raleigh Denim: A breakdown.",16,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12hcnk/unbranded_tellason_and_raleigh_denim_a_breakdown/,"I currently own 3 pairs of Raw Denim, and I thought /r/RawDenim might want to see how I think they stack up. I am unfamiliar with APC, Nudies, and Naked and Famous, and Momotaros raw denim, which seem to be the most common/popular on this subreddit... Which is why I wanted to give some some observations from less known pairs.

As a breakdown between Unbranded (a N&amp;F sub-label, generally not as good of quality), Tellason, and Raleigh as follows:

**Price:** Unbranded, $80. Tellason, $200. Raleigh: $275-300.

**Jean production:** Unbranded made in Macau, China. Tellason: San Francisco. Raleigh: Raleigh NC.

**Denim Origion** 

Unbranded-- Unknown, low quality, heavily starched. Comes only in 14.75 ounce variety.

Tellason-- White Cone Mill, Greensboro, NC. Standard denim production, decently starched, high quality.

Raleigh-- White Cone Mill, Greensboro NC. possibly Less starch in production, with some Wax instead. Weft is unbleached cotton, giving it a cream-hue (as opposed to bleach white)

**Leather Patch**

Unbranded- Cheap, thin layer of leather that looks less durable than the denim.

Tellason-- Tanner Goods, Portland OR. Hgih quality hand-tanned leather.

Raleigh-- Source unknown, but similar quality to Tellason.

**Buttons and Rivettes**

Unbranded-- Source Unknown, obviously lower quality than Tellason, copper. Hidden rivets on back pockets, expect them to wear through (could look cool!)

Tellason- Tanner Goods, Portland OR. High quality copper, rivets shown ( I think) on front pockets. No hidden rivets to prevent bust-through (and scratching of leather couches, etc)

Raleigh-- Source unknown, BRONZE buttons of high quality. No hidden rivets.

**Stitching**

Unbranded-- Generous use of a Chain Stitch all over. Double-chain stitched on waist, inseam, outseam, and the butt. Single stitch on crotch-piece. 

Tellason-- Single chain stitch on waist, with a single stitch supporting. Chain stitched at hemline, and a single chain stitch for the inseam. 

Raleigh-- Uses red chain stitching on hem-line and waist, and a unique double chain stitch on the inseam that makes the two stitch-lines on the outside look awesome-- They are spaced tightly together, giving the jean a unique look. 


**Other Details**
Unbranded-- No markings indicating maker, which is kinda-neat. A single cloth un-labeled label on the back. Un-styled back pockets.

Tellason-- A very neat, plain looking pattern on the back pockets (but not overbearing).

Raleigh-- Back pocket has a slightly different shape-- The inside upper corners are lined differently. As previously mentioned:
Red chain-stitched hemline (only red on the inside, so perfect to cuff to show it off), and unbleached weft.



EDIT: I forgot an important detail about Unbranded: Their pockets are a bit small. My phone (AT&amp;T Galaxy S II) barely fits in a front pocket lengthwise, and it can be a bit uncomfortable to sit in. But it does force me to use the back pockets, and I already have a slight fade forming there from my wallet.

I've been wearing these Raleigh Original Thins for about 3 months. They haven't been washed yet at all. They were pretty tight in the upper block for the first few wears, but they fit awesome now. The construction of these is pretty awesome. They were my first raws, but I've seen quite a few brands now and these will hold up to just about anything.

I just picked up these Japan Blue 0701s today. I definitely didn't need them, but wanted to give them a shot when I found out I could grab a pair locally. They are a bit heavier than the Raleighs so they might not get a ton of wear this summer. It's pretty obvious they are made very well; I can't wait to break them in a bit before it gets too warm here.

I can try to get some fit pics of both of them at some point...I just can't find my tripod's camera mount at the moment. 

Gotta give a shoutout to Satchel at BlackBlue in St. Paul, MN (http://www.blkblu.com/). I've only known about the shop for 3 months or so, but I've already spent way too much money there. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out!

If you sign up for a new gustin account using this link

 &gt; [https://www.weargustin.com/invite_from/2018](https://www.weargustin.com/invite_from/2018)

You will get $25 off your first purchase of $80 or more [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caitll1?context=3)] and **I will get a $10 credit**. Your credit card will not be charged instantly, it will be charged the discounted amount when the campaign has enough backers.



The credit will not expire quickly [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caigl0n?context=3)] but no firm date is set on when it will expire. It is not permanent though and they will send you an email before it expires.



If you do not want me to get $10 then you can use this link

 &gt; [https://weargustin.com/invite_from/3](https://weargustin.com/invite_from/3) 

Which is straight from gustin [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caigl0n?context=3)]. That will give you $20 off and no one gets a kick back (because it is from gustin).

I made a little album just in case anyone was wondering about these, since I'm just assuming that Wranglers get a bad rep when one wanders up North a bit.  I think they're cool. They are a true slim straight fit, no flare but also no taper.  Anyway, here's the [album](http://imgur.com/a/Y9J4J#xax2znY).  Note the cool texture of the fabric.  Also, Wrangler does their outseam like others do their inseam, so that's the picture I included.

To explain the socks and sandals.. I had on wool socks and waterproof boots since it was cold and rainy out - took off the boots - had to take my dog outside - Chacos were much easier to slip on = socks and sandals.  Plus it's a pretty awesome look.  By the way, friend's dog chewed the hole in my couch.  Don't make fun, it's not nice.

tl;dr I like my cheap jeans

Got both on sale last month, around $50 each.

This is my first plunge into raw and I have a limited budget so this seemed like the way to go.

I wear a 33/32 in normal jeans or pants. 


**Levis 501 Shrink-To-Fit Selvedge**


I took others advice and ordered the Levis slightly large, at 34/34, since they are said to shrink. I knew that 501s are a bit baggier, but I really liked the fact that they are not low-rise.

When they arrived, I was a little scared at how big they were on me. I immediately soaked them, and they shrunk significantly, and the waist fit quite well. The legs, however, were pretty baggy still, and they were still too long for me.

I wore them for a couple weeks and then soaked them again to see if I could get them to shrink some more. They did, and the waist still fit, and the legs started to get a bit tighter as well, but still are baggier and longer than I'd like.

The quality of the jeans are better than I'm used to with cheap jeans, and the denim is comfortable.

Overall I'm happy with them, but wish they weren't quite so wide in the legs. Maybe they need a couple more soaks?


**Gap 1969 Straight Selvedge**


I bought these after the Levis, mostly to compare. The guy in the store told me that these tend to stretch, so don't buy them big. I bought my normal size 33/32. 

I soaked them immediately, but I don't think they shrunk at all. They did run a lot of dye though. In fact, these are turning my socks/shoes blue even after the soak, much more than the Levis did. Maybe I need to soak again?

They fit a lot better than my Levis, although the waist is a little loose. The cut is a lot more tapered in the legs, and a lot more appealing to me, and more comfortable as well. Unlike the Levis which I bought long, these are the right length without rolling. I can get away with a small roll if I want to.

I feel like the quality of the denim is not quite as good as the Levis, but I am no expert on this. At this point I enjoy wearing these more than the Levis, but only because they fit better.

I'll try to check back in a few months if they start to develop fades, and to provide a later review.

**EDIT1**
Will post pictures later!

Levis only had even numbered sizes, otherwise I'd have gone with a 33. I definitely should have gone with 32 length, even though they said they'd shrink 2 inches in length, that's not my experience.

For the Gap, I'd recommend going down a size in waist, as they do stretch quite a bit.

When somebody says ""Size down 1 for a ___ fit size down 2 for a ___ fit""
Do they mean size down 1 of the tagged waist size? or size down 1 from the actual waist size??
For instance I want to buy a pair of Samurai 710xx's. People say size down 1 and i've seen some people say size down 2 if you want a really tight fit but beware. 
My waist is size 34'

Tag Size 31= 32'

Tag Size 32= 33'

Tag Size 33= 34'

Tag Size 34= 35'

Does saying ""size down 1"" mean grab the Tag size 32 (actual 33')?? or ""size down 1"" to a tag size 33 (actual 34') considering my waist is a 34.

I've always wondered how their jeans would be, as their products have been nothing but quality. I looked at their different fits and settled on their [""Two Jeans""](http://www.norseprojects.com/store/spring13/jeans/two-jeans-n30-0002), described as having a ""low rise and fit slim and straight all the way to the bottom"". They're classic 5 pocket, 13.5oz indigo/[white selvedge](http://i.imgur.com/i0KRb7i.jpg) denim. The Norse Store was having a sale and when I saw the Two's under the ""for sale"" category, I had to jump!

The package shows up yesterday, and as I take out the jeans, they feel solid. A lot more solid than other pairs I've owned. The [heavy duty stitching](http://i.imgur.com/6lDlfDA.jpg), [canvas pockets](http://i.imgur.com/lPJlN3K.jpg) and overall rigidity made them feel extremely well-made. Not to mention the classic Norse Projects ""We Hope This Makes Your Day"" card is there, which makes me smile every time.

As for [the fit](http://i.imgur.com/wSHbCJQ.jpg), I could not be more pleased. I purchased the 28x32, which is tight, but not uncomfortably so. They feel like they will stretch nicely. They're [straight](http://i.imgur.com/0b7hDfb.jpg) and [skinny](http://i.imgur.com/Cri9qfX.jpg) from thigh to ankle which is exactly how I like 'em.

They just feel like they're made to fade nicely and hold up well. The canvas pockets are so thick, you can see where they may possibly even create fades. They're already starting to develop whiskers around the fly. Cannot wait to see how they look after some solid wear!

My latest two buys.  Thanks to /u/raisin_bran_in for the heads up on the sale from Need Supply Co. where I got these Momos for $180.

Thoughts on jeans:

* Fantastic construction and great denim

* Still really tight and hopefully will loosen up

* Worst indigo bleed of any pair of denim I've owned


I performed a warm soak on the jeans yesterday hoping to soften up to denim to let it expand quicker.  Already they're feeling much better after about 1h of wear.  However after soaking for about an hour last night I noticed even the water splash on my walls from taking them out of the tub and hanging them was leaving indigo all over my walls.

Wallet:

* Great quality leather.  Very soft.

* Construction appears stellar

* Still unsure if it popping out of my pocket is a good look

* Still unsure on the leather chain

How are jeans tailored that are made with selvedge denim?

The inside is hard to do though, and my tailor doesn't have the right specialized equipment (it's apparently using a technique called french ____?). Any tailors here that can provide help on their process?

I have been offered a different pair if they have any in my size but the question is where are those jeans coming from? Returns?

It seems like the top male brands of denim have women lines, but they always have elastane in them.  Is that just what I have to live with, or do the ladies here just wear men's cuts?

I placed a order with A.P.C on March 31st, and paid for 3-5 day shipping (up to Canada). The difference is $11, which isn't a lot, but still adds up. I was supposed to receive this package last Friday, April 5th, and sitting here now I am still no where near receiving my package. 

I was just on the phone with Canada Post and they told me two things which really infuriated me. The first, which is what I think is the worst is, it was shipped with ground. I am not entirely sure how long that shipping is actually supposed to take, but the lady assured me it is no where near the time of I had originally paid for. So they're pocketing that extra money that I put out for shipping. Secondly, the projected date for it to arrive isn't till NEXT Thursday the 18th. I am going to be going on vacation to L.A that day, and won't be able to receive the package. I was also informed that there is $53 of duty attached to this package.

I have received zero responses to the three, now four as I am typing this, emails that I have sent. So with all that being said, I will be returning these jeans, and cutting my ties with A.P.C. I have been wearing them for four years, and have recommended these jeans to so many different people. 

I just wanted to warn people as to what could happen to you if you order through their website.

On a different note, since I will be in L.A what are some denim shops I could go to to get some jeans. I was thinking of Railcar Fine Goods, but it's a tad bit out of L.A.

But I just realised that over time I'm going to (hopefully) be gaining, so would it be a safer bet to get a 34""?

Or is it really worth it at all? The main aspect of raw denim (apart from the fades) I'm drawn to is the longevity, and if I'm going to be gaining should I wait? I really don't have the cash to be putting $250 into a pair of jeans that will only last me 6 months or so.

My thoughts/review. ,12,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/11il88/picked_up_a_pair_of_unbranded_ub106_skinny_raw/,"I'm pretty new to the raw/selvedge jeans and the pricing of the Unbranded denim seemed very appealing.  I have a pair of grey levi's that have seen better days so I decided to replace them with [this](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=19141134&amp;parentid=M_BOTTOMS) pair of Unbranded jeans from Urban Outfitters.

The UO site lists these jeans as the UB101 model but the tag on the inside of the jeans says UB106.  I'm pretty sure it's the same skinny cut, just a different color.  UO also says the grey skinny's are 13.5 oz but they are tagged as 14.5 oz.  Either way, they feel heavy. 

Fit pics:  [Front](http://imgur.com/a1Zjc) [Side](http://imgur.com/mUPm1) -Bonus laser cat!

I haven't seen any pictures, mine included, that do the color justice.  It's a very nice deep grey, almost silver.  Almost makes the jeans look a little dressy.  I think the color will only get better as they fade out.

My thoughts:  I normally wear 511's and my size is 30x32.  All of the info I saw online said that these run small so I ordered them in a 31"" waist.  At 31 the Unbranded definitely fit tighter than my 511's.  The advice to size up 1-2 sizes is spot on.  I'm hoping mine stretch out 0.5"".  A lot of people said the pockets are shallow and this was also accurate. They are a little shallow, but it hasn't been a problem.  My iPhone fits in the pockets fine so I'm OK with it.  The hardware, stitching, fabric quality all seem to be top notch and comparable to what I've seen in the N&amp;F Skinny Guy.  Fit also seems to be the same as the N&amp;F Skinny Guy.

Overall I'm very happy with the jeans.  I don't think the grey is going to give me super high contrast fades but I'm eager to see how these wear.  I'm for sure going to cop a pair of the 20+ oz UB101's when they come out this fall.  

I had trouble finding info on these jeans so I thought I would share my experiences for the next guy.  ",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_11il88,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/11il88/picked_up_a_pair_of_unbranded_ub106_skinny_raw/,

Excuse the awkward poses... no idea how to get the jeans to look normal. I don't normally tuck my shirt in but I wanted to show the jeans in how they would naturally sit.

I've been wearing these 3 pairs of jeans for a while. Basically I've always had a huge ass and big thighs. Recent leg gainz has only made it worse so I think it's time to retire these beasts and find one or two new pairs. 


Does anyone have any suggestions? Can you tell from the pictures where I need to increase in size? For me it feels like the thighs/crotch are really tight. The indigo ones have shrunk and not stretched back out (probably due to a ton of crotch repairs) and don't have much mobility anymore. I haven't worn them out in a long time.

All three are Naked and Famous size 32 Weird Guy. The indigo pair have maybe a year's worth of wear on them, a few soaks and 1 or 2 washes. The red weft pair have probably 6 months of wear on them and one soak. The black pair doesn't have much wear on it and hasn't been washed or soaked.

Would a sized up pair of weird guys fit better? Maybe a slim guy? I have also been thinking of trying a pair of SL-100x or SL-120x to see if they would fit in the thighs. FWIW I'm in Edmonton, Alberta and there isn't the greatest selection of shops to try stuff on at but I'll do what I can.

**TL;DR** Looking for a fit check/suggestions for a new pair or two. Took a bunch of awkward pictures with an iphone.

* I expected them to be rigid and painful for a while.  They are rigid, sure, but I think they must remove some of the starch, because they felt great on right away.  The slack weave really helps too,  they are really pretty airy for 21oz denim and I see no issues with them being a year-round jean.  They also have sort of a stretchy quality thanks to the slack weave.  I really love the material, best denim I've worn, and I look forward to it softening further over time.

* The fit is great.  I'm 5'10 170, usually wear 32, this is 33 TTS and it looks really good.  I lift weights and can't imagine moving to a Beatle Buster or Devil's Cut and fitting my legs in though.  After all the talk of how big the leg openings are I feared some goucho-pants, but even on my average frame with developed, but not ridiculously huge, legs and glutes they are plenty slim for me.

* If there is a complaint for me, it's that the construction isn't as robust as I'd have hoped.  My previous favorite pair of jeans were some selvage Rag &amp; Bones that are so beautifully constructed, herringbone cotton liner, really big back and front pockets, triple-stitched inseam and seat...  They are built like a tank.  I would hope for interior selvage detail on the fly and triple stitching on such a premium jean.  If they made a triple stitched, lined variant with big pockets in this denim it would be the PERFECT jean for someone like me, who buys stuff to last.  I don't know that the back pockets need lining given the weight of the denim though.


Bottom line, if you've been considering this jean I would give it a go.  I really love them.

He also gave me some insight on my busted ass pair of APCs and said he probably could fix them, so I sent them his way.  I just got them back today, and the work he did was impressive!  I'm really happy with how they came out.  For those with some raw denim that is starting to show some rips and tears here or there, definitely nip it in the bud and get the areas fixed.

Having perused the FAQ and the basic guide to raw denim I’ll (hopefully avoid) asking truly basic questions. I mostly wanted to post because I’m leaving for a 2 and a half week trip to Japan in two days and I plan to hit up (at least) Hinoya (any/all of the 3?) and Americaya in Ameyoko (Ueno) and also the Pure Blue store in Harajuku while I’m in Tokyo to try to pick up my first 2 − 4 pairs of raw selvedge denim jeans. My goal is to pick up a few pairs (a couple indigo, maybe one gray and one black?) that will be distinctive, high quality, and long-lasting to replace my standby regular old Levi’s 514s that I wear now. Was just wondering if any other denizens here had tips for me. Currently I plan to go home and measure a couple of my best-fitting pairs of Levi’s as per the Blue in Green sizing guide to get a sense for what kinds of measurements I should be looking for.

Questions:

Should I take a little tape measure with me to measure jeans in the stores? I’m worried about the language barrier here, since my Japanese is extremely rudimentary.

Is it worth going to more than one of the Hinoya stores? Is the selection different enough between the stores? Are there other stores not on my list that would be good picks?

Should I go for sanforized/one-wash jeans since it’ll probably be a little difficult to do an initial soak on several pairs of jeans while I’m traveling? I guess the benefit would be that I could instantly start wearing a pair (or two?) while I’m traveling without having to worry about serious shrinking whenever I do get around to actually washing them the first time.

Thanks for any tips you can give.

I promise to keep detailed photo album cataloging my experience from week 1 forward.  I'll post updates every so often (but not too often, because that would be boring).

I'm ~5'7.5'', ~125lbs, and ~28 waist.  Finding good clothes in my size at the right price is near impossible these days, as I'm sure it is for many other people on this fringe of the weight/size spectrum (I've seen a few posts about this in MFA).  So I searched long and hard to find good raw denim that fit my measurements.

I didn't really want to order APC after seeing some horror stories about the side seams coming undone.  I didn't want to order unbranded because it felt too common- if anything, I knew I'd be posting here so I wanted to be able to contribute by looking at something that others have not worn, and perhaps they could be interested in in the future.

I was so excited when I finally found [a pair of jeans](http://www.gilt.com/brand/scotch-soda/product/175029292-scotch-soda-dean-raw-denim) I could get down with on Gilt.  They were marked down from $246 to $119 and I used a 20% off coupon to make the cost even better (you can try gilt20 or 20gilt to see if it still works...).

It doesn't say on Gilt, but the cut is ""Loose Taper"", according to the tag.  They definitely feel pretty snug, so I'm not sure if they're just cut wrong and that's why they're on Gilt or if I just didn't expect them to taper that much.  I usually like to wear Express 28 fitted, and I'd say that they're quite a bit tighter toward the bottom of the legs than I am used to.  The crotch is very spacious, which is great, because I hate having my balls crushed by pants (curse you Dockers 28 slim!).

Now, the detail on these pants is awesome.  I know it's kind of the thing for good pairs of raw denim to have decoration, but this is new to me, so [I took a whole bunch of photos of the details I liked](http://blog.zachadamsis.me/post/45630540603/details-matter).

^^Photos ^^taken ^^with ^^a ^^Pentax ^^K-7 ^^+ ^^Pentax ^^100mm ^^FA ^^WR ^^f/2.8 ^^Macro ^^and ^^color/brightness ^^corrected ^^in ^^Lightroom ^^4.3, ^^if ^^anyone ^^wants ^^to ^^know.

Anyways that's about it, I soaked them yesterday and started wearing them today.  I ordered a wider belt to fit the **massive belt loops** (which measured ~2.5'') and I plan on wearing them with [these sweet Ferragamo chukkas](http://i.imgur.com/Q0JnG57.jpg) I got in my best thrift find ever.

I'll keep you all posted on how it goes, I'm excited for this journey I'm about to embark on.

My problem is that I can't understand how the thigh measurements are applied. For example, I'm looking at Naked and Famous 13 Oz Weird Guys from Blue Owl (link at the end cause hyperlinking isn't working for me right now). The dimensions listed as something like this...
&gt;Size 34 (36"" waist, 10.5"" rise, 12.5"" thigh, 9"" knee, 35"" inseam, 8"" leg opening). 

Is thigh opening supposed to be circumference or diameter? And where is it measured from on the thigh?

Please help me find the perfect pair! If entry level is out of the question, I'll pay whatever it takes to make this work, but it's my first real pair of denim so I'd prefer to screw up with a less expensive pair. Please note that I live in NYC, so I can go window shopping if you think that's a better choice.

**Fit:** My best fitting pair is no longer made, and I'm not sure exactly what it is. From the label, I know these things: 100% cotton, ""chuckin slim"" converse by varvatos. It's very lightweight and feels a bit stretchy. My only complaint is that the rise is a tad short and I'd like the opening to be smaller.

Here are the measurements of the best fitting pair with some notes on fit:

* Label Waist = **31.0""** (also what I wear in Levi's true-to-size) 

* True Waist = 34.5"" (hard to measure due to age / stretchiness)

* Front rise = 10.5"" but should go up to **10.75""**

* Thighs = 22.0"" but they stretch.

* Actual Body's Thighs = **24.25""** with jeans on, 23.25"" with jeans off

* Knee **8.25""**

* Opening = 15.0"" but want to come down to **14.5""**

* Inseam **32.5""**

**Style:** I live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and I'd self-describe as a [Yupster](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yupster). Denim is just one of those things I never quite got. I'd say the truly ""skinny jean"" look is a little beyond me, but slim and slim straight, or Levi 508 &amp; 520-stretch work just fine in my style. The only real killer is that having my pants skin-tight against my thighs makes me look ridiculous.

I have just recently gotten into raw denim. And while, philosophically, I love it, the break-in can be a bit of a pain in the ass. And biking with raw denim is not a lot of fun. For instance, my first pair are UB201s, and while they fit great when I am just walking, sitting can be uncomfortable and biking is downright impossible right now. I found a [blogpost on rawrdenim](http://www.rawrdenim.com/2012/09/5-more-raw-jeans-for-cyclists/), but they are (a) oldish and (b) none of the jeans are available in Germany (which is where I am from). Plus my thighs are fairly big (no Greipel but I don't skip leg day), so finding jeans that fit is a bit of challenge anyways.

So, can my desire for moving freely and my fascination with raw denim be reconciled? Would, for instance, the Weird Guy Stretch Denim be a good choice for me?

So I have been really getting into this raw denim thing lately. I started with a pair of STF 501s and moved on to a pair of UB101s. 

I just got the 101s back from a tailor because I needed to have them slimmed for a better fit, pics coming soon.

My next step is a pair of shadows or indigo/indigo because I really love the color of the ones I have seen.

I understand why someone would pay $200+ for a handmade item similar to the ones in [this post](http://imgur.com/a/jkxBu#0)

But for the major brands that everyone talks about, when walking down the street, is there any visual difference to someone who isn't a denim head that passes you?

Aren't they all just dark wash jeans in cuts that are basically the same as what you can get for much less in a box store like H&amp;M or Gap?

Does a $200 pair last twice as long as a $100 pair or will I get twice as many people asking where I got those amazingly well fitting and obviously expensive pants?

Don't get me wrong, I understand the hobby and spending a lot on a pair that will fade specifically to your body, but to the average Joe who has never heard of PBJ or 3sixteen, will a $300 pair look better than a $80-$100 pair?

**ABOUT EACH PAIR**  

Being a Minnesota native, I decided to head over to [BlackBlue](http://blakblu.blogspot.com) in Saint Paul this past weekend. I had heard about the store a few times, once through the Minneapolis Star Tribune in an article about raw denim, and again when it was made known that they sold [Justin Vernon the suit he wore at the 2012 Grammy's](https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/13/1329115004145/Justin-Vernon-aka-Bon-Ive-007.jpg).  

I had an entire afternoon to myself, so I spent about four hours in the store trying on nearly every cut of jeans they sell. Satchel Moore and Steve Kang, manager and owner respectively, are both very cool dudes. I was mostly helped by Satchel, and we shot the figurative denim shit for a few hours while I fitted everything from Tellason to Japan Blue.  

I debated over APC, Baldwin, Tellason and Raleigh for a while and ended up going with the first two. APC, while I know they get scrutinized for quality and durability, produce some amazing fades (Satchel has a pair of 18-month APCs on display in the store. They're insane). Baldwin because I have family ties in Kansas City, and it's always been an unsung home for me.  

If you're anywhere near BlackBlue for any amount of time, go there. Satchel offers free chain stitch hemming for denim bought in-store ($25 otherwise) and he mentioned the possibility of offering darning repair in the coming months.  

The Levi's 501s were a birthday gift from December. I've worn many pairs of 501s and thought I could shrink down a 30x36 to fit more like how a 29x36 might. Nope. So I took matters into my own hands and modeled them after my 29x34 pair. I ended up taking them in a lot more than I anticipated, but I kind of accidentally stumbled upon a really nice fit. They stretched out in the rear, which sucks because I'm minus an ass. They also are getting a small blowout because of the tailoring (and re-tailoring) I did.  

Overall I'm really excited to start wearing these jeans. I'll probably cycle them so it could be a while before I see any real noticeable fades.

One thing I am having trouble adjusting to is the size of the leg opening. I don't mind the relaxed feel of the straight cut leg (it's actually what I wanted) but what I do mind is the way these stack with basically anything but boots. Because the leg opening is wide they drape over any sneakers and look more like a boot cut rather than stacking.

I'm hoping that as the denim relaxes this will become less apparent but must say I'm considering having them taken in .25 to .5 of an inch at the hem / leg opening.

1. talk me out of it
2. has anyone done this?
3. do you think they will stack better as the denim relaxes?

The craftsmanship on these jeans is amazing. The inside stitching just looks perfect and I know no tailor in Australia will be able to match that factory quality so I may be compromising the construction. However as it's inside stitching in a low wear part of the jean chances are not much.

*****

I thought this was fun to make (did it about a month ago, right before my jeans came), and it's nice hanging my jeans on something of my own creation. The hanger supports them well, doesn't stretch or warp the belt-loops, doesn't rub off anywhere, and it's easy to hang my jeans up and take them down. All that said, I can't recommend a similar design unless you're cool with the... Unpolished... Appearance. I'm just hanging them in my closet, not to display, so I don't mind it. Sharing just for fun and who knows, maybe someone will make something similar. (Sadly no progress pictures, but it's not the most complicated of DIY projects.)

[**Final Product**](http://i.imgur.com/Hgdg3y6.jpg)

I couldn't sleep one night and decided I needed a hanger for my soon-to-arrive denim (jeans are the [3sixteen ST-211](http://www.3sixteen.com/products/st-211-slim-tapered-overdyed-black-denim) by the way). I'd seen the [Self Edge hangers](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yLvrYuQy2oE/TkRtH6UTh1I/AAAAAAAARVw/FQNUVclWu5w/s1600/Selfedge-1.jpg) as well as other people's interpretations and creations and knew I wanted to make something similar. I considered just cutting and bending a single wire hanger, but the thin ones were too flimsy and the thickest one I have would be difficult to manipulate. I decided to cut three thin ones and bind them together.

I began with three hangers like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QSouzrF.jpg), and used a handheld branch clipper like [this](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/suchatbky/suchatbky1210/suchatbky121000036/15824863-shears--branch-clipper.jpg) to cut each one about [here](http://i.imgur.com/DGl7gGQ.jpg) (the left side looks shorter just because of how it's tilted). I eyeballed the length of the ""arms"" and it came out close enough. I then lined up the three cut hangers on top of each other and used pliers to curve the arms, all three at a time. Instead of needle-nose pliers, I used pliers with a shorter and wider end, similar to [these](http://www.wholesalelighting.co.uk/images/thumbs/0006510_256.jpeg). The wire bent easily. I felt the additional surface area helped and made it require much less muscle. It took awhile to get the curves somewhat symmetrical, and you can tell they're still a bit off. As long as they were close enough to not affect how the jeans sat I didn't mind.

At this point, I had three cut and bent wire hangers, like white, less pretty, baby Self Edge hangers. Keeping them all lined up was already annoying and I knew I needed to set them somehow, at least a bit, before binding them. (Otherwise I'd end up with a misaligned, bumpy hanger.) The solution? [These](http://i.imgur.com/UbegciI.jpg?1). If you've ever had braces (or you're an orthodontist, who knows), you might have used them. I had a ton of leftovers from back when I did have braces. Regular rubber bands required too much doubling back and weren't really helping. When I put one on, it would keep that single spot on the hangers together but, not being held anywhere else they would spread out and be even harder to manage and align. Kind of like [this](http://img1.photographersdirect.com/img/14637/wm/pd481326.jpg), if you see the comparison. The orthodontic elastics worked great. I must have put at least 50 on. I held the arms together and slid/rolled each one up the body of the hanger until there were so many and they were so spread out that the three hangers together kept a hanger shape. 

I still wanted to cover it though. The bands aren't the strongest and were meant more as a guide than a final binding. I have some extra-strength masking tape (it really is quite strong) at my house, so I just went crazy and mummified it. I was careful to preserve the shape and add padding of sorts at the ends of the arms and end of the hook. There are at least two or three layers throughout, and I made sure there were no holes. I also pulled the tape as tight as possible to avoid shifting of the multiple hangers inside. 

Masking tape makes for a poor surface on anything, plus I didn't want any stickiness touching my jeans, so I plastic wrapped it all. Again, multiple layers everywhere (the parts that don't look wrapped - the left arm, mainly - are just still smooth and stuck down). At first it looked nice-ish, like a poorly done lacquer job. Eventually, as the static of the wrap wore off and general wear from the jeans being pulled off, it grew a lot messier. 

I also made [a hook](http://i.imgur.com/ggISwAr.jpg) that was really... Resourceful..? I wanted some clearance from the wall so the jeans could breathe and wouldn't get dusty, and also a hook wide enough for the thick hanger. I should have drilled a hole and set up something nicer, but it was the middle of the night and people were sleeping. And I'm impatient. I used rubber cement to secure a long, thin nail inside the thick cylindrical piece visible, after I'd hammered that piece through the top hole in my ""hook"" and added elastics to keep it in place (visible in [this](http://i.imgur.com/KrEgSU6.jpg) side view, along with overflowed rubber cement). Bending that thing into a hook with pliers (one in each hand; didn't have access to a clamp) did a number on my hands but it now fits my fat hanger well. After the piece was put together it was easy to tap it into the wall, since the nail itself is pretty thin. Plenty strong for a load of a pound or two though. [This](http://i.imgur.com/CHGB0HL.jpg?1) side view shows the slight dip caused by the jeans. Still enough clearance that, facing the wall, only the knees graze it, which I like.

Finally, some [glamour shots](http://imgur.com/tl0IVoh&amp;Y83WnbZ&amp;qoOsR7b&amp;4K3U2fs&amp;LIG3tWd#0). And the [**full album of all the pictures I took**](http://imgur.com/Hgdg3y6&amp;ggISwAr&amp;KrEgSU6&amp;CHGB0HL&amp;tl0IVoh&amp;Y83WnbZ&amp;qoOsR7b&amp;4K3U2fs&amp;LIG3tWd) (for TL;DR people)

All in all, it took about an hour and a half if I had guess, but I was tired and didn't care at all about efficiency. You could do something similar, probably better, in about 20 minutes, and you could probably do it with stuff you already have lying around, like I did. Most people don't have tiny elastics available, but you could use another method to keep them lined up before binding.

I know this isn't directly denim related and it's kind of silly, but it's what's worked for me and I hope you all enjoy it. Cheers!

Is this to be expected?,9,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1a8mmx/stitching_coming_undoneother_damage_on_my/,"So I purchased my first pair of raw denim jeans ([3Sixteen+ 21BSPs](http://i.imgur.com/rhXzPNA.jpg)) about 1.5 years ago and have worn them more or less every day since then. They were cold water soaked once when purchased and hand washed once about a year ago. 

About 6 months ago I noticed the stitching along the fly start to come undone. I did my own hack job of repairing the seam and carried on. [Picture of the repaired seam](http://i.imgur.com/YmjyNwo.jpg?1).

Since then several other issues have popped up:

* [Top button came off (repaired with solder)](http://i.imgur.com/2GDaQMO.jpg?1)

* [Pocket bags ripped](http://i.imgur.com/jlEMdik.jpg)

* [Stitching around fly button hole unravelling](http://i.imgur.com/FQUpeau.jpg?1)

* [Crotch stitching came undone (another hack repair job that is itself coming undone)](http://i.imgur.com/R9igE4Y.jpg?1)

Is this kind of wear and tear to be expected? How common is it for stitching to come undone? Could this be caused by a bad fit and/or too much dirt buildup in the fibers?

My main reason for asking is that I'm in the market for a new pair and although I love the fit of the 3Sixteen+s, I might switch to another brand if they seem to come undone as quickly as mine have. 

Like I said, this is my first pair and I have no knowledge if this is normal or not, so please lend me your experience!

(I live in Vancouver, so I've seen the sun maybe 4 times in the past month). This is also my first post, so mind the editing if I don't do this properly the first time!

I am about 5'6, 165 lbs., play hockey, football, and run a lot, so finding the right fit for my fluctuating thighs has always been a #1 concern for me. My waist is about a 30-31, but I find that irrelevant if my thighs/ass don't fit. 

I picked these up at the Dutil Vancouver location and asked them for help in sizing regarding my larger thighs. I first tried on the A.P.C. Petit Standards, which were perfect in the thighs, but the straight fit from the knee down made them look too baggy for my height. Then they told me that the Naked &amp; Famous Weird Guys had a similar fit, but with a more tapered leg, which was perfect! She then ended up giving me a collaboration pair with IDC (International Design Collaborative, a brand from Toronto), which I thought was pretty cool considering it's signed by both Brandon Svarc and IDC, has a unique patch, and is limited to 50 pairs worldwide.

[Here's a link for more info on the collaboration,](http://blog.dutildenim.com/2012/08/12/idc-x-naked-famous-pre-order-now/) and [some more photos of em in store,](http://blog.dutildenim.com/2012/08/22/nf-x-idc-just-arrived-in-vancouver/) and [a shot of the jeans from the IDC Facebook page!](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/66544_168325039957750_1238826514_n.jpg)

I managed to fit my thighs into a size 32 and they fit me like a glove. I know the waist will stretch out quite a bit more, but I wear a belt and as long as my thighs have enough room, I'll be comfy. These jeans also don't hug my calves as much as my Nudie's did, which I am totally fine with seeing as muscular legs in tight denim isn't a good luck! So far it's been 2 months of daily wear and no washes, and I am loving the fit and the way these are turning out, which makes documenting them even more fun.

I've noticed significant wear in my left front pocket where I keep my Samsung Galaxy SIII, my coin pocket where I keep my chapstick, and my back left pocket where I keep my wallet. The whiskers, honeycombs, and crotch region show quite a bit of contrast in the sun which I like. Another cool thing is that I found that my jeans had dyed my phone case green!

So I just bought my first pair of high quality jeans from SelfEdge 2 and half weeks ago. Thought people would like to know how I thought about them. One thing I should mention is that I'm a really tough critic. A good article about my views can be found here: http://dcurt.is/the-best

The first thing which I'd like to mention is the stitching. There are two places where I can pinpoint problems, one of which might be me being too harsh. Two weeks wearing my 3sixteens, one week with not much movement due to Hurricane Sandy and I find this business going on:
http://i.imgur.com/Q3cnX.jpg
Maybe this isn't a big deal, but it is annoying to look at every time I hang my jeans up. I'd expect these things to happen but at a much later time of wear. If anyone knows what I should do with it, that'd be great.
Another stitching problem which I couldn't take a picture with is in the back pockets. The stitching in the back pocket sticks out real rough to the touch. Every time I'm reaching for my wallet my knuckles get a sharp nick reaching in and out of my back pocket. Lately I've been finding myself using my thumb and mid finger to claw my wallet from the sides in order to not sink my hands in the jeans. Maybe it will loosen up after more wears but for now, it is something which has been noticeably annoying.

Weird crease: http://i.imgur.com/RXay0.jpg
Not sure why this is happening to my pair, does it mean that the jeans are tight? I sized around one down which was recommended. I find myself always uncreasing this triangular crossover but it just doesn't want to listen.

The fit on the jeans is great, a little tight to begin. It was tough to tie my shoes from the start but is slowly getting easier. The denim feels strong, I feel that the crotch won't give up anytime soon. As of now, are these jeans the perfect pair of jeans? It's too early for me to tell. I shouldn't have a long term opinion on a two week old purchase. 

This is my two week. Many more to come.

Anyways, I got these Thinn Finns for christmas two years ago but never wore them. I didnt like the fit and just didnt like Nudie, to be honest. I had found that I could beat up a pair of cheap mondays or 510's in a similar way over a year or so like I did to my Slim Kims, and for a fraction of the price. But what the hell, they were a gift so I was stoked. First thing I did was have them tapered a bit more (I'm skinny), and removed the stitching from the back pockets. First impression was that the denim and quality of these was not as good as what I remembered, but whatever.

I was hoping to go a while longer before washing these, but I got caught in the rain here in Korea a few times, and it seemed like the smell from the subway seats was transferring to the jeans (gross). So yeah, here they are after

r/rawdenim, I have a pair of [Tellason John Graham Mellor 14.75oz](http://tellason.com/shop/tellason-denim/john-graham-mellor-1475-oz-0) jeans that I've been breaking in for about three and a half months now. They're not my first pair of raw denim, as I've also had a pair of [APC New Standards](http://www.contextclothing.com/item.php?id=6) and [Baldwin Henleys](http://shop.baldwindenim.com/product/the-henley).

I added the Tellason's because my APCs were pretty worn in with &gt;1 year of wear with no wash and a crotch blowout repaired by me. The Baldwin's are great but are a much slimmer cut so get much less wear because they're not as versatile as the straighter cuts of the APCs or the Tellasons.

My question has to deal with something I've only experienced with the Tellasons: dye bleeding into my clothes. Most notably bleeding onto my shoes (very noticable on sneakers), undershirts and my canvas messenger bag that rubs my jeans as I walk.

I want to keep the Tellasons dark and wear them much, much longer before washing for the fades but I feel like the dye bleeding is becoming too much of an issue to ignore. I'm wondering if washing them now is the right thing to do. Will it correct the problem of dye bleeding? Is it a better choice than waiting longer to get some better fades?

Thanks for your advice!

tl;dr: Tellasons are bleeding into my shoes and clothes a lot after 3.5 months of wear (has been a problem since day 1) and I'm wondering if washing them now outweighs the benefits of letting them go much longer without washing for better fades.",,False,,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,t3_r4zon,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/r4zon/raw_denim_dye_leaking_to_shoes_clothes_question/,

These pictures are after a couple days of wear. The quality of the denim and the construction are superb. They felt nice and crisp out of the package, but not too rigid.

They are made from 12.5oz Japanese denim, a nice weight if you want to wear them in warm weather. I am overall very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this brand to anyone looking for something a little more high quality than Unbranded. These jeans feel like they will last quite a long time.

Unfortunately it seems all the brands everyone here seems to talk about mostly only go to 36 or 38. I'm still losing and hope to get down to at least a 36, but I'm not losing nearly as fast as I was and that might take a while.

So... Should I just wait? Just make due with some ordinary levi's or something in the meantime? If I invest hundreds of dollars in a pair of jeans now that is a 40, will I be able to shrink them enough to still fit if I get down to a 38 or 36?

As I am sure you all have seen Naked and Famous' F/W 2013 line, the Okayama Spirit jeans caught my eye. The jean is interestingly being offered in the Super Skinny Guy cut, which is a very strongly tapered cut.

* Which pair of jeans from which manufacturers is Naked and Famous trying to compete with?

* Do any of the higher end manufacturers (Momotaro, Pure Blue Japan, Samurai, etc.) offer something like this?

I am aware that many of the Japanese brands offer cuts in similar material, but that these cuts are not very tapered, resembling more of a slim tapered jean rather than a skinny jean. The price point will likely be extremely competitive, judging by Naked and Famous' pricing history.

Should I size up or down? I typically wear size 31 waist. theunbrandedbrand.com says the 101s in a 31 waist are actually 31.5 in, which would be fine.

Should I go for the 101s in the 14.5 oz or 21 oz? The 21 oz seem better because I imagine they will be more durable. Will they be unbearably hot in the summer?

She has a point. So, I figured, why not use this chance to get a pair of overalls. Looked around, found that Osh Kosh doesn't make overalls for men anymore, and that high-end overalls cost ~$250-300 like any pair of good raw denim (currently wearing a pair of Raleighs, and they are oh so worth it). 

Pointer Brand looked promising, but didn't really want the zipper bib. I liked the tailored cut pair, but unfortunately those only come in pre-washed. Should let them know that their target demographic would prefer raw.

Found Round House, which apparently has been making jeans and overalls in the states for ""110 years"" and they are raw, and dirt cheap at $40. They are ~~14~~ *12* oz sanforized denim. I'd say they come pretty stiff, once washed at most, So, wtf, bought a pair. Now they suggest getting them 4"" larger in the waist than you normally wear. Well, that might work for how some people wear them, or if you have a large belly, but I'll say for me, ~~TTS~~ *usual denim sizing, like my Levi's STF, 514s, and Raleigh's* worked perfectly. They have side buttons, and I like the look and feel of leaving the top side button undone. I got them a little bit long, 30x36, and yeah, they either need to stay cuffed or get hemmed (maybe both).

Which gets to the stitching. Chain stitched details on the bib, but lock stitch everywhere else. Triple stitched inseam and outseam. The legs fit... big. Like really big, 501 STF before they are shrunk big. But these are sanforized, so they may be hopeless in that regard. 

Some nice detailing, button fly, lots of pockets (including a cell phone pocket, tool pocket, two deep waist pockets, hammer loop, butt pockets, and chest pockets. The left chest pocket has an interesting access, and the logo buttons on the chest are snaps. Lots of red bar tacks at stress points. White contrast stitches look nice.

Detailing issues: Would be nice if the Round House buttons were properly aligned (some are riveted in upside down). The stitches usually have barely finished ends. Lock stitched hem.

All in all, for $40, these are a steal, especially if you are willing to taper the legs a little bit. For a pair of work horse overalls, with a raw touch, these are pretty damn good.

I found these at a thrift shop, I only picked them up because I thought I had heard of this brand while browsing /r/MFA and they also had a pretty cool fit when I tried them on. When I got home I was surprised to see these are $220 jeans, I paid 5 bucks.

The tag on these say 32 but it looks like someone tried to stretch the waist out because they measure 34"". Truth is I don't like wearing indigo jeans, even though these would fit great if I could get the waist to shrink an inch.

I'm probably going to put them on eBay because the expense and ""quality"" of these is just lost on me, I'm fine wearing twenty dollar 501's I get at to TJMax.

Just wanted to share my find with the denim crew.

Today was the day:  I went to [the local denim purveyors](http://www.bears-shimokita.com/) with a fist full of cash ready to drop on my first pair of NICE denim.  Or so I thought.  I tried on about 4 pairs of jeans and all them were ridiculously **uncomfortable**.  

Full Counts 14 oz and 17 oz, Samurais and Sugar Canes.  As soon as I had struggled to put them on, I couldn't wait to take them off.  Which was even more of a struggle.  They were unbelievably stiff, tight, and basically unforgiving.  

I put my 2 year old, countlessly washed 501s back on, hung my head in shame and went to look at Edwins in Shinjuku.  

Is this normal for a first time raw/heavy weight denim experience?  If I buy a pair, will they soften up and not bring my heart beat above 180 bpm when removing them from my body?  *Will I be able to walk?*

TL;DR:  went to buy my first pair of awesome jeans today and hated the weight/stiffness, wat do?

However, there are some things that are unclear to me as far as the sizing is concerned.

From what I understand, 3Sixteen's straight-fitting jeans are, in actuality, slim-fitting. (They call it a ""modern cut."") This leads me to believe that their slim-tapered jeans are *really* skinny. I have no real point of reference, though, because [the pictures available on their official website look pretty much identical.](http://i.imgur.com/JQ6S2Fe.png)

Ideally, I'd like to purchase the slim-tapered jeans. However, I'm afraid that they'll be too tight. That said, I'm a skinny person and I have the feeling that if the slim-tapered jeans are too skinny for me, they're too skinny for anybody. I typically consider myself a **28(W)x32(L)**.

Whats going on you ask?  Well, [tea bags are hung down the legs of the jeans](http://i.imgur.com/21wTOh.jpg) when the jeans are not in use in order to absorb unwanted odors.  

**How to make.**

Materials - [2x S Hooks/hangers, some string, teabags.](http://i.imgur.com/3ItXYh.jpg)

1) [Take your string and tie a loop.](http://i.imgur.com/rPsZfh.jpg)

2) [Use the S-hangers and hang your jeans.  Hang the string by the loop, and measure a decent length to cut the string.](http://i.imgur.com/jVI9Jh.jpg)

3) [Determine where you want your tea bags to be, and tie them there](http://i.imgur.com/sJeRfh.jpg)

4) [Finished Product.  Repeat once more for other leg](http://i.imgur.com/Tserfh.jpg)

4) [Leave overnight, or whenever you're not wearing your jeans](http://i.imgur.com/GkZJ7h.jpg)

Depending on how many tea bags you use (the more the better), you should start to smell results overnight.

I hope this will be helpful to at least some people.

I'm a very skinny guy, and I normally wear jeans of the size _28/32_, though my natural ""true"" waist size is _32""_. My understanding is that most, if not all, raw denim brands size linearly, if that makes sense, with one waist size corresponding to one and only one length. This presents a problem for me, since my waist is as skinny as my legs are long, if that makes any sense.

Specifically, I'm looking at either [these APC jeans](http://uscheckout.apc.fr/browse.cfm/4,1675.html?nav=denim), or [these ""petite"" jeans](http://uscheckout.apc.fr/browse.cfm/4,1678.html?nav=denim). I understand one is supposed to size down when buying raw denim, due to the jeans stretching with wear.

I guess I have two questions, then:

1. My best fitting pair of jeans is a pair of Levi's 511 (skinny), which one of the two pairs I posted above would fit closest to that?
2. What size should I go for, keeping in mind I normally buy size 28/32 jeans?
