**Preface**

The MFA basic wardrobe is very general to fit a vast majority of people. This guide is much more specific to ages up to 18 as beyond that, MFA is a better option. I’ve included all the basics and fundamentals that are useful and necessary, along with some extras. I’ve tried to keep prices quite low, as I know most teenagers don’t have a lot of money (or jobs to earn it). Just remember that, most of the time, you get what you pay for.

Remember, **Fit is the most important thing for all clothes**: nothing can make cheap clothes look better like a good fit, and conversely, nothing can make expensive clothes look cheap like a bad fit. OTR (off the rack) clothing sizes have a huge variation depending on the manufacturer—the small shirt that may fit you perfectly in one brand could be like a compression shirt in another.  

Check out the guide, ['How Clothes Should Fit'](http://redd.it/ehrtv), in /r/malefashionadvice for more info.
*****

**Shirts** – The basic design of suits, shirts, and the like are to complement and draw attention to your face. For this reason I prefer V-necks over crew necks. Graphic t-shirts can be questionable: I think a nice graphic t is perfect for a teenager’s wardrobe and unique or one-of-a-kind designs can look great, but stay away from brand names, band tees, and “vintage graphic tees”.

* [**Mossimo V-Necks** - $10](http://bit.ly/Tcfwsz) – Multiple colors, I recommend gray, navy, black, and white for starters – you can find these at target, they’re slim fitting and v-necked. Similar:  [**Gap Crew**](http://gap.us/10AsGBN) and [**Gap V**](http://gap.us/Wnoy2H) These are my favorite. Really comfortable, last forever, and if you get them in store, they’re always super cheap (especially if your mom frequently gets discounts).

* [**Mossimo Polo** - $15](http://bit.ly/XSgo3m) – Multiple colors, another basic; don’t think because it has a collar that you have to only wear it for a “special” occasion/reason. Similar: [**Gap Polos** - $30](http://gap.us/XSh9cJ) but high price for what you get. **My preference**: **Rugby “Small Skull” Polos** ~$30 if you use a student discount and wait for 2-for sales (for some reason they aren’t showing up in the online store right now; will add link later)

* **Henleys** [**Uniqlo Long Sleeve** - $13](http://bit.ly/10Foa5c) and [**American Eagle Short Sleeve** - $15](http://on.ae.com/SxLEFA) – Good alternative to t shirts and look good layered under casual button-downs. **Side note**: I wouldn’t normally suggest AE as a good brand, however this is a cheap short sleeve henley that will last a while and actually doesn’t have a fat ugly logo.

**Button-Downs** – This is a place to remember how important fit is: OTR button down shirts may (and a lot of the time *will*) need tailoring. As a *guideline*, thicker and heavier weaves (such as oxford and twill) are more casual the shirt and lighter weaves (poplin and broadcloth) are more formal. **Do not let your undershirt show or don’t wear one at all!** (I’ve listed these from casual to formal)

* [**Uniqlo Casual Shirts** - $10-30](http://bit.ly/RRM2Kx) – Great shirts, slim fitting and at a very good price point.

* [**Mossimo Flannels** - ~$23](http://bit.ly/TdFnQV) – Few options online, likely more in store. Similar: [**CCS Flannels** - $20-40](http://bit.ly/141nuWy) – Great on sale, thick and last forever. 

* [**Lands End Canvas (LEC) Twill Workshirt** – $30](http://bit.ly/Su1VeK)

* **H&amp;M** - $10-30 – H&amp;M has an awful online store but generally has a large range in store. Fit is pretty slim but construction is on the poor end.

* [**LEC Oxford Cloth Button-Down (OCBD)** - $30-40](http://bit.ly/Klm9Ou) – Have sales very often. White/blue are the typical basic colors to get.

* [**Alfani Red “Dress” and “Sport” Shirts** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/VWGtj7) – Sales often. Good slim shirts, dress shirts are usually pretty long and need to be tucked.

* [**J Crew Factory Sport and Dress Shirts** - $20-40](http://bit.ly/XT6nmg) – Sales are frequent and so are email promo codes. Fits quite well, can be pretty long and need to be tucked or hemmed.

* [**Uniqlo Dress Shirts** - $10-30](http://bit.ly/TZnK16) – Same as above qlo description.

*****

**Pants**

**Jeans** – Most likely will be your most used item and a staple for your wardrobe. Stick to dark indigo and slim fitting.

* [**Uniqlo Jeans** - $50-90](http://bit.ly/Xxd6zG) – Good quality, especially the ""Made in Japan"" line, which does have some selvedge and raw jeans.

* [**Levi’s 511** - ~$40](http://amzn.to/VOfnKe) – Slim fit tapered leg. Clean Dark and Rigid Dragon are safe.

* [**Levi’s 508** - ~$40](http://amzn.to/141s0V4) – Less slim fit but more thigh room. Go with the Rigid Envy.

* My recommendation: [**Unbranded Selvedge** - $78](http://urbout.co/WcmAnF) – Hop on the raw denim hype you’ve heard all about. Probably the best cheap option out there and well worth it

**Cords** – A good F/W option. Earthy tones work well here as does navy. Make sure the wale (cord width) is thin.

**Chinos** – Known as khakis (khaki is the popular color and chino is the material).

* [**Uniqlo Chinos** - $40](http://bit.ly/11QkPjZ) – Quite slim fitting, but good quality.

* [**Dockers Alpha Khaki** - $45](http://amzn.to/10lsx0d) – Slim fitting (close to Levi’s 511). Navy and earth tones are good color options.

* [**Dockers D1** - $37-45](http://amzn.to/WSsiaM) – Slim straight cut (no taper past the knee).

**Shorts** – Slim, flat-front shorts are the best option. At or slightly above the knee is going to look the best (can be “embarrassing” in high school, if so, just keep them from being man-pris and you’ll be ok). RL Rugby has good options, as does LEC and J Crew.

*****

**Layering** – Good casual options are hoodies, crew neck sweaters, and thick knit sweaters/cardigans, and more smart-casual are cardigans and v-necks.

* [**Gap Crew Neck Sweater** – $40](http://gap.us/10lwQZm) – Versatile: can be worn layering, or as a top piece.

* **Hoodies** H&amp;M has good cheap (in store) hoodies. Light gray and navy are good colors, skip the black on this one. Online options are easy to find, just look for solid colors and no branding.

* [**Qlo Thick Knit Cardigan** – $20](http://bit.ly/VmfATC) – Warm layering piece. Good for “easing” your way into wearing cardigans.

* **Qlo Cardigans** [**Merino Wool** - $20](http://bit.ly/VWKIeK) and [**Lambswool** - $20](http://bit.ly/UOgqIW)

* **Gap V-Neck Sweaters** [**Merino Wool** - Currently on sale $34](http://gap.us/YjY6vG) – Quality is so-so, thin and back will pill. Still a good option, especially on sale. [**Cotton** - $40](http://gap.us/10BX2nF)

*****

**Shoes**

**Sneakers/Casual Shoes** – Going to be the biggest option here as sneakers are going to be the most useful for teens.

* **Canvas** – [**Vans Authentic** - $40](http://amzn.to/XwdaQh) Vans stores also always have authentics if you can’t get your size online. True-White is the best color here. Other options are [**Converse Chuck Taylors** - $50](http://amzn.to/WeVD2J) – go for the Optical White and [**Jack Purcells** - $60](http://amzn.to/Ws680F) – White/White colorway.

* **Skate shoes** – Tread very carefully here (pun *completely* intended), the thinner the better, stay the hell away from thick bulky skate shoes. Some examples: [**Nike SB Janoski** - $70-110](http://bit.ly/Xwddvl) – great option, also check out the customizable ones if you’re ok paying a little more [**Adidas Campus Vulc** - $50-75](http://bit.ly/Wjvo89) and [**Campus 2** - $50-75](http://amzn.to/10C0yhO)

* [**Espadrilles** - $28-45](http://bit.ly/K0b7NZ) – Good summer casual footwear.

* [**Vans C&amp;L 59**](http://bit.ly/102s03i) – Good casual shoe with a small addition of leather.

**Leather shoes**

* [**Sperry A/O** - $80](http://bit.ly/VWMbkZ) – best colors are Sahara, Classic Brown, and Navy. Better to wear with shorts as a whole. Stay away from boat shoe/sneaker hybrids.

* [**CDBs** - $80](http://amzn.to/UgJzNO) – You better know them. I refuse to say ~~anything~~ much about them because I see them so often I’ve grown quite a distaste for them. They are still a great option and very versatile.

* **Bucks** [**Bass Buckingham** - $80](http://bit.ly/1072BtT) – Awesome shoes. Best colors are going to be taupe suede (referred to as “dirty bucks”) or white. Make sure to let them get dirty from wear and they’ll look even better.

* **Dress Shoes** – Check MFA’s [Shoe Guide](http://redd.it/p7usf) for a much more thorough guide. I would stick to a black cap-toe, a brown brogue or wingtip, and maybe loafers; remember, chances are you won’t need them often and you will have plenty of time for formalwear the rest of your life.

*****

**Accessories**

* **Watch** – [**Timex Weekender** - $25-30](http://amzn.to/tAicM4) or [**Timex Easy Reader** - $25-30](http://amzn.to/Yk16bD) – Self explanatory

* **Belt** – Buy one, no buy two: one in black and one in brown (leather of course, full grain if you can). Hell, [make your own](http://redd.it/k6uro).

* **Hats** – As teenagers, it’s much easier to get away with hats, just stick with caps. I’d go with fitted or snapbacks for sports teams (preferably baseball, as it’s a baseball cap), or the official [MFA x Ebbets custom cap](http://redd.it/16r48w).

*****

**To Wrap it Up**

Try to build your wardrobe **slowly**. Don’t rush it, or as you learn more, you will end up with a lot of pieces that you realize were bad purchases and are 1) ugly, 2) don’t fit, or 3) aren’t versatile at all. You should also take it slow so you don’t blow the sparse amount of money you likely have.

**Good big brand stores**

* [**Uniqlo**](http://www.uniqlo.com) – Online store recently added. MFA’s lovechild for cheap, pretty well-made, well-fitting clothing.

* [**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com) – Better in store options than online. Very cheap, not well made, and probably won’t last too long.

* [**Target**](http://www.target.com) – Has good options on a budget. Check out what [Primer](http://bit.ly/qcXaUl) has to say on Target.

* [**Gap**](http://www.gap.com) – Decent quality and frequent sales. Gap has been stepping up their game recently and has been offering better clothes.

* [**Old Navy**](http://www.oldnavy.com) – Similar to Gap, but generally not as good. Quality is slightly below that of Gap’s.

***

As this subreddit is made for teenagers, I think we should talk about how to dress appropriately for school and everyday life. Whether or not a teen is dressed appropriately seems to be a major point of contention around both MFA and here so I think this guide could help with that. There are a lot of variables to appropriate dress in high school - the region of the school, the social position of the student, age, occasion, the season, and even the type of school are the most important factors to consider.

**Factors**

***

*Region* - Different regions typically have different styles. What's standard in the south could be ridiculous in the north, what's standard on the east coast may be ridiculous on the west coast, etc.
 
*Social position* - Let's be honest. People who are more popular can generally get away with more than the average person. Of course, there is still a line, but it's certainly further away from the line for the average person. In MFA, it's constantly noted that famous people can pull off things that normal people could almost never pull off by virtue of their fame. This factor in appropriate dress is essentially the high school version of that. This is also likely one of the most abstract factors but when in doubt, keep it safe.

*Age* - TeenMFA caters to a wide audience. 13 year olds to 19 year olds all fit the teen description, despite 13 year olds having barely hit puberty and 18 and 19 year olds legally being adults. As such, your age will have a huge factor in what's appropriate for you to wear. For example, an 18 year old wearing a button down tucked into chinos with wingtips? *May* not raise eyebrows (again, the other factors come into play here). Might even be pulled off with aplomb. A 13 year old wearing the same? Almost certainly will be a strange sight, and more importantly, almost certainly will be ridiculed. Please don't put yourself through that.

*Occasion* - Obviously, the occasion at hand is a huge factor in whether or not your dress is appropriate. Consider a simple navy blazer - wearing one to school one day for no reason wouldn't be the best idea. Wearing one to a school banquet? Absolutely. Say you have a dinner date - feel free to dress up to an extent. Actually, that would even be encouraged. A full suit would be ridiculous of course, but a button down and chinos? Absolutely appropriate for the occasion. Or say you're getting ready for a pickup game of basketball with some friends - what's more appropriate, your jeans, or some athletic shorts? In short, the occasion at hand is a very important factor in the appropriateness of your dress.

*Season* - Seasonal clothing is fairly straightforward and a lot of this is basically common sense. Still, it’s worth noting here as it is certainly an important factor in dressing appropriately. The seasons as far as fashion is concerned are Spring/Summer and Fall (Autumn)/Winter. What’s appropriate in Spring/Summer very well may not be appropriate in Fall/Winter. Boat shoes are a fine example of this. During the Spring/Summer season, they’re a staple in the wardrobes of many men. However, they’re not seasonally appropriate in Fall/Winter, especially as time goes on. Other examples like this would be seersucker clothing, linen clothing, and usually shorts (in certain more temperate regions they may be fine). Likewise, things like thick knit sweaters, wool coats like peacoats or duffle coats, and flannel clothing are commonplace during the Fall/Winter season but are quite inappropriate during the Spring/Summer (unless the environment calls for it of course).

*Type of school* - this is probably the most obvious. The common types of schooling are private school, public school, and home school. Public school students - well, this guide will cater most to you. Private school students - uniforms are fairly common at private schools, and as such, chinos, polos, button downs, and perhaps even blazers may be not only standard, but mandatory. As such, this is likely the most important factor for you. Not every private school is like this of course, and if there is no mandatory uniform or specific dress code, then you're basically like public school in that regard. Either way, the other factors certainly apply outside of school. Home schooled students - obviously this won't apply while in school since you can basically wear whatever you feel like. As with private schools, the other factors will still be relevant outside of school though.

***

Now, with all that said, I should note – however casual the standard dress is in your situation, there is a certain bottom line. Sweatpants, gym shorts, [slides]( http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;amp;amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;amp;amp;tid=12914512), running shoes, and the like (athletic apparel basically) should all be kept to the home, the gym, or wherever else you’re doing something athletic. Team jerseys are debatable – if your style is more streetwear focused, they can be fine, but otherwise, they should be lumped into the above group. Likewise, flip flops are an oft-contested choice of footwear – they're fairly okay in places like California or Florida and are often even considered staples during the summer months, but in most places, they should be reserved for the pool/beach/gym showers and not for standard wear. Basically, use discretion when deciding whether or not to wear them. Likewise, there’s a certain upper line, but it’s less of a clear one. Blazer/chinos pairings or suits would most likely be this upper line but of course, there are exceptions to this - namely occasions that call for them such as dances or ceremonies. Still, without a specific reason to wear them (and no - “Formal Friday” among your friends doesn’t count), it’s almost guaranteed that you will *not* be dressed appropriately, so tread carefully.

***
**T-shirts**

* [Crew neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/mddmW.jpg) are the simplest of all casual shirts. Anyone can pull them off and they are a lot of people’s go-to shirt when it comes to casual wear. Compared to scoop necks and v-necks, crew necks are more conservative as they fit snugger around your neck.

* [V-neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TfC63.jpg) are less restrictive around your neck compared to crew necks and are slowly gaining popularity among the masses of men's clothing. Unless you go to a really rural school you should see lots of guys wearing these.

* [Scoop neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/ByVNW.jpg) are the least conservative and least popular of the three many types of t-shirts. I do not recommend wearing these until you are confident in your sense of style as they can look extremely feminine when done wrong.

* [Henleys](http://i.imgur.com/suvoLh.jpg) can look great in place of a crew or v-neck if you have a muscular build. I recommend getting a long sleeve one like TheNicolai because really, who doesn’t want to look a little more like him? Though seriously, they look really cool when you push the sleeves up. Also, it's worth noting that unless you're extremely fit, the short sleeve versions will look bad.

**[Polo shirts](http://i.imgur.com/QA0MI.jpg)** are a great step between casual t-shirts and button ups. Polos are common around high schools and can look great when worn with a pair of [jeans and some nice leather shoes](http://i.imgur.com/jotx9.jpg). Boat shoes also look great with polos, as I consider them to be on the same level of formality as polos. When picking up polos, you can never go wrong with solid colors. They will look better than striped ones 90% of the time. One last thing to remember about polos is to avoid the long sleeve versions as they will almost always look terrible.

**Button up shirts** are whole new territory and are probably the hardest to pull off when it comes to everyday high school life. Even though it can be a challenge, they can look awesome when done well. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/FhaMZ.jpg) [are](http://i.imgur.com/2Kf8W.jpg) [a](http://i.imgur.com/B6UL8h.jpg) [few](http://i.imgur.com/Qao6H.jpg) [examples](http://i.imgur.com/lIxYO.jpg) of how button ups can be pulled off in a casual setting. If you are going to wear a button up to school I recommend getting a shirt with [button down collars](http://etiquette-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/button-down-collar-shirt.jpg) as they are much more casual than a [button up dress shirt](http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image//expressfashion/20_030_6564_947_14?wid=300). When deciding when to tuck or untuck your button up, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, if your shirt is rather long, keep it tucked in as it will appear to fit you better. Second, keep in mind the [appropriateness of the occasion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/wlj36/the_teenmfa_guide_to_dressing_appropriately/) as it will make or break your outfit. Two other things to remember when wearing a button up is that [rolling up your sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/7IYyr.jpg) will instantly make a button up more age appropraite, the second thing to remember is that unless you are extremely fit and secure in your sense of style, short sleeve button ups should be avoided as they can appear to be extremely childish or dad-like if you're not. When picking out button up shirts for school, a few recommended patterns are [gingham](http://cluemagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ginghamshirt.jpg), [windowpane](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq8mjgjMuc1qa5p47o1_500.jpg), [madras](http://i.imgur.com/cBn9Lh.jpg), and [candy stripe](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2b87qT5uNF4/SJzdSUQrtjI/AAAAAAAAEgw/ihp1WtYNKLw/s400/PICT1099.jpg).

As always no matter what you wear, whether or not you are dressed well will come down to how the clothes fit, your confidence in them, and the situation you are in, so make sure that you are not overdressing or not confident in taking the next steps in your wardrobe, because not only make the clothes look bad but you may look worse than before you started dressing nicely to begin with.

Like all the other guides this is a work in progress and if you feel that something should be added, let me know and I would be happy to edit it in, if it fits well with the guide. Lastly I would like to throw out some love to /u/Telekineticism for doing a fantasitc job on that last guide and for helping edit this one

A good-looking haircut is extremely important too.

• But what's more important in high school is having *your own style*. A style that describes **you**. It's what sets you apart, and ultimately lets you be more confident in yourself. 

• Some 'fashion rules' apply only to adults in the *fucking adult world*, so before you start wearing your ties and sleek chinos to sophomore english, think for a second about what clothes make you most confident. If you can pull off dressing like a homeless man, and make it look good-- fucking do it. 

• Don't be afraid to wear shirts with different-designed pockets, because they just might look dope as fuck on you. If you're on this subreddit to create a more mature wardrobe and get advice while you try, then you're in the right place. But just remember, high school and college are the times to dress *however the fuck you want, and actually be able to get away with it.* 

Having said all that, I'll be going into college with a fresh wardrobe of clothes that fit, a fair knowledge of matching, but especially clothes that are a little more crazy than the average kid trying to act twice his age. Clothes that are 'out-there' describe me a little better.

**TL;DR** Your style should match your personality; your style should match how you feel about yourself.

1329270820.0,47,self.TeenMFA,pq1m2,Spring/Summer Guide for Teens,60,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/pq1m2/springsummer_guide_for_teens/,"Well it's just around the corner though it may not seem like it for some of you with snow still on the ground but I felt this subreddit needs to have it's own guides mainly because things in the MFA guides do not apply or are missing things that matter to teens so this will be built around there guides but changed to things that are more appropriate for are age.
  
**Shirts/Tops -** Fit is very important during the summer because you cannot layer with jackets and such to hide something that does not fit as well. I feel the main shirt for summer for teens should be one color or striped (if you have a fit/athletic build) tees/V-Neck tees, get them in neutral and bright colors and make sure they work with the outfit. It is also good to have a few short sleeved polos to switch them out with so your not always wearing the same thing. Also some light or dark (make sure they are not to dark or at least suit the weather as something light is usually more summery) button downs are good to and make sure to roll up the sleeves. Tanks are also still an option if you are a teenager with an athletic upper body for tanks you should buy bright colors and patterns in my opinion and make sure they are not logo tanks. Neutral colors with bright stripes look good for tanks. 
  
**Bottoms -** Shorts are what you are going to mainly be wearing. You don`t need to wear shorts as short as the guys in MFA, I feel as a Teen go for somewhere between top 3/4 of the knee cap to 1 1/2"" inches. You can go more but you really need to make sure you're wearing the right shirt for it. I suggest you should buy a pair of khaki shorts and then a pair of colored shorts and maybe a pair with a pattern. I suggest not wearing pants during the summer but if you do try picking up a pair of khaki chinos or another color.  
  
**Shoes -** My favorite part of summer is wearing shoes sock-less which is what I recommend you do in conjunction with a pair of insoles made for being worn with bare feet. But if you're not into that buy some socks that don't show wearing socks above your shoes with shorts does not look good. Try and limit your flip flop wearing to be only on the beach but if you live somewhere where people wear them generally then it is ok. Avoid wearing high top shoes and mid top shoes with shorts you want something that is light weight and low cut. You can't go wrong with a pair of boat shoes during the summer. Wear lightweight canvas sneakers and shoes as they look best with shorts. Some good options are, a pair of brown penny loafers, oatmeal boat shoes, or brown chukkas will do also note then tennis shoes should not be worn unless going to the gym or participating in a sport if you did not know that.

**Hats -** As you're a teenager you can still make flat brim caps look good, try not to leave the brim perfectly flat though add a little bend. Try and buy a hat with a color that will be able to go with most of you're outfits but if you're only going to buy one hat don't make it a black hat. Short brimmed snapbacks also look good when going to the beach just see what you like. But remember don't wear the same hat everyday therefor if you only have one try wearing it once or twice a week at most, even if you have more make sure you're not wearing one everyday try to not wear one more often then you do. Also snapbacks are a really good choice if they fit you properly as they are coming back into style. 
  
**Sunglasses -** Unless you plan to take care of them don't buy any thing expensive. My advice is see what people where you live are wearing and get something that reflects that style. If you do want to buy a good pair make sure they fit your face properly and are exactly what you want.  
  
**Jackets -** All you will need if anything is something lightweight and waterproof for rainy days. I suggest looking at street wear brands for a rain jacket as they usually have a lot of good choices.  
   
**Sweaters -** Exactly the same as in the MFA guide. (link below)  
  
Use this in conjunction with [The MFA Summer Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqc1c/springsummer_guide_v20/) to pick out a great summer wardrobe please comment and tell me what you think as this is my first guide.

[Edit]: Changed info in hats regarding comment on snapbacks. Added input from CrunchyWalrus Thanks.

At least 4 Shirts

Right now you may still be growing at a rapid pace, so it's best to not go and shell out a lot for shirts like MFA would normally suggest. I recommend sticking  with lower cost brands like Old Navy and H&amp;M, then tailoring yourself using the [Pinch and Pin method](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf3OxmanTig). That doesn't mean don't look at higher quality brands, but I would only buy from them if you really like something or if you think that you are slowing down your growth rate. 

At least 7 T-shirts

For T-Shirts in high school it's okay to wear graphic tees. People at MFA don't like them because they make you look like a teenager. Well, you are. Embrace it for the time you have left as one. Just avoid any with branding, writing, or douchey patterns. Find t-shirts that are utilized as a canvas instead of a billboard. You can find t-shirts like these at http://www.threadless.com/ or http://www.designbyhumans.com/ . But there are some shirts here that still violate these rules. 

Even if you do choose to get graphic tees, you still should have a good supply of various well fitting solid colored crew and v-neck tees. American Apparel generally has the best fit, but Target is a good resource too.

**Pants**

At least 3 Pairs

For jeans, get a pair or two of Levi 501s, 514, or 511s, depending on how you like the fit. I personally go with 514s. Like shirts, if you feel like you are more or less done growing if you can shell out for some of the more expensive stuff. I plan on picking up a pair of Naked and Famous raw dark indigo slim guy jeans for $140. I'll let you guys know how that goes.

Chinos may look a little too preppy depending on where you go to school, but don't be afraid to go outside the norm. Get a few flat fronted pair in various colors.

**Shoes**

At least 2 Pairs

I recommend getting a pair of casual shoes  and a pair of athletic shoes only for sports and working out. For the majority of you, plimsolls (Chuck Taylor, Jack Purcell, etc) are your best bet. Skate shoes are okay since we are teenagers if you get them in simple patterns [such as](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/l3a.html?categoryId=10105#variation-3) if you actually skate. For those of you in your later teens feel free to be adventurous and to try some of the stuff MFA would suggest for casual occasions (lol Desert Boots). 

**Bags**

Unless you have a laptop, avoid messenger bags and get a regular backpack. Not many beat the durability, minimalism, and cost effectiveness of a solid colored Jansport.

**Outerwear**

[Only get solid colored hoodies.](http://www.americanapparel.com/f497.html?cid=210). For warmer weather get a few cardigans in  colors that work with what you normally wear.

I'm from San Diego so I'll need some help with winter coat advice.

**Accessories and Various**
A watch can really pull together an outfit. I'll just give the cliche MFA citation Timex Easy Reader or Seiko 5 with assorted NATO Straps.

Get your socks and underwear at Costco or  at a store like Ross or TJ Maxx. Get your underwear however but white socks are only for athletics. For normal wear, get black and a bunch of other colors you see and you feel like getting.

A lot of places clothing stores tend to sell headphones devices with fashion being their primary function. As what most people would call an ""audiophile"", when I see people wearing Skullcandy, Bose, or Beats headphones I wish I can go back in time to the person's infancy so I can push their soft spot in. Seriously, don't buy [overpriced shit sounding cheesy looking headphones](http://files.headphoneconert-rigi.webnode.com/200000002-02cdb03c82/Skullcandy_Give-away.JPG). Stick with quality brands that actually make stuff for the pro audio market like [Sennheiser](http://cdn.cbsi.com.au/story_media/339298598/sennheiser_hd_448_1.jpg), [Shure](http://www.gearculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shure-professional-headphones.jpg), [Audio-Technica](http://gadgets.softpedia.com/images/gadgets/gallery/large/The-Audio-Technica-ATH-AD700-Headphones-1.png), or [Grado](http://gearcrave.frsucrave.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/gradosr80.jpg). A pair of these will last you years and you will never want to listen to music anyway else after using a good pair of headphones.

This guide is pretty simple. It has a few prefaces so you can get some quick facts about shoes in general, but it quickly goes into a lengthy look into different types of shoes fit for a teen to wear, and then it mentions a few footnotes about shoes. **The most important parts are the beginning (everything before plimsolls) and the end (everything in the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/1769ji/comprehensive_shoe_guide/c82lt3q))**. It is also important for you to know that I have linked the shoes to, as often as I could, the original manufacturer. Typically, manufacturers are far more expensive to buy from than zappos or amazon or ebay. More on where to buy shoes later.

When it comes to shoes, you want to start out with several versatile pieces. They are more expensive than most articles of clothing, so you will have fewer shoes than pants/shirts. Once you get the essentials down, you can experiment with more interesting shoes. The biggest thing you want to avoid is trainers/running shoes in place of actual casual shoes.


**Regarding the shape of shoes**

Right now, fashion is all about slim silhouettes and tailored looks. Because of this, you're going to want round toed shoes, as they are more natural looking than square toed or pointed shoes.


**On Leather Shoes**

Just because a shoe is leather *does not* mean that it is formal. All the shoes listed here are casual, and can be worn with a tee and jeans or shorts.

**Plimsolls**

Plimsoll canvas sneakers are great, and I'd say they're an essential to a highschooler's wardrobe. As far as color goes, gray is going to be your most versatile, basic color. If you're feeling lost and overwhelmed when it comes to shoes, just buy a gray pair of vans and it'll work with damn near everything. White is another great color, but you either need to get them really dirty for a rugged feel or keep them clean for a crisp look. Black is over rated if you ask me, as it doesn't look very good with blue(an integral color of a wardrobe). Bright colors work great in the summer, and sneakers with patterns are also a nice way to spice up a simple outfit. If you want a color that's versatile but off the beaten track, try maroon or olive.

* [vans authentics](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/41$.html) vans authentics are the simplest and arguably the most versatile canvas sneaker there is. They go great with shorts or jeans, try them with no socks or no show socks for best results. [keds](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/category;jsessionid=2AF44029F41717A1160C6625278A214B.src-app-03-p-app1?catId=cat610201&amp;&amp;subCatTabId=cat2600419) are essentially the same as vans, and of equal quality.

* [Converse Jack Purcells](http://www.converse.com/#/products/collections/JackPurcell) These are nice, simple shoes. Get lo-tops and wear them just like you would vans or keds. All of their more complex designs on the converse website are honestly pretty ugly, so just grab a simple color.

* [converse Chuck Taylors](http://www.converse.com/#/products/collections/ChuckTaylor) Chuck Taylors are much more iconic than the other choices. They have more branding and because of it give a more punk feel than the others, but the lo-tops can easily work in most outfits. Chuck Taylors are also the best hi-top canvas sneaker. More on hi-tops later.

* [Vans C&amp;L Era 59](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/exdcal.html?vcategoryId=COREMETRICS_IO&amp;cm_vc=marketing&amp;cm_mmc=vans.com-_-marketing-_-Recommendations-_-C%26L+Era+59|EXDCAL) This is a more interesting line of canvas sneaker. They have leather accents that give it a different feel than the vans authentics, but because of this they are also less versatile. They're great with shorts and a tee to subtly add something to a simple outfit.

If you look around on the vans or converse websites for a little bit, you'll probably find quite a few with decent patterns. These are great too, but remember that they aren't as versatile and can definitely be overwhelming. Try to go for a more subtle pattern that *looks good* I know it's hard to understand what I mean, but just look at it. Too often people buy shoes because they look *cool* and not aesthetically pleasing.

Also, check out this [sneaker guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/m7fuw/mfa_we_dont_have_a_sneaker_guide_so_i_present_to/) from MFA.

**Boat Shoes**

Shopping for a boat shoe is very simple. Get a pair in basic leather colors, a tan or a brown. Personally, I like tan boat shoes. Boat shoes will not/should not have any sort of pattern to them. You can find canvas boat shoes(most often from vans), but I really don't think those look as good. You should wear boat shoes without socks(or with no-show socks; check the socks section), unless you really know what you're doing. Boat shoes are best with shorts, but passable with chinos.

* [Sperry Top-Sider](http://www.sperrytopsider.com/store/SiteController/sperry/productdetails?catId=cat90046DM&amp;subCatId=cat100064DM&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;stockNumber=0532002&amp;skuId=***7********0532002*M130&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;&amp;subCatId=cat100064DM&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;stockNumber=0532002&amp;subCatTabId=&amp;catId=cat90046DM&amp;productdisplayName=Men's+Authentic+Original+Boat+Shoe&amp;subcatdisplayName=Authentic+Originals&amp;skuId=***7********0532002*M130&amp;pageIdentifier=productdetail&amp;catdisplayName=Men&amp;showDefaultOption=true) These are by far the most common boat shoes, and for good reason. They're affordable and durable. Get these in tan, oatmeal, classic brown, or amaretto.

**Boots**
Ahh, boots. Boots should only be worn with long pants, and generally in the winter or fall. Only get quality leather or suede boots, otherwise they'll just fall apart. All the boots recommended on MFA are great, but as you're a teen and (probably) poor, you won't want to spend too much money on boots. Because of this, I will not cover boots here. If you're interested, check out [MFA's boot guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z2quy/mfa_boot_guide_20122013/). It has everything you need to know about boots, as well as many great recommendations.

**Desert Boots**

Desert boots are categorized by their short height(for a boot) and few eyelets. Chukka boots are essentially the same thing, although chukka can refer to non-boots, and vans now has a few [chukkas](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/category/chukkas.html) as well. Desert Boots are appropriate all year round, but aren't a good choice in wet weather. They go great with jeans or chinos, but do *not* wear them with shorts. You will look ridiculous.

* [Clark's Desert Boots](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Boot/dp/B0007MCUTK) These are the circlejerk shoe of /r/mfa, but for a good reason. They are good looking, high quality shoes for a cheap price. The classic color is beeswax, but it looks good in all kinds of colors: Gray, Neutral Suedes, and even navy. That said, the most versatile colors will be beeswax, tan suede, and gray. Personally, I favor the beeswax. Be careful to not wear these shoes in the rain, as they have next to no traction. [Clark's Bushacres](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Bushacre-Lace-Up-Boot/dp/B00B1I5KFU) are essentially the same shoe, just with a lower quality upper and a nicer sole.

**Penny Loafers**
I love penny loafers. They are great with shorts, or cuffed pants. Don't wear socks with penny loafers, unless they're some dope ass wool socks and you're wearing long pants. They are a touch more versatile than boat shoes because they work better with jeans, but on the other hand they are also a little harder to pull off and even a hair more formal. For versatility's sake, grab brown penny loafers. Penny loafers were made popular long ago, and because of that there are plenty in thrift stores. There aren't any clearly superior penny loafer brands, so my advice is to just head to a thrift store and take a look at them.

Here are some pictures of Penny Loafers that look good: [1](http://theshoebuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Santoni-Percy-Penny-Loafer.jpg) [2]( http://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2012/04/18/crockett-jones-tan-apron-toe-penny-loafer-product-1-3304996-528720554_large_flex.jpeg) Note the minimal stitching and simple sole.

**Other Sneakers**

There are plenty of good looking sneakers that aren't plimsolls. What you're looking for is minimal branding, and versatile colors. As with plimsolls, gray is the most versatile color with white, burgundy, and blue coming in next. You can wear most sneakers with jeans, shorts, or even chinos.

* [Vans Chukkas](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/category/chukkas.html) Vans chukkas are great: No branding, simple designs, super versatile, and many colors. My favorites are the grays and tans. Avoid wearing shorts with these.

* [Adidas Campus](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-originals-campus-2-suede-shoes/07245) These are widely regarded as a good shoe, but I honestly am not a huge fan of them. Regardless, they're pretty versatile. They come in other colors as well. These are very similar to the adidas samba, but sambas are leather instead of suede.

* [New Balance 501](http://www.newbalance.com/New-Balance-501/ML501,default,pd.html?dwvar_ML501_color=Grey_with_Green&amp;start=3&amp;cgid=106000) and [New Balance 420](http://www.newbalance.com/New-Balance-420/U420,default,pd.html?dwvar_U420_color=Blue_with_White_and_Black&amp;start=19&amp;cgid=106000) New balances are in many people's opinions unattractive, but honestly they're pretty decent and few shoes have the same feel to them.

* [Nike Free Runs](http://www.footlocker.com/product/model:175362/sku:10642600/nike-free-run-+-3-mens/red/grey/?cm=TnDdMensRun) and [Nike Roshe Runs](http://dimeadozenclothing.com/staff/wp-content/uploads/Nike-Roshe-Run1.jpg) Nike Runs come in many different styles, but the simplest ones are the best. Don't get any with plastic 'shield' structure on them, it just doesn't look very good. Nike Runs come in mostly brighter colors, so if you're looking for something interesting these are a great choice. The Roshe Runs look awesome too, they're more simple than most of the Frees.

* [Nike Janoskis](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/stefan-janoski-premium-id-skateboarding-shoe/) These are great and commonly recommended too. The customization feature is a nice touch.

**Espadrilles**

Espadrilles are a moderately common style of shoe, popular mostly with teens and young people. They are pretty feminine, so watch out for that. Espadrilles are similar to a canvas sneaker, except because they have no laces they are almost sandal like. [Toms](http://images.toms.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/side/900x640/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/w/-/w-ash-canvas-classics-s-su12_1.jpg) are a great example of Espadrilles, however toms are overpriced. Because of their inexpensiveness, Espadrilles are great for more 'throwaway' looks: Interesting patterns, prints, and designs. Espadrilles are perfect for shorts. Neutral colors such as cream, white, and gray are great for espadrilles, but so are some bright colors(turquoise, red, etc.).

* [soludos](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men) These look pretty solid, and they're made for J. Crew so their quality has to be decent. They have a very beach look to them, and there are a few different patterns to choose from(although the patterned ones are a touch pricier).

* [Asos](http://us.asos.com/Men/Shoes-Boots-Trainers/Espadrilles/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=11246&amp;r=1&amp;mk=VOID) These are cheap as all fuck, and the striped one looks pretty nice.

* [Drilley's](http://drilleys.com/mens_espadrilles.aspx) A few of these have a grunge vibe that I'm not a fan of, but there's a few styles and colors that are unique here. They appear to be on sale right now(1/23/13), but they're ~40 bucks when not on sale, which is too expensive if you ask me.
**Hi-Tops**

Hi-Tops are a style of shoe that I don't have experience with. However, I do hear all the recommendations and can give some good guidelines for them. As with all shoes, they shouldn't be too crazy. White will probably be the most versatile color for hi-tops, and many are fond of getting white hi-tops and then beating the shit out of them so they have a worn out feel. Hi-Tops work best with jeans, and don't work well with shorts.

* [Nike Basketball Shoes](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,pwp,c-1+100701/f-10002+12001+4294967127+4294967145) Many of these are really loud, so try to pick out the more subdued ones(but don't be afraid of interesting colors, that's what makes some of these really work). [This Hyperfuse](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,pdp,ctr-inline/cid-100701/pid-670699/pgid-727750) is a great example of one that has some color going on, but isn't too noisy. That said, it's not a real versatile shoe because of the red and black color scheme.

* [Nike Air Jordans](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/air-jordan-2012-id-basketball-shoe/) Air Jordans are a classic basketball shoe. You can customize them on the Nike site(although they'll be cheaper found elsewhere; more on that later) and they're fairly simple. There are tons of models throughout the years, and many of them are good. Just remember, simpler is better.

* [Nike Dunks](http://www.nike.com/nikedunk/index.jhtml#l=chronicles&amp;co=US&amp;la=en) are another great hi-top.

* [Nike Blazers](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/blazer-mid-id-shoe/) These are my personal favorite out of the few I've mentioned. They're very simple, so it's easy to get a moderately versatile shoe. You can even get them without the 'swoosh', which would make them perfect in white and then beating them up for an edgy vibe.

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15mtml/top_5_jordans/) a great thread about air jordans on MFA.

**Bucks**
[Bucks](http://www.valetmag.com/gr/daily/style/profiles_features/outlook_spring10/art-week4_bucks8.jpg) are great casual, preppy shoes, perfect for spring time. They're similar to the oh so dressy oxford, except [bucks](http://www.valetmag.com/gr/daily/style/profiles_features/outlook_spring10/art-week4_bucks8.jpg) have a slightly different shape and are suede or nubuck instead of leather. Most brand name bucks are $100+, so you'll want to grab them at a thrift store, ebay, or amazon. Wear bucks with shorts(sockless) or longpants.

After 6 weeks in Europe this was my perception: people (teens) actually wear the bright colored shorts and rolled up pants and nice shoes that you see at H&amp;M, J Crew, GAP, etc. They don't get any crap for looking nice. No one gets called a faggot for dressing nice. People wear what they wanna wear.

Dressing like that here in the US is a whole other world. Being 17 and attending a pretty typical highschool campus, it's hard to ditch the vans, skater T, and hoodie. Wear something different like a striped v-neck, or shorts that are above the knee, or rolling up your pants, and there's a shitstorm of rude snarky comments about being a gay faggot.

So anyway I've kinda just been slowly changing my style so it's not crazy noticeable. But, I'm trying to wear stylish clothes. People have said I'm a ""hipster"" or whatever and that's fine, I just hate the look I get from people like ""oh that guy dresses really nice, he must be gay"".

After lurking here for a while I've noticed that the fashion opinions where I live are nothing like the opinions on this subreddit. On any given day, about 80% of the guys in my school will be wearing balketball or cargo shorts. For shirts they wear either nike/adidas logo tees or shirts for our school sports teams. For shoes they wear either running sneakers or sandals with black socks that go up to their calves. In the winter, it's loose fitting jeans and name-brand hoodies. Anyone who isn't dressed like this wears really tight skinny jeans and band shirts year round. From what I've read, this is almost exactly what MFA tells people not to wear.

Are you guys the odd one out at school when you dress the way MFA advises? Can anyone else from western New York tell me if their schools are like this too?

Without further ado, let's replace 'em !

**Low-end Backpacks**

* Herschel ( [Classic](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/classic-1811.html) 40 $ , [Heritage](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/heritage-2853.html) 55 $, [Pop Quiz](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/pop-quiz-1862.html) 70 $,
[Village](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/village.html) 90 $ ) - Pretty much everyone recommends these, be careful though - stiching tends to come apart and thanks to the pleather bottoms it rips holes easily.
* Everlane ( [Everlane Snap Backpack ](https://www.everlane.com/collections/mens-packs/products/snap-backpack-navy) 50 $, [Everlane Zip Backpack](https://www.everlane.com/collections/canvas-leather-packs/products/zipper-backpack-grey) 60 $, [Everlane Snap Backpack 2](https://www.everlane.com/collections/canvas-leather-packs/products/snap-pack-grey)  65 $  - They're great backpacks, the grey one is waterproof too and Everlane makes good stuff, although some people complain about dozens of loose threads and scratches on the leather.
* [Jansport Right Pack](http://www.jansport.com/js_product_detail.php?pid=TYP7) 55 $  - Better quality and more durable than Herschels plus life time guarantee, though they aren't as stylish as Herschels.
* [Stone Cloth](http://www.stonecloth.com) 74 $ - I can't speak for their quallity and there doesn't seem to be much shipping options to other states than the US but it sure has nice design.
* [Fjallraven Kånken Classic](http://www.fjallraven.us/p-55-knken-classic.aspx) 75 $ - I personally hate the desing of this bag, everyone has different taste and there are a lots of people who recommend it. Worth checking out !
* [Incase Terra Campus Pack](http://goincase.com/products/detail/terra-campus-pack-cl55382) 100 $ - I personally like this the most, nice pack but it's pretty expensive. Quality of this backpack is really great, I have it myself, it is bigger than it looks like, I might post pics if you were interested

**High-end backpacks**

* [Sportman's Rucksack](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/56724?feat=506221-GN2) 120 $

so recently it has struck me that this big playas are hitting the givenchy and RO like Chris brown hits his women, it's only a matter of time before the public catches on. Now is your chance to get ahead of the game and say 'yeah been there done that' before it becomes chiefwear. 

**TOPS**

**Neck lines** 

scoops give that drapey neck line, black white and shades of greys are all you need to start out with. [asos](http://www.asos.com/search/scoop?hrd=1&amp;q=scoop#state=Rf-700%3D1001%40Rf900%3D1600%40Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=Rf-400&amp;pge=0&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) does some cheap ones which fit the frame well. crews can also work well when it comes to sweaters as well. [raw edges](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-T-Shirt-With-Raw-Edge-Scoop-Neck/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2377727&amp;SearchQuery=raw%20edge&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;Rf900=1600&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Washedblue) can work really well when layered over longer bodied tops. 

**Body length**

now this is where you have to make a decision, after hours of searching for male long body tees i found nothing unless you want to drop [£70](http://www.thecorner.com/gb/men/short-sleeve-t-shirt_cod37409596ct.html) or so. but if you're looking for it as a layering piece you can try some [womens ones](http://www.gap.eu/browse/product.do?cid=78988&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=000674839003) just size up one or so to make sure it's not skin, skin tight and it's all gravy. 

**sleeves**

when it comes to sleeves, long sleeves and short sleeves are all good. just make sure the sleeve is longer and tighter than usual. again these are hard to find on a budget so you may want to stick to short sleeve tees; not look like a bellend who is wearing a tee to big so the arm is longer. if however you have a bit of money to throw around [silent](http://www.thecorner.com/gb/men/long-sleeve-t-shirt_cod37432404nu.html) does some p good ones.

**Jackets**

jackets play a key roll in making a sick silhouette, clean lines and shape are key. this is a point where it's good not to skimp out and get a nice one. [all saints](http://www.allsaints.com/men/coats/allsaints-bale-coat/?colour=5&amp;category=116) bale coat is redonkulas, along with the [cos](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Men/Coats_Jackets) selection which are a bit cheaper. 

**TROUSERS AND MAN SKIRTS**

**Jeans**

these are pretty easy really, and great if you just want to do some basic silhouettes. Any black or dark grey jeans will do, just make sure they're pretty tight and have a bit of stack at the bottom. asos are [pretty good for the price](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Skinny-Black-Jeans/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2341504&amp;SearchQuery=black%20skinny%20jeans&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Black) just size down as they stretch loads.

**Droppin' crotches**

drop crotches are cool and when done right can take you to that next level. it works especially well with sweats and jeans, just make sure the ankles taper so it doesn't look like you're wearing gym wear. [i love ugly does some dope ones](http://www.iloveugly.net/bottoms/zespy-pant.html)

**MAN SKIRTS**

[kanye](http://glamazonsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kanye-west-watch-the-throne-givenchy-skirt-kilt-glamazons-blog.jpg) pretty much wore one through the whole of the watch the throne tour and he looked like the bees knees. unless you're besties with a tailor or make your own clothes you're not getting a good looking one for cheap. if however you have a spare £250 DRKSHDW does a [redic one](http://www.thecorner.com/gb/men/casual-trouser_cod36368131iv.html)

**SHOES**

**Sneaks**

these are an important part of the aesthetic and it's worth dropping mad cash on them in the long run, CP, MMM, and RO all do sick ones if you have the money. but on the other hand what you're looking for is essentially an all white hi top shoe, best budget one I've found is the [Nike Dynasty](http://www.size.co.uk/product/nike-dynasty-hi-vintage---size--exclusive/50573/)

**Bootz**

boots can allow you to do a different type of silhouette compared to sneaks, and work really well with black jeans. key ones to look out for are chelseas, combat boots and side zips. if you're are buying boots again it's advised you spend a bit. [cos](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Men/Shoes/Leather_panel_boots/46917-2957613.1#c-4354831) does some cool ones as well as [bexley](http://www.bexley.com/Bexleyshoe-MMCVPRD-EN.htm?cdPrd=Enfield) but again if you have the money RO has some of the dopest ones. 

so there you go, you can now go and look like a discount kanye/ bieber and have people look at you weirdly in the chance it becomes a big look in 6-12 months.

* Fit means more than what you're wearing. As long as it's not something horrid. Use common sense on this one.

* Running shoes are for running and the gym and basketball shoes are for basketball also the same with most skate shoes so keep it that way.

* Cargo shorts are almost always a NO, look at the other posts with them if they look like those they're bad. Get flat fronts.

* If you're wearing baggy jeans they look bad. I'm sorry they do at least wear a straight cut. Tapered look best.

* You're not a walking billboard get rid of the brand names across your chest.

If seeking advice on an outfit, combination, or the fit of certain items:

* A picture is essential. Take a picture of you wearing your entire outfit (yes, that means shoes)

* Include your dimensions.

* List the items you are wearing. If the picture is low quality, list the colors.

* Explain your personal fit preferences (slim, skinny).

* Explain in which environment you may be wearing your outfit.

Also do not downvote post just because it is a bad outfit or something you don't like downvote posts because they aren't relevant to the conversation.

**Ivy League**

*Description:* The Ivy League look is something I sport fairly often because of how it walks that line between formal and informal. The Ivy League (also referred too as Ivy Style by some) look is very classy and simple. It originated in the '50s on college campuses across America. JFK was a total boss at Ivy League style back in his day. It compliments those with a average or athletic build but, remember, *fit is everything*!

*Examples of Ivy League looks:*

* [His sweater is bulgy in the back but this guy is doing it right.](http://www.ivy-style.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/68.jpg)

* [I don't like some of the outfits in this photo but classic Ivy examples.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AD942_ivyjum_DV_20110203232219.jpg)

*How to pull it off:* There's different ways to pull off a Ivy League look but I'll just cover my favorite. Let's face it, we're all just teens so buying expensive/high-quality products is hard for many of us.

This outfit consists of a white or [light-colored](http://www.express.com/1mx-extra-slim-fit-french-cuff-shirt-42466-800/control/page/3/show/3/index.pro) dress shirt (fitted preferably), a solid darker-colored sweater ([navy](http://www1.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/polo-ralph-lauren-crewneck-cotton-sweater?ID=560611&amp;CategoryID=5300#fn=spp%3D5%26ppp%3D96%26sp%3D1%26rid%3D19) is always a good choice), slim/straight [khakis](http://www.bonobos.com/po-8809-graham-slackers-slim-fit) (jeans can also fit this look so long as *they* [have the right fit](http://www.bonobos.com/dark-rinse-demin-slim-straight-fit)), and then a pair of brown [penny loafers](http://www.shoebuy.com/allen-edmonds-kenwood/438290/932500) or similar (I wear [these](http://www.dockersshoes.com/p/44982/c/22/BASTILLE-Red-Brown.aspx)) with a matching brown belt.

Keep in mind most persons sporting the Ivy League look have clean-cut hair and face.

**Street Style**

*Description:* Street Style is literally defined as any offbeat or avant-garde fashion inspired by contemporary culture of urban street people. Street Style is awesome because it can be *anything* and it's very flexible. It varies from city-to-city and can range from lots of bright colors to really dark, tight-fitting attire. Go for this look if you're looking for something that will make you stick out.

*Examples:* 

* [GQ has some great examples of street styles throughout America.](http://www.gq.com/style/street-style)

* [My favorite street-style outfits \(GQ slideshow\).](http://www.gq.com/style/street-style/201106/tommy-ton-polo-classic#slide=1)

*How to pull it off:* Street-style is what you make it. I don't often wear outfits referred too as street-style, but  [this](http://www.gq.com/images/style/2011/06/tommy-ton-polo-classic/tommy-ton-polo-classic05.jpg) is a pretty good starting point.

To pull of street-style, you have to be different. Not just like ""oh hey, he's wearing a funny colored tie with a plaid shirt"". When you walk into a room, people need to go ""that person is dressed so awesome that it actually makes me feel a bit awkward"". Here's what I do: I throw on a striped [dress shirt](http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10901&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=87663&amp;parentCategoryId=87658&amp;topCategoryId=12202&amp;productId=893365&amp;seq=03) with a [striped green tie](http://www.amazon.com/Woven-Clover-Green-Striped-Skinny/dp/B002VATKRG/ref=sr_1_40?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329536014&amp;sr=1-40), [slim khakis](http://us.dockers.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12637546&amp;cp=2271557.2271567.3015280&amp;parentPage=family), a [shawl-collared gray cardigan](http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theorion.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/9f/89f4af96-1a48-11e1-8d95-0019bb30f31a/4ed469695a45a.preview-300.jpg), brown shoes with a matching belt, and a pair of silver mirrored aviators. That's pretty fly in my neck of the woods and I'm like a gaze magnet with that on. Keep in mind that most people in street style look awkward.

**V-neck and Denim**

*Description:* Many people are against wearing v-neck tees because of that hipster aura that surrounds them. In reality though, they're pretty slick. As a word of caution - avoid v-neck tees with really, really deep cuts and, if you're a slim build, try the tee in-store before purchasing (but that goes for most clothing anyways). Wearing a v-neck tee and a pair of denim is a clean, date-night outfit for near any occasion.

*Examples:*

* [Red tee and dark denim](https://www.jackthreads.com/data/products/supersize_SamuraiVNeckTeeRedA.jpg)

* [Dark blue and dark denim](http://images.saksfifthavenue.com/images/products/04/264/2624/0426426246059/0426426246059R_300x400.jpg)

* [Athletic v-cut and denim](http://0.tqn.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/C/-/1/_5896425.jpg)

*How to pull it off:* This is a really easy one. All you need is a solid [v-neck tee](http://www.freshpair.com/Calvin-Klein-Micro-Modal-Short-Sleeve-V-Neck-T-Shirt-U5563.html) (use best judgement on deciding the color) and a pair of slim, nicely-fitting [jeans](http://www.501usa.com/levis-501-jeans.jpg) (recommended: Levi 501s or 511s). As far as shoes go, I'd recommend a black pair because your jeans should be a darker shade anyways.

**TOPS**

a staple in any wardrobe is t-shirts, v neck, crew or scoop whatever takes your fancy. the ones i think offer most bang for your buck are 

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=207191&amp;parent_categoryId=207169&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=20) coming in at 2 for £12, there are a load of style and colours so i suggest you pick up 4 of these in whatever you like. if you're just starting out I'd go heather grey, white, navy and a colour you like. [£24]

once you have t shirts you'll probably wan't a few button downs, they really come in handy now and then when you need to 'smarten up' a bit. were i'd probably go would be 

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Shirts/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=3602&amp;via=top) their own brand OCBD's roll in at around £22 a pop so are not too bad, I'd probably pick up 2. colours are up to you but i'd go white and another colour. [£44]

to keep you warm on top of all your new shirts you're going to need a hoody or sweater, one of each will do fine. for the hoody in my eyes there is only one

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=207226&amp;parent_categoryId=207169&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=200&amp;refinements=category~[207227|207226]&amp;noOfRefinements=1) there are a load of different colours, I've owned a few and for the price they can't be beaten. if you want something that matches most items I'd go navy as a solid choice. [£25]

for the sweater I'd probably go with a plain grey crew neck. 

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Bound-Crew-Neck-Jumper/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1884403&amp;cid=7617&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;Rf-200=16&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Greymarl) something like this would do just fine, but if you wanted to be on the edge this year go for some [cable.](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Cable-Knit-Jumper/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2312174&amp;cid=7617&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;Rf-200=16&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Grey) [£22-30]

now to keep you extra toasty on those cold winter nights you need a coat, my personal favourite at the moment is the

[UNIQLO](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/072931) mountain parker, it fits with the style of this wardrobe and has a great quality to price ratio. [£60]

**TROUSERS**

first off you're going to need a sick pair of jawnz, now over in the UK levis are £80 a pair which is a rip off. so for this we're going to be using

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Jeans/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=4208&amp;via=top#state=Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=Rf-400&amp;pge=0&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) own brand rolls in at around £25, i'm looking at the skinny or super skinny, but you take your pick. make sure you get a dark wash with no pre fades for maximum versatility. [£25]

then you're going to need some chinos, i recommend 2 pairs to mix it up now and then. for these we're going back to 

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Trousers-Chinos/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=4910&amp;via=top#state=Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=Rf-400&amp;pge=0&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) own brand again rolls in at £25. if you're getting 2 colours for autumn my be is on a khaki and an [olive](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Skinny-Chino/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2026669&amp;cid=4910&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Grey) pair, but again it's up to you. [£50]

**SHOES**

in this we're going to get 2 pairs, your casual everyday and something to step it up a gear. now trainers are personal preference but for this we're going with 

[nike blazers](http://www.endclothing.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=nike+blazers&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) i think they look cool as shit, but you may think otherwise. for maximum versatility go with grey and white, but if you already own a few pairs of shoes my bets on red or blue. [£66]

for something a little more 'classy'? we're going with desert boots, now in the UK desert boots are £80, the price is often seen not to be worth it and as we're on a pleb budget we'll be using

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;productId=5737490&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=&amp;searchTerm=desert%20boots&amp;pageSize=20) i saw them in store they look the same as CDB's, sure they may not last as long but i did say this is more of a 1-2 season guide. [£55]

so all in all it comes to £355 not including postage, you may want to pocket the savings or use them on CDB's it's up to you. but this was my guide for a full wardrobe criticize away.

See that sweet jacket but the price tag is too high? Fortunately, you can often avoid the disappointment by shopping online. 

**The good news:**
- You sit in your chair and shop. You don't even have to leave the house, so it's good if you live in areas that are a little isolated or just don't have enough time to go down to any shops.

- You want to shop at places that are out of your reach

- You want to shop styles and fashion that isn't normally stocked in your area/country

- There are almost ALWAYS sales that appear online. Each online store will have a ""SALE"" section, filled with discounts of up to 80% off. Take advantage of this.

- Delivered straight to your doorstep

**The bad:**
- Online stores are often based in different countries. An easy example is ASOS, which is based in England, and Urban Outfitters, which is based in the USA. 

- This means that shipping may sometimes be expensive, especially if you're online buying one thing at a time. However, many stores offer free shipping if your shopping cart will cost you a set amount ""x"", often $50.

- You can't try any of the clothes on and see how they fit, which is a hindrance, especially for pants and shoes.

- Delivery can take a while, especially for things from eBay, up to a month.

- It is definitely not the same as actually shopping for clothes, you can't feel the material and the quality, just what the website shows and says

- You need a debit/credit card to pay for your purchases, something that the younger members of this subreddit might not have.

**PAYMENT**

A number of different possibilities were outlined to me below:

- You can use a debit card. You can get one as young as 13 apparently, but may depend with your parents.

- You can buy a prepaid debit card from supermarkets (USA)

- You can ask older friends and relatives

- You will need a Paypal account often to make purchases.

**The websites:**
*[ASOS](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Shop-womens-fashion-mens-clothing-Free-Shipping-Returns/wtwin/?xr=1&amp;mk=na&amp;r=3):* ASOS is the stock standard in online shopping, offering up to 70% off their own branded clothing as well as popular name-brands such as Bellfield and Cheap Monday. Personally, I think the oxford shirts and shorts are of a good quality, and they offer sizes from XXS to XXL. Sales are on 24/7, with pop-up sales happening often. The site is based in England which offers very quick delivery if you live there, or quite efficient services if you live elsewhere.

Make use of their ""saved items"" feature to check if items go on sale or they get discounted even further. Stock does sometimes run out fairly quickly though, especially on sale stock, so get in quick.

*[Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp):* Urban Outfitters offers clothing that is a little bit more 'indie', as people might say here in Australia. The site is good in that it has a reviews system so that popular items are either praised or criticised, and that it also has sales on 24/7. Though not quite as cheap as ASOS, their clothing is still affordable and for Americans wanting to pick up a pair of Levi 511s and Dockers pants, it's a good place to shop. 

They have more name-brands than ASOS does, and from memory, shipping is fairly cheap. If you're American, go for it. Remember that non-sale stock gets replaced, whereas once sale stock is gone, it's gone for good. 

*[Plndr/Karmaloop](http://www.plndr.com/):* Plndr is the place to go if you're looking for streetwear, with brands like Crooks &amp; Castle and Obey. They do stock some very, very cheap clothing including button down shirts for less than $20, T-shirts galore and jackets for less than $30. There are also lots of name-brand shoes on sale, including Vans and Creative Recreation. 

When you're shopping online on Plndr, make sure that you buy when there is a 35% discount + free shipping (or more) offer, because that will give you the most bang for your buck. Really. So for clothes at 50%+ off and extra percentages on top of that, there is no better place. Their 'buy one get one free' offers are also pretty good too.

*[eBay](http://www.ebay.com.au/):* Really only good if you know what you're doing, want Asian-flavoured clothing, or are just checking on prices. It's usually good to stay away from eBay, and be wary of buying from Chinese sellers. Hong Kong sellers are usually better, because Chinese sellers often do not have an option to track your package, which can get infuriating when it arrives a month later.

When searching, select the ""sort by: lowest price + postage"" option, and select the ""buy it now"" tab from the top. This will avoid you looking for something that may seem cheap at first, but with $20 dollars of shipping tacked onto it, may not seem so worth it any more. You'll need PayPal and an eBay account to buy from there.

*[Cotton On](http://us.cottonon.com/):* Cotton On is an Australian brand which does have a US and Asian online store as well. For America, there is free shipping for orders over $45. Sales are on all the time too, but it is good to check often, since there are often little 'fire sales' where clothes are mysteriously discounted to a very cheap level a few times a year. 

For example, I've picked up $2 pairs of shoes, $5 shirts and $5 shorts just by waiting for these. Only really good if you buy during these sales, since the quality is fairly average. Slim fit trackies are worth buying, I personally love mine. The shoes are of a dubious quality, though.

*[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/):* Probably only good for you Americans out there. I've had no personal experience, but it's there as a resource indeed. 

This is just a very, very basic introduction to online shopping. For more websites or information, i'm always around or just PM me for help. Almost all of my clothes are from online shopping, and so far, I've found it's an easy way to replace your wardrobe without maximum effort. 

Just make sure you buy things of good quality (i.e. search online for brands/specific pieces that you know are good) and you protect yourself when buying and don't spend too much in one go. Use and abuse the sales, and enjoy yourself. It's easy to post links to friends or here for help and advice on pieces you might consider buying. 


**EDIT**

&gt;That worked out fine until c9b left, but now most activities that should be mod-run (GD, WAYWT) are being run by hazardouscat0. Why not remove all inactive mods and hold a vote for ~2 new mods? I don't know what tradition exists here, but if you are admitting yourself that most of the mods are inactive, then why do they need to remain mods? Even mods on MFA switch around with some frequency after being inactive. I would expect hazardouscat0 to win at least one of those positions and the other could be filled by someone that the community thinks is a good, consistent contributor.

Before we start, please note these examples under this line of text are just examples, not something you must follow. If you follow them great, if you don't like them choose stuff by yourself. There are tons to choose from. And please, choose stuff that most fits your environment i.e. if the Fall is damn cold in your country choose Thermal Long Sleeve tee instead of a long sleeve tee. Or when the Fall is pretty rain-y choose rain boots instead of the Authentics.
******
* **Colours**

Please, refer to MFA's [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ginj6/in_which_epicviking_teaches_you_how_to_match/) to matching colors. TL;DR the colors of Fall are lodens, chocolates, burgundies, and forest greens. All of examples are not choosen in Fall's colors. Decide which ones you want. The brown pallet of colors rules throughout the Fall.
  
* **Layering**

Try to ""stack"" clothes like this - a tee, a cardigan and a parka. Everytime you go to warmer enviroment take 1 or 2 layers down, depending on the temperature. 

*****
* **Tops**

The temperature is getting low, it's time to throw away all the short sleeved tees and get long sleeved tees, or if the temperature is really low get the thermal tees. 

* Long Sleeve tee - [AA](http://store.americanapparel.eu/2007.html) , H&amp;amp;amp;M, Zara

* [Thermal Long Sleeve tee](http://store.americanapparel.eu/t407.html)

* [Henley](http://store.americanapparel.eu/t457.html)

******
* **Jackets**

You're looking for something very simple with very clean design. Gray, olive, navy and brown 
are the most versatile colors. If the fall is colder take the Harrington jacket, it's recommended by MFA, Hooded Jacket comes after that and for the least cold Falls is Parka. Look for something lightweight and waterproof. Avoid over-branding

* [Parka](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/071562) - The example features UNIQLO's checked light cotton parka.

* [Hooded Jacket](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Fishermans-Jacket/xqeib/?iid=2046378&amp;amp;amp;cid=3606&amp;amp;amp;Rf914=3472,2596&amp;amp;amp;sh=0&amp;amp;amp;pge=0&amp;amp;amp;pgesize=20&amp;amp;amp;sort=-1&amp;amp;amp;clr=Khaki&amp;amp;amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1LaGFraS1KYWNrZXQvUHJvZC8.) - The hooded jacket from ASOS, it's pretty cheap ( 40 pounds ) so I can't guarantee the quality, it's worth checking out, though.

* [Harrington Jacket](http://www.baracuta-g9.com/G9-Slim-Fit-Made-In-England/G9S043160/5051235838840/f) - This classic harrington jacket isn't cheap but the quality is top notch and they do have some discounts right now

******
* **Sweaters**


Again, you're looking for something really simple and the most versatile colors are navys, greys, burgandies, tans. The most casual piece of this section is a hoodie. The second one comes crew neck and the last or the most formal is V neck. Again, avoid over-branding

* Sweater - [UNIQLO V Neck](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/072551), [UNIQLO Crew Neck](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/072551), [AA](http://store.americanapparel.eu/men-sweaters.html)

* Cardigan - [AA](http://store.americanapparel.eu/rsa4400.html), [UNIQLO](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/072551), H&amp;amp;amp;M

* [Hoodie](http://store.americanapparel.eu/search.html?r=&amp;amp;amp;as=&amp;amp;amp;s=hoodie)
  
*******
* **Pants**

Jeans, chinos and/or chords are the only pants you will need throughout the Fall. Make sure the thin strips on cords are small. The cords examples feature J.Crew's Slim-Straight cords in various colors and J.Crew's 484 fit cords. The 484 fit chords have the same fit as Levi's and they do have higher quality than Levi's. If you want jeans and live in the US buy Levi's 511, if you live outside the US buy UNIQLO's. Levi's are too expensive and most of the time not worth it. Look for UNIQLO's [Made in Japan raw denim](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/070931) jeans, they cost 70 pounds, it's regular fit and the quality is great. If possible avoid fake fades and holes, unless want an immature look. Avoid bright colors of chinos. Colors as always, go for brown, olive etc. If you're not a fan of cords or chinos you can always go for colored denim, moleskin, cotton duck or wool pans.

* [Brown Chinos](http://gb.dockers.com/en/shop/products/male-Bottoms-Long-Bottoms/ALPHA-KHAKI-Garment-Dye-44582-0140.html)

* [J.Crew 484 fit cords](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/pants/cord/PRDOVR~20582/20582.jsp)

  ******
* **Shoes**

Depending on where you live, the Authentics should last you 'till the late Fall. Rain boots are less fashionable than the Authentics and Clarks DB, but they offer more comfort, they're water-proof and more warmth. Choose according to your weather.

* Vans Authentics

* Clarks DB

* [Rain boots](http://store.tretorn.com/skerry-vinter/p/47238503/)

*****
* **Accessories**

It's getting colder so put away your no-show socks and get warmer socks. Please note, most of these socks might be too warm for you, the best idea is to go to a nearest store (H&amp;amp;M, Zara, Uniqlo, AA, etc.) and get woolen socks. Get yourself a scarf and a pair of gloves for windy and cold Fall days. If you're younger peer, definitely don't get leather gloves. Avoid synthetic scarf and instead get cashmere, silk and wool blends. Don't buy too thin scarf, the only exception are a longer scarfs you can fold.

* [Scarf](http://store.americanapparel.eu/6445.html) - Start with chorchoal and tan, add some textures afterwards.

******
* **Caps**

As with everything, you're looking for something really simple. Don't be afraid to be a little more adventurous with colors ! In the end, we're teenagers so we can get away with a lot of things and a little more contrast is okay to have. Here we have 2 hats - the first one is more adventurous, orange hat with a badge at its bottom. It should keep your head warm and happy during the coldest Fall's days. The second one is more safe, two color variations on this one and that's burgundy/cream and navy/burgundy. Two horizontal stripes run across the bottom of this cap. Again, happy and warm head. The last one is an acrylic hat, it should provide solid protection against cold  and windy days.

I made this because so many people don't know where to start when they want to dress well and waste money. As the title says, this is a guide so that you can replace your current wardrobe **but this is basic.** Read the comments in this thread as much of it will be advice.

**Shirts:**

[Merona 3 pack V Neck tees](http://www.target.com/p/merona-men-s-3pack-v-neck-tee-white/-/A-12279245#?lnk=sc_qi_detaillink)

These fit slim and are great shirts that can replaced for cheap.

2x [Mossimo 3/4 Henley Raglans](http://www.target.com/p/mossimo-supply-co-men-s-tee-assorted-colors/-/A-14060511#?lnk=sc_qi_detaillink) 

Raglans like this come in and out of fashion often. I recommend this shirt in both red/white and blue/grey. They're nice shirts and also easily replaceable. 

2x [Land's End Canvas Chambray Shirt](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-guildsman-chambray-workshirt~235398_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::UG8&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_men-_-shirts-&amp;origin=index)

Chambray is a great, classic material. I recommend the Deep indigo and Natural colors. Get them while they are still reduced.

**Jacket:**

[BDG Zip-Up Sweatshirt](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=20415089&amp;parentid=M_APP_HOODIESTRACK&amp;color=031) 

This is your basic sweatshirt. I recommend the red or blue colors.

OR

[American Apparel Zip-Up Sweatshirt](http://store.americanapparel.net/f497.html)

Also a basic sweatshirt for those who don't like the speckled look. 
 
**Pants:** 
[Levi's 511 Rigid Dragons](http://www.kohls.com/upgrade/webstore/product_page.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524892380691&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374757581987&amp;searchTerm=rigid+dragon&amp;bmUID=1342621739153)

These fit a little slim and have a strait cut opening on the pants. If you want fades, follow the [Denim guide.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/gtbv4/a_notsoquick_denim_guide/) 

[Dockers Alpha Khaki New British](http://us.dockers.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11593623&amp;cp=2271557.11818030&amp;parentPage=family) 

These are a little pricey, but can last forever with proper care and are the only khakis you will ever need. They fit more like Levi's 513 and have heavy stitching.

 **Shoes**

[Vans Canvas Authentic](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/41$.html?categoryId=10147&amp;colorCode=QER6LS#variation-2) 

These are your basic Vans. I recommend the Khaki or Grey colors.

OR

[Vans Canvas Era](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/53$.html?vcategoryId=PDPZ1&amp;cm_vc=PDPZ1#variation-3)

I recommend the same colors for these as the Authentic. I also recommend the true white.

**Total before shipping/taxes: $309**

1361060712.0,22,self.TeenMFA,18nylb,Utilitarian kit 1: Spring booster pack/Summer preparation,25,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/18nylb/utilitarian_kit_1_spring_booster_packsummer/,"So I figured I wanted to do a little bit of contributing and figured a spring basics and additions kit with useful clothing would be cool. I have some odd preferences in here, but please note that this is as much for inspiration as it is for a buying guide. 

First of all, the sun is back out. Pick you up some of the original aviator brand [aviators](http://www.ebay.com/itm/POLARIZED-AO-AMERICAN-OPTICAL-ORIGINAL-PILOT-AVIATOR-SUNGLASSES-52mm-55mm-57mm-/261082353267). They're a great fit on almost everyone, they're durable, and they're polarized. 

[Chambray](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-chambray-long-sleeve-shirt/075397-65-006). If you don't already know, educate yo' self on the most versatile shirt you can own. It's pretty lightweight, and can be layered as well as dressed up slightly (not much btdubs). 

[Linen checks](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-premium-linen-check-long-sleeve-shirt/076329001-65-004). Once again, versatile and lightweight, but probably only a 2 season shirt. I love the feel of these in the summer heat. 

Stripes. Personally, Spring to me screams stripes. I love polos with a good set of stripes, but I prefer the ones that accentuate the male figure. I.E., something that lacks stripes towards the top such as [these](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-washed-pique-striped-short-sleeve-polo-shirt/071231-69-006). 

Striped T-shirts are also nice during the summer. I have a firm belief that the look requires it to be a pocket-tee for stripes, but whatever floats your boat. If you want to splurge a bit, [J. Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/graphicandstripetees/PRDOVR~33269/99102888224/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~20+16+4294967276~15~~~~~~~/33269.jsp) has some of my favorite stripe-es on sale right now. Otherwise, just go to target. Avoid more than 3 colors of stripes, and stick to basic neutral colors for a base for the most part. 

I don't care who says it's okay to wear cargo shorts. If you wear them, most will say you look like a child, and not in the good way. Buy [flat front shorts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-chino-shorts/071148-00). Stick to basic colors here unless you want to look like a frat boy. Consider shirts and shoes you own when picking a color. If you want some shorter ones, J. Crew is having a sale on all their shorts right now, but once again, you will spend more. 

The short-sleeve henley! Quite possibly the closest thing you can get to not wearing a shirt in the spring (other than tank tops, but don't wear those unless you have the guns and chest to pull it off). Target has some. These can come off as very childish sometimes, so be your own judge there. 

Espadrilles are a great alternative to barefoot (if that's your thing). [Soludos](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men) is the only way to go, otherwise you're buying garbage. J.crew also has some [collab](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shoes/ESPADRILLES/PRDOVR~87653/87653.jsp) espadrilles with soludos. 

Some side notes to add are that you probably own a pair of Vans and probably are going to not wear socks. Pick up some of [these](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/accessories/socks/PRDOVR~10089/10089.jsp) bad boys so your shoes don't smell like your room probably does. 

Accessories are also very valuable during these seasons as they stand out more with less fabric on. If you have a watch, stop by [Crown and Buckle](http://www.crownandbuckle.com/) and pick up some straps. It keeps your watch straps from getting destroyed and smelling from repeated use.

Backpacks are great to have during these next two seasons. They offer chances to pack all your shit in places you would have kept in your extra cargo pockets. Sign up over at [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/) and get a decent pack. 

Disclaimer: This is not a command, just my take on a spring/summer style option. It is also not a complete wardrobe, and I rely on the fact that you probably have basics.

I won't ignore the fact that there's [already a spring and summer guide for teens](http://redd.it/pq1m2) but i will add on to what i believe it missed out on.

**Shirts**

Your summer shirts should consist of lightweight shirts such as linen. Cotton, poplin and oxford is fine as well.  The types of shirts you'll be wearing is tanktops, [crewneck](http://i.imgur.com/tUCht.jpg)/v neck,[ocbd](http://i.imgur.com/4kOP2.jpg),[polos](http://i.imgur.com/CMn5l.jpg) and even [chambray](http://i.imgur.com/YnNjY.jpg) or [denim shirts](http://i.imgur.com/m3GPh.jpg). As far as color goes, you want to keep the colors to a lighter range of hues. Almost like a pastel shade. [Whites](http://i.imgur.com/1AQBq.jpg), [light pinks](http://i.imgur.com/TlCB0.jpg), [light blues](http://i.imgur.com/Tbyzo.jpg), yellow, pretty much any light color you can think of will go nicely in hot weather. Patterns to wear: Windowpane, gingham, madras, prints ([floral](http://i.imgur.com/Aqvoc.jpg), images, [weird stuff](http://www.unionmadegoods.com/gitman_vintage_Girl_Camp_2_Button_Down_7878.html)), candy stripe (and other versions of this). Short sleeved button up/downs are nice, but for long-sleeved, roll up the sleeves.

-Tanktops. If it's super hot and a t-shirt is too much, wear a tank top! These are super nice to wear when you're about to go to the beach or just chillin outside with your friends. Get colors in light, pastel hues. Note: Wife-beaters =/= tanktops. Wearing one in place of a tanktop looks douchey.

**Bottoms**

If you were like me, shorts aren't really your thing. And that's cool! Just because it's sunny or a little hot doesn't mean you *have* to wear shorts. Alternatives to shorts are chinos, lightweight jeans, [raw denim](http://i.imgur.com/NmD9YgO.jpg) (if you can stand it), or even [cropped] [pants](http://im.uniqlo.com/images/us/pc/goods/072040/sub/072040_sub2.jpg). But if you're like the new me, and shorts *are * your thing, here's some advice to keep in mind: Keep your short's length on or above the knee. Anything else looks baggy or just unflattering. [Short short](http://i.imgur.com/42JeV.jpg)s are cool, but expect to be called out on it. Gotta have the confidence to rock em. Get your shorts in versatile colors like [khaki](http://i.imgur.com/iwpp8.jpg), [navy](http://i.imgur.com/4kOP2.jpg), white then go to variety like [brick](http://i.imgur.com/um5MI.jpg), mint, and [brown](http://i.imgur.com/txPvL.jpg). Same for chinos. Also if you're up for some craziness, go for [patterned](http://i.imgur.com/0rMrL.jpg) shorts!

**Shoes**

Aah shoes. My favorite subject. I absolutely love almost all my shoes in summer. As mentioned in the other guide, you can wear your shoes sockless! or if that's gross for you, you can wear [loafer socks](http://i.imgur.com/si83JPt.jpg). This is when you'll want to pull out any low top canvas shoes like converse, [vans](http://i.imgur.com/Cgivp.jpg) or keds in colors like [white](http://i.imgur.com/uJvU8.jpg), navy, or [ maroon.](http://i.imgur.com/c4enJ.jpg) Add [leather laces](http://imgur.com/a/1XQaG) if you'd like. Looks cool bro. You can pick up a pair of [camo](http://i.imgur.com/hYqTlh.jpg) plimsolls as mentioned last summer. Boat shoes are super easy to rock, but avoid wearing them with pants as I feel it looks try-hard. Get some in oatmeal [sahara](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-sahara) [dark brown](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-classic-brown) or navy. **Avoid the vans/boat shoe hybrid.** *Yuck.* Other types of shoes to wear in summer is [penny loafers](http://i.imgur.com/jcFbQ.jpg),[white bucks](http://i.imgur.com/ltp7g.jpg), [longwings](http://i.imgur.com/aLjPY.jpg)(I know those aren't longwings but you get the idea), [espadrilles](http://i.imgur.com/fxSt0.jpg)[2](http://i.imgur.com/7OBBj.jpg) or [white hightops](http://i.imgur.com/hu03Jh.jpg). (with pants of course). GATs are also a really cool summer shoe.

Limit flip flops to the beach.


**Hats**. I don't like them. At all. So I never bothered to learn the rules about them. If you must read about them, then here:
&gt;As you're a teenager you can still make flat brim caps look good, try not to leave the brim perfectly flat though add a little bend. Try and buy a hat with a color that will be able to go with most of you're outfits but if you're only going to buy one hat don't make it a black hat. Short brimmed snapbacks also look good when going to the beach just see what you like. But remember don't wear the same hat everyday therefor if you only have one try wearing it once or twice a week at most, even if you have more make sure you're not wearing one everyday try to not wear one more often then you do. Also snapbacks are a really good choice if they fit you properly as they are coming back into style.

**Accessories** If you feel the need to wear something other than pants,shoes and a shirt, throw a couple accessories in. Wooden beaded bracelets are cool as well as leather braided ones. Avoid the Yellow jelly bracelets with the ARMSTRONG on the band. Also avoid having your wrists drown in bracelets. A watch such as the Timex Weekender or easy reader would be nice for everyday wear. Necklaces are okay, but not recommended. 

**Sunglasses** I recommend getting a cheap pair of [wayfayers](http://i.imgur.com/6SaYK.jpg) or [clubmasters](http://i.imgur.com/e3KOK.jpg) on amazon. They're cheap and if they break, oh well they were ~$5. I'm not saying to only get cheap ones. If you have a pair of ray-bans and you paid full price, that's fine. I just don't recommend you buy them full price. Avoid the [mirrored aviators.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RYrGUa3Ovr8/SQhaCgfanaI/AAAAAAAAAk8/JAxeeIXtUXk/s400/closetdvbmirroredaviators.bmp) Get them in colors like black or [tortoise. ](http://i.imgur.com/0i2xI.jpg)

Backpacks are easily the most used item in your wardrobe. The best part is that they are like bonus questions on a quiz, they *rarely* hurt you, but can add to your look if done right! Backpacks should be of quality materials, fine aesthetics and convenient. 

**Things to avoid**
 
* Roller backpacks - They make you look 5. Please don't do this. I'm sure if you're subscribed to this sub-reddit, you wouldn't. I see it quite a bit at my school.  
   
* [Pull String Bags](http://www.pinupbags.com.au/Backpacks/gym_pack.jpg) - These will almost always not give you enough room for your things, be extremely unorganized or be uncomfortable when running to class. 
  
* [Mesh/See through](http://assets.academy.com/mgen/10/10043910.jpg?is=500,500) - These just look bad. They offer no protection if something were to spill or if it started raining and you were out with this.
 
* [Swiss Army Bags](http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/500/10393071.jpg) -These are like the cargo shorts of backpacks. You think you can go to school with this because it has pockets for everything, but they just look clunky and you end up being unorganized.
  
* [neon](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8xlm6CMLU1qm11a2o1_500.jpg) -Far too flashy and bright for any outfit or blending into highschool/middleschool. They look quite feminine as well.
  
* Drawing/writing all over your bag. - Looks childish, like you don't care about the materials. Avoid witty phrases, "" 'x' was here lol"" and yolo  (This part doesn't really matter, but c'mon)
  
* Messenger bags - Not easy to run to class/bike to school with. Hard to keep everything together. Acceptable if you have a laptop, but be warned that MBs can cause shoulder problems.


**OKAY THE ACTUAL INFORMATION PART OF THE GUIDE HERE WE GO okay**

Sleek bags are awesome.  A safe option is to go for backpacks like 
 
* [Herschel Pop Quiz Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=22634638&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Rucksack inspired bags like Herschel Little America Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=22634752&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [The ones with the leather patch, a classic. Herschel Supply Co. Heritage Backpack ](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=26020115&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Simple, contrast. Herschel Supply Co. Settlement Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=21290762&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Simple Textbook backpacks. O'Hanlon Mills Textbook Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=24446429&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Prints, just like on shirts/hats, are super cool. ](http://i.imgur.com/Orxgg.jpg)'

* [Everlane's bags are super cool](http://i.imgur.com/dcWjq.jpg) (I mean both the regular back and the snap backpack.)
  

Your backpack should be enough to fit your school supplies, a laptop and a light jacket. If it can fit more, it's probably huge and clunky looking. If it can't fit that, (even without the jacket) then it's too small. 
 

Feel free to add anything I've missed.

1. Wear clothes that fit you, *always*. 

2. Having a smaller wardrobe of expensive clothes is better than having a much larger wardrobe of cheap clothes.

3. There are many teens who wear nice slim fit pants/jeans but there are few that I have seen that can pull of nice shorts. So my advice for shorts is that you wear something that is similar to chino flat front shorts.

I've lost thirty pounds, got a bit more muscular and have been getting compliments which has really brightened my self-esteem. Now that I actually look decent, I figure it's a good time to get some good clothing.

Only problem is that my wardrobe is still pretty lousy. Baggy clothes, stuff that doesn't match, graphic tee's, etc. I've been reading through some things and was wondering what would make me look good. Keep in mind I'm 15, so I don't want to come off as pretentious at school or anything. I just want to look neat and like I know what I'm doing.

So, from what I've gathered, I should be looking for solid colors, simple patterns, v-necks, and button-ups? What else? Also, what about pants? I've pretty much been exclusively wearing jeans. Different shades and everything, but just jeans. Is that alright or should I be looking for something else as well?

Anyway, to get to the topic of the post, I want some skating shoes that will match my attire. I skate a LOT, to the point where I carry a skateboard/penny wherever I go (penny in places like a towncenter, or campus, or skating to a friends, skateboard just for going around with friends).

I also LOVE the outstanding color red in shoes, so I was thinking shoes like [this](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/zoom-mogan-mid-2-shoe/pid-716314/pgid-780763) or [this](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/sb-paul-rodriguez-7-low-premium-shoe/pid-728690/pgid-728691).

Also, for general wear, I was thinking some shoes that look like [this](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/jordan-dominate-pro-training-shoe/pid-684465/pgid-684467) would be nice? I'm generally always wearing jeans (loose fit, but not saggy, and always a belt) and either a darker top, or a completely white top with a minimalistic graphic on it. I also generally have a hoodie on (either [darker green like this](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=42805813), or [lighter grey like this with my darker tops](http://www.pistolclothing.com.au/TShirt_images/hoodie-sports-grey-front0902242206006037.jpg).

**What Is Raw Denim**
    
Raw denim explained in the simplest explanation is denim that has not went through the washing process when being manufactured. The washing process is to shrink the denim to prevent later shrinkage. It also helps to soften the material. This is why raw denim is very stiff and it is encouraged that you soak before wearing it.
 

 
**Other Stuff About Raw Denim**

* Materials- Usually raw denim is 100% cotton. The cotton's country of origin varies(Japanese).

* Fit- The fit of the pants will vary with the brands. Most brands have a wide range of different types of fits.

* Weight- The weight is called denim weight. The weight of the denim is measured in ounces. There are three categories of weight: Light, Medium, and Heavy weight. Light is usually 12 oz. and under, Medium is 12-16 oz, and Heavy is 16 oz and up.  

* Selvedge- This is something you might not notice at first but is a really nice addition to you denim. Selvedge denim forms a clean natural edge on the out-seam.
 
 
 
Now after reading all this text you're probably wondering why the hell you should care about if your denim is raw or not.
 
***This is why.***
 
* Raw denim is a great value. Because of the weight of the denim and not being washed nearly as often as washed denim you are able to wear it for an extremely long amount of time. Your jeans slowly become a part of you as you wear them

* Your jeans become apart of you! As you wear them fades, other marks, and maybe eventually rips start to appear on your denim. The fades are one of a kind and will develop based on what you do when you wear them. Ride bikes a lot? You will probably get some gnarly butt fade from the seat. Carry a odd shaped wallet? It will fade its shape into the pocket.
 
 
 
***Brands***
There are tons of brands that make raw denim, some more notable brands include(in no specific order) Naked &amp; Famous, Acne, 3sixteen, A.P.C., Flat Head, Iron Heart, Unbranded(Made by N&amp;F), and Samurai.
    There is also multiple places that you can purchase raw denim. With a quick Google search you can find online shops that sell most of these brands.

That being said, I'm curious as to how you guys like your Chucks. High top or low top? Which colors do you think are most versatile? What do you think of the monochrome or leather ones? Would you ever go for more out-there colors or perhaps a pattern or two? Do you ever coordinate your Chucks with the rest of your outfit?

* Jeans or Khakis

* Can wear either polos or school-approved shirts (e.g. A club or sport shirt) that are in the school's colors (In this case, red, white, &amp; blue)
* Must have belt

So under these guidelines, what would you guys wear? What accessories, if any?

These are the only clothes I have that are applicable to these rules. As you see, I only have baseball shirts- Which gets quite redundant.

I'm probably this subreddit's worst nightmare. I'm going into my senior year of HS and I've never once considered fashion. I'm looking for ways to improve what has come to  be my ""trademark"" (probably in the bad sense) look. Sorry for the wall of text.

I'm 6'3 and weigh 130, so I'm pretty lanky. I'm also as pale as they come, and I've heard that plays a role in one's fashion decisions. I've worn the same thing every day since 6th grade: Grey slacks, running shoes, some sort of colorful, nerdy shirt, and a Patagonia better sweater ([pic](http://www.surfstitch.com/product_images/25526STH-PATAGONIA-1.JPG)). I know, I'm sorry. As of now, I have 4 pairs of grey slacks and probably around 6 Patagonia sweaters of different varieties. 

I rather like the whole shirt and slacks thing - it seems to fit my frame well - but I definitely want to find the way to make it look better. I'm open to any changes in shoes (size 14 in nearly everything), sweaters, type of slacks, shirt brands, coats, whatever. Wow, I've realized the shoes are really, really bad. They're bright green running shoes and I don't run.

The main two things I'm looking for are:  

*A source of good quality, well-fitted T-shirts with interesting/odd/(dare I say hipster?) designs

*A coat, along the lines of a peacoat, that will fit my length and help guard against the elements in my new home (Seattle or London, likely). I really like Sherlock's coat ([pic1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5hIrmjR9WRc/TuNeNOrOCjI/AAAAAAAAAtc/LECljgGROQ8/s1600/1069291-low_res-sherlock.jpg), [pic2](http://www.fhm.com/App_Media/Uploads/Images/Original/image/sherlock-coat-main.jpg), [pic3](http://www.dorkadore.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Sherlock_Holmes_coat.jpg)), but  I've had no luck in finding something similar to fit me that doesn't look quite so... stark.

I live in California right now (I'll have to order any of this online as I live in a tiny town), but I'll be moving to either London or Seattle soon for college.

Our sidebar is a little out of date, so it's being expanded and upgraded. So far:

We'd also like your input to anything you would like to see in the sidebar, or anything in general as to where you think this subreddit should go.

I guess you could say Autumn is about a month away, and stores are going to be having their fall wardrobes brought in, so I thought I could help YOU shop around a bit in preparation for the new season and the new school year. I thought I would try to present many options and variations so that it would give you more then one outfit, and I will try my best to incorporate some general rules of thumb here and there. Also note: I won’t try to break the bank, but you have to understand that Fall is one of the most expensive seasons to shop in, so bear with me. (I’ll be heading a lot to H&amp;M as I feel like they are offer good fit and quality at a very reasonable price. Also because I live next to one.)


**First off: Colours!**


As a general rule, I like to think that you match the colour of your clothes with the colour of your surroundings. In Autumn you’re going to want to wear a rustic, cool palette in most cases. Reds can be brought down to burgundy, and forest greens will be preferable to, say, lime. You’ll also want to try and incorporate more browns, creams especially, and bring in gray as well.


General advice on Autumn:


Autumn isn’t a time to flaunt your fashionista self. It isn’t a time to wear deep pink v-necks and exotic colour combinations with weird accessories. You want to stay modest yet sophisticated and feel natural in the environment and climate. Autumn is also all about layers. Both practically and fashionably. Blend your chocolates, charcoals, and coffees with a touch of colour before heading out and you’ll be good to go!

So let’s get started shall we?




**Bottom layer:**


-Your bottom layer like most days, will be a t shirt. It’s still a staple no matter what season, but this time try and opt for [tri-blend shirts](http://store.americanapparel.net/tr401.html), or [peppered shirts](
http://www.hm.com/us/product/92433?article=92433-V#article=92433-T) as they work with a less vivid, more cooler palette. 



-Buttoned shirts also work if you want to find a medium between a sweatshirt/sweater and t shirt. Remember to always get a long-sleeve in the fall/winter, and roll up the sleeves as you wish (but I would recommend a little more then half way up on your forearm). Putting a little pattern in your outfit is nice, and since t shirts, sweatshirts, and coats will mostly be solid, a [checkered button long sleeve](http://www.hm.com/us/product/00922?article=00922-A#article=00922-B) will go a long way. [Alternative](http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/us/en/zara-us-S2012-s/244945/629542/RAGLAN%2BSLEEVE%2BSHIRT)




**Middle layer:**



-For the majority of cases, this is going to be one of two options. A sweater or a sweatshirt. I personally prefer pullovers for my middle layer since I find it a bit awkward to have 2 sets of zippers with your coat, but its not breaking any major rules by any means. Cardigans are another thing I like to stay away from in the fall, but by no means rule them out if YOU think you can pull it off. Patterns are going to be hard to find for your middle layer, so try to make up for it in fabric and texture if you feel like your outfit is feeling a bit flat. However [cotton crewneck pullover sweaters](http://www.clubmonaco.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12473698) are great for almost all occasions.

[Option](http://www.hm.com/us/product/01538?article=01538-C)
[Option](http://store.americanapparel.net/mt497.html?c=Peppered%20Cranberry)



**Outerwear:** 



-In a sense, this is the most important piece of your Autumn outfit. Not only because its what you will be seen in for almost the entirety of your day (or at least the time you spend outside), but because its the most expensive piece of clothing you will own, and there is nothing like owning a quality, good looking coat that will last you forever. Adults can wear a piece of outerwear for 15+ years. Generally, I like to go for*waxed cotton, since it’s versatile, comes in a lot of styles, and is relatively easy to pull off. Just be careful of too many pockets, and the fit of your coat. Its a coat, but make sure it still fits. Stay away from trenches and leather, and try to find a darker brown, navy, or charcoal colour. Its standard, but it works. Finally, take into account the climate where you live. You don’t want a coat that’s too heavy, when you know you won’t be getting gusty winds or snow, and vice versa.
 Let me say this again, you WON’T want to cheap out on this, but of course I will try and find reasonably affordable options.

[$220](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_feature/NewArrivals/outerwear/PRDOVR~96051/96051.jsp)



**Pantalons:**




-Shorts are out of the question, but jeans NEVER are. Nothing wrong with some [Levi 511‘s](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11587057&amp;
) in a darker wash. Also note, like outerwear, a good pair of jeans will go a long way. Buying a great pair of $80 Levi 511’s will pay off dividends in the future, and sorry to state the obvious, but jeans will never, ever, ever go out of style or season so it’s money well spent.

-[Chinos](http://www.hm.com/us/product/98847?article=98847-C) are also a safe bet, but stay within the yellow/brown colour palette, and make sure they fit just as well as your jeans do.

-I’m also personally a big fan of what H&amp;M calls [“pants”](http://www.hm.com/us/product/92068?article=92068-A#article=92068-D). (Go figure.) But they seem to be a jean style slim pant that come in a variety of colours. Try out a grey or chocolate colour to get something that still works great, but you wouldn’t find typically with a chino or jean.



**Shoes and other:**



-To be honest, for me the shoes don’t really change all that much. You can still pull off a darker boat shoe, and Vans are like the jeans of the pants realm, the plain tee of the shirt realm, and the white rice of the Asian food realm. You can never go wrong. However, like the rest of your outfit, don’t try anything too bold. Try out the [OTW](
http://www.vans.com/microsites/otw/ludlow.php) set from Vans, they carry a lot of fall themed colours in a variety of styles. 

-A watch really pulls together an outfit. Try and find something with a leather strap. If you dress with the clothes I’ve shown above, you can pull it off. Find one with a large, white face, and a leather strap. It shouldn’t be hard, but bonus points for one with gold accents (gold works great in Autumn, but unfortunately for teens its hard to incorporate)

-Belts for jeans should just stay leather, or at least a nicer canvas in charcoal or black. For us teens, a thicker belt works better then a thin one, and a darker leather is preferred over a lighter.

-Finally if you have a little extra dough to blow, pick up a cologne. Find something with relatively good longevity (online reviews and the assistant at your store can help you with that) since cologne lasts much shorter in cold environments then warm ones. Try and find something thats very easy to take in. (nothing too spicy or musky, you are in high school after all) but try and find something a woody tone. Nothing too watery or citrusy. Dior’s [Fahrenheit](http://www.amazon.com/FAHRENHEIT-Christian-Dior-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000143D54/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343486470&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=dior+farenheit) is what I would recommend for Fall days, but nothing compares to trying them yourself. Remember to NEVER over apply, you will be walking around school with hundreds of other people, you don’t want to be known as THAT guy. Once on the wrist, and once on the neck about 30 minutes before school, you want the ladies to discover it with a hug or over a coffee, not alert them of your presence.

**Closing comments:**

I’m not saying go BUY all these clothes. It’s expensive, I know. But I hope after reading this guide you at least have a sense of how to DRESS in Autumn. There are a few things you need to have, like jeans, t shirts, and a coat, but the rest you can really work into your outfit, even if you don’t have the ideal ingredients, and in many cases it could turn out better then what I have here.

If you think I should get them, is there any thing I should know about this type of shoe? (Only wear with jeans, don't wear with jeans, etc.)

For some background, I am a freshman, but most people usually assume I am a sophomore or junior because of my looks and maturity. While almost all of the teens my age still wear what they did in middle school, I do see juniors and seniors wearing nicer clothing and shoes, so I think I could pull these off.

 My jacket was recently stolen; Fortunately, I was in need of a new one anyway. I want something that is fairly light, that is fairly mute in colour, and that isn't too provocative or loud. 

   At the moment there are a number of styles that I'm thinking of. I think a jacket like this one seems good (in the navy colour):

http://www.nautica.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11766212&amp;cp=3619386.3026105&amp;s=A-UnitRank-NAU&amp;parentPage=family&amp;cid=1128661

The jacket seems nice and light, and isn't super bold or anything like that. I don't know if it's just the model, but it doesn't seem like a jacket that a younger person would wear. Thoughts?

Another consideration is to just get a hoodie like everyone else. I have nothing against them, but they're kinda boring. I really am not attracted to any of the graphic hoodies, so I would just be getting one with a basic pattern or solid colour.

My last thought was to get some kind of mega ordinary windbreaker like this:
 http://www.thebay.com/eng/mens-outerwear-Zip_Front_Rain_Jacket-thebay/249205

   A leather jacket will definitely not work. Things like peacoats and wool jackets look kinda cool, but definitely won't work for me or my demographic/peer group. If I found some kind of really cool track jacket I MIGHT get it. In general I'm not a big fan of casually wearing clothing that is intended for sport, in addition, most track jackets I've seen on others look kind of tacky.

Any opinions or ideas?

Thanks!

I've been here for about an hour and this is my first post, so be kind. :)
Next January, I've secured myself an internship at a renown German news outlet (not far from where I live, I live in Germany most of the time), one of their videos appeared on the front page a few days ago. So this is serious business.

I'll be 16 then, and our school pretty much obliges us to get an internship, so I decided to go for something big. The environment will be professional, and I'm not sure how they expect me to dress there. I'm inexperienced in dressing well, I only have experience in casual wear. I'm also on a slight budget...

The reason I'm asking now is because I'll be in the US the next few weeks, and alot of clothes are ridiculously cheaper there than in Europe. If any of you has some advice to give, it would be much appreciated, otherwise the wizards of MFA might be able to help.

I can post a pic of myself if needed, it's fairly late right now. I'm of average height and not chubby but not skinny, just so you know.

So it's time for me to get some new shoes, as [I'm not a fan of my old ones](http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/250/229344035.jpg) and they are kind of falling apart. There are a few pairs I'm looking at, but I'm becoming concerned about versatility because I have no money and my parents are pretty stingy so this may be my only pair for a few months, so I need something that will look good with shorts, long pants, and most colors as my only other backup is my aforementioned Pumas. Anyways, to the choices:

[Hiker Authentics](http://www.zumiez.com/vans-authentic-hiker-gargoyle-grey-skate-shoes.html?utm_source=google_product&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=400252&amp;utm_campaign=product_ads&amp;utm_content=pla&amp;gclid=CLCusKr3rLUCFQhxQgodJGoAcw) I like the laces here, leaning towards these but they're not very unique I feel like. ALso, the same shoe in red or green is 25 on [Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=25643081&amp;parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS), is it worth sacrificing the grey, and if so which color is best there?

[Vans Chukka Low](http://www.zumiez.com/shoes/guys-shoes/vans-shoes-chukka-low-tan-and-white-skate-shoe.html) these look really dope to me but I remember reading that they look bad with shorts and they're more expensive. Any Suggestions on colorways?

[New Balance 420s](http://www.karmaloop.com/product/The-New-Balance-x-Herschel-420-Sneaker-in-Red/328581) These are also more expensive and a bit eccentric but they have a certain charm to me and they seem to look a lot better on feet from pics.

I’m a short and skinny male and I need some help and advice on finding me the right fit for me. I usually wear Levi’s 511 jeans found in the children’s section of the department store; 28W &amp; 28L. Unfortunately for me, these sizes are very tough to find so I would have to travel to at least three surrounding malls to find the right size for me. Despite that, the selection of colors is very slim, no pun intended, compared to the men’s section. They only come in about three different colors, and yes you bet, I have all three of those colors as compared to the dozens of colors offered in the men’s section.

The men’s section of Levi’s in the department stores only come in at the minimum 29W &amp; 30L. Unfortunately for me, I’m not sure where or how I should get it hemmed or where the cutoff point should be to make it seem like a perfect fit. I recently had a pair of jeans hemmed and it was still very baggy at the ankle above my shoe, looked like air was blowing there. I don’t need a belt to hold the 29W pants up but they look really baggy compared to 28W. Any help?

I apologize if this sounds a bit confusing but it's kind of frustrating looking for jeans before school begins near the end of the month. Thanks for your help.

Tl;dr – need help finding the right fit for jeans by hemming… how should they fit and where should they land on the shoe? Photos are beneficial thanks, and yes I have checked out the FAQ.

The denim is in good shape and has only seen about a month of wear (they also haven't been washed yet, not a big deal unless you're a germaphobe).

Anyway... I've been lurking around here and other male fashion subreddits for a little while, and I just don't understand why everyone seems to be so opposed to visible undershirts. I mean, I understand if you're wearing a dress shirt, or if it's a paper-thin see-through white t-shirt and you're letting too much show. But what's wrong with matching a plain t-shirt with a casual shirt and making it part of your outfit? Or letting about an inch of white stick out over the top of your polo? Sometimes I like to wear plaid button-ups with a v-neck of a coordinating color underneath, with the top two or three buttons open. I think just so long as your undershirt isn't hanging out past the bottom of your outer shirt, and you don't leave too many buttons undone, it looks nice.

Teen MFA found me aimlessly wondering the internets a few months ago. Like your creepy neighbor Tom from across the street, I’ve poked my head in the window about every week or so since then to see what’s going on. I’ve been intrigued, bored, outraged, and brought to tears of both joy and disgust many times. I will also say that I’ve learned a hell of a lot from some of the posts and comments on the sub-reddit. Most of you are quite apt when it comes selecting bodily linens. However, I am tired of sitting back and watching. The bottom line is that I have come to appreciate this place too much to simply lurk. I must humbly ask for your attention for a few minutes so I can share my observations, thoughts, and opinions.  

General Observations/Thoughts

Unfortunately, there is an enormous difference between what is appropriate for a 13 or 14 year old and what is appropriate for an 18 or 19 year old. Since I come from the latter of those two groups, I will speak for that age range unless otherwise indicated.

When it comes to clothing, I firmly believe that you should opt toward the side of quality. If you can afford three Hondas, you can afford one Mercedes. Take the Mercedes. Know what I mean?

Branding

I generally hate branding, but branding is important. Confused? Let me explain. There is a difference between being a walking billboard and having a subtle indicator that you appreciate quality clothes. A great example is the classic Ralph Lauren polo vs. the “big pony” polo. One is obnoxious, pretentious, and downright ugly while the other is classy and well made. Don’t flaunt your brands, but wear them with a subdued sense of pride.

Ideas That Will Probably Piss You Off

I don’t like jeans as everyday casual wear. Jeans were invented as work pants, and I think they should be used as such. In addition to that, jeans are just too damn unremarkable. Stick to chinos or corduroys in natural colors. At the very least, don’t have jeans as your default pants choice. I challenge you to be different. 

Shoes

I think Vans and Nike sneakers are just fine and dandy for the younger teens on this page. However, nothing portrays maturity like a nicer leather shoe. Boat shoes are awesome. They can be worn with casual outfits, and at this age, we can probably get away with wearing a pair with a coat and tie. I recommend Sperrys. They are the original boat shoe, and most of the other brands come across as pretty copy-caty. Go with any shade of brown. They are just as affordable as any flashy, branded up Nike shoe, and they get better with age. They can be worn with no socks, but I personally like to match them white Nike mid-calves. Never wear dark socks with them. You will meet people who strongly oppose socks with Sperrys, but I think they provide a youthful twist to a timeless classic. I can’t push the Sperrys enough. Buy ‘em.

Ever heard of Bean Boots? They are great for the snow and rain and they look damn good too. They’ll last forever and the come from a great company with awesome customer service. Check them out.

Now I have to weigh in on desert boots/chukkas/others-of-the-sort, which a bunch of ya’ll seem to like. I am not a huge fan and this is why: They look too mature. I don’t see how a 15 year old kid could make CDBs work. I think they are a bit to “Dad” for people our age. Don’t throw yours out though; they are nice shoes and can probably look alright in the some circumstances.

Closing remarks

Wow, I only talked about shoes and I’m already damn tired. If you guys liked what I had to say, let me know because I’d love to talk about other things as well. I have a lot of good brands in mind that I don’t think most of you are taking advantage of. Take everything I said with a grain of salt. These are just my opinions; don’t stop wearing jeans just because of what some random guy wrote on the internet. Have a good one, and stay classy, TeenMFA.

Today is the 17th birthday, and I thought that this would be a good opportunity to ask for some fashion advice from my awesome internet peers.
  
[This is me] (http://i.imgur.com/1FNRQ1N.jpg) a week or two ago, basically all my clothes are non-brand-name hand-me-downs, so I am looking for some advice before considering replacing my wardrobe.  
Shirt - ""Quick Performance"" (seems to be a Taiwanese brand)  
Shorts - C.P. shorts, I tailored them to fit a little slimmer  
Shoes [1] (http://i.imgur.com/vLnssAs) [2] (http://i.imgur.com/E3RuGqr.jpg) - Hang Ten, also from Taiwan.  
Shades - no idea what brand they are.  
  
This is today, [with cardigan] ( http://imgur.com/a/Jvhye) and [without cardigan] (http://i.imgur.com/a/VrJQi).  
Shirt - The label is in Chinese, can't tell what it is. From Taiwan.  
Pants - ""ProKennex"". Cuffs or no cuffs?  
Cardigan - ""Sanjia"". It is at least a size too big, what do you think?  
  
About me - I am 5'3"", 104lb, I prefer slim but not skinny fits, as I am small &amp; skinny for my age. Also, I borrowed my sister's room (and mirror) to take these pictures, that ain't my room!

I am 5'8 and about 135lbs, so not skinny but not fat. I have broad shoulders even for a trans guy, so they're not *horribly* baggy, but they're not the fit that you guys always tell me to go for. The t-shirts fit okay, but some of the shirts are a bit too obviously big for me. Should I throw out/donate all of these shirts and start over? 

edit: I should also add that over the summer I plan to work out and drop some weight as well as gain some muscle. I like my shirts a little baggy and not exactly tight fitting, but I don't want to look like I'm some gang member from Compton.

Alrighty TeenMFA, first post here! I'm in the market for a new backpack. Of course i'm slightly on the brand side so I'm not gonna go out and pick up a walmart backpack and roll with it. I like crumpler and this is the cheapest and best backpack to fit my needs. What are your opinions on it? Here's some pictures on actual people

(sorry too lazy to learn how to link and stuff)


Is it nice?  Should I pick it up. If not, any other nice backpack recommendations that are &lt;$75? I must say that i'm not a fan of TNF because it's huuuuge popularity at my school..
