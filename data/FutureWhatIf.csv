I decided to rely heavily on what I know about current political unions, and upcoming unions.


In Asia, I imagine that Russia has balkanized due to rampant corruption and political in-fighting, with a fundamentalist Christian state forming around the Ural Mountains. China has lost some territory after the DPRK collapses, and Japan regained some of its former Empire. Earlier in the century, Mongolia discovered a treasure trove of mineral resources which jump started its economy. A South East Asian Union (ASEAN) emerges in response to China's territoriality. After a brief nuclear exchange in the 2030's, India claims Pakistan as part of its territory. Bangladesh unionizes with India after it receives heavy aid as a result of dramatic climate change ravaging the country.


In the Middle East, Iran remains the same geographically despite having gone through major social and political reform in the 2020's.The Central Asian Block is formed after Russia collapses, in response to political pressure from all sides. After decades of religious turmoil and sectarian violence, and partly in response to a dramatically more powerful Turkish Union, a Caliphate is created to run a Pan-Arabic Union. It started with the countries of the Arabic Peninsula, and slowly spreads through North Africa, and the rest of the Levant.

The EU has finally federalized after adding a few more countries and sorting out the financial crisis earlier in the century. The Scandinavian  Union forms purely due to their unique liberal social policies.

The East African Federation is formed in 2018. In the rest of Africa, after years of steady economic development and Chinese aid, other Unions are formed: The (Christian) Nigerian States of West Africa, and Greater South Africa.

In the Americas, South America federalized fairly early in the century, and has remained a prominent global power since. In response, the Caribbean States of America are formed out of Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico, over the years has seriously developed economically; even rivaling the United States and Canada. As a gesture of goodwill, and due to changing ethnic backgrounds of the American Southwest, Southern California (south of LA), Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas are ceded to Mexico.

It involves no collaborators to betray you or provide traceable communication. Planning (acquire gun &amp; ammunition, pick target) are activities with innocent explanations. It's hard to prove that a hunter or a mall shopper is planning a shooting spree attack. Someone messing around in the woods with explosives is a different matter.

The pentagon considers the situation and then finally decides to assign massive amounts of funding towards research into how they could create the very best infantry units that they possibly can.

What kind of super-soldiers are they likely to be able to get?

What if the goal is to have a battlefield where the only expected role for the human warfighter in theater is to sign the instruments of surrender?

Assume that every weapon the opposing force attempts to use is neutralized convincingly using autonomous swimming/flying/walking/driving robots. Tanks? Destroyed by disposable tank-killing kamikaze drones. Men with guns? Insect sized sensor robots report them and bird sized UAVs attack with serious but nonlethal force, anyone carrying a gun or operating a weapon ends up in a hospital. Warships and attack boats? Please meet the fleet of thousands of robot boats and subs. Fighters and bombers get immediately spotted and attacked by swarms of 24h patrolling robot planes. All this kit ends up being much cheaper than an Iraq or Afghanistan type war because friendly lives *aren't* at stake with the robots. No more exotic [$678m planes,](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/f-22-real-cost/) instead the US churns them out and let ""quantity have a quality of its own.""

How would this change how wars are fought? Would (say) the US be more gung-ho about tackling thorny geopolitical problems such as North Korea?

Edit: to make it more plausible/interesting, lets say the US justifies autonomous robot warfare by promising *and delivering* very few enemy deaths.

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

Someone influential in Congress proposes it, it is favored by the president, but is failed in the vote. People get fed up with Congress failing to do something and begin organizing groups for a repeal, who elect new members who support it in the next Congressional and state legislature elections. Still, it is not enough to pass and fails. Regardless the people who are in support of the proposed amendment successfully petition 38 (75% of the current 50 states) of the states' legislatures to force Congress to hold a constitutional convention to let the states pass it. Eventually, it reaches the 75% of the states legislatures required to approve it and Congress reluctantly ratifies the amendment. It would be the second time this has happened; the first was the [21st Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), which repealed Prohibition.

**I'm asking what this could imply - how this data could be used etc. What do you think ?** (&lt;- tl;dr)

----

**Further explanation**: computer games/virtual realities are getting enhanced day after day. Just look at the development of games in 10years and now think further (maybe 50years) and the rather exponentional rate of this development. We will have virtual realities that are close to actual reality without a doubt. Now what if people could monitor all your psychological reactions there ? There are many ways how this could be done but I'm more speaking of the game just coming with that inbuilt. It could forward every input from the user that it gets; and virtual realities get more and more input. By now for some inputs games have is where you look with the mouse etc.  
As written I actually thought about this when playing Far Cry 3 and there was a mission in which there was a guy (whose business you plan to infiltrate) explaining his global product (could be seen as Far Cry 3 the game) and that there is a camera in the characters' eyes (you the player, you then needed to slaughter your friend because he saw what you saw and you needed to trick him).

And as writing I thought about one implication: what if virtual realities become so used and so complex&amp;detailed [eventually even merging with reality ingame much like in [""Surrogates""](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UGwQ74cH5O0)] that people spend most of their time in them and the analysation of the data is done by AI. Eventually this AI even could initiate specific reactions/situations in the game and find ways to change your reactions, or find people that are more likely to be violent, etc...... and much more - that another huge ton of implications.

Caveats:
    
    1. No one would ever be able to have kids. If everybody suddenly became immortal but retained the ability to procreate, humanity would reach critical mass in about 3-4 days.
    
    2. You would be able to end your own life if you chose to.
    
    3. You would stay the same age you are now.
    
    4. The exception to 3 would be people under ~25, who would continue to develop normally until the age of their choosing. (the logic behind this being that the brain usually doesn't fully develop in terms of hormones, decision-making, etc. until someone's mid-20s.)
    
    5. You would lose any sort of potentially lethal disease or recurring painful condition - e.g. Parkinson's, shingles, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, HIV, AIDS, etc.
    
    6. You would still be able to feel pain from physical injury, but would not be able to die from any sort of trauma, e.g. if someone was in a natural disaster or terrorist attack or anything that would cause their body to be vaporized or crushed or burned, they would feel immense pain but the body would not degrade.

If boring technology were improved slightly, and this technology were placed on an oil rig like installation, in theory it might be possible to created a man-made underwater volcano. Obviously there would be other technical hurdles to overcome, such as insulating the magma as it rises through the borehole and water, and directing it as it as it exits above the water surface.

Question: Say Great Britain or Honshu (the islands of the UK/Japan with the vast majority of the population) were to have their populations suddenly reduced to percentage points of their present amount or completely wiped out (without affecting anything else) how would this affect:

•	Sovereignty

Would the smaller islands (by population) that also form the countries be able to retain their right to the govern that area / how would the international community react to the smaller government of these countries, would they be supportive?

•	Assets

what would happen to the countries vast assets? everything from vehicles to high end electronics would be easy to come by in these countries, would an industry form out of collecting and selling things of value like this? also, would international companies retain their rights over assets held within the country (stock, etc.)

•	Production capability

would things like oil refineries and any other examples of internationally important facilities come under temporary management (importing workers / resources) until other countries can build to fill the demand left by the loss of their production capabilities

•	Militarily

how would the assets of their respective military s be handled especially navies (and especially in regards to the UK) I'm assuming navies would be largely unaffected by the disaster as they are ships and therefore weren't infected, how would such a large military force for such a small number of people conduct itself, would ships be sold or would they defer to allied control to retain functionality?

•	please note: I know that a biological reason for wiping out the population would lead to quarantine / rotting bodies etc. so can we try to work around that in order to give us an essentially abandoned Island civilisation, maybe the government had already initiated quarantine procedures, started burning bodies / set up facilities outside of population centres or anything like that leading to a situation where biological hazards within the towns and cities are minimal for those coming after the event""

[Political World in 2057](http://i.imgur.com/5tVwk7L.jpg)


**2014** – Scottish Independence is defeat at the polls.


**2020's** – United Kingdom hold referendum about staying in the EU. Euro-sceptic Conservatives along with UKIP MP's manage to sway the vote against and UK leaves the EU.


**2030's** – British Government establish better trade within the Commonwealth of Nations.


**2045** – Argus Industries based in London unveil a new product. A small scale Thorium Nuclear Reactor. About the size of a semi-truck it can power whole cities. London suddenly becomes awash with money. They have clean, cheap power everyone wants.


**2045 to 2046** – Over the next 18 months oil prices plummet as hundreds of Thorium Reactors roll off the assembly lines into India, South Africa, Canada and Australia as the “Commonwealth Conservative” government with UKIP backing grant charters to their Commonwealth friends. The USA is left out in the cold. The US had had her problems over the years with wars in the middle east and other areas, but the fact that all oil was traded in US dollars let her expand like no other nation in history. What the British did though just about destroyed the USA. Within 18 months the price of oil had dropped to a shadow of its former self. That was when the problems began... for everyone. Massive lay off began in the oil sector and went through to the automotive, coal and other sectors of the economy like wildfire. 


**Oct 16 2046** – The US dollar drops 50% in one day causing the US to fall into a depression.


**2046 to 2047** – With the US in a depression the rest of the world economy begins to collapse. Riots, depressions, bush wars and chaos spreads worldwide as airlines, freight, railways and even cities begin to shut down. People can't get paid, pensions or savings. World trade grinds to a halt.


**2047** – China goes into a full revolution. Few news breaches the Silk Curtain as the Politburo try to suppress the revolution and show the world everything is fine. In reality dark and horrific rumours come out from behind the Silk Curtain. Things like human meat being cheaper than pork. Russia is facing the same problems as their economy was propped up on oil and gas exports. 


**2046 – 2050** Many other countries are suffering riots, food problems that last for years. Most of Africa goes dark. South America is awash in political and guerilla groups. Weapons become cheap as the Russia and US have fire sales in desperate attempts to shore up their economies. 


**2051** – The US enters a Second Civil War as the states west of the Rocky Mountains secede from the Federal Government and establish their own country of Pacifica. The southern “Confederate” states secede later in the year forming the Confederate States of America. Britain is sending some aid along with some other countries but it will be years before the US is whole again. Britain is offering citizenship to the rich, the tech gurus and like rats leaving a sinking ship the best and brightest are now fleeing to Britain.


**2052** – The Commonwealth of Nations holds a trade summit in Ottawa, Canada. They decide they are the only ones left with any muscle left to try and jump start a world economy. The US is in a three way fight to reclaim their lands. Russia is broke and China is trying to put down a rebellion. They decide to form a political and economical union after much debate and negotiations. The Commonwealth of Nations is born as a political/economical entity. Each member state will have control over domestic affairs and a Commonwealth Parliament will have control over defence, trade and foreign policy. Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, UK, Singapore form the core nations. They form a single currency union unsurprisingly called the Pound and remove trade barriers between countries of the Commonwealth. 


**2053 to 2057** – The Commonwealth of Nations hold originally seemed to be tenuous as there was political and cultural differences between the core nations. After a transition period it begins to settle and the Commonwealth Parliament decides to impose order on other member states of the Commonwealth who haven't officially signed up to the new Parliament. Bolstered by recruits from the Indian sub continent, Africa and Australia the Commonwealth Army begins to move into other southern African nations with the goal of stabilizing them and integrating them into the Commonwealth. It's navy is reminiscent of the old Royal Navy with the Commonwealth disregarding all restrictions on shipbuilding as it claims it hasn't negotiated these treaties. Most of the South American countries band together to protect their mutual interests from Westerners who would exploit them. China having sorted their internal problems begins to expand across South East   Asia trying to secure resources for themselves. Russia expands into middle Asia to try and stop Chinese power growing on their borders and to strengthen their armies, decimated in suppressing revolts, against the European Union. Lead by France and Germany the European Union weathered the “Dark Years” better than most other powers eventually became the political bloc it was long expected to become.


**2057 on wards** – The Great Game begins as the Commonwealth tries to combat Chinese expansion in South East Asia. Prevent the US from becoming united again and trying to sway African leaders away from other world powers such as the EU, Russian Federation, the Chinese and the South American Alliance.

I was recently talking with a friend, who mentioned watching a documentary (though he failed to mention the name, so if anyone knows it please reply!) about Time Travel. He pointed out one of the theories he found most interesting.

This form of time travel can only be used from the moment it is created to the moment it ends. Traveling into your past is *not* something you can do, unless your past falls between those two points. 

I found it amusing, because if that were to happen, the idea of time would suddenly take on a whole new meaning. If you were able to travel to any point in time--to be at any single time at any time in your life, what impacts would that have on an individual? What impacts would it have on society?

What about crime? If a murder happens, just go back to right before it happens, and stop the killer before he has time to commit the crime. The same goes for accidents. Things would change so drastically. 

I thought it would be interesting to discuss...so, what do you guys think?

Please, if you could, let a poor sinner know. Akatosh will reward your generosity.

""Greetings fellow architects, builders, scoundrels, and scallywags. I’ve long since joining this sub considered when the right time would be to submit my creation for the ogling eyes of the community to critique and consider, but have since come to the conclusion that well, fuck it all, the time is now you little bitch. So posthaste, I submit to you a world so hot off the iron presses, it could very well sear your fingertips right off.

I’ll preface her with a bit of background. Earth: 2043. The planet’s oil supply has essentially been run dry. The once great nations of man have been brought to their knees by a societal collapse, incomparable. Survivors exist solely on the merciful conditions of their surroundings, salvaging Old World remnants and toiling in basic industry, while fending off the ruthless nature of their new world. As in any state of crisis, there are those who take advantage of the misfortunes of collapsing regulation. Inhabiting the crumbling metropolic forests once home to the bustling traffic and towering corporations of a doomed society, the lawless are those very individuals who bask in the plight of their fellow man, seizing and claiming both property and life as they see fit. But that’s not the only threat to safety here in the naughty 40’s, Ace. It may be marginally difficult, but totally possible, to avoid death-by-looter. Something you can’t outrun, however, is a red-hot powerhouse of celestial rock screaming through the sky, with its crosshairs aimed at your oblivious existence. If you asked Larry Flannigan of the New Redford Township, he would agree. Although, in a wild galactic game of whack-a-mole, Larry was implanted into his moderately-profitable corn field several miles out of town, so he may be a little out-of-touch. 

Raining meteorites have become a highly common danger among the slew of threats around the globe. Having been dispatched from their motherly orbit in large quantity, they have attained a high standard of value in the currency of trade that replaced the previously broken system of dollars, yen, and the like. As ominous as the possibility of being squashed by a boulder may be, even more so is meeting eyes with its mother in the night’s sky, watching as it slides gently around the planet, both leading and following a trail of its children in parade. This was no act of God, though. No. This was a plague brought about by the greed and desperation of man. Seeking to extract a heaven-sent source of limitless power from within, a mining operation was begun and the behemoth engaged, coaxed into a near-orbit of Earth. As with any mission of this magnitude, however, there was a slim chance of failure - that the drilling could rupture the crusted shell coating its crystalline core. And it did.

This caused widespread panic and disorder, and sent the modern structure of human society rolling down a muddy hill, hitting every stone and thorny bush on its way toward the sloppy bottom. Some of those who survived the fall have held some vision of order together in forms of village refuges, townships, and community alliances. Others who prefer to live alone have taken to forests, bayous, hotels, and all sorts of other imaginative retreats to make living a bit more manageable. This sort of variation may just be the only way to outlive the bind long enough to have a chance at rebuilding what was once taken for granted. But this is life. This is the New Earth. ""

I'm trying to have a setting that's also post-WWIII where an attack on America was the catalyst for that and the eventual outcome being the United States left in a 3rd world state.

So I was just wondering if you could use your historical knowledge to consider how events would unfold if some group that opposed the US (whether it terrorist or other nation) managed to sneak bombs into the white house, congress building, and the supreme court building and essentially took out everyone inside. I would imagine it to basically leave the US government in a very bad way and would probably lead to the military stepping in to try and maintain the social peace in a state of marshal law for awhile.

So yeah. **What would happen if South Korea decides to like China more than America?** I'm not too well-versed in history, military, world affairs, etc. to imagine concretely what would happen.

Some things he predicted:
* The US will not be able to cast military presence in the Southeast Asia without a major ally in East Asia.
* Sinosphere will rise as a power bloc and make the East vs. West dichotomy explicit.
* The relationship between Japan and the US will strengthen.

Some things I imagine will happen:
* The relationship between North Korea and South Korea might shift to a less hostile tone, though I can't pick to what degree.
* South Korea will have to go through a social transformation, if it wishes to discard the anti-communist attitude it fostered for the last half a century. There probably will be political discord!

Summary:

&gt;To date, humanity has not made any form of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). But we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more ETI exist in our galaxy, or that we could detect, communicate with, or in other ways have contact with them in the future. There have been many analyses of how contact would proceed, but these tend to focus narrowly on one possible contact scenario. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the broad range of possible ETI contact scenarios in terms of whether the contact would benefit or harm humanity. Such scenario analysis helps train our minds to recognize patterns in actual outcomes, which can be valuable in the event of an encounter.

Mutually Assured Destruction: No one side can launch a nuclear strike without a counterattack from their opponent. Now lets say a weapon is invented that completely upsets the balance: ie, a weapon that nuetrializes a counterattack.

Scenario:

2022: Tensions escalate between Japan, South Korea and China. The Chinese military becomes more beligerent.

June 22, 2023: DARPA launches a new black project missile defense program.

September 30, 2030: Scientists sucsessfully demonstrate a revolutionary new missile defense system at Groom Lake. Using batteries of laser cannons, particle beam weaponry and railguns, they sucsessfully intercept five ICBMs launched from Kwajelin Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The test system is named SHILD, or Super High Intercontinental Laser Defense.

2031: Further tests of SHILD continue. A SHILD rapid-fire laser cannon mounted on a nuclear submarine sucsessfully intercepts another ICBM fired from Kwaj, this time during the boost phase. SHILD is readied for full deployment, but remains a black project. The Chinese military becomes very suspicious of the missile tests, but cannot discover the sources of the intercepts. Rumors fly around the world of a new American superweapon. The US government denies all existence of the program, although evidence starts to mount of SHILD's existence.

June 16, 2033: SHILD becomes fully operational, with hidden batteries installed along the West Coast, Alaska, Hawaii, and American bases abroad.

July 22, 2033, 1100 zulu: Japan and China, finally reaching their breaking point, go to war over the Senkaku/Dioyu Islands, kicking off a major war. The situation quickly escalates. USAF satellite recon indicates that the Chinese nuclear force is mobilizing, and intercepted transmissions indicate that they are preparing to attack Japan, South Korea, the Phillipines, and Australia with nuclear missiles. The President conveys an emergency meeting with his senior advisers and military leaders. The Chairman of the Joint Cheifs of Staff informs them that the SHILD system has a very high probability of intercepting a Chinese missile attack, and American casualties would be minimal. The reality sets in: The US would be able to attack China with a full blown nuclear strike without fear of retaliation.

July 22, 2033, 1350 zulu: The President and his advisers retreat to  a secured bunker in the Cheyenne mountain complex. The SHILD system is energized, and the American nuclear force is out on DEFCON 1.

They do not want the US to replace Assad with a puppet, and they want to challenge US hegemony, which is becoming increasingly unilateral. The US recognizes this threat, and a number of people, such as Hilary Clinton have been talking about war with Iran. The US considers the dollar's role as international reserve currency, to be under threat, and it is. Also Iran has strategic control over the straights of Hormuz, where much of the world oil goes through. This is important because the dollar is no longer backed by gold, but rather, petrodollars - control over oil. If other nations start trading oil and other commodities in another currency such as Euros, or Rubles, US hegemony would be under threat. Also the rise of China is generally considered to be a threat, especially considering the weakness of the US economy.

The international reserve currency - the dollar, is becoming increasingly costly for other nations, the US prints money extensively, while effectively exporting the inflation to other countries who hold dollar reserves in their central banks. Many nations, will in unison, especially Iran, Russia and China, abandon the dollar.

Fabricated or not, there will be an incident, which will give the US excuse (or 'casus belli') to go to war with Iran. It might be in Syria, or in the straights of Hormuz. China and Russia, along with a number of weaker Asian nations (maybe India?), will the join the war on Iran and Syria's side.
