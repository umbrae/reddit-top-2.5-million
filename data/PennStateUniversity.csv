Well I decided to do the same thing, but for THON!  So for every upvote I receive, I will donate $0.20 to THON.  If I reach 50 upvotes, I will double my total!  Let the upvotes begin!

EDIT:  WOW!!  I was not expecting this type of response so fast!  With only 1,400 subscribers, I didn't think over 100 of them would already be upvoting this!  So proud to be a Penn Stater!  Let's keep this going and hopefully more people will start doing this!

EDIT #2:  Okay, so when this post reaches midnight I will see the # of upvotes (not rating) and calculate from there.  I already got one redditor on here to hopefully match my total and another friend that will also match it.  Right now, between the three of us it will be over $190!  Let's keep it up everybody!

FINAL EDIT:  The highest total of upvotes I saw by midnight was....... 175!!!  Which means $35.  But since it got over 50 upvotes, I will double that to a total of $70!!  Now because of how well this went, plus I am a stickler for clean numbers, let's throw in a $5 bonus, totaling to $75!  I will be doing this again next year when I have a job for even more money.  Thank you so much everybody for helping out!

So basically that's the story. I've apparently lost my mind, and am moving from Florida (where I've lived my entire life) with the girlfriend of a year up to Bellefonte. We've found a nice little place that we're about to put a deposit down on tomorrow (!).

I'm currently 25 and employed as the web developer &amp; photographer at a local four-year college. I'm job hunting with the goal of making a living wage doing something besides flipping burgers.

What I need from _you_ guys is a sense of exactly how insane this is (snow? what's snow? like cold sand from the sky?), and what life in the Penn State world is like if you're _not_ a student.

Managing Editor Kevin Horne just posted this article, ([""Stephon Morris Goes HAM on Twitter""](http://onwardstate.com/2013/01/21/stephon-morris-goes-ham-on-twitter/)) rife with additional commentary by Kevin himself that is critical of former and current Penn State students (Royer still attends Penn State). 

Seriously, was this necessary? Was it even worthy of a post? If some current and former players want to start airing some petty grievances, let them. But, is this something OS really needed to jump in on?

Hypocritically, this is just two months after they posted this article:

[""Silas Redd does not deserve the vitriol.""](http://onwardstate.com/2012/11/30/113117/)

**EDIT 1** - Re-posting my comment from below here:

I really wish Kevin would just resign from the blog, or at least as an editor.

Kevin and Devon wrecked the entire tone of that blog (along with a few writers). They are a couple of egotistical, antagonistic, unfunny smartasses. I would like to see Dave Cole take full control and take it in a new (better) direction.

**EDIT 2** - I just want to say that Devon reached out to me privately, and we've engaged in a friendly dialogue about some of the things said here and in the past.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,1358845660.0,,,True,t3_1717od,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/1717od/onward_states_decline_into_a_cheap_gossip_blog/,

I'm just saying to be nice to them because when my friends and I went to Ohio State last year all of their fans were really nice to all of us despite the fact that 'Pedo State' was an easy insult to throw around at that time. We've always been known for returning the favor in terms of fan hospitality and Ohio State was nothing but classy to my group last year. That included while we were tailgating before the game, during the game, and after the game when they had every ~~right~~ excuse to be pissed off since we won (I don't think I need to remind anyone about that though).

I will be an assistant coach at a high school and it is mandatory to attend a course like this.

The class is focused on two 30 minute long videos from both the victims and the perpetrators interviews.  It is very twisted and messed up but there were many things I would like to comment on regarding that relate to how Paterno handled the situation.

During the class the instructor, who used to be a lawyer and has worked in this field for 7 years, made a few things VERY clear.

1) Never investigate any accusations yourself... EVER

2) Report the accusation (even if you are not sure of the validity of it) to your superiors or the superior for the accused individual.

3) If comfortable approach the individual, however this isn't recommended.

After you go through those steps you have done what they ""require""/ ""want"" for these situations.  The force placed on the ""do not investigate yourself"" couldn't have been more clear.

Now to how this relates to Paterno.  He did exactly what they said once he learned about a potential incident in 2001 AND followed up on the situation for a second time after he felt nothing had occurred.  While I am not saying he did or did not actually know (I find it hard to believe from this incident that he had any evidence that could make him sure something was happening) what happened, he did exactly what they wanted.

It is sad when a course that is 100% focused on properly handling the abuse identifies their desired plan/actions, which were followed, and you still watch Paterno get burned by the media.  It will not surprise me if in the future Paterno is proven innocent, however the media will not take back their accusations sadly.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_1195n8,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/1195n8/child_abuse_and_paterno/,

The next day, Coach Paterno called and left [**this**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz1YYKTpWj0) voicemail for my girlfriend's dad.

I've been a student of Penn State now for nearly 8 years and I've seen State Patty's day from the beginning to what it is today. I have to say this holiday needs to be eradicated. This holiday isn't fun anymore and it hasn't been for years.

It's been proven (according to police crime statistics)
UP Students are not the issue here,
Fraternities are not the issue here,
State College Bars are not the issue here

But yet every year we all get 40 emails from the university saying not to participate in State Patty's day, the IFC bans parties on this day, bars all across State College close for the day because the risk is far greater then any monetary gain. So, why do we as a student body and a community allow a bunch of fucking assholes from out of town to come in here and ruin this for us? It's silly and truly shows that we as a student body love self destruction. 

This holiday isn't even ran by it's original creator who won't touch this shit with a 30 foot pole, so what does that say about the creators original intentions of this? It certainly in the beginning wasn't a giant black-out holiday, it was a holiday meant to replace St. Patty's day because it fell on Spring break. Then the holiday over the years has become infused with pure stupidity into what we have now. 

We as a student body need to do something about this holiday because the community does something about us. This holiday only strengthens the borough's and university's ability to set down new enforceable rules on us and our social lives as students here. Why should you care? Because for now these sanctions are isolated to the time State Patty's day occurs, but what is stopping university and borough officials from sweep legislation citing State Pattys day ""excessive binge drinking"" as a source. All because some creepy assholes from out of town come and get blacked out and commit crimes in our town.

For reference the crime on this day is usually worse than a home football game and had significantly more alcohol related incidents. (Big Surprise) Also, the State Police descend upon the town for the holiday so the number of police is an all time high as well during the weekend of the Holiday.

I try not to judge people on matters that I, personally, don't know enough of. So I will say that I hope justice is served appropriately. (Whatever the fuck that entails.)

I've visited Penn State on multiple occasions (My gf is a junior at PSU), and I have yet to meet an individual there that I did not like. Collectively speaking, you are a fantastic group of people. 

I'd also like to personally apologize for the stupid fucking shirts and chants that members of our student body showed off during our game in September. I'd like to say that I was not a part of the problem, but I lose it at game time when it comes to class. (Just for the record, I did not wear a ""We are ... Fuck you,"" shirt. I thought that was absolutely stupid. I did however make some obscene gestures towards the opposite side of the stadium.) This is precisely why I opted out of tonight's TU game.

""As a graduate of The Ohio State University, I never thought that I would be writing about anything that related to Penn State. But, I can no longer take the ignorance and lynch mob mentality of many of the media outlets, as well as the general populace.
 
It has always amazed me that we (readers and listeners of mass media) have become so lazy that we swallow every morsel of so called news as gospel. Lest we forget that the media must sell their wares in order to remain in business. With the advent of ever evolving technology that task has become increasing more difficult. As a result, the media too have evolved.
 
What used to be a respected profession, where journalistic integrity and the reporting of the facts were not only the norm, but were sacred and guarded, has now become a mission to remain relevant and profitable. Their integrity and reporting of the facts have often taken a back seat to the sensationalizing of some facet of the news.
 
It’s no longer good enough to simply report the facts and allow the readers or listeners to form their own judgment or opinion. Many articles today are merely watered down editorials with morsels of the truth thrown in so one could call it a news article.
 
I believe that the media are the most powerful people in the world. We have been led to believe, in fact brain washed in a sense, to accept the words of the media as an unbiased and fair representation of the facts.
 
The Sandusky Sex Scandal, or as it’s better know the Penn State Sex Scandal… because the word “Sandusky” won’t sell as many papers or TV ads as “Penn State”, is a prime example of the media gone wrong.
 
I continue to be amazed by the irrational comments from generally intelligent people. Their naive acceptance of the media’s portrayal of the students/athletes, as well as Joe Paterno and other officials at Penn State is very bothersome to me and it should be to you.
 
For those of us who have actually read Louis Freeh’s report (which is the most comprehensive study about the Sandusky Sex Scandal) with an open mind, it must make you wonder about a number of things.
 
One of the most basic tenets of the entire document has been largely ignored by media. The report clearly states that in 1998 an investigation took place regarding Sandusky and alleged misconduct with young boys. The District Attorney along with the police department and several state organizations conducted numerous interviews. School officials, parents and alleged victims were all questioned. The investigation was closed and no charges were filed.
 Sandusky should have been stopped in 1998. He wasn’t.
 
The report went on to say that law enforcement and child welfare officials were ill equipped and not sufficiently trained to adequately recognize and handle adolescent sexual abuse. What? Why isn’t that the headline? Apparently, that won’t sell as many ads or newspapers.
 
That one sentence shines a whole new light on this entire tragedy. If the professionals who are hired to serve and protect didn’t have the proper knowledge, training and education as it pertained to adolescent abuse, what makes everyone think that a football coach or academic officials should?
 
However, not one media outlet picked up on that and reported the finding. Apparently, it wasn’t sensational enough.
 In 2001, having been through a Sandusky investigation just three years prior, Joe Paterno reported yet another incident to school officials. Knowing the result of the 1998 investigation, one might understand (not condone, but understand) why, after the initial report was filed, there was limited follow up on the part of Joe Paterno.
 
There’s no doubt that Paterno and school officials made some horrendous decisions. But, so did the law enforcement personnel and state agencies who were supposed to be knowledgeable about pedophiles and their characteristics.
 
I question why the media and many of you are holding a football coach and an administration to a higher standard than law enforcement and agencies whose job it is to protect all of us? Would you hold Child Protective Services, State Police or the District Attorney responsible if the Nittany Lions lost a football game? Of course not. It’s irrational and idiotic. I’m not downplaying the acts of Sandusky. They were horrific!
 
Further, I’m not defending anyone, but simply pointing out the fact that the mob is trying to condemn Penn State’s current students, athletes and officials for grievous acts committed 12 or 14 years ago. For the most part, today’s student body at Penn State were just getting out of diapers when these acts occurred. How is it rational or just for them to be punished?
 
One final thought. During the same time frame of 12 to 14 years, the students at Penn State have raised and donated nearly $100 million dollars for research and a cure for pediatric cancer. Thousands of young lives have been saved or made better because of the students at Penn State. Let’s stop casting aspersions and not forget all of the good they have done.
 
So, before you jump on the band wagon, perhaps you should know the facts and not just what the media want you to believe.
 
I’m proud to be a Buckeye, but feel very sad for the victims, students and everyone who calls Happy Valley home.""",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_x4zzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/x4zzb/o_the_powers_of_mass_media/,

1330718810.0,35,self.PennStateUniversity,qew6d,Girlfriend was turned down for a job because she went to Penn State.,46,11,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/qew6d/girlfriend_was_turned_down_for_a_job_because_she/,"My girlfriend and I are both Penn State grads living in Los Angeles. She currently works for a studio, but is also applying for roles student and indie films, commercials etc. Last night she receives a response from one of the indie films, which is exciting because that means they at least liked her headshot to continue reading her resume. It turns out to be a rejection, which isn’t a big deal because that’s part of the job hunting experience. The response though was very short, and greatly surprised us. 

It said, “Penn State is not a school I respect.” 

That’s it. Now the only reason they sent this reply is to spite her. If they did not like her or want her, they would have merely skipped past her and not even bothered sending her a ‘Thanks, but no thanks,’ email.  My girlfriend responded professionally, offering some video evidence of Penn State’s good deeds (THON, JoePa’s donations, etc.), said she was proud of her school, thanked them for their consideration, and wished them luck in their film and future projects. She receives a response a few hours later with the following (copy and pasted verbatim):

“Proud of a school that covered up pedophilia to protect a cash-generating football program? 
Sorry for how I feel? not sorry for what PSU did....says it all.
 
I'm sure you wouldn't want to work for someone who doesn't liek PSU anyway. “

Now we were both boiling with anger and decided not to respond right away in fear of acting unprofessional and sending a negative image. We will take some time later tonight and craft a response, but after the rage subsides, I’m left so saddened that this stigmatism exists. 

A friend suggested legal action, but I seriously doubt it’s worth the time considering it’s for an indie film and the entertainment industry can be incredibly slimy when it comes to hiring practices anyway.

Just thought I’d offer this up as an example to be prepared for a harsh reality when facing the job market. 


Keep Calm and Fight On.

On Saturday, I will be rooting for Penn State.

I will be rooting for Matt McGloin, a former walk-on QB from West Scranton who scratched and clawed his way to the top of the depth chart.

I will be rooting for Silas Redd, one of the hardest working players in the nation.

I will be rooting for Stephon Green, a kid who proves there is always a second chance.

I will be rooting for Joe Suhey, a so-called wasted legacy scholarship who has become a fine player.

I will be rooting for Quinn Barham, Johnnie Troutman, Deontae Pannell, and Chima Okoli, four seniors playing their last home game on the OLine.

I will be rooting for Andrew Sczerba, a player who has overcome a ridiculous amount of adversity in the past year just to be on the field one last time.

I will be rooting for Derek Moye, who risked further injury to play in one miraculous drive for 409.

I will be rooting for Devon Smith, so every undersized football player can see there is a chance for them too.

I will be rooting for Jack Crawford and Eric Latimore, because no matter how many times they got knocked down they kept on fighting.

I will be rooting for Devon Still, because dominance deserves respect.

I will be rooting for Nate Stupar, who showed everyone what the phrase next man up really means.

I will be rooting for Gerald Hodges, because we are Linebacker U.

I will be rooting for D'Anton Lynn, because he saw for a moment how quickly it could all be taken away, but he got back up.

I will be rooting for Chaz Powell, because he has worked hard for 5 years whether on offense, defense, or special teams.

I will be rooting for Drew Astorino and Nick Sukay, because even if the fans don't always love them, they still play hard, leave it all on the field, and represent our university.

I will be rooting for Adrian Amos, because I still have hope for the future.

I will be rooting for Anthony Fera, because sometimes you just have to step up and do it all.

Most importantly, I will be rooting for Penn State. Bad things have happened, and hopefully once all the facts are clear those who are responsible are given whatever punishment they deserve, but we are still a great university with a great tradition. And most importantly, these kids who will run out of the tunnel have nothing to do with this awful situation. Be upset with Jerry Sandusky, be upset with Tim Curley. If you must, be upset with Graham Spanier or Mike McQueary or even Joe Paterno. But don't turn your back on these 18-23 year old young men who just want to go out and win a game.""

Despite Beaver Stadium being packed once again--united--we couldn't establish a solid foothold into our program's new era.

However, there was one moment which was genuinely heartfelt and magnificent--some may even say, *healing*.

It occurred during the singing of our Alma Mater. Like many other universities, we rose from our seats, link arms, and sang our song before this football. But this time it was special. For those of you who don't know (hopefully none of you) these are the lyrics to ""Raise the Song"":

""

For the glory of old State,

For her founders strong and great,

For the future that we wait,

Raise the song, raise the song.

/

Sing our love and loyalty,


Sing our hopes that bright and free


Rest, O mother dear, with thee,


All with thee, all with thee.

/

When we stood at childhood's gate,

Shapeless in the hands of fate,

Thou didst mold us, dear old State,

Dear old State, dear old State.

/

**May no act of ours bring shame,**

To one heart that loves thy name.

May our lives but swell thy fame,

Dear old State, dear old State.

""

Not that 90,000 of us chanting our Alma Mater is quiet by any stretch of the imagination, but during the singing of the emboldened line ""May no act of ours bring shame,"" we truly gave it our all. Here we were, at the moment the 3rd largest city in PA, gathered in unison, not singing, but proudly declaring (yelling, really) our misstep and our now-prerogative. 

It was bellowing.

It was magnificent.

And once the game was over, and our players were walking off the field solemn and heartbroken, we gathered and sang it again. 

I share this with you because the description ""proud"" simply doesn't suffice. It was a defining moment of our university, and hardly any non-Penn Staters experienced it. It was a reminder that we are more than what happened to us this past year. We are a gigantic but great crowd of individuals who really contribute something to this world.

I enjoyed Penn State Football, I didn't worship it. I don't care what happens to a damn statue. I am unhappy with my school. It was very hard hearing this all unfold, even while attending a branch campus. Child abuse is a horrible thing, and I feel incredibly sorry for the young guys involved - I hope all their wishes and dreams come true in life because I wish this for everyone.

I think this was a good wake up call for the Penn State community. It was obvious that PSU Football was held in too high of a regard, especially if it created a cover-up in a child abuse situation. But I also hope that Penn State can continue to recover. I am unhappy with Penn State, but I have a lot of pride. Pride for the quality of professors, pride for my intense and rewarding education, and pride knowing that the actions of a few men do not make me a terrible person, just because I chose to go to Penn State when everyone thought of it as a great school.

I don't want to assume anything about anyone, but I feel that at least a few of you, like myself, find the idea of gathering to meet complete strangers with a common interest (i.e. Reddit) to be intriguing, yet horrifying.  (Social anxiety FOR THE WIN.)

I graduated from Penn State on Saturday with a B.A. in Secondary Education - Social Studies.

On Sunday morning, once all of my family and friends had left, my boyfriend of four years, whom I live with, broke up with me.

Because of financial reasons, I have to keep living with my boyfriend until July when our lease is up.  Blah, blah, blah.  Basically, I've been crying non-stop and things are looking bleak.  My best friend lives about three hours away, and she's at work, so she can't talk for a large portion of the day.

I've already checked out /r/SuicideWatch and called a few hotlines, so I'm not looking to discuss the actual break-up (I mostly don't want to put that on anyone).  I seriously just want to potentially hang out with anyone to get my mind off of all of this.  Drinks, coffee, whatever.

We can discuss anything, seriously.  Sports, video games, television, movies.  I have wide-ranging interests.

Oh, wow.  This is starting to sound ridiculous and desperate.

**TL;DR - Socially awkward girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.  Honestly just want to meet up and talk about anything other than my imploding relationship.  Comment here or PM me, I guess.**

**EDIT:** I met up with [source_code](http://www.reddit.com/user/source_code) at the Starbucks on North Atherton.  It felt seriously good to just meet up with someone and talk about TV, movies, books, etc.  Also, he managed to get me to talk *a little* about the breakup, which was kind of good, I guess.  It's nice to say out loud why my boyfriend (claimed to have) dumped me, and to have someone basically respond, ""That's bullshit.  Don't second guess yourself.  *He's* the asshole.""

Also, we managed to sit next to two Penn State Redditors unintentionally who... were on a blind date or something?  I don't know.  That was interesting.  She, however, is in the exact same situation as I am (broke up with her boyfriend, has lived with him for the past two months, and things aren't going well at all), so it was weirdly coincidental to run into someone who could give me a very specific and personal perspective on the entire thing.

You're witnessing those who once celebrated their achievements at this University literally setting fire to their diplomas in front of our most historic buildings. 

You're witnessing our idols and role models we've always known being turned into public enemies overnight. 

You're witnessing a once peaceful, isolated, and proud community - the most beloved place on earth for hundreds of thousands - being invaded by national news outlets, turned inside out, and depicted as a safe haven for some of the most deplorable human acts. 

We've always welcomed guests to our community with open arms, and we certainly wish this upon nobody again in history as we don't even know yet the full extent of these consequences on our lives. We've never seen anything like this before, and it is extremely difficult for us to comprehend. 

If you consider all of this and still choose to celebrate, so be it, but you're stomping on the thousands of already shattered hearts as the result of a small handful of individuals' actions.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_m61rq,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/m61rq/for_those_celebrating_what_is_happening_to_penn/,

People were being ignorant, making fun of students that and alumni that were saying how JoePa was such an influence on their lives.  My answer is pretty long and it may not be perfect since I wrote it at 3 am but I feel it fits how we all feel about the man. 

Q: Well, in what ways did Joe Paterno affect you? Would he have affected you in the same way if he was the football coach at Pepperdine - or the water polo coach at Penn State (I guess that one is a loaded question)?

A: This is a totally fair question. I do need to give a little background to explain though. Before Joe became a coach at Penn State in 1950, the football program was nothing special. Good, not great. The school was a decent sized university. Big, not enormous in relative to other schools. In 1966, he became the head coach of the university. What he did in the following 45 years was monumental. He never let money become the thing that decided his future. He got multiple offers in the 60s and 70s to other programs or NFL teams for much more than what he was paid at the time. Heck, the Patriots offered him in the 70s roughly what he was paid in 2010. He always put morals first also (go ahead, insert Sandusky comments). He made sure his players actually got college educations. Each year, Penn State's football program had one of the higher graduation rates in the country. I know of multiple occurrences where he wouldn't let players play a game, or even a season (and on some occasions, two seasons!) due to their lack of academic successes. The program never had a single major NCAA violation while he was the head coach. The only other two BCS schools that can say that are Stanford and Northwestern. He also never put himself on a pedestal. If you read stories from people that went to school at Penn State or lived in the area, they are all similar. One of my favorites was how he went to a restaurant and asked how long the wait was. The hostess (a girl that was about 17 and didn't know anything about football) said about an hour. Joe said 'Thank you but I don't want to wait that long. Have a nice day.' He turned around and left. Anybody else in his shoes would have played the celebrity card. The man lived in the same small ranch house for nearly 40 years. He loved his wife more than anybody could imagine. He donated millions to the school and to the Penn State Dance Marathon (a student run organization that raises money to fight pediatric cancer). Half the library is named after his (the Pattee-Paterno Library) because he once donated FOUR million dollars to the school to expand the library. Trust me, the library was not impressive at all before that donation. Today, it is enormous and very up-to-date. I could keep going on but I will leave the stories there.

What I am trying to say is, while we did learn recently that he is human, just like anybody else, he still is a legend in the eyes of Penn Staters. This isn't just because of his football feats. It is about the person that he was. He was a genuine man that never said or thought he was perfect. He admitted to mistakes (as he did in his interview last week). He always put education before his own program. He fought and stood for what he believed in. He was the type of man I would love to be. He has ideals and standards, however, that I would never be able to live up to. I loved Joe Paterno. I still do. I am not one of those people that felt that he was perfect or that he was like a dad to me. Grandfather maybe (ba dum dum). I loved him as a person (and as a coach of course). If he was at Pepperdine instead of Penn State, who is to say that he wouldn't have done the same there. And of course the fact that he was a football coach instead of water polo made a difference. But he didn't let that affect who he was.

Honestly, it is unfair that when this man died, there are still plenty of people that are defecating on his grave that he hasn't even been buried in yet. When Michael Jackson died, a man that on multiple occasions was accused of actually sexual assaulting children, he was remembered for the great things. He was basically turned into a saint by the public. Joe Paterno makes one mistake. A large mistake albeit (but not as large as what the media is making it out to be because he didn't commit the nor did he completely ignore it. He should have done more but he did do something. He did what he was supposed to do but his higher ups refused to follow up on it because they are the horrible people. Anyways...) but still just one mistake. Steve Jobs was idolized after death despite being a total asshole that stole ideas from other innovators and loved to hog the limelight. Joe Paterno hated the limelight and was always nice to whoever he met. I could go on. To end this really, really, really, long post. We all have flaws. Nobody is perfect. Being able to accept your flaws and the flaws of others is what makes you a good human being. Not dehumanizing people because they have flaws, especially after their death. He didn't commit the sexual behavior toward the children. He didn't kill people. He didn't do anything illegal. He made a mistake and if he had the chance, he knows he would have done something different.

TL;DR: Joe Paterno was a human being. But the affect he had on thousands should help people remember him for the good, not the bad.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_owb90,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/owb90/i_was_asked_this_question_on_adviceanimals_when/,

We collected pledges and donations for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, an organization that works for AIDS/HIV prevention, care, and advocacy, for every hour the WBC was there.  In the end, we raised a few hundred dollars and left the WBC near speechless when they left at the end of the day.

I thought it would be really cool to do something like this when they come to protest JoePa's funeral.  We could either support GMHC, or donate to THON/Special Olympics PA, as the Paternos requested.  

It's a solution that allows people to express their anger/frustration with these animals, but without all the yelling/screaming/lawsuits that usually come with interacting with them.

I have been a die hard PSU fan since I was seven, but after all of this, football does not seem important to me at all anymore.

Here is where I have the problem:  the financial impact of not having a football season would be devastating to Central Pennsylvania.  I'm from the area and finding a job has been a major trial for the last five years, there are many small businesses run in Centre County that would be forced to cut back their staff if they didn't receive the revenue they do on Football weekends.

Furthermore, many of the surrounding counties have residents who commute to State College for work, Centre has a 5.3% unemployment rate (lowest in the state), the surrounding counties aren't nearly in as good of shape as Centre.

I know a lot of people will bash this outlook, saying just do something else, but the truth is that outside of this area the opportunities are few and far between.

Another idea we can do is we can do an official Reddit ""bar tour"" and we can bar hop around down town.

Lastly, we can do the awkward Reddit meet up in a restaurant and stare at our phones.

Any help much appreciated :)

* What do you like most about Penn State? What do you like least?

* (Penn state admits almost fifty kids from my high school every year so this is a crucial question) How often do you run into people you know/ from your high school?

* I'm a member of the marching band and the crew team for my school, what are these programs like at Penn State?

* How often do you eat at the creamery?

* What are the dorms like? The computers and facilities?

* How much of the freshmen fifteen is due to the creamery?

* Is Penn State go greek or go home? What's the deal with sororities and frats? What about sorority housing?

* Favorite clubs or things to do in such a big campus?

* I'll probably be going to summer session. Good choice or bad?

* What are my chances of getting a job on campus?

* What's your major? Do you like it? What are your favorite classes? Best professors in your opinion?

* What's PSU's biggest asset that I should take advantage of next year?

I am fortunate to live near my folks, and we spend our Saturdays cooking out, and watching the Lions play football. That is the way it has always been, and will continue to be. I was raised a Lions fan, the family dogs always had PSU collars, and I pretty much grew up in white and blue. Getting older, I have met many Lions and they have all been class acts. Some of the best science in the nation comes from that University, especially astronomy (which I adore.) The whole idea of Penn State in my mind was one of moral fortitude and what is right about the universe. With constant NCAA violations from schools like Miami and OSU, I thumbed my nose at football records and ribbed the fans of other schools. Who cares if PSU doesn't quite hang with national champ contenders every year. JoePa won games, and his kids were articulate intelligent men who GRADUATED. I like college football, it is much more exciting than pro ball, and it is about the kids becoming men and having fun. So this fallout could not have been more disappointing to me and my family. Those Saturdays will always have an asterisk in my mind. Those Saturdays are the days that I spend with my family, my mom and I will always have that bond. But that is nothing compared to the pain that the victims must endure. I am not a father, but I don't have to be to see how deplorable and disgusting these charges are. I'd like to do some pretty terrible things to Sandusky. I won't comment on who knew what and for how long, because I think that we won't really know the truth until the investigation is closed. I will say that I suspect Joe did not understand completely what was going on. Something tells me much of the football operations have been in the hands of other people for a long time. Even so, I think the board needs to clean house. That starts with Joe, love it or hate it. He is the icon that had to fall. I feel like I know the guy, and taking a bullet for his school is not beyond him. It seems like this is a case of a predator taking advantage of a edenal legacy.

What I saw was that a kid was speeding and he didn't stop before a stop sign.  He was coming from the library toward the college ave.  In front of the IST Bldg, he passed a sky-blue SUV which stopped at the stop sign in front of the IST Bldg at that particular moment. Then, the driver reacted furiously, and he yelled and cursed to tell the kid to get down, while he flipped his badge out. Probably a FBI badge or some sort of badge that represented authority. The kid had no idea what was going on, he cursed back ""WTF did I do"" or something that nature. 

EDIT: what I concluded was that you should probably follow traffic rules while you were riding a bike on campus. I know a lot of you don't, which including me, at times. -__-

Hopefully we can get more people to come since there isn't a home game this weekend! 

Everyone is welcome to bring any board games or card games they think people would want to play. Right now we have a couple different Munchkin card games, the game of things, settlers of catan, and someone's bringing their magic cards (so if you have them and want to play, bring them!). There was also some talk about apples to apples and cards against humanity, but I'm not entirely sure if someone is going to bring it. So if anyone has them and wants to bring them that would be great!

Snacks are welcome, but not necessary. Last time we ended up meeting for a while and then went to get Chipotle, so that's an option for food if anyone gets hungry.

I am an out-of-state resident who got accepted into Penn State's University Park campus. I'm pretty ecstatic, as I've heard good things about it.

1) I'm planning on majoring in Psychology, so if anyone else does the same, is it worth it? Penn State out of state can be quite expensive, so I was wondering if the education if worth the money.

2) How is the campus life? I am a party-goer, but not too much of one. Is the campus life big? What things are there to do outside of campus? Attractions, restaurants, bars, anything really. 

3) What is your overall opinion towards PSU? Do you feel you made the right decision in going here? Or do you think you should have thought twice about it?

EDIT: I forgot to ask this, and I regret it so much! But I'm a dancer, and I love dancing. If anyone is a dancer and reads this thread, how's the dancing scene over at PSU? Are there some organizations or clubs that pertain to dancing? Preferably hip-hop. Please let me know!

This was my response.",27,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/x32ca/my_friend_emailed_me_asking_my_thoughts_on_joepa/,"To understand the whole Paterno issue, you have to really understand what he meant to this university. Put simply, he was a god. He was the winningest coach in all of college football (up until yesterday morning when his wins were revoked), and football is the religion of America--which makes it even more so the religion of universities. Every Saturday we would wake up knowing that the Nittany Lions are as good as they were because of him.

But he was so much more than just a coach. He was a very ethical person who always put academics first--last year, PSU's football team ranked number one in academics nationally (D1). In fact, he cared about academics so much that he built Penn State a library. He donated something like 5 million to build the library, and kicked off a fundraising campaign that raised the rest of the money required. I still remember watching the video of the night he was fired--100s of students gathered outside of his house, and he came out and said thank you to all of them for being there, but to go home and study--they had classes in the morning. Academics really were so very important to him.

And not just academics, either. He really did his best to make an impact on students. He once was offered a job with the Patriots for ~12x his current salary, and he turned it down so he could influence more young people. He had an open door policy, so that anyone could walk in at any time and just talk with him--not just football players. He never pandered to the press--when asked what his strategy was for winning, he would respond 'Score more points than them.' Which quarter back are you going to start? 'The one I choose to.' He was an honest man who never sought fame.

Joe Paterno also made appearances at other events, such as Penn State's THON. THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy, and last year we raised $10 million for kids with pediatric cancer.

Joe Paterno was so great that once, I ran into him on the sidewalk and waved to him, and I made sure I told all my friends about it that night. We would joke that we would write a book about his life, with all his words in red. Joe Paterno brought our town together, focused on the right priorities and 

So, when the news of the scandal broke, and Paterno was fired by phone, all the students got really angry really fast. At that point no one had even thought he had done anything wrong--the news was fresh, reasons for firing weren't stated, it was done very disrespectfully and the grand jury testimony didn't really implicate him. (He later admitted he wished he would have done more--that he would have followed up on the case or reported it directly to the police--but at that point in time, there was nothing bad he did, he just didn't step up and take extra steps to make sure nothing bad continued to happen. He also was the only implicated person who apologized and admitted any guilt and any fault.) That's why everyone rioted--we all knew how good of a man he was, and being treated like THIS after 60 years of service to the unversity--that was simply unacceptable.

Then Paterno died. The whole campus was in morning. We lined the streets for the funeral procession--miles and miles of streets. We showed up at the Paterno statue with candles, and attended the viewing--this man who had made our university so great had died with a broken heart. It was such a shame.

Fast forward to this month, and the Freeh Report is released. You have to understand, this is after 9 months of having all of our friends and extended families hound us for 'why the hell do you go to Penn State? How can you possibly hold Paterno in any regard?' They never understood that we saw through his lack of action to the good he had done. They never understood the facts of the case so far--that Paterno didn't try to actively cover up anything. They didn't get that, after 9 months of having our world rocked and of having everyone hound us, we were so very tired.

The Freeh Report revealed some unfortunate truths about Joe Paterno. We know that he never acted with bad intentions--that he never tried to cover up any abuse in the name of football--but we had no idea that he had personally impeded the investigation. On February 24, 2001, the administrators had decided to report Sandusky to Child Welfare Services. On February 25, JoePa talked with one of the administrators, and on February 26, that administrator stated he had changed his mind and talked everyone out of reporting Sandusky. We know that he thought Sandusky could be reached in other ways--that he thought Sandusky didn't actually do that--how could his friend? What would you do if it was your friend?--and that if he did, he should confronted directly and reprimanded, because he could be changed like that. You have to understand that this is how everyone thinks--if one of your good friends does something bad, you reprimand them, you don't turn them into the police. You deal with it on your own, and they change, and everyone wins. This is how people are--that's how they think about people close to them. However, regardless of all this, JoePa is the reason why Sandusky wasn't reported in 2001. That is unacceptable.

Additionally, when JoePa was told of a rape incident in 1998 (2001? I'm not positive which incident), he waited two days to report the incident to his superiors because he ""didn't want to ruin anyone's weekend."" A kid had just been raped, and you don't want to ruin your boss's weekend? This was an increadible moral lapse, and it demonstrated an increadible lack of empathy for the child who was just raped.

So how do I feel about JoePa? I have mixed feelings. He was a great person who made two great mistakes. I'm not sure how to think about everything. I'm really not. I go back and forth between honoring him while realizing he's human, and feeling shame that he would do such a thing while being part of my university. For this reason I'm very glad that our current president, Rodney Erickson, decided what he did: take down the statue, but leave the library named in his honor--because this isn't a black and white situation. Joe Paterno was an excellent coach that brought the community together. He made a heartless mistake that could tear us apart. I don't know what to think about him anymore.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_x32ca,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/x32ca/my_friend_emailed_me_asking_my_thoughts_on_joepa/,

Information that went up the chain of command to the head of the campus police and the President of the School. The matter was in the hands of a world-class University and a President with an outstanding national reputation. Whatever the details of that investigation are, this much is clear to me; If there is a villian in this tragedy, it is in that investigation and NOT in Joe Paterno's response to it. And yet, for his actions, he was excoriated by the media and fired over the telephone by his University. In all of his subsequent appearances he never complained and he never lashed out. Every word, every bit of body language conveyed the message: We Are Penn State."" - CEO of Nike, Phil Knight, at Paterno's memorial.

LINK: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7507069&amp;categoryid=2564308

People seem to think that Paterno knew 100% for certain that kids were being raped and he turned a blind eye to it. It's really starting to piss me off. The rape was reported to him in a very vague way with no mention of sodomy or direct sexual contact, just ""horse play"" in the showers. This fact is directly out of the grand jury report and was recently confirmed by both Paterno and the coach who reported it. Regardless, the incident was reported to the Campus Police (which is the ACTUAL police on a college campus) and then it was in their hands. People like to put blame on Paterno for not doing anything when no charges came of the incident. But how was he to know that the matter wasn't look into? For all he knew, the issue was settled and there was nothing for him to worry about since the incident was reported to him without word of sexual contact. The truth is that the media hounded the person that would make the biggest headline, Paterno, and now people have this misguided idea that he is guilty of protecting a rapist. I hope that the words spoken at Paterno's memorial as well as my information here lead others to reevaluate their opinions by objectively looking at the evidence that we are presented with to make their own opinions without the media's garbage clouding their minds.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,False,,,True,t3_oy7yq,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/oy7yq/since_theres_some_confusion_about_joe_paterno_and/,

Here's what I mean: when the Penn State scandal first hit, everybody was trying to villainize and sling dirt on Joe Paterno. They were trying to portray him as some kind of monster, only caring about the brand of the football team rather than anything else. Some (though it isn't to say all) major news outlets were all too happy to slam Paterno, saying that his sacking was completely justified. Too bad Paterno was not Sandusky. While Paterno did do something horribly wrong by not alerting the proper authorities, it does not even compare with what Jerry Sandusky did to those children. Personally, I would have allowed the guy to coach what would be his final season. And now that Paterno is dead, we're all going to hear from the media outlets who mocked and trashed him what a hero he was. I'm sorry, but weren't they just oh-so willing to mock him just a few months ago? Please. You either treat somebody as a hero in both life and death or you do not.

Everyone may say that football is life at Penn State and that the game should've been cancelled, etc. but I saw the football game today doing exactly what it has done for years, bring our school together under a common theme.

Usually when our team is down 17 points in the 3rd quarter, the bleachers usually start to thin out. When our team manages to break our hearts with coming so close to victory only to fall short, the seats clear out without any real true acknowledgement of our team's efforts. Today I was impressed with how many people stayed through the whole game, stayed AFTER the game for a few minutes rather than quickly filing out just to give our team an ovation despite the loss as a show of respect. I'm also proud at the respect we showed the Nebraska fans who visited. We gave them the regular Penn State welcome that most people who follow college football have come to know as second nature to our community.

Whether or not you support our football team, think the season/game should be cancelled, etc. I think we can all be proud to know that our tight-knit community has come together and as Coach Bradley has said, it really seems like the healing process has finally begun (although I think it really started with the vigil).

* Feel free to spread the word/cross list this with other social groups.
* If it goes well, maybe we can make this a monthly event.",,False,self,t5_2rgmf,True,,,True,t3_iybnf,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/iybnf/reddit_meetup_hiking_cookout/,

Though I'm a certified Apple tech and a double BFA Art Major (graduated), I'm working at Qdoba as a cook. Been applying places like mad since the summer, but I'm not complaining, at least I have a job. It pays the bills and I enjoy working with food.

I'd be happy to ask any questions regarding that place, as it can get very busy during lunch and I'm sure some of you eat there. Also, if you're ever there during the day M - F, ask someone on the line for Chris and I'll see if I can hook it up for a redditor. I saw someone browsing in there during lunch one week, but I was super busy and didn't wanna bother (whoever you were).

",17,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/wpc27/if_the_sandusky_coverup_is_considered_an_ncaa/,"To my knowledge, the NCAA had not opened any formal investigation by the time the report was released. [Source](http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/dennis-dodd/19570190/ncaa-penn-state-now-needs-to-respond-regarding-possible-violations).  

As Penn State funded and released/allowed the release of the Freeh report, its content, by all rights, is Penn State airing its own dirty laundry.

In a powerpoint slideshow titled [""Division I Welcome to the World of Compliance - PDF""](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CE8QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffs.ncaa.org%2Fdocs%2Fregional_seminars%2F2012%2FPowerPoint%2520Presentations%2FDivision%2520I%2FDivision%2520I%2520Welcome%2520to%2520the%2520World%2520of%2520Compliance.ppt&amp;ei=iHgFUKnjI8WU2QXLlvW7BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNESNjBYe7yPVoYrUeZAV_tbLPmGyg), there is a slide called ""Importance of Self-Reporting Violations""(slide 33), containing four bullets:

*It's required (NCAA Constitution 2.8.1)

**It's a primary element of institutional control.*

*It's better to have violations and self-report, than not to report any violations

*It's necessary to resolve eligibility issues.


It would seem to me that the NCAA is at a bit of an impasse:  if one argues the Freeh report implies lack of institutional control by its findings, the mere existence of the report implies institutional control through self-reporting.


And yes, I understand self-reporting to the NCAA is a specific process with its own requirements.  Likewise, if one argues the semantics of self-reporting, it must be considered that the NCAA rules are designed to maintain a fair level of competition, not preside over criminal matters and cover-ups.

I was anti-Paterno, then pro-Paterno. Now, I am thinking of swinging back to the camp that is criticizing him. 

After re-reading the grand jury's report, it looks like the disconnect begins with Paterno. McQueary testified that he saw a boy subjected to anal intercourse. He later called Paterno and reported what he had seen. When Paterno called AD Curley, he said Sandusky was ""fondling or doing something of a sexual nature."" When Curley and Schultz summoned McQueary to a meeting, he testified that he said ""anal sex."" The administrators denied this. 

Schultz testified that, in another meeting, Paterno told Curley and him that Sandusky was engaged in ""disturbing"" and ""inappropriate"" behavior with a young boy. Schultz also had the impression from McQueary's report that Sandusky accidentally grabbed the boy when they were wrestling in the shower (b/c who doesn't do that?).

What it looks like here (and I want to be wrong) is that Paterno is the one who distorts the original story. The report does not get into the specifics of the conversation between McQueary and Paterno. So now I have two options. 1) McQueary never said ""anal sex"" (or an equivalent) to Paterno  (minimally absolving the coach). 2) McQueary gave the specifics, but Paterno watered the story down. Due to this watered-down report, Curley and Schultz never thought it could be rape, even when McQueary told them. 

So why would Paterno diminish the horror of McQueary's statement? A) The damage it would have to PSU's reputation. B) He could never imagine Sandusky doing such an act, so he thought McQueary must have been exaggerating. C) He was in his mid-70's when this happened, and could never get around to saying (or imagining) sexual abuse against a child. 

EDIT: This is probably the only thing making me an agnostic in this case. The deputy state prosecutor said Paterno ""did the right thing, and handled himself appropriately in 2002 and during the three-year investigation that ended Friday.""

We're one of the largest, most connected colleges in the world and I see no reason why our social media presence should be any less significant.

So I'm making a call out to you. To my fellow Alumni, to current and to prospective students. Let's win this competition!

So what could we do to attract new and **quality** members to the sub-reddit that represents Penn State? 

We can put up fliers? Post them on every wall and bulleton board possible.[ here's my first crack at it and I know someone reading this can do better ](http://imgur.com/z4enO)  (you can tell I was a business major can't you?) Maybe look into taking out an ad in the newspaper?

Do you have a vision to redesign the style sheet of /r/pennstateuniversity ? I'm all for it, what do you got?

Maybe we can have a rally? A back to school meetup to bring attention to the lurking Penn State Reddtiors. Maybe a journalist major wants do an interview with one of the reddit crew (I could help set this up)

Post your ideas away, let's get some discussion going. We got some time (August 26) to plan and move.

Edit1: A request has been made for [/r/PSU](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/j8tki/redditrequest_penn_states_biggest_subreddit/)

Current ideas:

* Use the PSU alumni network for some free advertising
* Put up Flyers (with a QR code?) at IT buildings and Computer Labs
* Get Freshmen involved while trying to keep the bros out.
* Get a new CSS
* Steal ideas from other college subreddits

Now I know this is going to be kind of an unpopular sentiment, but being redditors who on the whole tend to be very philanthropic, but hesitant with how their charities are actually run, I'm hoping someone can shed some light.

* First of all, the fact that people have turned THON into an event whereby fuckloads of merch is purchased and frat boys get to wear ""For The Kids"" hoodies while they shotgun beers is pretty fucking gross. It just seems like such an insensitivity to the issue of pediatric cancer, like these kids would want to see an overweight drunk student squandering their health while ""representing their cause."" That's one thing I have always thought was really bizarre. PSU manages to turn every event into something for drunks. No offense guys, but you know it's true.

* Second, the money raised: What does it actually *do*? I've heard conflicting stories. Some say it goes to fund ""research"" while others say it goes to the families of dying kids. My opinion is really that it should fund research, not pay the medical bills of terminal patients. As harsh as it sounds, there's no reason to dump money into some treatment that will only delay an inevitable death, rather than save countless lives in the future.

* Third, is the spending of this money in anyway ""open""? As we know, PSU is a well funded University and I would hope there is some way to trace where all of these generous donations go every year. Otherwise I do not doubt that the University revels in the fact the students, who are already paying tens of thousands of dollars a year, are throwing more money their way to do what they please. Does anyone actually pay attention after the fact to ensure that it is properly used?

* Fourth, what does the dancing aspect actually do for the charity? Are donations based on how long you dance for? I really don't get that either...

----------------

TLDR: I'm all for funding cancer research; I'm just curious if THON is what it says it is, or has it been turned into another 'party' for students (or marketing for local businesses) with very little actual benefit to a scientific/medical ""cause""?

Now, we have alot of stuff for this event, and we do like more food being brought. So far, we have these things to offer:
* Hot Dogs
* Water
* Buns
* Charcoal(maybe need more)
* Frisbee
* Chicken
* Assorted Cutlery
* 2 twelve packs of soda
* Watermelon
* Appetizer/Dessert
* Friendship(Need more of that definitely)

So, it would be totally rad if you brought something that we did not include, or just came to hang out. I scouted it today, and I believe we'll be at Pavilion 2, which is directly on the right side of the path coming into the park. If you want/need a ride, PM me, and I'll come pick you up and then fun times for all! 

Seriously. Let's make this summer series of fun happen.
