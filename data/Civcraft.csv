1367011159.0,270,self.Civcraft,1d6gt0,Well a disaster has occurred and it seems I only have myself to blame.,307,37,263,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1d6gt0/well_a_disaster_has_occurred_and_it_seems_i_only/,"After the DDOS one of our top priories was setting up offsite backups, ensuring that we could never again be strung up for so long without help. As always we put out a call for charity an unused machine or connection somewhere and as there has been in every step of our journey here people stepped up and helped us out. We had new hosts for CivTest and CivPVP provided and operated for us. I took advantage of one more offer by /u/LordSaehrimnir an unused server rented for the term of a year, it has fast bandwidth and small but decent sized disk. I decided to use it as our new remote backup server in conjunction with another location. 

Its not often we have the luxury of checking over those who offer us help, but here I will admit I did, but all did with that luxury was squander it, I checked the reddit account in a cursory manner and it seemed to check out. The machine was setup properly and nicely. 

I can never deny being perfectly cognisant of the risks being taken, but the alternative was using a machine to which backups took 2-3 times as long and due to its upload speed restoring them would take 13+ hours.  

So that was that, our new remote backup server. 

It does not take any sort of genius to guess why this post is being made. Hamster238 was the owner of this server, I had no excuse for not knowing that, they have a copy of the backups and everything that entails down to uncensored server logs. 

This represents a complete and total failure on my part as an administrator, its also characteristic of my character flaw, I am far too trusting and hopeful that things can and will turn out for the best. When the choice was presented to me to backup remotely or risk having the server be down indefinitely again the choice seemed to be pretty simple. 

They malicious players in this instance have restricted themselves to ridiculing me, which means revealing some facts about the administration team which could be interpreted poorly and placing up an alternate server with a copy of the map without any sort of protections to prevent it from being abused. 

This is better than I deserve right now. 

For more than a year now Civcraft has been my life, its the first thing I do when I wake up and the last thing I do before I go to sleep, it is a challenge that has nearly crushed me time and time again and somehow I have always found the strength to rise to that challenge and every time I wondered if there would come a day when I would throw myself at the next challenge and finally be crushed. Surely there was some limit to how much I could take? 

The irony of that limit being my own stupidity, my own positive attitude, my own tendency to trust freely and move forward despite doubts. I am not sure if I am crying or laughing, maybe I am doing both at once and that is what this feeling is. 

I have put every ounce of my life into this game, I long ago decided I would go on despite any personal cost, in the face of any challenge I would either surmount it or die trying. It is this attitude that brought me this far and this attitude that caused this situation. I held no malice for anyone I have ever banned or allowed to be banned, I always did what I thought was best, I made the hard choices when no one else could and it tore my apart mind and body. Sleepless nights constant, , nervousness, lost time with friends and family. These costs are as much mine as any major player's. Every time I asked if it was worth it I dared to dream one more time that this could be everything I thought it could. 

But its not about me here, this was always my greatest fear, betraying my players. All of your work, everything you have confided in the server, has been given away. I will never forgive myself for this and I will fully understand if you never forgive me for it and refuse to use any service I run ever again. 

As always I could man up and move forward, we can generate a new map, start fresh I guess. I had always planned on releasing the full map someday when it was all over. Hell we could even keep the one we have now, not that I think that would end too well.  

Regardless this is ttk2 signing off, I have a class to go to that I never told anyone about for fear of the server being attacked when I could not help, but I guess that does not really matter too much now. 

**I should make it clear, if there is one thing I have learned from what I have done its that you can only lose when you let yourself lose, Civcraft can live, but that is up to you to forgive me, I will be here.**

All the cities started crumbling, every enderpearl shattered simultaneously, the Nether started to fall apart and flood with lava. Some Portals started spreading a Nether Infection onto the land, causing the terrifying fiery dimension to form landmasses in our world.
Earthquakes fractured the land, oceans became deserts, mountains fell all around, uncountable cataclysms destroyed the world as we knew it.
Everywhere, people were screaming and crying, some in physical pain and agony, some for their enormous empires and treasures that the land was claiming back while they watched, impotent against the sheer violent power of nature.

But somehow... Somehow we all survived. No one knows how much time has passed, or what happened since the cataclysm. 

And if there is something no disaster will ever take, it is the willpower of humanity. We fall and get right back up again.

Recently, Supposed of the HCF made a post saying, among other things, that:

1. HCF is multiple groups. But he can't tell you what the groups are or who's in what group.
2. He's no longer pearling innocents. But he can't tell you who he thinks is innocent and still wants to PvP with people who may or may not want to PvP.
3. Plz stahp h8ing dem. No real reason, they're not changing much. They just have a different play style and we need to accept them for that.

Alright, let's hash this out.

HCF/WuTang/Neo-Hitlers:

I argued against the bans. I even argued for you guys to be able to play your style and accomplish your goals of ""pearling the ancaps/world police"". I thought the drama would be entertaining, and for a while it was. This doesn't mean I *supported* your actions, I just wasn't opposed to them, per se.

Let me give you an analogy of what you guys are doing. Imagine this was a card game. Everyone here is playing Texas Hold 'Em. You guys come in and start throwing the cards all over the place saying ""we just want to play 52 pick up. Don't be mad dude, we just have a different play style.""

If you guys want to play pick up, that's fine, but expect people to hate you. If you want people to like you, play Hold 'Em with us. Those are your two options and there is no middle ground.

So what does this look like in CivCraft?
1. Stop fighting/pearling everyone unless they attack or harm you.
2. Pay reparations to those you have harmed.
3. Quit bitching about people hating you and actually build your reputation by being helpful.

You are responsible for your own reputation here and that of your group. If you act like assholes, you will be treated like assholes.

If you guys want to keep ""playing your style"", that's fine. Just expect everyone to denounce you and expect me to resist you in any way I can. People here want to build cities, trade, mine and discuss politics. We accept that self defense is a part of this. People aren't here for another 2b2t.net or HCF server. That is the reality and why you are hated.

I'm not asking you to change or to continue what you're doing. That is up to you. I'm just giving you the reality of the situation.

Hell, you could still get your PvP kicks in while playing by our rules. Build arenas and hold tournaments for PvP. Designate specific areas under your control as PvP zones (with the rule that no pearling is allowed). I don't know, get creative (I know I'm asking a lot here).

1359932432.0,165,self.Civcraft,17tyg1,Civcraft v. Y_ankees,200,35,332,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17tyg1/civcraft_v_y_ankees/,"Y_ankees is accused of using an aimbot PVP hack in order to hit players in a way that would not be possible using the vanilla client. The specific mechanic at issue is the ability to hit players without looking at them and without aiming manually. [The evidence put forth by kingr8 and others](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17balc/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_for/) against Y_ankees was quite convincing. In [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_1lgE8hqk), Y_ankees can clearly be seen to be using some sort of aimbot to hit kingr8 (discussion below). The evidence provided in that thread alone is enough for a ban. Y_ankees, however, in a completely unrelated incident managed to blatantly x-ray snitches *while ttk was standing next to him, invisible* (which ttk will confirm below in the comments). This is also, by itself, evidence enough for a ban.

kingr8’s video is the primary piece of evidence considered. Y_ankees claims that what is seen on kingr8’s video is just lag, and that when he is seen attacking kingr8 without looking at him (something reported by several other commenters), he is merely looking where kingr8 was, and kingr8’s client is just catching up with that information. While that narrative is admittedly plausible, a careful examination of the video reveals that in multiple cases, Y_ankees neither looks at kingr8 nor looks at anywhere kingr8 has been, and manages to hit him quite a few times, thus discounting lag as a factor.. Y_ankees also hits him while changing direction, and hits him while turning to face other opponents. This behavior is also not seen in the other characters caught by kingr8’s video, as would be expected if this were a lag problem.

As corroborating evidence, Y_ankees was banned for hacking on HCSMP. While this alone proves nothing, taken with the other evidence it does seem to suggest that hacking is likely. Additionally, several witnesses noted the same behavior from Y_ankees’ avatar. Woundedgod even notes in one video that Y_ankees hits him even when Y_ankees is running in the other direction. The fact that this statement was made *during* the heat of battle suggests that it is reliable, as he presumably did not have time to manufacture such a story.

The x-ray violation (which, again, will be confirmed by ttk2 below) is cut-and-dry. Description of what exact behavior gave away the fact that Y_ankees was x-raying will not be disclosed, as it would possibly hamper future investigations. It is also worth noting that Y_ankees was accused of x-raying before by both Foofed and smmdz, and while the evidence was ruled to be inconclusive, there was a strong suggestion of foul play in that case.

**The crimes are x-ray and aimbot hacking. The sentence is a ban.**

*Note on compensation policy:* Anyone pearled by Y_ankees since Jan. 24th may form an orderly line and send their evidence to modmail. If you don’t have evidence but are 100% sure that he’s the one who pearled you, message modmail and we may be able to grep the logs to confirm.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_17tyg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17tyg1/civcraft_v_y_ankees/,moderator

Some of you may remember me from the ancapminecraft server, where I lived with StraightFoolish in his town.  Somewhat recently I have started playing on the new server, pretty much tending to my own things.  Recently I have become involved in some drama involving Laurelai and a few others, so I'm going to lay out my side of the story here and what I'd like to happen.

-----------------------------------------

It started a few days ago when I was moving through the overworld trying to get to my base.  I had on my inventory 2 stacks of white wool, 60 or so black wool blocks, 1 stack of yellow wool, 2 stacks of red wool, 31 diamonds, iron armor, and a few miscellaneous supplies which I don't remember nor care about that much.  

Anyway, I came across what seemed to be a town, so I entered in search of its nether portal.  Laurelai approached me telling me that this was her ""empire"" and that I was trespassing, so I asked her if I could use her portal.  Instead, she started chasing me down into her mine/storage facilities with her sword drawn, so I fled (luckily the server restarting spared me).  I admit that in my flight I definitely did remove some blocks, but nothing more than stone from the cave walls to aid in my escape.  Eventually, however, she caught up to me and killed me (but did not pearl me).  Yes, I was trespassing, and yes, her property is sacred, but I think the aversion to dialogue and the propensity to disproportionate violence is troubling (estoppel, anyone?).  Wandering into her land and asking if I can use her portal does not warrant murder and the theft of 31 diamonds, in my view.

After being unable to reach her for a day or so, she finally told me that my stuff was in a chest near where I died.  I showed up at her town and asked her if I could use her nether portal after I got my stuff, and then I saw her character toggle to a pearl, switch to a diamond sword, and run at me.  She attacked first, so I killed her with a pearl in my hotbar.  My plan was to bring her pearl to a secure vault in the nether and then discuss with her where my items were.  AFlatCap, a friend of Laurelai, offered to mediate and agreed to ascertain the location of my items from Laurelai while I held her pearl.  **Laurelai claims she has snitch logs of me griefing and stealing, but has not provided any evidence.**

However, it was then that Matticus_Rex's alt, PrincessBelle09 (or maybe PrincessBelle07, I don't recall) started chasing after Laurelai's pearl.  He tracked it to the location of the vault but he fell into lava and died trying to enderpearl his way out.  tbeau1 then showed up, and in a panic, I struck him with a sword.  Neither of us did any serious damage and we came to the understanding that tbeau1 was only there to retrieve Matticus' items.  Fine.  I talked with Matticus in-game more about the situation and he seemed receptive to what was going on and towards a possible diplomatic solution.

Then Foofed, Tutterise, and Exultant started tracking me and presumably radared my location and pearled me even after I explained to Foofed that I was dealing with things both with Laurelai directly (via AFlatCap, who was now searching for the alleged chest after getting coords from Laurelai) and Matticus (who had taken it upon himself to exact some kind of justice from me).  Foofed claimed that he only chose to intervene when he learned that I had attacked tbeau1, which doesn't really make sense to me given that I already apologized to tbeau1 (and I think, given the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for me to attack him).  Presumably Foofed and friends don't like it when other people encroach upon their monopoly on the use of force/pearling, because no one hired them to pursue me nor did they fully understand the context of my pearling of Laurelai.

Once I was pearled, Foofed, Matticus, Tutterise, etc. all left the area and Laurelai's friends broke her pearl out of my vault, leaving me trapped in the End alone.  AFlatCap subsequently told me that he and Laurelai could not locate the alleged chest with my items and that it was gone for good.  Laurelai continued to make threats that the ""Fempire"" would have me imprisoned indefinitely.

So, that leaves me to where I am now, trapped in the End by Foofed while Laurelai roams free.  I am out several stacks of wool, a set of iron armor, 31 diamonds (these things all taken by Laurelai), a set of Prot I diamond armor (minus the boots, which were not enchanted), a diamond sword with Knockback II Sharpness IV Looting II, one potion of splash damage, one golden apple, one iron pickaxe, 30 or so iron ingots, around 50 cooked steak, and possibly other small items which I do not recall (these things taken by Foofed/Tutterise/Exultant when they pearled me).

**tl;dr I came across Laurelai's town, she killed me and took my items.  She later said she had them in a chest for me, but when I showed up she attempted to pearl me, so I pearled her after she attacked me.  I was working towards a diplomatic solution via AFlatCap when Matticus_Rex, under the alias PrincessBelle07, started pursuing me in the nether.  We had a brief discussion and AFlatCap seemed to be making progress when I was pearled and my items taken from me by Foofed, Tutterise, and Exultant, who seem to have been acting under the auspices of some ""server justice.""  AFlatCap has told me that Laurelai said ""my items are gone"".  Laurelai got her friends to break her out of the End and she's now free while I'm stuck in the end.**

-----------------------------------------

Basically, I want my wool, diamonds, iron armor, iron, diamond armor, diamond weapons, potions, and whatever else either Laurelai or Foofed/Tutterise/Exultant have taken from me and I want to be released from the End.  I would also like another 32 diamonds provided by any combination of Laurelai/Foofed/Tutterise/Exultant for the trouble, drama, and nonsense this has caused and for time lost while in the End.

1356096624.0,142,self.Civcraft,1584zs,So here is your question. ,170,28,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/,"Ten months is a long time, I have been running Civcraft for longer than that. And for every single moment of it that burden has rested solely on my shoulders. Every single moment its in the back of my mind, what needs to be done, what needs to be said, and the worry that I may have those things wrong. For the past ten months I have been staring at the server terminal during nearly every waking hour, checking modmail and the subreddit every couple of minutes. Losing sleep, time with family, and time to myself in the name of trying to puzzle out the best course of action. There has not been a single moment in which I have been able to truly relax, to know any issues where handled. I have put more blood sweat and tears into the creation of this server than most of you will ever know, and my perfectionism seems to have achieved something. 

But I have my limits, and I realized that I reached them yesterday. When I saw that I had stopped really caring if the players where cheating or not, I had stopped really caring about anything so long as I could just avoid more drama, avoid responding to even just one more comment. 

I poured everything I have into every single decision I made for Civcraft and the result was always the same. Criticism and outright hatred for my person for failing to make the 'right' decision. I thought if I could just have made a better choice, found a better middle ground. I lost count how many nights I could not sleep  trying to find a better way out, a door number three in a controversial decision, or if there was even a right door at all.

What do I do about the breaking of the vault? Its funny, the one thing CItadel was designed to do no one has ever really done, its too hard, too much difficulty that every single edge case is found and exploited before anyone even tries to use the game mechanic I designed so long ago. Minecraft is kludges all the way down, I am Mojang's Sisyphus, the minute one problem is solved another shows up and the load never lightens. Always a new way to break Citadel, always another way to defeat the game mechanic and thus the point of Civcraft. 

This is the part where you expect me to reach my conclusion, finish another long post and *do something* because I am the guy that does *everything* here without break and without fail. You expect me to make a choice, make it happen, and then defend it here, of course you don't see the day I spend distracted and jumpy as I try and make counter arguments I am not sure of, or the habitual checking of my phone so that even while out I can not escape the consequences of whatever thing I decided is right. 

Well let me tell you somthing **I DONT FUCKING KNOW**, you heard me. I have no clue what the right course of action here is. I realized 8 months ago that I no longer knew which course was right or wrong, I realized yesterday that I had reached the limits of my ability to care about what was right or wrong for the server. I would no longer even argue with my fellow admins about what the right course of action was. 

I decided to take a vacation, leaving the server in the hands of the other admins, try to spend Christmas with friends and family, I knew I would probably come back to something more closely resembling a heap of slag than a server but I had hoped it would take more than one night. 

I present you with an ultimatum, I can come back, do what you expect of me, I can make your impossible decisions and manage this server. But for that to happen there need to be a lot of changes around here. Do you know why I keep Exultant around? Because he is the only one who can get *anything* server related done without me, *he lets me go to sleep when something comes up the night before my chemistry final and I am about to snap*. I need more help, more competent help in running this server, I need to be able to go to sleep knowing a situation will be handled, that someone is watching the server terminal for the next crash, that I can if for only few hours not be responsible for *anything* and *everything*. I want a night where I can not jump awake at every sound from my phone worried that something has gone wrong with the server. Those are the conditions of my continued employment here. 

No one, in their right mind wants to be a Civcraft admin, no one who really understands what the job is wants to do it because *they don't hate themselves that much*. Although apparently I do, because I came back. 

So here is your question, can you help me out here? Can you help me make this a job I can do without destroying myself? You know I used to ask everyone to stop calling me god, it bothered me because I did not want that responsibility, it only took a few days of Civcraft for me to understand that I would need to become one if I wanted to make this work. But I can not carry your burden alone any longer, it seems one can only play god for so long before he comes crashing back to earth. 

I leave the decision about Civcraft's fate up to you, because for today I am going to read my book, play some TF2, hang out with friends, and live my life. 

I wanted to create a community about forming societies, about solving problems between people, well I guess this is your test, I can't solve this problem but I can't go on with it being fixed. Its in your hands now, if you fail I guess there is always Rubicon.

I've been thinking for a couple of days now how best to write this post. I considered producing a final issue of the Pylon, I even tried recording some videos yesterday that I was going to cut together into an effortless youtube masterpiece. [That footage will never see the light of day](http://i.imgur.com/gbGiV.png). Instead I decided I'll just make a massive wall-of-text post, and hopefully cram some jokes in there. It's a fitting way for me to go.

I got a job... or more accurately, Noxy got me a job. I met Noxy during Issue 2 of the Pylon, when I covered his pearl release. We talked a little bit then and a lot since. Many months ago he left for greener pastures, and now I'm following him. It was on his recommendation that I got this opportunity, and I'll be forever indebted to him. Or, you know, I'll just buy him a beer and call it even.

Unfortunately the nature of this job represents a partial conflict or interest with the management of a Minecraft server, and I just don't feel comfortable holding any sort of administrative role here whilst being in this new position. It's on this basis that I [decided to resign two days ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tidzIZB1RdU). I'm handing in my badge and my golden helmet, and my green-coloured distinguishing powers. The jig is up. There are no more crimes here left to be committed.

Civcraft has been a [big part of my life for the past 7 months](http://i.imgur.com/gsmUZ.png). It was the first Minecraft server I've actively played. I was aware of online Minecraft before, but I'd never bothered with it. Creative builds and shitty PvP don't interest me. I stumbled across Civcraft randomly through a link on /r/Minecraft and, as I've evoked before, I immediately fell in love with the sidebar. 

In my few months of playing and many months of managing, the server itself hasn't always stood up alongside that vision, but it's always been interesting. It's always been engaging. It's always been informative. And for me personally, it's always been fun. The original content and the drama are like nothing I've ever experienced. My time here has been formative. I've truly learnt a lot and had a whole host of great times I'll recap in a minute...

I've made a lot of friends here, and one or two enemies. After all, you don't get to rank 25th overall for comment karma without making a few enemies. One thing I have noticed about enemies is that when you actually speak to them, it turns out they're just other human beings with slightly different views to you. [You know who you are.](http://i.imgur.com/9zEe0.png)

This server is special and it *is* unique, regardless of how you feel currently. There has never been another Minecraft server like this... hell, there's never really been another game like this. There's never been a game with real land disputes, with implemented law and imprisonment, with satirical newsletters from editors of high sexual prowess. It is, truly, an experience, and should be considered and remembered as such, even as some of you look onwards darkly. Think about how many other online games have made you feel like this... that's what's important about Civcraft. It's all the best parts of system design culminating in art.

There's way too many important names to list, so I'll just try to throw out a handful of those which I can, on the spot, remember; please don't feel bad if I miss you out, you know I don't mean it (unless I actualy mean it). People like egokick, exultant, erich, timmy, ride, TTK, erich, cixteen, matticus, erich, lightning, erich, farmcraft, erich, erich, hilter, erich, erich, erich, erich, manintime, erich, erich, *erich* erich, **erich**, erich, ERICH, erich and most importantly Dossier5 have made managing this community not a chore but a privilige. I will never forget those of you who aren't forgettable. Did I mention erich?

The server in my mind is a string of incredible moments. From Columbia to Panama (literally), through the Pumpkin Jacks, the first Pylon release, bitcoin drama, Columbiagate, and all'a'dat drama jazz. Every stupid meme that put a smile on my face. Every time a new player uses the phrase ""Admin Crimes"" to legitimately describe something the admins have done that he feels negatively about. And those moments in turn have shaped and cultivated a culture on this server that is like no others; a culture that is interesting even to outsiders who have no stake in the game.

#REALTALK time... I wouldn't have this opportunity if it weren't for Civcraft. I met Noxy through this server, and stayed in contact with him via this community. I printed a copy of the Pylon to show at my job interview. I used my experience here as an example of what I can do. For affording me this opportunity and experience, I'd like to thank every single on of you... I love you all, even the ones I hate. You are all special little snowflakes, and this chapter of my life will feature prominantly in my future Wikipedia page (listed under **Mistakes -&gt; *Regrets***). 

I'll still be on the Mumble, though probably less frequently, and I'll still keep up to date with the subreddit, although my posts will increase in value quite a bit, and I'm still involved in [SECRETS] [REDACTED] [THE THING YOU ALL AREN'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT BUT OBVIOUSLY DO].

It's been a pleasure serving you, and an honour pleasuring you. I wish you good fortune, success, happiness, and of course as many admin crimes as your future admins can commit. C'est la vie. Allons-y. French goodbye shit.

This of course means we need both large amounts of community feedback on what their ideal Civcraft map would be as well as some help for Orthzar in generating the thing. 

Next we have to get changes to our plugins out the door, an opportunity to break from legacy databases and code can help us move forward in a lot of ways. How should reinforcement values be adjusted during this next round? What about those experimental plugins we had on Civtest? Are any of them worth implementing in the long term? The only obvious thing for the plugins is to help out with JukeAltert as much as possible so that we can avoid PreciousStones entirely, since we don't have to do legacy conversion development there should be accelerated a good deal.  

With out alt script and logging plugins essentially open source now we may as well get the community to work on fixing them up and improving them. 

As for the treatment of the existing server, I am open for suggestions on how to keep it interesting during the development period for these changes. Zombie Apocalypse sounds interesting if a little cliche. 

Finally all of this is leading up to taking Civcraft full circle, since our hardware upgrade is incoming it would have been time soon to advertise once again so lets do it, this time with Civcraft 2.0.

Welcome to Civcraft, this is an experiment for communities, political ideologies, debate and discussion. Our backstory is based on history, not fiction. We’re forming a new direction for game-play, not just about surviving the elements, but about surviving each other, where players can work together to create and shape civilization or to watch it crumble. A world open to any idea, manifesto or philosophy, created by the players. We hope to push minecraft to it’s fullest potential in order to foster discussion, experimentation and community building.

I am ttk2 and the only thing you will see me doing is stopping cheaters and keeping the server online, order, justice, society, is all left up to you. There are no rules about how you do things, anything goes and my word is far from law. I wish you the best of luck surviving and thriving in this world. 


----
Our world, while limited in size, is still quite large. It is a circle with a radius of 15 kilometers, each block in Minecraft being one meter thick. When you join, you will spawn in a random location almost anywhere within the map. You may often spawn many kilometers from any other player, much less any sort of settlement. The in-game chat has a 1km limit, so any player more than a kilometer away will not hear your messages. This is done to prevent from being overwhelmed when we have more than 50 or so players online. [Mumble](http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php) is a voice and text chat program that is robust enough to handle as many simultaneous users as we care to throw at it without becoming a garbled mess. You can use mumble, the subreddit, or any other means to either find or promote locations to organize. If you are new to minecraft [this tutorial](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Beginner's_guide) should be helpful.

In an attempt to make Minecraft better suited to our purposes we have created a couple of custom modifications and adapted others to our purposes.

**Citadel**

Citadel is our protection plugin, designed to allow you to protect your buildings, doors, and chests from aggressors. It is built on the principle that protection requires resources, so to protect (or reinforce as it will be referred to) a block you must use any one of 3 resources: Clean Stone, Iron, or Diamond. Each one provides a certain level of protection. A stone protected block can be destroyed 25 times before it is actually removed from the game world. Iron is 250 times, and Diamond 1800.


* /ctfortify [security level]


/ctf acts as a shortened version of this command. Fortification is a toggle mode. When you type /ctf with no extra flags after it Citadel will detect the block in your hand and use it to reinforce blocks you place until you either run out of the reinforcement resource or run the /ctoff command to return to normal. As you place blocks the resource will be consumed from your inventory and about 10 seconds after you place them (to allow you to destroy misplaced blocks without undue effort) they will become reinforced with the material and permissions level you specify.


* /ctreinforce [security level]


/ctr acts as a shorthand version of this command. /ctr is a toggle command, and unlike /ctf it can be used to reinforce blocks that already exist without replacing them. Type /ctr and then right clock on the block you want to protect with the protection resource in hand, you will then be notified of the protection.


* /ctallow, /ctdisallow and /ctlist


These are the group management commands. Each player has a list of individuals that make up their 'group'. Use the command * /ctallow &lt;playername&gt; to add a player to your list, /ctdisallow &lt;playername&gt; to remove a player from your list, and /ctlist to see who is on your list. The default security level of /ctf and /ctr is private, meaning only you can interact with or remove the protected block. You can specify either public or group for any command that takes a security level (EX: /ctf public) public protections allow anyone to interact with them (open doors, or chests) but only the placer to destroy them. Group allows everyone on your list full control of the protected item, they can both interact with it and destroy it.


* /ctbypass


A toggle command. Once enabled, you can destroy your own protected blocks (or group protected blocks for which you are a member of the group) while only having to destroy them once. You will receive the block, as well as having a chance of receiving the reinforcement material. The chance is calculated (health when destroyed divided total health) in such a way that you will always get your reinforcement material back from a full strength protection but never from a protection destroyed without bypass.


* /ctinfo



Another toggle, once on simply punch or interact with a block to see its protection status.

For details on Citadels groups feature please see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/)

---
While Citadel's commands may be easy enough, there is a [philosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/rsr8c/on_griefing_or_the_philosophy_of_citadel/) behind its use that will ensure it provides you with the maximum protection. 

---
**PrisonPearl**

See [the wiki](https://github.com/matthewbot/PrisonPearl/wiki)

PrisonPearl also has an Anti-alt account component, the rules are simple, you can have as many alts as you want, but if two or more of them are imprisoned no accounts other than the Pearled ones may connect. This system is automated and is sometimes prone to false positives, please use the message the moderators button the sidebar if you have an issue that you think is in error. 


**PreciousStones**


While this mod has many functions we are only using one, the snitch block. Snitch blocks record players who enter, exit and interact with anything inside of a 11 block radius around the snitch block. To create a snitch block, simply craft and place a jukebox. To use a snitch block, look at it and type /ps snitch to see its log. Keep in mind there is no log until someone other than the owner enters the field, so it may seem like the block is not working until someone triggers a log event.
While standing inside of your snitch block range type /ps allow [playername] to add a player to the field, they will then not be logged as entering / exiting or making changes. 


**Physical Shop**


Place sign on wall above where chest will be. Keep in mind that you need to reinforce the sign as well as the chest with Citadel otherwise your items may be stolen.
Write on first line item name or number, enclosed with [] (square brackets). You may also add a sub-code using a : (colon).
On the second line, you may write ""Buy X for Xc"". Replace the Xs with the respective amounts that a user will buy from the shop for. Replace the c with the letter code for applicable currency
Our currency codes are
* g: Gold Ingot
* i: Iron Ingot
* b: Cobblestone
* c: Coal
* w: Wood
* v: Wool
* d: Diamond
* r : Redstone
* n: Gold Nugget
* l: Generic Log

On the third line, you may write ""Sell X for Xc"". Replace the Xs with the respective amounts that a user will sell to the shop for. Replace the c with the letter code for applicable currency


The fourth line fills automatically. Users with admin permissions (or, in the case of none-permissions users, Ops) may write [Server]. A [Server] shop without a chest has an infinite amount of stock &amp; currency. Remember that the signs are case sensitive.
Place a chest below the sign. You may put anything in the chest, but for the shop to work you must place the applicable item and/or currency.


Punch the sign to confirm it was set up properly.


Player may right-click the sign with applicable currency in-hand to buy from the shop.


Player may also right-click the sign with applicable item to sell to the shop.


**Mineralvein**


This is a passive plugin that changes the way resources are distributed in the game world. Instead of Minecraft's default even distribution of ores, the world contains large areas with thousands of blocks of a single resource (called veins) as well as vast barren areas where nothing but stone lies below the surface. Due to the size of our map the application process was not quite perfect, so you may encounter areas  closer to the center of the map containing the vanilla resource distribution, but these are rare enough to be valuable in and of themselves.


**WorldBorder**


World border prevents players from leaving the 15000 block radius circle that makes up our game world. This limitation ensures that players simply do not generate more land and more resources. When in the nether, you may go all the way out to 15000 block, but upon bulding a portal and exiting the nether you will be moved back within the limiting circle in the over world.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1349967209.0,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_rmbgm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/rmbgm/you_wake_up_in_an_unfamiliar_place_a_guide_to/,

-------------------------------------

The Map:
----

When you first join Civcraft you may notice that you ‘wake up in an unfamiliar place’. This means you have been randomly spawned within a 14km square centered at 0,0. Our map itself is a circle of 15km radius with quite a few customizations of our own including several custom biome types. Nether portals have been disabled and in their place Nether islands have been put in the oceans. The default ore distribution has been reduced to 1/6th the normal amount of resources in general but small randomly-selected areas throughout the map called veins contain much higher concentrated distributions of a single type of ore. At the edge of our 15km circle is a world border which will prevent you from passing beyond. Using Herochat, the general public chat is also limited to a 1km radius. Anyone further away will not hear you. 




------------------------------------- 

The Mods: Heavy Hitters:
------

Civcraft has five custom mods of primary importance to gameplay. 

* Citadel is our block protection plugin (see [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/kHJVX.jpg) for the basics). Citadel also allows players to have groups so that multiple players can access the same reinforcements. Citadel also allows you to create groups so that other players can access your reinforcements - read about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/).

* PrisonPearl allows players to restrain other players (see [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) for the basics). Keep in mind that every day you have a player pearled consumes 2 coal from the chest, if there is not enough coal the prisoners will be freed. Also PrisonPearl is integrated with CombatTag, logging out will not save you from being pearled. 

* JukeAlert (see the [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/t9DaPOS.png) ) which lets players use jukeboxes to track and record the actions of other players in a small radius from the jukebox. JukeAlert is integrated with Citadel’s [group system](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/)

* Factorymod is a complex tech tree with the goal of allowing more efficient production from resources.. It transfers of all XP generation over to crop growing. **You will not gain XP from killing mobs or mining normally**. [FactoryMod Wiki](https://github.com/gmlaxfanatic/FactoryMod/wiki) 

* RealisticBiomes is a mod to customize growth rates for various biomes to be more realistic as well as provide persistence in crop growth. [See the guide here.](https://github.com/Namrufus/RealisticBiomes/wiki/Usage)


---------

The Mods: Fine details:
----

Civcraft has a ton of more minor mods that handle various things. 

* [BottleO](http://i.imgur.com/ldQyZ.jpg) allows for convenient XP storage and transfer

* PhysicalShop allows for players to buy and sell items [see the guide here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=YrpYkjMa)

* Civpets allows the untaming of animals for ownership transfer by feeding them cookies. 

* Dyncap lets us adjust the servers player cap on the fly for maximum player/performance ratio, the player cap is not actually 500 players and is subject to change while the server is live. 

* Arthropod Egg allows the use of a bane of arthropods enchanted weapon to occasionally cause mobs to drop corresponding spawn eggs. Higher level bane means higher chance of egg dropping. 

* MusterCull exists to limit the number of mobs for purposes of server performance. If you keep too many mobs in one spot (like a concentrated farm) MusterCull will target them for culling.

1359205673.0,108,self.Civcraft,17balc,Evidence and Accusations Against Y_ankees for Using Force Field/Aimbot Hacks.,142,34,249,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17balc/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_for/,"The following thread is a formal accusation of cheating against ""Y_ankees"". I'm accusing him of using a force field hack, aka ""the jhoward client"". The evidence is as presented as follows.

During a prolonged fight with two sizable groups, many players were commenting that Y_ankees was using some kind of force field hack **(if you were there, please leave a post here with anecdotal evidence, I don't know if it will be considered but it can't hurt)**, so I engaged him to see for myself. The way in which he hit me was unique when compared with others I was also fighting with at that time, and seems to be closer to an aimbot than the traditional ""force field"". In the first clip of the below video you can even see how he somehow hits me twice as I'm flying away, the second time as I am already airborne.

In minecraft a player's head is orientated to face the same direction that a player is looking. Since you use the small crosshairs in the center of your screen to target blocks or other players when striking, it's impossible to strike one place while looking in another. Notice in the video how Y_ankees head is often facing away from me even as he hits me, both before and after striking me, and how many times he hits me in succession. To the moderator who judges this claim (I'm looking at your orthzar), if you are not experienced in what normal minecraft pvp should look like, I would highly recommend seeking some outside opinions from more experienced players, or at least watching [videos like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31RZ4bRu0Po&amp;feature=youtu.be), which show that even if players get turned around to face the wrong direction in combat they don't land hits on their opponent until they correct themselves.

Here is the video. I would highly recommend that anyone who watches the following video does so multiple times while reading this post, in order to see what I'm describing, as it might not be immediately apparent: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_1lgE8hqk

Here is [another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPufZsFvkdg) of a player using the same client hacks, on an unrelated server. The client hack in question is called the ""jhoward client"". ""J Howard"" is an individual who has helped develop No-Cheat, and from my understanding has developed his own client to get around it. Here is [a recording](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0tl1i0mKij0) (minus the voice of the person who recorded it, because it's hard to record both at the same time) of J Howard and some others (including ApatcheBlitz) talking with Josh about who J Howard has given his client to. He claims that he hasn't given it to Y_ankees, but then someone else mentions that someone could have shared it with Y_ankees, and is quickly shushed by others. J Howard even mentions that he's not going to mention any names about who he's given it to, as ""I told you I'm not telling...you're just going to go get them banned"", and ""if you're recording this mumble channel you've got evidence right there"".

Even if Y_ankees was not specifically using the jhoward client, his actions in combat were definitely well outside the norm.

**EDIT:** I would like to add [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17balc/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_for/c842haf) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17balc/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_for/c843nu8) by _sword as additional evidence, or background, or what have you.

&gt;After reviewing the video a few more times, there are clear times when Yankees is in range of a single player, yet there is no strike against said player.

Let me be clear: I'm not accusing Y_ankees of using a 360 degree forcefield. There's no evidence here to support that.

Although I think it deserves a real chance at being in Civcraft 2.0, I don't believe it will be successful on Civcraft.



One of the great things about Civcraft, and the reason we don't use client side mods, is that you can just put in the IP and play.  Even with the game-changing plugins like PrisonPearl and Citadel, new players can still jump on and immediately begin playing.  FactoryMod will stop many new players from joining, because they wil...


* Be too lazy to read how to use it


* Not realize that its in the game, and quit when they can't craft certain items.



* Not want to spend the time to build factories.



Now, at first you may say: ""These are the players we DON'T want!!!!!""
But, in real life, everyone isn't a politician, or master engineer, or a professional combatant.  We obviously want to attract intelligent, strategic players, but we cannot exist without the unwashed masses.



A big goal of the factorymod is to keep players in a centralized loaction.  To help, I have heard a lot of talk about making factories permanent, or have built-in reinforcements.  To me it just sounds like a griefer could enter a city and start placing factories in bad locations, which would be a weird but more successful grief than DRO.  So, either the factories dont have built-in reinforcements and we lose out on the centralized location ideas, or they do and we now have a big griefing problem.



Finally, FactoryMod was built primarily to improve Minecraft's tech tree.  It aims to make expensive items cost more and be more time consuming than in Vanilla Minecraft.  However, I feel FactoryMod actually RESTRICTS the tech tree.



Minecraft has a very simple system.  Because of this system, we have to rely on creativity and innovation (eventually meta-gaming) to achieve better and faster production.  The simple tech tree in Minecraft allows for easy personal gain, but can be exploited for better production by creating your own unique system.


FactoryMod inhibits this creativity by forming a (mostly) linear path that you MUST take to achieve items, and blocks creativity and innovation.  It is forced, something that I believe we should always avoid on Civcraft.




Like I said it is a great idea and i'm very impressed with all the work that has gone into it, but it doesn't fit with Civcraft's goals.  Also, no offense, but it isn't FUN.  And in the end, people play Civcraft because it's fun.



Thanks

Richard_T does not contest that he is responsible for breaking the dispenser (though Atrvmis actually made the final block break). While he does initially raise the question of his chances of finding the dispenser by accident, he then claims that he actually did not find the dispenser by accident.  Instead he claims that he was told by Midaas that there was someone still imprisoned in the vault and kept mining under the knowledge that there was still a container somewhere, according to Midaas.

[Richard_T’s words in his defense](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vilij): “The only reason I continued to mine was because I was told about there being a dispenser by another player.”

[This is followed shortly by a contradictory claim](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vj8a7): “It was because I assumed that the chest he was trying to go to had far more people. We wanted all the people possible for future plans that will soon be announced. These stolen prisoners were to play a big part in future activities planned by my separate group of HCF members, and so when I saw the opportunity for more, I had to investigate.”

Richard_T first claims that he was told about a dispenser (which the server logs show he was not. Midaas_ at one point says that he had a friend in the vault, by way of an excuse for being down there, but never says in what type of container the friend’s pearl was stored). Richard_T then claims he was looking for a chest with numerous pearls. In his next statement, he [makes a third contradictory claim](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vry2s): “I did not mine the vault in order to free this guys friend, but for the chance that there would be more loot undiscovered loot. I took over the mining to insure that we got any other loot and not him.”

The fact that his story is inconsistent is not in itself fatal to his case, but does tend to impeach his credibility.

Richard_T claims that he knew to mine around to look for it, given Midaas_’s implication that there was another container in the vault. Richard_T’s actions after this point at first seem to verify this story. Midaas_ and his associate were mining 2-3 blocks East and 8 blocks South of the location seen in Foofed’s pictures, where Richard_T’s group had dug down. Richard_T explicitly claims to have seen where Midaas_ was mining. Given this knowledge, one would think that he would mine in that direction, or mine further from Midaas_’s shaft down to where one could imagine Midaas_ would be mining to.

Richard_T’s first two block breaks seem to fit this narrative: he mines two blocks South from his own mine shaft, putting his end point 2 blocks West and 6 blocks North of Midaas_’s last block broken. The narrative, however, breaks down here. Richard_T claims to have changed his mind here, and changes direction, going back to his starting point and mining West (*further* from Midaas_ mining spot). This simply does not make sense given his story.

In order to more clearly demonstrate Richard_T’s narrative,  [I created a scale model in SSP to serve as a diagram.]( http://i.imgur.com/N1DHDgo.jpg) The blocks broken by Midaas_ are represented by yellow wool. Richard_T’s starting point is shown in magenta. The green wool represents his first two block breaks (obviously toward where Midaas_ had been) and the red wool are his last two block breaks (directly to the dispenser, which was surrounded by bedrock). Glass represents DRO and bedrock blocks.

To corroborate the charge of cheating, Richard_T is a known user of a hacked client (evidenced [by a screenshot he posted](http://i.imgur.com/nRKllUc.png)). While he was not using any illegal hacks at that time, that client is capable of x-ray. While this is not proof that he *did* x-ray, it does demonstrate that he had the capability to use x-ray and gives additional credence to such claims. ([See Precedent](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/13wqbd/evidence_of_summoner_cheating/c77uoyy)) Further, [Yakman stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1591dx/the_story_and_legality_of_breaking_the_vault/) that Richard_T had been involved in the World Downloader incident at the same vault (which is conveniently admitted by Richard_T in the same thread). While this also does not prove that he used that information here or that he used the same technique again, it does demonstrate consistency with exhibited character traits.

The vault in question is made up of over 4000 diamond-reinforced obsidian. There was a single hidden dispenser surrounded by bedrock on all sides but one. Richard_T’s defense would support continued mining to the South, but provides zero support for his sudden turn to the West, mining straight to the dispenser. In addition to this and the demonstrated and admitted capabilities of Richard_T, the evidence is clear and convincing.

**The crime is x-ray. The sentence is ban.**

Edit:

Since NJ seems to be trying to twist the story the following is the conversation I had with him, and his reaction to it.

http://imgur.com/a/gJpI9



So this is what NJ has to say on this matter

""I was hunting a griefer that hit a snitch near there portal, I had previously been friendly with RK so I had no idea what was about to happen. He messaged me asking me what I was doing there with a smiley face (again I expected to have a friendly convo). I said I was gerfer hunting to which he responded he doesn't like people on his property that are associated with josh and friends. I was dumbfounded as I'm not a part of that group (nor the world police) and I was attacked by xxTbxx before I was even able to respond. (may i add that xxTbxx was attacking aris just a few days earlier with mtfilo and toontasker). They were pearled in response to the attack on myself, and in the case of xxTbxx in response to aiding people that have the willful intent to harm the integrity of the server. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of guilt for you I'm sorry to say.""

First of as I mentioned earlier I have not had any interaction with NJ since I returned as far as I'm aware so all I know about him is what I see.

He claims we were pearled in response to the attack on him which we are allowed to do since he was the one violating our territory.....noone gave him permission to enter, noone said he could come on through hunting people.

There was 20 people online at the time why did he simply not message me ingame? he knew I lived here? why did he not come into mumble and ask me?

The answer is obvious because of his last statement where he says

""They were pearled in response to the attack on myself, and in the case of xxTbxx in response to aiding people that have the willful intent to harm the integrity of the server. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of guilt for you I'm sorry to say.""


It is obvious to me that he had a grudge against me and had full intention of simply violating my land to cause a fight so he could try to justify the pearling of us.

I have to laugh at "" wilful intent to harm the integrity of the server"" when I've spent the last 6 months quietly building a town pretty much on my own until recently at which point I have had numerous people join me bananafone31 for one who's primary reason was to escape the harassment of people it seems your consider to be friends.

So NJ if anyone is trying to harm the integrity of the server it is people like you who have no respect for other people and how they wish to spend there time in this game. Shown by your disregard of my land and it's residents.



Edit::

Been 12 hours now and still pearled, if we are not released within 12 hours ( 24 hours from when this thread was made) with full 2 full sets of prot4 + Sharp5 + anything else which was lost and justice done for there blatant disregard for our land then they leave me no choice but to pursue other avenues to attain our release.

1357524528.0,100,self.Civcraft,163em2,Evidence and Accusations Against Y_ankees and Ryko1412 for Cheating,152,52,412,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/163em2/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_and/,"The following thread is a formal accusation of cheating against players ""Y_ankees"" and ""Ryko1412."" I suspect that Ryko1412 is an alt of Y_ankees just used to mine, but am unsure. These two players are accused of using X-ray or World Downloader as a substitute, or similar means to see through blocks. The evidence is as presented as follows. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, within the last ~2 days, players Y_ankees and Ryko1412 were mining into my storage vault. Here is a picture of said vault: http://i.imgur.com/Om46D.jpg 

The vault is approximately 18x18 in surface area, + or - given it is not exactly square. This would give it a surface area of ~324 blocks. In the vault contained approximately 7-10 dispensers used to hold items. 

The following is evidence that Y_ankees and Ryko1412 were involved in digging **directly** down to one of this dispensers.   

* Location to the dispenser, evidence of breaking: http://i.imgur.com/zfLpT.png

* Evidence of breaking blocks directly above said broken dispensers:

 * http://i.imgur.com/x0Ajn.png
 * http://i.imgur.com/fhyXJ.png
 * http://i.imgur.com/00L2B.png

I think it is extremely clear given the evidence that these two players used X-ray to aid them in the raiding of my vault? Why?

1. They dug *straight* down on to the first dispenser they broke.

2. With a surface are of ~324 blocks, and only ~8 dispenser surface areas(a few stacked), **the chance that they dug down on this dispenser by chance is less than 3%.**

3. I see no plausible explanation outside of the use of x-ray or x-ray-like mods or tools that could explain this situation. Circumstantially, many of the HCF have admitted or have been known to use nodus/xray. Not that this is evidence in itself, but only makes it more plausible to believe the accused had used xray. 

4. The dispenser was not in the center of the vault, but rather displaced along what could be described as closer to the edge of the vault. Commonly, most people store things at the center of the vault, but instead of mining into the center, the accused mined directly down on top of the dispenser, which was not in the center. Only more evidence to suggest they had foreknowledge of the location of the dispensers before they started mining, gained through the use of xray. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relevant Parties Notified:

* Y_ankees: http://i.imgur.com/d85WR.png

* Ryko1412: http://i.imgur.com/AUxl4.png

Thank you.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: If possible, I would like to include further testimony from smmdz regarding Y_ankees xraying his base. 

* http://imgur.com/a/7YbCS

&gt; In the first screenshot, you can see a single wood block missing from the floor. Underneath it (sorry for the darkness) you can see the top of an obsidian block which is protecting my snitch.

&gt; In the second screenshot, you can see the snitch log proof of Y_ankees breaking a single wood block that just happens to be directly above my snitch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, if you take both the evidence presented by myself, which concludes that by digging directly down to my dispenser it is most certainly evidence of xray, and the evidence posted by smmdz, which shows Y_ankees and [alt Ryko1412](https://mcbouncer.com/userban/7580912) digging directly down to a snitch, then stopping when the saw the reinforced obsidian, that this player is blatantly using Xray, and doing so in a destructive manner. If you take multiple reasonable estimates that range from 2-5% in terms of digging down on my dispenser, and multiply that by the chances Y_ankee's randomly dug down towards smmdz snitch, it would indicate that both of these occurrences resulting in sheer luck would be far less than 1%.

After finding it on the main server I started tinkering on the Testing server, I started it up with only Spigot and NoCheatPlus, nothing, no extraneous region files generated at all. What was the difference then? Lots of players, so I pointed the Civtest port to the regular Civcraft port in hopes of getting the join spam and there it was again, extraneous region files being generated rapidly. I tried removing NCP and the generation stopped again, I added NCP and pointed Civtest back at 25566 and there it was, a few people joined but no extraneous region files were generated. 

It seemed that the only way to reproduce this but was to have nocheat+spigot and very very rapid joining of a server. I tried it with bukkit, Lo and Behold, it happened again, once again Nocheat + Joinspam = extra region files. 

The only conclusion is that this bug exists for every server running 1.5.2 Bukkit and NoCheatPlus (most of them) but it is entirely dependent on very fast join times. What has been happening to Civcraft over the past couple of days? Possibly the most join spammed server on the planet right now, other servers may generate an extraneous region file here or there but never enough to notice, I mean who counts their maps region files all the time? 

This is utterly ridiculous, the strangest bug I have ever seen, it could not possibly be right, I would be laughed out of #Spigot, so I just kept on trying it, and again and again it was reproduced perfectly. I may be missing somthing, I may not be quite entirely right. But I am sure of one thing, I am not in Kansas anymore. 

My primary suggestion for devlopers is to look through [NCP](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus) probably the fast join check it has, and see if we cant find it ourselves and patch the issue. 

In the meantime I am bringing the backup back on over to the primary machine and Civcraft should be ready to go back online soon, I think we can deal with simply clearing these chunks pretty easily but I would really really like a proper fix. 

How are the alternatives to NoCheatPlus these days? 

I may need to call upon you guys once again to try to join a testing server to test this bug, since its entirely dependent on having at least a couple dozen people join the server in the span of several seconds at the most. 

Now we could try and file a bug report, but they will likely consider us insane, If anyone else can reproduce this themselves I am also interested.

Go open some more slots or something, I don't know, you're the fucking computer geek.

Secondly: What's with all the new people? Civcraft is supposed to be community-oriented. And by that, I mean the community we established on the first iteration of Civcraft. We don't need all these other chumps polluting our fine server. Serious. Why the fuck are we letting all these noobs from /r/minecraft play? I bet they don't even know what the NAP is, let alone Ancap ideology. If we're going keep this server the fun, pure, community driven server we want it to be, we're going to have to kick all the noobies out.

Finally: What's with all the glitchy-ness? I know we're in the ""testing"" phase still, *technically*, but that doesn't mean shit has to be broken. I thought you egg-heads used the downtime to get all this shit settled? What the fuck was the point of civtest anyways?

The network engineering staff started putting in place DDOS mitigation procedures working from the outside in, meaning from the least affected servers to the target server itself. 

This tactic has brought all other servers in the row back online and running, including Atlas which hosts CivPVP as well as various other virtual machines. 

At themoment the DDOS mitigation for the target server involves rerouting all incoming data, meaning that while the server is running and operating just fine no external traffic can reach it. 

Since Atlas is running in the same data center it is possible for me to use it as a proxy to route traffic to Titan, this allows me access to the server and in theory I could create a bridge between Atlas and Titan in just a couple of minutes and allow everyone to play again. 

But to do so would be to open up the data center to another attack and circumvent mitigation procedures designed to protect the company, it would result in at least the termination of our continued free hosting if not the termination of Hex's job entirely.


At the moment we have no other option but to wait it out. We are extraordinarily lucky to be able to get free hosting, it is essentially the only thing that allows us to host a server this large without mandatory fees or pay to win features. Unfortunately if this keeps up we may have to strike out on our own for hosting and DDOS mitigation, both of which would cost hundreds of dollars per month at the very least. 


For the time being, unless the community can foot the bill or provide us a better deal, we are down until our benefactors decide it is safe to remove the mitigation.

I should also note that once we pass the 36 hour downtime mark I will try looking into other hosting solutions for now and the future. I hope to have us up by the 48 hour mark rain, shine, hell, or high-water.

1367337183.0,88,self.Civcraft,1df0lt,My ideas on Civcraft 2.0,112,24,307,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1df0lt/my_ideas_on_civcraft_20/,"Wanted to bring the ideas of ttk2 and some of the other great ones I have heard along with several of my own ideas, to generate a set of attributes to make Civcraft 2.0 the best it can be:

This will be A LOT of text, I will bold words and ideas to make it easier to skim.

**Size:**

This is still being debated, some want larger, others smaller. The world as a whole will certainly be apparently larger since there will be **NO NETHER**. Personally, I prefer a larger world. If we want scarcity, control that by ore distribution. If you want player density and conflict... make people want to live close to each other though mechanics. without nether... living near a city is the only way for trade.

Why larger? I would love to have a **60k radius world** ... I want to hear of a group of raiders terrorizing a certain region... wanting to be involved, but knowing.. I **could not project force** to that region without abandoning my city to also be attacked.

EDIT: **30k** would still have the same idea, 3 hours to travel across

EDIT: Wildweasel's idea. Scaling world border. Every month the world border expands 1 or 2k. The world starts small, but every month, there is always a new frontier... untouched by Steves. This would allow you to start small.. maybe 10k radius. By the time a year goes by.. it would be 34k. This would very much be like the New World.. everyone lands in New England... but over time, new frontiers are revealed and conqured, along with the resources within them. This idea also kills world border vaults as any more than temporary deals, would also allow a square world border (less server load) without the sillyness of corner vaults.




EDIT: I remember the other problem with worldborder. Disk space/backup times. Would have to balance this with admin team.

Travel would be a BIG DEAL. Couriers... traveling tradesmen. A large map encourages each region to generate **UNIQUE CULTURE**. Every region will need local providers/tradesmen for goods, instead of relying on a global market. I know this idea will probably be of much debate. Civcraft 1.0 was a small world. Approximately 3750 in radius (take into account nether). Instead, lets make the world a large mysterious place. Some places, to dangerous to travel, others, quiet and pristine. It should be impossible for 2 people plus a few helpers to build the entire world's roads.

**Biomes:**

There should also be **Large Biomes**. This combined with other things I will discuss, such as a toned down realistic biomes, mineralvein, etc.. will make biome location actually matter, and will encourage economic and culture distinctions between regions. This is already being done with the mod **TerrainControl**. I also think there should be **no painted contour maps**. They are boring and lose the ""minecraft feel"". It just makes rolling hills everywhere.

**Nether:**

So, we have established no nether, well, where are the resources? Go explore your big world. There are dangerous **hell biomes**, that contain the resources you so crave. You will find ghasts... nether fortresses... glowstone, and lava there.

EDIT:
Another idea, that I am really starting to like.

**1:1 nether, with pre-generated regenerating portals**. These would be fought over, as conduits to nether resources (like hell biomes), but eliminates some of the lag/ugly issues of hell biomes.

**Ore Distribution:**

I think most people are agreeing on how this should be done. Reduced vanilla distribution EVERYWHERE. I have heard the number 1/6th thrown around... sounds good to me. **1/6 vanilla distribution**. On average this means 1 diamond ore per 2 chunks.

Now, veins. As we saw on Civcraft 1.0, veins don't make people work together. They are hoarded and cleaned out in secret. Random nobodies get lucky, and are suddenly set for the rest of their server career because they found a single vein. This also has a poor effect of benefiting those that are willing to go to less than legal ways of finding veins. My proposal: small veins only. Diamonds will be rare, and one or two hundred diamonds will be a massive haul in comparison. **smaller, more common veins** should make long term prospecting worth while, without making it a big lottery system. Mineral Vein also has the ability to **restrict veins to appearing in certain biomes**... This could add more intelligent ""prospecting"", where you search for a suitable place, and then prospect it hoping for veins of the desired type. **No natural reinforcement**. It is not fun, and there are other ways to encourage teamwork then breaking the block over and over.

EDIT: Vein ideas. See Wildweazels post:

&gt; I think this overlayed with reduced vanilla ores is the best solution. I imagine something like 1/6-1/4 ores over the whole map, with areas on the scale of 1km2 that also have near-vanilla or higher concentrations of a particular ore.

&gt; - Relatively realistic
&gt; - Veins aren't obvious, and take serious prospecting to scope out
&gt; - One person can't possibly clear a vein in a reasonable time
&gt; - Finding a vein is not an instant win
&gt; - Regions with concentrations of ore are more valuable over a longer term
&gt; - Players must project ownership claims over a large area to secure veins
&gt; - Mining a vein region is roughly equivalent to vanilla mining, so it's at least as fun as mining elsewhere

**Factory Mod:**

We have all played with this. It is rough? challenging? Yeah, it certainly scales the difficulty. Like ttk2, I think that it would to greatly discourage new people. Instead, we are already limiting advancement with scarcity. **Technology (Factory Mod) is a way of mitigating scarcity**. Basic machines are slightly more efficient. Maybe 10-20%. You can make 10 swords for the cost of 8. Advanced machines become much more so, but with an upkeep cost. Maybe something like... 40% more efficient, but you need to make 20 of them in a month to break even. Those equipping and feeding armies will certainly go the route of advanced factories. Working together and pooling resources has a distinct advantage.

One possible idea is: **restrict diamond gear to Factory only**. Only those willing to invest in static factories will be able to reach the pinnacle of technology. This would impact getting basically established on the server. Looking forward to the debate on this one.

**Enchanting:**

FactoryMod also has enchanting. I would love to eliminate XP grinding... but I am not sure that NPC drop grinding (for factory mod) is necessarily the answer. **One possible solution is banning alting and bots?** I am still concerned that this forces a more heavily moderated environment then we prefer. There are other ways of changing the mechanic. Making mobs take damage when their numbers exceed X per chunk would massively **nerf drop/crush grinders and dark rooms** without impacting vanilla spawning as much. Ideally.. XP would primarily come from manually killing mobs, and ""doing work"" such as mining/smelting/etc. One alternative is to try to take all focus off mobs for XP. Keep vanilla enchanting mechanics, but make a **xp orb factory** with a high upkeep and initial cost. These would be low lag compared to mob grinders, and encourage people to work together. 

The last idea that occurs to me is making tools/armor that is made from **advanced factories naturally enchanted** occasionally. I think this may be one of the best ideas. Mass production of gear would have a percentage be enchanted, which could be combined on an anvil (requiring XP). An XP bot isn't a win button... you need to invest in an advanced factory and mass produce equipment as well.

EDIT: Optional way of handling XP. Have nothing drop XP. Makes xp grinders nonexistent. Instead, have **factories convert food into XP bottles**. Still has capital investment, but is a far less lag intensive solution. Preferably requiring certain recipes with foods from multiple sources. Maybe beef+wheat+nether wart+bones = XP.

**Potions:**

 I think potions as it is... ok. It is deterministic, yet requires diverse materials. Perhaps making certain of the materials rare, but have factories for mass producing them as mitigation for this may be a good option. Already redstone and glowstone will be harder to get a hold of.

**Realistic Biomes:**

I would really like to see this refined and put in place. Perhaps not quite as much as the starving simulator that we had in place, but as a way to extend the **scarcity mitigated by factorymod** concept. I like FactoryMod's cooking concept. By making spawn rates/growth rates really low on suboptimal biomes, it encourages biome choice to matter. There should be trade offs here. Do you pick a lush, easy to grow place where **food is plentiful, but ore is rare?**, or do you pack a sack of food to a dangerous place to pillage its riches...Property implemented this should encourage factories to feed large populations.

**iron and gold farms:**

To be honest, I have been an advocate of these in the past, but realistically, I don't think they can be balanced with scarcity. **Make iron and gold a nonrenewable resource.**. Remove iron ingot drops from zombies and iron golems (keep the hats/swords/etc). Remove gold nugget drops from zombie pigmen.

I think that is all that I can think of.. I will edit in more as I think of it.

EDIT:

I think chat range should be reduced to 400-500. This will encourage cities to be built next to each other (and still have personal chat space). Without nether, I think this is a must (else you have to build 1500+ apart to expand and not step on each other's chat ranges)

EDIT: **Citadel changes:**

1.  XP grinding is boring and gives a large advantage to botters
2.  Farming is only difficult at the begining of the game, mid to endgame it is trivial.

**Solution**

1.  Create recipes that convert collections of crops into XP bottles, requiring farming to gain experience and enchant.
2.  Remove all vanilla sources of XP
3.  Update enchanting to 1.3 mechanics as outlined in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1da63i/concerning_enchanting/).

**Benefits of Change**

1.  Farming is more enjoyable than XP grinding
2.  With recipes that require multiple crops and realistic biomes, enchanting will require constant trade between biomes.
3.  There will be less lag from monster spawning
4.  Farming will have a substantial role in both early game survival and late game technology
5.  This will require minimal interference with vanilla mechanics, it may be possible to even keep mob XP drops but serverly nerf them.
3.  Capital costs could be instituted using more efficient factories, decreasing the ability of players to get high level enchants quickly.
2.  Bots will not give an advantage to players
4.  Spawners could be used for things such as making veins more difficult to mine (ie. place a large number of spawners in each vein)

I would like to hear peoples thoughts on this idea or modifications of it. Also to note, while factorymod can do enchantments, its not quiet as good as the vanilla system, and is a fairly large change which I think we should try to avoid.

You are not free whose liberty is won by the rigour of other, more righteous souls. You are merely protected. Your freedom is parasitic, you suck the honourable man dry and offer nothing in return.

 You who have enjoyed freedom, who have done nothing to earn it, your time has come. This time you will stand alone and fight for yourselves. Now you will pay for your freedom in the currency of honest toil and human blood.

The call to arms rings out across the dark voice that is the server. Its toll is answered by the iron willed devotees who are themselves but humble servants of a greater power. 

Who among the teeming hundreds of players has the strength to answer the call and march to war? Come forth you mighty warriors, gather under the bloodstained banners and grisly trophies of conquest! Join now the massed throng whose aim is to rid the server of its blighted fate.

If there is any blatant misinformation in this post, send me a PM so that I can edit it quickly*


##Civcraft is in an interesting position right now.  I feel that in a few months, we will look back and see how important the events that are occurring really are to shaping Civcraft.  My goal here is to basically summarize what has happened in 2013 (and a bit before) so far.


##With so many conflicting views and ideas concerning the current state of Civcraft, I feel this post will be useful in centralizing everything so we can more easily discuss how we want to move forward.  For the most part I will be speaking in generalities, so if you feel I've described something as the opposite from what you experienced, keep in mind that I am focusing on the general population rather than specific individuals.


**I will be summarizing the events that have taken place from the HCF invasion until now, as I think a backstory is important.  Its a bit of a text-wall, so if you have a good grip on what has happened recently, go ahead and skip down to ""This brings us to today""**


**Alright, here we go.**


The HCF first appeared to be a welcome member of society.  They presented a new challenge to the factions that had held power for most (if not all) of the time Civcraft had existed.  The HCF arrived claiming to want to destroy the ancaps.  The HCF successfully took out many of the ancaps' primary players, sending the rest of the ancaps into hiding.  With the world power so easily pushed out of the way, the HCF realized there was really no one to get in their way.  They could do whatever they wanted.  And so they did.  The Christmas Massacre occurred, with an estimated 50 pearlings.  Civcraft was devastated.  Concentration camps were opened up (Wutang Resort by MrTwiggy being the most famous) and server morale continued to drop as the pearled number increased.  During this time the first question you asked someone was: ""Are you HCF?""  They had complete and utter control over the server.  


The sad truth is we overestimated them.  The citizens of civcraft combined had so many more rescources.  Also, we had vast numbers over them.  It was our inability to band together that stopped us from overcoming them.  We were unable to put aside our old quarrels to defeat the real enemy.  Also, we hoisted them up on pedestals as being unbeatable pvpers in a game where a combination of fast internet connection and a strong index finger are all that truly matter.  **We defeated ourselves.**  The rumors spread through the streets of the invaders being gods forced us to run and hide as they roamed the nether highway freely, pearling anyone in their way.  Even after all the cities they had destroyed and all the players they had pearled, we believed them when many claimed ""We are not all one group,"" and ""we want to be a part of our own society.""  They let it seem as if we were ok to go back to the way things were, and immediately crushed us again.


As January rolled by things slowly began to calm down.  Many of the high-profile HCF (Spurion, Gordge, MrTwiggy, etc.) had left already, leaving vaults full of prisoners.  The server limped on for the rest of January and the beginning of February, still for the most part in hiding from hot-head HCF players like y_ankees and mcfluffykins that still pearled for the most part without discretion.  Then, y_ankees was banned.  Many Civraftians naively rejoiced, celebrating ""The end of the war.""  many veteran players argued (correctly) that we could not celebrate yet, as this was just one player and they would most likely retaliate for the banning.  Another strong wave of HCF attacks came after y_ankees was banned, (possibly including y_ankees himself on a VPN).  The server was discouraged yet again.  However with the later banning of richard_t, the HCF began to crumble.  Also, with an introduced pearling cost of 4 coal a day, things were looking bright.  Although the server had its moments of inner struggle (see [Aristopolis vs. Buenos Aires](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18qd5v/a_full_account_from_gondolin_of_the_battle_in/)) for the most part Civcraft was united.  


The official end of the war came near the end of February, when all prisoners held in the World Border Vault were released.  This consisted of roughly 40 powerful civcraft players (and thier alts).  Civcraft celebrated, and this time it seemed the HCF threat was finally gone.  Many new cities began to spring up, and remaining HCF either reformed or were hunted down.  


**This bring us to the last month or so, and the topic of our discussion.**


Things were very peaceful for a couple weeks.  New cities, factions and movements like Myra, Civcraft PublicWorks, Fellowship, NCO, Sørenstein, Trotskygrad, Elephantine, Arx Republicus, CivCraft Maesters, Montagna, Cymru, Myraid, were created.  Everyone wanted to get a foothold on the suddenly rapidly expanding political and economic aspects of civcraft that had been suppressed by the HCF reign.  Civcraft seemed to be entering a Golden Age.  The only ""problem"" was the power vacuum, however many argue that this was a good thing.


Then, something very interesting began to occur.  Groups of alt accounts based on popular civcraft memes began popping up.  They griefed, stole, and killed.  The fact that they were clearly alts of current civcraft players, and that they did not pearl anyone, gave insight into their intentions.  


* Because they were not pearling, they had no lust for power.  They were no after server dominance.  From this we could conclude that they were not HCF.


* Alt accounts based on civcraft jokes told us two things.  These players were obviously involved civcraft players.  Also, they were probably influential and well known enough on their main accounts that they needed alt accounts to grief/steal/kill without repercussions.  


All these points were made by numerous people, and the evidence pointed to one group of people: The World Police.  Although not one uniform group, the ""World Police"" was quickly gaining power and influence, and arguably on its way to being a ""World Power"".  Suddenly the world of Civcraft was scrambling to determine who its friends and foes really were.  Was that bounty hunter they had given group permissions to actually griefing their city behind their back?  Or maybe he wasn't a bounty hunter at all, and was helping another city prepare for a conquest!


With the server divided yet again, HCF struck. 


Many don't realize the importance of this second attack.  Many don't even know exactly what happened that day.  This is because the HCF were quickly stopped.  A few powerful players were pearled, and vaulted in a new World Border Vault.  By the next morning, 15-20 fully geared players were either at the vault crack, or patrolling the nether roads.  The vault was cracked in roughly 12 hours.  No HCF dared to fight back.  Perhaps one of the greatest days in civcraft history had transpired without much ceremony.  Why is this so significant?  


Civcraft, for the first time, successfully beat HCF.  Even at the end of ""World War One,"" the HCF had not really been beaten, they just petered out.  This time, they were completely blocked.  They were present on the server for maybe 24 hours total.  


With this great victory, one would think ""The World Police"" would be supported and celebrated by all.  However, the exact opposite occurred.  The ""gimmick brigade,"" as it began to be called, continued to grief, steal, and kill.  Even with the large bounties placed on them (which would normally attract the always bounty hunting World Police) they ran around freely, doing as they pleased.


The LSIF eventually stepped in (see [woundedgod's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1a6q6o/out_bleeding_madras_for_being/)) with their alt list compiled from the LSIF-run server CivPvP.  With 008Shock and (later) Bleeding_Madras exposed as being behind two of the Gimmick Brigade accounts, distrust of the World Police reached its max.  Even when chasing a well-known HCF member who had commited several crimes (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1ac7ps/wanted_cliffnerd5_masterful921_kempje_50d_ea/)) the World Police were questioned.  





**This brings us to today.**

**With the impending storm of drama that will most likely result from the LSIF releasing the Gimmick Brigade alt list, I would like to open discussions on the current state of Civcraft.**
 
 
 
 .


.


.


**First Point:** ***The Absence of Powerful States***

A sad truth in these times is that there is no conventional state that holds true power.  One argue the LSIF, however with their spreadness and love of remaining hidden, they don't currently hold a position of power.  One can argue that they pull the strings of the server from behind the scenes, but for our purposes in discussing state power, they remain obsolete.  


Aristopolis is a good example.  Although joked about, the idea that Berge had ""40 men in prot"" was always in the back of your mind as you traveled through its streets.  For a while, it seemed Aristopolis was a world power.  This was disproven when a group of players that previously had only slight relation to each other were able to defeat it in battle.  Although still a wealthy and renowned city, Aristopolis, like so many other cities, holds no true power on the server.


Danzig is another good example.  Fairly secluded, yet quite rich, Danzig has the potential to be a world power.  Especially now with ownership of the railways, they hold a lot of influence in Civcraft.  However they lack the support a large population that would be willing to support the state through either military operations or economic plans, thus losing a good chance at world power.  


So who does hold the power on Civcraft?  Well, at the moment, no one.  However the players with the most *potential* for obtaining this power are those who really have no connection to a traditional state.  Players in places like The Works and Myra are only *technically* connected to those states, but have only a small obligation to actually work for, defend, and stay in these cities.  While these players (consisting of various factions like World Police, Josh and Friends, and ex-Danzilonians) hold a fair amount of power, they have no real connection to a state.  Sure, they live in a city, but these cities only really act as locations, not actual countries.  These states will most likely never participate in a real 'war' or have any real internal politics.


**tl;dr #1:**     


**At the moment, there are no actual 'states' with a dedicated enough population to be able to gain world power.**


.


.


.


**Second Point:** ***Capitalism vs. Socialism***


This is an always-going battle on Civcraft.  We may never know which is the better system.  This is actually a real-life conflict that CivCraft simulates well.  I've boiled this down to a pretty simple question:


What is your goal on CivCraft?


* If you answered to create a strong city, then you use socialism.


* If you answered to become rich, then capitalism is what you want.


*But wait... this is obvious right?*


Yes, but its deeper than you think.  The problem is, you have sacrifice one thing for each system.  If you choose socialism, you most likely will not be very wealthy (personally) but will be completely supported by your state, and thus be connected and devoted to it.  On the other hand, capitalism will allow you to become a wealthy individual, but not be truly connected to any group of players.  


I have personally experienced both sides.  I began as a socialist in Buenos Aires.  I really enjoyed the community and the connection to the state.  I had a sense of pride for my country.  However, when it fell, I decided to try capitalism.  I have since become a fairly wealthy individual, however I miss the sense connection to the other players and your home.  In Civcraft, it all depends on how you want to play.  


My opinion is that if a group of wealthy players (derived from capitalism) came together and formed a socialist state, they would be unbeatable.  Backed by the wealth they had earned, the state would grow geographically and socially, with new players entering consistantly. With a strong quota system, it could very well become a world power.  The citizens would be devoted to their city, and at the same time be profiting personally.  

*Socialism and Capitalism together?* Not possible.


I dare someone to try.


**tl;dr #2:** 


**I actually would like to see these coexist.  Using capitalism to gain wealth, but basing the state off socialism to ensure the population's devotion.  May not be possible, but if successful would be an unstoppable force.**


.


.


.



**Third (and last/most important) Point:**  ***Who will fill the power vacuum in the next era of CivCraft?***


This is the question we all have been asking since the end of the war.  No state is currently powerful enough to step up.  Individual players (World Police, Josh &amp; Co., etc.) simply don't have enough people to seize control.  *So who will step up????*


I know you won't like to hear this, but the HCF were legitimately the best faction on this server.  They were organized, powerful, wealthy, good fighters, intelligent, and loyal to one another.  They struck hard against thier opponents without fear of the repercussions.  



So who will be the next 'HCF'?  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the relative peace and safety that the server is currently experiencing.  However it will only be a matter of time before someone realizes that there is no existing faction well-organized enough to sieze control of Civcraft, and attempt to take control. 


**Who will it be?**

I first started playing minecraft with just a couple friends and none of us ever heard of or considered using exploits in the game.  Eventually our small server grew a bit bigger and after posting on reddit, there were dozens of people daily and it grew pretty well.  Other than the occasional idiot who just wanted to destroy someone's work, everything was fine.  After a while we ended up steady at about 50+ players per day.  One day, we discovered that somebody was just giving away diamonds rather liberally and discovered they were using an xray mod to harvest them.  We didn't know the difference between the texture pack and mods until then.  This increased over time and we needed more moderators to police the server which was hard to do.  Later on, somebody discovered how to dupe items and this apparently went on for a while before somebody noticed when the spawn was covered with stacks upon stacks of them.  Naturally, I felt that all my time getting the assets I had were pretty much worthless and I grew disinterest and quit playing there.  I got bored and found other servers that the dupe glitches worked on and decided to have a little fun.  I found xray mods and found it fun to sneak in and loot hidden chests buried everywhere and listen to the commotion.   Eventually that got boring and I looked into other exploits to get my rocks off.  I found stuff like Zombe that lets you fly all around and before these nocheat mods, you could pretty much get away with it unless an admin or someone saw you and snitched you out.  The mods grew more robust that let people protect their work such as protecting blocks and doors.  I found mods that allowed you to freecam around and loot chests in these protected areas if you couldn't break blocks and people could never figure out who did it.  It was awesome.  Me and a small group of friends would go around raiding servers just for fun and we pretty much lost any will to play the game how it was supposed to be because so many people had the same tools and cheated in the same way.  This grew to PvP style servers where we learned different tricks to pretty much guarantee winning a battle with the most hilarious being freelook cheats hitting and killing someone from 40 blocks away and being invisible.  Things like this were eventually patched and other ways were found to cheat.  One day I was jerking around when somebody caught me and accused me of using ""Nodus"".  I was like wtf is that, don't play stupid etc. etc.  so I looked it up and found the nodus client which was actually pretty sweet with many new tools I never dreamed of before.  I actually liked minecraft and wanted to play a legit game so I would often ""test"" servers with nodus to see how easy it was to cheat and if you could, I'd either grief them and leave, or just not bother and leave.


Then one day, a friend found civcraft of which at first I said was stupid.  The first thing I did was load up the client and I noticed that they did a pretty good job of patching things up (Good job ttk2).  You couldn't find ores with it, you couldn't fly, you could do pretty much anything other than PVP style exploits of which was a sizable challenge from griefing whiny 13 year old's DSL line servers.  Also, you couldn't possibly get banned unless someone had irrefutable proof so it wasn't like these servers run by 13 year old boys who ban you because they ""suspect"" you're cheating without proof.  The group of us got together and built a modest empire and of course the whole getting attacked/attacking/getting pearled/breaking pearls out thing happened so we had the need to put things more in our favor and Nodus simply didn't cut it.  One of us was fairly good at coding so we started to get ideas for making our own client that was specific to things we needed to do in civcraft.  Some of the features we implemented were, Xray (of course).  PVP enhancements which were a bit like autolook and forcefield built in together from the nodus client, and tweaks to do speedhacks for short bursts without detection.  This involved things like going at 0.00 speed for a short time then 3.00 or more speed for a short time.  This gave a huge advantage of making it look like we stopped chasing our enemy only to make them stop for a moment at close radius, say less than 20 blocks, then run really fast towards them to do an unexpected attack.  There's several others that involve being able to stand still with nopacketTX and not take damage at close range (or give it) during critical moments.  Other things in our client include vaultbreaker which combines automine, autotool of nodus like clients while scanning the radar and the moment a person not on your friends list comes within radar range, you can set the client to perform a task such as beep, place a block above you, disconnect, etc.  This prevented risking getting murdered while afk breaking DRO vaults during early AM.  This also comes in handy if you're raiding somebody's city and you can disconnect the millisecond somebody appears so they often don't see but a blip of you on the radar and might not notice if there's no snitches in the area.  Great for grinders too.  Another feature we have is called LastSeenXYZ where if anybody logs within your radar, a white box is painted with their name in orange so you can easily build a vault around them if you wish.  Also, orbfuscator isn't perfect and to find diamond veins, we can dig tunnels farther apart because at this moment in time, diamonds will appear 1 block beyond where you mined which makes it pointless to do anything less than 4x4 tunnels through a vein or searching for one.  Next up, if you put your vaults in a single layer of IRO or DRO, we can easily find and break them no matter where they are because they show up like a sore thumb via Xray.  The only way to truly hide something is to surround it with at least 3 blocks on all sides for orbfuscator to work.  Last map, orbfuscator was disabled for a short time by mistake and it benefited us greatly.  A suggestion to anybody here is if you come across somebody who is using PVP style mods that you should never try to engage them unless you're lucky enough to see where they log and build a vault around them because you will die.  Other features include a variation of autotool such as autopotion or fastfood when your health or hunger reaches a certain point so human error is less. If you're being chased and see them stop, KEEP RUNNING.  They are likely using stop/speed.  CTcheck does an update every couple seconds of the /ct command when we combat tag and we can set it up for disconnectsafe if CT expires when things aren't going well we won't waste a second and log.  With our client, it is very hard to tell if somebody is legit or cheating unless they're just standing still or being a total noob.  I'm sure many other people have discovered the same things here, but as of now I think this version of MC will be the last for a while because our coder ended up quitting a while back.  By the way, none of us have ever gotten banned from civcraft.  After things are obsolete and we all get bored, we may release the client after several new iterations of MC are released for people to try.  I hope this helps level the field for everybody as I'm pretty much getting a bit bored of civ and will probably take a break from it for a while.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_1fk02u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1fk02u/i_play_civcraft_and_i_cheat_and_never_been_caught/,

If I had to take a guess I would say its probably involving a prison pearl since those just recently moved to NBT tags instead of  simply using an item ID hack, purely aesthetic change really but it seems to be predictably causing problems down the line. 

It could also be an anvil named item, since NBT tags are AFIK lore data.


Regardless please help out to get us a patch for this issue when you can, also when the server does come back up you will probably have lost significant progress as it was not saved out to the disk during the crash. 

Just as I fix the out of memory error too, oh well, out of the frying pan and into the fire. 


Edit: Erocs thinks its a corrupt chunk, filed a bug report with spigot to see what they suggest, its possible we could load a backup from this morning but if the chunk was corrupted before then it could simply be encountered again and repeat itself. Ideally we will get a fix in spigot or some such to correct the corruption but I doubt that would be quick. 


Edit2: We think we have found a script to correct the corruption, we are going to give it a try, waiting on the backups to finish first just in case trying to correct it goes wrong. Worse case we try loading from this morning's backup about 5 hours ago. 


Edit3: We have the script working, its eta seems to be 5 hours or so, maybe less maybe more, since its possible it will save 4 hours of effort and then save this from happening again (which is hours more) I think its worth running all the way to the end.

Certain factors, like death and reproduction, have proven difficult to apply, but for the most part, anything that can be simulated has been simulated, at least mildly. One civilization-creating force has been largely ignored in CivCraft: Culture.

-

Culture (encompassing architecture, race, language, and random day-to-day practices) has had a massive impact on human civilization. Most of the nations of the world are united not as a political unit, but as a cultural one. What ties Frenchmen together is not the government seated in Paris, but the common ancestry, the common language, the common business practices, the common *culture* of France. Empires have been built on common culture as much as they have collapsed due to opposing internal cultures. Even economics is heavily affected by culture, which drives trends and promotes cooperation between people of a similar background and values. Yet, despite the obvious massive impact on human organizations, we've done little to experiment with the effects of culture on the creating of civilization.

-

Implementing something as complex as culture into Minecraft is no simple task. Certain facets of culture simply cannot be reasonably tested, such as language barriers or racial divides. Even geographic proximity and estrangement is difficult to attempt due to the Nether, and the problem is only exacerbated by the super-efficient (Kudos Road Crew and Rail Crew!) roads and rails of CivCraft. One can get from one location to almost any other in a matter of minutes, and tow thousands of items along with, making localized resources barely relevant. Even on the ""large biomes"" setting, any resource is only a few minutes away.

-

So what can we do?

1) Make travel difficult. People naturally align themselves with those they identify with. When travel is difficult, players will have to tolerate their neighbors, and will begin to identify with the individuals in their region instead of foreigners, a crucial component of culture. This can be accomplished by removing the Nether (Which sounds to be almost guaranteed in CivCraft 2.0) and creating rough terrain with bedrock foundations, as seen in recent CivTests. This will prevent straight-shot roads that, on Swiftness II potions, act like bullet trains. It's difficult to rapidly scale a tall, steep mountain on foot, and also saps food, which will be a much more precious resource in the next iteration. Rails could help scale mountains and cross plains, but will require very significant investment to create and protect.

2) Create an incentive to use local materials instead of importing foreign goods. When certain resources are simply unavailable, people use alternatives to achieve the same ends. Varying culinary practices are a perfect example of this, as are architectural patterns. This can be accomplished by creating massive biomes, as roughly demonstrated in this broad map-type proposal [here](http://i.imgur.com/vgUBm3o.png), where different colors represent different biomes. Terrain height and subterranean composition will still vary throughout the world without regard to biome, as will water supplies. Essentially, biomes are large enough to be one or two of a kind, and span massive swaths of land. In order to obtain sand, a player might have to trek across the wilderness or import with a high expense for distance traveled. Melons might be rare in one area but plentiful in a region where they can be grown. Wood types, too would vary in rarity depending on location. Hopefully this would lead to architecture being identifiably different depending on location. While one town may be predominantly made of oak wood and stone, another might be largely birch and sandstone, creating a sense of community uniformity. Construction using imported materials might distinguish wealth or alternatively cause a structure to be a local target of grief. Players accustomed to having plentiful food supplies might be shocked to live in a community where food must be imported and is therefore treasured. Different environmental conditions could determine how a locale treats farms and factories, whether collectivized or privatized.

3) Nerf players' carrying capacity. This ties in to #2 in helping to limit the widespread flow of foreign products. High-value, low-volume trades like enchanted weaponry or rare ores would be unaffected, but players wishing to carry dozens of stacks of stone would find difficulty. Currently, carrying enough blocks to craft a good-sized house is a simple feat, and transporting massive quantities of goods is really not too much of a difficulty. Reducing stack size or inventory size, or causing a player to slow down when carrying too much could help greatly in creating travel costs, giving an advantage to local, plentiful materials. Firms might compete locally for sales in ""closed-circuit"" region-wide economies instead of competing on a global market, giving a huge depth to server economics. Also, railroads allowing chest carts could be a useful investment for two cities wishing to increase trade flow with one another. Transportation cost would become an important part of an item's price calculation instead of a mostly ignored, very cheap expense.

While CivCraft can certainly manage without it, culture adds a whole new level of complexity to our simulation, increasing the legitimacy of our findings, which I think we all strive to do. Limiting transportation of both players and resources is just the first step in developing region-specific cultures. Like-minded players would want to live in cities whose architecture and traditions they enjoy, making actual communities based on factors other than political ideology or economic philosophy. CivCraft 2.0 is the perfect opportunity to add the important element of culture to our simulation.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_1db4cu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1db4cu/culture_the_massive_ingredient_civcraft_10_lacked/,

1359843026.0,77,self.Civcraft,17rvp4,Cheating Policy 3D,87,10,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17rvp4/cheating_policy_3d/,"**The Setting**

Civcraft is an irradiated wasteland. Within it lie cities. Outside the world border, a wasteland: The Cursed Earth. Inside the walls: the cursed cities, stretching from Columbia to Atlantis. An unbroken voxel landscape. Thousands of people living in the ruin of the old world and the mega-structures of the new one. Mega-blocks, nether highways, mega-cities.  Convulsing, choking, breaking under their own weight. Citizens in fear of the x-ray, the aimbot, the forcefield. Only one thing fighting for order in the chaos: The men and women of the admin team. Juries... Executioners... Judges.

Dramatic? Yes, but how would I adapt Dredd quotes otherwise?

I am the law. I am Chief Justice Dredd, the new face of anti-cheating justice. I am many, and I am one.

**The Question**

Due process in a video game?  Justice in the meatspace is a hard enough proposition. What would possess a group to attempt to apply that principle, in all of its difficult and conflict-inspiring nature, to a video game? What madness would inspire a group of visionaries to attempt it in a game so vulnerable to exploitation and sparse with evidence that the concept of ‘proof’ soon becomes laughable?

Or maybe the larger question - why make Civcraft at all? Why invest so much time and so much effort into something when it is not even up to you if it turns into an incredible utopia or a heaping pile of miserable slag?  Would not the sure investment be better? Time spent creating maybe a game as a work of art as opposed to a game as an experiment, where the outcome could simply be appreciated for what it was and the game would simply be *produced* from start to finish by its creators, instead of coming to life and enslaving them. Why deal with all of the vapid commentators who think a basic grasp of the English language gives them some obligation to ridicule that effort and success which they could not match?

*Why?*                                                        

Because the idea is to make a game that not only truly respected its players intelligence, but reacted to it, was shaped by it, and existed in a class of its own as a game with goals so much larger and more complex than simply being appreciated as a work of art. The goal is, in a way, to pay tribute to the awe-inspiring complexity and ability of the human mind and the universe in which it resides by pulling it into perspective - by *placing the universe in a box* and playing a *game* with it.

That said, the way we’ve done things in the past has not worked. Putting demanding civil procedure into a game administered by unpaid staffers just isn’t tenable. While it would be nice to have court opinions that explain every bit of reasoning in detail, that’s just not going to happen for every case. “Beyond reasonable doubt” is a great standard of proof for the real world where lives are at stake, but the worst that happens here is that you have to go play on another server. If we continued to try to implement such a stringent standard of proof here, most cheaters would go unpunished.

This presents a serious problem.  Most games deal with this by adopting a “ban first, never ask questions” mentality among the game masters, but also none of those games have to deal with Minecraft. There’s so much ambiguity in cases of alleged cheating because *the game Notch designed doesn’t work* that, in order to succeed, we must strike a careful balance between shotgun banhammering and total non-enforcement. To maintain the integrity of the gameplay experience, *we are going to have to ban more people than we have in the past*. Some people are not going to be happy. That’s unfortunate, but if you don’t like it, code us a new game.

Changes will have to be made.

**The Process**

Cheating inquiries are going to be significantly more private than they have been. This is not the People’s Court. You’ve never played a game with transparent moderation before, and as it turns out that’s probably because it’s virtually impossible. That said, things will still be more transparent here than anything else you’ve ever played. We’re keeping the method of introducing accusations. It provides a framework for people to compile information both for and against alleged cheaters, and makes the Judge’s job easier. Much of the proceeding, however, will take place in messages between the Judge, the defendant, and the accusers. This is necessary in order to get more detailed information. Judges are also encouraged to make other inquiries and gather additional material on their own.

The purpose of cheating inquiries is *not* the procedure itself. This is not a venue in which someone’s failure to get a warrant will get you out of jail even though everyone knows you’re guilty. The point is to find truth, and to remove cheaters. This means that anyone can bring forth information, and anyone can make a case. The process will be as flexible as we need to make it, and some things may change on the fly as needed.

We want this to be fair. We never want to ban someone who wasn’t cheating. The simple reality is, however, that if we’re going to ban *anyone*, we very well may get a legit player or two in there as well. “Statistical impossibility” is far too high a burden of proof. If a few decent players end up playing on a different server in order that we may get rid of those actually x-raying, etc., then that’s how it must be. I’ll note here that this is only okay because the server is not public property, and the consequences of a ban are not actually damaging. We can get away with a lot more than a real world justice system, because we’re not talking about matters of life and death.

**The Standard of Proof**

The new standard of proof is more-or-less “[by clear and convincing evidence]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Clear_and_convincing_evidence).” This strikes as close a balance as I think we can get between chaos (*anarchy!*) and administrative authoritarianism that would run counter to the ethos of Civcraft. While this may seem like a shift (and compared to a few decisions by Orthzar, it is), this seems to be the standard by which many cases of the past were judged. For a bit further clarification on what this will actually mean for Civcraft, refer to the forthcoming case decisions (probably today or tomorrow).

As for evidenciary standards, we’ll take just about anything, but it will be weighed according to its probative value. “Hearsay” is acceptable, though it will merely be used for corroboration and will be subject to inquiry. Evidence of hacking (or alts) on other servers may also be used as corroborating evidence. As in the meatspace, the Judge will determine what is admissible.


**Reserved rights**

We reserve the right to change process at any time. What we will *not* do, however, is impose new procedural process in the time between when the case is argued and when a decision is made. People should have some idea of the standard by which they are judged.

We reserve the right to go back and look at previous cases. This will not be common, but if there’s a decision that we later realize is wrong, we’re going to fix it. Again - truth, not process, is the goal. Process is just how we get there.

If you are a rude prick to the Judge or administrators during your inquiry, we reserve the right to enter that as a guilty plea and punish you accordingly. Just keep that in mind, and be polite to your Judge. Maybe “rude prick” is your playstyle. Maybe “bans rude pricks” is my playstyle. Respect it.

We reserve the right to hear any appeals that may be put forth, or to not hear them.

We reserve the right to keep from the general public evidence of certain methods of hacking or cheating that we do not wish to become public. The person banned will know why they were banned, but if the method by which they cheated is determined to be something that we don't wish to be widely known, then that information will not be released and any attempt by that person to release the information to spite us will result in a ban from the subreddit.

We reserve the right to answer your question with a simple “no.”

**Conclusion**

We continue to hope that we can provide the best gaming experience you’ve ever had. We have something truly unique here – truly beautiful. People get emotionally involved in Civcraft in a way that rivals or exceeds what happens in other MMOs that have massive budgets, lots of staff, and base games that *aren’t* a series of kludges piled on other kludges. Don’t freak out about this. It’s not going to change much. It will, I hope, demonstrate that we are serious about eliminating as much cheating as possible from Civcraft. We want a level playing field.

The cheating policy in the sidebar will be undergoing some changes in the next few days as well to reflect what is written in this post.

Thank you for reading, and I hope that this post can impart some faith that we really do want to provide a good experience for all of our players by eliminating cheating.

Let me explain the sociopolitical situation on the server before your arrival. 

The vast majority of wealth and power was in the hands of the CKC (those you falsely call the 'ancaps' who are, in fact, a minority. the CKC tends to be united by its belief in the NAP, however). This, in turn, meant that they were the most well-equipped, most organised and most powerful group on the server. They had a monopoly on force, as they were able to defend their property using their superior PVP skills and armour violently in a way that ensured any disagreements with that definition of property were disregarded. At the end of the day, my own disagreement with the right-wing conception of private property was irrelevant, because if I were to act upon it, I would be pearled as I am not adequately skilled or equipped to reinforce my actions. My political disagreements with the CKC are well-known. Your analysis of the server up to this point was correct, to a certain extent. 

However, the understanding of political power and where it lay on the server you had when you joined was fundamentally flawed. The fact the CKC is so well-equipped has never been any restriction on the ability of new players to obtain equal amounts of wealth, it's just that nobody has ever organised in a way (prior to your arrival) that would give them similar wealth. So their stranglehold on political power may have been present, yes, but not to the point of immovable hegemony because at the end of the day they never had a monopoly on **all the server's resources**. 

Your 'ancaps' may have been the richest and most actively powerful players on the server, but the laissez-faire nature of their beliefs meant that they would never turn up in a random city, grief structures and start murdering innocent people. They never represented a dominant or dictatorial regime to the point of blind genocide, like you. For all their shortcomings, they played the game as it was meant to be played.

Your first point of attack was, tragically, Mt. Augusta, due to the ill-informed belief that it was the ancaps' favourite city. Mt. Augusta has always been a great place for new players to start, and as far as I'm aware, actual 'ancaps' have never even lived there in numbers larger than 1 or 2. You have attacked and pearled players relentlessly from every single different group in the server. You have remorselessly destroyed the cities and settlements that aren't in any way associated with a belief in capitalism or anarchism. Your justification for your bloodlust is nothing but a mere smokescreen, aiming to build on the fears and common grievances of the servers' population. I can't even walk through the nether roads anymore without being attacked. The way you pearl players is uncoordinated, unbiased and completely arbitrary. The fact is you don't care about what group we belong to, you don't care what city you're in and you don't care about ending the old regime. You only care about ruining a great game for hundreds of people. 

So as the CKC wither away, as the rest of the server runs into hiding or quits, and as the cities and settlements we have spent weeks and months on are systematically destroyed, you, the HCF, will emerge the victors of a vacuous war on community, on socialisation, and on time and effort. Amidst the smoke and the ashes, you will stand alone; your tin crown will gleam in the half-light of the setting sun, with no lives left to ruin, with no cities left to burn. The sun will fall over the crest of the horizon before you press the log-out button, one last time. The server, no longer anything but a fallen symbol of the abortive sorrows, the shortwinded elations and the crushed hopes and dreams of Man, will be no more. Enjoy your victory.

i cant even log onto the server without my blood pressure rising nowadays. i cant fathom the stupidity of most of the kids on here. ill call you kids because your actions dont merit you being called adults in any way at all. you sit around all day trying to pick fights with people who dont want them. you create messes and destroy the work of people because in some way you think its funny. you shit on other people, even your friends because either you dont care or you get something for yourself out of it. you lack respect for anyone that cant match you in pvp because youre caught up in some ridiculous superiority complex. youve become the people you used to dislike most on the server. you cant take the two seconds it takes to pull your head out of your ass to see that the people of the smaller towns you shit on constantly are trying to get by the same way you did when you had just started your own towns way back when (or for many of you just four or five months ago). 

since when was this server filled with the most apathetic sorts? when a town is massacred for the crime of ""whatever the hell weak excuse i can come up with but who really cares anyways"" im sickened. but what can most of us do? the people doing this are either:

- the ones who would normally stop this from happening

- protected by those ones for whatever reason

- powerful but the people with power to stop it are too busy doing so themselves elsewhere.

its sad really, i know many of you had once been good on the server. had actually gone out of your way to help people. hell even spent *two whole months** trying to save people. then the next thing you know the guns not pointed at the enemy (even debateably so called the enemy because many of those guys are more decent than you) but at the people you once fought to defend. and you try to lie and pay your way out of it. not even man enough to admit you messed up because you truly believe you didnt. but you did, you never had a higher purpose behind the thievery and murders. you had no noble cause, just the need to sate some hunger for adrenaline, fulfill a personal vendetta, or to just do it for the lulz (god i hate that phrase). and now you just run around like nothing ever happened, having just received a slap on the wrist or even garnering a little bit of personal gain from the whole ordeal. and now you pearl people for the most insignificant, baseless, or irrelevant of crimes and then exact your own for of justice with a side of ""i dont really care ill just leave him in my vault forever"" and thats that (see jacks who even if they did help out the HCF, which still hasnt been shown to the public, its not really your place to say they couldnt or to terrorize them repeatedly after you had already done so before you even knew about it. and thats *only* one example) if ever the time a word such as *hypocrite* was to be thrown around, now would be the time. 

oh and i almost forgot to mention that some of you even act like you can still act like model citizens, well you can fucking forget about that for some time because you sure as hell dont deserve to think of yourselves in that manner. not for a good amount of time.

[insert stepping outside for a 27]

ok now on the matter of rampant stupidity. rampant stupidity in the way people talk especially. every time i see ""muh lel rekd gg grimp nigger(seriously fuck anyone who uses that one) jimmies fgt #true"" i honestly die a little bit on the inside, after i lose all (remaining) respect for the one who used it. you know what? i dont even care to elaborate further on this issue aside from saying that its pathetic that you think its funny or cool or whatever you think it may be. its really pathetic.

now to issues concerning myself. why dont i do anything about what i have said up there? simply because i dont have the time or the skill to pearl the lot of them. being close friends with eagles has put me in a predicament, having known about the gimmick brigade and most (sans two) of its members identities throughout the whole ordeal and despising it the entire time. i never wanted a fight or to be involved, but around him ive been dragged into the HCF war (a bloody stupid and unnecessary war caused by a witch hunt), the gimmick brigade matters, and now this fucking bullshit which seems to have become the norm. and it shouldnt have ever become what im supposed to do, because none of this should have happened in the first place anyways.

i also wish to declare the works a failure. it has been for a while, but now i feel it has truly become so.
when i founded it with shortman back in october (october 20, 2012 to be exact), it was to be the second coming of all that was good about atmora. it soon didnt become that and instead became the personal project of me and eaglesrock. eventually it became a dual leadership until we would have had a meeting of all members to decide on a government (never happened). we instead decided to focus on making a beautiful peaceful city, to be home to growth and factories and all sorts of goodness, open to only the best of people. and it was great, we picked up some good people such as mateyHD, lat3nt, spanone and others. it was to be that until around december when eagles started to focus on the HCF fight, leaving me to look after the city while he was out *fighting the good fight*. the settlement almost died from sheer neglect at the time as it was basically just me building on the superfortress the entire time (i wanted no part in the war). towards the second half of the war things started coming back to the works but not in the good way. basically people started to come here because the works had become a place for supply storage almost had a vault for the war. little more than what used to be a pretty town and a war base. after the war i took a week long hiatus and after a day of being back an entirely new district had been started with all new citizens (unprecedented as before we had thoroughly discussed any new builds or new members, this just happened completely without my knowledge so i was a bit pissed from the getgo). it wasnt just that but that the new citizens had no respect for anything the works stood for, and because they didnt neither did eagles. sure, the city was active for a while, but just like i said many times before: they wouldnt be long term citizens (hell i dont even think they called themselves citizens, they never cared for the works as much as the rest of us did, to them it was just another property they could own). they ended up using their property as storage, some plots dont have anything on them but half a house and rows of chests full of who knows what. meanwhile im being thrown under the bus: im told flatout that i have no power in the works anymore and that im no longer a leader, im not even given mod power in the mumble channel (and in the new one that i made i have been *stripped* of mod power in all but the private channel*, i had to even pester the shit out of people to even get access to the new portal. im pushed out of all groups because anytime i would tell eagles about some far fetched plan or let him on to any secret he would go and tell everyone in batcave about it even if i would say not to tell people. this is after keeping my own damn mouth shut on multiple occasions ESPECIALLY during the HCF and gimmick events. 

anyways, im leaving the works, it lost its magic a while ago, i lost any respect there when shitheads (sorry not sorry) moved in, and i dont agree with what actions it and its most active citizens make (whats left of them). it never became what it was meant to be, now its just half built houses, burned down wooden ones, and empty plots. im sure you must have noticed my departure was imminent by now as ive torn down most of what ive built: the cathedral, the dhingus and co lofts, the old town center, much of the superfortress, the old portal, and my house. basically half of the original city no longer exists. why? because i dont want it to be there anymore. i dont want to walk back there and be tempted to pick up where i left off because it can never be what it could have been. i leave my leadership position (yeah i know i dont have it shitlord but i never said i left so i still had it, you can suck a big one if you disagree) and give eaglesrock full power over whats left. im going to retain my ownership rights on all of my land in the works because apparently i dont have to be a citizen to have that.

i dont want to sound too smiteful, eagles, youre still one of the best friends ive ever had and still am, but youre kind of a doucher *in civcraft* sometimes. 

and to the rest of you, fuck off or at least take a step back to realize how much of an asshole you have become. civcraft need a few more good men (and women), not some more childish asshats. 

and, as always, keep your stupid trolly inside joke bullshit outta my thread.

goodnight, ill see you when the dolan emirates go public or i come out of my corner of the world to build more roads for people.

edit: who am i kidding, insomnia's not gonna let me sleep tonight

Like all of you, I started a quest to be ""good"" at Civcraft when I joined the server. After months of research, I have finally put together a comprehensive guide. This involves the 3 basic rules,

* cheat
* lie
* walk free

Step 1: **Cheat**

Yes, we all know X-Ray and Nodus are completely illigal in most servers. But CivCraft? No way! Just because some players say it's wrong, and maybe some admins, with the rest of this plan you'll be walking free in no time.

Make sure to use X-Ray as blatantly obvious as possible, as it's more efficient! Also, make sure to set off any snitches in the immediate area. Even if players have proof of you being there, and evidence of blatant xray usage, the admins won't do anything anyways! Wonderful!

Step 2: **Lie**

Ah yes, my favorite step.  If some peasant non-nodus user compiles a thread about you ""cheating"" with your 100% legal and legit mods, all you have to do is...you guessed it...LIE! It's simple, twist the story so it's in your favor. Even with no proof, Admins would LOVE to take your story as 100% truth! Isn't that great? 

Examples: ""I just fell through the roof and landed accidentally on his vault"", or ""I followed a cow and he led me directly to his underground base""

Step 3: **Walk Free**

If you did the last two steps correctly, the Admins should not do anything! (not like they do anyways) You're a free man, and will walk free once again!

With these steps, you should be able to be at the top of the CivCraft food chain in no time! ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1358108199.0,,,True,t3_16i8pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16i8pa/dtrolls_comprehensive_guide_to_being_good_at/,

The server was on the brink of choas, about to be overrun by griefers that simply could not be restricted to one location, PrisonBeds had proven totally ineffective. But did we ban those who escaped the prisons? No, we out engineered them, with a lot of work and a stroke of genius PrisonPearl was born.

Citadel has a similar, if less dramatic story, starting with a need to limit theft and destruction in Chxville. 

What makes Civcraft great is that when we are presented with the choice between chaos and authoritarianism we chose neither, we build door number 3. When you find a problem in your experimental methodology you do not fudge your results and interfere with the experiment until it produces what you expect, you design a better experiment. 

With that in mind, lets focus on the flaw, capital investment, or more specifically lack of it. No amount of skill with the scythe can overcome the capital investment of a automated harvesting combine. But in a world where no tool but the scythe can be created it is numbers and skill alone that win. 

With that in mind, how do we extend Minecraft tech tree with only the tools available to us?

On most new city posts I see down vote brigades and people saying they shouldn't do it. They say there are already established cities they should join. I personally think that before the reset this was a valid point, but right now there will be many new cities that start up and most will probably fail quickly. Then the people from those cities will join the remaining ones. If the cities you suggested are indeed the best then they will survive and grow. If not then they won't.

Why discourage people from trying to make their city just because you dont consider it one of the legitimate cities, all the major cities started out small once and this server will probably be a mix of the main cities form the old server rebuilt and some new ones. In my opinion right now lots of cities trying to become world powers is a good thing for players and good for the Civcraft experiment, Most will fail and only the strong survive. 

My warning is...

- Don't just assume the world powers are set because certain members of those cities say so. 
- Don't attempt to work out which cities are legitimate and will be world powers on reddit before the map is even up. 
- Let the experiment take place in game on the server, i was under the impression that's what Civcraft was about.
- Remember that all the world powers on the last server started somewhere and whatever city you lived in was once just an idea in the head of someone just like the people you are now discouraging. (edited in because i though of it later)

Edit, also I fully expect to just be down voted by the same people who down vote all the new city posts, but I feel like a reasonable debate is a better option... Then when both sides arguments are made in a reasonable fashion people may decide which view point they agree with on their own.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1368588487.0,,,True,t3_1ecri8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1ecri8/why_discourage_experimentation/,

You're far more pathetic and pitiful than any of them.

*Foreword - Yes my post is almost a direct contradiction to the content, please extract comedic value from it and/or bolster your own sense of superiority.*

HCF is here to ruin everyone's fun.  Don't look any further into the motives -- it's simply what these kind of communities do to entertain themselves.  I used to play on a ""hardcore"" PVP server that would raid other, non-PVP-focused servers for the lulz, perhaps engaging in some politics just to string the naive players along even more.  That's what happening.  Your constant tear-filled tirades only fuel the fires more.  Don't get pearled, log out when you see an unknown entity on your radar.  If you do get pearled, don't come onto the subreddit to post a long rant about how these children must be 13 and have no lives or whatever because that's just making your situation worse as it entrenches their ""ideology.""  I'm sure they're getting their jollies with the incredible response on the subreddit from their actions.


Hell, I'm kind of fanning the flames myself with this post.  But seriously, either discuss the particulars of your pearling and try to avoid discussions about motivations or how horrible of people they must be.  It's a video game - especially to them.  They don't care about you and your feelings, and they especially don't care about experimenting with evaluating the benefits of various governance styles and economies.  In fact, *if they can hurt your feelings by altering a few bytes on a server somewhere, then you are giving them far more power than they already have.  This is why they are flooding this server - the nature of the experiment invites huge amounts of drama and strained emotions as this is more than just a video game for many of the regular players.*  It's basically a candy store for anyone who wants to get off on griefing - you can essentially permaban anyone by winning at PVP.  It's like logging onto a creative server that has no block protection or whitelist.


I've been here from the very first week of the server, and in many ways I welcome this change.  It is certainly causing a reevaluation of the Civcraft experiment -- a failed experiment is NOT a failure!  I am interested to see how it all ends.  If I'm permanently sentenced in the end, if my town is burned to the ground or buried in cobble, I'll just go play my guitar or something instead of validating their entire motivations to create chaos.  I've already gotten an incredibly rich, fulfilling experience from this server and its wonderful history.


Perhaps use this experience to evaluate morality, history, and legacy -- don't cry about how you lost 100 hours of your life because your stupid virtual tower is now buried in a cobble mountain and your chests full of diamonds are compromised.  That's not really what this server is about.

Straight from the mouth of the ""Ancap/World Police"", I bring you a message of hope, rather than negativity (like so many other recent posts).

Most people probably know that Augusta got covered in cobble over christmas, on a scale previously unseen before on our server. Today, the portal has been cleared and the Sami Ghani memorial once more stands proudly clear of garbage. These tactics are less the actions of conquerors, and more that of weakened griefers. Once the war is over, we will clear the entire city of cobble (I plan on personally handing out free diamond picks), cook it into stone, and use that stone to continue making Augusta a safer place to live.

**We're still getting their pearls, one at a time** (we've pearled at least 6 of them today already). None of them have, or will, get broken out successfully. We pearl more of them every day.

1364420878.0,78,self.Civcraft,1b4xxm,Don't break out the Champagne but I think the worse may be behind us. ,84,6,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1b4xxm/dont_break_out_the_champagne_but_i_think_the/,"As of a few hours ago I used recently collected funds to buy a [Javapipe VPS](http://javapipe.com/web/), within a few minutes I had our new mumble setup, within a few more our friend had leveled the same firepower that had leveled Dreamhost at our new VM. 

No one really noticed, in fact it would have been impossible for me to know if Javapipe tech support had not emailed me asking if it was us performing a test. 

So for the time being Civcraft is [bulletproof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk8eJh4i8Lo), I am working with Hexapus to get the data off of Titan for movement onto the new server. All in all it would not be unreasonable to have Civcraft fully online by tonight or early tomorrow. I also hope to get untamedears.com fowarded to the new IP.

So that's the good news, now for the bad news, $367 pays for 5Gbps of DDOS midigation, 8 gigs of ram, and two 2.4ghz cores. Fortunately the hard disk is an SSD, by my guesstimation this machine should be able to host 75-100 players top. Although I may be able to get out some more by pulling some tricks. 

Back to the good news, this is a stopgap measure, with one month of hosting at Javapipe we should have time to get our hosting situation figured out and move our actual server hardware (Titan) to a colo that can handle this sort of attack and hopefully be a long term solution. Dreamhost was simply not setup to handle DDOS's ideally our colo will sell mitigation which we will not have to use most of the time and only buy when we need it. 

As a little bit of bad news, connecting to the server can be a little weird as it is both in Romania and the DDOS mitigation sometimes messes with legit traffic just a little, if you already have a connection open you are fine but sometimes opening up new ones can be a little wonky. Just keep trying at a not bot like pace. 

For some final notes I just have to say that the people at Javapipe have been pretty dam awesome so far and it may be possible to exchange some of that midigation for better specs on the VM as the DDOS protection has 'burst' capacity that is 3 times what you buy, so 15Gbps for us right now. Since it seems our attacker never likes to keep up a prolonged assault we could probably get away with 2Gbps protection and the burst protection would cover up to the highest his attacks have reached (4Gbps). Also there is a Minecraft server running at the address of the new server right now, but its not Civcraft, just me playing around. When Civcraft comes back up it should be like nothing at all happened.

Along side such fashionable fads as ""Why our Glorious Leader is perfect"", the ""I Quit!"" fad has gained plenty of traction among the average worker. The fad itself involves a lengthy proclamation stating why they quit and how the they want the ""Old Civcraft back"". These threads has gained further popularity due to recent high profile celebrities openly complaining about how the game of life no longer benefits them. The recent fad has been declared illegal in Buenos Aires due to its distracting nature. 




""We are liberating the people from the cities!"", that was a recent declaration made by our glorious comrades of the Reformed HCF. No longer are the HCF some group of misfits with no ideological purpose rather, they are misfits with an ideological purpose. Our Glorious Leader questioned the judgement of such a statement but explains, ""I'm not a farmer but if they want all the workers to flee the city to a life of communal farming, I'm ok with this"". The recent security operations by the Reformed members of the HCF have remained largely successful as plenty of Ancap terrorists were rooted out from the ruins of Augusta. In other news, it turns out Tigerstaden doesn't even exist! The recent revelation became obvious as buildings within the city began to fall due to a strong gust of wind. Most of the buildings turned out to be elaborate cardboard cut outs set up by Ancap terrorists in order to stage their false flag operation. 




Finally, as 90% of the World falls into disorder and chaos, the Democratic People's Republic of Buenos Aires remains strong. The city of Leningrad also remains in reasonable conditions despite a recent series of thunderstorms and earthquakes. The streets of Buenos Aires remains lively while the theater begins to take its final form as workers continue around the clock to complete this national treasure! The project of de-desertification has continued leaving large chunks of desert nothing but massive smoothstone pits while the charcoal jungle has been stripped of much of its former beauty. All such environmental damages are a true sign of progress for the Leninist state.

But it's a game I've chosen to invest a lot time in and shitfucks like the HCF, captain_Sully, drizzlethe3, rkawesome and all you other ""lel i totly le kild yu xDxDxD"" idiots in the end have just shit on everything. You are fucking terrible human beings. Seriously. You're a waste of the air I breathe.

I'm done giving a fuck. I'm done having this added stress in my life. I'm done with this server taking my time away from my family. I played this to de-stress from work and the worries of RL. It's not fucking working any more because you are all a bunch of pieces of shit.

To the mods: FUCK YOU. Y_Ankees was CLEARLY using x-ray. He even said, ""I dug where I did because I thought it was a vault room."" If he really thought it was a vault room, after the 2nd layer he would have moved closer in. He didn't because he was fucking x-raying. Get your shit together.

To TTK: FUCK YOU TOO. Sure, it's an *experiment*. But everyone with a fucking brain is leaving. Soon, your server will be nothing but the HCF dickshits and morons who think they can change things. Nothing will fucking change. The HCF will stay here. Everyone will make a move to the end or be forced there by those assholes. Then people will make a go of civilizing the end, which will work for a week and then HCF will come shit on everything up there. If you don't exercise your rights as owner of this server and ban these HCF fuckers, you will lose this server. People will leave. Maybe that's the best thing for you. I know this shit can be really stressful for you.

To Eion, Ancient_Amateur, Pansyman8, CricketPinata, NoTrueScotsman, DuckmanDrake, DiamondReaper, Axspringer, lem0n, and a shit load of other people who know who they are and who I'm not going to take the time to list: You guys are fucking awesome. Thanks for some fucking fantastic times in gaming. Get the fuck out now because this shit will start to consume you.

Now that I've had a moment to cool off while writing this: Mods &amp; TTK, I know you guys are trying to do the best you can. I wrote ""FUCK YOU"" out of anger and I'm not going to change it because it suited the moment. But you guys really need to think about what's best for the server, not the experiment. You've lost a lot of the great old players like Matticus, Foofed (fuck you though Foofed), rdhayes, and everyone else who's made a thread about leaving in the last few weeks. These were people who invested countless hours in making this server wonderful. It's not wonderful anymore. It's a steaming pile of shit that a cow ate and vomited back up. Save your server and get rid of HCF.

That's the word describing the recent atrocity at Fort Arrack after it was attacked by a group of HCF savages. The People's News Today has been given a confirmed unverified report that among the attacking HCF members, included comrade Y_ankees, Spurion, Gordge, Livided, and toontasker. Furthermore, a list of atrocities was given with that unverified confirmed report in which HCF members were involved in the consumption of human flesh, Zoophile activity with all domesticated animals, placing severed heads into a pyramid, and other activities considered too graphic to explain for a PG rated newspaper. When asked about his implication in the massacre, comrade Spurion answered, ""I need to give a quote for the People's News Today?"". The massacre of all the innocent comrades at Fort Arrack has yet to be justified by the savages of the HCF. Perhaps the horror of their own crime cannot even be justified with a response.




As the whole of the Civcraft World continues its frantic rush to bunker down in the event of an HCF attack, the Glorious City of Buenos Aires has made important steps to reform. Through a press conference, the Ideology Minister has declared that he was stepping down from his other role as the Defense Minister. He  explains, ""I've come to realize that perhaps arming workers with Little Red Books may not be the most effective method of combating an army of diamond wielding savages"". In his place, a veteran soldier from the infamous Jackshold assault has taken the Defense Ministry position. Our Glorious Leader's choice reflects an ongoing series of reforms that will bring more stability to an already stable workers paradise.




The Workers Parliament has a new member today! After democratic considerations were made, our Glorious Leader chose comrade Grapeman as the latest member of this small yet vital assembly of important workers. Comrade Grapeman's unique appointment shows a willingness to allow an opposition figure to hold a government position. Many comrades question the fringe nature of his political philosophy with some calling him an anarchist and a traitor to the workers. 



Finally, the experimental anti-traitor equipment on the Leninist statue has been taken down after it was quote, ""Too successful for its own good"".

Complex mods like NoCheat can manage to keep the most obvious cheating at bay (although sometimes not even that) but the fundamental design of Minecraft makes cheating easier than it is in almost any other game. We can hope that 1.3, with its new 'single-player is multi-player' redesign provides some improved protection by preforming more acts server side and trusting the client less. But as it stands we have a lot of time yet before we are over on that side of the hill. 


My policy in the past has always been hesitance in taking action, you must recognize that *any action I take is the greatest possible threat to what we are trying to do with this server* and as such I would much rather let a guilty cheater go free than ban an innocent player. Which brings me to my most interesting point.


Prison Pearl has proved incredibly effective even against cheaters, for many of the players I have recently looking to for cheating they where already in the end and effectively IP banned (and then some) by the alternate account detector. Except in the most extreme cases it seems that Prison Pearl remains an effective system for player administration even when they are not on an even footing. Of course its not fair, and or course its not optimal. Formal accusations of cheating are few and far between, gathering evidence and proving a case is not something I accept a low bar for. But I remain optimistic that this server, despite its size and lack of white list may be better moderated against cheaters by its own players than other servers, even with whitelists, manage with an army of admins.  



I will tinker with and attempt to improve cheating counter measures on my end, but ultimately you can, and have been doing, a better job than any admin ever could.

While that is not great it is an appreciable improvement considering that simply loading a backup would have brought us back 5 hours and then this whole thing would have happened again next time someone encountered one of the 4 broken chunks. 

Anyways, now for the bad news, we tried running the script in place on Achilles (our JavaPipe server) but it only has 4 threads, so our best ETA was about 5 hours. We downloaded the map to a machine with more threads, which got the job done in 1 hour thanks to the wonders of multithreading, but it does not have that great of an upload speed to send the fixed data back to Achilles.  At the end of the day it will probably end up being a wash as to which method would have been faster. 

But the fact remains that while the upload should be done in a few hours at most its going to be pretty close to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1erhrk/scheduled_maintenance_on_our_vm_host_in_about_18/), when we need to shutdown the server for matience to our VM host anyways. 

At that point it may just be better to leave it off overnight and pick back up with tomorrow mornings changelog. 

I am very sorry for the downtime everyone, but it does seem that when it comes to kinks to work out the testing phase of this server, which lasts for the next 5 days, is still very much justified.

Earlier this day, the following conversation happened:

http://i.imgur.com/uedkmwY.png

full Pastebin with the missing part:

http://pastebin.com/ufdeZj2n

I did a bit of research and I don't know where to start, this is ridiculous and I sincerely hope that comped is just an elaborate troll and not the ten-year-old retard that he seems to be. But well, here we go.

-----------------------------------------------

Dear comped.


Yes, what a nice Alliance you have. Totally not a copy of the SEA, because ""the two are not in any way related, besides name"". Then why is [your treaty](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2A49s1RTiUmS05SZUZFcXZoM1U/preview?pli=1)  a direct copy of the SEA one? You even forgot to change the Document name, geez!

It is also nice how you can coexist with non-alliance-members peacefully, and don't treat them like shit, how you boast about nonexistant accomplishments of yours and disregard the fact, that the person you are talking to has spent 10 months of CivCraft 1.0 as a Diplomat. You weren't even here back then, you cunt! You are calling me close minded, and are implying you had the power to influence my people against me.

YOU. KNOW. NOTHING.

You know nothing about how the server works, you know nothing about how Prussia works. You don't even know how your own Alliance works as you needed to copy the treaty from a text, and not just any text, no. I wrote a decent part of that treaty. Just shut up.

You added us to your Alliance on your Treaty and on [the Wiki](https://civcraft.org/doku.php/factions2?rev=1369481565), misleading one of our residents into thinking we actually were a part of that bullshit. You really seem to want us huh? You really need us, is it that? That all other factions in your cute little party of fuckwits are irrelevant to everyone except for themselves?

Well, back to the text.


&gt;You sound like I once was. Nieve and ignorant of those who know me better then I know.

Who are you again? Why did nobody know about you until about a month ago? You know me better than I do? Are you my psych doc? Oh hi Dr. Meienburg, didn't know you play CivCraft.

also, &gt;Nieve

It took your misspelling about thirty seconds to become a meme on the Prussian sub.

&gt;I've done far greater things, yet do you see me boast?

Yes, you do nothing else you goddamn cunt! You have achieved nothing! You are nothing! Deal. With. It. Build yourself up from there instead of talking about how great you are!

&gt;I'm not one for stupidities. You're the idiot in the room.

Did you ever re-read your post history? It is a /r/CivCringe gold mine! You are a fucking moron, you have absolutely no idea what you are even talking about!

&gt;Prussia, without this, will most likely get griefed, or invaded, or something, and wither and die.

Made my day. Do you even know who I am? What I did? How Prussia was created? Why we are like we are? How we even are? Obviously not.

And the absolute gem:

&gt;Consider yourself closed off to Tridentia, Sky City, and P-something.

So, you are now telling me that Prussia just got an embargo for not wanting to join your stupid little group of nobodies? Nice.

&gt;P-something

Must be helluva good Alliance if the leader does not even know all names of member-cities.

**This is my message to you:**

**Take us off the treaty, take us off every other document that there is. Then delete the Treaty and write your own.**

**If you do not comply within 24 hours, I will declare war.**


----------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;/rant&gt;

**TL;DR**

Comped copied the SEA-Treaty and put Prussia on it, wrote a lot of nonsense about how his alliance would be vital for us and threatened me, my position and my Country. If he does not put this down in 24h, I will go all sharp4 up his ass.

**Advice for everyone in the +/+: Do not join the SEAT, it is a sad try of comped to feel important.**

**Sky City and Petrania, I strongly advise you not to deal with comped and to leave the SEAT. He has no idea about how things work and he will cause you more harm than good.**

We will probably want to make some changes after people play on this new map for a while and tell us about problems or mistakes we made. If the changes are large enough, or the mistakes big enough we may have to make another map and use it instead of the one we are putting online Sunday. But it is unlikely to come to that. 

If by the time one week has elapsed (the next Sunday) we have found nothing wrong big enough to require the creation of a new map I will declare the map we put online this coming sunday as final and we will keep it. 

For those of you wondering, world border will be 15km circle. 


tl;dr If nothing goes wrong we keep the map we put up on Sunday

I will address both groups individually. Please refrain from downvote brigading unless someone is overtly trolling. My aim here is to facilitate the release of innocents and those who tried to free them. I have no desire to see griefers and criminals freed. I will probably be saying things and making suggestions people don't like. If I offend anyone, I apologize. I know I'm guilty of a fair amount of shit posting here, but this is an attempt at genuine dialogue and progress. In an effort to bring clarity to the discussion, I use the word ""innocent"" to mean those who did not aggress against the hcf at any point *and* those who only ""aggressed"" in an attempt to free those innocents.

**To HCF:**

Many of your original numbers have quit playing regularly. Those of you who I know still play regularly are Fluffy, Cliff, TFogarty, and swampthing. I'm sure there are quite a few more who's names I'm either forgetting or don't know. I'd like to address those of you willing to actually have a discourse.

In other threads, fluffy has stated that many of us are still held, especially those of us who made attempts on vaults, because of concern that we will re-gear and attack upon release. I understand your concern here and would feel the same way if I had put myself in your position. However, this doesn't address those who are held who have never aggressed against you. Can you provide a reasoning for maintaining their imprisonment?

Further, your group has already demonstrated an impressive ability to rally less active players to the server in times of need, and there is no question that your pvp skills are overall better than the majority of the server. That being the case, could you not just re-pearl those who aggress against you after release?

Finally, what conditions would need to be met in order to secure the release of innocents and those who tried to free them?

DISCLAIMER: Before any request is made by the hcf for names of innocents, please note that we do not know the names of everyone you hold. If you'd like for us to provide the names of innocents, give us the list of everyone that is held.

**To pearled players:**

If granted release, under what conditions would you be willing to refrain from attacking hcf players or their vaults/property?

Do you ask only for release or would you demand material reparations as well?

If you are pearled, please post your ign, reason you were pearled, vault you're held in, whether you ask only for release or would demand reparations, and conditions under which you would not attack hcf players or property.

Ex:
PITBEAST
Lead raid on vaults at 0,0.
World border (-14999, 1, -20).
Release, no reparations requested.
Will not attack hcf if all innocents, including those who only tried to free innocents (with the exception of those who don't agree to non aggression against the hcf), are released.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_181wck,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/181wck/dear_hcf_and_those_pearled_by_them_sincerely/,

Due to an unfortunate situation entirely of my own creation we are working quite hard to take a situation that has forced a map reset and make the best of it by working to improve our next map with what we have learned over the past year of Civcraft's operation. 

We hope to put this new map online this coming Sunday and you are of course more than welcome to join us.

We know this recording was done after the attacks on BSK because I made a reddit post over a month ago showing when fluffy first contacted me.

1) Black Stone Keep had been under attack for a week + at this point

2) Fluffy contacted me regarding BSK being under attack as he was aware or thought he knew who those players were.

3) My conversation with fluffy we even speak about him returning as a legitimate player.

4) When you hear me speak about ""Ancaps/WP"" it refers to the group Gimmick Brigade, as at this time I was not aware of any other name, and we believed most of them involved are well known Ancaps (This is verified at the end when we specifically talk about the recent attacks on BSK by these people)



Enjoy ;)

http://vocaroo.com/i/s06lHnseQy9U


This is being published by me because as I have said all along I have nothing to hide. I'm happy to discuss anything in this recording, the question I would like to know is what about this evidence do they consider to be so secretive that they could not publish it themselves?

I'll tell you...Nothing. They didn't want this published because they knew it would not stand up as evidence against me.

Edit: I'm in BSK mumble if anyone has any questions ;)

To clarify some things as after talking to some people I'm aware how this may shed a bad light on LSIF in general, most people who know me on the server know I don't really care for politics etc, I care about individual people who I consider friends. StriaghtFoolish is one of them and at the time he was the figurehead of the LSIF even if he may not like it most people would turn to him.

So when I speak about LSIF I mainly refer to StriaghtFoolish and what we had discussed, as he and other LSIF members were well aware of what was happening at BSK and wanted to see those people behind it stopped, hence why members of BSK and LSIF spent time together on CivPVP. Arkanjil and others were actively helping defend BSK against the Gimmick Squad and people like servererror so we had strong relationship with them as a group.


Edit: For those doubting that BSK had been attacked this post I made shows when fluffy first contacted me http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1ar12y/hey_world_police_cool_vault_thanks_for_the_stone/c90370i

In this post you can see I was contacted by fluffy 10 days prior to me being pearled, we spoke on mumble together the next day,so 9 days prior to me being pearled me and fluffy spoke.

This is the first post I made regarding BSK you can see March the 5th

http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/19pfzw/space_code_diplicitas_in_lafls_my_town_near_jacks/

---
This server operates on a common law precedent based legal system to resolve disputes with administrators about in game legality of actions. The goal of this post is to summarize the precedent set by various cases as well as possible, in cases where it does not line up with historical precedent perfectly historical precedent comes first and will be what admin actions are based on. In the case that you are ever uncertain about the legality of an action please message modmail. The administrators will be more than happy to tell you and if you request even provide relevant cases. 

----
**Actions defined as cheating**:
--

1. The use of any client side modification to the Minecraft client that changes the data being *sent to* the server from the behavior of the standard client. 

1. The use of a client side modification to gain and act on more information about the server map than possible with the default client. 


---

Players found to be cheating using evidence from the server terminal may appeal their ban with a subreddit post or modmail message.

Players who have evidence of another player is cheating according to the definition above must report such incidents to modmail with accompanying evidence and case support. If the accuser desires they can make their accusation public by making a thread and messaging modmail on the issue. 

----

**Notes on other client modifications**
--

Modifications such as player radar, optifine, way-point systems, texture packs, etcetera do not modify the data the client sends to the server and thus do not fall under the definition of cheating as outlined above. Ideally it would be possible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the use of mods enhancing the display of data sent to the client for things other than the occasionally obvious use of x-ray. Since this is sadly not the case we have chosen to not ban for controversial mods such as player radar on the premise that it is better to do nothing at all than act on shaky evidence. 

--- 

**Case law and precedent** 
--

A list of important cases that set precedent. Any cases denoted as 'Vs Civcraft' are moderator as opposed to player initiated.



* Scylla Vs Civcraft : Actions that are statistically impossible are considered ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" 

* IPartyOnYourDog Vs Civcraft: If for some reason you want to be banned we will skip the formalities and oblige you. 

* RegalCheese Vs Civcraft: Duplication of items using a client mod is considered cheating, possession of duped items or encountering a dupe glitch in the non-modded client is not. 


* Summoner Vs MineCraftIsFTW: [Use of Nodus or possession of other cheating mods is not alone grounds for a ban, but must be combined with evidence of actions meeting the definition of cheating above.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/13wqbd/evidence_of_summoner_cheating/c77uoyy) 



------


Alt-Account policy
------

Civcraft uses a special alternate account detector script to find and prevent the use of alternate accounts to escape pearling. Any account you have ever used to log onto Civcraft is considered your alt and the script may create a chain of associations between accounts detected as your alts and other accounts regardless of other factors. If the script results in a false association as it often will you may be banned without actually having two pearled alts, simply message modmail to resolve the issue, if you wish to nip this in the bud message modmail with all of your alts before playing or generally just before something goes wrong. Otherwise when your account has 2 imprisoned alternate accounts it will no longer be able to log in until at least one of those accounts is freed. 


------

Civcraft administration policy
---

* Civcraft admins exist to create, maintain, and expand game mechanics that allow the creation of player societies in Minecraft this is the source as well as the limit to their authority. 

* In situations where the above directive has been compromised admins may interfere to correct the game world from the flaw in mechanics. The players in question are to present to the subreddit, in the same style as player accusation policy, arguments and evidence that a particular in game action violates the directive and should be corrected. As in accusation policy the other affected party must be notified and given a period of time to defend their actions as legitimate mechanics. 

* Depending on the conclusion of the administration from the presented reasoning changes will be made to resolve the situation to one resembling the outcome of correct mechanics, this is up to the discretion of administrators as to how far compensation and changes are to go based on practical constraints. 

* If there is reasonable evidence to conclude that an in game action violates the directive and has irreversible consequences an individual can make a post filing for an injunction such that the action in question be paused and discussed in the policy outlined in the second bullet, if it is found to be legitimate the situation is to be reversed to its pre injunction state.   

* As in player accusation policy this is an adversarial system, the presiding administrator acts as judge and does not present arguments but instead comes to a conclusion based on those presented by each party, if you wish to contest an argument do not do so with the presiding admin, it will be ignored, instead make all arguments with the opposing party. 

----

**Banned player association** 
-----

Due to the nature of Minecraft Civcraft may often have cases where players are banned for cheating and then proceed to return through evasive use of stolen or new accounts to continue playing with and being supplied by their same in game group. With the goal of properly enforcing cheating rules and make less effective alt evasion to continue cheating on our server we have instituted penalties for players knowingly associating with and supplying banned players. A player who associates with a cheater who has been **previously convicted and banned** in such a way that it is unreasonable to assume they where unaware of the cheaters banned status they will be banned from the server for a short period as a warning. Continued association will result in longer and longer sentences.

You are basically announcing to the server that ""I made a town here are the coords no griefers plz"".

What amounts to a piece of paper will not protect you from those who are not afraid to rob and steal. You either gear up and announce your coords publicly when you can defend yourself or not at all.

**The problem**

What we saw in the independence day massacre was a huge number of deaths due to lax armour laws. 

People might talk about their ""freedom"" to wear enchanted diamond chest mail, hats and shin guards, but if we can save just one pearl, then we need to consider controlling armour.

Do you really need assault armour? really, isn't it just a childish fantasy that you'll defend your town from griefers? Look, if you want to defend yourself, all you need is iron armour and a tnt cannon, point a tnt cannon at a problem then fire and there's no problem. 

To make matters worse, with unbreaking enchantment books, we have high capacity diamond armour on the streets. 

-----

**What is to be done**

We need comprehensive background checks before people are allowed enchanted armour, do you really want unstable hcf war victims with post traumatic grump disorder to be allowed armour that protects them from attack? 

Look, prot is a weapon of war, it doesn't belong on the streets. it should be given to strong very reliable groups that specialise in defence against wolf attack and also stopping and searching those who have dark skins downloaded (obviously trying to hide). Along with the new powers granted to ttk2 to observe us as well as president ttk2's unmanned bots, we should be able to ensure safety. 

If we can't ban all armour, I would suggest that we confiscate all chestplates, because they have shoulder things as well as tactical chest coverage.

-------

------

* We have the fixed map now, it should work just fine, what it did was locate and delete the four broken chunks, they will now be regenerated in vanilla style, so if you find yourself in a vanilla chunk when you login, say hi! You crashed the server. 

* Updated Dyncap to a new version, has fancy features like estimated time through the queue and gives players access to the /getqueuesize or /gqs command to see how many players are waiting at the door. 

* I tried messing with the nocheat settings to get the block reappearing thing to go away, its definitely software at this end so tell me if it worked.

* As I have discussed in previous change logs it seems that software optimization goes a lot further than hardware optimization when it comes to what we are doing. This begs the question of if it is a better investment to rent better hardware or put that same money towards development of optimizations. [Intreppid](https://www.intreppid.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0) seems reasonable, but its more than $100 more a month than we are paying now. DDOS protection at Javapipe is about $100 a month, so not expensive at all compared to other providers. Also Intreppid is really just a Stammius reseller, and Stammius charges an arm and a leg for DDOS protection so it makes me kinda suspicious. 


* Decreased hostile mob spawn cap from 20 to 15 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing as well as a entry limit. 

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make? 



* I would like to thank all of you, thank you for your help and support, have fun.

1358996517.0,63,self.Civcraft,1760lw,On Operation Liberty Rising.,78,15,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1760lw/on_operation_liberty_rising/,"To begin - the objective of this operation was not to fight. We were in no way looking for a conflict or battle. In this post ( http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/172pbi/gonna_free_some_prisoners_tonight/ ), Mcfluffykins had claimed he would begin releasing prisoners. That didn't happen, and was postponed until, supposedly, tonight. It was stated, somewhere in that thread, that Spurion's vault (at -21,-21) would not be opened, even though the prisoners had served their sentences and most all of the server agreed it was time they were freed.

That said, our aim was to open Spurion's vault. There were few people online who had come from the HCF server, and we had hoped that we would see little resistance and be able to talk through our reasoning for opening the vault with those members that did show up. *In short, we were simply attempting to free those that we consider innocent or pearled unjustly.* 

And thus, we gathered our group - a combined group of the LSIF, AnCaps, Prussians, statists, and nomads of the server - and met in Liberty to move on what was once the 0,0 monument. We stopped to regroup in Chesterstead, and were met with the face of first crashete and a few others. I will restate this before I go on - *our objective was NOT a fight, we did not intend to engage these other players, we intended to free other players of the server.* 

I'm not sure who struck first, but almost immediately after contact, we were engaged with crashete. Richard_T, Atrvmis, Livided, Twiggy, and fart arrived on the scene within moments, and our two sides clashed. The battle came to grounds in the land between Chesterstead and 0,0. It started out grim for our side - two losses for us near the beginning - but things turned around quickly. Both sides gained momentum as we twirled and pearled around the battlefield, and eventually the fight moved to 0,0, by which time more players had joined the fight on both sides.

After some conflict at the old 0,0 monument, the players our side had pearled were vaulted, and the same for our players on their side. The gear of the fighters on the opposing WuTang/Dionysian side had run its course, and they retreated. Therefore, we did the same, and the fight ended. 

**To conclude:** We - *a collective group of the majority of the server's dominant factions* - attempted to free the innocent prisoners of Spurion's vault. Members of the HCF/Wutang/Dionysian Empire would either have none of this, or simply wanted a fight, and intercepted us. There was a large battle with losses on both sides, and our end objective was not reached. 

**To the HCF/Wutang/Dionysian Empire members:** I hope you see this for what it is, or what it was to be, not for what you made it. As I said, I'm not sure which side struck first, be it crashete or one of my group. But please understand this was not our intention. We were simply acting on the information from Fluffy's post and our own desire to free the imprisoned people of a server we know and love. Y_ankees, in his recent post, stated ""It appears that someone important to the fallen world police is housed there"" and, in fact, this is true. Not because one of our close friends is placed in there, not because one of our alts is placed in there, but for the simple fact that *each and every single person that called this server home is important to us.* We all have our roots here, whether they are deep or shallow, they have all found water in the community and fellowship we have created for ourselves.

All we were hoping for was a few hours of time to free innocents (as proclaimed by many of yourselves along with many of us) from a vault you did not have access to.

**To the people of the server, innocents, griefers, free and pearled players alike:** I apologize if you feel caught up in all of this without your knowledge or without your consent. As I've stated in the post, we intended to get you innocents out, and hopefully return to the normal everyday life of the server. This: http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/175rwm/bad_news_for_good_people/ is not our doing, it is the result of a series of bad reactions to good things, a series of reactions that could have been avoided had the opposing side not simply wanted to fight us. 

Our intentions had been made clear well before we organized ourselves for the operation tonight, and I personally made sure members of our side understood that this was *solely* a vault cracking mission, and we would not engage unless we were engaged first. I understand how a large mass of people tripping snitches would be mistaken for a hostile force, but the response from the HCF side showed much more hostility than we had ever intended. I hope both sides can see the battle today for what it is, and not an expression of power or intent to rid anyone from the server.

Thank you.

Today we come together to found the Grand Hall of Justice. Today we move further toward bringing order to the chaos.
 
Mayor ttk2 [has enacted new policy to create the Hall](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18wmo5/its_time_for_some_changes_in_policy/) and to empower it to protect the accused and bring Justice to the guilty. I’m going to expand on his comments on formal accusation policy, and then I’m going to make some threats - take them *very* seriously. I will also provide a list of people who have been banned recently and dates from which any pearlings by them will be reversed.
 
As Mayor ttk2 said, we are ending the policy of public formal accusation. I understand why this would bother people, and I fought this for a while until I was convinced it was necessary. We’ve had several instances recently where people accused of cheating then took it out in-game on their accusers. This discourages the reporting of cheaters. To combat that, we’re taking the process in-house. There *are* going to be a lot of times when we have to reveal to the accused (if not by name at least in implication) where the alleged violation occurred, but sometimes we will just be able to confirm by teleporting to the person and watching them for a bit.

What this means for you, citizen: If you have an accusation to make, you can either post it on the subreddit (and risk retaliation) or send it to modmail, and have Judges handle it from there. This probably isn’t going to make a large difference, other than the fact that there may be slightly less fodder for /r/SRD.
 
Now to address a major problem we’ve been having. As many of you have noticed, and as many threads on the subreddit have pointed out, the valiant men and women of my team have lost ground at times in the battle against injustice. Quite a few of those we have banned have returned within hours or days with different accounts and IPs, some on VPNs. We take this as seriously as you do – keeping your faith in the game is my primary objective. Judges, however, have a tough job. It is difficult to tie accounts to specific banned players. I cannot just ban on suspicion, because every citizen deserves better than that. At the same time, we have to change tack.
 
The first act of the Grand Hall Of Justice is to announce and enforce new Laws against aiding and abetting banned players. Getting caught circumventing a ban may carry consequences up to and including: clearing the inventories of close associates, deleting Citadel groups on which players caught are moderators (*or in egregious cases, possibly members*). Close associates who are known to be aware that those with whom they are associating are alts of banned players may also be subject to temporary or even permanent bans. Communal chests may be cleared, and in some cases pearls taken in battle that even included one banned player may be unpearled.

If you know your associates are alts of banned players, disassociate yourself immediately. Rat them out to the Hall of Justice. Get your stuff out and go. We are catching these criminals (albeit somewhat slowly), and we’re working out ways to do it better. We are going to give you a bit of time to perform this disassociation, but get it done as quickly as possible if you value playing on this server.

Stay vigilant, citizen.

I've long held that map generation is one of the most effective long-term ways to alter gameplay on any Minecraft server. If you want a scarcity of a certain ore, you need only generate fewer of that ore. Want a landscape more conducive to building? Generate a map with larger and flatter plains. Want deeper oceans? Do it. Also, while plugins require constant upgrading to keep up with Minecraft updates (which causes a delay in upgrading the server), maps can instantly convert with few issues. Plugins also require new learning for players coming from SSP or the vanilla client, which can dissuade many. (""""What is pearling?""  ""Why do blocks reappear when I break them?""  ""What's a snitch?"") Maps generated with different ore proportions or different landscapes are much easier to adjust to. Clearly, making a gameplay adjustment in the initial map generation is very preferable to a gameplay adjustment through plugins.

In CivTest, we've tried several different techniques in order to alter gameplay through the map generation. Natural reinforcement, flatter land, and larger caverns are all examples of this. 

One possibility we haven't tried is a different sea level or a related different ground depth. In the real world, digging extremely deep tunnels or flattening literal mountain ranges is basically impossible. Even on custom-made maps, though, the depth under your feet is almost always constant. ""Bedrock,"" is synonymous with a flat layer at the literal bottom of a map. But what if the distance from sea level to bedrock varied greatly? What if mountains had bedrock cores and were therefore impossible to completely cut away?

I've made a quick sketch (Sorry, it's Microsoft Paint) of the idea. Basically most land would have little room to expand underground, causing cities to be mainly above ground and visible from the surface instead of subterranean tunnel networks that would never work in real life. On the rare occasion of a mineralvein, the bottom layer of bedrock would dip down, with no surface indication. Players would be forced to mine around searching for these deposits, which would likely not overlap with prime farm land. Consequently, some cities would be built over large ore deposits and others in biomes conducive to agriculture or growing trees. It might be strategic to build over land with a high bedrock level to prevent attackers from tunneling beneath city walls. Railroads would need to circumvent mountain ranges instead of just plowing through them like nothing. Hopefully, forcing players to settle in various locations in order to provide all the necessary resources would encourage long-distance interaction and trade/raiding for resources.

Another new utilization of an existing mechanic in CivCraft is widespread natural reinforcement of stone. Deeper stone would be more greatly reinforced, as I've shown in the map cross-section below. The darkest gray color is bedrock (or optionally, extremely reinforced stone), the lightest is barely-reinforced stone, and the in-between color is of medium or strong reinforcement. Ores would be found in corresponding layers depending on rarity.

As you will also see below, Nether-like regions could be integrated into the base of mountains. These would difficult to enter but would contain the resources normally only available in the Nether (This is assuming, as many have suggested, that the Nether isn't included as a separate realm in the next map iteration.)

tl;dr Through varying bedrock levels, we can accomplish many of the goals of an ""ideal"" world for CivCraft without requiring many additional plugins.


The proposed map cross-section: http://i.imgur.com/Aw6gkKa.png

I included several land forms and types for demonstration purposes, so they're not necessarily drawn to scale. Mountains would definitely be very much larger and nearly reach the height limit in order to make them a natural barrier to travel.

I have two major announcements.

1) ""Girl, you lookin' Auld Lang *Fiiine!*"" does not work as a pick-up, and

2) Civtest will be returning in the New Year.

For new players, Civtest is a short-cycle alternative to Civcraft that we used to test out new ideas. The map is different, the server only lasts as long as it needs to then we throw it out, and it gives people an opportunity to play around in a cool new environment without affecting the live server. 

We want to test out Mat's 1.4.6 beacon alterations before running them on the production server, but we want to get the ball rolling right away anyway. I'm sure that HCF will definitely not put it in everyone's butt.

On a personal note, I just want to say that this past year has been one of the best of my short number. Finding Civcraft, killing my way up the ranks, then subtly abusing my power to ban people from a server I don't actually play has been a fantastic experience.

To get a look at the problem, all one has to do is take a look at the current front page , and really, the front pages of the last several months. What's our top drama right now? A big exposé about hackers, cheaters, alts, and various other scumbaggery. In fact, this kind of story would find itself right at home on the HCF subreddit. That's really all this type of drama is: generic, unmotivated, and petty conflict.  

Does anyone remember what big drama was taking place a year ago on Civcraft? Yeah, that's right, it was the LSIF leak scandal. Does anyone remember what happened shortly after that? Columbiagate. 

Anyone notice any differences between those two types of drama and server-happenings? One kind is stupid and shallow and shouldn't belong in a politically-inspired community. The other type is exactly what we want to foster; a kind of situation that tests the ideas of civilizations and societies; that provides life-blood to the server. 

Even the griefing on this server has gone down the tubes. Last June when I first formed my griefing group, we were a politically-motivated body dedicated on bringing down the government of Columbia. I'm not talking about using fake political bullshit as an excuse to grief like rupturedKidney does, assassinating Foofed and changing the government of Columbia was literally what brought us together. Yes, we failed miserably, but that's not the point. Now contrast this type of griefing with the type we get now and have gotten for several months. Gimmick Brigade, Gimmick Brigade 2.0, and a whole bunch of moronic 12-year olds who have nothing better to do than grind out Prot 4 and throw themselves in waves against towns (i.e. Orion). 

In short, I feel that we've strayed away from what Civcraft was meant to be, ""to foster discussion, experimentation and community building."" That quote is straight from the sidebar. And it's up to you, Civcraft, to help restore our community to its former glory. I'd give anything to be back in the glory days of Civcraft, when the LSIF and Ancaps fought daily wars.

This means that what constitutes a ""crime"" on the server is up to the players and players alone.

Now, we on Civcraft generally pride ourselves on trying to create a restorative justice system rather than a retributive justice system. Essentially, if you commit a crime, you will expected to pay back full damages otherwise you'll be sitting in the end. A lot of times that's all you'll have to do. For more heinous crimes people take a more punitive stance (like myself), but those are rare instances.

Another thing we pride ourselves on here is Burden of Proof. There are ways to show that crimes where committed. Combat tag shows if you strike someone and snitches show block breaks. Usually when someone accuses another of a crime, there will be a screenshot of some sort showing evidence of the crime.

**What Should I do if I'm accused of a crime?**

The first thing you should do is go on here and demand proof. If there's no evidence of wrongdoing, the community will generally side with you, and you'll be on your merry way in no time.

If there is evidence against you, you're pretty fucked. You should probably work towards getting someone to arbitrate on your behalf. This person will work with you and the affected party to come up with a fair amount that you'll have to pay back in damages. Once a number is agreed upon, pay it and you'll be free to go.

If you can't pay back damages, work with the person you wronged to come up with a payment plan. I'd advise against agitating the person further as they could just keep you in the end and for the most part people won't care.

**On Bounties**

A lot of time when people are wronged, they won't have the PvP skills or the wherewithal to go after the criminal. At this point they'll post a bounty on a sub to be paid to any bounty hunters to capture or ""pearl"" the criminal. Bounties in the past have been very effective in bringing people to justice. *It is my personal opinion that any bounty placed on the criminal should NOT be added to the damages caused by the criminal.*

If anyone has anything to add or any critisisms I welcome them below.

The thing that both of those groups had in common was that they had the support of the people, not all the people, but enough to get away with the crimes they did. While what the gimmick brigade is not even comparable to what the HCF did for months, both of those situations can be compared to real things that happened in history.

Al Capone and his group had a lot of power and he was able to avoid capture because the people in the area actually supported him. He harmed a lot of people, but at the same time helped a lot of people, he did a lot of charity for children and ran soup kitchens. He actually was lead and funded the lobby to make it required to have an expiration date. The community would help him hide and not rat him out to the police.

Another example would be the Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar. He evaded the law while having caused the deaths of many people because of the community service he did. The townspeople loved Pablo Escobar and were willing to protect him. 

Both of these situations match up with these groups, the HCF during the last few weeks of the map used the Gimmick brigade and RKWildCard to justify going after innocent people. People actually stood up and fought innocent people with the HCF during that time, because they felt the small bit of ""community service"" they did can make up for all the harm they did to innocents for months.

The Gimmick Brigade also used fighting the HCF as a way to make them seem like what they did was not so bad. Both of these situations should be something the community is wary about. The next time you support criminals for your own gain, or for the communities gain, you are allowing these crimes to continue,if you don't learn from the past you are bound to repeat it.

At that time I was dealing with:

- The worst episode of depression I've had since starting treatment, being worsen by crushing loneliness. 

- The worst anxiety I've had from the stress of not knowing what to do with my future. It was so bad that I finally had to take some of my anxiety medication.

- Isolation that was seeming to grow into social anxiety

- Insomnia that was just making everything worst and completely reversed my sleep cycle.

I was meaning to write this earlier but I'm a pretty lazy guy and recently one of my Civcraft friends have been dealing with things that sound exactly like what I've been dealing with. So I decided to write this to let him, and everyone else dealing with this shit know there is another side.

So pretty much my day consisted of reddit and youtube, I didn't even play any games since the depression had taken all joy out of them. Well, while browsing /r/TumblrInAction I came across [this thread of ""deaf privilege meets blind privilege""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/18j8si/check_your_deaf_privilege/c8ff0c0) and was very confused as why they were talking about feels when they usually make fun of the feels. Well I decided to download Katawa Shoujo and see what the fuss was about since I did hear about it before on /r/gaming. Well after playing it I guess I had the most common reaction: http://i.imgur.com/TQbxM.jpg.

This sudden melting of my usually cold and dark heart really hit me hard and made me reflect on my life. I realized I was an idiot for isolating myself and cutting off contact from all my friends. I recently wrote up a huge thing on Facebook explaining my situation and apologizing for cutting them off. I'm still lonely since all my friends are in University and I still don't care for talking over Facebook chat but I can deal with it now. 

Secondly, I have decided I am going to university which has significantly cut down on my stress, now I just gotta worry about somehow getting the money for it seeing that I'm still unemployed (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻. It worked out too because I have been accepted for computer science (with a $4000 scholarship), which I'm kinda glad because I don't think I could be a part of the business world as an accountant. 

Lastly I started to put my small amount of musical talent to use and have picked up playing the keyboard and seem to be doing pretty good so far for only a little bit of practice. I almost feel like picking up the guitar again, but I have decided to just stick with the keyboard for now. I am also starting to enjoy video games again and have started reading since I have always enjoyed that as well (starting with The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy). Oh yeah I almost forgot, I have also developed an addiction for anime.

I was feeling the happiest I have ever been in life for about 2 weeks, with the feeling that the whole world had been lifted off my shoulders and while the great amount of happiness has dissipated, I still feel a lot better than I used to be.

TL;DR: There is another side to mental illness and I want others to know that.

The results were, to say the least, hilarious and conclusive. I’ll give a summary of the past few days, and anyone who wants to check my work can use Skynet to get the data.

Here’s a brief rundown of **all** activity by 008Slash and TurboCactus from March 7th to March 12th. Cases when someone logs out and then back in quickly are concatenated into a single session.


**March 7th**

* 008 logs in at 5:06, leaves at **5:09**
* Turbo logs in at **5:11**, leaves at 5:27
* Turbo: 5:36-7:50
* No Overlap

------------------------------------------------------------

**March 8th**

* 008: 0:49 – 1:22
* 008: 1:26 – 1:29
* 008: 3:24 – 3:40
* Turbo: 5:41-5:42
* Turbo: 5:54-9:41
* 008: 17:22-18:06
* 008: 19:16-19:25
* 008: 22:45-23:34
* No overlap

------------------------------------------------------------

**March 9th**

* 008: 0:22-**0:28**
* Turbo: **0:29**-0:39
* Turbo: 0:43-0:48
* No overlap

------------------------------------------------------------

**March 10th**

* 008: 0:37-0:47
* 008: 1:07 – **1:12**
* Turbo: **1:35** – **1:44**
* 008: **1:49** – 1:59
* No overlap


------------------------------------------------------------

**March 11th**

* Turbo: 5:56-**6:01**
* 008: **6:02 – 6:03** 
* Turbo: **6:04-7:19**
* 008: 22:35-00:00 (next day)
* No overlap

------------------------------------------------------------

**March 12th**

* 008: 00:00-0:47
* 008: 1:32 – 2:00
* 008: 3:55 – **4:45**
* Turbo:  **4:47**- **4:49**
* 008: **4:58** - **5:08**    [make up your mind dude]
* Turbo: **5:12** - 6:00
* Turbo: 17:56 – 17:57
* Turbo: 18:31 – **19:01**
* 008: **19:02** - 19:50
* No overlap

I think the data speak for themselves. 008Shock and TurboCactuc play at remarkably similar hours (basically any time not between 10:00 and 17:00), and yet never manage to overlap, despite often appearing within *seconds* of each other, sometimes back and forth multiple times. **Update:** 008Slash has confessed, case closed.

I'm holding onto the data for the past few days, I'd hate for certain other griefers to start intentionally multi-logging to avoid this kind of investigation, and there's still plenty of data to review. **Stay tuned for more later tonight and tomorrow**.

How did we manage to do all this, the mods, the server hardware, and that which they exist to facilitate, the complexity of the in game world and actions. 

It would be a surprise to say the least to gather a group of people and get from them the funds to buy a machine, the skills to make a mod, and the time commitment to produce such an intricate world.  

And yet, here we stand with essentially the best hardware on the market, a wealth of incredibly complex and high quality mods, and a world dazzling in its depth. 

But if you go looking for the man in charge of raising money for the hardware, the person in charge of making the mods, or the person in charge of making the world interesting you will find exactly no one. 

At every step there was no title, no job description, simply a person with initiative to step forward and get things done. This is ultimately how Civcraft is run and what I am trying to express to people when I say 'get it coded', there is no one in charge of getting that plugin made, no matter how important it may be, there are only the people who do it. 

We don't have chincy admin flairs and ranks, we don't care who you are or what you do, we care about getting things done, about making what we are trying to do here possible. 

It does not even really mean doing it yourself, it means taking charge of getting things done, be that organizing some other group to perform the task or even just connecting the person who will do it to the task. 

I myself have not written a single line of code for a Civcraft mod and yet there is no question that I have been a key figure in seeing them made, everything about Civcraft administration and Civcraft the game itself is predicated not on the idea that there are jobs to which people are assigned but to the idea that people can step forward and change things for the better without being forced to.

**Features**

* Works with Firefox, Chrome, and IE9+ (other browsers not tested)
* Zoom and navigation
* Map key
* City list
* Cities
* Roads (roads, rails, and canals)
* Natural features (oceans, rivers, islands)

**Coming soon**

* Biomes
* Names for Natural Features and Roads
* political boundaries(still up for discussion)

**Only one problem we have no data.** 

[***You can help!***](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivcraftRoads/comments/1dgogg/how_to_collect_map_information_for_rcivcraftroads/)

We need information on Islands, rivers, oceans, and biomes.

And when you city leaders feel you are ready and have a population of more than 10(restricted for your own protection) I will happily put you on the map as well.

Naturally if you're helping them and or attack us you fall under the same group. I've already traveled through many towns and players and caused no harm as well as members I'm with have as well. Even nicklepro yesterday who apparently seems to be an outspoken enemy (which I did not know) was unharmed even as I glanced upon him naked and unable to defend himself. Apparently I stumbled upon the secret town of warren when I saw him.... No longer secret. 

Make no mistake in thinking that the WP and BHC will not be using ""the HCF return"" as a crutch to gain you favor and forgiveness for their actions in our absence, that is their aim as they fear the end of their ""rule"". 

I however intend to attempt to repair partial amounts of our image and gain favor and support from the people of civcraft, though I won't be as naive to think it will become a clean slate or a total forgiveness of our past actions.

This server doesn't have to be a faint war zone like we made it to be and other people have mimicked in our absence.

As many respondents as possible needed.,72,13,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/19tcez/the_sociology_of_griefing_please_read_as_many/,"I am going to be conducting a sociological study of in-game griefing over the next few weeks. Before I post the preface to the study (that is, the objectives of the research), I am going to link you to the questionnaire [here.](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZNVTHT7) I want as many people to answer it as possible, and, rest assured, you will remain anonymous. Please do not respond in an attempt to troll the survey, as your responses will simply be discarded as outlying data. Do it! It'll help our community! :D

*Preface*
Griefing is the deliberate act of destroying or ruining the structures and creations of others in-game. It involves placing or reinforcing blocks on other structures, removing blocks with pickaxes, and replacing structural blocks with uglier ones; all in a way that ruins the aesthetic of a player’s creation. Its repercussions can often be minimal, but can also lead to all-out war, players leaving the game, and indefinite detention in the End. 

Most established players on the server have griefed at some point during their time here. Why do they reform? Is the server able to adapt to ensure all griefers become established, ‘law-abiding’ players? 

Although speculation as to why players of Civcraft grief has been rife since the experiment’s conception, no comprehensive study has yet been carried out in order to discover the factors that cause players to grief and what causes players to form deviant subcultures based around the act of griefing - particularly on a server where the community is largely self-regulating.

The goal of this hopefully comprehensive study is to shed some light on the socioeconomic factors that create the ‘gerfing’ culture, why these factors persist, and ultimately, what this means for crime control, punishment and prevention on the server.

I will utilise a range of both quantitative and qualitative research methods in a process of methodological triangulation. This enables me to overcome the shortcomings of both. Quantitative methodology offers a high level of reliability; that is, grief statistics that can be correlated, compared and repeated to strong effect. Qualitative methodology, although lacking reliability, offers a significant level of validity - something that quantitative methodology does not. Thus, utilising a variety of methods will allow me to overcome the problems of both.

The research methods I will be utilising will be questionnaires consisting of mainly closed questions for the purposes of statistical analysis, but also open questions in order to enable respondents to divulge further information that a closed question would not allow for. In keeping with the method of triangulation, I will also be conducting a series of semi-structured interviews with both griefers and the ‘victims’ of griefers. Interviews will allow me to discover the real-world factors that motivate in-game crime, as well as enable a detailed analysis of the impact in-game griefing has on real-world people. I will also be discussing my personal involvement in griefing, thus involving another qualitative method - that of overt participant observation - as well as my experiences as a victim of griefing. All griefers mentioned, all respondents and all interviewees will be given pseudonyms in order to remain anonymous, to avoid any ethical problems the research could encounter.

Is it to annoy? Is it to offend? Is it out of desperation? A lack of solidarity? Is griefing politically motivated? If so, what factors drive these urges within the players to commit griefing? This is what my study hopes to find out.


**Please take the time to respond, and PM me if you are interested in an interview. I'd like an even balance of victims of gerf and griefers themselves, and, again, you will be given a pseudonym in the final piece of research. It will really help the study.**

Before i start out let this be a cautionary warning **ENCHANTS ARE RANDOM AND PERCENTAGE BASED EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE SAME GEAR AS YOUR OPPONENT DAMAGE AND PROTECTION MAY VARY**

* **The Gear:** In order to reach your maximum protection, your going to need to get full EPF. EPF is the value of your all your protection armor added together for simple terms, and it caps at 25. To think of it like this you can add the number of protection levels you have together and the end result must = 9 or higher. Although going higher then 9 is still valid it wont help you anymore as it caps the EPF limit, this is why the best possible load out it protection IV chest and legs then protection I boots with a unenchanted helmet. The reason for this is that protection enchants also make your armor take **more damage**, with this load out you would reach max EPF on the strongest items before your armor breaking. It can be really important in long fights that you have this as armor durability is everything and can be the difference between life and death. The next thing your gonna want is some solid sharpness and power. Now this is were it comes down to personal preference, knockback or no knockback. I prefer to not have it as for me i don't need to distance to switch my hotbar up and it gets in the way pounding my enemy into submission. Reasons you might want knockback on your sword would be things like environment, your connection and fps, ability to switch hotbar, or just simply wanting all enchants on your sword ;P. After you have decided if you want knockback or not you basically just want to aim for a sharp 4 fire 2 looting 3 for obvious reasons. As far as Bows go its up to you i personally dont like them and use snowballs to combat tag enemy's, but getting into a sea battle without one is a death sentence so get a power V punch II if you see fit.



* **The Potions:** Potions are a essential part of pvp and without them dont even bother entering a warzone. You always want atleast 2 instant health II potions (splash because if you need hp stopping and taking 3 seconds to drink a potion is moronic), 2 strength II, 1 fire resistance extended, 1 speed extended/ 2 speed II, and 1 poison extended. The reason i don't include regeneration potions and instant harming II are 1) Ghast tears are incredibly rare it seems and getting you hands on some can be difficult. 2) Instant harming II are completely worthless against a guy in full EPF as they will do half a heart on a direct hit. If you manage to get regeneration potions though make them extended unless you are a ghast breeder. On a sort off non potion related topic some people don't actually know this but milk buckets cancel poison and can be extremely useful if you get a nasty poison extended on you.


* **The Fight:** Once your actually in the fight there are a few strategies you can use to get ahead of your opponent. Ender pearling is your life and death in large scale fights, you ability to escape and initiate with them is vital. Its always good to have a stack in you so it is possible to use them freely. A strong tactic besides just pearling away in one direction is to throw 1 pearl in the direction you facing then quickly throw a 2nd before your first lands. If pulled off correctly you will pearl to the first spot hopefully making your enemy pearl after you then vanish before his eyes and your 2nd pearl tp's you 2-3 chunks away. For those who don't know this yet, jumping in combat will give you critical hit which will deal more damage. This is a little strategy that i have just started using. If you're opponent has just drunk a potion then you can pull a little under the belt move by taking a level 2 version of that potion splash and throwing it in front of your enemy. if you time it right and it lands about 2-3 blocks radius of them then it will override the current potions timer and set it at about 10 seconds or left, you're enemy will never know what hit them!


To wrap it all up the gear,potions, and tactics are all my personal thoughts and strategies, although most the gear is factually the best for pvp. All of the potions and enchants can take you a fair bit of time to grind out and acquire which is why i recommend not practicing with it on this server. I personally have a quad spider grinder at my base and it can take me anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour to get to level 50. At the very least i hope this guide gave you a small under standing of pvp so there is some actual fights on this server and not just senseless slaughter on unguarded noobs that don't know how to pvp.


**Things i forgot to put in the guide**

* A full set of protection II armor is 20/25 EPF, its not capped but it will still give you a decent amount of damage reduction for a much lower grind time. Recommended levels for it are: Helmet 16, Chest 18, Legs 18, boots 22. (reason boots are higher is because it is best chance for protection 2 feather falling 4.)

* After throwing a ender pearl don't keep running in that direction there is a bunch of other things you could do in that time like drink potions, hit your enemy, or fake it out and run in another direction.

Look at the sidebar. See lots of links? Yeah, click em all, shit's fucking good. Also, go to mumble, a place where players get a chance to talk and yell at eachother.
Need more specifics? Here we go.

**Ores**

There's a mod on this server called mineralvein, it was supposed to limit resources into large veins, effectively causing scarcity. Some regions would be barren while others would have Matticus Rex amounts of diamonds. But, the mod only half worked, so there are still many vanilla chunks in the world. Can't find any ores? Want to post on the subreddit? *Don't do that, silly* just walk another half a thousand meters or so and try again

**Map Reset**

When our lord and savior ttk2 feels like it. No one except him and maybe the lesser admin deities know. Just enjoy the current map while it's there

**Economy**

If you actually read about the mods, you're already well versed on the shops mod. If you didn't then you're a poopy head. Seriously go read about it, I read it like six times through when I first joined, and still have to look back at it. 

Is the economy itself collapsing? Well lets take a step back. Civcraft doesn't have a universal economy. Some major items like exp stacks and diamonds generally cost about the same wherever you go, but other things like wood, stone, labor all depend on who's buying and selling. Some of you may have seen posts regarding iron farms. Does this mean you should raise your prostitution fees up a few irons? If you want. If you think there's too much iron circulating, raise your prices. 

**Wars**

Civcraft has a violent history. But organized faction versus faction wars simply do not happen. The closest things to wars were the Infinius raids, Pumpkin Jack-Lazuli war, Avernum incident, Havana tnt crisis, and maybe even the recent Augusta Civil War. Go read about those elsewhere or in my upcoming book *Tears on a Keyboard.*

Is there going to be a World War soon? No, not unless these HCFactions kids effectively organize into a group and wage war with whoever.

**Ideologies**

There's lots of em, ranging from Anarcho Capitalism (the evil worker-oppresive capitalists and their leader Foofed) to Minarchism. Want to start your own ideology? Go out and do it. 

""So I started my own ideology, where I kill and steal and lava bomb, but then R3kon pearled me, what gives?""

Just because you ""play differently than other people"" doesn't mean others are going to sit there and take it. If you are doing something someone else doesn't like, they will pearl you and send you to D-Block, and the Prussians ain't there no more to make it look pretty. 

**Griefing**

Ew, griefers, amarite? If you're pearled by a griefer, post here or go on mumble. What's mumble? Return to the page and start over. Want to grief? Do it at your own will. 

""But I have alts, I'll just grief with my other alt""

That's fine and dandy, but once two usernames, linked to *you* as *your* alts **are pearled**, then you're banned. 

""This server is weak, they ban you just for pouring lava on ancaps""

Unless you cheated (xray, speed/strength hacks/ fly hacks) you were not banned. You were pearled. Put away forever under Foofed's vault to be banished for all eternity with the endermen. Well, you can get out. Eventually. If you pay reperations to the people you harmed and/or serve some time, you'll be out. Some people who did some awful shit back in the day are contributing to society currently, probably worshiping sheep or manufacturing P.

**P**

It's a way of life. Just try some P

**TL;DR** The AnCaps already mined all of the ores, the map is resetting tomorrow, the economy has already collapsed, again, Ancaps, the next world war started when Gerald allied with Haven and invaded Augusta, go to 5000, 5000 to get some pvp action on, the ideologies all died, griefing is perfectly acceptable, it adds excitement but you will be banned by admin crimes, P is a poison you can consume.

I didn't think I would be writing this the other day. I thought i'd just make a silly post like i always do, and slip away into the night. But after some serious thinking, I thought I would address issues I had with the server, and the direction it is heading in. 

  Back in august of 2012 when i first joined, the server was a quaint little place, with many amazing builds. The people were nice and helpful, and not once did i feel threatened. I found an abandoned city, and adopted it as my own. Some of you may know this place as wolvania. I gained quite a following, and after a while we restored the town to its former glory. That was the best time for the server for me. Sure we had a griefer here and there, but it was nothing we couldn't handle. That's when the hcf invaded. These people destroyed everything they touched, and killed everyone. All for what? Just for the lulz, according to them. 

I'm not saying the HCF are still the problem, but they are certainly how it started. Peoples homes and entire towns were destroyed for no reason, and people mass pearled. It got so bad, it destroyed the SERVER. All because someone couldn't cheat and steal the way they wanted. These neckbeards with to much time on their hands would get up at 3 AM and destroy peoples virtual castles, because they could. They would get up destroy, and at the end of the day, get on mumble, and talk about how they fucked our moms. (I'm looking at you theo.) I'm at fault too. I would find myself doing this, and just think ""Wtf am i doing?"" But that's the issue, even now. My issue is paranoia. I don't want to worry about logging off, or building a town, because some guy with too much time on his hands could destroy it at any second. I would check my MC like every hour, because i was so scared. I don't want that feeling. That's not fun. And i'm sure it's not fun for you guys either. It's certainly fun for them, because they literally have nothing else to do. They aren't creative, They don't have lives, They just do it because it's the only thing they can do. You've all turned civcraft into another generic pvp server.

1364479499.0,63,self.Civcraft,1b6dn8,Morning report for 3/28/2013,66,3,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1b6dn8/morning_report_for_3282013/,"Last night at around 1:42 CST Ryan HTP gathered what is probably every single resource have could get his hands on and launched another attack on the new Civcraft server (henceforth known as Achilles). Where his previous attacks where about 400k PPS or 4Gpbs (for the laymen about a library of congress every 32 seconds) this new attack tacked another zero onto the metrics, clocking in at 4000k PPS, 10+Gpbs, and about one library of congress every 2 seconds.

Not a single person online at that time noticed. Javapipe, despite not officially selling that much protection and the fact that we are only paying for about 1/8th the protection of the attack magnitude mitigated the entire thing  for no additional cost. The only way anyone even knew it happened was when I had a nice email conversation with one of their very helpful network engineers this morning. 

In short Javapipe exceeds all known scales of awesome, if anyone ever needs DDOS protection I know exactly who to recommend. 


*Please note that all the above metrics are approximates and involve conversions between units that may not be so easily comparable.* 

-----

Now onto actual server matters, we will hopefully be able to get our data off of Titan and into the new machine by early tomorrow. In the meantime I have spruced up the temporary server with RandomSpawn and a testing version of Riot Mod, I would love to hear how everything is working with that mod. 

It seems that the network protection will sometimes kick players by accident, this seems to fade almost entirely over time as your connection becomes constant enough to be ruled out as a false positive for an attack. 

Finally I am in need of a little scripting help when it comes to a backup script that can do a backup over either sftp or rsync to a remote server as our new VM has very little space for backups.

1359694505.0,59,self.Civcraft,17ofcy,For those of you who do not read the morning change logs here is some important information about changes to PrisonPearl,76,17,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17ofcy/for_those_of_you_who_do_not_read_the_morning/,"Provided people continue to be helpful in testing and development goes smoothly I hope to get the new pearling cost changes to PrisonPearl online by the end of next week after we have tested them sufficiently (or not, when people stop testing we just do it live). 

For those of you otherwise unaware we have a new version of PrisonPearl that consumes coal as a cost for keeping a pearl imprisoned. 

To explain this in more detail, every time the server restarts PrisonPearl will attempt to find 8 coal per pearl stored in the chest along with the pearl, if its there it will consume that coal, if not it will free the prisoners (if you have more than one it feeds them in alphabetical order until out of coal) please note that the cost must be coal, not charcoal or any other substitute. 

As it pertains to the server economy and operation I think its going to be interesting and present some problems as well as some solutions, there are currently 570 pearled people on Civcraft, that means 71.25 stacks of coal must be consumed every day as the bare minimum to keep them all pearled. 

Obviously this cost will have a chilling effect on large scale pearling and long term storage, while it is possible to fill a double chest with one pearl and coal and have that supply last for 424 days unattended not many people warrant such behavior. Either way though any justice system is going to have to organize formally or be totally ineffective, donations can not be consistent enough to manage the costs of keeping large numbers of criminals freed and as such people will either need to organize to supply their justice systems or see them become ineffective. Groups that have no supplying organization or consistent player base are going to have significant trouble keeping up with maintenance of their pearls alone much less doing anything else at all. 

Overall a player with a high fortune pick and knowledge of coal veins is the ideal here, specialized workers that need to be supplied and organize by a society, while I may consider lowering the cost from 8 coal per pearl per day I think this is going to do some very interesting things to the mechanic and Civcraft as a whole.

In the months since I wrote that post I have found that I am not so much of a masochist as I thought. Instead of implementing this plan we went with option Dredd. The plans very little up until a point, both use sets of investigators lead by final judges that do not play, both provide for review by all administrators, both are insomuch as is humanly possible for us to confirm, fair. The heart and soul of the difference is in how they talk, not to me but to you. 

The simple act of being quieter about things has made all the difference in the world, instead of treating every issue as a public debate it is resolved internally and then published as a side note if at all. At the end of the day, I have found that for all my commitment to respecting my players intelligence I, nor anyone else, has the fortitude to fight an army for every step of a long journey. Its amazing how actions devoid of fanfare pass without a mention where before they would have been covered in raging debate wall to wall.  

There is an argument, one I make to myself everyday, before as a pep talk and now with a tinge of regret, that doing things this way is somehow the lesser of the solutions. That despite all the hardship lost and achievement gained things are not quite is good as they could have been. But it is only by virtue of giving up that hardship that I have been able to avoid going insane, must less continue operating the server in any acceptable capacity. 

Ultimately Civcraft is freedom. No, I did not mean to write that Civcraft can be summed up as freedom, nor that its purpose is freedom but that everything Civcraft is, has been, or can be, is a product of its players, that is the goal. Strangely enough Civcraft seems more a product of this goal than a tool designed to achieve it. 

Trying to toe the line between taking burdens we can not carry or betraying some of our core principles has been a continuous challenge for administrators and in its own way for the player-base as well. When attacked people fight, when faced with Civcraft's true societal problems people seem to leave. The fight is exciting but the true challenge is the burden freedom puts on the players as well as the administrators to shape and maintain the world for the better, it seems it is just as tiring for them as it can be for us. 

Why bother then?

We come full circle with Masochists game here, if it is truly so much easier to play or create a normal game, one without the freedom that is Civcraft's inspiration, purpose, and fuel, why the hell do any of us bother? 

When the idea for Civcraft first occurred to me, the first thing I realized was that it was going to be impossible. That the tools and resources required where far beyond my reach and that even if the tools and resources where mine to use it may be beyond my ken to make it a reality. I decided to try it anyways, even if all I had was a rowboat and half a paddle and at every single step along the way I have gone to sleep believing that this next challenge was insurmountable only to wake up and tackle it anyways. Impossibly we seem to keep wining. 



If you feel Civcraft is not what it once was, or what you wish it to be realize that all it has ever been is what you made of it. If this is your time to check out I don't begrudge you that. But I realize that as much as I work to make Civcraft a better place I have to ask all of you to work with me.  




Thank you for your time.

At untamedears.com:25566",67,8,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16vqgd/join_everyones_favorite_dirty_peasant_simulator/,"Some of you poor sods may be wondering ""what exactly is this Civtest thingamajigy?"" and the answer to that question, my slack jawed and dull eyed friend, is rather simple. 

Civtest, to put it simply, exists to make you miserable, in fact the explicit goal of many of the changes I would outline in a few moments is, that if you are very lucky, you just might not starve to death in your dirt hovel. 

You see the biggest problem with Civcraft is simply that there are not enough poor people, and not enough starving people. Income inequality is a almost non existent concept, anyone with the right strategy can be equal to anyone else and gaining wealth is as easy as walking off into the hills and picking a nice looking spot to dig down. 

In Civtest we strive to avoid such idealism by working to amplify your misery as much as possible. 

With that in mind, its time to start explaining some of the features of Civtest. 

* Veins: Not some, not most, but *all* ore on Civtest maps exists in veins, which you have to find either through sheer luck or a deep understanding of Orthzar's troubled psyche. Now there may or may not be surface indicators that these veins exist, but what fun would telling you those be? 

* Natural reinforcement: As if the veins where not enough, once you manage to find the god forsaken things its not quite as easy as jumping in and digging till its all gone. Ores on this map are naturally reinforced, meaning you have to break them a given number of times before you actually get the block. So, no absconding with a whole vein in a few hours, you have to work at it. Diamond ore is 150 breaks, Iron 75 breaks, Redstone and coal 10. 

* RealisticBiomes and growth changes: Now you see, normally you could grow some bread and go running off to find these veins, but, that is not quite miserable enough for us, so we had to do our best to make sure you starve. RealisticBiomes is a pretty simple mod, it makes bonemeal useless for growing things and make sure you can only grow crops in [these locations](http://i.imgur.com/fz7AGKA.png) or in underground farms lit by glowstone. This is combined with my own changes slowing the growth of all crops to 10% normal speed and setting wild mobs to spawn more rarely. 

* Now, one of you fools who manages to fall down a mineshaft and land in a diamond vein may ask ""what can I do with all this unjustly earned wealth?"" now the answer to that question, other than hiring wage slaves, is very simple, you get to use [MachineFactory](https://github.com/MrTwiggy/MachineFactory/wiki/MachineFactory-Documentation) to further oppress the dirty poor, simply watch the videos, burn incredible amounts of wealth (up for adjustment since i really don't think it was setup with Civtest in mind at the moment) and watch the wonderful machines do your bidding along with the wage slaves! 

* MorePhysics: As if starvation and poverty where not enough, there is also a sincere lack of death due to various accidents within this game. As such we present to you [MorePhysics](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/morephysics/) to drown you in your armor, sink your boat, get you run over by minecarts, and killed by bouncing. 

* Finally, provided everyone is not sitting dead of starvation in their dirt hovels you have one last thing to aspire to, better beacons is a upcoming mod that will allow you to directly apply beacon effects to groups and only groups and should allow you to get a little perk in your step despite your crippling poverty. 

So everyone, welcome to Civtest, to survive you are going to require higher than average cooperation to grow food and gather resources. Otherwise, enjoy starving to death in your dirt hovels.

According to him, I'm a member of some large resistance group. News to me. He wanted to know where these bases were so he could ""kill them all"".

I decided to be friendly with him and have a little chat. After a few messages, the conversation seemed to have ended. I gathered some materials for a relief effort in the end (no reason people pearled by the hcf shouldn't be able to enjoy the game at least somewhat). I headed into the nether and immediately received a message from Russian saying ""you're being pretty brave"". Apparently they have snitches all over the nether and I shouldn't be using the roads because randomly, I'm a target now. I told him I didn't give a fuck because I was headed to the end anyway. Conversation lulled again.

I brought my inventory to the end and began helping another player with getting a farm and cobble generator set up. I met this player on Marienberg and quickly received another message from Russian. ""How's Marienberg? It's too bad for [player] that you're helping him. He's now added to the ""do not release"" list.""

So let me get this straight, this guy is going to be punished because I'm helping him and I'm part of some imaginary resistance? Cool, bro.

Tell ya what, if there actually is a resistance, get at me. If I'm going to be accused of something, might as well do it, isn't that how it works hcf?

Russian did give me some good info though:
They have snitches everywhere.

They're only here to fight.

When they run out of people to fight, they'll turn on each other.

If I were resistance, my strategy would be to bide my time until they started in-fighting. Then sit back and enjoy the show.

We did not build it, we re-appropriated it for our own use. It is not our game. Mojang, as they're currently developing, are making a different game to us. They make decisions based on a vision that we do not share. They prioritise things that are at best ambivalent for us, and at worst absolutely detrimental to the vision of what we want the game to be.

Thanks to a combination of breaking bugs and broken mechanics, Minecraft is not a perfect client-base for a game like Civcraft. Don't get me wrong, it's served us well, and it has a lot going for it: A huge client base, low cost of entry for new players (most people have Minecraft), familiarity, well-documented modifications (whilst we constantly complain about Modding API, at least we have the shared background and ability to create somewhat passable mods), an intensely active dev-orientated userbase (Bukkit/Spigot etc), and the fact that it's essentially a popular and very good singleplayer creative/survival game. This is not a tirade against Minecraft or Mojang who've created one of those games that will go down in the history of gaming as a landmark, one that I'm proud to be a very very tiny part of. Rather, I'm here to complain about you.

Yes, you. You right there, with the mouse and the keyboard, or the touch screen. You with the hair, with those eyes, with all that thang goin' on in the mid'. And me too. The main problem of Civcraft, the one that makes it incredibly difficult to administrate, is that we all (well, those of us who aren't here specifically to trawl drama and generally create trouble) fell in love with a sidebar. We fell madly, deeply in love with an idea... and that's why it breaks our heart when any action is taken that seems to deviate from that idea, that vision. Because that's the game we want to play, and in some brief beautiful moments in the past Civcraft has touched close to that idea, albeit briefly. And this... this is our greatest achievement and our biggest flaw.

Falling in love with an idea is like lusting after a ghost. You can see it, you want it, but when you try to touch it in a sexually inappropriate way you phase right through. The problem Civcraft has is a fairly simple one, and yet one that I feel most people aren't aware of: That sidebar right there, the one just to the right of the screen? Civcraft isn't that. And as long as Civcraft is tied to the Minecraft client, it can't ever be that.

None of the admins want to interfere. Firstly, it causes ripples that disrupt people's perceptions of that Sidebar and its murky water. Secondly, it's a lot of fucking effort that none of us would like to deal with. However, given that the Minecraft client is buggy as shit and has several features that have we have a forced awareness of, we can't not. That's the be all and end all of it. As long as Minecraft is how it is, Civcraft will be how it is.

Being an Administrator on Civcraft is an act of maintenance. Every time Bukkit updates, we struggle and run around and try to play catch up with our mods. Every time Mojang changes something inherent in the design of the game, we have to fight against it to stop it from tearing our little world apart. And every time someone does something that entirely circumvents what we've done here, we have to draw back the line and maintain it. That's what we are. We aren't judiciaries or lawmen or authoritarians or developers: We're janitors, and it's our job to make sure the piles of trash don't overflow and ruin everyone's day.

As much as we'd like to never have to manually pearl someone again, administrator interference is an inevitability. We haven't built a game based entirely on that sidebar over there that we all fell in gooey sticky love with, we've changed another game to look as much like it as possible. We've tied down a wild beast, dressed him up in a little colour-coordinated peacoat and hat, and taught him how to be civilized. Every now and then he remembers what he is, rears his head, goes wild for a bit and we have to put his little hat back on, and it would be a better time for everyone if the playerbase could just accept this for what it is.

In conclusion, the subreddit sidebar is not a description of the server... it's a roadmap. It's an idea, it's the bait that we follow, the vision that we attempt to adhere to, the cleaned up picture of the fast food burger in the TV advert. It's what we want to be, but it isn't what we are. We've come closer than any other Minecraft server online today, maybe even any other videogame, but we aren't there yet. We might never be there, and because of that certain inevitabilities should be presumed.

Finally, I'd just like to make a couple of side-but-related points:

1) The sidebar is not a justification for being a prick. Minecraft's shitty mechanics allow for small coordinated groups to, in a very short period of time, become of equal strength to long-established power bases. This is rubbish, and does not match that sidebar-vision of an actual simulation of society, so using the sidebar as a justification for this sort of behaviour is ridiculous.

2) We are a very small team of human beings, and thus sometimes things take time, and sometimes we make mistakes. There's a saying that goes ""If you do something right, people wont notice you've done anything at all,"" and in my short time here as an administrator I'm inclined to believe that. An incredible amount of work goes in behind the scenes just to maintain the bullshit we have now, and almost all of the work done by our devs is volunteered and unrewarded.

3) You are not privy to all the information we are. You can argue all day about how you want absolutely no intervention on this server or whatever, but you're ultimately wrong. You aren't arguing from a truly informed position. You don't know what we know. This is, given our current client-base, pretty much as good as it gets. As I said before, we are not perfect, but I think we've all done pretty well over the past 9 months. Especially me. Don't tell anyone, but I'm pretty much the best. I'm the breadwinner baby.

1356128669.0,57,self.Civcraft,1591dx,the story and legality of breaking the vault,87,30,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1591dx/the_story_and_legality_of_breaking_the_vault/,"The legal issues surrounding the ban against my self and others are not complicated. This dicussion has be polluted with absurd amounts of irrelevant information, and no one seems interested in addressing the basic legal questions. I have explained a fraction of the Kafkaesque series of bizarree and seemingly unrelated admin interventions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/157zj8/some_comments_and_questions_for_ttk2/), and I think that was worth doing, but the legal discussion is not as complicated as the possible convoluted sets of reasoning that might be used to justify all the interventions that occured. Firstly I would like to explain how we found the flaw in the vault.

**How we found the flaw in the vault:**


The players involved for the initial finding were Yakman1(me), Richard_T, and TravisSupreme. Anyone else having made claims about how this occured were not present and had not been given the information about how we did it because we were very secretive about the whole thing for weeks. No one else making claims about this actually knows what they are talking about.

**We used world downloader and not x-ray.** We could have just has easily explored the vault with an older download that was publicly distributed [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/v8t4f/download_columbia/?sort=top) The same vulnerability existed then too, go download it and try to find it yourself! Several others commenting in that thread explored the vault in single player at the time, so people claiming that our use is novel on the server are mistaken. ([This player](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/v8t4f/download_columbia/c52budt) was not banned for example. But by the new standard invented by Tactful, he was ""X-raying"".)

We found the flaw where no one else did for months and months by doing several pratice attempts against the vault in order to understand the problem. No one used x-ray during this time and I have no idea why one would even  think that x-ray would help find the path we found. There are plently of crevices of dirt and stone around the bedrock and making out a continuous path like the one we found would be near impossible with X-ray. You would just see a bunch of lines and random patterns everywhere.
We found the tunnel by digging around in a downloaded version of the map in a different server.(We were also trying to get vault design ideas for our own design, a method several regulars had suggested.) By my calculation the vault was weaker from the sides due to the fact that it is thinner on the sides. You have to dig two blocks to walk through, but this is countered by the fact that a large number of people can keep a much higher percent of the total break path in their range, leaving a smaller path for the final 1 person stretch. Because of this, we began checking the sides and quickly saw that the outermost rim of the obsidian overlapped unprotected dirt and bedrock in varios places. The natural course from there was to find the optimal crevice in the dirt and stone that would give us a good head start. We dug out all around, and the head start we found was quite a head start. We found it not when no one else did for 6 months or more not because we did anything unfair or unprecedented, but because we were naive enough to try, and because we actually worked on it rather than accepting defeat.



**The legality:**(please read along [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/13wxdf/codification_of_cheating_policy))

**on cheating:**

These actions are definitely outside of the definition of cheating provided by ttk2 in 1. and 2. above.

There are second hand reports of ttk2 personally allowing the use of world downloader [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/c7k3nxk) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/c7k8frr).

**on precedent:**
No relevant precedent exists in the thread above about banning for use of world downloader in the manner we used it, nor has anyone listed any relevant precedent in the discussions I have seen.
There is precedent for the legality of the use of the world download mod is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/12zt25/is_your_computer_literally_on_fire/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/v8t4f/download_columbia/?sort=top). Of course this may not imply that all uses are legal. It seems that anyone using it is overwhelmingly likely to have gained some information that they could not have gained given where they actually stood in game while the downloading occured. Also the nature of our use was very typical of what the mod tends to be used for on the server as far as I can tell from discussing with several people.(anyone reading please post more specific examples of past uses if possible)
Tactful has claimed that use of world downloader to see any blocks that one was not in a position to see is by definition equivalent to x-ray.

First note that because these methods are not real time, nor do they allow one to ""see through the map"" other than in the very weak sense of breaking blocks that are not broken on the actual server, they are not actually against the rules regardless of whether he classifies them as ""equivalent to x-ray"" or not.

Further, the method we used is far from being ""equivalent to x-ray"" for the following reasons:

1.) X-ray allows one to make a determination about the existence of some occluded condition of interest without any active search.(I think this is not actually true in our case as explained above) Our motivation to dig around came from a conscious exploratory effort, and given the conditions we saw, most players would not have been motived enough to try this in the first place.

2.) X-ray allows one to greatly reduce the search time to find some occluded object of interest, when one is engaged in a search for it.(I my view it wouldn't have helped in this case anyway) Our method did not do this, we had the exact same search problem we would have faced on the server.

3.) If breaking downloaded blocks is the nonrealtime ""functional equivalent"" of X-ray, then rendering screenshots from viewing positions not achievable in-game should be considered the nonrealtime ""functional equivalent"" of free cam, and should also be bannable.(i.e. ban all the people making renders for cheating to peak into their neighbors back yards.)

I do accept the point that in a sense we circumvented snitches by gaining information about the map while avoiding the snitch networks that would have tracked us given we had done the same thing in game.(We did not circumvent citadel in a similar way because the blocks we needed to break to find the tunnel were not actually enforced at all in game.) This is a good point, basically we gathered information about the map through a process that is equivalent to the ingame process *except for the fact that snitches are not triggered in the process.* I agree with this point, but by now we are so far from the letter of the rules or their spirit that it really isn't worth talking about in respect to the ban. This same issue is also involved in all the other well known world downloader use precedents listed above.

Maybe one could make a new rule that normal information gathering while avoiding snitches in this way is against the rules, although I think that would be a horrible rule, and would be against a mountain of usage precedent.

To summarize the legality points:

1.) What we did was not cheating under the rules and had no relevant ban precedent.

2.) There is precendent for several legal uses of world downloader, all of which are overwhelmingly likely to have given the players involved some information that they could not have gained given where they actually stood in game while the downloading occured.

3.) Tactful's legal reasoning for a new rule against using world downloader in this way, if accepted, should not be applied retroactively.

4.) Tactful's simplistic case for functional equivalence to X-ray for producing this new rule does not hold up to scrutiny.

What we did to find what we found was legal. No one found what we found for all these months because no one tried like we tried. We came at the problem without accepting the collective defeatist delusion that the vault can not be broken and the world police cannot be beaten. X-ray would not have solved the problem, and we can all be pretty certain that many people have approached that particular problem with X-ray and failed. What we did is a perfect model of a legitimate success by an underdog, and that is the reason that the community is behind us.

Also please remember that breaking the vault took about 7 hours during which we had to fight off several ""world police"" between 3-4 of us guarding the surface. What we found reduced the required time, but it was still no small feat to survive and complete the 7 hour task.

Meanwhile, our lord *ttk2* has stated that a rift in time has potentially opened, that may reverse the imprisonment of those recently captured. While awaiting trial in The End, Mr. Yeti had this to say: *[THE CLAY GOD IS ANGRY AT MY IMPRISONMENT! THIS IS HIS WRATH!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1esbfl/server_has_crashed_due_to_nbt_tag_error/ca39a3x)*. Mr. Yeti's bounty is said to have been over 20 diamonds.

**Swept Up In A Tide Of Accusations?**

While the FrostyYeti case progresses, one player in particular has seen more than his fair share of accusations. Lehey, a Havenite who has been accused of the murder and minor theft of a man by the name of Firedart, has pleaded CivCraft and her people to see [his side of the story](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1eto11/i_am_being_indefinitely_pearled_because_i_was/). Because it is our duty as unbiased reporters to remain without opinions, what do *you* think of this case? Is he being wrongfully detained, or should he receive his *just deserts*?

**Your Local Weather**

The (-, -) region has seen copious thunderstorms as of late. While locals are thrilled to see improved crop growth, complaints have arisen of lowered FPS, causing clumsy deaths and missteps.

**Foreign Nation Known As *CivilizationCraft* Seeks Retribution**

Diplomats from the land we know as CivilizationCraft have proposed potential solutions to the dilemma regarding the similarity of our nations' names. Citizens from both nations argue for respective [name-changes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1esr0z/if_we_had_to_rename_civcraft_what_would_you_choose/), while some are content with the current, albeit confusing, state of affairs. What is your opinion on this conflict? Are our nations' names too similar, or is it simply a non-issue?

**Was The End Of Our First Millenium Predicted?**

A citizen by the name of *Tambien* has unearthed a [photograph](http://imgur.com/a/fyF28#1) that predicts the approximate date by which our first millenium came to an end. However, *Lunar_Sunrise* claims to be the one who made the prediction, stating: [...the dates were completely random](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1esuta/oh_my_god_look_at_the_caption_on_the_second/ca3kc3y). Is the photograph a genuine prophecy predicting the end of the world, or simply the ramblings of a madman?

The vault at bedrock was 2 layers of DRO with 9 double chests of ""valuables"". The chests/IRO vault towards the surface had 8-10 chests that didn't have as many valuables.

Between 6 stacks of iron blocks, untold amounts of tnt, miscellaneous diamond armor, gold, lapis blocks, somewhere between 27-54 stacks of pearls, potion materials, etc I guess I had at least 300d in damages.

Veterans who have been here for many months more than me didn't know about this method for altering snitch ranges so I have made this handy guide.

The information I am laying out is freely available on the [PreciousStones wiki](http://wiki.sacredlabyrinth.net/index.php/PreciousStones#Cuboid_Fields). The wiki also has a [convenient video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=d7_VVz8fIPY) that will help you understand.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. Place a snitch, then shift-crouch and punch it _with nothing in your hand_. You should be notified that [you have now entered drawing mode](http://i.imgur.com/vkdA2Jn.jpg). The snitch may also turn to glass - this is normal.
1. The snitch now forms one corner of its detection radius. [Look at another block far away from you and left click](http://i.imgur.com/QlGzwpd.jpg). This will set the other corner of the detection area and creating the bounding box for the snitch. The corners are demarked by obsidian, while the borders are glass. pillars.
1. [Point and left click at another point that is outside your bounding box](http://i.imgur.com/z3XdJbo.jpg). The bounding box will expand to fit the new corner that you have created. You can expand the bounding box by a set amount of blocks until it is maxed out. 
1. When you are happy with your new snitch detection radius, shift-crouch and punch the ground with a left click.
1. You will be notified that [the snitch cubiod field is closed](http://i.imgur.com/Pc4b3hw.jpg). A bedrock frame will then [trace](http://i.imgur.com/PAOrNnc.gif) your bounding box.

**Q&amp;A:**

*-Wait a second, snitches are only supposed to cover 11x11x11 cubes. This is ridiculous!*


Yes it is. That is why people have to know about it. You are _only_ limited by the total area that the snitch can take, about 12000 square blocks. This means that if you have a flat rectangular prisms, you can cover [large areas indeed](http://i.imgur.com/L72RAty.jpg).

*-But I thought minecraft would crash when you tried this?*

It still does. There is significant trial and error involved with this method. Standing in the way of the bedrock tracing will crash minecraft. Walking through the glass pillars will sometimes crash minecraft. Placing a corner of the bounding box on a door can crash minecraft. However, the crashes are [worth the end result](http://i.imgur.com/MuGJRdn.jpg).

It's been dead for weeks, but we've been too afraid to admit it. At our height, we had over a hundred ~~active~~ registered players. We hunted down infamous criminals, forged alliances with powerful nations, and made friends across the world. Yet despite all that, we die with a whimper. Trenzalore's leaders fled the nation and allowed the city to die, and Plankton was abandoned overnight without so much of a word. Imperium is also teetering on the brink of abandonment itself. To top it all off, Holy Tree is trying to detach itself from the corpse and is seceding. As the last two councilman in Suilven, we've decided to end it swiftly and cleanly instead of drawing it out any longer. After all, we created it, and we should be the ones to end it.


**So without dragging this farce any further** we've deliberated, and decided it's best to end it now. The High Duke has decided to step down and Suilven has voted to secede alongside Holy Tree. Provided Imperium disbands, Petrania will effectively end. 

Suilven will exist, though not with an active government by any definition. We're going to phase out the government slowly, making sure everything is taken care of and accounted for. What land owners still live there may keep what they've claimed, though they will no longer be protected by the ""government"", or be held to any oaths they made to the nation of Petrania. This also means we will be dismantling the snitch network and transferring all pearls in the vault to a safer location, so it's suggested that everyone move to an actual town/city.

We ask that, out of respect, you not claim or build over the ruins, though nobody will stop you. Cetracey, Cman, and I have yet to decide what we're going to do, though I don't think we're going to be in the business of founding another nation. The community has gone in different directions than us, our friends have left for greener pastures, and the downfall of Petrania has left a bit of a bad taste in our mouths. We'll definitely be back, but when and where is not known.

So yeah, thanks for everything, it's honestly been a total blast. [In the words of Arnold](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1ypn0y32Ac)

But you know where it does make sense? in international politics. 

What we're beginning to see is a disregard for national sovereignty. Both collectivists and individualists should see both how it is morally wrong to attack voluntary groups that enforce laws on their property, and the practical instability we have seen before in places life augusta and the fact that the people that violate sovereignty are soft on the griefers that hurt all of us. 

I think what we must realise that if you do not respect a nations laws, people will not, nor should they, be subject to your laws. let's say hypothetically that a griefer was pearled and given a long sentence. then we see the friends of that griefer (that griefed on 1.0) attack a respected member of the community, why on earth shouldn't I feel that I am not subject to the laws of the griefers town and burn it to the ground? A violation of sovereignty leads to a massive collapse of order. 

essentially, to use the oreo drama as an example, the clay people have demanded that oreo change his laws. If what they did was moral, in what way would an attack on them to force them to release him and change their laws be illegitimate?

And why is it so essential that we respect sovereignty and make sure ? firstly we don't have the nether anymore, so it is harder for people to move around to dampen down instability and wrongs committed by certain groups, experienced hunters like matticus and r3kon, are playing less too.

On the Moral side, we are seeing pearling of people who are merely maintaining law and order, by the law of their towns, and further we are seeing these grief victims that are keeping us safe from people, (who guess what, wont reform, and certainly not without a very long sentence.) being given ""a taste of their own medicine"", when all they've done is good and non aggressive.

~~What we’re asking for is for Oreo to change the law of his land regarding punishment to allow for  more elasticity and less absurdity, for Paranoid’s pearl to be transferred to us while the leaders of Fellowship revise their law and apply a new, fairer punishment for this criminal.~~

~~Now, if this is not acceptable Oreo is also given the chance to have a taste of his own medicine. He may farm two double chests full of pearls to give to us as reparations.~~

Well it turns out that unless you specifically tell it to all it does is spend hours checking over map and then telling you ""hey you have corrupt chunks!"" without fixing them or even telling you where they are. With the addition of the -ac option it actually fixes them, hence the chunks have now been fixed and the fixed region files have been uploaded to the server. 

Furthermore the server will be running Terriancontrol for a bit just so that those chunks regenerate ok. 

All would be well and hunky dory except for one little thing, while waiting for the script to run through all the Minecraft region files on both the backup and the copy from later today we noticed something, the copy from today had 17577 mca files, the copy from this morning has 17059..... looking back at the first generated copy of the map it had only 2887 region files. 

In short something has been generating lone chunks way way out of the world border in the middle of nowhere at a nearly constant rate, more than 577 of them in the span of a few hours. 

The current theory is that a mod of ours is confusing block coordinates with chunk coordinates and is generating these chunks way out in the middle of nowhere when it requests data from them. 

While the server can currently be launched I want to get to the bottom of this before we go on running the server.

That said, I would like to apologize. After an extended period of pent up tension from the HCF invasion, I let myself go off the deep end thinking this was a good idea.

I would also like it known that I participated in a significantly smaller amount of damage and strayed away from combat much more than others in the group.

I hope that my past record of beneficial actions to the server will help cover over this unsightly period in my civcraft history, and I plan on continuing that history of being a well meaning member of the community.

1360543292.0,60,self.Civcraft,189zui,Call for Programmers: New mod FactoryMod to overhaul Civcraft ,71,11,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/189zui/call_for_programmers_new_mod_factorymod_to/,"ttk2 has expressed great enthusiasm at the design for this mod. We need programming help to make it happen. The description of it, along with a description of a proposed mechanic is below. Any questions can come to me via reddit or mumble. I am maximally available to help and advise with this project.

**FactoryMod**

**Introduction**

FactoryMod is intended to fulfil four roles:

1.	Create a “Capital goods” dynamic within minecraft by providing a set of buildable, unmovable tech/production facilities 

2.	Create a more balanced “consumer economy” by providing a tech tree with more inputs and outputs

3.	Balance the added difficulty of mining with natural reinforcement.

4.	Make the tech tree much more diverse and require cooperation and specialisation to efficiently utilise technology.

FactoryMod allows the creation of factories – buildings with a physical presence that produce certain goods. For most of the goods produced, a factory is the only way to produce that good. There is a “tech tree” of higher-level factories that can only be produced with goods from the lower level factories. 

A useful side-effect of FactoryMod is that it removes XP grinding as a key component of the economy (mob grinding will still be useful, but not a key element for all high-tech items).

**Factory categories**

There are four categories of factories, each with their own tech trees. 

**Production Factories** are the most specialised and diverse category of factory. These factories take a set of inputs and convert them to a set of outputs. These factories are the key to making tools, weapons and armour, including all enchanted items.  They require fuel or power to operate. As players move higher on the tech tree the production factories become more and more specialised and expensive.  All Weapons, armour and tools above stone require tech buildings.

**Mining Factories** dig down into the ground and scoop everything up into their chest. Mining factories require fuel or power to operate and can dig deeper into the ground depending on how high tech they are. 

**Power Factories** provide power to the other types of factories, eliminating their need for fuel and speeding their operation. Power factories require fuel of their own. Higher tech power factories can provide power more efficiently and to more facilities.

**Farming Factories** help with the production and processing of food products. Their effectiveness can be increased if they are powered.

**Design Principles**
There are some general principles that guide the design of the factory buildings themselves:

*Diversity* – it is intended that climbing the tech tree for any type of production will require materials from different biomes, necessitating travel and trade.

*Aesthetic* – It is intended that each category of factory have it’s own aesthetic and that each type of building looks unique – however, considerable customisation of appearance is still possible.

*Difficulty* – Higher tech buildings must require production outputs from lower tech buildings – as such, the unique blocks created by lower tech buildings are required in higher tech buildings. More expensive building materials are also required as the tech level increases. 

**(Tentative) In-game Mechanic**
The placing of a Lapis control block next to a chest and furnace triggers the test for whether a factory is created.
 
The chest contents are then examined for the “extra cost” for the factory – these tell the mod which factory to search for and establish it’s orientation.

If an unreinforced factory shaped building with the correct blocks is detected, with a chest, furnace etc in the correct place, the factory is created at that place.

Upon creation, the factory structure is reinforced via citadel to a group no-one is on, and the chest is cleared. 

Every production cycle, the factory structure is checked and the factory stops working if the structure is not there.

Each production cycle, the factory does it's work. This production cycle can be sped up via power supply and also via the presence of a villager.

Power supply is provided by some kind of pipe from a power building to the structure, or via some kind of battery item, or via some wireless mechanism. This is really a matter of what is practicable.

A villager can be attached to the factory. The villager greatly speeds the operation of especially higher tech level buildings but is very hungry! Different structures require different food for their villagers and higher tech ones require multiple types of food/combo foods.

Edit2: Running the script we used last time in verbose mode on the copy of the map we started with this morning hours ago and the copy we have now, we should be able to compare the results to conclude if the issue was never fixed in the first place or being caused during normal operation by some glitch in our software.

* I think that removing the ability to dye sheep would greatly expand the market for dyes.  If we remove this ability, players would have to directly dye wool blocks to color them.

### What this would entail

* This would encourage trade and specialization as players wouldn't simply be able to dye their sheep once and breed them to forever.

* This would increase demand for flowers, ink, bonemeal, lapis and cactus.  The most recent iteration of factory mod does use cactus for an xp recipe so this would actually create an interesting dynamic where certain colors of wool would be worth more than others because of the inherent value or scarcity of the resources used to dye them (Think of the Romans and their oh so expensive and prestigious purple dyes).

* Certain colors of wool may become signs of wealth, such as those requiring harder to obtain and in demand resources.

### Notes

* If we decide to go through with this modification we should allow bonemeal to grow flowers and grass (This was removed in the last Civtest that I played, I don't know if the ability has since been returned to the game or if it is planned in Civcraft 2.0).

* Dye was an important factor in the wealth of the Renaissance cities of Florence (Producer of cloth) and Venice (Importer of dye components from the Ottomans).  

* It would be interesting to see such luxury goods play a role in Civcraft 2.0

* If we go through with this then we would have to disable the spawning of naturally colored sheep.

The following thread is a formal accusation of cheating against players ""Richard_T"", ""kenkurz,"" and Artvmis. Richard_T and kenkurz are accounts owned by the same person, by his own admittance. These three characters are accused of using X-ray or World Downloader as a substitute, or similar means to see through blocks. The evidence is as presented as follows. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Facts**

The following accusation revolves around the breaking into my prison vault. However, it has nothing to do with the actual chests of pearls that the collective HCF worked to break out. In addition the three chests of pearls I had in the vault, there was one(1) hidden dispenser in the vault, removed from the chests of pearls by at minimum 2 DRO in a diagonal and level-changing direction. 

* There were zero pearls in this dispenser when it was broken, and there was never a pearl put inside the dispenser. This is not an excuse of how they could have got the location.

The accused, using the vertical tunnel already dug down to break into the pearl chests, undoubtedly used xray to find the hidden dispenser and dig straight towards it.  The dispenser contained only 1 thing, 1 diamond block. It was the only dispenser in the vault.

* The only blocks broken aside from those to initially get to the pearl chests, were the blocks leading to the dispenser. Nothing else was broken to search for other hidden chests, dispensers, etc... They mined right to it, as if they magically knew it was there. There were two other blocks broken going south, but the reasoning for this was completely fabricated.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Snitch and Image Evidence**

-Snitch Logs-

* http://i.imgur.com/jGrT4.png

&gt; Shows kenkurz ""using"" aka right-clicking while breaking the dispenser.

&gt; Also, importantly, shows kenkurz breaking the DRO over the obsidian, the 1 out of 6 blocks surrounding the dispenser that was not bedrock.

* http://i.imgur.com/rIAxt.png

&gt; Shows Artvmis being the player to actually break the dispenser.(Also using it.)

-Pictures- 

* http://i.imgur.com/AgUIH.png

&gt; This is a picture of how the vault looks after they were done xray raiding the dispenser. 

* http://i.imgur.com/HjUXt.png

&gt; This is what it looked like before it was raided, as in, no indication that anything was there. YET, they dug straight to the hidden dispenser. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion** 

What the hell? Honestly, I see zero explanation or arguments they could give that even attempts to make this not look like xray. 

tl;dr There was 1 dispenser in the vault, they dug straight to it through multiple DRO, and didn't dig in any other direction.

After many hours of thought Citadel was born, more than just a chest protection system, but a method of anti griefing like no other in existance. But it seems i stopped too short in simply making it and writing a guide to the commands. Citadel is different enough from what came before it that I must also provide the state of mind in which it was designed to be used.  

If you take a look at the recent griefing attacks you will find one thing about every attacked city, those buildings built of reinforced blocks are still standing, they can not be burned, they can not be blown up, and to level them requires a griefers greatest enemy, destruction without rage. Buildings in Minecraft are normally easy to build and repair and equally easy to destroy. But citadel changes that it makes griefers take time, so much time to level a building, and with no player yelling in rage motivating that destruction becomes more difficult. 


Stone was not meant to be ""the poor mans lock"" the philosophy of Citadel is not  like LWC , where your protect only the very important. the philosophy of Citadel is to protect **every single block you place** stone is cheap and plentiful, new players are trying to get rid of stacks and stacks of cobble to enter the economy, yet no one is buying, people have yet to realize that citadel is not just for chests and doors like LWC or they would be gobbling up cobble to reinforce every block they place. That's why we have a toggle command so that every block you place can be simply reinforced. 


If you use Citadel when you build when grifers come simply log out, or stand inside your home while they try futility to burn it. this is supposed to simulate the position of defenders, Citadel makes castle walls matter, and act as an advantage. Going out to fight them is to abandon your defenses, Citadel gives defenders an advantage, if they can change the way they think about Minecraft combat enough to take advantage of it. Your walls have a purpose now, build them high and thick give yourself something to defend.  

Citadel was made in part to address the problem that building , and with it destruction, was far too easy I could not simply take away the ability to build as simply as you would in normal Minecraft so the solution was reinforcement . There is no feeling of satisfaction destroying in an hour the hovel it took a player 10 minutes to build. 


So it seems I have , in typical style for myself, surmounted the difficult obstacles to my goal, but forgotten the simple lynch pin of explaining the idea behind it. I hope this gives you new insight into Citadel, and griefers a challenge which they have never encountered before.

This is a tale about freedom on the 4th of July. This story will give you a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart. There is no drama. There is no circlejerk. There is only justice. 


Our story begins in Orion roughly two days ago when a group of griefers heavily griefed Orion. Lava poured from the skies, stone reinforced stone lined the streets, and a 1 layer DRO vault was left in the streets. This group, the self-named ""Butter Brigade"", bragged about having 15 members. They claimed to be from HCF, and said they were here to break out the BK. They announced intentions of pearling the leaders of every leader in CivCraft to Ron Jeremy their e-peens. Here is a list of the involved accounts:

* legitlazyboy
* StingrayJT
* ColtVonHugenDong
* Look_Out
* FuturizeHandgun
* monkeyfatzer
* Aryios
* sirdemonic3
* EldooCide (Claims to be their leader)
* yoIyo
* EpicPoodle (Recent discovery, refer to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft_Orion/comments/1holun/i_did_some_informationscouting_after_being/) thread. This account was not known at the time of these events.)


When this all started, nobody had any clue what their intentions were, however. Once the damage of the first wave was done and the Orion citizens managed to clear most of it, they struck again. This time pearling numerous Orion officials (Itaqi, firewarlord) and citizens. They were placed in a 6-7 (Someone else may remember better than I) layer DRO vault, with an additional 5 in SRO. A number of people came to help, including Shamrock Jones of The Metro and other Orion citizens. However, the group came back. Legitlazyboy, Aryios, FuturizeHandgun and yoIyo came from the west and pearled the remaining populace and Shamrock Jones, placing them in the vault. 


**Where the story gets especially interesting:**

After pearling the folks in Orion, the force went North to Minas Minas in hopes of breaking into their vault to free the BK. 9/10 of them went (EldooCipe staying behind in Orion, he supposedly knew nothing of this plan). As the group of ruffians picked away at the DRO, a force amassed in Solis. Approximations lie at 20 people in total being involved on our side. Representatives were present from almost every city in the -,-. Solis made up a majority of the force and provided hospitality to several travelers by giving them food or spare pearls. Additionally, combatants arrived hailing from a diverse range of sources, including Minas Minas, Kappi, Freedom, Orion, Haven, and Carson. Some people had no swords, some no pearls, and some no prot at all.  In a spirit of comradery, combatants donated armour, XP, pearls and potions to one another in preparation for the fight. It was a moment of intense anticipation - first one of worry, but as numbers grew, everybody in that market place knew we were going to kick ass, the only question was how much. After grouping in Solis's market (or so I assume it was) for quite some time, the force left the market and ran towards the vault in Minas Minas. 


Never had 16 bit shiny teal-coloured avatars fill me with so much pride. We sprinted in waves towards the vault, knowing if we'd go in all at once they'd be scared shitless and run. Once the first got there, things went down fast. Almost all of the Butter Brigade surfaced simultaneously, their numbers spanning the minimap and our fields of view. A battle ensued for a short time before the griefers retreated. Their side's first to be pearled was Aryios, minutes into the fight. After being combat-tagged, a knockback sword (Mine) threw him into a ravine , where he promptly died. I don't think he even got a hit off on anybody. 


After this, things get iffy. The griefers set off in all sorts of different directions to get away. Some groups went East after a griefer and lost the trail. Some went South after legitlazyboy, who was carrying the pearls of a Minas Minas resident. That resident (RavianGale, please correct me if I'm wrong) was pearled shortly after bravely placing lava in the only exit from the vault, helping damage the fuckers before the fight even started. Hats off to her. Her Prison Pearl broadcasts played their role in the chase, giving legitlazyboy's location to everybody in the mumble. For reasons I don't quite know, (This is a story for those involved to share themselves) gongshow, while originally accompanied by others, was left alone to face legitlazyboy and was killed, after which point legitlazyboy outran the remaining forces and escaped back to his vault in Orion. 


Additionally pearled was StingrayJT, who died in pursuit of a Metro combatant when he was attacked by Drayok22 of Haven. yoIyo was also killed by Dray shortly after, though not pearled due to a lack of pearls on Dray's end. (There are additional casualties on both sides that I do not know much about - please share your sides of the story and I will be sure to edit them in!).


Meanwhile, in Orion, EldooCipe (the supposed leader of the group) logged back on, at which point adambrooks killed, but didn't pearl him. The fight changed focus after that. Those who were still up for a chase headed towards Orion, some staying behind to store what pearls we had. Yet another wave of attacks came across Orion when the retreating forces dropped off the pearls of the casualties from The Metro - those who had still been digging at the DRO vault there found their spots lava-griefed when they logged back in. 


Without ppbroadcasts, the location of the remaining griefers was lost, and attention was diverted to freeing those pearled. Aside from those coming down from the Metro, nearby citizens from Orion and Haven came to help their fallen allies. Eff picks were shared and passed around, and food was provided for those that made the long way south through the seemingly endless mountain ranges that divide The Metropolis from the Orion-Haven area. Finally, shortly after midnight, the DR chest was broken and the victims were free. 


Warm cuddly feelings were had by all, with hoorays and huzzahs filling the chat by Orion and the mumble channels. Residents from Solis, Minas Minas, and Orion popped up, happy to be free. The remaining group huddled together to share a p potion together as the brief celebration went on. And somewhere nearby, watching us somehow, [a cold congratulations was passed on to the survivors.](http://imgur.com/fBOHmqi)

The assault took place after a drunken reckless HCF player by the name of Camxd stumbled into the city spreading havoc on local citizens. He was eventually pearled but not without causing an extensive amount of damages which included punching random workers in the face, breaking into random houses, and an unverified report of public urination. Camxd's drunken rage wasn't limited to the city of Tigerstaden as verified reports from Haven showed him spray painting obscene images upon innocent unarmed sheep and livestock. His pearling in Tigerstaden was considered an act of self-defense while Comrade Gordge saw it as a blatant attack on the HCF. In a statement, he explains: ""Yes, I know we may have 1,2,....maybe 3 elephants in the room but, maybe if we just killed all those who notice the elephants, then no one will notice any elephants at all!"". With such a warp sense of logic under the delusional efforts of Comrade Gordge, who knows how long his cronies can keep up such a fruitless campaign of destruction.





The workers of Buenos Aires have begun breaking ground on the new theater in the main city center. The size of which may even rival the theater in Mt. Augusta itself if all goes accordingly. A variety of planned events are being prepared including a political rally, a convention, public debates, and a theater production on ""The Life of The Glorious Leader"" done through interpretive dance!





Have some HCF members begun to reform? Some say yes while others insist that such an idea remains fictitious. Comrade Spurion would insist that he has in fact turned towards reconstruction as other members of the HCF remain focus on destruction. Aside from the human rights crisis that Spurion created via his concentration camp, he has been continuing the construction of a new 0,0 Nether hub. If HCF comrades like Spurion have truly reformed, perhaps he should take the next step of pearling others within his rank who have proven destructive and unhelpful for the workers of Civcraft.

1) I found a DRO box at 0,0 and broke an iron chest inside of it, thinking that a greifer put it in the street after killing someone. This was Virtue's and I'm sorry.

2) Second, why I am in the end. I'll tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth here.

Bored out of my mind at 0,0 as there were no griefers to kill, I went to Aurora to fight some of the crime happening there. It took a bit, but I arrived to put out a fire on a dock. Suddenly, my friend [Not gonna say who] messaged me and told me to get the hell out of there. I looked around and spotted a figure in diamond armor on a rooftop. I went to leave, but discovered that 5 people in plain diamond armor had blocked all of the exits. Now I can only imagine what those griefers were thinking, but probably something along the lines of ""OHEY Lok, a dimin armur scrub, we can take hm."" Aw hell no, son. I whipped out my sharp III fire II sword, Brisingr (May his soul rest in piece) and proceded to beat the shit out of 4 of them, before the fifth took out a lava bucket and weakened me, until beheading me with the final blow.

It took a while, but I was able to return to Aurora with iron armor, sword, and a few pots. I discovered a player in diamond armor where I died, so, my moronic mind assuming it was one of the murderers, decided to murder him.

Oopsydaisy.

So you would probably all remember the part where about 5 guys in prot/plain diamond armor chased me down and pearled me. I wanted to say sorry for attacking the wrong party and am willing to pay reps for the damage I caused on your armor, and I hope *somebody* finds Brisingr and brings him back home. I can take Questions/comments/death threats for thirty minutes before I leave for the weekend.

1359230626.0,54,self.Civcraft,17bvss,The ultimate newb FAQ for new players!,61,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17bvss/the_ultimate_newb_faq_for_new_players/,"**I cannot join the server. What is wrong with this?**

There are many reason why you could not join the server. Make sure you entered the right address in your Minecraft client. The server address is *untamedears.com*. One of the various Minecraft service might be down which would explain why you cannot join. In order to connect to a server, various Minecraft services need to be online. Check [this page](http://xpaw.ru/mcstatus/) out to find out the status of the various Minecraft services. You might have the wrong Minecraft client version. Sometimes, Civcraft is not running on the latest version of the Minecraft client for various reasons. Check out the sidebar of /r/Civcraft to see which version you need.

The server might also be full. In that case, you should get an explicit message about it. You just need to retry later.

**I just joined and I keep on dying of hunger. Where do you find food?**

The first thing you should do is get yourself a wood sword and kill a few animals. If you cannot find animals, a sure way to find food is to kill a few spider to get 2 strings and make a fishing rod to get fish. Alternatively, you can ask in local chat for someone to give you food. This might involve some risks as some jerks like to kill random new players.

**I just joined and I cannot find anyone around. Where is everyone? How do I find my way around?**

The world map is pretty big. Many people hang out in towns or cities. The [Nether Map](http://www.hpoom.co.uk/CivCraft/map.php) gives you Nether and Overworld coordinates for many know places when you hover on that place. You can push F3 to see your own coordinates when you are in the Minecraft client. Many places are or have been deserted. To find out the active places, check out /r/Civcraft for the ones which were recently mentioned. The last time this document was revised, Mt. Augusta and Nine were some of the active places around.

**I just joined. Where is the best place for me to get started?**

There is no definitive answer to that question. If you joined with a few friends, group with them and work with them. Collaborating with others make it easier to get started. You could join one of the many cities, towns or other groups around if you are alone. The best thing you could do is join the mumble server, see which places have people in it and talk with those people. Most of them are friendly and they will most likely invite you to join them if you ask them.

Alternatively, you could do the hermit start. You could find a nice isolated vanilla chunk (see the next question for what is a vanilla chunk) and mine your way to get wealth.

**I just joined and I cannot find ores in the ground. I keep digging but I only see stone around. Where can I find iron, diamonds and all the other ores?**

You are most likely in a mineral vein chunk. There are two kind of chunks on Civcraft, mineral vein and vanilla.

Mineral vein is a program that was ran on the original map to change the ore distribution. It removes all the ores from the ground and place veins of different ore in a compact region but all sparsely separated from each others. Places where you dig and you can only find cobblestone/stone are places where mineral vein was ran on. You still get a chance to find a vein full of the same ore, but those are rare.

Mineral vein was not able to transform the whole map for different reasons. That left some chunks in their natural state something we call vanilla chunks. Vanilla chunks are mostly away from 0,0. They have the same ore distribution as the original Minecraft which means you can find pretty much every ore when you dig at level ~12.

I suggest you move somewhere else where you can find vanilla chunks. Chunks around Mt. Augusta should be vanilla chunks.

**How do I protect my stuff? Why can't I break some blocks?**

Civcraft includes a modification called Citadel that helps protect your stuff from other people and it deter you from breaking other people stuff. You can use materials to reinforce existing blocks or blocks you place around. You can also lock doors, chests, furnaces and other utility blocks with Citadel using the same commands. The reinforced blocks will eventually break after a certain amount of breaks. [This infographic](http://i.imgur.com/BnlL2.jpg) is a good introduction to this mod. For more information, have a look at [the wiki page](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=mods:citadel) for this mod.

**Some people seem to know where I am, where I was and what I was doing? How does it work? What is a snitch?**

Civcraft includes a modification called PreciousStone. The snitch is the only part of that modification that is included. Snitches are vanilla jukeboxes that were simply placed around and that act somewhat like local presence detector. They provide their owner with live alert if someone pass by and they record actions that were performed by others close by the snitch.

To make a snitch, just create a jukebox and place it around. You might want to hide it and protect it with Citadel as well because you will lose its features if it is removed. Once it is placed, it will send you real-time text message in your chat when someone else is around the snitch. You can also check it its log by pointing in the direction of your snitch and typing */ps snitch*. For more information, check [the wiki page](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=mods:preciousstones) for this mod.

**How can I use and create shops?**

Civcraft includes a modification called Physical Shop. It enables the creation of shops where people can trade stuff without having to be online or having to be at the same place at the same time. Shops can be easily recognized by having a sign above a chest with an item name or item id between square brackets as the first line written on the sign. You can buy or sell items to the shops by having that item in your hand and right-clicking on the sign.

You will want to protect your shops with Citadel. Make sure you reinforce the block behind your sign, the sign and the chest. If you use a single chest, make sure it is not possible for someone else to place a second chest next to yours because he might be able to steal your stuff by reinforcing his own chest part.

To create your own shop, place a sign above a chest with an item name or item id between square brackets as the first line and the buy/sell prices below. For all details about currency units and the syntax for the sell/buy lines, see [the wiki page](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=mods:physicalshop) about this mod.

**Where did people get emeralds? Is it possible to store experience?**

Civcraft includes a modification called BottleO. Is can be used to store experience in exp bottles, emeralds or emerald blocks. [This infographic](http://imgur.com/ldQyZ) explains everything you need to know about it.

**I keep hearing people talk about pearling others. What is this? How can I enforce rules on others?**
**I am in the end world and I am not able to leave it. What happened to me?**

Civcraft includes a modification called PrisonPearl. It enables players to imprison other players in the end. [This infographic](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) is a good introduction to this mod. You can check out [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/149p1f/what_is_pearling_exactly/c7b5oku) for all other related FAQ about PrisonPearl.

**I keep hearing people talk about vaults. What is this? How can I secure pearls?**

A vault is simply a highly reinforced construction mainly used to store pearls. People surround their pearl (or other items) containers with a large amount of diamond reinforced obsidian (DRO). Since DRO is the best possible protection you can have for anything, it usually take much time and effort to break into. Vaults are often located at rock bottom and they often have a pyramid like shape for efficient resource usage. The amount of resources needed to make bigger and bigger vaults follows an exponential curve making it incredibly hard to create huge ones or to make existing ones larger.

**What is the world size?**

The world is limited to around a 15000 block radius circle around 0,0 in each dimensions.

**Would you have any other suggestions for a new player?**

Yes. You might want to install and configure various client-side modifications to have a pleasurable experience. Here are a few of them that I highly suggest:

- [OptiFine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-b6-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/): Better Minecraft speed/farther possible distance view.
- [Rei's Minimap](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-147-jan10-reis-minimap-v32-06/): Terrain mini map and waypoints.
- [RadarBro](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1040810-146-radarbro-gui-mobplayer-radar/): Players radar.
- [ArmorStatusHUD](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1114612-147-bspkrs-mods-armorstatushud-v14-directionhud-v18-statuseffecthud-v17/): On screen armour and tools status (Mostly for PVP).
- [StatusEffectHUD](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1114612-147-bspkrs-mods-armorstatushud-v14-directionhud-v18-statuseffecthud-v17/): On screen status effects and remaining time (Mostly for PVP).

Installation and configuration is left as an exercise to the reader.

**Where can I get more information about X?**

Have a look a the /r/Civcraft sidebar. It is the section to the right in this page. It includes links to pretty much everything you might want to know about the game. Alternatively, you can find all the information on this game by having a look or searching the archives of /r/Civcraft and following every links.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1359233927.0,,,True,t3_17bvss,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17bvss/the_ultimate_newb_faq_for_new_players/,

In Civcraft anyone can keep themselves fed effortlessly by spamming bonemeal in a tiny growing room under their house. In real life people who wander into wilderness with no food risk starving; in Civcraft all you need is three tilled dirt blocks along a river and some bonemeal.

If

1) Edible plants required direct sunlight, 

2) Edible plants and animals grew much slower, and

3) Bonemeal was less powerful
 
Then farms would go from being tiny, unimportant patches to huge carefully guarded fields. Just how large these fields are is easily adjusted, halving the growth speed doubles the area of farmland needed to sustain the population. It wouldn't result in much more work after the initial setup since the same amount of wheat blocks get harvested either way, just encourage trading and make the landscape more interesting.

To all of you who have supported us in the past, thank you. If you helped pay for the server we run on now the server you paid for will be setup to rent our virtual machines to help support Civcraft in the future and provide a steady, if small, income of its own. But to do that we first need to get over the hump and get our new hardware. We have been throwing a few ideas around lately some of them are below, please note they become more crazy as they go down. 



* Custom capes: This seems to be the most widely supported, but sadly it also seems to require a client mod right now, leaving us to wait for the new mod API. Once we could the plan would be to sell capes as a per month subscription for a small fee where the user would get a cape of their choosing.


* Civcraft t-shirt: Matticus-Rex owns a small shirt business, if we could get a large enough order to justify his costs we could get a custom designed shirt where 50% of the order pays for the product and the other %50 goes to the new server.


* Reserved slots: A set of slots over the regular limit will be auctioned off to the highest bidder every month, if the server is full players who have bought the slot for that month may then still login and play as normal. Ideally owners would be able to set a number of people able to use this slot, although only one of them could use it at a time. Also the slot would be transferable in-game, allowing enterprising users to buy or sell the slot for in game resources. 



* Admin Crimes : For $5000 give a buyer OP for 30 seconds before resetting the map and removing their OP status. 


* The Obvious : This is the most unlikely option of them all, it involves using [this link](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=support)",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1342652205.0,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_wqdey,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/wqdey/we_require_additional_gold/,moderator

He accuses me of knowing that Icee is infact prereq and that he has 100% proof of that.

Considering I don't even know who prereq is I find this unbelievable. I wasn't even here for HCF invasion and know nothing about this.

When asked to see the evidence surprisingly there was no answer given.......I find it funny how these admins ban me who had no knowledge of this yet people like Positronic who as Ezziot stated in his thread knew far more than I still roams free.

Would love an explanation about this, funny how not a few weeks ago I was pearled in game for so called ""secret evidence""

I would love to know why you think I have spoken to him in mumble when at the initial vault break attempt we made he was in mumble but not speaking, you can actually see from the logs that he communicated in game via dill_weasel and he relayed all of his messages. I have never even heard him speak so, nice try.
The sole interactions I have had with Ice is passing on info to him when he asked me for it with regard to people he has been hunting, and he attempted to get into my vault to kill cliff and that is it. I have never talked or met pre-req but ok.......I'm sure you have such great evidence. Your previous admin actions shows how you are 100% infallible.

And this link was TTK's response in a PM

Wonderful team.

Dread explains quite clearing in Ezziots thread + numerous others the events leading up to the ban so I'm still waiting for that to apply here. Quite comical how you focus on me, when there are 20 + HCF players now on this server who are far more likely to of known something than myself, and even more than that who simply play civcraft who have had their assumptions of him for awhile.

You have 0 evidence to prove I have known anything about his true identity, and we both know it. But can't expect people who play on civcraft to have a unbiased view when it comes to this stuff I guess.

Have fun with my friends while I'm gone.

---------------------------

    ok everyone its time to get started

    First of all I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to come here

    I am sure our hosting company is giving our bandwith graphs a very confused look right now

    More than a year ago now Civcraft first game online an I cant say I ever expected to end up here

    With 200+ of my strangest friends

    I chose the firt for this meeting because its important to me, it was the first city I lived in

    so long ago, you know some of the reinforcements on the walls here are still mine?

    untouched after more than a year

    If you walk downstairs and find the farm you will see the hole where my prison once was

    someone in our esteemed audience today, MC is FTW was the one to imprison me himeself

    while it was situations like this that eventually lead to me steping down from playing

    it never stopped me from forming an attachment to this place

    20,000

    more than 20,000 people have joined and played Civcraft on this map

    20,000 stories, each with their own importance places and expiriences

    Somehow it makes the 14gigs of the server map feel much heavier

    and seem so much larger

    But I could have never gotten here without the support of my players

    you know, looking at the subreddit traffic stats for /r/Civcraft you will find somthing strange

    through thick and thin, server up server down, 2000 people view the subreddit every day

    its nearly impossibly constant, it never wavers below that number. It is as much the commitment

    of the players as it is mine that we can continue to run this server

    people say that Civcraft shows the worst in people, that if you just look at what people do

    you will find somthing worthwhile

    but I say Civcraft shows the best of people, because it is here.

    the effort and commitment shown in keeping the server alive, updated, and improved has been

    an incredible testimate to all of you

    I am saying goodby to the rift and this map along with all of you, as someone who was once a player

    going forwards I will no longer be a player, but it is my goal to never let the ""ivory tower""

    become a literall situation

    If civcraft is to continue to thrive

    the admins need to stay close to the game, not live so far away they can not even tell what

    the players are doing anymore

    I hope to spend more time listening to all of you in mumble and continue at least trying to

    keep up with the subreddit

And... this is where AFKGC kicked me... :(

I'll continue this from videos/livestreams...

Going from this, I think having bone meal not work on trees, and trees growing much slower would be an interesting dynamic for Civ2.0.

In light of over a year of Civcraft History and many many recent events I think it is time we all have a relevant and necessary discussion as Civcraftians:

+ Does no rules really mean no rules? Or is this an outline from the admin team that allows us to chart our collective destiny as players?

+ Is *griefing* (killing/pearling innocents, stealing, and unjust destruction of public and private property) something that we think is acceptable behavior in our experiment? 

+ If griefing is indeed never acceptable is it then time we recognize that the people who are against us may not only be outsiders but rather specific individuals who have slipped in among us? Enemies within.  

+ What should be done when we catch both new and old members of the community who carry out these terrible and harmful acts? 

We are over a year into this experiment and I for one want to see a server culture where laws are respected. A community where more nations and cities can grow and prosper with out fear of oppression from criminals and/or griefers. 

Most people I speak with want to see a Civcraft Experiment where tyranny and oppression are snuffed out before it can take root.

The power to change our community is ultimately in our own hands and we need only to reject fear and move towards what we desire most.

**tl;dr: I'm quitting Civcraft; wall of text below.**

As all things come to pass, so does my time on Civcraft. After pretty much wasting two years of university on Minecraft in general, addicted to a few servers here and there (with the latest being Civcraft), it is time for me to call it quits and to focus on my private life, on getting my BA and on getting some work practice abroad (hopefully in Canada).

But before I finally confine myself to [the crypt in my home city](http://i.imgur.com/MGwq7p9.png) (still being built), I would like to present my... will of sorts.

I hereby transfer the ownership of:

I) **[The Waterfront district](http://i.imgur.com/ZceYmMs.jpg)** in [Rapture](https://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=cities:rapture) along with **The Grand Library of Rapture** to the **[Maester Alliance](http://www.reddit.com/r/MaesterAlliance)** to do with as they see fit, however the two main floors of the Library must remain accessible to the public for free.

II) **[My Columbian house](http://i.imgur.com/OCqUANd.png)**, an architectural landmark (in the sense that it has kept the same look for nearly a year) of [Columbia](https://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=cities:city_of_columbia), to **Dr_Oracle**, a long-time friend, to do with as he sees fit, but without architecturally altering the building itself, aside from necessary repairs to restore its original condition.

III) The **[Memorial Park](http://imgur.com/W39H211,TOBwB29#0)** and the park of **[FUCK HOMESTEADING](http://i.imgur.com/wgSj1F5.png)** in Columbia to **Dr_Oracle** to do with as he sees fit, but without architecturally altering the **Memorial Park**, aside from necessary repairs to restore its original condition.

IV) My [empty plot](http://i.imgur.com/ndhAu.jpg) in Columbia to **Dr_Oracle**, to do with as he sees fit, literally.

V) The **[Columbian station](http://i.imgur.com/74UxuST.png)** of the **Rapture-Columbia** overland rail line to **jacejace**, to do with as he sees fit, especially since he owns the rail line itself anyway.

VI) The **Rapture half** of the **Caracas-Rapture** overland rail line to **jacejace**, to do with as he sees fit.

And here follows a list of donations I have made, to rid myself of the burden of virtual possessions:

I) *65*d to the **[Public Works](http://www.reddit.com/r/civcraftpublicworks)**.

II) 64d to the **Maester Alliance**.

III) 64d to the **[Road Crew](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivcraftRoads)**.

IV) 64d to the restoration of **[Vanaheimr](https://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=cities:vanaheimr)**.

V) 64d to **To Be Disclosed**.

VI) Some ghast tears and other lesser valuables to an old friend originally from Cunshan and, hence, as she is now part of the commune, to **[Chiapas](https://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=cities:chiapas)**.

VII) All of my historically notable world files downloaded of various places from the server map via **WorldDownloader** *solely* to the **Maester Alliance** for research purposes, as the Agora University [showed absolutely no interest in them](http://i.imgur.com/Zu3yOlL.png) and [didn't bother replying](http://i.imgur.com/rDjGsV4.png). However, I reserve the right to distribute said files further to individual researchers who show enough interest and potential to actually have a use for them.

VIII) Various historic screenshots, if I ever get around to uploading them, to the **Maester Alliance**.


**To conclude**

It's been fun, but *tiring*, and I would like to thank *all* the countless people that have helped me with various projects in the game or who have otherwise made the experience an enjoyable one. I would especially like to thank [fellow Rapturians](http://i.imgur.com/ol1D6IT.jpg), who I am honored to have befriended, for tolerating my *mania grandiosa* regarding architecture and how I mostly just came up with grand visions that never reached fruition. I hope I *at least* managed to get Rapture on the map with the Grand Library I designed and built.

If I should get some time to, I might break out from my casket to breathe fresh air once in a blue moon, but I will cease all other ingame activities once I am done with the final preparations. I might also be able to help historians by writing my personal account of the Golden Days of Columbia and the complete history of Rapture up until my sort-of death, since that can be done where ever as long as I have a surface and something to write with.

A final thank you goes to **Dossier5** for unknowingly letting me, jacejace and williamjf subtly take control of Rapture and *re*found it as something better than his original vision of *Little Columbia*.

And a revelation for some oldies who actually took the time to read this wall of text:

Yes, I was in the Ruby clan together with [MineCraftIsFTW](http://i.imgur.com/YwRtOLb.png), [Joshua97367](http://i.imgur.com/TNlTKDT.png) and others on the Amethyst Blade server before quitting it in favour of Civcraft.  If they hadn't mentioned the server in a Skype conversation, I probably wouldn't have found found Civcraft in the first place. However, after about a week or two of playing here, I took a completely different route than Joshua and MC and started a much more peaceful life of developing the city of Rapture. Having also [discovered the famed VoxelBox server earlier](http://voxelwiki.com/minecraft/Marcus_Flaminius), PVP just, well, *wasn't that fun anymore*.

""Minas Minas"" translates to ""Tower of Towers"". Or more loosely, ""The tower above all towers"". It also is a wonderful pun on its location in the -,- quadrant.

To start, some sketches: 

Isometric: http://screencast.com/t/abis8bF9NK

Side: http://screencast.com/t/ohb6qkt9H

top: http://screencast.com/t/DjGqiValFH

Dimensions:

- Base of outer city (between the 2 outer walls) is Y:10
- Each ""step"" is 30 tall. (putting the the top at 220)
- outer wall radius is 250m, with the sunken valley extending another 80m radius to the cliffs raising to natural ground level.
- Built on world Border

Design Inspirations:

- Outer structure is a tall stacked castle inspired by: [Minas Tirith](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100116234231/lotr/images/e/e4/Minas_Tirith.jpg)

- Inside the outer structure will be an internal city inspired by [Erebor from The Hobbit
](http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/the-lonely-mountain-erebor---movie-version/) (sorry for the poor pictures, seems it is hard to find screenshots from the movie.

- architectural style with have certain elven flairs to call to Gondolin's elven heritage, inspiration: [Rivendell](http://www.freewebs.com/rivendelle/rivendell.jpg)

- Major design requirements is defensibility and home field advantage.

- Single building ""palette"" but a unique diverse design. I really love this particular [lego model](http://i.imgur.com/j8aGQgv.jpg). No building is the same, yet have a common style.

To embark on such an incredibly epic project... It will require many people.

I am first looking for:

- a group of experienced architects. (we will be playing around on a creative server quite a bit)
- Diggers to dig in a vanilla area (and keep what they find)
- Wall builders to start building the structure. (especially people experienced at technical building, especially laying out perfect circles).

I will also be looking to have discussions with leaders across the server to determine ways Gondolin can be a place they feel comfortable participating in as an external entity (past just building an embassy).

This is going to be a huge effort, and there will be a million questions raised and answered during its construction and later habitation.

Despite the vivid foreign like name that would attract anyone hoping for a tropical like paradise, the realities are anything but. For personal security reasons, we'll be naming the traveling victim under the name Bob. Comrade Bob told investigators that despite the promises of plenty, the so called resort is actually an internment camp that would make Rios Montt himself filled with envy! The operator of this camp is none other than the mentally unstable comrade known as Mr. Twiggy. Our Glorious Leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Buenos Aires has condemned the action as ""Not subtle enough"" and ""Too obvious for even the slowest of comrades"". Promises of peace and work from such HCF members can never be trusted and should always be ignored unless they're formally approved by the infallible nature of our Glorious Leader!




The sound of cobble being uplifted from the ground has become well known in Buenos Aires. Workers have described it as ""loud"", ""uplifting"", and ""a sound of progress""! Thanks to the engineering work of the ABRAXAS company under the Industrial Minister, Bmchapman, the factory has now begun the work of doubling cobble as well as smoothstone production! Unlike the fake promises of the HCF, the city of Buenos Aires promises true work for the average worker. Furthermore, all new factory workers can get a comfortable free living quarter right next to the machinery itself so that they themselves get the luxury of hearing the deafening sound of progress first hand. Do your patriotic duty for the Workers Party by joining the workforce today!




Finally, a structure has begun to emerge from the sea off the coast of Buenos Aires for all to see. For the longest time, workers walking on the coastal road questioned what exactly they were looking at. Some speculated a new hammer and sickle statue while others thought it would be a new dark structure that would block the sun itself. Such speculations are half right and only now has the true face of the structure reveal itself. Why, it's none other than a massive replica of our Glorious Leader himself! His patriotic presence blocks out the sun while at the same time, brightens the patriotic fervor over the horizon of city center with his gloriously iconic black suit. The greatness of the statue has all but eliminated any opposition from within the city thanks to a sophisticated system of cameras and experimental radio waves  that help to identify potential traitors before they even begin their traitorous activities!

your old ways. My actions in this manner were calculated to ensure your reformation was a true one.

It rewards the individualist, after all being designed as a singleplayer game, it rewards those who settle down where they spawn, providing no real advantage to exploring aside from the nether and, in regards to PvP combat has created an ugly, boring and repetitive system rewarding the fastest internet speed and pointer finger above the best marksman or largest army.

Civcraft has done an excellent job in ironing out the majority of these inherent flaws. We have varying terrain, reason to travel, realisticbiomes for biome specific items, the ore vein system, etc. We have harsher food growing conditions and factories to foster communities being built and to punish the single pioneer. 

What remains unchanged, however, is combat. Combat is still vastly overpowered for some and still dependent largely on equipment. Are you in a combat situation? Don't have prot IV? Log out. 

My suggestion to fix this final problem would be to remove military enchantments altogether and to give all bows some slight improvements. This could be in the form of a default enchantment, slowness debuff, etc. Additionally, require all armors beyond leather (or iron?) be built in a factory, and all weapons beyond stone (or iron?) be constructed in a factory. 

I recognize that this is an unpopular opinion, and an idea that couldn't be implemented until a civtest/3.0.

Some other thoughts: the EXP market would crash. Enchanted pickaxe prices would go through the roof. Experience, to retain some of its usefulness could replace charcoal in factories and coal in vaults. Really though, I hate that EXP has become the end-all commodity. Anyone who wants to make more than just chump change is in the experience/enchanted goods business. If goods were more varied I think we'd have a more interesting economy.

Diamond armor is now limited to those who have/have access to the incredibly expensive diamond armor factories. What this means is that those who have access can now set the prices for diamond armor as they see fit. This also means that iron armor will have a real place in military conflicts, with large legions of ironclad soldiers actually having a chance against the wealthiest elite. 

Another thing that has always bothered me is that the wealthiest players on civcraft generally have Prot IV. If the best they could have is plain ol' diamond I think we would see lot of more interesting highway robberies, murder during travel and the real need for bodyguards.

Again, this can't be implemented now and I'm not asking for it to be -- I'm merely describing what I think could be a very interesting change to some future iteration of the game.

With this optimized or persistence disabled it is likely we could top 200 without too much effort, there have been a lot of suggestions and discussion but no one has actually stepped in and gotten the code optimized, it either needs to be done very very quickly or I will have to shutdown the server until it is or accept a balance without persistence, it went from taking up 100ms in the main thread to 2,000+ ms in the main thread in the span of just three days, this is not survivable or somthing that can wait. 

The existing codebase is [here](https://github.com/Namrufus/RealisticBiomes) and further details including performance logs can be found on the Google group for devlopers. 

Edit: The question of the moment is if we can disable persistence without disastrous consequences, and if so what sort of config.yml would I need for that? 

Edit1: It seems Erocs has identified the problem, now its matter of coding a solution. To quote him

&gt;If NoLagg is right, it's caused by PlantManager.unloadBatch. This looks to be a synchronous task. Even if it was asynchronous, it looks like the writeLock is global for plant state and is locked when all of the chunks queued up for unload are processed. In this case it would block PlantManager.add() reverting it back to synchronous.

&gt;If everything related to the writeLock is run on the server's main thread or as a synchronous task, it can be removed. For chunk unloads, it looks like the offending task runs every unload_batch_period server ticks, by default 300 (15 seconds). That's a long time to queue up chunks to unload. Maybe manually take control of the task scheduling instead of having it a repeating task. Have it check the time before it starts unloading chunks. Once it has taken more than a couple milliseconds to run, have it break the loop and schedule itself to run again in 2 or 3 ticks. Once the chunksToUnload queue is empty have it schedule itself to run again in 300 ticks. This way chunk unloads occur slowly instead of hammering the system all at once if there were a very large number of chunks queued over the 15 seconds.

I know some of the ideas around enchantments have already discussed, but there are other mechanics to be discussed.

The first that I think would revolutionize combat and empower groups of people, would be the removal of ALL pearl teleportation. 

Things pearls prevent:

- As long as you have pearls, it is impossible to get caught out of position. Get stuck in a hole? engage early? get jumped? just pearl away 
- surrounding an enemy is impossible. at anytime they can teleport 60 blocks in any direction.
- Engagements become erratic and random to quickly. People pearl off and disappear, particularly with our low view distance.
- A single person can ""alliojuke"" all day long a group of people and never get caught. People should be able to corner and trap an individual

Disabling pearls would buff:

- Groups. You can effectively surround a lone target
- Bows. Walls and towers ACTUALLY MATTER. Shoot away, embrace your knockback.
- getting stuck in a hole SUCKS. You are gonna die.
- slowness, poison, fire. You can't just teleport away, you are probably in trouble without a speed II.
- Speed II, this is much more relevant when someone can't teleport every time you get close.
- Archers not in full prot. A line of guys in prot can hold the front while archers are more protected in the back. People have to run through, not just teleport over.
- Strategic engagement and positioning. People have to think of their escape route... how they enter in a building, how they plan to get out. If you get your squad cornered in a tough part of town, it has consequences.
- Armor Weights more meaningful *(Antonius)*

Disadvantages of Disabling teleportation:

- harder to engage/disengage large groups when you get in trouble
- combat will result in one of the combatants dying more often, more so when compared to how many that escape now.
- closing on petty griefers (those without pearls) will be a little harder. Harder to catch people before log off.
- Getting away is to easy *(Joshua)*
- possibly crushes the pearl market *(Antonius)*

Anything else people can think to contribute? I will add them to this post as people propose them.

We appreciate that there has already been a fair amount said on this, but hope now to clear up mischaracterizations and omissions in the record and offer a bit of our perspective.

------------------------------------

**The initial visit by serverError404**

On the afternoon of the 23rd, serverError404 initiated unwanted contact with bananafone31 as [seen here](http://i.imgur.com/LjtOhCD.png). It should have ended there. Unfortunately, it did not.

We would like to remind people that AnCraPzPReZaDeNT was recently banned in part due to a case brought against him by Valenti. AnCraPzPReZaDeNT himself made it known that advocates on his behalf were eager to grief Valenti for our involvement, as [seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18xihn/appeal_to_unban_ojd_and_ancrapzprezadent_not_a/c8j4v5s). serverError404 has been an outspoken backer of AnCraPz (evidenced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18xihn/appeal_to_unban_ojd_and_ancrapzprezadent_not_a) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18pqkl/unban_ancrapzprezadent_and_ojd)), as is his right. However, the day after AnCraPz's ban was announced, serverError404 took it upon himself to join the LSIF mumble channel and begin harassing bananafone31 there, calling her a cunt and railing about the perceived 'unfairness' of the ban.

And so, when serverError404 showed up in town shortly after messaging bananafone31, we feel it was a reasonable assumption that he was not coming with good intentions. This is corroborated by a post of blueavenue's [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1952rf/i_am_still_being_held_indefinitely_by_valenti/c8kvbo2):
&gt;""You knew you were going to get pearled. I was in the Batcave when you were discussing going to Valenti and creating a Klan Outpost outside the city. You knew they would pearl you, stop trying to make yourself a martyr, virtually everyone sees through it.""

Further, he arrived wearing a [KKK skin](http://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/683056/kkk-steve), which he is [still wearing as of this writing](http://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftSkins/serverError404.png). That alone would put him in violation of Valenti law, and also corroborates blueavenue's quote regarding serverError404's intentions in coming to our town.

It has been suggested that serverError404 only trespassed in chat radius and bananafone31 chased him down and killed him without giving him time to respond to her instruction to leave. Snitch evidence does not back that up.

[Here is a log of serverError404's entry to town, including bananafone31's request for him to leave](http://i.imgur.com/LMRNKnv.png). Two more points of data come directly from [serverError404's report against bananafone31](http://imgur.com/gkV0BzV,IAxpqf2#0).

[This is an illustration of the locations of pings](http://makeagif.com/media/2-26-2013/o6mSkL.gif).

[This video may help put the actual buildings into context](http://youtu.be/vTMb0LkTq40). Keep in mind that a) this is simply a direct path point-to-point, which serverError404 very likely did not follow exactly; b) serverError404 by his own account had time to pause and type ""me?""; and c) per bananafone31, he was climbing on top of her house before coming to the door, presumably to find a way inside.

**The conclusions from our perspective:**

1) serverError404 has a history of harassment towards bananafone31

2) serverError404's messaging of bananafone31 was not random, but was meant to incite reaction

3) serverError404's arrival at Valenti was not accidental; he certainly was aware that he would not be a warmly-welcomed guest due to his history with bananafone31 and support of AnCraPzPReZaDeNT; and he came with the intent to start trouble

4) serverError404 did not merely hang in chat radius, but instead tresspassed directly in Valenti proper and bananafone31's property in particular

5) serverError404 was asked to leave, but continued on in a direct line to bananafone31

and finally 6) the killing and subsequent pearling of serverError404 was justified per Valenti law, the extent of harassment, and lack of faith in serverError404's ability to respond to any other action.

------------------------------------------------

**A show of force**

Very soon after the pearling, friends and supporters of serverError404 arrived and [made their presence and intent known](http://imgur.com/a/dUmbu).

Meanwhile, [serverError404](http://i.imgur.com/qnV6tft.png) continued his harassment, even as his squad of first responders swarmed into town.

[A short scuffle broke out](http://imgur.com/a/HRPNS); it eventually petered out and Valenti was left at peace for a couple of hours.

------------------------------------------------

**The griefing of Valenti**

[whosnick's helpfully-supplied pictures from the first night of griefing](http://imgur.com/a/BGf1M)

On February 23rd a large group of invaders came to Valenti. Some focused on the vault, some just came to check out what their friends were doing while putting on a show of force, and some others griefed. After struggling with the pearl vault for a few hours, they retreated. [On February 24th, they returned for a repeat session](http://imgur.com/a/jRufQ), this time successfully freeing serverError404. It's been claimed over and over again that whosnick is the one who griefed Valenti and the others present were just there for serverError404. The pictures speak for themselves.

------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

Valenti is not particularly interested in reparations from the above individuals. We are, however, interested in the culture of Civcraft. Valenti is historically a pacifistic, rather isolationist town. In spite of peoples' prejudices against us, we are not advocating for SRS-style restrictions world-wide. Nonetheless, we encourage the server community to look over the above evidence, consider the nature of the people involved, and decide in which kind of world you want to exist. Don't allow hate and harassment to flourish under threat of lava reprisals, or you'll soon have a pristine landscape full of bigots and unimaginative trolls.

-----------------------------------------------

**Thanks**

The server does have a large body of truly good people, and we'd like to acknowledge several of them now. The following players showed up during the aftermath with many putting in several hours of work to clear Valenti of lava, water floods, swastikas, and other blights. There are most certainly some accidental omissions from this list; so many people came through at different hours that listing them all seems nearly impossible.

1366904558.0,51,self.Civcraft,1d36vt,Regarding My Earlier Post,68,17,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1d36vt/regarding_my_earlier_post/,"I've spent the past day thinking about what I should do, and I've come to the decision that I could go public with what I heard last night.  This will likely kill my ""friendship"" with the players involved and probably get me griefed, but I feel that for the good of the server I should come clean.  While I do not have direct evidence backing up what I've heard, I hope that you believe that my word carries enough weight. 

Last night I was in Josh's private Mumble talking to him and Tutter (we play Mount &amp; Blade and shit together).  NJPalms entered the channel and was noticeably pissed off.  He started talking about how much he hated the Adkins of the server and that if they freed the people pearled by Hamster he was going to do something stupid.  

Palms said that, if the admins committed what he considered admin crimz, he was going to quit the server and go out with a bang.  His idea?  The ultimate DRO grief.  Palms estimated his wealth at around 10 stacks of diamond blocks, or 90 stacks of DRO.  He said that he was going to coat Civcraft with DRO.  He planned to DRO over all of the portals and fuck the nether roads.  He mentioned adding onto Berge's tower with DRO.  He said that he wanted to fill 0,0 nether side with DRO to fuck with Stonato.  Josh got on board with this plan and offered to give some of his considerable wealth (at least 15 stacks of diamond blocks) to Palms' project.

Eagles them entered the channel and they stopped talking about it for a minute.  Then, Eagles mentioned something about fuck this server and they started talking about DRO griefing again. Eagles floated the idea of turning all of  purchasing a massive amount of iron with the diamonds in order to maximize the amount of obsidian breaks people would have to do to clean up.  They calculated that they could get about 7 times the breaks of obsidian if they bought iron.  

Eagles and Palms then started to talk about why and how they'd do this.  They we mad that the server no longer stood for what they believed was right and were pissed off at the ""children"" who were against them.  They decided that they'd either demoralize these ""children"" so much that they quit or force a a map reset.  They specifically singled out Stonato, imagining how upset he'd be if all of his work at 0,0 was reset or ruined with their griefing.  

Their plan to implement the griefing was to originally do it all in one might, but after further thought they decided it would be more devastating to do it over the course of multiple nights.  First they'd DRO off all of the portals they could, portal trapping and player unlucky enough to go through them.  Them they'd do some serious griefing to the nether. People would leave their cities and find their portal blocked. They'd get out of the portals and find the roads griefed. They'd go to the railways and find them covered in IRO.  The obsidian would be placed in rings around the portals in cities at a block above the ground in order to impede movement the most.  They talked about the best way to prevent people from stair casing over the obsidian.  

They figured that if the did this over the course of multiple nights that on the first day the entire server would rally together to clean up the damage.  They figured that after the first day, they wouldn't clean up all of the grief but they'd clean up a good chunk of it.  Then, Palms and crew would strike again and again. The server would be less enthusiastic cleaning up the grief every day.  Eventually they would give up and either quit or force the admins to reset the map.  

Throughout this conversation I was trying to tell them it was a stupid idea and they wouldn't listen.  I tried to explain to Palms and Eagles that this plan was worse than what the HcF initially did and based on similar reasoning.  They wouldn't listen to me and eventually I got so pissed about their bullshit that I left the channel and went to go do something else.  

I don't know what to do about this.  I feel that this isn't enough evidence against them to pearl them, but I don't want them to be able to do this.  Civcraft, I leave it up to you to deal with the people involved in this plotting (Josh, Eagles, NJPalms, Suiridax and Whosnick) as you see fit.  Be aware though that in addition to this griefing they also talked about updating Josh's copy of the infamous JHoward's client and using it.  Josh also admitted to using JHoward's on CivPVP and Civcraft in the past.  

This kind of planning is unacceptable.  It is not OK to tuck a server used by over a thousand people just because your idiocy is no longer supported.  

**TL;DR** NJPalms, Eaglesrock, Josh and Suiridax are very bad people   ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_1d36vt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1d36vt/regarding_my_earlier_post/,

We've had quite the exciting last couple of weeks, haven't we? There's a lot of talk of who we are and what we should be doing. In the midst of it all are some folks who are just out to make everyone's day a little better and we think it'd be nice if they got some help.
  

   I'm here today to announce the formation of **[Civcraft's Public Works](http://reddit.com/r/civcraftpublicworks)** - a project and organization dedicated to the upkeep and creation of roads, the distribution of public goods such as food, the mapping of Civcraft's ever-changing topography, the chronicling of Civcraft's rich history, and much more!  **With the support of such institutions as the University of Agora and folks such as road crew legend hpoom, Public Works aims to build a better Civcraft.**


*You don't have to be a saint to place a block*. We are **non-exclusionary** and non-profit (though I think we're all benefiting from these projects). Anyone is welcome to submit requests or volunteer for the Public Works, though criminals will most likely work on non-material intensive projects. We do not hunt griefers and we do not take sides, CivBounty is already an excellent resource for some very effective claimsmen. We are here to build and to benefit us all.


-------------------

* From explorer to alchemist, all volunteers are welcome, you'd be surprised how you can help!

* Please donate. Contact your city representative today and ask them to set up a Public Works donation box in your settlement!

* We accept requests for roads, mapping, video renders, and more!

* Please join us over at /r/Civcraftpublicworks and submit requests/volunteer to make this server better for yourself and everyone.  

* Jailers and victims, please consider allowing reparations through volunteer work.

It was a quiet evening on civcraft as I logged on in Mount Augusta. Recently I had just viewed the posts detailing a conflict brewing over New Kowloon, an Augustan suburb, wanting to secede. The conversation was mostly normal. I yelled out over the chat that I had seen the events with New Kowloon and that it seemed a revolution was brewing. Another citizen yelled out ""Revolution? What revolution?"". The local chat was suddenly overtaken by people calling out about revolution and how it was or wasn't justified. A lone citizen started calling for an end to the current government, and then it caught on.

I was quickly making my way to my house on corner of the town and the situation was going down quickly. People were popping out of their houses and marching to the courthouse. Representatives of the government were calling for calm and peace, and ZombieLenin, an outspoken citizen, seemed to be leading the charge against the government, calling for lava griefings and a burning of the courthouse.  I was back at my street and was ready with diamond sword  to secede from Mount Augusta and protect the Algerian Neighborhood if central authority fell apart. An apparent pearling of CSimplify seemed to aggravate things, and calls were being made to overthrow the current government and institute a communist government.

From what I could tell on the chat while hiding in my appartment was that the protesters had marched to the courthouse but had been routed. Calls were being made to avoid griefing and lava. Things seemed to be calming down. I called a lone wanderer wandering outside into my apartment, giving him some food and telling him to stay safe in here, that the city was in revolt.

Then, all of a sudden, reports of revolutionaries killing pro-government players downtown erupted, and the jungle suddenly found itself on fire as violence erupted again. ZombieLenin seemed to be losing control of his revolutionaries and the city appeared strained beyond it's breaking point. 


**EDIT** 
Mount Augusta seems to be on the breaking point of falling apart. Different sectors, including Geckolubber street, Algerian Neighborhood, and others are threatening to secede officially if central authority or combat. More murders have occurred on top of the Tower of Nine and a fire has started. Player naeemt has been quoted as telling everyone in the city that can to evacuate as the political situation continues to spiral out of control

**EDIT 2**
Pro-government player Ave3ng3d7x has been quoted as saying ""people of mumble, I wish evacuation, help me"". Geckolubber street is in the process of complete secession as rue d'Alger neighborhood is in the process of temporary independence.

**EDIT3**
Clear parties have been established in what can now be called an outright civil war: The LSIF have formed a conglomerate against the current government and have now attacked members of the current government. Anti-government members include brmj, ZombieLenin, lifetime0fwar, and leader OfcourseIam. Government forces include Stuckinarut, kikariska, and TeaJizzle.

**EDIT4**
The first major government offensive has started as military moves into the street to retake seceded areas. RON_PAUL_2012 has been reported as pearling players. Businesses and homes downtown have been looted and public buildings have been set alight as the night brakes on the city riddled with public instability

**EDIT5**
Following the government offensive, most of the city has been retaken and restored under government control. Geckolubber street and Rue d'Alger have been re-incorporated peacefully after talks with RON_PAUL and other government officials, and primary leaders behind the revolution have been pearled and will be brought to justice.

**EDIT6**
The Augustan situation has returned to normal and the army continues to patrol the streets as the last whispers of the revolution are dying away. Parts of the city have been damaged and some red flags remain, hinting at the action and turmoil that was occurring just a few hours ago. As most of the North American players go to bed, the city falls under peaceful rule once again. The original issues behind the revolution, however, have not yet been addressed.

If ttk2 is providing a home (and worse, a server) to known griefers with claims against them, why can't ttk2 be directly held responsible for aiding said griefer?

I understand his gimmick, but if I ran a server where players ran around spewing lava buckets everywhere, I know I would be held partially responsible and pearled. What allows ttk2 to avoid responsibility for allowing griefers with claims against them to connect? Everyone knows that claims are entirely objective!

Why didn't ttk2 ban the gimmick brigade for griefing? I was gimmick brigade scum and I'm still playing. ttk2 is literally aiding and abetting griefers and must be pearled. ttk2's position of letting players connect to this server and grief without banning them is [literally violating my nap.](http://i.imgur.com/TWeVsjV.png) Therefore, **I declare war** on ttk2 for being entirely neutral in our petty affairs.

Is there any way to download the Civcraft 1.0 Map? To be able to visit it on singleplayer?

 I was interested because I wanted to be able to visit my town and store it somewhere as I liked what I built lol. 
Also I wanted to see towns I have not seen properly, and to see all the secret vaults and bases that were hidden. 
One of the coolest things I had seen on the first map was the island with the ""No Trespassing pearling on sight"" signs, i was always wondering what was inside that castle.

-------

* We have a new login queue plugin, how it works is simple, if you try to join and the server is full you are added to a queue list. To keep your place in the queue try to rejoin in *no less than* 10 seconds and *no more than* a minute. If you try and spam join the plugin will kick you down in the queue. If you don't try and rejoin at least once per minute you will lose your spot in the queue. You will get an update of your position every time you connect. For those interested in helping [here](https://github.com/igotyou/DynCap) is the source. 

* I hate to say I told you so, but the server survive the night with the 175 player cap, leading me to think that guess A + guess C where correct. Rapid joins caused some memory use if connection throttle was on, this caused the slow memory growth we saw. Then the flash crashes were caused by variable load factors, sudden movement and overloading of the server could cause memory use to balloon and cause a crash. 

* There are two ways to increase the player cap, optimization of software and throwing better hardware at the problem, we tried throwing better hardware at the problem and we went from 100 to 160-180, just with recent optimizations we went from 125 to 200-240 with worse hardware! Its obvious that software currently has higher returns when it comes to performance than new hardware does. 

* Increased hostile mob spawn cap from 10 to 20 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* Remember this map is officially in testing until the 26th and we do reserve the right to reset things if there are very serious problems. As we discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1eouvk/anyone_feel_like_resources_are_scarce_enough/ca2b21v) so far I not convinced that there are any problems of that scale. If Civcraft is to be about emergent gameplay we can not throw in the towel at the first sign of an outcome we did not expect. 



* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make? 



* I would like to thank all of you, thank you for your help and support, have fun.

1368627285.0,45,self.Civcraft,1edstk,[NEW USERS] Welcome to Civcraft Part Two - Joining Civilization,50,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1edstk/new_users_welcome_to_civcraft_part_two_joining/,"Ahoy new users! If you haven't yet, [**read Part One**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1edqgr/new_users_welcome_to_civcraft_part_one_the_basics/). 

Now that you know the basics of how Civcraft functions, it's time to learn a little bit more about how the *people* function. This part is much less of a science and will likely be up for debate, but we'll keep as simple (and unbiased) as possible. 

---

**Getting Started**

When you first wake up in Civcraft, you'll have spawned in a random location. After obtaining some food, start walking. Keep walking and wandering until you come to a community. It may take a while, do not lose faith. Be patient and keep looking. It's a big map. 

When you discover a community, be wary. Call out from beyond their borders to make sure it is okay that you enter. While 99% of the time it will be okay and they will welcome you, *some* communities are private and consider trespassing a crime. And you don't want to get to get sent to The End on your first day. 

Once they let you in, see what there is to help with. By proving your worth you may be able to earn a free house plot, apartment, or get permission to pay for an empty plot of land. Each community functions differently and has different laws. Talk to the members. [**Download MumbleChat**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmumble.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;ei=KpOTUZQKiKDiBPnXgMAK&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEMLF_ScM7a0dRb5n4cjr5jYqm1A&amp;sig2=g1Os1PEOPiUJHGxdTdvl7Q&amp;bvm=bv.46471029,d.bGE) and talk with them via voice while you play. Really immerse yourself in your new community and home. Thrive as a team. 

---

**Learning Skills**

This is what separates the standout players from the crowd. Learn a skill that you enjoy in the game. Practice it and master it and do it en masse. Do you like enchanting? Become your regions master enchanter and you will find yourself becoming a very valuable player. Do you like collecting items? Save up and start a general store. Like exploring? Start a delivery company that will send you to the furthest ends of the map. 

---

**Conflict**

There will probably come a time when you are involved in a conflict within Civcraft. Hopefully this will be a small issue, but it is an exciting server. There is everything from petty thievery to full scale wars. 

If someone commits a crime against you, such as breaking into your house, your best bet is to contact your government. If your government is one that enforces their own laws, they will work with you to capture the transgressor and bring them to justice (whether through repayment, prison time, or some other arrangement). If your government does not enforce laws, but instead allows citizens themselves to enforce justice, you can be advised as to what punishment is acceptable for the crime. 

It is important to note that some communities do not recognize a formal state, but prefer to coexist as anarchists. If you are not familiar with AnarchoCapitalist philosophies, this may be a tad confusing however the simplest way to explain it is that they see themselves simply as individuals cooperating, and not as a formally organized state. These users follow something called the Non Aggression Principle (NAP) and if you use force against them (the term force can be defined in different ways) they will exert their own justice. Sometimes they work together for this cause, which can create hard-to-define conflict however the best way to avoid this is to avoid aggression against these communities. 

It is wise to always communicate with your community leaders if crime has occurred. Witchhunts and vigilante justice can cause messy situations that are hard to solve without getting third parties involved. It is best to avoid those situations as they can stress international relations. 

---

**Citizen of the World**

Once you have established yourself, learned a trade, and gathered some wealth, many people decide to explore more of Civcraft and establish homes in other cities. This is highly encouraged, but always check with the local laws regarding citizenship. Some nations require you to give up former affiliations before joining (those these are smaller in number, most communities welcome anyone). 

There *will* be a series of major roads that link the biggest communities. These will make it easy to travel, but exploring the wilderness and smaller communities can be just as rewarding.

Its just a collection of ideas and code, I just happen to run the 'official' implementation and lead further development. There has never been any reason why someone can not simply replicate Civcraft's config and run their own server just like it. But so far not a single person ever has. 

As much as I am going to try to bring Civcraft as you knew it back online as soon as possible there is another option. 

I propose the creation and distribution of a Civcraft kit. Nothing more than a .zip filled with the server.jar, all the plugins and configuration files ready to roll. All anyone ever has to do is download a file, and double click on the 'run civcraft' .sh or .bat and they are hosting a Civcraft server with everything from plugins to configuration setup and ready to roll.

Most of these servers are likely to be small, but that hardly breaks the experiment. They can DDOS one server, maybe two, but what about ten, twenty, a hundred? 

Simple standards of quality and a default distributed ban list should help to keep the servers somewhat unified.

My simple proposal would be to remove the teleportation ability from ender pearls, and keep their other characteristics, such as for PrisonPearl.

**Aurora** (/r/AgoraCity)




**Fellowship** (/r/CivcraftFellowship)




**Haven** (/r/CivHaven)

Many plugins are being discussed and coded as you guys circlejerk over Civcraft 2.0, least to say ""we are working on it."" Fifthly, that sounds horrible. Back on topic however, we will announce official aspects of Civcraft 2.0 when we are ready.

**TL|DR:** Admins and developers are madly working on creating a new and better Civcraft. It could be months until Civcraft 2.0 happens or it could be in a day. At this point, we just don't know. Because of this uncertainty, we would like discussion of 2.0 kept to a minimal.

It's me NukeJay of Agora, and I've been elected for the ""Secretary of Education"" position one week ago, and I've since been working on getting the New Agora State University (NASU) started.

As many of you might know, the university has been planned for ages now, but we've always had our rebounds, prohibiting us from getting the university finally up and running, earliest having the AlKaowni dro'ing our university buildings (twice) and latest having been the ddos-attack.

Anyways, what I was trying to say, I managed most of the logistics, and I'm pretty confident, that the university is ready to run in less than 3-4 weeks.

However, before I make empty promises, what I need to know is, are people actually interested in the university?

Would any of you guys be willing to dedicate some of your time to preparing and holding lectures for a group of inquisitive civcraftians?

And more important of all, are you people interested in attending classes in an ingame university?

Our main effort isn't only teaching, we are also working mapping all of our quadrant and eventually all of the others too, and are working on having the largest library in all civcraft.

None of my or anybody else's efforts matter, if none of you is willing to be taught about politics, mc mechanics or the history of civcraft.

__

Our current departments are:

-History

-Law

-Economic Science

-Political &amp; Social Sciences

-English (which is rather a huge book club)

-Geography (which mainly focuses on mapping civcraft)

-Chemistry / Medicine

-Engineering / Ingame Mechanics (mainly redstone wiring)

__

Many of you may think this is a bad time, with the new HCF drama.

If you don't think you're ready for a university now, please let me know, when you are!

__

The reaction I get determines, whether or not I will put additional effort into setting up the university.

If I get the reaction, I hoped I would, you can be sure, there will be a new application thread up in the next few days!

Please, tell me your opinions and be honest!

No hat tricks, nothing fancy, just a lot of block breaks and a lot of time, money, or both. With that in mind we have previously disallowed things like using the trap door glitch to access vaults as they defeated the primary purpose of Citadel with respect to PrisonPearl, today we are presented with a new style of vault construction that is also based on a rather simple trick that also defeats most of the purpose of PrisonPearl. 

While I tend to like encouraging cleverness in this case I am afraid I have to discourage it, the trick is 'legitimate' in that it does not require a modified client or anything else defined as cheating but it took a direct tutorial to figure out for even our most experienced moderators. As we did with the trap door glitch we are going to work on a modification to make this particular method of vault creation impossible, in the meantime you are all advised to evacuate whatever valuables you have used it to store. This could be online as soon as Sunday morning depending on various factors, although the details of its operation will be announced the day before in the changelog I do suggest going ahead and moving things out. 

As a note on confidentiality and methods of the current administration. The senior admins are the only ones with direct access to most information and what is known by the lower level admins is kept strictly controlled. TeaJizzle had been working with the group of players who had been attempting to free NJpalms by discovering the trick used to make the vault for the past two weeks at my encouragement. He has not seen the video sent to administration nor has the method been repeated to him, nor any of the other ""Minion"" level admins. I am taking the time to say this to make something clear, my goal with the lower level admins is that they remain a part of the community, although not active or pivotal, they should be around and seem accessible, I do not want the joke of the Ivory Tower of Admin Crimes to become literal, if none of us play we risk becoming too detached from the community. TeaJizzle was doing his job working with the players and keeping me informed of their progress and the situation in general.

1) Networking Expert: Someone familiar with network engineering, preferably with a history of network-based software design.

2) OpenGL Expert: Someone familiar with OpenGL, preferably with a history or familiarisation with its usage in 3D game engines.

Both of these pearls were removed from Mount Augusta and have been taken to vaults. Augustan Law has not been followed in any way. 

You have consistantly said that the one thing - _the one thing_ - that you were absolutely going to do was to respect the legal processes of cities. This was a large part of your public justification for making war on the ""world police"" in the first place; they caught griefers and didn't submit them to Augustan justice. 

So I ask: will the pearls be returned to Augusta pending either a trial or an extradition hearing according to law? 

If you aren't prepared to do this, then you'll be failing to deliver on the the __one and only__ thing you promised would be 'better' under this new authoritarian regime.

The leader of this coalition, Foofed and fellow Anarcho-Capitalists, had the numbers on their side against the heavily outnumbered HCF members. The problem became apparent as leaders of the Coalitions were found reading Command Structures For Dummies upside down while scratching their head over the concept of organization. In the ensuing standoff, the entirety of the Coalition fortified under the HCF base and instead of making a direct attack, the confused Ancaps decided to take a wait and see approach. Members of the LSIF and other leftist organizations became increasingly frustrated by the lack of reaction along with the favoritism among the Ancap cronies. 



The standoff that originally seemed to be within the Coalition's favor soon turned as HCF members multiplied from a mere 8 to over 20 soldiers during the hour staring competition. The 30 or so comrades of the Coalition soon realized that they could no longer hold back such a large force and in the ensuing confusion, made a full scale retreat. A spokesman of the Buenos Aires Defense Ministry explains, ""Our comrades ran the fastest during the strategic withdrawal and I personally think that should count for something"".




Among the ranks of the HCF, they celebrated by screaming homophobic slurs, screaming ""U Mad?"", and proclaiming that no one could lift. We could not get a clear statement from the leadership as many were too busy running around with lava buckets shouting, ""Burn everything!"".

This is my unbiased input.",72,25,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1580zw/as_a_player_from_the_hcfactions_group_this_is_my/,"Let me start off with some backstory of the server we came from. The server is called ""HCFactions"" and it is a breeding ground for killers, pvpers, strategists, infiltrators, and sometimes griefers. The server has been up for nearly a year and from this server we gave birth to many stories. Stories of brave fighters, skilled one man tanks, underdog factions, and espionage. 

We were all noobs at first trying to figure out how the server worked. Over time, we slowly understood how the server worked. As we slowly understood so did our pvp skill. [MrTwiggy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUxdg6P9IM8) was one of our best pvpers. As is the killers you call [ApacheBlitz and Russian_Roulette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAzsolKHJfc). We had [faction vs faction wars](http://youtu.be/OPK-6bcio0o). 

Suffice to say, we are all trained fighters and skilled in the art of group pvp.

So inn the beginning there were two groups of us that originally joined CivCraft. There is the group that you called ""Baddies"" which consisted of players who had no longer played on that server for a long time and ""HCFactions"" or Gordge's group. At first it was just the Baddies that joined CivCraft and the original purpose was to wreak havoc because of a 3rd group ""MrTwiggys Group"", we thought he was just going to kill anyone and everyone. 

But that was because we failed to understand how the server worked at first. Afterwards, we saw how politics worked and how civilizations were created. So we tried taking a step back and trying to understand the server and planned carefully. This resulted in us attempting to make reparations and stop targeting the innocents. 

Yet you all still continued to spread propaganda about us. We did our best to repay our innocent victims and try to defend the ones not involved. After the breaking of foofeds vault, we thought it would create a great server event. It would spice up the routines you guys were so used too. Our plan was to take down the current world power and install a new power. We haven't planned that far yet but trust me, it will be fun.

The war will continue but for different reasons now. We plan on fighting back against the admins for the unjust bans that were served after foofeds vault. I've talked to quite a few of you and you've talked to quite a few of us. We aren't savages out to grief the server, we are here to pvp and to bring in a new political ideology. We weren't planning to grief and roll through towns destroying all your hard work. We like building too and we're quite good at it. Like this [base](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UefnTp-ByJk&amp;feature=youtu.be) or this [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEWQCs_8GtA). 

I'll write more tomorrow but I have work. See you all on the flipside.

lol. instant downvotes. Anyways, I'd like to thank you guys. If it it wasnt for you guys everyone from hcfactions would still be enemies. It's crazy seeing old enemies and people who hated eachother work together for one cause. We are friends now which is unusual but it is neat at the same time. This event brought enemies together and made us friends. So for that, I thank you. It might mot mean anything to you civcrafters but I never thought I would see the day where baddies/lannister/strawhats/absolution are all working together.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1356092550.0,,,True,t3_1580zw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1580zw/as_a_player_from_the_hcfactions_group_this_is_my/,

Civcraft seemed like one big country with various cities rather than one big continent with various city-states, and what's the point of that?

If we want to become a server simulating society, let's do that then instead of just pretending. I ask the cities in 2.0 to either come up with a military or be able to pay for mercenaries. And I also ask that the members of the World Police who still want to go around catching griefers to not do it for free anymore. Make a town or person pay for the service.

My hope for 2.0 with the food and minerals being more scarce and the lack of a nether highway will allow for more ""natural"" conflict between factions on the server.

This brings us to the reason I'm sharing this story. clowny321 and Ezziot (a previously banned player who was then pardoned and put on probation) had been working together fairly closely, so as part of my investigation I asked Ezziot about him and hinted at the investigation, since Ezziot had been helpful to me before by ratting people out to save himself. Ezziot came up with a complex story about how clowny321 couldn't be a previously-banned player because it was his friend from Steam that he introduced to the game, etc. His delivery of this story was suspicious, but I let it go. Then this happened.

Ezziot is now banned. Were he not on probation, it would be a two-week temporary ban, but that's not the case. When I tell you people not to knowingly associate with banned players, I mean it. Making up stories to cover for your friends is just going to get you in trouble.

Evidence of glitch: http://imgur.com/a/B7GzM


in first screenshot (by kuk_kuk) you can see me with running particles and standing still, in other 3 sreenshots you can see my minecraft and evidence i am not using nodus but vanilla client with radarbro and rei minimap installed, as you can see only others can see sprinting particles but you cant, **if that is not enough evidence i can try to recreate it again and film it with kuk_kuk or somebody else**


recreating that glitch is very simple, somebody has to pearl you, you have to run for at least 1-2 seconds and than he has to summon you back (while you are still running), same thing happened to me, i was summoned by friends of mcfluffykins while i was running in end, i found how to recreate this glitch after googling on **[this site](http://www.minecraftsurvivalgames.com/threads/sprint-particles-glitch-fix.23573/)**

&gt;I just tried this by getting pearled myself.
When I was summoned I walked around and chemistry35 saw particles on my feet after I moved around.
You are correct.
The interesting point is that you personally do not see sprint particles on your feet, however the other players in multiplayer do see those particles.

[I just wrote this](https://civcraft.org/doku.php/conflicts2/turkobloodwar) to demonstrate what we should all be doing on the wiki. This is a server about history, but we seem to have little of it documented besides maybe in some news posts that are buried.

Do you have a town? **MAKE A PAGE FOR IT**

Have a federation or nation? A company? A griefer group? An ideology? **MAKE A PAGE FOR IT**

Had a large event that created some drama? **MAKE A PAGE FOR IT** 

Does your town not have a flag or crest **MAKE ONE**

Is there some political drama going on in your area? **MAKE A PAGE FOR IT**


We have templates on the wiki for a reason, it's so you all can document the happens of you, your town, your nation, your organisation. Hell even make a wiki page for yourself, if you think you're important.

Remember nothing is 'not important enough' for the wiki. The wiki isn't this place to put only the BIGGEST of the BEST events. Put whatever the hell you want. 

I'm sure plenty of towns can record attacks on their towns, or drama with nearby cities, even if it's ongoing. A town like Lio could record all the attacks on their town. Someone could even make a page for the recent drama concerning New Leningrad. Someone can keep track of Griefer groups and document what they've done and their history, give their organisation a name even. 

So go write wiki articles and let your nationalism, narcissism and exaggerated truths out.

1368624940.0,45,self.Civcraft,1edqgr,[NEW USERS] Welcome to Civcraft Part One - The Basics,49,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1edqgr/new_users_welcome_to_civcraft_part_one_the_basics/,"Ahoy there! 

So you're interested in joining us for Civcraft 2.0? Well, as someone who has been around the block since the Early Days, I've put together a two part guide to get you situated. The first part is about the server and the game itself, the second part is about the culture and advice on how to get involved in game. 

Note: See the sidebar for server addresses and other information!

---

**What is Civcraft?**

Officially, Civcraft is meant to be an experiment to simulate civilization within a Minecraft server. Instead of a creative server or a survival server with mods and rules and tiers of membership, Civcraft is something different. Towns, villages and cities spring up around the globe, each establishing their own laws and culture. And these laws actually matter, because there are no moderators besides the users themselves. 

---

**Self Moderation**

If a city forms and establishes wealth, they have the means to enforce their laws through the [**imprisonment feature, pearling.**](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) Regularly, criminals will be caught and sent to The End, which acts as a prison on Civcraft. They cannot escape until their captors release them or their friends steal the pearl from their captors and release them. 

So there is a way to punish criminals, but is there a way to avoid annoying destruction of property? Yes, in fact there is a robust feature called [**Citadel**](http://i.imgur.com/kHJVX.jpg) that allows you to reinforce everything you build as well as lock chests, doors and redstone constructions. So, if you reinforce an object, it would take several (currently 25-1,800 depending on the material) breaks before the block is actually destroyed. So, even if you use the cheapest reinforcements available, it would still take a minimum of 50 block breaks to open up a 2x1 hole to break into a house. 

---

**Realistic Map**

To help us achieve the simulation of society that we are aiming for, the administrators will be using a realistic map for the coming reset (the last map was live for over a year, so don't worry about resets). 

What this means is that there will be biomes you've never seen before, biomes that are VERY VERY big. Oceans that take a LOT of time to cross, mountains that actually provide a challenge, and landscapes more beautiful than any vanilla generation. The goal is to make travelling hard (the nether is disabled), but also to promote trade between cities. How will we promote trade though?

Well, with the [**Realistic Biomes**](https://github.com/Namrufus/RealisticBiomes/wiki) plugin, certain crops only grow in certain biomes. Oh and that custom map I mentioned? Ore generates at less than 1/4th the normal rate (with veins of particular minerals added in, so while it is normally very very hard to find diamond for example, you might find a city established on top of a diamond vein where they are very plentiful). 

---

**Other Features**

These are the basics that will help you get started playing Civcraft, but there are also bonus plugins that will help you later in the game.
 
- To create a market for XP trade, there is [**BottleO**](http://i.imgur.com/ldQyZ.jpg) which allows you to put XP in bottles. 
- To create a benefit for cooperating with society, there is a feature called [**FactoryMod**](https://github.com/gmlaxfanatic/FactoryMod/wiki) which allows you to create factories that produce items at less than their normal costs. 
- To monitor your home while you are away, Citadel has a new feature called JukeAlert which acts as a security monitoring system. It is mentioned in [**this post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1edmte/morning_change_log_for_20130515_jukealert_lives/).

However, I think it's going about it all wrong.

The way I see it now, the combination of all the new additions to Civcraft 2.0 make RealisticBiomes entirely unnecessary. Every time you radically alter game mechanics, you must take into account how people will react. People's actions are *generally* pretty predictable.

Really, at this point, all I know is most people I've asked are very against RealisticBiomes. It's hard to really test RealisticBiomes because the information isn't that available, and it's hard to really test the constraints without creative.


**RealisticBiomes combined with other mods will decrease the dependency on food and increase the dependency on beds**

With the advent of turning food into XP, this will incentivize simply starving to death. If food == XP and XP == money, who will eat food? Food shouldn't be scarce because it's a currency, food should be scarce due to other factors (diseased crops, lack of fertilization/hydration), especially not when death has little to no consequence (besides the minor inconvenience).

I don't know about everyone else, but when I'm travelling, I'll probably carry a lot less food, and will instead carry a bed kit with me. Enough food to get where I'm going, an inventory full of whatever I need, and enough materials to make an iron-reinforced double chest and an iron reinforced bed. Sleep in the bed, go about my business, deposit all my belongings in my chest. Starve, rinse, repeat. Cities will have public spaces for you to starve in peace! I've already started work on designing a nice little starvation house in Carson. Point being, people will find ways around poorly-thought out mechanics.

**RealisticBiomes doesn't necessarily force people to work together** 

A world with RealisticBiomes would turn into Farm Simulator 2013. Cities would be empty because making a living in a city wouldn't be as profitable. People live in cities to build houses, and socialize, not to build gigantic farms in 80 different biomes. 

**RealisticBiomes will probably increase lag on the server**

I remember in the early days of the server in my hometown, Jollytown. This was before there was bukkit or spigot, and we had these massive auto-harvest wheat towers. Four of them, in fact. We filled an entire single chest with bread (not wheat) with a single harvest of all four towers. It brought the server to a crawl. For a while, it was funny, that our wheat tower held that much sway over the server tick. 

Point being, passing the server burden from mob grinders to hundreds of individual farms seems like a particularly poor idea. Controlling out of control mob grinders seems a lot easier (Thanks MusterCull) than preventing farming from running amok. The amount of grow cycles will increase exponentially, and there will be thousands of entities floating around during each harvest. Imagine a bunch of people harvesting their farms concurrently? I'm not an expert on server performance, but I'm doubtful that farming is going to take server load in a positive direction from XP grinding (a solution we had largely fixed?).

**RealisticBiomes is just the XP grinding issue dressed up in a new costume**

Going back to the food = money trope, the new way to get rich will be to have an alt AFK farm, and harvest when it's grown. This is *easier* to bot than an XP farm. Creating a bottable XP farm took pretty complex scripts and programs. 'Botting' a farm will require planting, then going AFK and sitting in a minecart track. This will *increase* the amount of AFK botting.

I can already hear the server squealing from here.
 
**RealisticBiomes will punish casual players and serves as a massive buff for griefers/theives**

On the previous iteration of Civcraft, the tech tree allowed everyone to provide for their own basic needs, even with a humble farm. You could be a casual player who logged on primarily to socialize with people (Le timmy &lt;3). With RealisticBiomes the availability of food will move much closer to zero, punishing casual players

If making food scarce wasn't bad enough, protecting your crops will suddenly become impossible. If food = money, farm griefing will become the new method of griefing. There's virtually no defense against this. From what I understand, you can't effectively put farms underground with RealisticBiomes, so there's virtually no defense against farm griefing. Sure you can probably put a glass roof on your farm, but glass isn't a very reinforceable material.     


**Moving forward**

-RealisticBiomes is a fine idea, but I don't think it should completely override vanilla growing mechanics. Maybe we could retain vanilla growing mechanics, but give the respective biomes MULTIPLIERS to base growth mechanics.

-Allow some sort of mechanic to ALLOW growing food in biomes you're not supposed to. Perhaps with some sort of material, or something? I was thinking, maybe if you kept a few farm animals in the vicinity, to 'encourage' growth? Glowstone? Redstone Lamps? Don't know. 

-Other ideas that I'm sure other people have. Let's hear 'em.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_1e1dj8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1e1dj8/on_artificial_difficulty_realisticbiomes/,

_____________________________________

##1. Humble Beginnings
I joined this server some time around November of last year at the behest of some good friends from HCFactions, Legobrah and Bloo_Butterfly. It seemed that their group was trying to take down the ""AnCap Regime"" that had some sort of iron grip on the poor innocent server inhabitants. This is obviously far from the truth, but it was that notion that piqued my interest and brought me here. 

My first day was spent traveling thousands of blocks to reach their base of operations and get settled in. Once there I was geared by Bloo_Butterfly and I spent a fair bit of time decorating the base. When I started venturing outside of the base, it was to place snitches in major locations in the nether. Despite the cries of my compatriots of ""They'll pearl you once they find out you're from HCF!"" I went anyways, figuring that they would do no such thing; I was correct. I remember on one occasion Matticus_Rex came across me in the nether while I was placing a snitch, sparking a dramatic stare-down. Yet I was left undisturbed to carry about my business. 

##2. The Vault

The next few weeks were fairly boring and mostly involved listening to Lego continuously be pearled in outnumbered fights. At this point I had caught word of *something* that TravisSupreme and others were working on, but it was very secretive and only a few people were allowed to know (I not among them). I had even decided to move to Gordge's new city because of the lack of involvement I was allowed. Fast forward to the evening and night of December 20th, 2012 and the following morning of December 21st, 2012. I was in mumble with TravisSupreme, Prerequisite, Russian_Roulette, Yakman and a few other people. It was decided that they would do ""the thing"" (the vault break) tonight, obviously well ahead of schedule and with far less numbers than previously anticipated. I was over ten thousand blocks away from Columbia at the time and had to go to my base to get armor and potions. By the time I got to Columbia, they were about 1-1.5 hours into the project, already digging into the vault's weak point. My time was almost entirely composed of jumping around Columbia on the surface and on occasion chasing off Arkanjil who was in the city. After pulling an all nighter, Gordge arrived at around 10 am EST. Around 11 am EST the first round of bans were issued. This ban was lifted in one hour following an apology from the administration. Travis and prereq were the two that were digging the entire time, however, following the removal of the ban, real life commitments required them to log off, leaving me, the only other person with an efficiency pickaxe, to mine the last piece of DRO (already at decently) and break the final chest. We released *everyone*, indiscriminately. Once I freed the final pearl, I DRO'd the vault in behind me and killed myself. 

##3. The Aftermath

We reveled in our success for a day before we were banned again for the use of xray or an equivalent client mod. Yakman decided it best to come clean and tell the public that he, in fact, used world downloader with the help of TravisSupreme and Richard_T. After another day we were, *yet again*, unbanned following a post by ttk2, laying the fate of the case in the public's hands. The person to take up the case was Pheenixm who posted the original thread that started the case. The case was made for either side, and I still maintain that the use of World downloader was in no way against the rules as they existed at the time. That being said, ttk2 made the decision and issued bans to Ezziot, Yakman1, TravisSupreme, Prerequisite, ApacheBlitz, and rrowland. A decision that showed the ineptitude of the administration's judicial process, demonstrated by the fact the rrowland *was pearled inside the vault we were breaking* and ApacehBlitz didn't even touch the vault. I myself only breaking 1 piece of DRO and a chest, entirely unaware of the use of world downloader. We were banned Christmas Day.

##4. First HCF War

This is the moment that I maintain that the First HCF War began, as a retaliatory strike in response to the unreasonable bannings of our players. A large group of HCF players launched intensive griefing strikes against several cities. Grief that was so bad it led to a change in the griefing mechanics on the server, making cobble mountains impossible. This also marked the beginning of Spurion's reign which entailed hundreds of innocents being pearled for months and placed in both his vault and the world border. 

##5. Ace

I didn't immediately get on Ace613, hoping that the admins would come to their senses. I finally reasoned with myself to do so, saying to myself ""If the ban was just, I would accept it. This is not just."" Keep in mind that I did this without altering my IP, I did not use a VPN or any proxy service, I just simply logged on. My plan on Ace was to play the server as I would have on Ezziot, in a *moderately* peaceful manner. The first thing I did was found a city; Tux Hold. SoggyLettuce and I were the first people to establish Tux Hold, and soon grew it into a fairly nice city (almost entirely by my own hand). During this time I was asked to break into Foofed's vault (if you remember, the released pearls were repearled), this time taking a very direct approach; straight down. I chose to be one of the miners, AFK mining 6-7 layers of DRO, after which the job was turned over to Hamster238 to mine the rest of the way. This time, only people associated with the HCF side were released, the other pearls were transported to either Spurion's, or the world border vault. The world border vault was owned and operated by Atrvmis (?) and Crashete, both players who I knew at the time were Travis and Prerequisite. 

Back in Tux Hold, I was unaware the close proximity of my town with that of Bay City. I realized the closeness of the two when one day the HCF player Unphair was terrorizing the residents of Bay City and I pearled him for it, an act the forever cemented my relationship with Bay City and Ryanamidon in particular. Tux Hold continued to grow alongside Bay City, in fact, it was one of the first residences of NJPalms, at which point he had only owned minecraft for 1 week. 

The beginning of the end of my time on Ace began when I was hunting Mandy, BalkanStove and Co, and I went into the Nine mumble to help them hunt them. I didn't bother not talking, yet there was one person in there who recognized my voice, Whosnick. He said ""Oh, Ezziot. I had a feeling you were still playing, you're Ace?"" To which I didn't respond. It became known that I was Ezziot be a growing number of people, and I was eventually banned along with numerous other alts of banned players. 

I should use this time to mention (though entirely out of order) the fact that during my time on Ace613 and into the time I was unbanned, Positronic spent time in mumble with us. When I say us I mean Prerequisite, TravisSupreme, Richard_T, and myself. He supplied all of the obsidian used to construct the black line and the vault as well as telling us information regarding the whereabouts of BHC/World Police.

##6. Redemption

I messaged Dredd at this point regarding my ban appeal. When asked wether I played on the server since Ezziot was banned I replied in a matter of fact manner, saying I played on Ace613. He replied that I would be unbanned 1 month after he last saw me on Ace613; February 15th. 

I was unbanned on March 16th and quickly rejoined Ryan at Bay City. I got a plot and built a nice house and discussed plans with Ryan for the future. This is around the time that IceeHipHop (Icee being prerequisite) was rampaging around killing all the Plams of the world and causing an all around ruckus across the server. Positronic aided in most of the kills that IceeHipHop made by supplying the coords to their bases, where they were going, where they were going to be. He also told us what they were discussing, their plans, actions of admins in relation to their group. Without the help of Positronic, I don't think IceeHipHop would have been as much of a grievance as he was. I was obviously aware of who Icee was, and I fought along side him.

An anonymous source tipped us off (with proof) that Positronic had also acted against us in the past. It seemed that he belonged to neither side. He supplied information to us as well as to the World Police, a double-agentry that neither side was aware of until recently. We genuinely saw posi as a good friend, and finding out that he betrayed us was honestly one of our worst times on the server.

It was at this point that I turned in IceeHipHop as prerequisite to garner some support with the administration (and avoid a possible ban if Posi revealed what he knew). I suppose I did it ""to save myself"", but I had ulterior motives behind it. 

##7. The Beginning of the End

During the first vault raid I was pearled and placed in Foofed's world border vault. I wanted to pay reparations and told Posi to speak to Foofed about it (before we knew the truth about Posi) and he told me Foofed was going to ask for 8,000d in reparations, a price I believed and rejected. At this point Ryan and I had mined out a vein that was described by JudgeDredd to be the second largest vein ever found on the server. Then we found a vein that was supposedly Eagles' vein. After that, I mined a massive diamond vein with clowny, an action that led to my banning. Needless to say, we had the resources necessary for a monstrous vault that could tower over every other in all of CivCraft. The vault is 46 layers to be precise and took an obscene amount of diamonds to build.

Then came RKWildCard's SECOND vault break. This is when I was questioned by Mr. Dredd. He asked me about Clowny123 and Aveelynn. I knew who both of these players were, yet I lied to Dredd about them. I told him that Clowny was a friend from steam (not a lie), and that he couldn't possibly be a banned player (a lie). Aveelynn was Iceehiphop/prereq, I just said that she was described as a ""cunt"" by tehaleks. 

A couple of days ago I attacked Foofed in Tigerstaden, believing that he was there to attack me (I did strike first). This blew up into a large, pointless fight. I however, have since payed Foofed reparations and have been released from his vault on Ezziot. Honestly, I'm glad I decided to talk to him because he is far more reasonable than I have been led to believe by others. We had a casual, civil conversation and agreed to terms. Foofed released me before I even gave him coords to a drop chest, I could have just run off and not looked back, but I wanted to establish some sort of reconciliation between the two of us. All in all, I gave him 128d, and 1 set of prot 4 for the fight in Tigerstaden.

Now here we are. Today. This afternoon I was banned from CivCraft on all of my accounts for associating with a banned player, travissupreme on his alt Clowny123. Travis is a really good friend, I would never turn him in, and I don't regret ever associating with him. I will forever feel that our ban was unjust and undeserved. This situation could have been handled differently by all sides, yet it wasn't and now here we are. 

_____________________

The HCF War brought out the worst in everyone on this server. Three days ago I realized just how stressed this server made me, it wasn't healthy, I can't take it. I have made some really good friends on this server, Ryanamidon and Tehaleks chief among them, and probably the only two people to be consistently nice to me. The people on this server had already driven Tehaleks off, and I'm left with no will to alt; it's not worth it. The drama was fun for awhile, but now it's *hateful*, I too have given into some of this hate and it isn't healthy. I shouldn't hate people over a video game, but I do. People on both sides are assholes, no one is right in this, it's a farce. It was for the best that I was banned. Perhaps I can return to a regular sleep schedule and a more happy attitude.

I'm sorry to everyone I've lied to. I tried to be nice to most everyone I met, and sometimes it was reciprocated, other times, it was not. Maybe CivCraft will be a better place without me. I don't think much will change without me around, the ignorant will stay ignorant, and the children will remain children. Best of luck. If you have any questions, feel free to ask (that goes for you too, admins).

(see original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/19l46o/mod_proposition_riot_mechanics/))


I have put a version of this up on GitHub if people would be interested in testing it out. The current implemented features are:

* **throwable bricks**, which break windows, and damage mobs and players. Players do not take much damage, but their armor takes a lot of damage.

* **molotov cocktails**, which are repurposed splash mundane potions that create a radius of fire around them, and can be crafted like a normal splash mundane potion.

* **grenades**, which are repurposed fire charges (their fire starting ability has been disabled). By default, when you throw a grenade, it will explode 3 seconds later. This explosion can injure people, but not break stone. This is configurable.


Each of these mechanics can be disabled and enabled independently, and have additional settings that can be tweaked. I will be waiting until the mods update to 1.5 in order to test compatability with the current mods, but I would like to provide the link for people to test out these features on their own (if they are so inclined).

1361391621.0,49,self.Civcraft,18wmo5,Its time for some changes in policy ,55,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18wmo5/its_time_for_some_changes_in_policy/,"Civcraft has so far in its life followed a pretty simple mantra in its administration, and that is to automate as much as possible and have a small administration team handling what could not feasibly be automated. We hoped that this structural idea would help to leave players to solve their own problems and simply provide them a set of clear rules mostly enforced perfectly and non-partisanly by code. Anything that could not be solved with code would be handled with the utmost care and attention of one of a few trusted administrators. 

It has become clear that this was a futile hope, that while it may be possible to automate a lot and expect players to take the initiative on a great deal there comes a point where more effort and structure is required than our current system can provide for. Dredd was the start of a fundamental reorganization on our part that I now wish to carry to its conclusion, but to do that we are going to need your help. 

First and foremost we need to retool our mods with more administrative powers and PEX support. All of our current tools have been designed with the idea of being operated primarily from the terminal, and this limits us extremely in adding new administrators or even just assistants as they both have unlimited power and require significant Linux experience to do anything. By moving more commands in-game with proper permissions support, we can better assign tasks and powers based on trust and ability. 

Once we have the ability to bring people in granularly we are going to need to make use of that. I would like to draft current or former Civcraft programmers, who have always been the unspoken administrators on Civcraft by providing us with tools and assistance, as at *least* administrative candidates as we move to streamline and better structure ourselves. 

The most significant implications of this are as follows, **formal accusation policy is henceforth disbanded** in favor of moving the job of justice to the [Grand Hall Of Justice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18wmqy/the_grand_hall_of_justice_policy_a_threat_and_bans/), a division of administration operated by Chief Judge Dredd and his assistant Judges as he may acquire and assign them. Any and all evidence players may have should be sent to him either through modmail or directly, but otherwise the Judge may take the initiative in investigations.  

On the subject of the condition of the new admins status as players, basic assistants may continue to play, although they will be discouraged from taking too active a role in current events, as it is important that we remain able to obtain input about the game and interact with it ourselves instead of being entirely removed from it, we intended the ivory tower of admin crimes to be figurative, not literal. That being said, clear abuse of administrative knowledge will not be taken lightly and will be grounds for stripping of rank, or if blatant enough, banning from the server. These punishments will be lead by the Grand Hall Of Justice, which will also find under its authority cases against administrators and within the Grand Hall Of Justice there will be no currently active players making final decisions. I feel that by separating players from Justice we can isolate administrative abuse without isolating the whole administration from the playerbase. 

I apologize if the administration has seemed slow or apathetic on the issues at hand. We are all busy with our lives as students as well as the projects coming up for Civcraft, and we hope that by following these changes in policy we can get the help we need to do this job the best it can possibly be done. Please also see the comments for details on what you can help us out with and exactly how in game moderators will function.

Today I've come to inform you about terrible news from Tigerstaden. One user, **pavel_the_hitman**, was caught using illicit hacks after he was pearled. The evidence in questions provides proof that pavel was in fact using a Sprint Hack that coincide with him also using the Nodus Hacked Client. The sprint hack allows pavel's character to send sprinting packets to the server while he was standing still. I am requesting that this user be banned, as any of his alt accounts.


**The Evidence:** 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ7aGqM_uxE

Now, as the narrator of the video stated, lag could not be a factor since he was talking and walking around regularly. You may argue that how would we know to pin-point Nodus directly. Well, the answer lies within pavel himself. After the event occurred, he posted this screenshot: 

http://imgur.com/vRB04iN

If you nodus, the screenshot shows ""[N] Added death waypoint"". That is a feature of Nodus.

**Is Nodus Sprint Hack Illegal?**

In the words of your very own ttk2,

&gt;Since I am not terribly familiar with the exact way that works I will be general, the definition of cheating for this server is doing something that it is totally impossible or statistically impossible for you to do with the normal client, for example some people have a mod that remaps sprint to their shift key instead of the pesky double tap. This is not considered 'cheating' because they are still sending the same sort of data to the server and a player good enough at double taping w could do the same things.

&gt;Nodus Sprint hack, if I remember correctly, sends the running signal at all times, even when not moving, since it is always sending the running signal it violates the rules by sending data the regular client never would as it would never send running while standing still. Furthermore it can be sued to do crits and such more often than otherwise possible.

**tl;dr yes.**

**While innocents you helped pearl are still in vaults, your claims and reformations mean absolutely nothing**

Really, this seems to escape you. You helped put those people in there and until they're out, your words are going to fall on deaf ears and your claims threads are worthless. Paying someone with diamonds, prot sets, or whatever is nothing compared to freedom.

You don't seem to understand the justice and arbitration that was commonplace on this server before you came. Here's a quick rundown:

* you commit a crime

* you're caught and evidence is presented 

* you want to rejoin society on the server

* You have to pay reparations for **all** crimes and must reverse the damage done (IMPORTANT! THIS IS THE PART YOU'RE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH) **edit for people who are really fixated on this, I'm referring to the vaulted innocents, I don't seriously expect them to pay reparations for every little grievance.**

[Recommended listening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbwlGv9SWfY)

*A/N: Forgive the artistic license taken in regards to events. All characters and events in this story–even those based on real people–are entirely fictional. All celebrity players are impersonated.....poorly.*

'Twas a pleasant evening in the fair city of Mt Augusta. Communists frolicked and played in the dying light of the sun, their collective enjoyment regarded enviously by the diamond-hoarding ancaps in their lonely fortresses. Noobs, lulled to the city by tales of limitless riches and and a near-constant supply of drama, labored upon unclaimed corners constructing their very own houses, under the benevolent and merciful gaze of the God and esteemed leader of the global proletariat, Zombie_Lenin.  The ever-watchful town militia guardd the massive vault, keeping those who would disturb this peace in  almost inescapable confinement, and reminding all would-be griefers of the prospect of spending ~~eternity~~ the time it takes for government bureaucracy to process their trial wandering the bleak wasteland of the end with all the other dammed souls. 

Many of the city's more cynical residents had warned in the past that this safety enjoyed by everyone within Mt Augusta's walls rested precariously upon the ability of the world police to catch criminals, something they could not rely on forever and would one day leave the city vulnerable to attack. But they were laughed away and their ideas dismissed by the majority of Augustans. But even these pessimistic players had no idea of what was to come, of the storm that would soon unleash itself upon the city.

Like all great storms the signs of its coming were few and far between. A broken chest here, a backwater village of newfriends burned to the ground there, nothing that would suggest or arise any more suspicion then would normally be granted to petty banditry. 

Then it happened. 

A citizen, murdered  within sight of the city center. News of it spread like wildfire throughout the city's various districts, the truth becoming more distorted with every retelling. 

""Didn't you hear? MrTwiggy killed a noob outside Ataraxia!""

""Someone pearled Foofed outside Aristopolis!""

""I heard from someone who heard from someone that Twiglet raped Tactful in his Prussian sex dungeon!""

Ever the level-headed public servant, Sami_Ghani quickly assessed the situation and the increasing absurdity of the rumors being exchanged from person to person, and recognized that  they were not quelled officially, Augusta could have a full-fledged riot on its hands. With that in mind he began banging together various kitchen utensils in the hope of attracting the attention of the mob, and to his surprise eventually managed to garner the attention of all but a loud-mouthed few. He then coughed, and climbed upon the nether portal to address the rabble.

""Friends, Comrades, Augustans, I bring myself before thee to shed the light of truth upon the various accounts of what happened around half an hour ago, and hopefully reassure the community in the process. A heinous crime has been perpetrated this night, the likes of which have not occurred in Augusta for over a hundred years. Blood was spilt upon Augustan soil. 

""But do not panic dear friends, for you are in no especial danger. The perpetrator has been driven off by our heroic town militia, to cowardly to face the consequences of his crime, and as we speak the denizens of the Batcave rally their best bounty hunter sin order bring this coward to justice. It is with a heavy heart I must ask something of you- remain vigilant, Augustans. Although I can guarantee that no further deaths will occur tonight, we must all do our part to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again. Keep this in mind as you return home, but rest easy with the knowledge that you still reside in the safest and most popular city within civcraft. Thank you for your patience and cooperation on this matter.""

Sighing with relief the mayor turned to Csimplify as the crowd dispersed. Making sure he was not overheard, he gave one simple command. 

""Take me to the body.""

They found Ron_Paul_2012 and several other prominent members of the city government awaiting their arrival, standing feet away from what appeared to be a white body bag. Acknowledging the mayor's presence with a nod, the assembled officials appeared to be staring at the mighty Atraxian wall rather than the dead body. Curious as to what stole their attention from the corpse of a fellow citizen, Sami raised his eyes to a spot halfway up the wall upon which two words were inscribed, painted bold in the blood of the recently deceased. What it entailed struck fear into the hearts of all present.

**NO REPERATIONS**

""You don't think-""

Mr Ghani's inquiry was cut short by thecriminalmind.

""Yes. It was him. MrTwiggy was not acting alone."" Fear was evident in his voice, apprehension hinged upon every syllable.

Suddenly a rumbling was heard emerging from the other side of the city, just outside the walls. It was getting louder by the second and soon the earth began to shake violently with every stomp. Csimplify hit the floor, eyes widened in sheer terror.

""Earthquake?!""

Ron Paul shook his head and laughed bitterly.

""Fool! Was it not prophesied that this day would come? You only had to listen. You could have stopped this!""

As if shaken from a trance by Ron's harsh words, Sami turned to the elderly Congressman. 

""Huh? what's happening?""

[""It's happening.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYD46Q0a3Qo)

A window smashed. A woman screamed. But one sound stood out above all. A guttural war cry, long regarded as the herald of the end times.

**""GORDGE SMASH!""**

*A/N: Congrats on making it this far. I apologize to anyone even vaguely offended by their depiction in this tale, but you're the only major Augustan players I could think of off hand. Pre-reading? Aintnobodygottimefordat.*

* First things first, we have our new map generation settings and a new **testing** map to go with them. This should officially mark the movement of our map generation scheme from alpha to beta as most of the changes from here on in need to be tweaks and bugfixing. Please bear with me, everyone coming online and exploring the new map is going to cause some issues with lag, I will try to fill the map when possible but there is a reason why I insist production maps be pre generated. 
&gt; * Added veins of varying sizes and densities. Small ones are more frequent, large ones are rarer.
&gt;* Veins of Diamonds, Iron, Coal, and Quartz exist throughout the entire world.
&gt;* Fixed random issues brought up over the last week or so with biome tags and what not.
&gt;* Biomes are MUCH larger
&gt;* Added lots of rivers
&gt;* Nether biomes are now smaller islands scattered through the ocean instead of on the main continents
&gt;* Added Quartz ore to the entire map

* We have a build of RealisitcBimoes that provides for persistent crop growth, unfortunately its DB seek times, while pretty good, will not work out very well in a production environment. With this in mind we are trying to move it over to async queries like JukeAlert, but it seems database optimization is the current primary bottleneck of the development team, we need an example implementation of optimized table setups and async query systems. 

* RiotCraft is now online, with the armor damage for bricks set a little lower than normal. I don't know where a good guide to this plugin is, so if someone could direct me that would be excellent. 

* MineLibrary, essentially a chest system for bookshelves this mod allows books to be stored in bookshelves, I would also like to move the book duplication code from morecraftableblocks to this mod if we decide to use it, I am currently unopposed and waiting on a .jar.

* On the subject of alts, currently the alts list system is not feasible to delegate at all, primarily because it requires ssh to modify various text files, those whom I trust enough to give SSH rarely know how to use it, those who know SSH are delegated to programming most of the time anyways to make best use of human resources. For it to be feasible to delegate the alts list system would need to be merged into prisonpearl (no external script) and then have in game commands to handle exclusions and figuring out who is associated with who so that anyone who can log into Minecraft and be given the right permissions can help out in those situations. Further action on alts can not even be considered until this is done. 


* If you wish to help out Civcraft we are always looking for developers and testers, please talk to me about getting added to the development google group if you have an interest and some experience in programming.

* Cliff seems to have worked out how to generate veins of almost any type into the map with world painter, NetherBiomes are now isolated from the land on islands like Mushroom biomes as well, more rivers and other small tweaks have also been made. This config is not yet on Civtest, but once we get this up and tweak it a bit I think it will mark the transition of the map generation out of Alpha into Beta, meaning its ready for its first false start test. 

* JukeAlert is the only launch essential I item that I do not have any sort of build for, alpha, beta, or otherwise. Since its very much important to get it tested I would like to have one as soon as possible. At the same time I understand significant development work is going into Citadel as well to prepare the system to run on the same group system. 

* Updated Humbug, it now disables water in the nether biomes as well as the dyeing of sheep. Finally it adds a slowness affect to bows when hit. Questions comments and concerns are welcome. 

* FactoryMod has been updated with some improvements to xp bottling from crops as well as other minor changes.

* We are still in need of a stripped down build of Bottle0 I think there is a project bottle0 lite that fits out needs but until I get a .jar I am left somewhat hanging. 

* there is already a bukkit 1.5.2 recommended build out and other than the usual dozen or so dupe bugs at this stage it seems to be working pretty well. It may be worth it to go ahead and move on up to 1.5.2 as they will be on a recommended build pretty quickly. Can anyone comment on what plugins would need to be recompiled and such? 


* In a somewhat embarrassing mistake I forgot that I needed to restart Civtest once per day to get pearl feeding working properly, so I am now doing this and you should be able to tell if your pearl was given a cost or not after a day or two of this. Sorry for the mistake. 

* Riotmod: It seems the general sentiment is that its good but brick damage needs to be nerfed, I would like a .jar with the brick damage halved and then we can start playing around with it in testing. 

* MineLibrary, essentially a chest system for bookshelves this mod allows books to be stored in bookshelves, I would also like to move the book duplication code from morecraftableblocks to this mod if we decide to use it, I am currently unopposed and waiting on a .jar.

* Hatred of any individual will get you nowhere, whats done is done, there is nothing left to do but move on and hold your head up high. Or maybe sue. 

* It seems that this ore distribution plus a lot of smaller veins plus factory mod to counter scarcity should serve us well. I am still waiting on the next map config with the changes I outlined in yesterdays change log. There is some talk about how to setup a 1:8 nether with fixed portals, if someone could outline the mods and setup for that so that I can make an informed decision that would be great. Also if we are to consider it some discussion over the concept of fixed portals is needed.  

* Good news everyone, there seems to be a lot of activity going on in the JukeAlert github now and significant progress being made, its my hope to have a alpha or beta build soon but we will see how things progress from here on in. Regardless I would consider us moving at a good pace to getting what we need to get done.

* As I explained yesterday (and people seem to keep not reading) I very much like Factorymod, but disabling crafting recepies server side is very much a hacky and glitchy process that can and will be abused if we try it. Furthermore players are unnecessarily alienated by *forcing* them to go through factory mod. I am not giving up on it so much as making a compromise that I think will work better, by reducing the ore distribution to 1/4th (I have requested 1/6th for the next test map) natural levels in addition to limited spawners producing various goods through vanilla mining and crafting will be difficult if at all feasible. Factorymod will be the most cost effective option by far and this lets us have the mod, makes people use it, but does not have hacky recepie disabling or force people away from what they are familiar with (even though it does make vanilla crafting a bad idea). 

  
* There are noted existing bugs with CombatTag now, if someone could document them in detail and put them on Erocs combat tag github it would be greatly appreciated. I have also heard strange things about PrisonPearl messing up in some cases and Citadel glitches with hoppers, all of these need to be worked on whenever someone gets a chance.

Many nether portals are locked (meaning you can't get out of the portal, or open your inventory, or even chat while you're in it), and the latest update to Humbug disables enderpearl glitches. Your go-to weapon should instead be a lava bucket in your hotbar. Just double right-click with it fast and you will disable the portal and clean up the lava before it can spread. You can then use your flint and steel (which doesn't have to be in the hotbar) to relight the portal, which will instantly transport you to the other dimension. A water bucket works too, but only if you're stuck in the overworld.

I was an aspiring merchant and entirely neutral in the HCF / Civcraft affair. I remember being interrogated by a few of the AnCaps as I passed through Columbia soon after the first HCF attempt on Foofed's vault - they demanded to know what side I was on. I answered that I was neutral, and that I would remain neutral until something forced me to choose a side.

[Spurion, Bloo_Butterfly, Richard_T, Y_ankees, Gordge, Captin_milky, thuggernaut, IMNOTSAM1997, dilate04, hamster238, and others forced me to choose a side when they pearled me and broke into my shop](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/15qgja/bounties_galore/). I had logged into my shop at 0,0 in the Nether on Christmas day to find about fifteen players breaking my chests. Thankfully, by some stroke of luck, the player holding the pearls of me and about 15 other players seemed to log out / time out and we were released in Mt. Augusta. I immediately killed myself in the lava that had been placed everywhere by these players in an attempt to turn Mt. Augusta into a large cobble monument to 'teh lulz.' 

So, I chose to resist the invading griefers from HCF, HCSMP, and other servers. I felt that it was in my best interest as a consistent player of Civcraft and a merchant on the server to ensure that I would not be attacked again. I began working with members of the ""world police"" to pearl the players that had stolen from and killed me. 

While I was lucky enough to be unpearled the same day, quite a few of my friends were not. Most of them remained pearled in various vaults and, [although Mcfluffykins recently released a few of my friends](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17jydr/for_all_you_nonbeliebers/), none of them them have returned to the server. **Several of the friends I made on Civcraft since joining in August 2012 have been driven away from this server**. 

It has now been over a month since these initial raids and many of my friends remain pearled. I cannot travel the nether or open my shop for fear of the invading players and their new allies attacking me (despite some of them claiming to be neutral in this affair) and imprisoning me forever. Several of my friends are wanted for defending themselves in the same way that I have. [I lost about 100d in material and time - an amount that pales in comparison to what the server as a whole has lost](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/15ooih/post_what_the_hcf_stole_from_you/). 

I began to resist because my rights were violated, my property was stolen, and my friends were driven away from this server. I continue to resist because several of my friends remain pearled and because the people who caused me harm are still free to do the same to others. While I would be happy to forgive and forget (even omitting reparations) with the invading players from HCF / HCSMP / anywhere else who would like to play this server legitimately, I will not stop resisting until players such as Y_ankees, Richard_T, and all of their alts are gone from this server and my friends are freed from their obsidian prisons.

If you think you'd like to play or something, just comment in so I can get a good idea of what to expect turnout to be.

I have now added a system that makes it so you can obtain glorious bragging rights on top of blood money. Remember, when you have someone's pearl, just:

* Check for their name on [CivBounty](http://www.civbounty.com) with the new search feature. (Their name will autocomplete if they have active reports).
* On their reports page, Click 'I have the pearl' (while logged in) and create a claim on it.  
* Click 'post claims thread' to create a thread on Reddit / Even PM Author's of reports by clicking on their name.
* When people close their reports they will be asked to reward you with points
* ?????
* Profit

*But DecoyDrone ?! The person I just caught wasn't on CivBounty. What do I do?*

Tell people to use CivBounty of course! Help me spread the word. Let them know that they can put that wall of text on CivBounty and post to Reddit with just a few more clicks.

**Bounty Hunter Features**

So right now this is the bare minimum sketch of what I have planned. In the future the leader board will have different factors weighting in other than just rewarded points. For instance, reports will soon have crime categories and a Hunter will receive more points for closing murder reports vs. theft.

**Other planned features** (please add on to these in comments below!):

* Minecraft user names / mugshots like perps on front page list
* Hunter stat pages 
* Public access to where rewards came from (since this reward system is a little based on honor, it will soon be public knowledge as to who rewarded the Hunter points. In cases of foul play during Beta I will just reset their points)
* Email alerts?
* More automation around announcing captures, including auto Reddit PM's to all report authors

##All users of CivBounty##

**Spread the word**

With the new search function you can very easily do a background check on someone you don't know. If they have active records against them, the name will autofill.  

The search is only as useful as the quality/quantity of reports in the database. So please make sure everyone knows they can use CivBounty. It is very easy to post a report to Reddit once it is created (might make this a one click thing if people want it). And even if you don't have diamonds to pay a bounty hunter you can now reward them with leader board points.

I have been suggesting people post to CivBounty when I see a crime report thread. If you see one that I miss, please gently bludgeon them into using it so that everyone can benefit from their report.

**Thanks**
Everyone who has been helping me out with feedback / using the app is awesome. Thank you

**TL;DR** CivBounty has internet points and search now, spread the word so it is dirt simple to keep track of crime on Civcraft

1357843030.0,48,self.Civcraft,16bs3v,OreGin Guide - The Automated Mining Machines,67,19,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16bs3v/oregin_guide_the_automated_mining_machines/,"**OreGin Guide - The Automated Mining Machines**

Hey everyone. At the moment, there are plans to add my plugin OreGin to the next round of CivTest for public testing, for the potentiallity of eventually moving it onto CivCraft. I figured I should create a short guide/tutorial on what Ore Gins are, how they work, and their purpose/benefits.

Here is a short video demonstrating some of the plugin features:

[Demo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNX-ZEiCleM)

**Yellow Flower:** The yellow flower is used as an 'upgrade tool'. With it, you can create new Ore Gins or upgrade existing ones by left clicking on them. In order to create/upgrade an Ore Gin, it needs to have the appropriate upgrade costs (Example: 5 Iron Blocks) in it's inventory, and when you left click on it with the yellow flower, it will upgrade/create.

**Red Rose:** The red rose is used as an 'activation tool'. By left clicking on an Ore Gin, it will activate it and it will begin mining. This can also be done using redstone signals. However, in order for the Ore Gin to be activated, it must have enough fuel for one 'mining operation'. One mining operation is essentially mining the dimensions of the Ore Gin 1 block forward, whether it be a 1x1 tunnel, or an 11x11 tunnel. If an Ore Gin runs out of fuel while mining, it will automatically power off.

**Iron Shovel / The Wrench:** The iron shovel is used as a 'repair tool'. By left clicking on a broken Ore Gin, it will repair it if the appropriate repair costs are in the dispenser. You can tell an Ore Gin is broken by the distinctive flashing light and broken sound. Every time an Ore Gin breaks a block, it will increase it's respective 'block breaks'. Once the block breaks exceed the maximum block breaks for that tier, it will break down and won't be usable until it is repaired.

**Placing/Destroying An Ore Gin:** In order to destroy an Ore Gin, you can simply break the Dispenser or Redstone Lamp block associated with the Ore Gin and it will break. If an Ore Gin is destroyed, it will disappear and the Ore Gin item will be dropped. The Ore Gin items are distinctive through their names and lores. The following format is used for those:

Name: T(L) OreGin

Lore: Status: (STATUS) ( (BLOCK BREAKS) )

Where (L) is the tier level of the Ore Gin, the (STATUS) is the current status of the Ore Gin (broken/working), and the (BLOCK BREAKS) is the number of blocks this particular Ore Gin has broken since it's last repair/upgrade.

**Retrieving Valuables:** Certain tiers of Ore Gins have special features that make it more beneficial to the owner. One example of this is the 'Retrieve Valuables' feature that certain higher level Ore Gins possess. If the Ore Gin has this, whenever it mines a valuable block, it will attempt to transport the drops from that block into the Ore Gin's inventory. If the inventory is full, it will drop the blocks beside the Ore Gin. (Note: I've toyed with the possibility of allowing players to place chests beside the Ore Gin, in which items will automatically be placed if the OreGin inventory is full.)

**Citadel:** If an Ore Gin comes across a reinforced block, it will simply skip that block and not damage it. This is to prevent potential abuse in assaulting vaults and inaccessible areas with Ore Gins.

**Tier Properties:** Every tier of Ore Gin has it's own respective mining properties. This includes such things as the mining time (how many ticks between each mining operation), the fuel cost, the upgrade cost, the repair cost, the mining distance (how far the Ore Gin will reach before it shuts off), whether it will 'retrieve valuables', the dimensions of it's mining operations, and a few more. At the moment, all of these are very rough estimations of what might be balanced. All balance testing/thoughts are very much appreciated. The current tier properties can be found here:

https://github.com/MrTwiggy/OreGin/blob/master/config.yml

If you agree/disagree with any of the properties, and think certain changes might increase balance, I am open to any and all suggestions. The current settings were very rough and haven't been tested at all for balancing purposes.

Finally, I think that's all. If anyone has any questions/inquries/concerns, feel free to post and I'll respond.

I'd like to take a moment of your time to talk about my new friends; Supposed, and some of the other HCF members.

You see, my younger sister, EleventhPoohBear, was pearled by someone (for no apparent reason) whilst in the Wutang camp. She told me about it, and, being a good brother, I said ""Sure, I'll risk my stuff by going to 0,0 (her pearl was held in a chest at about x: -39, z 64) to meet with the HCF and negotiate your freedom.""

I was 500 blocks away, and decided to make contact with them. Supposed was the first to answer, and we talked about it, with others joining in to say that they didn't know who pearled my sister, and also they dont think that her pearl is in their vaults. Eventually, we settled a deal. He wanted to see both me and EleventhPoohBear in front of him, at the same time. I met him at exactly 0,0 and was surprised. He didn't try to kill me, but instead he said, ""Here is your sister, now please spread the word that a lot of us aren't scumbags.""

So I obliged happily, after setting my sister up in a house near by my own. Now here I am, hoping you guys and girls join me in saying that I think the HCF aren't all some of us make them out to be.

1356182346.0,42,self.Civcraft,15a20y,Ok lets get this ball rolling. ,60,18,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/15a20y/ok_lets_get_this_ball_rolling/,"I am back, much better rested than usual and ready to get started on bringing this whole thing to a final conclusion. Yes, started, my goals this morning are to propose a set of new policy, talk it over for a while, and then finalize it and place it on the sidebar by this afternoon, the issue of vault breaking will not be decided today, or tomorrow because half of these changes and policies can be described as 'slow down'. 

But first things first, the following individuals have been pardoned 

**list removed due to privacy issues, contact modmail if need be. All HCF players involved with the vault crack have been pardoned**

----

As for their now famously controversial actions they remain as they stand until the new policies I am about to outline are used to resolve the issue. 

First comes an administration prime directive of sorts, Civcraft admins exist to create, maintain, and expand game mechanics that allow the creation of player societies in Minecraft. For example when a player is being pearled the game mechanic is in place, and operating correctly, there are no grounds for admin intervention unless it can be shown that the mechanic is not working correctly. 

With that in mind I would like to expand the adversarial system we have previously used in cheating accusations against players into administrative issues of the manner presented to us now. The idea and method is relativity simple those proposing admin action must present their arguments that the situation violates the prime directive and should be corrected. For example ""Foofed could not have reasonably predicted the flaw in his vault and how it would be exploited without using x-ray and being more familiar than is reasonable with constantly changing minecraft player physics, thus he could not have built a secure vault, and its cracking represents a flaw in the Citadel game mechanic"" and send a message to modmail notifying us of its creation so that the other side may respond like this ""Foofed could have reasonably known about and corrected for the flaw thus the vault being cracked is representative of his mistake and not a flaw in the Citadel game mechanic and there are no grounds for admin intervention."" 

Those are of course only examples and far from the only arguments that can be made, only arguments within that thread and not make towards the presiding admin will then be used to reach a conclusion probably quite some time after the thread is created. This has the advantages of keeping the subreddit much neater by containing the drama and allowing the admins to not participate in it except in the capacity they must to reach and act upon a conclusion at which point such a conclusion is acted on retroactively. 

In situations where changes are too rapid or to great to be reversed once a decision is reached a party must file for an injunction with a post to the subreddit showing reasonable cause for the admin prime directive being violated. If there exists cause admins wait a reasonable amount of time for a situation to reach a stable point where outcomes are relatively clear and stop the situation from moving forward until a conclusion had been reached.

For example if an injunction where filed in the situation at hand we would have waited til the vault was fully cracked, the plearls freed, and the players through the portal before reversing anything. This way we have a clear state to return everything to if the injunction is found unwarranted. Simply re-free the prisoners and the situation is as close to where it was as we can get it. 


Its the concept of injunctions that demonstrate the trade offs in this system, first its going to take a lot longer, second there are no secret mechanics as that is the price you pay for public court and admin transparency, third there will be many small things that retroactive action does not cover nearly so well. But the ability to solve problems over time in an organized, public, and conclusive manner. 


-----

Two more points I could not seem to fit in there 

* arguments in public court are accepted as truth in good faith, if an individual is proved to be lying they lost that good faith and have their arguments ignored. In all but the most obvious cases this would end with a de facto loss. 

* Admins reach a conclusion based on the arguments presented, to challenge the conclusion do not start an argument with the admin, note that you are challenging the conclusion to them and challenge the argument where it was presented in thread.

Edit: This is now added in short form under ""Administration policy"" in the cheating policy post on the sidebar.

Suddenly, a guy sits next to him; white, regular height, straight brown hair. Nothing out of the ordinary, except on his lap... the guy has two laptops. 

The player is confused, but imagines there's some sort of reason. Feeling a little ill, he turns over and falls asleep. An hour later, he wakes up mid-flight. He turns over to order a glass of water to settle his stomach, and finds the passenger seated next to him hunched over intensely, both laptops booted up... one running Minecraft, the other a Mumble/subreddit combo.

""Woah,"" says the player, stomach groaning. ""You play Civcraft?""

The passenger turns, a sleight look of confusion on his face.  
""Yeah,"" he replies casually.

""Hey me too!"" exclaims the player, ""What's your username?""

The passenger smiles. ""TTK2"", he proclaims.

The player almost jumps up in shock. ""No way! That's crazy! You're really TTK?""

""Yup,"" he replies.

""Woah,"" says the player, ""That's insane. What are the chances? So you're heading out to New York?""

""Yeah,"" he replies, ""I've been preparing for the trip for about a year now.""

The player seems curious. ""What do you mean?""

""Well,"" TTK begins, ""It's actually the reason I started Civcraft in the first place. I knew this trip was coming up, and wanted to be prepared.""

The player processes this for a few seconds, before asking a follow-up: ""I still don't understand, you invented Civcraft specifically for this trip?""

""Yup,"" TTK responds, as he turns back to review a few new comments.

The player still doesn't quite understand, but he decides to give the Admin the benefit of the doubt. ""So why do you have two laptops on you?""

TTK looked up. ""Oh, same reason. It's all part of my preparation for this journey.""

By now the player was extremely confused. ""Okay, I'm sorry, but... I really don't understand. You invented Civcraft, then brought two laptops running versions of the Mumble and Subreddit, specifically in preparation for this flight?""

/r/TheMetropolis

For those of you who do not not know about about Metropolis, it is a collection of like minded sovereign nations located near each other in deep minus minus on world border.

Note: 

Current Layout: http://imgur.com/Lliz3ad

Keep in mind it is subject to change. The only entry requirement is agreeing to the Contract of Neighborly Understanding below.

Principles of Metropolis:

**Understanding:**

The Metropolis is managed, not by a government, but by a contract of understanding between the cities and Gondolin. It is as follows:

Contract of Neighborly Understanding

- Do not expand past your predefined borders into other parts of The Metropolis
- Problems with other cities of Metropolis should be handled first internally (with other Metropolis members), and elevated externally once that fails.
- Do not harbor griefers
- Respect the other citizens of Metropolis
- Conflicts with citizens are to be handled without violence if at all possible. Violence and detainment is to be reserved for when there is an immediate threat to people or property
- Do not recruit from another city in Metropolis without permission from the affected cities government/leader. 
- Land between cities are mutually owned by everyone. They can be used for herds, non-invasive farms, roads, and small outposts. Do not exert sovereignty over these lands. It is encouraged to work with your neighbor on use of lands between you and them.

**Mutual Defense**

Although all cities are allowed to have their own Armies and ways of going about defence, they are welcome to join in Voluntary Mutual Defence corporations.

One such example will be Exercitus. It was established by lem0nland91111 and will accept members from any of the cities of The Metropolis, and provide Defense services for free to any that need it. Its purpose will be primarily internal matters. Keep in mind it in no way interferes with any participating nation’s sovereignty. It is merely to make a united organized efficient defence system. More details on this are currently classified, but, if you are are interested in helping me with Exercitus, Lemonland91111 can send you the outline. The outline lays out ranks along with the powers and privileges granted depending on participant's ranks.

**Creative Expression**

The entire reason The Metropolis is not a single monolithic city under a government, is to encourage creativity both at the block level, but also on a political level. By encouraging cities to build just outside of chat range of each other, we maximize mutual defense and trade while also maximizing freedom to build civilizations.

**Respect**

“Have fun, but never at the expense of others”. This is one of the most important aspects to support a diverse population, and mitigate conflict.

**Current Members:**

- Minas Minas - Capital of Gondolin
- New Augusta - Constitutional Monarchy, led by GTAIVisbest
- The Settlement - A production centric City with a TBD'd government structure.
- Freedom - City run in anarcho-capitalist style. No government.
- New Covenant - Wildweazel’s Christian Anarchy city
- Solis - A Roman Republic Government, With Roman themes.
- Garrak - A Nomadic closed community
- Aeden - A city created by codedrew2
- Valcar - A city created by alphadog

For further questions... please ask:

- berge403 (King of Gondolin)
- masterful921 (Hand of the King of Gondolin)
- nimajneb3 (Steward of New Avalon)
- lemonland91111 (previous leader of Arx Republicas)
- Wildweazel (leader of New Covenant)
- GTAIVisbest (leader of New Augusta)
- Mark_Antony (a Censor of Solis)

This problem as if it was not already bad enough is amplified by Civcraft’s tendency to keep one continuous world for so long, where the effects of cheats not caught long ago can echo on into the future. 

It is harsh trying to strike a balance between fairness and effectiveness, I try to run Civcraft on a budget of shoe strings and hope and this is true even in administration. When things started I did everything myself, I was judge jury and executioner and I will admit I made lots of mistakes, to be frank at the start there I knew way too little to hold the job and I ended up making some decisions which I do regret and have since taken steps to correct. By the end there I lived in fear of someone cheating in any way big enough for me to have to deal with it, I would ignore things more often than I would take action simply because it had long ago become too much for me to handle on my own. 

People are passionate about this game, I can’t really complain about that it is exactly what this game is trying to inspire, but it places a massive burden on whatever systems may exist to be perfect because people are wont to attack it in any way they can when they see a way to gain advantage. This sort of prolonged and debilitating flame war has become characteristic of Civcraft, as if trying to deal with Minecraft and whatever scraps of evidence it can provide is not bad enough the hard battle has to be fought uphill against well meaning but often uninformed or sometimes malicious community opinion. The only sorts of systems that can survive not being manipulated by the community are exactly the types that the community will least accept. 

This leaves us at a wonderful catch 22 the more checks and balances a system has the less effective it becomes, where the task is already an important and daunting one there is little room for being ineffective and slow to top it all off. 

I get the wonderful burden of striking the balance between that we can hopefully all live with. 

The proposed system is as follows, Cheating investigation and action falls under the authority of a team. At least any given three members of the team required for action, one to initiate, one to second, and a third to review the action at a later date. By virtue of being a moderately sized team the need for a second on the action should serve as a check without making it impossible to act quickly in some situations. The need for a third gives a dedicated period to review of past actions in retrospect and a chance for a final check. 

The initial proposed members of this team are Hpoom, bobpndrgn, ChiefJusticeDredd, and if he cares to join us samighandi 

Obviously once on this team the people in question can not play at the very least until the next map reset if they are to ever be allowed to play again. I would hope to continue to expand this team with more varied and respected members from the community as they volunteer or are asked to join. 

---------

Finally I need to address some concerns about the Chief Justice, he has worked hard and frankly he has been far more effective than I could have ever hoped to have been in his place. I will not say that his actions are perfect or without flaw, everyone makes mistakes, but I do stand by him as a genuinely good person and administrator that cares about this server and the people on it. After all if I only stood by those who were flawless I would quickly find myself standing alone. 

If he is to blame for TeaJizzle’s abuse then I am just as much to blame for not keeping careful tabs on his actions myself. But as I have said before we have not allowed ourselves the luxury of enough personnel to review each other before. But I feel that now is the time to start with the system outlined above. I hope we can all have the maturity to understand that Dredd revealing relevant information to an ongoing investigation in confidence with an assistant does not make him responsible when and if that assistant is to betray his confidence as an assistant administrator. Dredd has been for the last few months been working every bit as hard as I have been and has been nothing but as honest as possible, when the cheaters moved into the metagame he followed them and that is where much of the evidence for his recent bans is sourced from. If you truly have no greater attack on him than that he tried to do his job and did it well I find it commendable. 

But this is ultimately a post about a system, not a person, please see an incoming post from Dredd before you try to make this about him. ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_1d8afs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1d8afs/justice_20/,moderator

This is a perfect example of the problem the roads now face. People are moving, changing, destroying, defacing, and walling off roads for personal gain. If you want to change a road, or move it talk to the road crew, get out advice. This is why 0,0 (not the only offender I assure you)is such a clusterfuck. People building things for there own (or their cities) advancement. 

Ideally the roads all need to be the same hight, and straight. No random turns no stairs to go over an obstacle you are to lazy to move, no shops sitting in the middle of the road, and no diamond reinforced signs replacing important directions!

I, with the help of a select few seized this stolen property and will be returning it to the true owners of these items in Aristopolis.
_____________________________________

A Gimmick Brigade DRO vault was located at -455 3781. The items were seized and documented accordingly.

[Album of layout](http://i.imgur.com/fPtsQG4.png)

The place was in good shape and accessed by a nether portal about 250m away from the entrance.

**The items recovered include:**

Various Enchanted Swords

Stack of Iron Blocks

~5 Stacks of Obsidian

Several stacks of logs

10 stacks of Leather

80 diamonds from the dismantling of the vault

3-4 Stacks of Gunpowder

4 Stacks of Slimeballs

4 Stacks of Powered Rails

1 Stack of Pistons

_______________________________
The second and third locations were outside of Aristopolis, placed in un-protected chests hidden under dirt. 

[Album of locations](http://imgur.com/a/AssQ7)

**Items recovered include:**

Many enchanted swords

Enchanted picks

Glowstone Blocks

10 Stacks of Leather



I was told by Arkanjil that there are anywhere from 10-20 more chests scattered in the near area with equivalent, stolen gear.
________________
Despite the intiative of some Gimmick Brigade members to contact those with claims against them, others remain silent, refusing to pay reparations. While this seizure represents only a small portion of the actual toll the Gimmick Brigade exacted on Aristopolis, I would like to return all of it to the rightful owners.

[Total Seized](http://imgur.com/a/3osMc)

To the Gimmick Brigade: Repay your victims and surrender yourselves to be pearled. It will not be permanent, I am not like you, I will not let that happen. Your victims and the people of CivCraft will decide your fate.

EDIT: I have changed the parts where I refer to the offenders as BHC/Gimmick Brigade to just Gimmick Brigade. I'm sorry, I realize you come from different groups and it isn't fair in lump the offenders with innocents.

**Defendants:**

- TurboCactus (008Shock)
- Disciplined_ (Bleeding_Madras)
- MadeonFinale (eaglesrock57)
- InspectorBellend (Teajizzle)

**Unknown defendants:**

- ~~Space_code~~
- ~~Duplicitas~~
- ~~lifetime0ferr404~~
- Hi_immelol
- Bleedingsnewalt

This will be a one time case against the 4 known individuals. with the reparations split evenly between the 4. Upon resolution of this case, I will not pursue further damages against the 5 unknown, but leave it to the 4 defendants to reclaim their fair portion of damages through their own legal proceedings.

**Damages done:**

The players broke into 2 different vault locations multiple times over 3-4 days. An iro vault near ground level, and a multiple layer DRO vault at bedrock. The DRO vault had EVERY chest broken (6 double chests full), and all valuables removed. I cannot remember everything in the vault, but I know it included:

- 6 stacks of iron blocks
- untold amounts of tnt (10-20 stacks)
- miscellaneous diamond armor
- gold blocks
- lapis blocks
- somewhere between 27-54 stacks of pearls
- MANY stacks of potion materials

Aristopolis treasury losses:
- 3 stacks of iron blocks
- 40d

My best guess is that there was at least ~~350d~~ 450d worth of damages between the 2 vaults.

**evidence**

IRO Vault snitch: http://imgur.com/a/TIdw7

DRO Vault snitch: http://imgur.com/a/Pxsv6

Pictures of breakin locations: http://imgur.com/a/2s8IH

**Reparations**

I am looking for ~~500d~~ 600d worth of reparations. This is only a 33% markup from market value of the remembered items lost. This split between the 4 known defendants would be ~~125d~~ 150d each.

This is less than the value of the gear that each of them equipped their alt with, and in my opinion is a very reasonable amount of reparations for completely emptying my vault.

I look forward to the resolution of this.

**Payment Status:**

- TurboCactus (008Shock) - **PAID**
- Disciplined_ (Bleeding_Madras) - **PAID**
- MadeonFinale (eaglesrock57) - **PAID**
- InspectorBellend (Teajizzle) - **PAID**
- NJPalms (Space_Code) - **PAID**
- Duplicitas (ShadedJon) - **intent to pay**
- Blitzkrieg_ (Arkanjil) - **No Communication**
- lifetime0ferr404 (Cliffnerd5) - **Only involved in IRO vault raid**
- Hi_Immelol (?) - **PAID**

Edit:

Wildweazel has requested me to add the things the Aristopolis city treasury lost in the vault break (was stored in my personal vault), which was a few stacks of iron blocks and 40d (about 100d in total). This brings the total damage to 600d, or 150d each.

This next Civtest is going to be quite large and cumulative, what I mean by that is we are going to be including what we have learned and tried for quite a few versions back as well as community suggestions. 

First and foremost the Nether will be disabled and it looks like its resources are going to be replaced by Nether chunks in the overworld in Orthzars next map, which by the way will also include ore veins, topographical source data, as well as the bedrock height manipulation generation changes suggested previously if they can be made to work. 

In addition to the map updates and changes we noticed this last round that we had multiple mods like XP Pylons and MachineFactory that where really trying to do the same thing. They where attempting to, each in their own way, affect production. It is with that in mind that we are throwing our weight behind [FactoryMod](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/189zui/call_for_programmers_new_mod_factorymod_to/) which now has its inital commit up [here](https://github.com/Manintime/FactoryMod).

The goal of FactoryMod is to add capital expenses beyond simply input materials to production. Read the original post linked for the most detailed explanation, but for the time being what I would like to see implemented first would be the need for factories and batch production for more advanced weapons and armor and maybe even enchanting. Also when it comes to XP it may be appropriate to simply replicate XPPylons inside of Facotrymod or make another form of XP factory that better keeps with the theme of the other factories, that is up to Manintime. 

Regardless my immediate goals here are to hopefully have a map and the very first builds of FactoryMod ready by this Saturday if at all possible. The map has been in the works for a while and the Factorymod code need not be more than disabling crafting of high tier items outside of batches (the factories can be improved through the round, but the initial disabling must be in place). 

With these changes in the works we are approaching the point where I would consider the new features ready to be put into real production use, note that this is not a map reset. Instead it will be something even better.

1361161279.0,42,self.Civcraft,18qd5v,A full account from Gondolin of the battle in Aristopolis,52,10,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18qd5v/a_full_account_from_gondolin_of_the_battle_in/,"A full account of the recent battle dubbed the ""Valentine Massacre"" between Gondolin and Zombie Lenin's posse (for lack of a better term) has not yet been presented to the public. I would like to tell that story, as much as we are aware and as unbiased as I can be given the nature of the situation, so that you can all have an informed opinion of those involved. If I seem to go into unnecessary detail, it's because I'm addressing an argument that has been made against us. This is coming later than I had planned, in part because the fortuitous resolution made it less urgent. I've probably forgotten or muddled a few details, but at the same time more information that I had missed has come forward. And so, my full report:

If you're reading these sorts of threads, you're probably already aware of the tension between Yugoslavia and SPQR, and by extension Buenos Aires and Gondolin. Since we publicly backed SPQR as a territory and involved ourselves in the ceasefire talks the Twin Cities have bonded together in peace, much to the chagrin of Leningrad's hegemony. As soon as this situation settled down, we started hearing reports from Zombie Lenin of an Aristopolitan griefing Buenos Aires. The account in question has never been affiliated with us and we have no idea who it is. Again, hostilities were avoided.

**tl;dr check-in: Prior but unrelated tensions between Leningrad and Gondolin.**

Meanwhile, a few days ago, immelol4, babycham, and dethfly9 arrived in Aristopolis and requested residence in the city. A citizen, having been given permission from city leaders to do so, offered them a free plot of land, according to the council policy for new residents. The plot was an improved area in a neighborhood on the north side of town, on the main east-west highway within the clearly developed boundaries of Aristopolis. It had been cleared and leveled, and marked with cornerstones. The trio quickly constructed a wood and cobble castle, and plastered it with satirical signs referencing Gondolin, HCF, and the resistance, and claiming a state variously called Ondolin, Nondolin, and Fondlin.

The next day a citizen asked me and some councilors to see something, and led us inside the castle. There was a large throne, and above a series of small rooms each labeled with the name of a Gondolin leader. More signs referenced a Kingdom, a Queen, and other elements of an independent state. The councilors were concerned by this, but I asked them not to take action, reminding them that immelol &amp; company were notorious trolls. At this point, while distasteful, nothing had been done that warranted legal response.

**tl;dr check-in: New residents use their plot to mock us and other server memes. Nothing happens.**

(edit: I had incorrectly placed this incident between visits. See Silianat's comment below for clarification.)
On the day in question, the drama began as some Aristopolitans led by unitiveshadow headed out in the nether to rescue a pearled citizen. They found Theodius on the top nether near our city's portal. As could be seen on a minimap, he was spelling out the words ""BERGE SUCKS HARD"" in lava. Unitiveshadow repeatedly asked Theodius to leave, even going so far as to travel up there and hit him, but he would not go. After some time the crew decided to leave Theodius to his griefing, but then Zombie Lenin arrived with a group in tow so they returned through the portal to Aristopolis.

Unaware of any of this, I logged in amid a conversation between Silianat (another Gondolin leader) and Zombie Lenin, who was inside the portal room with some assorted escorts of bounty hunters and the ""Trading Company"". He asked to be let into the city for a diplomatic visit. Silianat refused, citing trespassing. I asked ZL about the nature of the visit, but his company returned through the portal.

Around this time Berge arrived and took charge of the conversation. Soon the entourage reappeared on the ""Ondolin"" lot, proclaiming it a sovereign nation recognized by Buenos Aires. (It was later found that they arrived through a portal inside the castle, having just built their own in the nether between Aristopolis and Snjorlendir.) This sparked simultaneous arguments in local chat and Mumble, which continued for the next hour or so. Berge repeatedly insisted that Zombie Lenin leave, and refused to acknowledge the existence of Ondolin as anything other than a private residence.

**tl;dr check-in: ZL and friends show up for unannounced ""diplomatic visit"", bypass our portal onto private property and recognize it as a sovereign state.**

While this was going on, Silianat was blocking up their makeshift portal until igotyou came back through and he fled, digging a hole to escape. When Zombie Lenin finally decided to leave with the rest of his escort, Dethfly (one of the residents) remained behind. Berge demanded that he too leave, and when he refused pearled him briefly to take him into the nether. Around the same time ZL somehow fell to his death in the nether near our portals, possibly into the hole that Silianat had dug while fleeing from igotyou. Gondolin escorts witnessed it, expressed their disbelief, and grabbed his dropped gear. They returned to Aristopolis and stowed the items, then addressed the matter now at hand: what to do about the property known as Ondolin.

During this part I was FIOSed for about 20 minutes. I came back to find that the decision was to reclaim the property and remove the structure. It was completely dismantled and returned to the state at which ownership was granted to the residents. During and following the operation arguments continued on Mumble, as some of ZL's entourage remained in our channel and insisted that ""Ondolin"" was a perfectly legitimate sovereign state by their ""property is theft"" ideology, and we had to honor that. Needless to say the conversation didn't get anywhere. During the exchange immelol showed up, apparently neither upset or very surprised that the castle had been removed. Berge sent him away too, and he left without argument.

**tl;dr check-in: ZL falls to his death, we grab his gear. After ""diplomats"" leave, we reclaim the plot to the city and remove the offending structure. Trolls try to make us play by their rules on property claims.**

Now Aristopolis was back to normal, but on Mumble strong words were exchanged. We had ZL's gear, which his friends demanded that we return, along with insisting on Ondolin's legitimacy. At first Berge refused on the grounds that ZL dropped the items on our land while tresspassing, but eventually he decided that we would give the gear back but make no other concessions. However, ZL returned with a larger, heavily armed group before it was settled.

This time, the group consisted of the following:

* ZombieLenin
* Kempje
* NJPalms
* Theodius
* igotyou
* StarkBastard
* Konartist
* SerQwaez
* ividito
* Milzed
* pucker678
* Makanla

**tl;dr check-in: Things get heated; we are willing to return the lost gear but ZL returns and marches into the city with an assorted force to make demands of us.**

The group made their way through the private portal into the north side of the city, slowly moving south together towards downtown. Little public dialog was exchanged at this point, but ZL was still demanding the return of gear and recognition of Ondolin. Berge hastily tried to arrange the handing over of gear, but it was becoming clear that violence was imminent. Some citizens reported the group breaking into houses on the way to Berge's tower. Aristopolitans, anticipating combat, either logged out or grouped up in the town square. Berge switched over to his alt to avoid giving the enemy an objective to rally around. I stood on the ramparts of the tower to observe, unable to engage in direct PvP due to my poor connection. After a few tense minutes, Theodius hit me with an arrow and open combat immediately broke out.

The battle raged on for quite a while, with both sides taking losses. At some point Fluffy showed up, and I'm not sure even he knew which side he was on. Ultimately several Gondolindrim were pearled before the rest logged out, admitting defeat. Those of our opponents who were pearled, including Zombie Lenin, were freed as our own fighters were killed before they could secure the pearls. Following the battle, our prisoners' pearls were placed in vaults, and we were told that they would be freed in exchange for Berge's own pearl. Berge and some of the prisoners themselves rejected this offer. Our people immediately began planning to free the pearls until, unexpectedly, they were all released the following day.

**tl;dr check-in: After some posturing ZL's force initiates combat. The situation descends into chaos and many are killed/pearled. Prisoners are held for ransom of Berge's pearl.**

I won't relate the fallout of this situation and its resolution here since it unfolded more publicly here on reddit. All of our people have been freed, Zombie Lenin has fled, and while certain hard feelings remain on both sides, Aristopolis and Buenos Aires both seem to be recovering well. I hope that my report cleared up and unanswered questions, and that this rather absurd conflict can be put behind us.

**Editorialized TL;DR: Zombie Lenin has been itching for a fight for weeks and after a few failed attempts to incite our aggression, resorted to an outright invasion with an assorted team of Leningrad, rogue HCF, and others. The situation that was ultimately brought to armed conflict was a farcical secession claim of a city plot built in mockery of Gondolin. No combatants are currently being held as prisoners on either side.**

The so called ""Peace Agreement"" has gone in a number of questionable directions during the past few hours as workers have suddenly vanished from the streets at a rate not seen since someone threw a baseball at our Glorious Leader's head. The main individual leading this strange series of purges has been the mentally ""exceptional"" comrade known as Mr.Twiggy. Some have suggested that his overly paranoid self-delusional behaviors even rival that of the most greediest of Ancaps. A Leninist diplomat explains the burden of such an unstable individual by pointing out, ""If the HCF truly wants peace with the workers, it's probably best to remove the elephant in the room and yes, I'm pointing out that Comrade Mr. Twiggy is a detriment to peace in the region"". In a brief interview with the politically illiterate leader, comrade Gordge of the HCF, he explains that, ""We know that the elephant in the room is causing problems but perhaps if we just dress it up in a nicer pair of clothes while we throw diamonds at you, the problem will simply disappear"". One thing is for sure, Comrade Mr. Twiggy is a dangerous unstable individual that could potentially unravel what little peace there is.

Now hiring a PR agent! The HCF appear to be having trouble understanding the benefits of good PR and understanding the troubles that persist with bad PR. It seems that even the best PR agent cannot manage to help the war driven savages of the HCF. In an exclusive interview with Comrade Pikachu, he insists that, ""The very idea of PR is foreign to many HCF members so it's frankly not surprising that they care little what others think of them"".

A glorious victory for the Democratic People's Republic of Buenos Aires! After an incompetent HCF member stepped on our Glorious Leader's favorite pair of shoes, a brief conflict arose as rioters took to the streets chanting anti-HCF slogans. Many decried the HCF utter disrespect of their favorite Civcraft statesman and threatened to close access to the 0,0 region if the HCF didn't compensate for their actions. After a tense standoff, the HCF members agreed to a 10 diamond block compensation to the damaged shoes in return for an end to hostilities.

1354918584.0,41,self.Civcraft,14guay,On the banning of RattlerTank,55,14,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/14guay/on_the_banning_of_rattlertank/,"First of all I would like to apologize for creating yet another thread on this issue, I would like to avoid filling up the sub with multiple threads on the same debate, but if Rattler wishes to play the 'lets publicly attack the admins' game I am afraid I must respond in an equally public manner or be forced to fight an uphill battle for visibility. 

As for your complaint about not being presented with all the evidence against you that is because Exultant, who has handling this issue with my guidance, is currently asleep and thus not in any particular condition to respond to the quite lengthy modmail thread on this subject. Most of the admins are currently very busy with finals at the moment, I myself was busy for most of today with the intent of responding in detail to your question after my final for the day. I am sorry for the delay, but coming to the conclusion that we are refusing you evidence after we don't respond for just 3 hours and resorting to public attack is unjustified. 

Now, lets get down to the meat of this issue, what sort of threat is cheating to the server? Obviously it distorts the game world through actions that would otherwise be impossible. 

So what then is the most dangerous type of cheating? What distorts the game world most? 

To most people, the immediate image brought to mind is of the most blatant cheats, flyhacking, duping, invulnerability, or the famous god books incident. Yet historically those have been very unsuccessful. I mean going down the list, the last flyhacker was banned in 30 minutes, the last duper less than 24 hours, the last fastbreak 0 minutes (it was stopped and reversed in progress), the god books incident was handled in 15 minutes. 

And for all of these incidents it was easy to track, remove, reverse, and understand the results. Almost counterintuitively it is the most powerful hacks that are the weakest at actually affecting the server game world in persistent manner. 

If it is not the most powerful hacks that represent the most danger to the game world, what is it? What has the possibility of doing more damage than those oh so famous incidents? 

The answer is subtlety itself. The hacks that are the most dangerous are not the ones that let a player break a block instantly, but let them break it a quarter of a second faster. Not the ones that let them do infinite damage, but the ones that make them strike just a little faster and just a little more accurately. Not the ones that let them fly, but the ones that let them run just one step ahead of anyone else. 


When you give an already good player just that little bit extra the game changes,  a step, sword swing, potion, or block break ahead of everyone else makes a good player into a legendary player. Gives them the power to shape the game world illegitimately without anyone ever noticing. With the patience and skill to wield them the small hacks make all the difference in the world. 

The story as I know it goes like this, last night RattlerTank for reasons I have ignored due to their irrelevance to the matter at hand went toe to toe with 10 of the servers best equipped and most skilled players and not only gave them a run for their money, but made it out alive despite being outnumbered 10 to 1 and outgunned.   

A rousing underdog story, everyone enjoys it at the theater and goes home. Its only after the show that people sit down and think just how unlikely it all was, that the hero could always be that one step faster, never faltering and avoiding the one imperfection in action that would be fatal.  

RattlerTank is asking us to show him the smoking gun, but as I hope I have made clear in my excessively verbose lead up to my conclusion no such smoking gun exists and that is both what makes the possibility that we are right in suspecting him of cheating most pressing and the possibility that we are wrong most disturbing.   

Is what RattlerTank did last night impossible? I don't know, its the in the grey area between human and super human where we can't quite be certain if what we are seeing is fact or fiction. NoCheat is as it always must be, used to assist and not create conclusions. With the combination of improbable achievements spread before me my conclusion is that there is something fishy going on. A ban was not even proposed until I asked Exultant to further investigate the issue. 


So then what should our decision be? If we are right then we have saved the server from the most insidious type of cheating, if we are wrong we have banned someone for nothing more than being too good.  

Every one of the involved admins is very much on the fence about this issue and we are still working on talking it out, we apologize for setting Rattler in limbo as real life responsibilities take precedent over a speedy internet trial but there is not much we can do to avoid that.  

Many of you may remember an issue very similar to this one, Scylla and crew was always just a little better and faster than everyone else. They held the whole server in fear, to this day I have found no smoking gun for them either, just a series of nigh impossible escapades. Even with the 20/20 vision provided by hindsight the grey area there refuses to resolve into black and white. 

As with that situation, all we can do here is look at the facts and come to a judgement.

Its with this in mind that I motion the other admins for the release of Rattler followed by close observation into the future.

So after much consideration, and some fairly strange events today, including the presence of a Kinetic_VVaffle (with two Vs) account in the Jacks Hold, as the official banker/meth lab overseer of the Jacks, I decided to move the diamonds/pearls from the vault. This individual was too much of a liability, and clearly had some form of endgame, the goals of which $20 had been put towards to register a minecraft account. I'm not sure what his plan was, but either way, I did not wish to risk it.

As I was doing this, I was informed by Alexzandria that Wildcard had, the previous day, lost over 400 diamonds, 15 stacks of experience, high level enchanted armour and weapons sets, and 200 iron blocks, by leaving it in a chest in the open of the LAFLs area (Large Area of Flat Land) that he had made as some kind of secondary hold, putting strain on the resources for the main hold and using every piece of fuel we could acquire, rather than finishing the main hold, development of which has been at a standstill.

Alexzandria also expressed frustration in the hold's build, the lack of activity, the senseless actions of other leaders, and how the whole pearling of the Nazi thing was just getting ridiculous, and how the whole thing seemed to be falling apart. She said that the Nazis should be released, and we discussed disbanding The Jacks. 

I'd already gotten to work getting the diamonds out, as I did not know how well this guy knew the hold- he knew enough to glitch in using a blatant security flaw in the overhang of the hold from the fortified lower segment, and walked through it freely. As far as I was concerned, every diamond in that Hold, and pearl, may be compromised, as myself being the Jack of Diamonds, if someone was sleepy/didn't look to carefully, this guy could do anything.

So I removed the diamonds, and the pearls, to a safe location. At which stage, I considered what Alexzandria had said, about how one of the leaders had just wasted over a tenth of our wealth, how we were discussing the way the Jacks had deviated from that initial Nine meeting where we had discussed no permenant imprisonment, and how we had become an organization so far from it's roots. 

So, I freed the Nazi-Now-Prussians, releasing them all. The diamonds are taken, and safe. By my calculations, the three main contributors to this amount are Skywalker, Sigbjorn and myself, though many of the other Jacks have helped out. My current thoughts are to privately split these diamonds with those who have contributed, via dead drop points I would PM the co-ordinates to, on the conditions that they are not used to fund yet another permanent imprisonment war effort.

Due to my speed of accessing the vault, I was accused of using a hacked client shortly afterwards. Alexzandria did not seem to understand that I had taken the pearls earlier when we were talking, and could not put two and two together. I advised her to stay out of the way, however she impeded me from freeing the griefers captured by the Jacks- as some of these are also being held for excessive periods of time, and have mostly quit the server.

At present, all Prussians are free, and all pearls are removed from the Hold, with zero casualties. A large sum of these diamonds liberated will also be paid to those who have been wronged by the Jacks.

In the words of Noxy, when discussing these events, ""This is just a game, Kinetic... but I'm disappointed in you.""

It is just a game, and I am disappointed in you, Jacks. You started so well, filled with the urge to make a really fun war on this server. It was going to be a great skirmish, we had so much fun... and then you reduced us to a culling in the night, and blowing a beautiful city to ruins. You didn't just pearl them, you stopped dozens of people playing at all, ruining a wonderful facet of civcraft before it started. You then stated that it was done more because of the military threat of 30 people working together so quickly, an ulterior motive which so many loyal Jacks members were blind to. You didn't do it because it was the ""right thing to do"", you did it because you didn't want anyone to challenge your throne, and you know it as well as the rest of us now do.

We could have had so much fun. You said that I destroyed three months of hard work? There hasn't been a block placed in that fortress since the Prussians were pearled, and you know it. Without a war, you're nothing. It's time this server moved on. 

To those griefers/others pearled by Jacks I did not free, who were hidden by Alexzandria in her attempts to stop me, I am truly sorry. I could not save you too in time, and I can only hope that as the Jacks continue to disband, you will given the freedom you deserve.

1375881756.0,38,self.Civcraft,1jvqly,[FactoryMod Proposal] Drama Factory (Already coded!),50,12,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1jvqly/factorymod_proposal_drama_factory_already_coded/,"###The Problem


A significant component that I see missing from CivCraft is that there is no competition for limited economic resources. There are rarely situations where there is zerosum competition over harvesting resources in game. This is opposed to the real world where resources such as fish populations, water tables and the global atmosphere are shared between multiple groups of people, and exploitation by one group negatively affects usage by others. I would like to see similiar situations arise within CivCraft.

###The Solution

To this end I have coded a slightly different kind of factory into FactoryMod and would like peoples opinions on it.

The Drama Factory, or more specifically a global resource pool factory, is a factory where the efficiency of production is affected by the total number factories of that type which exist. This is implemented by scaling the output of such factories by 1/(# of Factories in existance), such that the first factory may produce 100 XP bottles, but once 5 of those factories are constructed each will only produce 20 XP bottles, destroying a factory removes it from this count. To further increase the interaction between factory owners, each factory will report the locations of all other factories of that type. It is my hope that these mechanics will impose interesting problems for the entire population to address, since it introduces resources over which it is hard to claim ownership, however the greatest profit from these resources will be gained when there is the least amount of conflict. Really I just want to see some kick ass resource based drama.

###The Details

I have structed the economics of the first rendition of this type of factory differently than past factories. For an intial test I would like to focus on a factory that can generate XP for free. The initial cost of the factory will be 10 stacks of XP, and repair costs will be 4 stacks/month (40% rather than the normal 10%). Its one recipe will produce 7 stacks of XP at the cost of no inputs and no fuel, however the recipe will take an entire week to complete. Additionally, since this is a Drama Factory, the 7 stacks is a global output, so if 7 factories exist in the world, each will only be able to produce 1 stack each week.

I have structured this factory differently since its purpose is different than currently implemented factories. It exists to place multiple groups of people in conflict over a limited resource. For example, once more than 7 factories exist it will actually be impossible to break even on factory repairs even with continuance use, this is one reason why I overemphasized repair costs. The lengthy recipes will also make protecting your factories be more important, as opposed to having the ability to quickly build a factory, take advantage of it and then not care as much if someone comes and destroys it; higher repair costs also motivate protection of ones factories. I have removed input and fuel costs since I think the higher repair costs serve a similiar role, since these factories are likely to be in constant use, and including inputs and fuel simply complicates the design and demphasizes the cost of fixing a factory someone else has destroyed. Lastly, I do not believe free resource generation will lead to inflationary issues since there is an absolute limited global production amount, preventing exponential resource gain.
 

###Your Input

I would love to hear peoples input on the overall proposal, how best to introduce this to the game, the structure of the costs for the factory, and scaling of the suggested numbers. Particularily when it comes to scaling things I think my numbers may be a bit off.

Many have left the city to escape the looting, griefiing, pearlings... and they're only a few of us still here not covered in Prot IV and trying to PvP in the center of town. Most of the buildings are burned down, DRO is still everywhere, and yet we're still here.
*I first joined Kappi when SoapBucket announced he needed laborers to dig out 0,0. I jumped at the chance to have even iron, as I was just hours into the server. He paid me better than fair wages, and also gave me a free plot in town. Soap has been an excellent leader in the town: cooling hot heads who wanted to start wars out of boredom and helping less wealthy players with mining and gathering resources...
*I first met Supposed the following week, when he was chasing a player who had attacked Narnia. He asked if I wanted to join, and then began a half-hour chase of a griefer. Over the next few weeks, as many of you know,Supposed traveled to various towns to pearl players who were attacking and destroying towns.  
*I am admittedly a ""new friend."" I did not play on 1.0, and have no idea about the rivalries and grudges made during that map.

Kappi has been hit hard, and I doubt whether or not I'll even still be in the overworld by the morning and not pearled to the end, but for a few of us left, we're going to try to rebuild what was destroyed, and protect what little is left. Every hour it seems someone else declares themselves ""KING"" or someone comes along and starts another fire, but we're still here... because

-------

------

* This time I double and triple checked that the chunks in question are fixed and I am very sure they are. Furthermore we think we have identified the source of our problem in NCP and we think we have disabled it. So, Hopefully(TM) things will run just fine today. Edit: Actually we updated NCP, the author found and corrected the bug quite quickly once it was reported. 

* Please report any issues you have right away so that I can track down anything I forgot while getting this setup configured correctly again or maybe something simply lost in transit, although rsync is tcp so that should not happen. 

* Updated Factorymod, should fix a bug where factories did not degenerate correctly and another bug where their output was not made correctly. 


* Updated Dyncap to a new version, has fancy features like estimated time through the queue and gives players access to the /getqueuesize or /gqs command to see how many players are waiting at the door. 

* I tried messing with the nocheat settings to get the block reappearing thing to go away, its definitely software at this end so tell me if it worked.

* As I have discussed in previous change logs it seems that software optimization goes a lot further than hardware optimization when it comes to what we are doing. This begs the question of if it is a better investment to rent better hardware or put that same money towards development of optimizations. [Intreppid](https://www.intreppid.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0) seems reasonable, but its more than $100 more a month than we are paying now. DDOS protection at Javapipe is about $100 a month, so not expensive at all compared to other providers. Also Intreppid is really just a Stammius reseller, and Stammius charges an arm and a leg for DDOS protection so it makes me kinda suspicious. 


* Decreased hostile mob spawn cap from 20 to 15 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing as well as a entry limit. 

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make? 



* I would like to thank all of you, thank you for your help and support, have fun.

As some of you may have read in the daily update, I created the config for the map that is currently running on Civtest. I would appreciate if you could provide feedback/issues in this thread so I can see it in a more consolidated method. I have made a few of these maps in the past but there is still a lot to learn from the process. Exploration is a bit rough atm because it appears none of the map was pregenned so chunks are loading as you run around for the first time. Any feedback is appreciated even if we don't end up going with a config I create as I want to make better ones in the future and I don't get a lot of opportunities for feedback.

**Some info about the map:**   

-The ore is currently set at 25% of vanilla except diamonds which are 5%   
-
-I forgot to remove emeralds in this latest iteration because it was 5am and I was tired. Act as if they aren't there because they are simple to remove.  
- 
-I introduced a much tamer version that I had initially prepared after seeing how many people preferred vanilla terrain. I hope to try to cater to both interests by providing and interesting terrain while still keeping it calm mountain wise.  
-
-Flat bedrock as requested by admins to avoid future vault issues
-   

-Currently using 18 custom biomes along with the 22 basic biomes   
-
-I have 92 biomes downloaded on my computer but some are far from traditional terrain that some players may not like. I could always turn the rarity on these WAY down so that they could be sort of ""wonders of the world"" 
-

**Issues I have been told about:**    

-Random wool blocks on the mountain
-


**EDIT, for the conspiracy theorists:**   To put any worry aside, and ttk can confirm this. I did not provide the map nor would I for the real map. This is a simple config file that with his permission could easily be made public so people can see the details of the biomes and it would be fair for everyone, although it is fun to explore with no knowledge of what you will find. I have already described the ore distribution above and veins could be added by admins at a later date. There is literally nothing I could do here to alter this. It is a plugin anyone can download and run. All I did was alter config files.

1366649862.0,44,self.Civcraft,1cvfd9,Only YOU can stop downvoting!,80,36,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cvfd9/only_you_can_stop_downvoting/,"For most of its existence, this subreddit was moderated with a light touch. ttk2 had a natural reluctance to remove posts and comments and the public mood was against anything that could be seen as censorship.

As in many things,  we have been a victim of our own success. This subreddit now has more than 4000 subscribers and often has more than 100 active viewers at any time. Many of these people, myself included, created their reddit accounts for Civcraft. 

Downvoting is extremely common here. There are a couple of reasons for this.

1. It's called 'voting', and we think of voting as a way of expressing a preference, as if a vote is our way of showing our agreement or disagreement with the _content_ of a post or comment. 

Reddit itself has a different assumption; the system considers a vote as an expression of the _appropriateness_ of a post or comment. Because of this, heavily downvoted posts are automatically hidden by the system. Heavily-downvoted messages are partially hidden and need to be expanded to be seen. People who receive lots of downvotes are automatically limited in how much and how frequently they can reply to other people. 

2. While the subreddit was much less moderated, the moderators encouraged Downvoting. _""Don't complain to us about a junk post,  just downvote it and it will disappear""_. This makes sense but was probably seen as tacit approval to some people to keep downvoting things they disagreed with. 

Throughout the original HCF invasion I routinely upvoted posts from HCF members making threats or demands. I did this for two reasons. First, they were obviously relevant information and not spam or pointless contributions.  Secondly, I wanted people to see them. Some of the stupidest posts made by HCF members were downvoted past threshold in seconds, meaning most people never saw them. That's a problem for everyone, including those people who were fighting them. 

We've recently moved to a more active form of moderation. Jokes and memes can go to [civchan](http://Chan.civcraft.vg) instead. 

So two pleas:

The first plea is to stop downvoting posts and comments that contain content. If you disagree with a post,  say so. Argue. Make your views know and win people over to your side. Downvoting __posts__, especially, is problematic because they can disappear without a trace. People with unpopular views shouldn't be censored by a tyranny of the majority either. 

The second plea is necessary because obviously some people won't really listen to the first plea. It's to the few hundred daily readers:

Upvote more! Upvote posts especially that contain useful, interesting, worthwhile, important or unpopular content. It's rare for a useful post to get more than 20 downvotes. You can help maintain a good level of debate by upvoting those posts and comments that keep a conversation moving. If you _must_ downvote, save it for unfunny jokes and memes and useless messages that only say things like ""qq"".

If everyone gets into this habit then we can all stop seeing the number of votes as a measure of popularity but rather of relevance. Hopefully this will make the subreddit more useful for everyone.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_1cvfd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cvfd9/only_you_can_stop_downvoting/,moderator

* Self posts only. No links to imgur, youtube, etc. This diminishes the amount of low content shitposting, and takes away the karma motivation to post stupid shit.

* Stricter moderation. Policies such as restricting speech (want to be edgy, go on civchan and do it there) and removing posts which add nothing to discussions such as links to joke images would go far in making the subreddit a more constructive place to discuss things, and would create a better image for those visiting the subreddit than 'a server for edgy kids to be racist and talk shit about each other.

* Some form of linking between IGNs and reddit accounts. I know something like this is in the works, and swhell has made a plugin for the purpose of identifying fake alt reddit accounts. The reasons for this should be clear.

* Disabling of downvote arrows. I know this is incredibly easy to bypass, but it provides that little bit more disincentive to try and bury posts that you disagree with/are made by someone you don't like.

* Some sort of basic courtesy ruleset on the sub - no straight up insulting each other, no mocking of someone without very good reason, etc. This one is probably my weakest point, but I think it would make the sub a nicer place to post on in general, and if you can't restrain your hatred, civchan is there to cater for you.

I decided to go exploring, near Jacks hold (Notsoblue and i explored there 12 hours ago, but then i had to log) a bit after exploring the nearby jungle biome saw a city with a nice gateway.

This city is called Blackstone keep, Known for its beautiful Dragon Gateway.

So, i walked forward a bit, and saw a dirt and wood stepping case (not stair blocks, so i had to hope (some people are terrible architects)

I noticed there was much gerfing around, and my greeting of ""Hue"" did not go unheard...  so later i said ""Hue""

Kempje replied ""lel""

As my memory serves correct Kempje is affiliated with a known group of rampant gerfers!  Most of these gerfers have a grudge against BSK because of the fact that BSK opened its doors to many Valentian refugees that moved there after their home Valenti was gerfed.  other members of the gerfer group simply want their gerfer bretherin whosnick released.  and others even simply want to just humiliate the former Valentians in an act of ""we have you pearls now"".  **Added** some of the gerfers just hate and have hated BSK Prior to February 26th **End Added**

So, i confronted kempje (a man who on the reddit seems reasonable) about his actions, then found out that Palms, Foogoot, serverror404 and the man who personally pearled me not even 3 days ago called Xtrainius were also present, i continued talking to palms and kempje in good faith, but alas, i was killed with Lava in order to prevent a tagged screen shot.

If only i had not put these people on /ignore  the way that the community says you should deal with harassment, i may have had better luck understanding which threats were used by which members of the gerfer group.

Many buckets were used, and as you can see, a few members of this gerfer squad started laval gerfing BSK.

I am still waiting for manintime's config.yml(i really hope he is actully working on it...haven't had much time to talk to him lately)

However lets get too it.

You've probably heard of FactoryMod, so you might be thinking. What is this mod? How can i use it? Well I'll try to at least explain how it works too you in this very thread!

Step 1:

Aqquire a crafting table, furnace, chest and a stone spade.

Step 2:

Place the blocks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6FCK8Mn.png) (the furnace and chest's location can be swapped, but make sure that the crafting table is in the middle)

Step 3:

Insert the factory ""build recipe"" into the chest, in my testing example it is [a stack of smoothstone, and 10 diamonds.](http://i.imgur.com/UeHEZvY.png)

Step 4:

Left click the crafting table with a stone spade, you should now get a chat message telling you what kind of factory you made, in my example i made a [workshop](http://i.imgur.com/KTBNsP2.png).

Step 5:

You now have a factory! Hurray! Now how can you use it you might ask? Well I'll tell you how! Simply left click the crafting table with a stone spade, this will [switch between](http://i.imgur.com/Ppo6zUb.png) the [different recipes](http://i.imgur.com/1hSgmvu.png)

Step 6:

Once you've found the desired recipe, make sure that there is [coal in the furnace](http://i.imgur.com/J17Yr50.png), then simply left click(again with a stone spade) the furnace, the factory will then tell you [what that recipe needs.](http://i.imgur.com/aTDfioN.png)

Step 7:

Once you've inserted both coal and the recipe's [required materials](http://i.imgur.com/RzfzXtB.png). Simply left click the furnace(you guessed it, with a stone spade) and turn the [factory on](http://i.imgur.com/aiTa4GH.png)!

Step 8:

Wait, if you get bored of waiting, you can left click the chest to [see the progress](http://i.imgur.com/HDrrMzr.png).

Step 9:

??? PROFIT! After the factory is done, [it will put the recipe output into the chest](http://i.imgur.com/T2jnOBt.png)!

Now in case you did not catch it in the first paragraph, all of these values, and recipes are for testing purposes only, i hope that manintime will have the config.yml done for civtest, and then I'll try to get a write up of the tech tree done(unless of course he's nice enough to do that).

My storeroom's walls are 2-3 blocks thick to prevent pearling through, and encased completely in reinforced Obsidian. Except one just one block of the wall on the East end of the store room. This single block was the only block you'd be able to pearl through since it was one block thick.

Ancrapz entered the snitch field, dug to this spot, and pearled through it **in less than 2 minutes.** There is no way that he'd know he'd be able to pearl through that spot without xray in that amount of time.

The obsidian wall itself gave no clues that this part of the wall was 1 block thick as the surrounding obsidian was lined up with it. All of the obsidian was reinforced with the same material. 

The building also has a layer of obsidian that extends 20-30 blocks out from the storeroom, two layers below the surface. Ancrapz found a hole in the obsidian layer, dug straight down through it, and then proceeded to dig straight to the one block thick wall.

And he did this all in less than 2 minutes.

The storeroom's dimensions are roughly 20x30 blocks, and 7 blocks tall. The chance to find this vulnerability is 1 in 5208. 

If this break-in took more than two minutes I could see a defense. If you break a reinforced block it shows the one behind it. However, he dug straight to it not attempting any other route.

Right before he broke into my store room he was on the other end of town breaking chests. 

**Pretty pictures:**

* [One block thick wall point](http://i.imgur.com/tZTSJmR.png). I had dug the obsidian out a bit more to figure out what Ancrapz had done, but when I found the break in, it was a tunnel leading directly to the pearlable wall. Also there were no torches.

* [The one block removed revealing chest behind it.](http://i.imgur.com/5AOqqkb.png) You can pearl through a 1 block thick wall with a chest because it's considered an entity not a block.

* [Diagram marking out how thick the wall is.](http://i.imgur.com/0lTbOGV.png) The blocks highlighted in green show the obsidian that's aligned with it. There is no visible indication from the outside that this point in the wall is one thick.

Additional information:

Ancrapz has been breaking into houses in my town for months managing to find hidden chests and vaults.

[He found a temporary vault just built by another town member and dug straight down into it.](http://i.imgur.com/XGOGsTE.png) This vault was located away from any building and not lit.

[He then escaped by digging straight down into the floor of the vault to a natural cave system.](http://i.imgur.com/ub8mSx8.png)

[He didn't use torches](http://i.imgur.com/FnUrcoc.png)

[The cave connected to a 2x1 tunnel he dug](http://i.imgur.com/lHbhM0E.png). Torches were there from previous exploration.

[Leading right to a mineshaft ladder to the surface](http://i.imgur.com/lBjL4q4.png) http://i.imgur.com/20kgcN6.png

This happened on November 28th and they didn't have snitch evidence. However he did show up on other snitches and was the only one in town at the time when the damage occurred.

Anecdotal Evidence:

I almost caught Ancrapz a couple months ago, but he managed to escape by digging straight down into a 2x1 unlit mine shaft, run out of radar range and log off.

1359731240.0,43,self.Civcraft,17p2vq,Pearling cost discussion part II: The resurrection ,49,6,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17p2vq/pearling_cost_discussion_part_ii_the_resurrection/,"Right now due to life in general I have very little free time and most of that is spent directing projects for and around Civcraft by email and other means. As such I think it would be best to spread the discussion about Pearling mechanics over a few threads and a few days so that I can respond in proper fashion to what I glean from the previous thread. With that in mind lets launch right into the discussion. 

On of the primary objections I noticed was that there needed to be a real death mechanic, I wanted to write about that, and in fact had even started a section on it after the conclusion of last nights post but I had not the time. The problem with prisonpearl is that it has been a combined prison and death mechanism for the life of the server, ideally such things would be split so that we could make prisonpearl a more realistic prison mechanic with interfering with the death portion of its functionality. But the problem with that is apparent, mainly that the minute such a death mechanic exists it will become the ultimate goal of all fights, even when it really should not be. This is both an effect of the people involved (which I have no issue with) and the fact that Civcraft is a videogame, and game mentality will make it a given in any situation that the death mechanic is the goal. 

In short no one would use prisonpearl because why imprison when you can kill? 

Edit: I should not that I am not addressing non-stackable items a fuel and/or any cost *above* 8 coal pear day because I want there to still be a 'death' mechanic in that you can keep someone pearled forever without looking at them, what I mean by that is placing one guy in a double chest and filling it with coal/whatever resource we end up using. At 424 days with the current cost that is really paying a large upfront cost to pearl someone effectively forever and hell even a regular player can scrounge a chest full of coal pretty quickly, the point of this is that yes you can still perma perl someone pretty trivially, just not a ton of people. 

Onto the cost mechanic, the reason coal was selected was exactly because it was nonrenewable, we had no desire for one individual to build a bedrock to heightlimit automated wheat farm and get enough bread to feed his hundred prisoners for a year all at once. We have considered more difficult to acquire renewibles but anything that encourages more grinding needs to be avoided for server performance reasons. Cakes are a poor idea because they eliminate far too much time flexibility regardless of how much resources you are willing to put into producing them, costly stackable food would be better, but not something that encourages more and more farming, so fish essentially is the only renewable cost worth discussing. 

I am fully open to decreasing the fuel requirements, as they may be more reasonable and tuned for an environment without so many trivial griefers, maybe where there was some extra barrier to entry it would be a very good balance. But ultimately the point is to remove one man justice, Batman can defeat all the criminals he wants but its the police that have to sweep in and clean up after him. 

For an organized city or group it should be no problem at all collecting enough in taxes, fees, etc, to fund however many prisoners you have (within reason) if this is not true then the value does need to be lowered, but no matter what large numbers of pearls will scale even a truly trivial cost into astronomical levels, this is the point of the mechanic. 

If you are opposed to mechanics that require taxation or organization then you fail to understand the challenge that Civcraft presents, its one so difficult that no one has actually done it yet, it is the unanswered question of the experiment, *can you really organize? really create a leadership, fund efforts, build a true nation or society that solves not just the easy problems like ""Whoo we wrote a Constitution!"" but the hard ones.* ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1359753172.0,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_17p2vq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17p2vq/pearling_cost_discussion_part_ii_the_resurrection/,moderator

&gt;**Society**: The aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.


So far there has been only one sort of order on this server, provided by the so called 'world police'. They, in an act of incredible generosity, paid the price, thousands upon thousands of diamonds for justice. They stood between all the little communities of this server and the reality that *justice is not free*. While other groups have called themselves separate societies they never paid the cost for their own defense, they never really held any power, not because it was taken from them, but because they refused to pay the price to create it. 



Now you are truly facing the challenge proposed by the sidebar, the one many have long claimed Civcraft lacked simply because they never noticed it was solved for them. 


Your shield has been removed, your benefactors are gone. If you want to survive you have only two options. 


You can hide like animals in a map so large you will never be found, or you can step up to face the reality that even the incredible charity of your benefactors was not enough to fund a true defense and if you ever want to see justice again you are going to need to start small and *pay for it*. 


Regardless of if your method of payment is taxes, insurance bills, or communal ownership whatever societies you build require funding for their defense, leadership for that defense, and limits to their jurisdiction. If they hope to be respectively prepared, effective, and not succumb to the free rider problem. 


Make citizenship matter, citizens pay taxes, in return the city defense force will free them and protect land they have in the city and only land they have in the city any force that attempts to defend the entire map will find themselves overwhelmed and/or seen as a threat to the sovereignty of other organizations.
 

Replace the right words here with ‘commune’ or ‘private defense agency’ and you have the alternatives. But the fact remains that expecting a single group, with only charity for funds, to defend the entire server is the exact folly, the exact doge of Civcraft's innate challenge that brought you to this point. Justice is not free, so learn to pay for it, or watch chaos reign.

But we have begun to reach the limits of shoe strings and we must either stagnate or move beyond them. 

Civcraft could be so much more, I think we all realize that, we barley got our core plugins coded and some of them are not even fleshed out or balanced and just that start brought us this far, with some real polish the game play experience could be taken to a whole different level. I created Civcraft with the goal of more than just a great game, but also an educational tool that made people question the world and how they could shape it. I don't think we have even seen the beginning of the true appeal of that idea. 

The next logical step is for us to increase our player count as well as continue to better balance our mods. To do that former we require significant funds, and the latter presents a different difficulty. With the fast approaching release of the new modding api the Minecraft server community faces a split, the open source community, which will probably be headed by Afortress (coder of spout) wants to code from the ground up their own MC server software (presumably in C) while the majority of smaller serves and non open source die-hards will be sticking with Mojang official software. The choice for us is apparent, a server coded in C is just too good to pass up. 

But as we widen the gap even further Minecraft vanilla a very long term question comes up, the question of if we should someday split from Minecraft entirely to bring Civcraft into a game in its own right. 

I would like to start making posts to /r/Minecraft and/or /r/Politics in the near future, as if it does not look like we can afford more slots before posting there we may as well tackle the chicken and egg problem headfirst by doing things live. It may not be pretty, but I think it would work out well over the course of a few months. 

So, that's where things stand.

And for the excuse of ""I was new:"" In what world is it okay to kill and grief and trespass the first people/city you see and then expect cupcakes and friendship afterwards?

Also, doesn't each City get to determine how they handle prisoners? So in theory, a city can have a zero tolerance policy, and lock you away forever because you stole glowstone and cake. There's no server-wide rules that say you get a trial, or that it takes a certain amount of griefs per cinemeter to earn permanent imprisonment.

----

* The testing server is now updated to 1.5.2, the only problem we still have seems to be an odd stack trace from Realistic Biomes, there is a thread about it in the development mailing list. What I need is a build of RealisticBiomes based off of the new async growth code and with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1e85on/first_pass_on_balancing_of_xp_recipes/) config. Actual research for balance is highly encouraged and will be used. 

* [JukeAlert](https://github.com/erocs/JukeAlert) finally got the start of its Async changes and with some fixes should be able to get a working build pretty quickly. 

* With that in mind I am going to try and setup a deadline, my goal is to have our last hurrah on this map on saturday and promote this testing server to a full blown Civtest on Sunday, marking the start of our first round. Provided no problems the map placed online then will be the final one. If there are problems we always reserve the right to try again. 

* To note the distinction, what we have right now is a testing server, not a Civtest, testing servers are there to make sure things don't explode, Civtests are to actually test things like social impacts and changes. 

* Exactly how plentiful are spawners at the moment? As far as I am aware they are at 1/4th or 1/6th vanilla levels, which would make it practical to allow vanilla xp gain since it is effectively nerfed by low dark spawn rate and lack of spawners.

 
* Apparently [this mod](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/firstjoinplus/) would allow us to spawn a book in the inventory of everyone who joined, once I write up my offical guide to Civcraft 2.0 in the style of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/rmbgm/you_wake_up_in_an_unfamiliar_place_a_guide_to/) legendary post I guess I could simply copy and paste it into game and set it to duplicate on first login. Of course if everyone has a copy of this it will probably end up making a doorstop everywhere. 


* If you wish to help out Civcraft we are always looking for developers and testers, please talk to me about getting added to the development google group if you have an interest and some experience in programming.

* So, the day before the Red Letter day, saturday if the current plan holds out, will be the last day running this map and on that day I would like to give a speech in game somewhere.

1 concentrate all your interweb frustration, all your angst, I want it all, here, right now.

No seriously, I come home to pop on the reddit, open that shit up, and what is it filled with?

Its filled with the same bullshit, that it always is when people dont get there fucking way.

You think anyone wants to hear about your fucking pleas the the public about your unjust bannings?

Fuck no.

What the fuck do you think its going to accomplish?

Oh man, you banned me wrongly man, I totally never fucking did this.

Obviously the more I bitch, the moar I moan, this unjust, hastily decision making admin team will change their minds.

Oh better yet, instead of having possibly a mumble conversation with the man, privately over these things, instead of privately messaging the team, or using modmail, lets fucking bitch on the reddit, upvote ourselves to the top, downvote the very same motherfucker your trying to appeal your ban to.

Cause thats going to fucking work.

Better yet, banned players, you know who im talking about, yankees, prerequisite, why don you fucking get the hell out.

popping in every now and then to say some witty bullshit that contributes absolutely nothing, especially to your own prediciment, go fuck yourselves.

Heres a special fuck you.

This fuck you is dedicated to the motherfuckers who live, whose sole goddamn contribution 95% of the time, is to bitch, criticise, and moan about admin crimes, admin abususes.

Fuck ya, to those special motherfuckers that pop up every now and then, I want to personally say to you all, go take a flying fucking leap, and go fuck yourselves.

Corrupt admins?

Leave.

Admin decision not go in your favor?

Cant deal with the decision?

Leave.

Want to complain about the balances of the server, the admins, favortism, ancap fucking advantage, and you offer nothing as to the solutions?

Leave, actually, leave and go fuck yourself.

If you cant handle the fact that decisions made, at this point, are made privately, amongst the owner, and even a small group of consultants, then you either gotta find another server, or put your own damned work into this shit.

I dont contribute nothing to the development team, to its mods, or the upkeep of the server, and at this point I havent even been able to donate.

But to think this motherfucker, ttk2 has kept this server, which has generated thousands of unique users, hundreds of hours of unique motherfucking game time, handled every controversial decision ever made, having to dedicate large sums of his private time as to keep you motherfuckers, you motherfucking complaining pieces of shits content, seriously, go. fuck. yourself.

The best damn argument, love it or leave it bitch.

If you want to actually help, actually contribute your own time to keeping this shit ran smoothly, without bias, Id have all the more respect for ya.

But to those special few, the ones that feel they have a right to this service, a right to this free service, ran and upkept  by motherfuckers who get no reward, who alot of the time work behind the scenes to keep your shit running smoothly, and when something goes astray, something isnt just quite right, gets a shitpost.

Your the kind of tpeople I despise, from the bottom of my heart, wish you would go fuckyourselves.

Whats the point of this post?

No clue.

Like I said I come home to see shit on the front page, whining shit, from people I could give two fucks about.

And to see the dozens of fucking upvotes and downvotes, flung shit everywhere.

It pisses me off.

I miss the early days of this server, smaller community, alot less shit flinging, it was a good place to be, like living in a small town.

Now its like a fucking metropolis.u got the few good here and there, the wandering travelers, the deranged and demented, but overall its filled with shit flingers.

God damn fucking based goddamn monkeys.

To all you shit flingers, I want it, concentrated right here, right now, give it to me.

You baseless fuckers.

Now that I finish writing this I wonder if this could even qualify as content on here, probably not, probably will get caught in the spam fulter or something.

Either way, someone, somewhere will see this.

With all that said, im out.

Have a good goddamn fuckin day.

To ttk, Ive never talked to ya, Ive bareley heard your voice on mumble, but I just want to say, I love your server, I love the ideas, the purpose of it. Ive been playing since the very first day when a dozen players could be on and get 5 tick. I love this place, and even with the shit flingers I love, to some extent the community ive interacted with. Keep up the work man, your doing gods work son.


Murrica, love it or leave it.

At the time this made sense, there were literally only a few dozen very active players who cared if the server lived or died and the paltry donations being made didn't dent the thousands of dollars required.

Today we have somewhere between 300-500 moderate to very active players on Civcraft, and that's just based on time spent logged in to the main server, not counting the exceptionally active meta-gaming community that participates on the sub and mumble. If each one of us donates $5 we can keep Civcraft running for _months_ while we figure out our next move.

I'll come out and say it, I love Civcraft a great deal. I've met some genuinely spectacular people here and I would hate for this mixing pot of diversity (and drama) to go away just because some butthurt new friend decided we weren't cool enough to play anymore.

Very soon we'll have been running this fascinating experiment for a whole year, if we pull toghether and help one another we can see it through another. Donate $5, a plea from your friend nickelpro.

As we all know, CivCraft is more than a game; it is an experiment. An experiment to see what will happen when Minecraft players are allowed to govern themselves, while simulating real-world mechanics. The mechanics, however, are flawed, as we have discussed countless times before, and will discuss countless time in the future. 

---

*The Movement*

In CivCraft, there is only one efficient mode of transportation, and that is Nether travel. With significantly lower travel time, especially along the Nether Highways, the Nether has evolved into the only desirable mode of transportation. Naturally, this leads to some issues in the mechanics of the experiment.

With the reduced travel time, a person can move from one side of the server to the other in  a matter of minutes, rather than hours. There is very little cost of movement. This does not accurately reflect the real world. Among other things, this creates unrealistic migration patterns. And as we see with the HCF, the movement of fighters to any city on the server is done almost effortlessly, because almost every city has a nether portal.  

There are a few solutions to this, but they would all have to wait until a map reset to be implemented. Also, all of them would put additional strain on the server. 

* The Nether should be made the same scale as the Overworld. This would, in most cases, make travel by Nether as costly as the Overworld, while allowing for resources to be gathered in it. However, I imagine having a Nether that is the same size as the Overworld map would put some unneeded strain on the server; 

* The Nether should be removed, alternative sources for the resources added, or;

* The Nether should become a prison like the End. By disabling the creation of Nether portals and having only a select few distributed across the Overworld, Nether travel would be impractical. Additionally, the Nether could be opened as an alternative prison for pearled persons. This would allow Nether resources to be gathered by prisoners the same way they are gathered in the End. It would also hinder any casual travelers.  

In addition to this, I would propose breaking up the Overworld map to make things more interesting. As boat travel would be the most efficient mode of transportation with Nether disabled, the map should be broken up into continents separated by large bodies of water. This would, realistically, make port cities more accessible and desirable, and introduce a new dynamic in the form of overseas trade. It would also give ideologies and factions more distinct lines on their areas of control. 

---

*The Military*

With the arrival of the HCF players, the role of military technology and defense systems on CivCraft have become that much more important. Unfortunately, any effective and efficient method of keeping out unwanted guests or fending them off is either not allowed due to game mechanics or has not been well developed on the server. 

In ttk2's explanation of the [philosophy](http://redd.it/rsr8c) of Citadel, he talks about how Citadel allows walls to become useful and give the defender an advantage. But it only applies when the attacking force and the defending force are both present simultaneously. In most raids on the server, this is not the case. An attacking force will simply pillar over the wall and jump down on the other side with minimal effort. Walls on the server, in most cases, seem to do nothing but provide the same sense of false security one gets from living in a gated community. Yes, there is a wall, but it won't protect you unless you are actively defending it. There ought to be a way for walls to function without requiring players to actively defend them. As for solutions, there doesn't seem to be a good one.

* Nerf pillaring to make it difficult to scale up to the height of the average wall. Of course, it would still be possible to build a simple stair case, or dig under the wall, but this would at least slow people down. However, it would negatively affect other aspects of game-play, and would probably require some sort of mod. Overall, probably not worth the cost;

* Create extremely costly and massive walls, the kind that extend from bedrock to the height limit. Of course, you would also have to enclose the roof to prevent the *very* motivated from getting in. At the very least, an effective wall would still be obscenely costly to build and protect, or; 

* Create complex defense systems to function in tandem with the walls. The kind that griefers laugh at while they dig around and steal your redstone, or avoid altogether. 

At the moment, I think we should accept that walls have very little function on the server. As for defense against attackers, it would be more cost effective and efficient to construct barriers on-site during the battle (assuming you know it's occurring). Walls are unnecessary and expensive. So what then is the best way to defend a base against an attacking force? Don't build it at ground level. It seems to be the only feasible solution. The best defense against griefers and attackers is to hide the base completely. After all, if they don't know it's there, they can't attack it. 

Defenses on CivCraft need a makeover. The aesthetically-pleasing wall is history. If you're going to be well-defended, you're going to need to do better than that. Personally, I am looking at some of the more well-defended bases (and cities) I've heard about or seen on the server, and building off of those ideas. I suggest you all do the same. 

---

*The Experiment*

As for the actual experiment, there are quite a few things that we can take away from this recent interaction with HCF fighters. It is too early to see exactly how much the HCF attacks have affected the server, but it is clear that things are changing on the server as a result. Cities are falling, new ones are rising, people are going off to hide, and others have taken up swords to defend themselves. 

With the arrival of the HCF fighters, PvP combat on the server has gone from being an unnecessary skill to being almost a requirement for movement. Before, PvP only came into play when there were griefer hunts or one faction attacked another, but it was never an important aspect, and there was always room for neutrality. If there was no room for neutrality (indiscriminate killing), the offender was usually put down quickly by those who were equipped to PvP, for the good of the server community. That tended to be the role of the 'World Police' and bounty hunters. PvP was not necessary for a majority of players because there was a universal police force that would be there to protect them. 

This universal police force allowed players to focus on the more political and societal development aspects of the game. Now that we see what has happened when they are unable to maintain control, I think we can conclude that a majority of the server relied on their assistance. Their efforts seem to be what kept the server a relatively peaceful place. But now that they have been all but eliminated by the HCF fighters, we are experiencing a extraordinary rise in crime because for the most part we were never prepared to defend ourselves. This is a mistake that we should strive to avoid in the future. Cities and factions need to start providing protection and justice for their citizens, instead of relying on the 'World Police' to do it for them.  

[When I first founded STAR, I was asked why charge for defensive services when the ""Ancaps"" will do it for free? A perfect example of how we relied too much on the 'World Police' and too little on the private sector.]

---

Another thing I think we can learn from this is that in a time of crisis, we have a tendency to try and wait it out. After all, when those committing hostilities leave no room for neutrality, there are only two options left. In this case we can fight a hopeless battle against a larger force than we can muster with greater skills than most of ours. Or we can avoid the aggressors altogether. The logical choice, clearly, is avoidance. With the options being oppression or avoidance, most of CivCraft seems to have chosen avoidance. 

The way I see it, people's avoidance of the HCF hostilities will cause one of two things to happen. Either people will be pushed away from each other, or they will become more united.

We already see that with the inability to travel, the lack of trust CivCrafters have for one another, and the numerous ideologies that already divide us, many players are retiring from the cities and towns and moving where they are isolated and safe. As I've stated before, the desirable course of action for most CivCrafters is avoidance. And many CivCrafters have found that the best way to achieve this is to retire from the server for the time being or to go off by themselves. By doing so, they reduce the risk of being attacked, as they are now both less of a target and less of a threat.

The other option is for CivCrafters to become more united. I'm not talking about some resistance against the HCF fighters. I'm talking about a resistance against ourselves; against our tendency to go into hiding and wait for the problem to end. The community that we once had, where people went about their business freely, traded, talked with other people, has been greatly diminished in-game. And it's not because we are immobile, but because we choose not to run the risk of moving.

As a result of the Nether (as I addressed above) cities were constructed too far apart for normal travel between them. We came to rely too much on the Nether, and now that we do not have access to it, we are growing apart. I think it's about time we decided to close the gap and start walking and building new towns. It is the same shock that we would get if the Nether was disabled, and we need to adapt to it, for the good of the server and the community.

1357494087.0,41,self.Civcraft,162gqh,Mining Machines: Yay or Nay?,51,10,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/162gqh/mining_machines_yay_or_nay/,"Hey y'all, I'm a fairly casual player on the server, I live in a small village in an ocean to stay away from conflict, but I genuinely enjoy the server.

After reading some of the posts from admins on this server, it seemed like there is a general desire for a higher tech tree, with more capital investment. I came up with an idea, which is sort of similar to something done in Tekkit apparently. I'll try to explain it:

You take a dispenser, place it down, and surround it with 5 iron blocks. You right click on the dispenser, and all the iron blocks disappear / are consumed, and what is left is a 'Tier 1 Mining Machine'. You can pick it up into your inventory, it is called a 'Tier 1 Mining Machine,' and you can place it down wherever. 

When you place down a Mining Machine, you can put 'fuel' in it, which could be anything. It could be iron ingots, gold ingots, redstone, coal, etc. But you place this 'fuel' inside the dispenser, you power it with redstone, and it will begin mining blocks in front of the dispenser. How far the mining goes, how fast it mines, how big the tunnels that it mines are, what kind of ores it does/doesn't drop while mining, the kind of fuel it consumes, all depends on the 'Tier' level of the machine.

Example:

A tier 1 mining machine mines a 1x1 tunnel up to 30 blocks away, at an *okay* pace. Also, if it hits diamonds, it will destroy the diamond block but it also consumes it, so it won't drop the diamond. It requires redstone for fuel and consumes 1 redstone for every block it mines. Once it mines 500 blocks, the machine will 'break', and needs to be repaired by placing an iron block beside it and clicking on it, which will then be consumed and repair it.

A tier 5 mining machine could require a tier 4 mining machine and 20 diamond blocks to upgrade it. A tier 5 machine could mine a 3x3 tunnel straight forward up to 100 blocks away, fairly quickly. The fuel it uses is 1 iron ingot for every 9 blocks mined. If it hits iron or gold ores, it will actually pop the ores out at the mining machine's location. Additionally, it will drop diamonds if it hits diamond ore. It will mine up to 5000 blocks before it 'breaks', and requires 4 diamond blocks to repair.

These are really basic examples, and ALL of it would be configurable. What blocks are required to upgrade the machine, how many mines before it breaks, how to repair it, how far it goes per tier, special cases/abilities when it hits ores, etc.

The main idea is to add a higher tech tree that players can use to mine out large areas, either for aesthetic reasons or for mining / ore gathering reasons. I could imagine huge mining operations being run by experienced players for riches, etc. I could even see special machines that players use to scout for large diamond veins.

1357374649.0,43,self.Civcraft,16013k,DEER CIVRAFT,54,11,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16013k/deer_civraft/,"So now that I'm ~~five~~ six Shiner Bochs and a Four Horseman shot into shit-faced, I feel like I can finally express some actual human emotion. I will use generalized terms here, such as ""CivCraft participants"" and ""HCF"", in a very sweeping manner, due to both my intoxication and to my lack of interest in delving into the various complexities of these groups.


I've had multiple conversations with individuals from both sides of this conflict. Obviously I have conversed with numerous individuals from the ""CivCraft"" side, whos interests include building, trading, and community-building. I've also conversed with multiple people from the ""HCF"" side, including Pikaoku, MrTwiggy, McFluffykins, prerequisite, TravisSupreme, and Yakman0. I'm generally full of shit, but I will say that I've gained a bit of empathy for both sides of this conflict, despite my relentless mockery of the latter group of players.


The ""HCF issues"" really began with the coming of MrTwiggy, whose actions on RattlerTank shook the complacency of this server. His disregard for the ""NAP"", combined with his skill at PvP, shocked the participants of CivCraft, who generally followed an agenda of non-aggression (partially due to the interventions of the ""world police""). Members of the HCF, please understand that ""hardcore PvP"" and similar ideals of total war were completely foreign to this server prior to your arrival. Although your actions fall under the guidelines of this server, they were utterly unknown and incomprehensible to those of us who wished to engage in diplomacy and statemanship. This is the fault of neither party, as these issues had never previously been faced. However, you must realize that, when faced with what was perceived as ""barbarity"", the players of CivCraft would react with disgust and anger.


**To the previously established CivCraft populace:**

Your knee-jerk reaction to the actions of a few players is what contributed to the massive offensive that ultimately led to your subjugation. By labelling all ""HCF players"" as evil, you essentially forced them all to band together. The indiscriminate assault and pearling of players perceived as part of the ""HCF side"" led to a consolidation of their group, allowing them to band together behind a common cause. What was originally ""Zanatom's group"", ""prerequisite's group"", and ""Gordge's group"" (yes, I don't know much about the specifics, but spare me the complaints), became the ""HCF menace"". Moreover, the continued villianization of these groups (due in part to my own words) united them moreso and spurred them to fulfill the server's view of them: a maurading force that ruined the CivCraft experience. Except that they did not ruin the CivCraft experience. Their actions are completely permissible, and even somewhat encouraged, under the current server rules. It took a massive chewing-out by Orthzar for me to realize this.


This was never more apparent to me than during a conversation with McFluffykins. McFluffykins attempted to negotiate peace for Mt. Augusta, ensuring the release of thecriminalmind as compensation. He held little sway over the majority of HCF players, but still attempted to allow some degree of peace for a town he enjoyed the company of. In return, he we spat in his face and labelled him a traitor. Any person would feel betrayed as a result, when they personally put their own neck on the line. Furthermore, McFluffykins said something truly revelatory to me: ""You've called us assholes, so we'll act like assholes."" The server's knee-jerk reactions, sweeping generalizations (yes, I realize the irony), and hostile approach to anyone remotely associated with the HCF led to what we have today. We have created a self-fulfilling prophecy in our subreddit with witch-hunts and community rants.


**To the ""incoming"" HCF players:**

You guys originally came to this server imagining a populace under the iron-fist of ""the ancaps"". However, this was never the case. The ""ancaps"" played a precarious game in which they pearled those they deemed dangerous while playing off diplomacy and aiding the the CivCraft populace with public acts. When you attempted to displace them, you threatened everyone on this server. It is only natural for those who feel threatened to unite in voice and react with revulsion. Furthermore, your acts of ""total war"", such as the mass lava-ing of Mt. Augusta and the indiscriminate pearling of anyone who ""opposes"" you, led to further ostracizing. Instead of attempting to clean up your act and take responsibility for your actions, you continued under the guise of ""establishing a new order"", a lie which most everyone saw through as an enactment of your own personal agenda.


When people suggest that you pearl the members of HCF who are acting like assholes, they're not asking you to become the next ""world police"". They want you to take responsibility for the original crusade you started and keep those that are perceived as your allies in line. Nobody expects you to keep watch over the entire server and pearl griefers. They just want you to maintain order in your ranks as a means of proving to the server that you want to participate. However, whether you want to do so is entirely up to you.


Overall, this is a server in which you can do whatever the fuck you want. Just realize that your actions have an impact on real human beings, regardless of how ""rediculous"" their reactions to said policies may be.

I've probably missed about 50% of what I actually wanted to say in this post, so expect some edits. Also, I used quotes excessively because a lot of these terms are non-specific.

Edit 1: I just realized I posted this as ""DEER CIVRAFT"" instead of ""DEER CIVCRAFT"". However, fuck reposts.

Edit 2: [Here's a picture of me making a stupid face.](http://i.imgur.com/ejMJc.jpg?1)

Edit 3: [Erich's contribution to the discussion.](http://imgur.com/a/V6fIZ)

Edit 4: First of all, the whole ""you called us assholes"" point was **not** any kind of justification for their actions. However, there were a great many HCF players who were not participating in the marauding who were lumped together prior to their joining in with the problematic HCF players. By lumping them all together, the server never gave the players *not killing and pearling* a chance to help; subsequently, because they felt marginalized, they decided to lash out.

HCF players, you're acting like massive assholes. Please stop. At this point you're just rubbing salt in the wounds. MrTwiggy,

&gt; Remember everyone, reality =/= video game. You'd be surprised how many CivCraft players have yet to learn this very important lesson.

This is not your lesson to teach. **DO NOT** conflate your actions to some sort of beneficiary role. You're being a dick because you want to be, nothing more, and you're causing others pain, regardless of whether or not they should feel said pain. Furthermore, people won't take this game any less seriously with you pearling them and their friends and then taunting them.

Stop getting pearled. If you don't recognize someone, or you know they're bad, log out. Please. It is only hindering the war efforts when more and more of us citizens are getting locked up for no reason. Their vault is quite large and it requires a lot of people and a lot of work to open it up, and we risk equipment and even more pearls to cracking the vault. If you want to help, that's great, but stop feeding them your pearls. Stop going into the cities where their presence is known, thinking they won't pearl you, or that you can sneak around. No, just log out, and wait 'till the coast is clear.

**Before entering a city** send a private message to almost anyone from the Batcave asking them if it's safe. We have a snitch network, we know where they are most of the time.

I have been on this server for only a few months and yet I can still see this being a thing. I can't hold it any longer. My friends from Unity have helped greatly

**Chapter One: Bitch Got Foofed**

   Another day of extreme wealth happened upon the AnCaps. As they looked onto their mountains of wealth they knew that today would be like any other day in the CivCraft world. Since unknown from the rest of the CivCraft Universe, the AnCaps finally decided to show me their daily routine, full of love and bukkake. This is a dramatically true retelling.  

Immelol4 awoke to a sweaty Dr_Oracle by his bedside. He knew that it was a rough night before, with all the healing potions lying about, and he was aware of the travesty that was now Oracle's butthole, lying air-up. He awoke, and the Doctor begged him to peg him before he went out. Immelol agreed as he shrugged his diamond armor off and laid Dr_Oracle down on the table, made of solid gold and tears. Immelol teased and pleased, piercing Oracle's spider eye with his blaze rod.

Now ready, Oracle looked Lol in the eyes and said in a seductive tone, ""Be careful, I'm only in proc 3...""

This drove Imme into a mad frenzy, screaming his ideologies and smashing Dr's Oracle. All throughout this dance of flesh, they had a prying eye they were unaware of. Tactful was gazing at them, stroking his Egodick. He got over his heated thoughts after catching the sight of Oracle's slime balls, and regained composure, standing up to alert the rest of the AnCaps that the day has begun. Tact left the candid scene, hearing Oracle yell, ""YES! YES! FOOF ALL OVER ME!""

Tactful ran to his sex slave Exultant, who was awake with morning birch wood. Tactful immediately forgot about his announcement as he saw Exultant's diamond drill coming out of the covers. He was already iron reinforced, and waddled to Exultant. As he stripped, he could hear Exultant moaning, ""AWH YAH MATE GIT IT IN DER. CRIKEY M8"". Exultant drew his ""shoiney"" stingray, plunging it into Tactful's ravine. He pulled out and the dangling cocoa beans were plentiful enough to make morning cookies later. Before the two could mine each other dry, they were uninterrupted by Orthzar. He was holding a block in his hands, amber in colo(u)r. Orethzar said eagerly, ""I have some extra ores left over from the map reset, do you have any, uh, plans?"" Orthzar gave a sly wink as he withdrew a dildo the size of both Exultant and Tactful's head, made of every ore that he took from Vanilla CivTest. He took another reddish butt-plug of equal size, made up of the nether ores he robbed from the game. He said, ""I hope you guys don't have netherwarts, because I'm going to pump you till you spout covalence dust.""

Tactful and Exultant were obviously confused, looking at each other and saying ""B...but EE is disabled!""

Orthzar spared but a glance before going rose red and muttering, ""Not when you have admin crimeees &lt;3.""

Before the HCF came, I truly loved this server. It was unlike any other server out there. There was a real sense of community, and although there was a tonne of drama, we were still all one community really. I used to wander the map, helping people wherever I went. I spent much time wandering the nether roads, exploring ruins and meeting and talking to new people. I would take a stack or two of melon slices and a stack of cobble (from my store room) and I was off, seeing new places and finding new things. It was some of the best fun I ever had in my life, just finding someone new and talking to them, finding out their story as I helped them in whatever endeavor they were doing. I met a great many wonderful people this way, people like thecriminalmind, Dr_Oracle, Marcus_Flaminius,  Sami_Ghani and many more. At that time I truly loved the server, it brought me joy and happiness when I got on and made me feel like I was a part of something bigger.

And then the HCF attacked.

Many of my friends left, many were pearled, and the things we had toiled over for so long were wiped off the map or covered in lava. Still, I kept on. I continued my helping work. When Augusta was burning and covered in lava, I was there cleaning it up. When some randoms I knew needed help all the way across the map, I ran through the nether and got there and helped them. This was my reality. When the mass pearlings were taking place, I decided to lay low. I went to an island base and did nothing for a few weeks. Then when the menace passed, I went back to my work.

While the server recovered, the sense of community never did. After those events nothing has been the same. The people who I played with and enjoyed the company of were all gone. The server, was devastated. And all of the work that we had done was wiped out.

I just can't cope anymore. I used to think I was safe, now I worry all day if my house, or my friends houses are still there. This isn't how it's supposed to be. This is supposed to be fun!

So I'm leaving.

I'll be gone for a while, I don't know how long. I'm sorry to all that I couldn't help. I'm sorry to all the new guys who sill never experience the true sense of civcraft. And I'm sorry most of all to my friends, because I have let you down.

Take care dear ones, and may you live long and prosper.

This particular ordeal has taught me an important lesson about off site backups and I am working with quite a few people to resolve this issue. All future backups from Achilles will not be stored locally, instead they will be uploaded to remote backup servers with different hosts that will remain appropriately anonymous. Ideally the script will backup every 2-12 hours and alternate locations for every backup, rotating through all the storage locations every day or so. 

While it may be impossible to really lose all the backups with this method it does present other problems, mainly that trust severely limits the destinations. But I am confident we can find enough trusted locations to make the system effective. 


Onto server performance, I find the current performance of the temp server to be very encouraging as an estimation for performance on the production server, I think that if I take the right measures to limit resource usage on the server we may almost be able to let the inevitable flood of people when we come back online all online. 

This of course brings up a question, with Dyncap I can change the player cap on the fly based on tick, what should be my lower limited? Should I stop letting people in when the tick just beings to go below 20? Only when it starts dipping below 10? My usual metric is that if the tick goes below 10 I need to cap it. 

Finally, thank you all so much for your support as of yesterday we raised about $150 for hosting. With our costs for this VM currently at about $13 a day that covers about 11 days.

1361755486.0,40,self.Civcraft,195x9h,Murray Rothbard on freedom of speech (relevant to the current drama),43,3,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/195x9h/murray_rothbard_on_freedom_of_speech_relevant_to/,"Not my personal view, but several Ancaps have supported Server contrary to the model outlined here. I know Rothbard's example differs from the real situation in that shouting obscenities is not necessarily damaging in and of itself, but I think the broader concept is present. If free speech is not removed from property rights, the Valentians have the right to control speech in land they've rightfully homesteaded.

&gt;The basic flaw in the liberal separation of “human rights”
and “property rights” is that people are treated as ethereal
abstractions. If a man has the right to self-ownership, to the
control of his life, then in the real world he must also have the
right to sustain his life by grappling with and transforming
resources; he must be able to own the ground and the
resources on which he stands and which he must use. In short,
to sustain his “human right”—or his property rights in his
own person—he must also have the property right in the
material world, in the objects which he produces. Property
rights are human rights, and are essential to the human rights
which liberals attempt to maintain. The human right of a free
press depends upon the human right of private property in
newsprint.     

&gt;In fact, there are no human rights that are separable from
property rights. The human right of free speech is simply the
property right to hire an assembly hall from the owners, or to
own one oneself; the human right of a free press is the property right to buy materials and then print leaflets or books and
to sell them to those who are willing to buy. There is no extra
“right of free speech” or free press beyond the property rights
we can enumerate in any given case. And furthermore, discovering and identifying the property rights involved will
resolve any apparent conflicts of rights that may crop up.
Consider, for example, the classic example where liberals
generally concede that a person’s “right of freedom of speech”
must be curbed in the name of the “public interest”: Justice
Holmes’ famous dictum that no one has the right to cry “fire”
falsely in a crowded theater. Holmes and his followers have
used this illustration again and again to prove the supposed
necessity for all rights to be relative and tentative rather than
precise and absolute.       

&gt;But the problem here is not that rights cannot be pushed
too far but that the whole case is discussed in terms of a vague
and wooly “freedom of speech” rather than in terms of the
rights of private property. Suppose we analyze the problem
under the aspect of property rights. The fellow who brings on
a riot by falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded theater is, necessarily, either the owner of the theater (or the owner’s agent) or
a paying patron. If he is the owner, then he has committed
fraud on his customers. He has taken their money in exchange
for a promise to put on a movie or play, and now, instead, he
disrupts the show by falsely shouting “fire” and breaking up
the performance. He has thus welshed on his contractual obligation, and has thereby stolen the property—the money—of
his patrons and has violated their property rights.      

&gt;Suppose, on the other hand, that the shouter is a patron
and not the owner. In that case, he is violating the property
right of the owner—as well as of the other guests to their paid for performance. As a guest, he has gained access to the property on certain terms, including an obligation not to violate the
owner’s property or to disrupt the performance the owner is
putting on. His malicious act, therefore, violates the property
rights of the theater owner and of all the other patrons.
There is no need, therefore, for individual rights to be
restricted in the case of the false shouter of “fire.” The rights
of the individual are still absolute; but they are property rights.
The fellow who maliciously cried “fire” in a crowded theater
is indeed a criminal, but not because his so-called “right of free
speech” must be pragmatically restricted on behalf of the
“public good”; he is a criminal because he has clearly and
obviously violated the property rights of another person.

You will die, your items will be incinerated, so the HCF has no possible way of benefiting from them. They cannot pearl you, so they will not have you as a hostage bargaining token. You can live without fear that the product of your toil will be used to support tyranny.

If we all agree to this simple thing, we **will** make a difference. Pledge to follow the Lava Bucket Oath. Do your part to atrophy the HCF's war effort. Be a hero to your fellow man.

1368151832.0,38,self.Civcraft,1e1kxo,[Proposal] A simple idea to help new players,45,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1e1kxo/proposal_a_simple_idea_to_help_new_players/,"I've mentioned this before in the comments of a [few](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1dq8wr/morning_change_log_for_2013055/c9ssbgt) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1dp2h5/spawning_and_how_to_make_it_better_and_things/c9sgrsm) but I feel like it warrants it's own self-post.


**The Idea**


Players spawn with a written book in their inventory that contains a very short and dumbed down guide to civcraft. This guide will include *brief* run-downs of the server's mods (and links to more information), coords to cities (or link to a map of cities willing to have their city attract new players), and a *brief* rundown of the server's purpose so people don't confuse it for another anarchy/factions/architecture server. 


**Why?**


There is a myriad of pros to this. 

1. Makes it easier for new players to learn - a lone book being the only thing in your inventory draws more attention than a sentence in a sidebar of some reddit somewhere. It also will only give information necessary for them to understand civcraft (saving them from reading mass guides).

2. Clears up misconceptions for new players -  When I first joined this server, I came from the miner apocalypse server. I liked the ideas of civilizations in that server but it was too small and too easy to grief, that's when I heard about civcraft and decided to check it out. As luck would have it, I spawned directly in the middle of nine (late december, so it was pretty developed). The large structures were so impressive I shrugged civcraft off as being too easy mode and decided it wasn't for me. First impressions make a world of difference and the guide can make sure those impressions are accurate.

3. Gives other players less to explain - I've helped my share of newbies, and a lot of them didn't know about the reddit, didn't bother to read it, or didn't understand it. Having a guide like this makes it easier for others to explain, and gives us more time to go into detail about things that can't be put into a guide - history, purpose, community, economics, etc. instead of teaching them how to use citadel.


**Criticisms of this**


&gt; If these hooligans can't even read a sidebar I don't want them here at all!


This is an awfully judgmental attitude. Civcraft's largest active population of a city was 17 people in strongman's population poll, and more people just increase the depth of the experiment - we should be striving to increase player retention. It's easy to misread or be daunted by the large amount of text required to understand civcraft, and a lot of gamers instinctively don't read much because they learn better by jumping right into the experience. The easier we make it for them, the more players we get.


I'll edit in more criticisms as they are brought up and addressed. 


**UPDATE**


A majority of people agree with having a mechanic guide, but don't want information about cities in there - I don't agree but it seems the idea won't move forward with city information, so I will draft a guide with just the mechanics. Thank you, everyone, for your feedback and attention.

In a few hours they will all be awake and the issue of if we are to be allowed to continue hosting at Dreamhost will be brought up. While I would like to be optimistic I do not think it likely that we will be welcome even if the same situation in the future would be less severe.

The evidence submitted was a [video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39_QLTO3K20&amp;feature=youtu.be) showing him standing still in the end, with sprint particles exuding from his feet. The particular hack he is accused of using is one that is an absolute toggle sprint – the sprint remains on at all times, even while standing still or flying. Iusethisforgood [posted in the thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18lm9e/official_evidence_and_accusations_against/c8g3xzt) admitting use of the mod “Better Sprinting.” Thus, the question at hand is whether Better Sprinting and other absolute toggles for sprinting are prohibited under the rules.

For a thorough explanation of sprint modifications, the [post by kk-](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/18lm9e/official_evidence_and_accusations_against/c8g7swn) in the accusation thread provides an excellent resource. As he notes, sprint not only provides faster movement, but knockback/knockback damage when one hits another player in PVP. There is no question that an absolute sprint toggle such as the one used by Iusethisforgood provides significant advantages not possible to simulate without use of the modification, such as knockback while standing still, while moving through obstacles, and while changing direction. As such, absolute sprint toggles are a violation of cheating policy and are actionable.
	
As for “sprint buttons” that merely simulate a double-tap, I see no reason why those would violate the cheating policy, as they merely map a very simple action to a key. Use them if you like. I never remember to.

Should this violation result in a ban for Iusethisforgood? This was the subject of significant discussion among the administrators. One can see how someone inexperienced in PVP might not have understood why it would constitute a violation of the cheating policy. Precedent and policy, however, leave no room for sympathy. Justice is blind, and Iusethisforgood violated the rules. Regretfully, there is no room for discretion in this matter.

**The crime is sprint-hacking. The sentence is ban.**

My goal here is to rectify that. Before we can rectify the issue, we need to identify the problem.

The KFC is a somewhat cohesive, somewhat organized group of skilled (as much as Minecraft allows it) PvP'ers who are admittedly bent on fucking our day up (Because being an asshole online is edgy and stuff). They have access to 100+ alts, they likely use hacks in some capacity, but will vehemently deny it (Review some more hacked clients for me on your YouTube channel, mcfluffykins), and we're almost certain they VPN/proxy (These guys are willing to push every boundary they can in order to achieve their ends, it sort of is implied that they will also cheat to do so). They can log on in a large mass whenever something vital is going on, but generally only a handful will log on regularly.


**So, what does this mean for us?**


* Because of the nature of the simulation, and real life conflicts, we can't predict when they'll attack, and we're somewhat hampered in our ability to respond to such attacks. 

* We can never truly know how many of them there are at any point in time, so judging their numbers by the player list is a bad strategy.

* We have superior numbers, but inferior skill (on the average) and inferior coordination.

**So, what do we do about this?**


We need more coordination, but more importantly, we all need to get our skillz up. We *all* need to be on a comparable level of PvP ability. Once we are all equally or similarly capable at PvP, all that we need is some coordination. We can have a distributed army united by a single goal who would be able to respond to any major conflict on a moment's notice. It would be the KFC's worse nightmare. They wouldn't be able to look at the player list and know whether or not it was a good idea to attack/defend. We could potentially completely shut the KFC down without even fighting them. Pearling them would be fucking trivial. Cracking their vaults would be a joke. 

This plan also has the added benefit of people being able to defend themselves in the future KFC-less world, lessening the reliance of the entire server on bounty/griefer hunters. Basically, what I'm proposing is, creating a defensive environment similar to Switzerland. Everyone in the country/Civcraftia has the tools and the training necessary to help defend the entire system, when needed. 


**Some things I'd like to pre-emptively address before I continue.**


* Yes, I realize not everyone has a good computer and is able to engage in combat. That's fine. Not everyone in a war fires a gun.

* No, this shit will not be a United Nations stand-in. Fuck that noise. This is people coming together to help each other, for mutual gain. This will not be a political army, it will be an army that helps fight existential threats like the KFC, and then goes back to their cities and towns afterwards, and continues on with their 'lives'.

* Yes, all the organization and planning will be done publicly. There will be no need for us to remain secretive (other than people their identities to be concealed, which we can facilitate). There will be no bases and no secrets. The only people who should be paranoid are those that have committed crimes against us, and are due for retribution. This will have the added effect of instilling paranoia in the fascists.

**So how do I propose we rectify the current problems?**

* I will organize a team of people currently in the resistance to run a boot camp, of sorts. I will try my hardest to get as many people as possible (Send me a PM on reddit, or an email to civcraftblueavenue@gmail.com) interested in joining the Distributed Interpersonal Civcraftian Kombatants.

* I will organize an informational network that will allow rapid response. I currently have setup a Civcraft IRC (#civcraft on gamesurge.net) channel, and I plan on expanding that to Google's social media tools (Gmail, Google Hangouts, etc.) and of course we already have the subreddit and Mumble. Unfortunately, a subreddit isn't an ideal way to send and receive information, and not enough people use Mumble. I propose everyone create a Civcraft-specific Gmail (civcraft&lt;in-game name&gt;@gmail.com) account, and create desktop notifications, that way information can be relayed to everyone, whether they're online or not.

* A team of commanders will be trained to lead any troops in combat. Combat seems simplistic, but people have a tendency to want to break off and do their own thing.

I really want the HCF gone, but I'm glad they came.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/15ozhn/you_know_what_i_really_want_the_hcf_gone_but_im/)

I'm glad they came as well, but I don't think my reason is the same as yours.

&gt;It just shows what can happen when a destructive state gets too powerful.

I don't think this is a good comparison, and I don't think what occured makes for a good demonstration of this experiment. All I saw here was an upfront display of every single flaw with Civcraft's method.

These guys came here and outmatched every single established faction of a nine month old server in the space of a few weeks. They didn't rise like some overly charismatic dictator, a gradually overreaching government or an organised militaristic empire; they came and used the broken/worthless game mechanics of Minecraft to destroy so many hard won achievements with little comparative groundwork. All the time, planning and effort was shown to be in fact worth fuck all against a bunch of lunatics from a different server, because the game of Civcraft just doesn't do the job we all hoped it did.

* **The nether being a 1:8 ratio to the real world meant that all difficulty and logistics of travel between locations simply isn't a factor.** The HCF is able to be anywhere in a very short period of time for little to no cost, turning the whole server into a never ending battle. At any time new aggressors can arrive on the scene. The solution to this in our present situation requires complex manipulation of Nether Portal connection mechanics along with massive material cost of producing secure-able general access portals for ""peace time"" use by travellers. **Massive** upfront costs to simply *[disable]* access to an area is prohibitive to the development of communities without access to pre-enlarged coffers.

* Ttk2 has already proposed a possible solution to it, but it should be reiterated. **The enchanting system, in combination with the pathetically simplistic weapon/armour mechanics and tech-tree fucked over all potential resisting agents.** In no time at all HCF were able to match the most powerful groups in all factors but for their snitch networks. The war was [lost] because there was **no** way for this to prepared for in any way that didn't require engineering the entire server's factions and infrastructure around providing effective resistance to such an event. Doing that is barely possible with the diverse factions on Civcraft, and potentially goes against a large point of the simulation. A global defense force isn't something that should *have* to be in every player's interest.

* Other than aesthetics and continual exposure to other players via chat range, **there is no benefit to living/being in a city**. Perhaps the addition of beacons is a solution if they are re-engineered for effective compatibility with citadel groups, but as it stands there is simply not enough of a standing population in a city with the present number of live players who can be expected to be within a single location. This is further compounded by the ease of travel provided by The Nether's vast difference in size. Whether I live in Rothbard, Augusta or Fort PJ doesn't matter when it is still only going to take me a minute or two to reach any other trading area. Being in Communa, Haven or Nine doesn't seem to do anything at all to keep me safer from attack by griefers, and the failure of the The World Police has demonstrated that even combined efforts of players here don't do anything to ensure safety. Columbia, one of the most impressive virtual collaborative efforts I have ever seen, stands as a collection of mostly abandoned ruins that each voice a subtle reminder of all these locations being built for no reason at all.

---

Lets start with the ultimate question, ""What is Civcraft supposed to be?"" 

If we are to listen to the sidebar it is an experiment for and about communities, how groups of people interact with each other and live together. It doesn't take more than a quick glance at the world to identify the key puzzle piece that allows huge numbers of free actors, each capable of harming others irreparably, to organize and live together in relative harmony. 

The key is consequences, a system for holding people responsible for their actions is a primary component of a society and where that is not possible, where people can not be held responsible and remain free actors there is chaos. 

The crowning achievement of Civcraft can be summed up in one word, consequences, we have managed to make it possible to restrain players and impose on them consequences for their actions. Everything about Civcraft flows from that one point and is geared towards that one goal. 

PrisonPearl is our system, but with it was revealed a flaw, it was possible for an individual to switch accounts, escape all consequences for their actions, and continue to create chaos. We had players cycling through 8 or more accounts, be they stolen or borrowed, never using one for longer than it took to create disorder. For Civcraft to the successful in any capacity we had to stop this cold, it was with that in mind that Exultant created a pearl script to identify and ban alts and integrated it into PrisonPearl. 

I would really love to talk more about the details of its operation, its a work of incredible technical competency and a little bit of kludgey genius that deserves to be admired. But I can not do so, the details of its operation are kept secret with the goal of preventing individuals from circumventing it.

Of course while a work of significant skill the script is by no means sentient and relies entirely on human intervention to provide exclusionary data, its the human oversight that makes this system effective in preventing players from escaping consequences. 

RattlerTank was attempting to walk the finest line possible, to cause as much chaos as possible while escaping the consequences of his actions each and every time. When framed in this context it should surprise no one that he then encountered problems in every location where the exact position of the cliff edge he was walking was not enumerated in excruciating detail. 

If it where not this location, or the one before it, it would merely be another, for every situation the onus should be placed on us to ensure that he was fully informed as to every detail of that line, in an ideal world this would be reasonable. In an ideal world every player would read every single document we ever write before so much as touching their Minecraft client. In this ideal would we would also be able to write a perfect document suffering from no ambiguity. 

But we do not live in that world, we told Rattler that he should not be associated with any alts of Pikaoku. We meant *should* in the sense that if it happened it would be a problem to be fixed. He misinterpreted us, its unfortunate, but a reality of the English language. Some would argue that we should reverse the consequences of this misinterpretation or have spelled it out in excruciating detail, but what is a proper level of detail and what is a proper threshold of understanding? Should we unpearl every player confused as to the nature of the server? Anyone who claims to have misinterpreted what we say? We would have to if we where to be fair. In administration you must think of the consequences of your actions on the past and the future as well as the situation and the fact remains there is no way out we can provide Rattler that is fair to everyone else. If it where not for this consideration I would be at the very least ambivalent about reversing this if not supportive of it, but I *must* take into account the consequences of this action on both past and future cases. I do not have the luxury of doing what seems most fair in this situation if I wish not to be terribly unfair to literally hundreds of other players who have not the luxury of such public support.

Civcraft is a massive undertaking of programming, documentation on the scale needed to truly fix this problem would be an incredible task for a group of paid experts. For a hodgepodge bunch of volunteers its pretty much impossible. This does not mean we do not try, or ignore good suggestions, no matter how insultingly they where presented. But the fact remains we are human volunteers, when Rattler attempted to report his issues to me in mumble my response was ""Send it to modmail or I do not care"" because no human can keep track of even a quarter of the players on this server every day, much less all of their problems in their number and detail, we ask for this simple consideration for our humanity and the isolation of what we need to keep track of for our sanity. 

In the end I have one final point, the pearling of any criminal playing as Rattler did is inevitable, if the attempts of an entire server fail to impose consequences on a single individual or minority group of individuals then it is evidence that something is broken and we need to re-balance combat or some other mechanic until they face their consequences. This does not mean Civcraft opposes criminals, it means we require a higher class of criminal than any so far have achieved. Civcraft is about society, not PVP, about those people who associate with you and how they do so, not the way you fight.

----

* We have a new map generator from cliff, this one is focused on doing large biomes and doing it right, this means I will be pregenerating a 10k square on Civtest for everyone to explore and be spawned in. Please leave your comments, resources and spawners are made scarce but veins have not yet been added in so think about those and how they should be added in to improve the map. 

* There have been some issues tagging biomes properly in the maps with terrian control, anyone that could help out or look into why the biome tagging feature of terrian control seems to be glitching out would be more than welcome, without it realistic biomes really does not stand too much of a chance of every working and we will continue to have issues with mobs spawning in the wrong spots. 

* I was provided with a brand new FactoryMod.jar configured to the new specifications, it does not change vanilla crafting bug provides a series of recepies for producing items and enchanted items at significantly lower costs than default. Furthermore it disables or at least nerfs acquiring xp from mobs, instead targeting farming as the reliable source of XP to be well.. farmed. Experiences with these changes should be commented on. 

* The test.civcraft.vg domain should point directly at the test server now, regardless of the fact that it is actually running on mc.civcraft.vg on a different port. 

* CombatTag has a new version online that should be working correctly, please report if you can tag and pearl tagged npc's properly. 

* I am now trying the pearl feed delay system, if the player does not log on that day you should not be charged the 1 coal. 

* Riotmod: Although I would like to try it I am afraid it simply does too much damage to armor, especially when armor is so expensive now, but I am no expert on that, I would like some input on the additional weapons riot-mod offers and how they would affect the game. 

* MineLibrary, essentially a chest system for bookshelves this mod allows books to be stored in bookshelves, I would also like to move the book duplication code from morecraftableblocks to this mod if we decide to use it, I am currently unopposed and waiting on a .jar.

* There do seem to be serious issues with trying to generate the nether and nether resources in the overworld, with that in mind we are trying to find ways we can solve the problem. If there exists an easy way to scale the nether to 1:1 through changing portal placement links (which looks like it might actually be doable) that would be great, but I would have to avoid pregenerating it to save on disk space. 


* JukeAlert has been seeing significant progress and development over the past couple of days , while I can not provide an ETA for a build I am confident that we will get one out pretty quickly. 

* Good work everyone, lets keep things moving.

Changes for Civcraft:

* Ok, I am thinking about interesting changes to Civcraft over the next few days, how about upping the pearling cost to 64 coal? Or maybe the storm probability to 100%

1365816476.0,39,self.Civcraft,1c8uak,Codification of subreddit rules and guidelines.,64,25,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1c8uak/codification_of_subreddit_rules_and_guidelines/,"With the recent posts complaining about a decline in overall subreddit quality, and the recent release of civchan, the subreddit administration has decided to create some new rules &amp; guidlines. To help us create new rules we have added /u/ariehkovler and re-added /u/Erich_.

After much debate and discussion we have reached a consensus on rules, and they are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. **Directly or reasonably tangentially Civcraft related** 

&gt; Thus, image macros/memes and copypasta will be removed. This works in conjunction with clauses 2 and 3.

## 2. **No links to civchan.** 

&gt; You may put them in a self post, only if you are discussing the thread seriously, e.g. a post on      civchan is like a leak from /r/LibSocMC. This works in conjunction with clauses 1 and 3, i.e. a lot of civchan posts break rules 1, 3, and 9.

## 3. Posts that are spam, i.e. posts containing no content, will be marked as spam.

&gt; This works in conjunction with clauses 1 and 2.

## 4. GUIDELINE: Accusation threads **should** be self posts.

&gt; Because it doesn’t take that much more effort to include the link to the snitch logs in the body of a self post, and it would also make it more likely that more information will be provided in the OP, not down in the comments somewhere.

## 5. GUIDELINE: Earn your bullshit.

&gt; Basically, people who usually contributed good stuff would be treated a little less harshly for the occasional weird and wacky post, but people who only or mainly post shit get treated more harshly. For example this account /u/ThankGodForHCF is a good example of NOT earning your bullshit. [End goal for the curious...](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/constructive.png)

## 6. Comments will moderated more lightly than posts, but there will still be a baseline quality expected.

&gt; Thus spamming will be regulated in both comments and posts. This works in conjunction with clause 5.

## 7. GUIDELINE: Image posts are good in some cases, e.g. city showcases and pictures of events on the server, crossposts from other Civcraft subs will also be tolerated.

&gt; The case will differ each time.

## 8. A moderator bot will be instated for spammers, etc. This will be used in conjunction to  CivVerify providing [checkmarks](http://www.redditstatic.com/green-check.png) to users who are verified.

&gt; This will provide users and moderators with a quick way to dig through throwaways and alt accounts. Accounts whose sole existence is to spam the subreddit and shitpost. **We will not ban all non verified accounts, being that we have lurkers who just watch the drama, etc.**

## 9. All sorts of harassment outside of the game is from here on punished by bans.

&gt; This includes but is not limited to: racial slurs, and threats.

## 10. [GUIDELINE: Follow some Reddiquette!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLpktf2jYw)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your post is removed we recommend moving it to civchan, or a different subreddit. 

We also recommend groups producing their own group specific subreddits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL:DR**

Don’t rage when your shitposts are removed and your throwaway account is banned.

----------------------------------

**Tigerstaden:**

1. You entered Tigerstaden and had a party, thats ok.

2. You started placing blocks around and spamming their chat range, thats still fun, you could just clean it up, no harm no foul.

3. The proper authorities in Tigerstaden [asked you to leave] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1by70l/nobody_will_help_monkeywithanaxe_pearled_in/), but you didn't, this is getting into tresspassing and griefing now, still not a huge deal though, it's still all in fun.

4. [Members of their town and even a parliament member were pearled] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1by9kl/this_is_your_world_police_griefing_tigerstaden/), that's not ok. You can't attack a sovereign nation as a game then play it off like it's just for fun after such a large scale international incident.

5. [War has been declared] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1byfx3/tigerstaden_officially_declares_war/)

These are pretty blatant acts of war directed against a city that did not provoke you, they have gone so far as to [declare a national state of emergency] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Tigerstaden/comments/1byfmb/tigerstaden_under_attack_do_not_log_in_this_is/), this isn't fun anymore.

*I know the party and the attacks weren't the same people** that's how it looked at the time, I appreciate that people involved contacted me about this so I could edit the post, sorry for the misunderstanding but information is hard to get sometimes when it's all jumbled up like during a possible crisis.

---------------------

As for Immelol, Overdragon and Facriop, it sounds like they are the ones doing the pearling. Anyone can see that these are offences that would normally get someone thrown in the End for A LONG TIME. Now, I haven't seen any evidence of this so I will not condemn them, but if this is true... the other members of the party need to step up and fix what their companions are doing.

Edit: Immelol and Facirop are wanted by the Arx Republicus, bounties coming later.

------------------------

The response of the Arx Republicus:

1. Immelol's rights to citizenship in the Arx Republicus have been temporarily been made void.

2. In response to our allies from [Fellowship] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1byfmp/fellowship_response_to_tigerstadens_attack/) AND [New Agora] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1bygii/new_agora_unofficial_statement_to_any_tigerstaden/), we have decided to also allow safe haven to citizens of Tigerstaden, a city we consider an unofficial ally.

3. Arxian Troops have been put on active standby with advance troops already having been deployed. We will remain neutral but will pearl on sight ANYONE who is seen griefing or killing in Tigerstaden. If you have a problem with this statement, please ask yourself why you think out dedication to pearling killers and griefers is bad, it dosent matter who they are, its against the law.

Since the infamous Bloody Christmas, large scale conflicts have watered down to a small number of isolated clashes. Comrades have begun to rejoice this new found peace by traversing the once warlord infected nether highways. Reformed members of the HCF have begun to settle down and the sword has been replaced with the ballot box once more for other states. However, despite the rising peace among the workers of Civcraft, there are unverified accounts of retaliatory pearlings by Ancap World Police terrorists. However, such militant behavior remains relevant for a small fringe who seek destruction over prosperity.




Hudson Bay has made a surprising step towards a political and economic union with Buenos Aires! After a group of raiders devastated the city, Comrade Governor Bmchapman formally resigned and handed over control to our Glorious Premier. Only a day after the peaceful annexation, Buenos Aire forces captured a number of these petty raiders in a swift operation. Upon further enhanced interrogation, the illiterate raiders admitted to being paid by Ancap terrorists to cause damage to the peaceful port city. 



The Democratic Workers Republic of Buenos Aires is now officially a Workers Republic! After three days of voting for three parties: Juche, Socialist, and People's Party. The ballots are in and the results counted! The Comrades of the Juche party took 3 seats while the Socialist obtained the other two seats of the five available seats in the Workers Parliament. As the new parties organize, our Glorious Premier has changed his attire slightly as part of his new TV series, Alo Glorious Premier. In the new program, our red beret wearing Glorious Premier spends hours on end talking in front of a camera! In a recent announcement, the Glorious Premier proclaimed, ""With this new red beret and this amazing new technology called a TV, we can surely bring Leninism into the 21st century!"".

You might know me from such educational films as ""Murray Rothbard: The Man That Took Too Many Naps"", or ""Erich\_Honecker_: The Man, The Myth, The Grumper"". Today I'm here to talk to you about a very important subject: Hardcore Factions.

As much as you may have seen me argue against HCF's actions over the past few weeks on the subreddit, one cannot argue that HCF have not drastically changed the server dynamic. They've added something that hasn't been present in the past: true authoritarianism and slavery. Real life had slavers, so too should Civcraft.

However, HCF deviates from the experiment because of the limitations of Minecraft. Notch, Jeb_, and Dinnerbone, have made a game designed to be played efficiently in SSP, therefore nothing requires effort to do. As such, they were able to quickly amass power equal to that of the so-called ""World Police"".

As such, I think what HCF have brought to the server is very interesting, although ultimately something destructive to community on the server.

Ultimately, and this is addressed to HCF, you'd have become much more powerful had you been able to agree with many established Civcrafters to have a shared position of power. At the moment, you hold absolute power...of a wasteland.

I have seen too many people put work into building small villages and cities only to see them become abandoned when they only receive a trickle of new users who leave soon after, leaving the city builders discouraged. 

If you build your own city, a few things will happen. One, you'll be competing with every other city for residents. You'll have to either attract new people to join your city instead of one of the established ones or else seduce established users to leave their city where they have friends and attachments, not an easy task.

You also may have to form a government or management structure of some sort, which is cool if that's what you want to do, but a pain if it's just incidental. This isn't always necessary of course.

I've found it much easier and more satisfying to simply go where the people are, even though it means i put some of my own projects on the backburner. If you are freindly you will often find a lot of help in building whatever it is you'd like much more quickly than if you did it alone. Additionally, there is a wealth of experience to be gained from the rise and fall of old cities, which you could learn from without the pain of your own failures if you joined such a city to begin with.

Consider forming a private or public society, or a political party or voting bloc if you're in a democratic city, and really put your energies into that once thing.

Another thing to note is that some less planned cities have a bit of a sprawl problem which you can use to your advantage. It is possible, though i have never seen it happen before, to insert yourself into an existing city while claiming your own uniqueness from it by simply founding a sovereign district or city-state neighboring an existing city. So long as you state your boundaries unambiguously(via a wall or some such) a sprawling city will simply expand around you over time. In the meantime you can fight it out through treaties and diplomatic arrangements and other drama-causing delights.

Another advantage to this as far as the server at large is concerned is that the more populous and socially complicated a city becomes, the more it requires it's residents and managers to come up with clever social and political solutions, enriching the server. In my mind one populous city with many cool societies working diligently on what's important to them in particular is better than many small towns all scraping a living together.

Anyway these are just some thoughts. It looks like we've had a lot of new faces lately and i've been encouraged by some cool newcomers with their own ideas.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_14co64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/14co64/build_societies_not_cities/,

This event will be a shining example of Civcraft fun, competition, and Rivalry so attend as you may and crown yourself as Civcraft Olympians. Please read all of this thread to learn how to participate and post in the comments if you wish to Participate in the Games, all are welcome to spectate. There will be certain events, rules, and regulations you must follow so please read and understand each event you will participate in. So compete now and see if you town is the Best town on Civcraft...

Events ( In order):
No item events, August 24th 9PM,ET

Parkour- Whoever can complete the course the fastest.

Diving- That game dropper, this is it but at certain distances and nothing lethal. 50m 75m 100m

Hurdles- A straight run with single blocks or double blocks/pits to run over. 25m 50m 75m


Redstone speed build- Whoever can build the best redstone invention with the items in hand (Randomized every round)

Spleef- Last man Standing Wins, No PvP

Sailing- Fastest sailor wins, no leaving the boat and if yours breaks just plop down a new one (max of 3 boats in inventory)


Archery- With a 3x3 cobble box and a wood button in the middle and painting on the 4 corners if you hit the button that's 5 points, a painting is 2 points, and the cobble background is 1 point. Anything else is 0 points. 10m 25m 50m

How it works: To participate in these games each athlete from a town needs to pay 1 diamond, gold, and iron for entry. With the total amount of competitors in the games now made there will be competing groups of 5 people. 1st place gets a Diamond, 2nd gets Gold, and 3rd gets Iron. Whoever gets 1st place goes to the next round and faces the other people that also won diamond in other rounds. If you win this you get another diamond and crowed the best at this event. Also in the event of a lag spike the round will change to a best 2 out of 3 event for the competitors. On a similar note in the event of a tie the competitors who tied will share the highest title or (if in this case in combat) fight it out again.


Final tally: A diamond is worth 3 points, Gold is worth 2 points, and Iron is worth 1 point. The city with the most points at the end of ALL the games is crowed the Olympic champions of CivCraft and are gifted a large sum of goods from donators, Orion, and Dumathoin along with an Official signed book recognizing that they won the First ever Civcraft Olympic Games.


To compete: To compete you must belong to a town/city You must pay the entry fee, and cannot have more than 2 people from the same city/town in the same event  If you are caught cheating your Whole group will be disqualified from the games and all rewards must be returned.


Prizes: If you win the event you get the prize of it for example i won Diamond in parkour i get to keep that diamond. And later i get a book of all my total statistics saying that i officially won diamond in Archery, gold in diving etc.

When is this?: The ETA For this event will be August 24th 4PM and August 25th 6PM. August 24th will be the Events day so all the events will be hosted that day and the scores will be tallied. The next day will be the Awards ceremonies where the Athletes are given their awards and honored.


If you are going to compete: Post in the commends with the names of the people that are coming and what events they will participate in. I will clarify you results in a reply to your comments and if also make sure to msg me in Minecraft so i can add you to the full list.

Housing with a free Apartment room for your Town will be provided but no more for anybody else (unless you have a coach).


Spectators: Everybody is welcome to spectate and come watch the games. We encourage that you bring money and also trade with Orion to collect goods. We also recommend that you rent out an apartment room. And as for safety Orion will provide a VERY HEAVY Security that will protect the spectators and the Olympians. Also betting is encouraged.


Remember: This is a time for Fun among players and not to be fighting. Absolutely no City tension must occur in Orion all will be settled in the games and if you PVP with another town/city Without a pass from Matchbox124 or in Self defense your town/city will be disqualified and you will be asked to leave or be deported by force..

I, bananafone31, am the Architect of Dragons, and help run our kingdom along with the aid of a dozen others. We are a peaceful and benevolent faction, keen on defense, diplomacy, trade, and building the most beautiful city on the server.

Our capital of Blackcrown is located on the crest of a mountain, its steep cliffs providing a dramatic background to our stone cut keep. Surrounding the keep lies the Red Quarter, where merchants and citizens live and work. The Red Quarter gained its name from the dark red steep roofs atop every building in the district. Each house is similarly named, either in honor of its resident or because of its location.

Appointed architects are the sole builders of the surface city, building large monuments, cathedrals, and each individual house. The undercity, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. Each resident also owns the land underneath their house's foundations, free to do with as they please.

Other perks include public cauldrons and bakeries, auto-farms, access to the higher end factories for residents, free lodging for visitors, large markets, international rail lines, and beautiful scenery.

We're looking for more Game of Thrones fans who'd love to role play, build a beautiful city, and expand its lore. If you're a good architect, that's a definite bonus.

Here's some photos of Blackcrown and concept art:

* [The Dragon at the point of the Mountain](http://imgur.com/NgSaua9). Blackcrown's location was chosen because the natural rock formation resembled a dragon holding up the mountain with its wings

* [Blackcrown's Sigil](http://imgur.com/eq6LiFn): Ouroboros, which represents the cyclical nature of history. The sigil sits before the steps of the Keep.

Lucifelle, you deleted your comments, and submissions, but the one thing I remember you said that tweaked me is when I made the comment that you need a good dick, that means I endorse the raping of you.

Its that, that over exaggeration  is the reason I dont really like you.

No, me being a asshole to you does not mean I dislike you cause you arent a submissive quiet woman who isnt in the kitchen.

It means I dislike you because Ive had negative interactions with you in the past, Ive read many comments of yours through my time on here, and came to the conclusion that your not someone I would enjoy spending my time with.

But let me be straight here, I can be an asshole, so can all of you reading this.

I hopped into that channel because I was drunk, and I made a fool out of myself, but in the famously posted meme that started servererror down his road of petulance, [I regret nothing.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/342/129969639840.gif)

And while were at it, just to adress this little bit right quick, porkchop.

None of you people that I can recall that were in that channel knew pork not one bit.
 
He never goes on mumble, hardly ever plays civcraft, never plays civ 2, and yet you supposedly want to talk to him like you know him, like your best buds with him.

The only people that remotely know pork are people who played in Augusta, and even then most of them dont play anymore.

The first goddamn thing that was said when it was realized the second voice was pork was man I thought that was a girl.

Go get fucked, seriously.

To the people that are disappointed in me?

Really?

How many of you really know anything of me?

hey I said the word nigger, so I am racist right?

I dont mean the casual, oh you said hateful word x, so your a racist.

If thats what you want to go with fine, call me a racist, dont even care.

But if you want to get at that I have some deep hatred for people based on their color, fuck it gg get rekt I guess.

I guess this would be where I boast I have friends of different races, and work with these people as equals and blah blah blah.

But let us not forget one crucial thing, tis the internet, so um, something something meme, get rekt.

But one last thing while were on racism.

Obviously the word nigger triggers something in most of us fairly quickly, regardless of what we think of the word, or how its used, or who is using it.

But what about that subtle shit?

Wigger?

What is that again, a white nigger? cause why, of what they wear? what they listen too?

That isnt some racist shit?

Dont get me wrong though, Im not offended, especially from someone Ive never met, and never will.

Maybe this is what I really need to stop me from coming back here, to finally ruin my reputation with the few people who actually did hold me to some strange high regard.


Hey but lets play the be the better man game right quick, or should I say be the better Wom/man game, cause I dont want to exclude any specific gender, cause I might offend someone.

Would you, you being whoever is fucking reading this piece of shit, would you actually instigate this situation, the situation being some person, who you or may not know being a bafoon by taking em on in like a pissing match?

Ya, point the fingers at me, thats fine, I accept that, never once said I wasnt being drunk and or stupid, but how many times did I say to kick me out of the channel if you didnt like how I was presenting myself?

At one point you say that the channel wasnt endorsing my behavior.

Bullshit.

You wanted a show and you got it.

If you didnt I could have been kicked, muted, refused to continue on in a conversation with a person who was never going tobe rational, and you surely wouldnt have posted it on the reddit for even more bullshit for you roll around in.

Because lets be honest, thats what this server is anymore isnt it?

A pigs slop pen, and were all waiting for the farmer to bring us our daily dose of slop to revel in.

Thats why this server can never be an ""experiment""

Unless you take experiment in the sense of a bunch of teens taking drugs, and I dont mean the shit shoved down your throats for your attention deficit disorder, unless of course it wasnt prescribed to you, lol ""prescribed"" then it is quite the productive drug.

And to the ones that say, oh, dont leave the server ron.

Have none of you realized I dont ever play?

Like ya, oh we dont want you to leave, well miss your prescence on this server.

Wait, what do you mean  the login records show hes only played a total of two hours in the past few weeks?

I couldve sworn he was here this whole time.

Ha.

I guess this post comes off quite bitter dont it?

Like a lonely, petulant child.

I guess its somewhat true.

The fact that I spent my whole time for the past year, arguing about meaningless, and set up problems we made for ourselves, while avoiding reality, fooling myself into believing that in the future things would magically get better.

But they are though, the less I play here, the less I deal with the people here, and the problems here, the more shit outside of here gets better.

And to think, this all started over a what, 5 minute convo whilst inebriated?

A commendable attempt at forging an alliance between the nations of +/+ has failed miserably, [being exposed as fraudulent and self-serving](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1f3fn0/what_a_nice_alliance_you_have_there_comped/). *Comped*, the man who has attempted to organize the alliance known as SEAT (a shameless copy of the last millenium's SEA), has been publicly denounced by *_dbb_*, the leader of Prussia. After realizing that his empire was deceitfully placed into the alliance, *cetracey* has officially withdrawn Petrania from SEAT, claiming that the terms under which he agreed to join were non-existant. *_dbb_* Has threatened to declare war against *comped* if he does not remove Prussia from all documents pertaining to SEAT.

**Capturing Of Lawman Shows Power Of Criminals**

*Belthazor*, a griefer-turned-lawman, has recently announced his [retirement](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1f3e41/i_quit_good_info_please_read/) from bounty-hunting. This occurred right after he was raided and griefed by *niggerbrigade*, who had pearled him earlier this week. With the proliferation of factories and brewing machines, all citizens are urged to equip themselves with gear to fend off this rampant horde of griefers, encompassing more criminals than just *niggerbrigade*.

**Monks Make Holy Sacrifices In The Name Of Their *Server* God**

Recently, there have been many [reports](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1f3m1o/30_donation_train_now_departing_join_us_in/) of ritual sacrifices of something known as *dollars* (the currency of a far-away land) towards the God known simply as *Server*. While it's unclear what these sacrifices intend to do, it is recommended that all CivCraft citizens follow-suit, whether out of sheer curiosity or perhaps full support of this mysterious *Server*.

**New CivCraftians, Take Heed**

A recent [public service announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1f2v2v/to_all_of_the_newfriends_who_think_having_a/) released by *Griffin* has been released, and it is advised that all new citizens of CivCraft read the message thoroughly, lest you be swept up by the tide of justice.

But following the Hobbitton incident and other such things, a few helpful pointers would probably not go amiss. Time to de-lurk.

First of all, new players, newfriends, aren't particularly liked right now. The reason is very simple. Like always, the 2.0 launch wasn't exactly smoothe, and there is simply not enough space for everyone who wants to play Civcraft at the same time. Now, imagine you are a Civ-veteran. You have a faction, and you have been planning towards the 2.0 launch for weeks. Every day, every hour counts, if you want to get a good start for your faction. And imagine that the slots that dedicated players would use to get building and fighting are all occupied by fresh new players with no real plans or understanding. It's no wonder there is a lot of frustration right now. The server is a dangerous place now, when it is in a power vacuum, and newfriends are even more at risk with lots of angry veterans about with frustrations to take out on your cobbleshed. But there are things you can do.


N.o 1: If you are starting a village, don't advertise the coordinates. If anyone can find you, the meanies will, too. If you do reveal your position, someone will come, sooner or later, that isn't coming to admire the cobbledick statue. Stay under the radar, for the time being.


N.o 2: Be ready for guests. If you can, make sure you've got armour and weapons. If you can't, make sure you can scarper if meanies are approaching. In Civcraft, you have to hold what you take with strength, and a sign and a Reddit post won't keep the baddies out.


N.o 3: Hide yo' valuables. Anything that's worth having is worth hiding. Either carry it with you or bury it in a well hidden chest. Use your imagination! Unpleasant company is less bad when they haven't stolen anything that matters.


N.o 4: Reinforce and rebuild! Sooner or later, someone will try to dismantle what you've built. You'll have to rebuild your things at some point, that's how it goes on Civcraft. Build things to last, and above all, learn how the Citadel block reinforcement plug-in works and use it.
Short version: Smelt cobblestone to stone -&gt; equip stone in hotbar -&gt; type /ctr -&gt; click the blocks you want reinforced -&gt; type /ctoff when done -&gt; blocks reinforced, more difficult to break.

N.o 5: Find and associate with like minded individuals. This will provide mutual protection, along with actually reducing server load (less chunks being active). (Cheers, valadian!)

And those are the best, immediate tips on how to avoid getting wrecked right away, and to minimise the amount of inner QQ when it does eventually and inevitably happen.


Now, the final tip is the one I intend to do. Namely, stay off the server for a few days, until the server's more stable and all the veterans and factions have settled in a bit, which will probably reduce newfriend resentment. If you haven't got a big plan of your own, it's better to leave prime time server slots for those who do, and join in later.

Just an idea. See you when things have calmed down a bit, lads!",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1369074487.0,,,True,t3_1epi4l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1epi4l/helpful_advice_to_new_civcraft_arrivals_do_do_not/,

-------

* Civcraft 2.0 online. Very sorry for the delay, but we had to spend quite a bit of time testing and then running the initial backup. 

* We are starting with a 125 player cap, we will move up as we see fix. 

* Updated RealisticBiomes
&gt; * removed unintended glowstone ability from netherwart
&gt;* changed netherwart growth in jungles to deserts
&gt;* changed potato in End from 1.0 to 0.1
&gt;* reduced ideal tree growth rates from 100% to 4%
&gt;* diversified tree growth in biomes according to species (checking the rate will still incorrectly report the base tree rate because it's checking the generic sapling material)

* Updated Citadel, placement of Hopper carts and hoppers below chests you do not own is disabled, but this is currently not perfect protection, please reinforce the blocks below your chests for the time being if you wish to be perfectly safe. 

* PrisonPearl currently has a known glitch where if you pearl a combat-tag npc you will get the pearl, but no message telling you that you pearled a player. Since you do get the pearl perfectly this is a minor bug. 

* The guidebook spawning changes to humbug where not included in the current build due to last minute errors, please read the guide post and we hope to have a working guide book spawning system at some point in the future. 

* Please check the guide I will be posting in just a moment for more details about 2.0, please tell me if there are any questions or things I should add to the guide. 

* Remember, this map is still in testing for the next week, please report any bugs you find to use in Modmail as quickly as you can. 


* I would like to thank all of you, thank you for your help and support, have fun.

Honestly it was like Crysis style shit, with perfect facial animation on top but shitty blocky mc movement down below.

Anyways, hear me out. So I'm chillin' in good ol mercer, when suddenly Caiden comes out of buttfuck nowhere and starts doing this weird ass dance. Now, I've never heard his voice, but I'm pretty sure my mind hates him because he literally sounded like Kermit the Frog. 

Anyways, Caiden is dicking around and I'm contemplating suicide. Also, his dance was the dance that the Tauren does in WoW when you type /dance. Shit was off the walls. Then it all went wrong. A bear came out of nowhere but fuckin' Caiden was like ""FUCK YOU BEAR"" in his kermit the frog voice and literally starts beating the SHIT out of this poor ass bear.

Turns out the bear was ttk2 in disguise but Caiden would not stop punching him directly in his bear mouth. When caiden finally stopped ttk2 had a perfectly crafted cappuccino in his hand and had a british accent and was talking about Spurion and all this weird stuff. At this point I wasn't really paying attention because a Ford Model-T comes rollin' down main-street carrying some nerds (probably faces from that thread) and they all start bitching about  cappuccino's and their fuckin' impact on the environment.

Next thing I know, caiden's throwing down with these nerds. BUT, long story short, they weren't nerds. They were like that dude from the Atari Guy video that RT put out. Fuckin' rad. Anyways, caiden gets his balls kicked in by these nerds-who-aren't-nerds and they start chasing me.

Now for those of you who don't know me, i'm some scrawny dude with a euro haircut who makes the ladies go wild. What i don't do, however, is fight karate masters in the shape of scrawny white nerdy preteens. So i BOOK IT. I hit the Nether Portal and guess who's on the other side.

Also I am growing tired of explain this to people on context of the [Nether Road Map](http://www.hpoom.co.uk/CivCraft/map.php).

**Unoccupied does not mean abandoned!**

The nether road map has never shown abandoned portals and never will. Greyed out portals are unoccupied. This is now made even cleared by you needing to interact with a button that says ""Show unoccupied portals"".

Unoccupied means these towns might not have active players in them. This does not mean players have given up their land/property rights. These [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cgsit/must_see_cities/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cgxlu/question_salvaging_abandoned_property/) today, talk of abandoned towns. I don't know any towns that are abandoned.

I myself own land and property in towns like Liberty, Populi, and Saga. I still own these property. I still visit them once in a while, and I still have possessions at them. Just because Saga and Populi are not active does not mean somebody can come and claim my stuff.

In short. Stop misusing the word **abandoned**. Instead thing twice and use the word **unoccupied** or phrase **not active**. Saying abandoned leads people to think they can claim what is not rightfully theirs.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,t3_1chfvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1chfvn/unoccupied_does_not_mean_abandoned/,

* After significant amounts of research I keep on finding mixed reviews for Black Lotus when it comes to Minecraft, many of them where not hosting with them but instead remotely and proxying traffic through them. If we decide to move to Black Lotus and they prove to be correct about their problems it will be a mistake costing a minimum of $600 if they refuse to refund us. We currently have $1100 or so to spend on hosting over the next couple of months, so it would not be the end of the world to lose $600 but it would put a large dent in this. Since moving the physical server to Black Lotus makes us committed insomuch that the machine must be physically removed from their location I would like to try upgrading the JavaPipe VM we have now at the end of this billing cycle and giving that a try. Even if the improvement is not as large as I hope JavaPipe is $100 cheaper per month, thus we will save money for trying rather than lose it as we may by diving in with Black Lotus. So, its your money, what thoughts, comments, and concerns do you have?

* What would you all think of allowing normal users to edit the subreddit wiki? We can set minimum karma and account age requirements so I think we could feasibly keep the content of quality. 

* I went ahead and made an affiliate account, lets see if they like my application. Also how would I make a universal affiliate link or code? As it seems I can only link to one product at a time with the affiliate linker. 

* Lets start digging up those advertisement plans, regardless of if we end up moving back to Titan or to an upgraded VM we will want to move on advertising soon after. Last time a significant complaint was that there where too many political players and not enough 'joes' to simulate a real society, I think we have that problem solved. 

* Finally if you are a developer and have some spare time go ahead an join us in the CivcraftDev google group and direct your efforts to either per day pearling cost in PrisonPearl or JukeAlert. 

----

Changes for Civtest:
---

* It seems the Portal style testing initiative has sort of fallen flat, in retrospect we probably put the cart before the horse as we need to enumerate what design we want. Ideally what we will need is a series of test chambers that run through puzzles that involve testing gameplay mechanics. For example one room should be you are given pearls and must teleport in a way that confirms that FnDragons fixes are working. In another room you would need a partner, whom you would pearl and then summon onto an otherwise unreachable platform for example. Once we know what we want to do in each chamber designing a map should not be too difficult. 

* It would really be a great help to me if people could hop on Civtest and run through Citadel and Prisonpearl, I will be happy to give you what you need and otherwise help out how I can. We have lots of changes over there in need of some serious testing that could improve the server as well as fix various bugs. 

* What is the ETA on an alpha build of JukeAlert to throw up to Civtest?

Since everything has seemingly calmed down, I feel I owe many people who were affected by my actions. I know what I did was wrong, stupid, childish, and what not. I have been reforming my actions and I think one of the final steps of reformation is a reparations thread to make amends with those I have wronged.

These reparations will have some guidelines though:
---
* **Anyone who fought actively against me will not receive reparations.** 

&gt;This may be done on a case-to-case basis, message me if you fall under this category.

* **Wanting reparations such as 100d / day.** 

&gt;Claims such as me shouldn't be put on me to blame since I'm paying reparations. I never had access to the World Border Vault so it would have been impossible for me to free you.

* **Crimes committed by HCF as a group. If you can prove I was there and did damages, I will pay you back.**

&gt;Do not put the blame on me unless you have either snitch evidence or a verbal story that I can remember.

In order to receive reparations, post in the following format:
---

* **Name** (Your IGN)
* **Your claim against me** (Story of what happened. This may help in me remembering if it happened if you cannot supply proof.)
* **What you are seeking** (Items / Love)
* **Proof** (This is highly recommended. Post with proof get higher attention than those without.)

Extra Info:
---
* Hurt feels and other joke claims are not wanted here, they deter from the players who have actual claims against me.

* Any Myra / BHC / Gimmick / WP that are in alliance with those who are holding innocents will not receive any reparations. 

**Why should I pay people doing the exact same thing as I did?**

* If an arbitrator is requested, we will pick out a person who we can both agree on. 

* Upvote for visibility. This is a self-post so I receive no karma for it.

It's a renewable resource that only involves cutting down this unlimited supply of forest!"".  




In other news, as the counter attack on Augusta further devastates the city, comrade Naeemt has declared himself Dictator of Augusta. He explains that his need for autocratic powers derives from a wartime situation in which Democracy only hampers the defense of the city. Some dissidents among the exiled Augustans claim that he's in fact an HCF sympathizer. But if anything, political divisions during a time of war only hampers the effort of removing the HCF savages.

I'm Theodius ingame and I live in ++. I sell potions and wood and currently own a business with my friend which sells potions in opportune locations across the nether and in some cities.

Very few of you will know who I am, as, aside from trade and occasional sightseeing, I rarely enter the 0,0 areas and generally dislike sticking around in any of Liberty/Augusta/Rothbard for too long. That's my personal preference.

Today, however, having already spent a while helping Agraria to clean up their cobble grief (more on that later), I found myself trapped in Augusta (I had been checking a shop I'm invested in and logged out there a few hours earlier). This was with no weapons, armour, resources - nothing, really, except various worthless bits of garbage. I was trapped due to the portal being blocked up, pointing to the HCF players on the other side.

After a while I volunteered to, essentially, commit suicide, by being let out of the city, as the guys on the inside wanted to know the situation surrounding the nether side of the portal I wanted to get back home and continue with my business and had nothing of worth so, hey, why not. I was promptly let out and the minute I rendered the other side of the portal, I was pearled. To be expected, really. 

What shocked me, to some extent, was what happened next. I had been led to believe that the HCF were mindless bad guys who were out to prove they were better than the AnCaps at PvP and level every citizen and city on the server in the meanwhile. I'd also heard plenty to the contrary in recent days and so, whilst not quite believing that accusation, I wasn't sure that they would let me go. 

""Hey, I was in Augusta for trade and I logged off, I've just turned up trapped. Live 10,000 blocks away, any chance I can go free?"" 

""yeah sure""

...and I was free. Just like that. So I ran home, got my iron gear together (just for a minor bit of protection), grabbed my Bane of Arthropods V (yes. I think the RNG was playing a trick on me that day) diamond sword and a whole bunch of various, top level potions, to dole out to the valorous citizens of Civcraftia should I get the opportunity. And so I, and friends, headed out to the portal.

This is my next point of contention and the thing that got my back up generally. As I got to the portal, I pm'd Josh and asked how I and my friends could help. He replied by saying, if we can't fight (I can, just not well), the best thing to do would to log off and allow other fighters to join.

Now, first, I would like to point out that I am not criticising Josh in any way, shape or form; this sort of advice is probably given to people in a situation of this gravity. My issue is that it contradicts the nature of the game. We're supposed to be playing as a community of different cities and cultures and, during a time of war, chipping in to help eachother and do what we can, in any way. Something about other citizens with perhaps less-than-exemplary gear being asked to log-off in favour of those better equipped irritated me a little; especially with this wild-scale stigmitisation of the HCF and 'in this together' attitude.

The second example of this was when we got to Rothbard (Josh informed us to get to Rothbard if we wanted to help). When there, I asked the first recognisable player there, Greg, what we could do. His response? ""Not no go away"". I said I can help, and I have friends far better geared than me that could help. ""in iron?"" was the response. Fair enough; I still have highest level potions (which, I gotta point out, were required later on by a few people). Again, this just seems extremely rude and belittling of people who want to help. I don't have a thin skin; this interaction just sorta...in one ear and out the other. But again, it contradicts this idea that we're supposed to be a community fighting against the big HCF bad guys.

That was it for me until I logged in later this morning and asked about the situation. I was told the HCF guys have been banned for x-raying via world-downloader - some were happy, some were extremely critical. I have my own viewpoints (again, see below). Either way, I started my journey back to home when, near 0,0, I was warned by Matticus that a few rogue HCF were around and about pearling everyone they saw as a protest. I stopped to eat (which would be my downfall) and have a peek around; I saw them come from the tunnel and pegged it. I was, unfortunately caught, as my speed pot ran out whilst I was eating and I didn't even notice. Pearled, once again.

I spoke to the pearler, Supposed, and he said it was a protest, and that I would be released when his/her friends were unbanned. I responded that I thought the banning was a little harsh myself and had been sympathetic to HCF people recently (which I had). Guess what? Unpearled on the spot for being gracious, non-abusive and talking. And they threw in a brewing stand as a thankyou.

That's pretty much where it ends and my conclusions are as follows:

1. The stigmitisation and generally pariah-like treatment of several HCF members is pretty ridiculous on the server. We all have our political leanings and views on the 'ancap clique' but in a lot of places the mere mention of the acronym 'HCF' seems to make every frown. It's ridiculous and while, yes, a few of the players are volatile, I'd say there are an equal amount of horrid players who have nothing to do with HCF. (I also realise the actions of RattlerTank/Twiggy have caused the title of HCF player to become such a dark mark, but-- still.) That said, Apache and Gordge weren't pleasant people, but a lot of their bravado is the same as a lot of the absolute garbage thrown around on the internet these days. In fact, so-called 'reformed griefer' whosnick came out with some of the most appalling insults (involving Downs syndrome and the like).

2. AnCaps are, to put it plainly, rude in some instances and expect to have their own free reign over the server, in both ingame and meta senses. Matticus was perhaps the only polite one I spoke to all day; and other people were outright ignored when trying to offer help.

3. Perhaps the worst crime the HCF are guilty of is releasing players who are far worse than they will ever be - honestly. The HCF truly seem to prefer to PvP over all else - they seem to enjoy fighting man-to-man rather than large-scale griefing (touch wood, touch wood!).

4. On what basis have they been banned for hacking? I realise that this server is not a democracy and the admin's word is final, but really? Banning them on the probable basis that they might have kind of used world-downloader once to look at a map maybe? It doesn't sit right with me, and, from the sounds of things, several other normal regulars on the server.

This is more an outpouring/spewing of thoughts on today and the general attitudes of various players. All I will say is that the HCF have risen in my estimations and the AnCaps have sunk, a lot. I have appreciated the work they've done in the past in regards to bounty hunting and such, but their attitude/egotistical nature sucks.

As a final thought, while we were all racing round the 0,0 area of the nether chasing eachother, Agraria and Gerald both received pretty horrendous bouts of griefing by at least one notorious, previously vaulted criminal. I know that the HCF players released them, but perhaps we weren't chasing the real bad guys.",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1356079354.0,,,True,t3_157vwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/157vwu/a_relative_outsiders_story_and_viewpoint_on_the/,

This is a sincere apology to all those who were banned. You are unbanned. None of the players you un-pearled were re-pearled, but if they were they would be re-un-pearled. 

The last six attempts we had to deal with on Foofed's vault were all illegitimate, and in fact previous to this have been our single best tool for discovering new Citadel exploits. When we look at the logs and not only see the block breaks are less than the minimum required, but also see Citadel stack traces, our programmer eyes start to well up and panic, and we assume a form of exploitation has been used. The other six times, those assumptions were well-founded. Upon manual inspection it appeared that you didn't break a lot of the blocks you would have otherwise had to break if this was a perfectly constructed vault. This obviously wasn't the case, and you have our sincere apologies.

You were banned for a period of about thirty minutes while the few of us who were online tried to work out what happened. We spent that time waking up both the Citadel coder and the coder of our logging systems, we did everything we could to isolate the exploit and fix it ASAP... only there wasn't one. We can't change the fact that you got banned, but we can offer an apology to those involved. We made a mistake. There was a bug in Citadel, but it wasn't helping the instigators of this incident in the way we thought it was; to find this out we had to wake up Citadel's developer and talk to them about it. He wasn't very happy, we weren't very happy; it's not been the happiest of times to be honest. Citadel is our most integral plugin with a database of over 4,500,000 entries... to put it lightly, Citadel is catastrophically and irrevocably complicated, and maintenance of this data is... not easy. Exploits in the plugin have to be dealt with immediately.

I'm sorry. TTK is sorry. Exultant needed to sleep halfway this, but I'm sure that in the depths of his dreams he heard the cries of a thousand angry Mumble packets and felt something akin to the emotion of sorry.

1356013021.0,37,self.Civcraft,1561n8,"[Rant] The proper response to bigots on the server is to not ""play"" with them.",65,28,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1561n8/rant_the_proper_response_to_bigots_on_the_server/,"Since returning from hiatus I've noticed a lot more casual racism, sexism, and homophobia in mumble, chat, and subreddits. I'm also bothered by folks hemming and hawing about the ""rights"" of people to say and do certain things in-game that have a very real, toxic effect on the out-of-game society we live in. Talk about trials in our little block buildings and similar play-theater as a response to bigotry is a bit offensive to me, and I want to make it clear why.

Words are signifiers, and the social hierarchies these words signify manifest in a very real way in the lives of people who are discriminated and aggressed against, and in the worst cases can lead to pogroms, holocausts, and lynchings. *All of these worst crimes against humanity begin with and are sustained by ""mere words"" which became attitudes, depending entirely on how people exactly like you and I chose to use and respond to them.* Words have consequences, I know this is hard for a lot of folks to swallow but it's a truth validated again and again throughout history.

Bear that in mind next time you see bigotry in chat or mumble, ""gag"" accounts based on racial stereotypes, or sexual harrassment of the unfortunately few women who play. There is a very real person on the other side of that screen and every other screen privy to our interactions. Civcraft being ""Just a game"" doesn't mean that you should set aside all your real-life principles to play for in-game ""realism"", just as it means you shouldn't let your real-life self get bent out of shape about in-game drama. Bigotry, however, is not an in-game fantasy, it is a real-life problem manifesting and reproducing itself in-game. Allowing bigots to hide behind the ostensible liberal freedoms of Civcraft is like playing chess with a klansman and thus excusing his insults of ""blacks"" as being part of the game, you're the one being played. How you choose to treat those who spread bigotry is up to you, and if you confine yourself to an in-game mentality you're ignoring and at worst enabling the spreading of their filth in a broader context. 

It also bears mentioning that **it does not violate your liberty to afford others a basic level of dignity and courtesy.**

This is a good time to step *out* of the game and ask yourself what kind of community you want to be a part of, who and what you'll tolerate in the games you play, and what social conventions you want to communicate to the younger and more impressionable players. Would you tolerate somebody in a pickup football game or D&amp;D game yelling racial slurs other players? Probably not, if you're a decent person, so why tolerate it in Civcraft with some appeal to ""play-rights""?

My bottom line is this: **My real-world commitment to anti-bigotry trumps any in-game commitment to free speech or any other ""play"" like that.** I have no interest in humoring or ""playing"" with racists, sexists, and homophobes; and I seriously doubt Gandhi, Dr. King, Harvey Milk, Susan B. Anthony, and others would be at all interested in appeals to Augustan constitutional law or debates as to whether pearling an obnoxious bigot is a violation of the NAP. I find appeals to in-game notions of justice and principle re:bigotry extremely hollow because they imply the toxicity of bigotry and the consequences of tolerating it are contained to the game. It is more important to me that bigots be shunned, humiliated, and ostracized than maintaining the authenticity of this ""simulation"" for my amusement. Choosing to *play* with these people and humor them through in-game mechanics should not be a foregone conclusion, it's a choice you have to consider before even clicking Minecraft.exe.

------------------------------------------------------


**tldr:** Get real, games are a social activity, and so a conduit for the mediation and reproduction of social relations. When we play nice with bigots and lend them an ear in the name of ""in-game free speech"", we're tolerating and ultimately encouraging their behavior in a broader, real-world social context. It's akin to saying, ""Racism is a detriment to society, but not bad enough that it can't be entertained in my little block-stacking game, because we're making politics n' stuff.""

So, as one real-life person to another, please do whatever you can to make this game horrible for anyone who wants to use it as a medium for bigotry, and please blow off whatever pathetic attempts they make to pull the conversation into a strictly in-game sphere. Do the same also to anyone who tries to defend tolerating them based on appeals to in-game ""principles"" or ""legality"".

When you see people calling each other ""faggot"", ""nigger,"" or using insults like ""...like a little girl."" Tell these folks to fuck off, please, and if you go so far as to pearl them you wont hear any complaints from me. As far as I'm concerned, they can take their ball and go play another game. 

**tltldrdr:** It's just a game, just because it contains certain political microcosms doesn't make it any less socially detrimental to humor and play with bigots instead of properly shunning them. There is a person behind the avatar.

your pearl-holder is being unreasonable. That's where I come in.

myself with a few simple pieces of information, and I can help get you
free, so long as you do 3 things:

what reasons so far you are aware. Also include the current
coordinates of your pearl, which can help illuminate who currently has

accidental or not.
* 3. Be patient. Don't make too many posts asking to be released on
the subreddit, don't state information about people or jump to
conclusions unless you know something for sure, and do NOT try to get someone to go break you out.

Facebook and the Reddit familiar to me had been read up on, so I decided to reach into the void for something new; I started to click the random button.  Several strange, uninteresting pages floated by when one caught my eye with its minecraft banner.  I paused to look, it appeared to me as a subreddit for a particular server.  As I scanned the page, it intrigued me.  I was no stranger to minecraft, but I felt as if there was something unknown, something mysterious about this place.  My wanderlust took hold of me and I was soon on the server.

I spawned, moving my consciousness into another world, a simpler world.  My first sight was not of a grand gate, mansion, a row of portals to far-off lands, other players, or any sign of welcome.  I saw nothing.  I was alone, in a hilly forest of tall trees and snow.  A message instantly flashed across my mind: ""You wake up in an unfamiliar place.""  Indeed I had.  But I knew that I could not stand there pondering for long, for a nagging feeling told me that I must find shelter until daylight came.  And so I set out, striding headfirst into adventure.

As I collected the bare necessities and created various tools to assist me, I was plagued with questions.  Where am I?  How big is this place?  How many people are here?  Do they wonder about these things as I do?  The forest was still quite dark and I though it had been peaceful thus far, it was an uneasy peace, like the kind one feels when their gut senses danger but their body cannot.  I decided to try and make contact with someone, anyone.  Fearing the presence of monsters I raised my voice and asked, ""Are there any mobs on this server?""  Another message flashed across my mind: ""No one hears you.""  Ignoring the question of this omnipresent entity entering my mind, I decide to assume the worst and find some shelter.  I trekked back into where I had dug some stone out of the side of a hill.  I start to create some more room and create a workstation to keep myself busy for the rest of the night when I hear a short hissing sound, followed by a loud bang.  Instantly I felt my mind torn from my body, placed in some sort of... limbo.  My vision was tinted an ominous red, and I was prompted with two options, to be respawned or leave this world.  My curiosity being far from satisfied, I decided to try again, vowing to be more careful this time.  

I again suddenly found myself in a forest, with the message ""You wake up in an unfamiliar place.""  Who was this all-seeing being?  I wanted to know, but I was faced with a more immediate, pressing question:  Where was my stuff?  I frantically searched myself and the immediate area, but none of my belongings from my previous... existence were to be found.  Hmph.  I hiked through the forest to a clearing atop a ridge, hoping to spy some familiar terrain.  In one direction the forest I had just been in extended as far as the eye can see.  In the other direction, across an icy river, appeared to be the forest I found myself in the first time.  I raced to it, hoping to find comfort in some familiarity and maybe even finding where I died.  But as I paced through it I saw that it was not the same forest; the trees looked the same but this one was more mountainous than hilly, more rocky than covered in soft cubes of dirt.  Disappointed, I again started to gather means of survival.  As I worked, I noticed that this landscape wasn't untouched as the first was.  Gravel in a neat stack beside a drop-off, clumps of leaves oddly floating in the air, and other oddities gave me hope that others might be around.  I again raised my voice and offered a meek, ""Hello?""  Again, the message flashed, informing me that I was alone.  But this was progress, and I was determined to find civilization.  

Once I felt prepared enough to travel, I did.  I crossed forests, climbed mountains, swam across lakes, all the while looking for signs of others.  My heart lept when I peered down from a cliff and saw a small house with a measly wheat farm next to it.  I quickly hobbled down to it, only to find it abandoned.  The house was empty aside from a chest containing nothing and two signs on the wall.  One seemed to be a snarky note from one player to another, the other a message from what I guessed to be the owner.  He stated that he went on a trip to some sort of Greek-sounding city, along with a date:  6/30/2102.  My birthday.  Seeing that this was December now, I guessed that he wouldn't be coming back.  Nonetheless, I repaired his floor and walls, left a sign with my name and the date I was there, and continued my search.  

I crossed more terrain, finding an odd torch here, mine hole there, but nothing substantial.  Time passed and it was getting dark.  I decided to keep moving, for some reason feeling safer that way.  Soon after dark I strode up a grassy knoll and saw a magnificent house!  It was large, bright, well decorated, with a large field of wheat growing around the lake in front of it.  I started to run over to it, but stopped myself:  What if there was someone here?  Would they be friendly?  Would they attack me?  I drew my unwieldy stone sword and slowly approached the house.  

I didn't see anyone, so I decided to push on one of the doors and step inside.  Another message flashed, this time red and seemingly angrier: ""DOOR LOCKED"".  Eerie; everything looked normal aside from there not being a soul in sight.  My curiosity overrode my respect and I decided to break my way through the wall with a pickaxe.  To my surprise, it worked rather easily and I was in.  I carefully fixed the wall and then turned to survey the inside of the house, pleased with what I saw.  It was well lit inside as well and had a comfy orange and white wool rug.  Along one wall under a window was a workbench situated in a stone countertop, with a flowerpot in the corner.  Along another wall were a pair of stoves.  Above the stoves were the stairs, which led to a large upper room containing only a bed in the corner and another workbench.  I busied myself with the stoves and workbench, sorting and crafting the materials I had gathered on my journey thus far.  Soon it was daylight, and I decided to take a break and explore around the house.  

I first went back to the wheat farm by the lake.  There was wheat everywhere!  I took a bountiful harvest, careful to replant the plots.  It looked like it hadn't been tended to for some time, so I fashioned myself a hoe and touched things up.  With night coming once again, I headed back to the house.  

I again worked with and organized my now many belongings as the night passed.  Suddenly, one of the times I turned to the workbench, I noticed two chests on either side of it.  Had they been there all this time?  Odd.  Maybe the fatigue was getting to me, I had been roughing it for the past few days.  I tried the chests, and they were unlocked.  One contained some miscellaneous farming and food items, the other some utility stuff and building materials.  Hoping the owner wouldn't mind, I took some materials I needed out of one chest and continued working.  Once I was done, I replaced what I didn't use and gave the owner a little extra of my stuff for his hospitality.  Turning to leave, I noticed that the mysterious chests had changed once again, now having become larger and taking up nearly all of what I was sure had been a stone countertop.  I knew they weren't like that before.  I quickly crafted some signs and posted a warning inside the house that it may be haunted, along with a thanks to the owner, then got myself out of there.  Ready to continue my journey, I immediately stumbled upon a group of animal pens beside the house.  Several sheep, cows, and a pig made lots of noise when they saw me, I suppose they hadn't been cared for in some time.  Feeling bad for them, I jogged back down to the wheat farm, grabbed some wheat, and fed them.  That done, I felt I could leave and not feel guilty.  

As I walked away from the house, I suddenly remembered my other life.  I had things to do there, things that could not wait forever.  I then pulled my consciousness back to reality, ready to conquer my tasks there but eager to continue my adventure in this wonderful world of right angles when I could...",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,t3_14fpr0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/14fpr0/my_first_couple_hours_in_this_new_world/,

It all began in Kizantium: NKCamp and I were hunting down a raider that Mister_Hilter had informed us of. I felt a chill, a funny feeling of danger and external forces, but shrugged it off. I hadn't been on all day, it was just the jitters. I noticed that I was unable to send or receive messages, but I shrugged it off as a fluke.

We ran at the raider, and I killed him, pearl in hand, to send him to the End to learn his lesson. But when I attempted to summon him, I was met with a chilling message: This is an ordinary pearl.

**An ordinary pearl.**

But...what had happened to the man I had just slaughtered?! NKCamp reached out to him, and established that he was in fact in the End. But he was a man with no soul, imprisoned with no pearl. I passed the pearl to NK, my mind spinning. He examined it and threw it, hoping to reverse whatever terrible curse had befallen me. But it vanished, and the raider stayed in the End.

NK went into the nether, only to be confused: there he saw a Sami_Ghani, standing motionless. Assuming I was simply dumbstruck by the events that had just transpired, he nudged me into the Kizantium portal. I went through, with him close behind. But he was shocked to see a motionless Sami next to him, and another peering into the iron door!

I was the one at the door, confused and distraught as to why a doppelganger had appeared, dressed as I was with my name. NK did the only logical thing: he slaughtered the Nether-spawn beast. But the beast shocked us all by dropping a cloned copy of all my possessions...and the pearl of the raider. NK tried to give me some of the items, but I couldn't even pick them up.

It was as if I wasn't even there. As if I didn't exist. 

I could place blocks just fine, and destroy those I placed. I could give away items, but not receive them.  The server was reset. I respawned...dead in the Kizantium portal, without any possessions.

Am I the real Sami? Was it all an illusion? My mind is replaying those eerie events in a loop, yet I have no answers.

----

* As many ideas as we have for the second iteration I think we should strive to keep it simple and not go too far with it. That being said figuring out how far is too far may be a little difficult, we may end up doing 'false start' testing, where we put up a new map and after a week evaluate if it should be kept or not. When the answer is a yes we have our new map. 

* As a note, we are accepting maps for testing from anyone, if we like them we will need to know how to generate one of our own of course to prevent us from just coming full circle to this situation. But I am very interested in what any of you can create. 

* Veins and ores, ideally there will be a light sprinkling of all ores (except emerald) all across the map but veins will still exist. The map will also probably be smaller and custom generated, meaning spawners will have to be added manually if they are to be in the map at all. That being said without spawners we can up the spawn rates such that dark grinders may actually be effective. 

* JukeAlert is a must for our update and I would be very interested in seeing something like the proposed time delay strengthening of reinforcements. 

* Opinions seem mixed on morephysics and factorymod, when it comes to factory mod I think it deserves at least a go, but with the regular vanilla crafting system intact but make more costly than the factories. 

* Enchanting enchanting, first off if we want to enable anvils we need to see if the latest lore based version of PrsionPearl will have problems with that. Next up we need to evaluate the new enchants and costs and see how much we can make them serve our purposes better. 

* Keep in mind here that addressing major problems does present major costs in its own way, the idea of tracking alts via a form participation controlled white list does seem to have some understandable resistance. But if we truly wish to handle this critical problem we need to decide what we can trade for it. 



Changes for Civcraft:
----

* While we work through everything Civcraft will remain situation normal for the time being, operations will continue as scheduled while we get what we need to get done.  

* Proposed: Move development and testing to 1.5 once we roll this new PrisonPearl version. 

* ariehkovler promoted to minion level moderator. The invitation of new Janitor level moderators is pending a short debate with existing admins. 

* I have been informed that several people have gone way out into deep nether, normally I would not care, but in our current state we have neither the processing power nor the disk space to spare for such an endeavor, at the end of the week (Sunday) I will border the nether at 15k and delete all chunks generated outside that range. 

* In the next week or so we will restart the server and have double the ram and processing power from Javapipe, we will be running on this as a month to see if a scaled up VM can serve our needs as the cheapest DDOS protected hosting option we have, if it fails to do so we will work out one of our collocation hosting offerings. 


------


Changes for Civtest:
----

* Erocs has returned and is has now created [this](https://github.com/erocs/JukeAlert.git) copy of the JukeAlert github which I suggest everyone work off of if they desire to contribute hopefully we can get it ready for testing in the near future. 


* I updated Civtest to Prisonpearl version 1.6.2, please check whatever pearls you have created and see if they where converted properly. Provided they have been we will move forward with upgrading to this new version during the nether trim period on Sunday.

With the server reset we'll need to set aside all of our differences to establish civilization. 

First off some things we take for granted like superiority over griefers will not be so in a few weeks when everyone's vaults are emptied and hordes of griefers will be free once again, and worse, we will not have the same war gear we have now to stop them. 

Second, All of the infrastructure that I personally, and I'm sure others take for granted will be gone. No nether roads, no existing portals, no established farms, no nothing. Each faction can decide their own priorities, but clearly continuing feuds should not be one. 

So therefore I'm asking that everyone put down differences and work together now to help out in any way possible for the reset of the map, and to help out once the map is reset that we may more effectively establish civilization on the new map.

That being said I think many players have been acting out of impulse in the face of a server reset, and I think those actions should not be considered going forward as criminal. I honestly believe that we should consider all players as non-criminals going forward in the hopes that the ranks of the reformed might grow next map; yes that means a general wave of all current civcraft claims to crimes and claims to reparations obviously. I do think that the records should stay up to better target possible future griefers.

* **I am going to go ahead and layout the defense to what eagles is going to say so that everyone knows.** 

* Reason my brother and I waited a day to post: I thought that Hamster was going to be banned for cheating and playing with 2 pearled alts.
* Lem0nland91111s connection with Lazerwolf22022: Lazerwolf22022 is my little brothers account. During the original HCF war my account lem0nland91111 was pearled fighting crashete and because I had no alt and my brother did not like pvp, he gave me the Lazerwolf22022 account to play on. Eventually the war ended and I founded Arx and no longer had any need for his account. so, I gave it back to him and he begin playing on it, helping around Arx. 
* Any log in log out data: At my house we have two computers. A shitty laptop and my gaming computer, so there are plenty of logging records of us both playing at the same time but it runs into a problem when we take turns using my gaming computer. The solution to that would be showing on the logs the amount of time online between accounts because it should be significant. 
* Why Lazerwolf22022 does not make sense to be my alt anymore: After I gave my little brother back his account I bought an account replacing it as a combat alt. This account is Lem0nland91112
* Why it was not me who got pearled by hamster at Arx: First off I never walk around without prot4 on and some pearls. Second I know hamster is bad news so why would I converse with him at all (before being pearled) and not logout when he was looking at me? I also would not of wasted time talking to my captors. I would of immediately started messaging Allies. 
* Why my little brother told Hamster he was lem0nland91111: My little brother had gotten use to random people thinking he was me and does not like to explain himself to people so I told him if any unknown player talks to you its ok to pretend to be me unless they state things you can not understand or tell me. 
* Why I made the post for my brother: He is in 6th grade. I think it would be better if a 16 year old defended him instead of a bunch of teenagers and adults attack a 12 year old.
* I believe TTK has proof to show Lazer and I are different people because about 6 of us play at the same school. so, he has spent a lot of time sorting out false alt banns. 

* I do not know how helpful this is but, a lot of trusted people can vouch on what I have said. 
* **Facts Everyone Should Know**
* Lem0nland91112(me) helping guard the miners when RK was being freed in no way represented Arx(I was the only one from Arx there) therefore it is unjust coming to Arx and killing defenseless people. 
* Everything owed to my little brother is listed in screenshot evidence and considering the way Eagles is acting I doubt my bro will ever get it. 
* It is quite pathetic that these guys say and or think they are helping people after actions like this.
* I will never pay any reparations to Eagles or his guys.
* I will continue doing everything I can to bring them to justice. 

* **probably forgot a lot because the post was rushed so ask any questions**

Without further ado, here is the first episode, in 2 parts:

1363765021.0,38,self.Civcraft,1anh2y,The secret is out.....and you are in for quite a surprise!!!,71,33,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1anh2y/the_secret_is_outand_you_are_in_for_quite_a/,"This is going to be a very long wall of text, but for those of you who are not interested in reading the following information is the most important.

NJpalms - space_code 
Inspectorbellend - TeaJizzle
lifetime - cliffnerd5
duplicatas - Positronic 

Now as you can see from the above with regards to myself and the accusations made against me by NJpalms you can see why he was told to leave Black Stone Keep and was not welcome, you should also begin to understand why he reacted in the way he did after the incident by pearling me and xXTB.

When he broke into Black Stone Keep to pearl myself and xXTB he had never been inside the keep before and neither had cliff, yet they both knew the exact spot in the roof in which to pearl through to land on top my Iron grinder and have a birds eye view of the inside. Which implies they have been here before on a different accounts.

The other players involved in this group have come forward so far but now that we know who the rest are it makes perfect sense since they all hangout in mumble together for the most part and have close ties with each other on the server.

If we look at positronic first it has been noted before the incident where he actually had the pearl of Duplictas and released him "" by mistake "", we also know that he was one of 3 people on a certain snitch network which had all of the above group added to it(space/duplictas/turbo etc). So the evidence there in its self should make people ask questions.

TeaJizzle is the most disappointing of the group after speaking to him numerous times and listening to him constantly defend the above individuals beyond the realms of any sane individual, while people are free to play Civ craft how they like one would expect more from a admin on the server.

I have been a target by these individuals I believe because of my prior association with the jacks and the fact that they think I may rebuild my new town in the same way and perhaps effect the power base they have erected around them selves, it is quite obvious they believe they are untouchable at the moment.....after all if they can do what they did on alt accounts and remain free then what do they have to be afraid of?

It is well known I have close ties to the LSIF and that I'm more than willing to take in anyone who has no claims against them/reformed and paying them off as long as they are willing to abide by the rules I have laid out. 

As I said in my last thread Th3Joker_ infiltrated my group and after my main account rkwildcard was pearled he attacked lalleholm pearled him and gave him to the above group.

So they have spent quite some time it would seem planning this.....

And while I have not posted any evidence at all it will be published by the source who informed me of this, as there are screenshots of the chat logs which will corroborate all of the above which I have stated.

So the question is what are we going to do about it? I for one have no interest in remaining pearled at the hands of these griefers and there allies any longer.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1amym9/my_alt_pearled_and_more_fun_at_blackstone_keep/

Those people I have named above feel free to come clean now ;) it will be mildly less embarrassing for you if you do so before the SS are made public for the whole community to see.

Edit: Positronic came into mumble to speak to me and I Assume spoke to the other people involved and hence TeaJizzle outing thread here. http://i.imgur.com/2Aa0Aog.jpg

Well, this is boring after a while. Is anyone interested in building an old-world style city? Compact, small lots, high density, working with the terrain instead of just leveling it? Staircase streets, mini-plazas, different levels, bridges, narrow roads that aren't necessarily all straight, maybe part of it built into a cliff face or canyon...with an eclectic but tastefully done architecture (no ""box"" houses).

1359397677.0,35,self.Civcraft,17fw52,Reintroducing Revolutionary Science: call for papers and a general introduction.,36,1,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17fw52/reintroducing_revolutionary_science_call_for/,"As some of you may know, Revolutionary Science was an automatically updated bookworm journal back in the pre-book writing update days. A brain child of bodhidharma, the original edition sought to inform readers on science and technologies related to minecraft and civcraft, as well as their implementation here. The journal sizzled out regrettably after only a few issues.

I have taken the opportunity to re-publish the journal here on the subreddit in .pdf format for popular readership. I have also broadened the scope of the content to include analytical pieces about the societies of civcraft, given the current context of the server, their power relations, and histories of the server.

I should note what I envision from this publication: I'd like it to be a pseudo-intellectual thing, with content always relating to the server however informed from real life theories or thought, much like what we do here on our server, ""Our backstory is based on history, not fiction."" Indeed this current iteration of *Revolutionary Science* should do the same. Moreover, the publication should serve as a culture and community builder, in other words creating or supplementing the current sense of community on the server in a reflexive sense. But it is also partly tongue and cheek with some roleplaying mixed in.

With that said, the next issue of [*Revolutionary Science*](http://i.imgur.com/a6hBxB5.jpg) should be released sometime this weekend, notwithstanding any huge issues. So far the essays have trickled in, and the reader can expect some thought provoking and inspiring reads, including:

* A Communist Analysis of the HCF Invasion and its effects on the Power Structure of the Server - drafted by Synthion
* A Marxist-Tolkienian Analysis of the HCF Conflict - authored by bodhidharma
* A Reflection on the Accuracy of the Modeling of the Server - authored by Tambian Sinclair
* A Durkheimian Analysis of the Server's Division of Labour using the LSIF as a case study - authored by aMerce; and
* a personal retelling of server history authored by bobpndrgn

So you can expect a very interesting read with this one.

What I'm expecting by releasing this post is three things: firstly to advertise the publication, secondly to round out the debates contained within this issue dedicated to the analysis of the current HCF conflict. It should be noted that a rounded debate on these issues should be presented in such a publication, and I'll strive to keep it as balanced as possible. This does not mean that I'll cut out any controversy, however. Civcraft is a drama machine, regardless.

Thirdly I'd like to open the call for papers to the general public for the reasons mentioned above. If you have a novel perspective on the server (such as bopndrgn's) or a unique perspective of the recent HCF conflict, leave a comment bellow and I'll provide anyone interested with some general guidelines.

But please, only serious inquiries will be considered. Controversial pieces welcomed!

You might remember the OreGin plugin I made that added in an automated mining machine into the game, which allowed for more industrialization, a higher tech tree, opportunities for economic expansion, etc.

After talking with a lot of players and trying to take in as much feedback as possible, I decided to expand on the idea of 'Machines' like OreGin. I've begun the abstracttion of my plugin so that it will hold a collection of 'Machines' somewhat similar to Ore Gins.

I've heard some people's suggestions for potential machines they would like to see in CivTest (for now at least), but I'm interested in what you want to see. These are the very rough and basic ideas so far:

-----------------------

**Super Furnaces:** The ability to construct a large furnace that would take a particular type of fuel (preferably a material that is under-used at the moment to stimulate the economic desire for it). Then, the machine would have a double chest it takes as 'input', and another double chest beside it that it takes as 'output'. It would take the blocks/materials from the 'input' chest, smelt them quicker then a normal furnace, and then place the smelted materials in the 'output' chest. So, as you can see, a super furnace. It would be more expensive/complicated/difficult to build then a regular furnace, but it would smelt quicker and would allow for more large-scale smelting projects, since you can just load a double chest full of the materials you want to smelt, fuel it, and then let it go until it's finished and all the smelted materials are in the chest.

**Auto Farmer:** The idea behind this machine is still very very rough. However, the general concept is a farming-related machine that would help streamline and automate large-scale farming operations. Not much more is concrete behind this. It could be as beneficial as automatically harvesting and re-planting farms as long as it is fueled, or even just a notification machine that outputs a redstone signal if the particular crop it is monitoring is fully grown/ready for harvest. So that players can go into their home, see a light go on and know that their farm is ready to harvest, etc.

**Poor Mans Excavator:** The premise behind this is a (somewhat) cheap machine that players can build and place. Once they place and activate it, it will look for iron/gold/diamond ores in a specific radius around it, and then point in the general direction of the closest ores. It would require fuel, but the premise is that an efficient and smart player could use it to streamline their manual mining efforts to locate veins.

-------------------------------

These are all rough general ideas for potential machines, and I'd love to hear everyone's feedback for the pros/cons of these machines, and what potential ideas YOU have! If you see someone else's comment that you agree with / also want, I hope you'll upvote it so I can see what players like the most depending on what was upvoted the most.

I hope everyone is as excited to add more complexity, industrialization and tech trees to CivTest. If not, I'll just crawl back into my hole and tinker with Ore Gin's :)

They shouted to our Lord ttk2 blessed be his name that a war would reinvigorate Civcraft from it's stagnation. It's what the server is all about, right? The trials of civilization. War and strife.

Well you got one. 

Players who have been here since the beginning, who have witnessed the rise and fall of the greatest cities to have graced the server, who have endured, now retreat. Beaten. 

Players who went out of their way to help others, to give resources when they could, to rebuild cities time and time again. Gone.

With the numerous amounts of differing ideologies, we've all disagreed on one thing or another. What to do with pearls, how long should a griefer be put away for, how trials should be setup, what makes a government's or state's claims legitimate. That was the beauty of Civcraft. Bickering and discussing and fighting. And then coming together when it was needed. Fighting together. 

The war itself has and will have numerous consequences. Consequences that aren't apparent to the average player. Will the victor have the patience to deal with the fallout of pearling numerous amounts of players? When they pearl innocents and griefers alike, will they go through the painstaking mumble trials and give out reperations? What's going to force them to do that? Nothing but their own will. What about the cleanup of cities? Are the victors going to share the spoils of war with the true victims? The workers, the civilians, who's small wealth were plundered, their shops vandalized, their homes destroyed. The nether roads? Are they going to police them and keep them safe? Or is it once again going to be easy pickings for seasoned raiders?

And what of the history of the server?

Before the war, most people in positions of power knew the server's history well. Will they even care about our history? The importance of cities like Rift and Cressmopolis, the founding of Columbia and Lazuli, the revival of Aristopolis, the rise and fall and rise of Augusta? The Pumpkin Jacks? Occupy Columbia? SEA, Communa, Havana? Haste? Infinius? The death of Lazuli, and the collaps of Columbia? Haven, Atmora, Gerald and its glorious sheep? Rapture? The ILS, the Citadel, the tournaments of old and new? Instead of looking back at all that has happened, all that has changed and unchanged, new players will look back and see only HCF. Only war. The new history begins will the fall of the oppressive CKC, and the rise of the HCF, Baddies, Wu Tang peace brigade.

With this new history, great players, who had strengths and weaknesses, pros and cons, liked and disliked will be forgotten. Cities with their long histories will be abandoned. Eventually, far into the future, they will get bored. And soon enough, the lands will be empty.
