I plan on including lessons for intermediate level editors as well in the future. We will begin with the basics of Editing and move on to specific tools later. While there may be plenty of Editing Suites available, the core functionalities/features are common across all of them. 

We will be using this subreddit along with the YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/InteractiveTutorials) for the lessons. Since, this will be an interactive course, I encourage everyone to ask questions. I will be monitoring the individual lessons as well the comments for the videos. And, while I understand that you might be curious about future lessons, please hold off questions that are not related to the lesson at hand. 

Each lesson builds upon the knowledge of the previous lessons. Therefore, you are adviced to proceed sequentially. If you have doubts about a specific lesson, you can always come back for a review.

While everyone might have their own idea of how to apply this knowledge, it would be helpful if I provide you with some ""real life"" case studies. 

There are many channels on a website like YouTube. Some people use their skills for purely recreational and entertainment purposes. They make anime or music videos or fan edits/movie trailers. Some are more interested in Politics, and they successfully use their skills to make their point and, at times, reach a large audience. Some take part in social causes by volunteering to make informative videos for charity organizations. YouTube recently organized a video contest to encourage people to take part and help out these organizations in raising awareness for a particular issue. There are also those who share their knowledge and educate others on subjects like Science, Technology, environment, Religion/Atheism, cuisine, etc. And, there are some who only use this skill for personal or official work. While you might not agree with  (or be interested in) the content produced by some of these groups, it is important to realize the commonality in all of them. Regular people have been successful in contributing and sharing their ideas with the rest of the world with relative ease. This would not have been possible a few years ago.

So, what I am trying to get at is that Video Editing can serve as another medium of expression for those who are interested. Did you ever have that experience of listening to a beautiful piece of music while making up images in your mind? This is what video editing essentially is, IMHO: Putting your thoughts into video. And, it is not just the special effects and music but the quality and content of your thoughts that makes up a great video - the underlying theme. Therefore, you do NOT necessarily need to be an After Effects Whiz to make your point. The objective of this course is to equip you with the ability to translate your thoughts into videos. Later, you can learn more about improvisation and special effects.

From basic trimming software to full on edit suites, this list has something for everyone. 

*This is not a FULL list, just the most popular and common options.*

**Free Software**

- [Windows Movie Maker](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download) - A basic video editor that comes as part of windows Essentials. Though it can be difficult to get the hang of at first, it is probably one of the better free PC options out there.

- [EZvid](http://www.ezvid.com/): A great option for screen capping or just basic editing for youtube. Comes with free music to use with your projects, but sadly can only upload videos to youtube.

- [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/): Another simple free video editor, though not super intuitive, can be used to combine multiple video clips into a single one.

- [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/): Similar in function to Virtualdub with a few more abilities, Avidemux is a simple cut/append/adjust editor.

- [Wax](http://www.debugmode.com/wax/): A Free Compositing and video editing software. This will take time to learn, but it is powerful for a free program.

- [Blender](http://www.blender.org/): A Free 3D modeling/video editing software. This is another piece of software that will take time to learn.

- [Lightworks](http://www.lwks.com/): A video editing program created by video editors, this free NLE looks like one of the more full featured options out there. I'll be testing this out sometime and will add my thoughts later! *thanks to [heroesforsale](http://www.reddit.com/user/heroesforsale) for the suggestion!*

**Basic Paid Software**

- [Premiere elements 11](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html): Price, $99 - A powerful but affordable editing solution, great for basic hobbyists or casual users.

- [Sony Movie Studio Premium](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope/videoediting): Price: $95 - Similar to Premiere Elements with a few other features, this is another great piece of software for the casual user or for someone who needs a basic but decent featured editing program.

- [Pinnacle Studio 16](http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/Pinnacle+Studio+16.html): Price $59 - A Decently featured consumer editing software.

- [Sony MoviEZ](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviezhd): price $44 - Similar to iMovie and Movie Maker but with a few extra options, this is an affordable basic editor.

- [VideoStudio Pro x6](http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4900075&amp;cid=catalog50008&amp;segid=8100022&amp;storeKey=ca&amp;languageCode=en): Price $79 - Another decently featured editing software, at a decent price. 

**Professional NLEs**

- [Premiere Pro](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): Price $799 - A Great professional NLE. When purchased as part of the Creative Cloud or one of the many Creative Suite Bundles, this is one of the most powerful editing suites on the market today. This is what I use on a daily basis as a short form advertising editor.

- [Avid Media Composer](http://www.avid.com/US/products/media-composer): Price $2,499 - Another big name in the industry, Media Composer is one of the most used NLE's in the broadcast industry. 

- [Final Cut Pro x](http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/): Price $299 - One of the more affordable professional options. This piece of software does still have it's place in the professional world and has become much better since it's original release.

- [Sony Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro): Price $599.95 - An NLE that doesn't seem to get much love, but is plenty powerful for professional level editing. Another one of my personal favorites.

*thanks [CitizenSam](http://www.reddit.com/user/CitizenSam) For reminding me about Vegas!*

**Video Editing Suites**

- [Sony Imagination Studio 4](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/imaginationstudio): Price $175 - This suite contains a video Editor, ACID music creation, audio recording software, and DVD authoring software. There are also color grading and VFX plugins inlcuded. This is a sort of ultra-consumer package, not really for professionals or serious hobbyist, but for others who just want the ability to do more than the average editing software can do.

- [CS6 Production Premium](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/production.html): Price $1,899 - This is probably one of the best editing suites on the market today, containing all of the software you need to create all sorts of professional content. 

- [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html): Pricing $49 a month for one year, or $75 month-to-month - With adobe Creative cloud you get access to every adobe program for a low monthly fee. This subscription based software makes it easier for people to get started in the industry without having to invest thousands of dollars in software. $600 a year may seem like a lot, but upgrading from one CS to the next can cost upwards of $1,200, or the equivalent of 2 years of Creative cloud (which is also there upgrade schedule). In the end it ends up costing about the same but it much easier to digest for small companies or freelancers. I will be switching to this here in the next year or so myself.

Since, there are quite a few here who have had no prior experience with Video Editing, I've started with the most basic editor that comes pre-installed with Windows Vista.

1348596721.0,48,self.VideoEditing,10gmrx,How to Become an Editing Ninja by Making Your Own Movie Trailer,57,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/10gmrx/how_to_become_an_editing_ninja_by_making_your_own/,"Hello r/videoediting,

I see a lot of people asking 'how do I become a better editor?' or 'where do I start learning'? Well, here's a tutorial for a cool project: edit a trailer for a movie you love.

If you put in some time and effort, you'll:

* Get practice with your editing program of choice
* Learn how to edit to music
* Learn how to make cool titles
* Learn about pace and tone

And most importantly, you'll learn how to tell a *succinct and exciting story*.

You'll also get to play with amazing footage shot for millions of Hollywood dollars. Better than your buddy's skateboarding video, right?

I'll be using three example trailers in this tutorial:

[Flight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ53JCLG9I0). It's an excellent trailer, but also pretty archetypical. 

[The Social Network](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4). Which I think is the best trailer ever made. 

[The Andromeda Strain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMbSpnlOOtE). This is a trailer I edited, using the techniques in this tutorial (basically I'm 'throwing down').


**Step 1: Pick a Movie**

Choose any movie you like, but you'll make your life easier if you pick a movie you love and are familiar with. It also helps if the movie isn't heavily scored (i.e. music). When the pros edit a trailer, they have access to raw, un-scored footage, but you'll have to make do with the final mix. Although you can sometimes get away with it, you don't want the movie's score interfering with the music you're editing to. I chose to edit a trailer for The Andromeda Strain because it has no musical score at all, which meant I could pick any line of dialogue in the movie and use it in my trailer.

A final thing you may want to consider is that modern, well-edited trailers for old cult/nerd classics go down well on YouTube. If you want dem views. Just sayin'.



**Step 2: Pick some Music**

I cannot emphasise just how important your music choice is. It'll tell your audience what kind of movie they're watching, it'll tell them how to feel, and it'll set the tone and pace. If you get it wrong your trailer just won't work. To be honest, picking good music is very tough. It's a real art form and I can't possibly explain it in this little tutorial. But what you're looking for music that's emotive and exciting. Don't just pick music you like. Trailer music isn't normal music. It's music with balls. Gargantuan balls. It needs to build and crescendo, it needs to be exciting and catchy, it needs to make your audience go 'cool!' or 'wow!' or 'omg I'm crying!'

Your safest bet is to use music from an existing movie soundtrack (I used music from Sunshine (2007) in my Andromeda Strain trailer). You're guaranteed that it'll have that 'movie music' feel.

Picking a regular track can be trickier, but if you get it right then the trailer will really come alive. The trailer for Flight is mostly scored around Gimmie Shelter by The Rolling Stones. The STONES, man. How's that for balls? The track builds and crescendos and makes the second part of the trailer feel really explosive. But it has quieter, cool moments too. How about that bit with John Goodman at 0:59? Awesome.

For me, the trailer for The Social Network just knocks the ball out the frackin' park. It works in four (yes, four, count 'em) ways. Firstly it's Radiohead's creep, a classic college rock song for a movie set at a University. Secondly, it's a choral cover, which feels very Ivy League and upper class (for a movie about wanting to be 'the elite'). Thirdly, the lyrics match the action of the trailer and the theme of the movie to an absolutely eerie degree. Finally, the song just perfectly grows and soars and becomes absolutely epic. It's perfect trailer music that perfectly matches the film.


**Step 3: Edit**

Ok, so step three is kinda big, right? Let's just dive in. What you want to do first is watch your movie and take copious notes. You're looking for stand-out shots and pieces of dialogue for your trailer (don't list everything you'd like to use, you'll be there all year), but more importantly you're looking for an angle on the story. This is why it's useful to pick a movie that you love. How would you explain the story to someone who'd never seen it before? How would you get them to be as excited about it as you are? Could you explain what the movie was about in a sentence?

When you've thought about that, we can begin. What I'm going to do is outline a really broad structure that most trailers follow. It's just a rough guide, don't treat it as a hard rule about how a trailer 'must' be structured. It's just a useful tool to get started.

Trailers have three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. Or I think of them as 'mystery', 'story' and 'KABOOM'. Here's roughly how they work.

**Beginning or 'mystery':**

* Flight: 0.00 to 0.59
* The Social Network: 0.00 to 0.54
* The Andromeda Strain: 0.00 to 0.45

Remember the guy who'd never seen the movie? This part is you saying 'did you hear the one about…?' What you want to do in this opening section is intrigue your viewer. Tantalise them. The Flight trailer shows us a regular day on an airline jet and then - BOOM - Denzel wakes up in a hospital bed. Straight away we're thinking 'what's happened'? It's a crash, sure, but… something's different. People keep talking about 'miracles' and 'the way you landed that plane'. In the Andromeda Strain trailer, we know there's a secret underground lab for dealing with stuff from space. But what's inside? What's happened? People are getting sick and there's suggestions of contamination and sinister motives. The Social Network trailer takes a different approach. It shows us Facebook, and by juxtaposing regular Facebook images with the lyrics of the song, it gets us thinking 'why do we use Facebook', and reminds us that it's now an everyday part of life. When this movie was put into production, everyone said 'a Facebook movie? Are you kidding me?' but this trailer gets you interested, lets you know that the movie is going to be smart.

**Middle or 'story'.**

* Flight: 0.59 to 1.51
* The Social Network: 0.54 to 1.49
* The Andromeda Strain: 0.45 to 1.20

So the-guy-who's-never-seen-the-movie-before says 'no, I haven't heard the one about [blank], but that sounds really cool'. This is where you say 'well, what happened was…'. Get into the meat of the plot without giving too much away. Outline some characters, give us a sense of when/where the film is set. But most importantly, you have to tell us where the *drama* is. In Flight, although we still don't know exactly what happened with the crash, we learn that Denzel's character is both hero and villain. He saved the lives of everyone on the plane, but was he flying drunk? Did he cause the crash in the first place? In The Andromeda Strain, we know there's been an outbreak, and that people are working to contain it. But is that possible? Can an Alien virus be contained? In The Social Network, we know that Mark Zuckerberg is looking for fame and fortune by designing The Facebook, but what lengths will he go to to get what he wants? Will he betray his friends? Is he an amoral person?

**End or 'KABOOM'**

* Flight: 1.51 to 2.32
* The Social Network: 1.49 to 2.31
* The Andromeda Strain: 1.20 to 2.00

The-guy-who's-never-seen-the-movie-before says 'oh my holy god that sounds amazing!' He's astounded, fascinated. This is when you just throw pure unadulterated awesome at his brain. Lift him from 'astounded' to 'gibbering wreck'. Save your best shots for this section. It's all-action, all-drama. In The Social Network, the final section starts with Eduardo Saverin slamming Zuckerberg's laptop into the desk as the soundtrack reaches a crescendo. We get a series of crazy images of hedonism and people going out of control, of broken hearts and crashing empires. We have an old man's voice (a voice of authority) saying 'your best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars'. Holy shit this movie sounds amazing!

In The Andromeda Strain, we've got people running, asphyxiating. We've got lasers and spacesuits. We've got people arguing, losing hope, smashing things in a rage. We've got someone saying 'you knew it, stone! You knew it!' Knew what?! And under it all, the virus continues to mutate.

Flight is similar, but it breaks with my formula slightly, because there's sort of a break into 'KABOOM' at 1.51, then it kinda rolls back into 'story', then there's another break into 'KABOOM' at 2.11. So once again - this *mystery-story-KABOOM* formula is just a rough guide. Don't feel you have to stick to it slavishly.

**And Finally...**

One more thing before the end of the tutorial: Let's think about the opening image and the closing image. I don't mean the specific shots you open and close with, I mean the image you grab people with, and the image you leave them with.

Unless you're a massive Denzel Washington fan, and his face is enough to make you sit up and pay attention, I'd say the 'opening image' in the Flight trailer isn't until 0.23: a bloody eye opening. That's when you think 'ooh, what's going on here…?' The Andromeda Strain opens with 'don't be scared, I'm a doctor', then BAM, we've got a sinister, lone man in some crazy sci-fi lab. It's a simple conflict between what someone says and what we see/feel. The Social Network trailer opens with Facebook, and to be honest I think that's enough because we're thinking 'oh, the fabled Facebook movie, I've read about this one'.

What about final images? The Social Network closes with a great little exchange between the chairman of a board and Zuckerberg. He says something that doesn't quite make sense and she says she doesn't understand. He replies with 'which part?' Basically: this guy doesn't make sense, he's a nerd and socially awkward, but he's the smartest guy in *any* room. The Andromeda Strain uses a bookending technique. I opened with 'don't be scared', and closed with 'I'm scared, oh lord I'm scared'. So I'm hammering fear down yer throats. And Flight… oh baby. It closes with an image that just completes the whole trailer. We've been hearing for almost three minutes about 'miracles' and 'I don't believe it' and 'nobody else could've done it' and then - boom - *a plane flying upside down. Holy shit.* BRB, buying a movie ticket.


So… that's that. TL;DR version = edit a movie trailer, you'll learn stuff.

While it is great to have a good vocabulary, it is even more important that you understand the context in which words are used. And, just like any other skill, you develop this ability through practice over a period of time. Therefore, you will need to understand not only these techniques but the correct context in which they are used to get your idea across your intended audience. 

I will demonstrate the usage of each of them as well as when to use them individually in the coming lessons. Go slowly and make sure you understand each of them before proceeding to the next lesson. Take your time, and feel free to ask questions. I'll be monitoring the lessons regularly.

1362766111.0,36,self.VideoEditing,19x9hp,How to Chose a Computer for Video Editing,41,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/19x9hp/how_to_chose_a_computer_for_video_editing/,"This is a basic guide broken down by type of project. These are basic standards that I have found working with many different systems over the years, figuring out what kind of power is required to do what. These guidelines are for individuals, not groups of people. 

**Breakdown of project level**

* Beginner: Single video stream (one layer of video), titles, background music, export to youtube or DVD. 1-15 minute long videos. This could be a home video for grandma, skate/sport video, birthday party, gaming montage, etc.

* Enthusiast/hobbyist: 1-3 streams of video, a little color correction, titles, graphic overlays, basic 2d animation. 1-15 minute videos. This could be a small documentary, basic commercial, budget youtube series, etc.

* Entry Level Professional freelancer: 1-5 streams of video, multicam, moderate amount of color grading, basic visual effects, titles, overlays, and more. 1 minute to 1 hour long videos, such as commercials, documentaries, web series, etc.

This is where I will stop because most people beyond entry level professional freelancer have the working knowledge of what they need. The extent of my experience is a Dual Xeon Mac Pro with 32gb of ram and a few raids for the disc setup. 

**It is strongly suggested you build this system yourself, Buying a system that meets these specifications can be extremely pricey. The base prices listed are for built systems**

**Beginner**

* CPU: Current generation i5 or AMD FX/Phenom processor. Intel costs more, but is more powerful.

* RAM: 8gb

* HDD: 7200rpm, set of 2, one for OS and one for projects/render/cache/etc.

* GPU: GT 640 or higher for Premiere Pro, comparable AMD card otherwise. Do not use integrated graphics.

* Price: $800+

*[Sample Beginner Build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Ipxc)

**Enthusiast/hobbyist**

* CPU: intel Xeon (1230 or 1240 as of this date), Core i7 3770/3770k. If you'd like to save a little you can go with the high end AMD 8 core, which performs on par with the 1230 v2 for $30 less.

*Thanks to Proxi_Pixel for letting me know how well his 8350 rig performs!*

* RAM: 16gb

* HDD: 3 Disk setup, one 7200RPM HDD/SSD for OS, one 7200RPM HDD for project data, and one 7200RPM HDD 
for cache/render/previews.

* GPU: GTX 660/560 or higher for Premiere pro, comparable AMD card otherwise

* Price: $1,300+

*[Sample Enthusiast/Hobbyist build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/IpBz)

**Entry Level Professional**

* CPU: Intel 3930K, best bang for your buck as far as high powered CPU's go

* RAM: 32gb 

* HDD: This can go many ways, refer to this [post](http://forums.adobe.com/thread/662972) to see best options depending on budget

* GPU: GTX 680 4gb for premiere pro, comparable AMD card otherwise. At this point you may be using software that requires Quadro, in which case you will have to purchase. The reason I do not suggest quadro for Adobe is because the GTX 680 is more powerful than the Quadro cards, but much cheaper. You may also need a dedicated monitoring card if you're doing high end broadcast work.

* Price: $2,500+

*[Sample Entry Level professional Build with some disks for a few RAID 0's](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/IpGw)


**In all cases it is wise to have a daily backup. an external HDD or external RAID just for backup is best.**

Now some of you might want laptops, which I strongly suggest against unless you WILL be working on the go. Laptops are less powerful and are harder to repair/upgrade when compared to a desktop.

**Beginner Laptop**

* CPU: Current gen i5, 2.5ghz

* Ram: Upgrade to 8gb

* HDD: upgrade to 500gb 7200rpm HDD plus an external 1TB drive for projects you're not working on.

* GPU: Nvidia if you're on adobe, AMD if anything else. Integrated graphics are OK but not suggested.

**Enthusiast/hobbyist Laptop**

* CPU: Current gen i7, 2.3ghz+

* Ram : 16gb of ram, **make sure the mobo of the laptop can support that amount of ram**

* HDD: Internal 256gb/512gb SSD, external 2TB HDD for holding old projects or things you're not working on.

* GPU: Nvidia GTX 640M or higher, comparable AMD if not using adobe. **Do not get integrated graphics**

**Entry Level professional**

* At this point we're talking about a $2,500-$3,000 laptop specifically made for video editing.

**Monitors**

This is where things can get tricky. I suggest only IPS monitors, even if they are cheap. Why? Because TN pannels have color/gama shifting across the viewing angle, while IPS does not. 

*1920x1080 resolution recommended* 

**Beginner**

* Dell or LG IPS, $160-$250

**Enthusiast/hobbyist**

* Dell IPS, $300-$600

* Apple Cinema Display, $1,000

**Entry Level Professional**

* This is where things get pricey, if you're doing professional level broadcast work you'll need some color accurate monitors, which can run $2k+ easy.


**These are merely suggestions, not set rules. You can get by with much less, and you can also need a lot more. I have personally worked with systems comparable to all of the above. I own an i5 laptop myself, an i7 920 rig at work, an i7 3770k at home, and I set up and use from time to time a Dual 6 core Xeon (Dual X5650s) Mac Pro at the local technical education center.

If anyone has any suggestions, please comment. I will be putting together and linking to builds on PCpartpicker and linking to prebuilt systems that have the specs needed here over the next few days.

1268644822.0,28,self.VideoEditing,bdiva,Lesson 3 - Separating Video and Audio Tracks in Windows Movie Maker,33,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/bdiva/lesson_3_separating_video_and_audio_tracks_in/,"One of the major limitations of Windows Movie Maker is the inability to directly unlink audio and video tracks. Therefore, when you split/shorten/extend a video track, the changes are reflected in the audio track as well. This seriously restricts the scope of the operations you can perform on your video project. However, there is a workaround that you can make use of to get the desired result.                    
                        
Consider the following scenario: You have 2 music videos i.e. A and B, and you'd like the visuals of the A to go with the sound track of B. Windows Movie Maker has only 1 Video Track (and a linked Audio Track) and 1 Audio track, and no additional tracks can be created. Drag A on your Video timeline and B on you Audio timeline. Mute the audio associated with A. Change the tracks A and B, as needed.                      
                   
This simple step will allow some additional control over your video project.              
        
Tip: Just like the video clips, you can add the ""fade in"" and ""fade out"" effects to your audio tracks too.           
               
Edit: Since, this lesson only involves a few steps, I haven't included any screen cast. Please let me know, if any of the steps are unclear. ",,False,,t5_2ri0h,True,,,True,t3_bdiva,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/bdiva/lesson_3_separating_video_and_audio_tracks_in/,

Today, we'll have a look at manipulating video clips in Windows Movie Maker by performing operations like splitting, applying effects and transitions and , finally, rendering the video in Wide screen for publishing on YouTube.                       
                 
Most of the operations are quite basic and after getting familiar with this editor, you'll realize that there's only so much you can do with Windows Movie Maker. We'll take a look at these limitations in one of the upcoming lessons. In this way, you'll be able to appreciate the functionalities and control offered by a commercial editor like Sony Vegas or Adobe Premiere.                    
                    
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0CanU36jY              
                      
These 2 lessons were primarily introduced to give beginners a feel of the basic tasks, terminologies and concepts involved in Video Editing. As a result, moving on to an advanced editor will not feel as intimidating. I suggest everyone to work on a simple project to make themselves familiar with working on the timeline and adding effects/transitions.

We're working on a large scale video series. We work on iMacs and all our footage, templates, audio etc is run off 4TB GDrives connected through Firewire 800.

Our videos are educational, so each edit is a lesson (which is around four minutes) that we cut together in a separate sequence, so each of our projects has all the media on the hard-drives imported into it and all our sequences are contained within that project to speed up our workflow (so we don't have to constantly import tons of media for each time we start a new lesson.)

The problem we're running into is that PPro just takes way too long to open the project and find all the media. It takes over an hour of battling, rebooting and ejecting and reconnecting harddrives till the project loads up and the Media Pending screen goes away. Till that happens, we can't play anything on the timeline (it stutters along at maybe 1 frame a second before stopping), the audio constantly cuts out and it's just generally unusable.

In the bottom left and right of PPRo, we can that it is loading clips and generating peak files, but after about 10 minutes it finishes all of that yet the project still hasn't loaded properly. Eventually it loads up and we can work, but it kills productivity like you can't believe. We get in the office at 7:30 and can battle for three hours just trying to get stuff working.

We have a major deadline to get out 30 more cuts by next Friday and simply can't afford to lose this time.

We've tried clearing out all the PPro Preview files (there was about 30GB worth.) which didn't help.

We've tried opening different projects on different iMacs (ranging from mid-2010 to mid-2011 models) but there's still no way of knowing exactly what the issue is and thus not being able to find a solution.
Does anyone have any ideas at all that we can maybe try look into? It's driving us crazy!

Now every time ""making money"" is involved, questions rise and I'd appreciate any feedback possible.

1. **What do I need to take care of legally before I can charge people for my work? Do I need to create a trademark or patent a company name or brand for the videos I make?** 
I basically wanna avoid getting sued or doing anything illegal.

2. **What are some average rates that I could charge people for my work? Hourly? Length of video?** 
I know it always varies but a good foundation is what I'm looking for.

3. I've been using **Sony Vegas Pro** since **Vegas 4** and am extremely fluent with the program. **If I were to take this freelancing more seriously, are there video programs similar to Vegas that can handle a heavier workload?** 
Vegas crashes more frequently as more and more FX are added so that's why I'm asking.

4. For people who already freelance. **How's it going for you?** Care to share any helpful tip on ***what to do*** and ***what NOT to do***?

I recently asked a question about editing in Premiere vs After Effects and got a great response from you guys, so I figured what the hell, I'll ask another question.

This time I'm curious, what is the best way to edit 720p and 1080p footage in the same composition? The reason I ask is because my camera (like a lot of others) shoots higher frame rates at 720 vs 1080. So if i want something in slow motion it's best to shoot it at 720p. The question/problem I have is i want my final composition to be a 1080p composition. So, how do I go about ""upscaling"" the 720p footage to fit the 1080p project? Is it as simple as dragging the corner of the clip, and sizing it to fit the 1080p window? Surely there will be a loss in quality, but is it noticeable when just uploading to say.. YouTube? 

How would you guys go about this?

I have two main questions:

**Question 1:**  
My headset (Razer Chimaera) is what I am currently using for audio recording.  I know its not a dedicated mic, and will probably be buying a blue yeti or whatever the newest craze is soon, but for NOW, I have the following options for the mic:

----------------------------------------------------------

2 channel, 16 bit, 44,100 Hz

2 channel, 16 bit, 48,000 Hz

2 channel, 16 bit, 88,200 Hz

2 channel, 16 bit, 96,000 Hz

2 channel, 24 bit, 44,100 Hz

2 channel, 24 bit, 48,000 Hz

2 channel, 24 bit, 96,000 Hz

-----------------------------------------------------
Am I right in assuming the biggest numbers are the best?  And the next question that comes to mind is that most of the games that I play have better audio quality than my mic can record.  So when I encode, what should I set the audio bitrate to?  I am using HandBrake, and I can set it to as high as 384 kbps audio bitrate.  This would be 2 channel 192kbps stereo audio.  My understanding of the whole 2 channel x 24 bit x 96,000 Hz thing is that it would be recording 2x24x96,000= 4,608,000 bits per second of audio, or 576,000 bytes/second, or 562 kbps.  So anyway, my understanding is limited.  I don't know what any of this means.


**Question 2:** 

I currently have 8 GB of RAM, which was sufficient 8 months ago for building my gaming rig.  2 months ago I started doing recording and editing.  How significant is the RAM that I have for editing/encoding?  Do I need more RAM?

The ISO on one of the DSLRs was 3200+ for most of the event. The lighting there was terrible ... I knew there were a few denoising plugins out there so I made the call to film at a higher ISO. I ended up settling on Neat Video's Reduce Noise plugin for Premiere Pro CS6. It is unbelievable how much better this looks! I never want to plan on cranking the ISO up so high but if I must ... I at least know I don't have to worry about it being unusable.  

The only downside I can think of is this 7 hour render time! °o°  

I am using a AMD Phenom II X6 1090T and thats comparable to an Intel Core i5 2500. Neat video allows for you to also allocate all your graphics cards to help but one of my cards actually slows it down so I am using CPU+1GPU mode.﻿  

I might post an example here when I am done editing but honestly I think YouTube's compression will likely hide the difference. This project is going to BD-R at 25Mb/s and the noise would have been atrocious if I didn't remove it.

This is my first post in this part of Reddit and I had a quick question for you all. What is the advantage of editing everything in Premiere Pro, and only doing my ""effects"" in After Effects. Currently I manage to edit everything from start to finish completely 100% in After Effects and it comes out quite well IMO. I can't help but feel however, that this isn't the correct way to do things, and definitely isn't the way the ""Pros"" do things. 

I notice that most pros edit between the two programs (from various blogs and articles), but have the majority of their workflow in Premiere. Why is this? What advantages does editing in Premiere have? I'm a bit hesitant to make the switch because I'm comfortable where I'm at. I'm also worried that I won't be able to do some of the things that I do in AE such as syncing the clips up to the ""beats"" in the audio (as can be seen in my 3rd link). I like to have everything in one place, but I also want to do things the ""correct"" way so that I can better prepare myself for the real world.

I'm literally brand new to filming and video editing, but I'm pretty serious about this project. I just bought a Nikon D5100 and Rode Videomic, and DSLR video doesn't seem to be too different from taking DSLR stills. Most of my questions right now pertain to editing.

Unfortunately, I'm constrained to working on a Linux box for the time being. If my budget ever allows, I'll try to get a Mac, but for now I'll have to stick with open source tools. OpenShot seems like it will do most of what I need it to, but there's a problem that I'm about to encounter that I'd really like to develop an efficient pipeline for.

I need to import and overlay/composite a ton of images (jpegs, pngs, etc.) on top of the video (probably in one of the corners). I'm probably going to average ~100 images per video, so this would become a real pain to physically have to import and control the placement and timing of each. Not to mention controlling the sizing of the images.

Is there a programatic way to do this in Blender or similar software? That is, can I access an API for any of these programs and quickly set it up to overlay images at a defined position for a defined duration? If not, is there at least a way to control the position these images are imported and overlayed on? News casts tend to have a defined region for photos/images that are compositied in, and I hope some of this software does as well.

If open source tooling can't do this, do you know any commercial software that does? How ""easy"" is it to do?

I now work for a small science-education nonprofit running on a budget so we try to use open-source software.

It seems like Gimp and Inkscape are pretty standard replacements for Photoshop and Illustrator but there doesn't seem to be as much consensus about video editing. I've actually been using the free version of Microsoft Expression Encoder, which gets the job done but I feel like there has to be something better out there.

I do this on a volunteer basis and we've put a ton of time into this video. Of course tonight we go to run the DVDs off after putting in about 40 hours into this thing and the project is corrupt. Here's the story:

While working in Final Cut Pro X 10.0.0 my computer crashed and upon attempting to reopen the project was missing. When manually dragging in the project file it tells me the file is corrupt. Must've been saving or something when it crashed.

I have no backups as it appears 10.0.0 does not do this as there was no ""Backups"" folder in the project folder. 

Interventions so far:

-I deleted the 2 Final Cut Pref files.

-I duplicated the project file and attempted loading.

-I attempted to open from a different hard drive.

-I upgraded to Final Cut 10.0.6 which gives me the following message which either deletes it if I click continue or sends me back to my finder.

Anyway, I am editing a project in Premiere Pro CS6 using 3 different shots from three different cameras.  To sync them up, I used the great tool of PluralEyes.  All three shots synced perfectly, as expected.  However when bringing in exported audio from Soundtrack Pro, the audio drifts out of sync in the sequence over time.  The sample rate and bit depth of the sequence is 48 KHz, 16 Bit, as is the exported audio from STP.  The frame rates are both 29.97, NTSC.  Codec ProRes 422, 2.7k.  The audio is an AIFF Stereo file, channels 1,2.

I have tred a few tricks such as messing around with the sample rate and bit depth on export in STP, and even trying to mess around with the XML file of the STP Audio.  I have also tried using the WAVE and MP3 formats, but was still getting the sync drift.  

Finally, I tried the ""forbidden 99.9% or 100.1%"" audio speed up/slow down trick in Premiere.  Still, didn't work.  I also tried messing around with the audio in Abelton Live.  You guessed it, still drifting.  

Just to make things clear, all three camera shots remain in sync, it's the exported AIFF from STP which drifts.

TL;DR - My AIFF with the same settings as my sequence in Premiere Pro is drifting out of sync.  Multiple steps have been attempted to try to solve the issue, none of which have worked.

Any help with my situation from the community is greatly appreciated!

UPDATE: Everything is working now, here is what I did:
I exported both the original audio and the Canon audio into an MP3 file.  Yeah, I know the quality is bad, but AIFF was clearly not working.  I then brought both files into Serato, the software I use to DJ, and it turned out Serato recognize the files were .7 beats off from each other.  I synced them, recorded them, and boom, everything worked again.

I told him yes... he asked if I could deliver in 10 days... Oh boy.

The concept is simple:  

1. It's a locked off shot of the lead singer, looking right into the camera, singing the song, in one continuous take.
2. I'll shooting the entire thing at 1fps, using a stills camera.
3. I will then bring the frames into After Effects, and using Twixtor, interpolate the footage up to 30fps.  

The effect will be that the singer's mouth is in the correct position for a single frame every 1 second, but the intermediate frames are going to be interpolated... giving a drugged out slow-mo effect.  

I did a very quick and dirty test that you can see here: http://clients.davidvincentwolf.com/twixtor.mp4

My concern is syncing the audio in post... I don't want to create a nightmare for my editor. If we can get the first frame synced up, the rest of the footage should fall into place as well, because it's all one take.  

I can't envision any way to slate it... I'm wondering if I should have the artist provide a version of the track with a ""3 - 2 - 1"" intro beep before the song, so that we can have the first frame fire at the exact moment the song starts.

1363573990.0,11,self.VideoEditing,1ai23n,It seems like my rendering times in After Effects CS6 are much longer than they should be... help?,12,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1ai23n/it_seems_like_my_rendering_times_in_after_effects/,"I have some GoPro mountain biking footage that was shot at 1080p, 60fps.  It's 2 minutes and 7 seconds long.  I pulled it into After Effects and added the following effects:

* Very slight black solid fade in and fade out
* Magic Bullet Looks coloring
* 3D camera tracking with some text which affects &lt;10 seconds of the video.  I cut out that section separately so the 3D camera tracker is only affecting that section of video and not the rest
* The ""bad TV effect"" (where it looks like the video is on an old, poor quality television) which fades off at the beginning of the video then back on at the end of the video.

I also reduced some quality of the video to try to help improve the render time:

* Reduced the FPS from 60 to 30 fps
* Reduced the video size from 1080p to 720p
* Reduced the Ray Traced quality to 1
* Exported the audio to 41,000 hz
* Exported using H.264 and changed the export to a single pass instead of the multiple pass
* I've also enabled multi processor rendering and maximized the amount of memory used by After Effects

My computer specs are:

* i7 @ 2.93 ghz
* 8 gb of RAM
* ATI Radeon 5700

My render time for this video is around 8-9 hours.  What am I doing wrong here?  Is this normal?

**Edit**: Okay, so I ran some tests.  I exported a video to .AVI, then rendered that video out to uncompressed .AVI.  I then added a Magic Bullet Look to the video and tried it again.

I then loaded the same clip in .MP4, exported out to .MP4 with and without Magic Bullet Looks.

With and without the effect, I got shorter rendering times using the .MP4 files.

I went back to my composition and trimmed out all the layers which weren't affecting the whole video to only the area they were affecting and I found the culprit.  It was the 3D camera layer.  I had cut out the section of video I wanted affected by the 3D camera tracker so it wouldn't affect the rest of the video, but After Effects applied the camera layer to the entire 2 minutes of video.  Once I trimmed that down so it was only on the few seconds of video I had 3D text in, my rendering time shrunk to ~1 hour.  I saw further improvement when I trimmed the ""bad tv"" look so the layers were only present on the sections of video where the effect's opacity was &gt;0%.

I know an hour of rendering time is still a bit long, but hey, compared to 9 or so hours, I'll take it.  Plus, it's made working with the footage much, much faster.

At my current job I've been recently given the task of making a few videos that highlight certain parts of a website. So basically the website will scroll from top to bottom or w/e and certain bits of the site will pop out and some text will come out, highlighting what the bit that popped out is.

This is all fine, and I know enough to be able to do what they want me to. The only problem right now is, since the video is supposed to highlight quite a number of things, my main composition is now filled with a ton of keyframes on different layers and pre-comps. If I'm asked to make a small change like ""make this part last 1 second longer"" or ""can you add this extra bit in between this and that?"", it seems to me as if it would require me to move a ton of keyframes on all the layers or it'll end up messing up the timing of everything else in the video.

This is the closest to my problem that I have found on forums, and it remains unsolved. I am using CS4.

I have a 2 minute Premiere project which has a lot of different videos in the sequence. I have to do color correction and other adjustments to most of the clips, so my method was: in Project1.prproj, I would right click on video1, replace with AE composition, do my job in AE, save AE project as Comp1.aep. For video2, I would go to Project1.prproj, save it as Project2.prproj, do the replace thing, do the work in AE, save as Comp2.aep. So on and so forth, until I'm about at Project10.pr, and suddenly video9, video8, video6 have been replaced by Comp10, video7 is offline, video5 and video4 are hatched/hachured(whatever that word is) and parts of them don't even have a line above them at all (like the green line when a video is rendered, or a red one when it's not). Some videos are completely offline.

So I try every way I can think of to re-link these files, given my cautious saving of the projects. The problem is the same with ALL saved projects, not jus Project10.prproj, it goes back to Project1.prproj. I manage to salvage some videos from the AE auto-saved projects, and import them into a fresh sequence in a fresh Premiere project, but most of them still show up as Comp10! 

I tried re-importing the sequence from Project10 into a brand new Premiere project, did not solve the issue. I then imported the sequence with the salvaged files, tried to insert the usable ones over the damaged videos in the imported Project10 sequence, and Premiere just freezes. It seems like anything I try now, Premiere just dies and is  not responding.

I finally gave up and went into After Effects (having previously tried to export each Comp as a Premiere Project, which didn't work), and I exported Comp10 as a .mov and as a .hd-stream-thingy. Made another new Premiere Project, tried importing either the .mov or .hd, it freezes and is not responding. 

Otherwise, Premiere works, just not on any projects that have anything to do with the problem videos, comps or prprojs. 

I am at my wit's end, and I don't want to accept that I'll lose about 20 hours of work like this, and have to do it all again from scratch.

Okay here's roughly where I am.

Unsure about the monitor, looking at getting something nicer like a yamakasi catleap. Worried that it might not be compatible with the graphics card I end up with. Or even that it might not work with a 2 monitor setup (If I decide to do that later on).

Do I need more wattage on the PSU? I think it depends on the graphics card right? 

Please help me find a nice graphics cards, I'm really struggling trying to figure out what would be best. Not sure if Radeon is simply incompatible  because of driver issues and CUDA issues. Also I have been looking at GTX 580s and GTX 680s (also 570s and 670s) but it seems like the 680s are better for gaming, worse for editing. What about if I go with one that has 3 or 4 gb on it? would that cancel out the problems somewhat?

Just switching to PC so I'm planning on editing on Premiere or Avid (not sure which I'll like better.) I like to play high end fast paced FPSs and would like to gear the gaming side of the comp to that.

Constructive criticism is more than welcome!,7,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1jaqpy/decided_to_make_a_new_intro_for_my_videos_what_do/,"So my original intro was getting old to me and I wanted to make it more eye-catching, flashy, graphically better, and themed for the new wave of videos I'm going to be producing with my newly learned skills. So I did.

It all started with [This ""Slothcano"" font style](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1vPEUbjtaoQ/UenoA44mmWI/AAAAAAABxjE/cH3GGfxcVdM/w500/c2maZJO.jpg) created by /u/BigMP.

I really thought it just popped out so I messaged him and asked if I could use it for an intro and he was perfectly fine with it and told me the basics on how to make it.

I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like. It took a good amount of looking for the perfect sounds and effects but it finally came together nicely (IMO).

I'll explain my simple process. (I know it could be better but be nice lol. My girl was getting bored while I was throwing this together.) It was made entirely using only Photoshop and Sony Vegas.

1. I started with a good [background image](http://imgur.com/a/JdesE#0) from a post I saved a while back.
2. Made a similar font and effect in photoshop. Split it up into 2 images because it's 2 words. Added blue background for blue screening.
3. Decided about 6 seconds is a good length for this intro
4. Decided I wanted the theme to make it feel as if you were at a ""scrapyard"", ""car garage"", and in a ""blacksmith worksop""
5. Found a standard [steel pattern](http://aluminumstock.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/aluminum-diamond-plate.jpg) and overlaid it on top of the BG image at about a 2% opacity.
6. Used an continuous, black-screened fire with the opacity around 5% above the image which came from [Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net).
7. Used smoke effects to the left and right of the video via [Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net) as well at around a 5% opacity.
8. Used [NewBlue](http://newbluefx.com) transitions in Vegas for when the text goes in and out.
9. Faded in the beginning and faded out the end
10. Rendered it in 1080p and put it back into the timeline
11. Then I added added sound effects (these were hard to find and i had to edit them to make them sound like I wanted)
 - Constant background noise of machinery drilling
 - Hammer hitting and anvil for when the text ""hits"" the screen (found and edited the sounds from a Lord Of The Rings: Making of the weapons YouTube Video)
 - The sound the drill makes when it takes bolts off a tire (found and edited the sound from a nascar YouTube video)
 - Added a crackling fireplace sound effect to go along with the ""blacksmith"" theme.
12. Next I took the video and used keyframes and cropping to twist and zoom so the smoke, fire, and text all stayed in place rather than twist and zoom each one individually. (It's the lazy way which is why i rendered and added it back in the timeline, potentially lowering the quality)
13. Added slight ""Film"" FX to make it look like it came off a film roll.
14. Manually darkened corners with a filter and blurred them in to make it less noticeable in a newly created top layer to the timeline

15. Re-rendered and [THIS IS THE FINAL OUTCOME](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVVqNYVUPXY). Check it out in 1080p.

Thanks for reading and watching and I'd appreciate any feedback, negative or positive.

I'm working towards making a youtube channel for my music and wanted to make some simple, yet visually appealing music videos to play along with my music. I will be doing all of the recording myself, but will need somebody to do some mild editing, color correction, and maybe a few simple effects.

I'd like to try and bring someone onboard before I actually shoot so there could be some dialogue about what shots would be preferred. As far as the shooting itself is concerened, they will most likely all be still shots (with an HD camera, albeit not an expensive one). Here are some references for the type of videos I'd like to be making:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2RA0vsZXf8

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkHJ2-zoSB4

I will be paying for this, but I'm not exactly sure what a fair price would be. I was hoping for around a $100-$150 cost per video (likely to be three videos within the next few months).  I'd be willing to go a little higher possibly if that's what a fair price would be.

Also, I've done some work with videos in high school, so I should be at least mildly knowledgable about what's going on, and the general process. I hope this was the right subreddit - if not, if you could kindly point me to right one, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks!

I've been seeing an issue in my videos recently that didn't used to be present. I'll give two examples:

In the first video, which I just rendered, every time I move or turn, you can see that the video distorts when I'm moving, but then snaps back to high quality when I stop:

[Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENiRA79pEo)

In the second video, an older one, You can see that while the issue is still present, it is not NEARLY as bad or noticable, and it ""catches up"" much faster. It doesn't ""snap"" from bad to good:

[Video 2 - Start at 9:50 and watch for about 20-30 seconds](http://youtu.be/VQKiUvC660Q?t=9m50s)

What I've done to alleviate this problem at least a little is I have started doing a two pass when I render. It helps clear the issue up, but it can double to quadruple my rendering time. That is the big issue.

So the big questions: Does anyone know the correct term for this distortion? And is there a way to alleviate it?

I'm helping a friend burn some subtitles into some XviD-encoded AVI files.

Can anyone suggest anything (a different codec? that doesn't make sense,) that might keep me closer to the image quality of the original .avi? I've tried cranking the quality settings of the DivX codec to maximum, but I'm still getting significantly increased blocky artifacts.

His application requires that he burn the subs rather than use a subtitle track in an .mkv file.

I haven't turned to Reddit for much advice yet. Direct me in the correct subreddit if this is wrong. Thanks for understanding.

So. I have about 500 GB of about 120 events. Each individual event is ~3-4 GB, some being a bit larger. These events were filmed with PivotHead glasses, receiving each video in 720p 29.97 fps, and when I play the unedited version the event plays in full screen. Some of my events were cut into multiple files, and this doesn't work with my job's website, so I have to merge and compress each event into 800-1200 MB .mp4's.

I figured this process out myself using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and Adobe Media Encoder CS6, not too difficult. My only question comes with the formatting of the video output.

What format should I choose? Most likely it would be a custom format, but I'm looking for some direction in determining this. I have been using Vimeo SD 29.97, because the compression size is adequate, but it creates a black frame around the top and bottom of the video. I have dabbled with Android Tablet 720p 29.97 as the size is a little smaller and the frame is full, but the time taken to complete the compression is significantly greater. Quality isn't the biggest concern here, though it obviously factors into the importance. Video needs to be visible, but not HD. If someone could with greater video editing knowledge could shed some light, I would be very grateful.

VideoPad does what I need but has one tragic flaw which triples the amount of time it takes me to get any work done (besides only using one core - it's free so i can't complain).

the three basic buttons for setting a start point end point then copying and pasting that selected footage from to your storyboard works as follows;

#Ctrl + . : Set input point here
#Ctrl + , : Set output point here
#Ctrl + e : Add clip to sequence

so I should be able in the Selected File Preview window to set the input output then add the clip to the end of my storyboard sequence, then move or reset to a new input and output point and add the next clip, etc.  *there is a setting (by default) where it automatically adds new clips to the end of your storyboard sequence, so there is no need to mouse around to position it and set a new storyboard endpoint.*

only in VideoPad it does not allow me to work this way.

what VideoPad does is after I add a clip it greys out the Add clip command and button, so when i choose a new input and output point, i can't Add that new clip - even drag and drop does not work to Add anything from the preview to the storyboard.  what I'm forced to do is reselect the original file so it appears fresh in my preview window, then i have to hunt through an hour of video to find the area of the file i left off and only then can i designate a new input output point so the Add button is active again.

i imagine there must be a way to clear/reset the input:output points so the Add clip button refreshes and comes back ready for your next clip selection - but the only way to clear/reset those input:output points that I can find is to reload the original video file all over again into the preview window.

this is truly frustrating.  why would anyone design a program that makes you start all over again to simply get to your next area for clip selection.  I can only assume there is some setting or usage finesse I may not be familiar with, so maybe someone who uses VideoPad regularly can enlighten me.  they don't host a forum, and tech support is only for paid versions, so I'm hoping someone here can help me out.

Imagine you were word processing a 100 page contract and every time you cut&amp;pasted a paragraph to a new area, you had to save, reload then scroll through many pages to find where you where you last left off - nobody would buy such a program, yet that's exactly how VideoPad seems to work.",,False,,t5_2ri0h,1366209537.0,,,True,t3_1cj4j3,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1cj4j3/videopad_video_editor_a_basic_user_question/,

I've been editing on the following system for about a year and a half now.  Lately, my Mac has been getting slower and slower, w/ the rainbow Mac wheel spinning more and more.  I go into activity manager and kill unneeded apps, but essentially, Premiere is the biggest hog, followed by Outlook and Chrome and I can't close that since I'm editing in it (currently, it's using 4.19 GB of memory).
Before I go and get more RAM, I'm wondering if my workflow is the issue at hand.

Basically, I shoot everything on a Canon XF 105 (always in 1080p) and save to CF Cards.  Once I'm finished, I go to the file folders and manually pull over the MXF files onto my hard drive.  From there, I create regular folders for the footage and then I go into Premiere and just pull the files into the program.  Then I edit, export and repeat &amp; rinse…over and over. 

Here's a snapshot of my system:
Mac Pro
Mid 2010
Processor  2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon
Memory  8 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 ECC
Graphics  ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB
Software  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63b)

FireWire Disk 3.61 TB Free out of 6 TB

500 GB
Flash Storage: 2.33.38 GB Free out of 499.42 GB

2 TB
RAID Storage:  18.98 free out of 2TB

As noted, I'm using Premiere CS5.5

My question is:  Is there anything I can change in my workflow that will help speed things up or should I just get 8 more gigs of RAM?

Hello there. I've recently undertaken the task of converting a load of old family home movies on 8mm film to digital. For this task I used my Canon HF100 digital camcorder, which shoots high definition in .m2ts format, otherwise known as AVCHD.

I shot them in the highest resolution, and all together the video files now add up to over 12gb.

Now I wish to burn them to DVD, but of course even DL DVD's aren't of a large enough capacity to store 12gb, so I now have the problem of how to compress the files.

My question, then, is what freely available software is out there that will do this, or alternatively convert them to an easier format to handle such as avi or mkv?

Finally, what is the best freeware/shareware programme out there to edit and create a DVD with menues that will play on a standard DVD player? Now obviously, it has to support .m2ts format.

1353381093.0,5,self.VideoEditing,13hlxm,"Premiere Pro vs Premiere Elements for basic, journalistic editing",6,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/13hlxm/premiere_pro_vs_premiere_elements_for_basic/,"I'm a photojournalist, and I'm looking for some light but fast and powerful video editing software. 

In the past, I've used Adobe Premiere CS5 for editing, but I think it's a bit heavy to put on my editing laptop, so I've only got it on my desktop. This  limits my editing abilities, since I have to be tied down to edit. Also, I'm kind of ashamed to say that I don't own Premiere Pro, and I would like to actually buy some video editing software. 

I'm pretty well bought into Adobe as a brand. I'm a user of Lightroom and Photoshop. I've used Premiere before. I'd like to stay in that universe. 

**SO HERE IS MY QUESTION,** now that I've gotten the basics of my situation out of the way:

Should I fork over the money for Premiere CS6 or whatever the newest version is, or should I go for Elements? Here's the features I would like/need: 

* Basic editing of 1080p 30fps frames from my Canon 5Dmk2, 60D and GoPro all in one project. 

* Audio syncing. I like to record external audio on my Zoom H1. I don't care if I have to sync it manually, I would just like the ability to sync it and have a finer control of audio. 

* Basic color correcting. I'm used to manually setting White Balance and watching it, but the ability to correct a bit of WB in post would be nice. Also, a minute amount of contrast added. I don't want to do major filters or huge cinema style color correcting jobs, I just want things to line up and be pretty unified in a journalistic way. 

* With my experience with photo editing, it would be nice to have something that allows sequences to be played without some long render time. I like to adjust-look-adjust-look and so on. 

* Fine control over where effects like visual/audio fades start and end, how long they are, etc.  

I know the premiere I had can do all of this, but I want to know if I have to spend a whole lot to get those features, or if I could be fine with the much cheaper version. 

Here's the setup I'm running: Dell XPS 13"" 128GB solid State hard drive (I don't store any files on the computer. It's purely editing) Windows 8 64 bit, 4GB ram i7 processor. It can whip through large photos with ease, so I'm pretty sure it could handle either software package. With the 128GB SSD, I'm very wary of how much space things take up, though, so I would like the lighter/cheaper elements if possible. 

[Here's a video I did on Premiere. It uses just about all of the features I would need in a video editing software package.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIqlCD10e8I)

**TL;DR** Will Elements work for me, or do I have have to go pro?

I've used tons of programs and I  love Windows Movie Maker to death (no hate please).  In many areas, it would be my editing program of choice.  I can even put up with the constant crashes.

Basically: need something that can import and export HD file formats and keeps my video quality.

One of the things I love about WMM's simplicity is that it's so easy to write custom .xml's and BAM, new effects and transitions.  I would really enjoy having a program where its easy to make custom effects/easy to obtain effects for free/at little cost.

Cost.. The thing that limits my options most! Sigh. I'm looking for a program around $100, but will definitely still look at good suggestions a bit over that.  I make videos for myself, but I have been entering festivals, and in general, I want the best quality I can afford.

I know I had more things to say, but I can never remember everything at once! Will try to update later

**TL;DR:  Under $100, can edit and export HD files in great quality, possibility to obtain custom effects**

This combo works well for these sports as it's waterproof/tough/fast/small... the Gopro gives good fish-eye footage, and the TS3 allows more normal footage for faces and has a zoom.

But: I had noticed that the *source* files look great, but while *editing* the TS3 clips often looked ***blurry*** on the moving figures... 

Eventually I worked out that if I went into the timeline Properties of each TS3 clip and changed ""Smart Resample"" to ""Disable Resample"" the blurriness instantly disappeared ([Here's two comparative screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/RZDzB))... but I have no idea why!

1. What is happening?! 
1. Is there a downside to this?
1. Can/should my workflow be altered? (below)

My PAL workflow (Sony Vegas Movie Studio 11) is:

1. Shoot GoPro at 1280x720-25fps, MPEG4 h.264 (the majority of my footage).
1. Shoot TS3 at 1280x720-50fps, AVCHD (50fps is the lowest possible).
1. Select project properties to match the GoPro footage, ie 1280x720-25fps.
1. Drop everything into timeline (it is here that the TS3 footage becomes blurry).
1. Go to each TS3 clip and ""disable resampling"". (blurriness disappears)
1. Edit.
1. Export finished video in ""Sony AVC/MVC (*.mp4;*.m2ts;*.avc) -- ""Internet 1280x720-25p"" "".
1. Upload to YouTube.

It works fine now but it's inconvenient to change the properties of each individual clip for a third of every project!

So *any* info/advice/help much appreciated!

At work we use iMovie for editing our covert videos on investigations and we include a Date and Time stamp onto every clip. The Camera time is set properly, the Mac's time is set properly, and the clip in iMovie shows the correct time header when viewing next to the event library, but once the clip is dragged into the Project library and a Date and Time stamp is put onto it, the time is off by 5 hours. It is consistently 5 hours on every Date and Time stamp.

The only work around we have right now is to go in and edit the actual clip time and remove 5 hours, that way the Date and Time stamp adding 5 hours shows the correct time.

I go through each file and chop every file down to the pieces I can use in a final video.

Now, I lay them all in the order I want them in for the final video.

Let's say everything together is about 10 minutes.

I then start playing with the usual slow-motion or fast forward, and some video transitions.   Then, I do some color adjustments.

Now, I have what seems to be my final video.   So now the video is about 9 minutes long or something.   I go and I look for a song that is about 9 minutes long.

But then... there's the problem.    Obviously all the transitions and such are not matched to the beats of the music.   So I end up truncating and changing speeds of some clips to try to match things up.

I had a lot of mixed thoughts while putting together shots and had a bazillion transitions with a ton of short shots but that ended up seeming odd and tacky and I preferred the slightly faster pace that hard cuts seemed to add while including longer dedicated shots  -because it felt like each shot had more context and reason to be there the longer it was on screen.- It was also as if the dissolves and fades slowed the whole thing down and the cuts made it faster...
  
But, I need you advice, I feel like this video is total crap and it probably is. The point was to make a ""fun"" road trip video. The same way a song will make your head bop was how I wanted the viewer to say to themselves, ""well that seemed pretty cool"". I am not one for big productions and ""Oh my god!"" sort of things....  
  
So, tell me, what shots worked well? Which shots were too short, too long? What can I work on in terms of transitions and compiling different shots together? What sorts of things should I include/not include in a video like this? What sorts of editing am I missing in this video that I should consider so as to improve it?
  
I have about 8-9 hours of video from the trip, a lot of it shakey, or not to useful. I could probably make a 10 minute video of every ""good"" shot, but I just don't know how to fit shots together. I ordered the book [In The Blink Of An Eye](http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Eye-Revised-2nd-Edition/dp/1879505622), and I am dedicating my evenings to learning film making and editing. I have Sony Vegas as my program, and the camcorder I am using is a [Canon Vixia HF G10](http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/camcorders/consumer_camcorders/vixia_hf_g10).

Any help, advice, or criticism is appreciated. And I plan and assume it will take me at least 2-3 more attempts to make a decent video for the trip, this will not be my last valiant effort.

I have a team mate of mine working with me and we need to access the same file in order to make the entire animation on one file to avoid compression. Is there a way we can both work on the file at the same time? A better question is, is there a way we can work on different after effects project files and then import certain compositions into one master file later?

The company I'm employed at is making the switch to Premiere, so that's where my focus has been lately.

   I'm looking to diversify my skills, and I've always been interested in motion/effects/graphics so I've decided to start learning Adobe After Effects. I have a login to lynda.com provided by my employer, so I'm planning on using that as a resource for my initial training. I don't have the exercise files, but I figure I may be able to find a torrent somewhere online. If not, it may be worth my own personal investment. Does anyone have experience with the Lynda.com After Effects training?

Aside from this, does anyone have any suggestions for solid training resources, or particular aspects of AE I should learn first to build foundational skills? 

To provide a brief self portrait: I've been playing music for about a decade, been writing poetry and creative pieces for about just as long. I have a BA in Creative Writing and about 3 years of video production experience. For the past 18 months I've been studying French and Attic Greek. I feel that my lifestyle provides a propensity for creative, analytical modes of thought that would be conducive to learning programs like AE. Am I right in thinking this way, or am I engaging with an entirely different beast?

How many hours should I expect to put in before I could work on projects at a professional level? In my mind I'm expecting 3-6 months of independent practice before I'll be able to impress my coworkers/employers.

I am currently using a 5D mkii and was wondering what software you would recommend. Should I get FCPX, Avid, or Premiere. I'd like something that is compatible with the native codec of the 5D and can work with Adobe AE. Also, I am shooting audio separately and heard some bad things about FCPX along those lines. One final question, how do you suggest I color correct stuff- with the editor I am using or another application? I am looking for something able to work well for shorts and potentially feature-length stuff. Also, I'd like something that can use all my imac's RAM and processing power. I might put some shorts on the web, but I'd also need to make DVDs and Blu-rays of whatever I make.

EDIT: Thanks for all your responses! I think I'm going to do trials of both Premiere and Avid before deciding. I was hoping FCPX would improve, but so far, it looks like not much has changed.

Adobe Flash Video

MPEG

AVCHD

AVI

Windows Media

QuickTime

The other two options are for image and audio, which I will not be using. Anyway, which one of these should I use? Is there any way I can export without compressing, and then put it in to virtualdub?

from this url
http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/295757-Cutting-x264-Video-Files

You've got a mess on your hands. The x264 format does not lend itself well to direct editing, due to its compression scheme. You should first convert your flv videos (or whatever source) to an intermediate format that most editing software can handle -- like DV-AVI (frame accurate). Once you are finished editing, you convert to x264 or whatever format floats your boat. 



So in answer, I probably have to do a full processing mode in vdubmod to this format, then edit, then recompress... ughhh.

My feeling that he didn't really understand the question, and his vested interest has me not accepting his advice at face value.

This machine won't really need to do much rendering - college machines will handle long exports - this is just for timeline editing, etc.

How performant should I expect such a machine to be with FCPX?  Like I say, little to no rendering, I'm just asking about UI responsiveness, and so on, on that bottom end Macbook.

Thanks.

I primarily use Premiere Pro CS6 for video editing. I know how to use after effects to make animated titles and such, but am not too proficient in it yet. 

I'm pretty sure these videos were done mainly in after effects, but can anyone point me in the right direction to be able to achieve something similar? (i.e. seamlessly superimpose animated characters and effects into videos). What features/tools of after effects should I learn about and are there any plugins etc that would be required?

Edit: What I'm most curious about is how the editor was able to have the blanka (in the 1st video) appear and move behind specific things/people but not others.

I had some questions that Google or other Reddit threads couldn't answer and I was hoping you guys could be of some assistance.


**Copyrighted Music**

I'm aware of the [numerous sites that provide copyright-free/creative common music](http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1fp9st/where_can_i_find_legal_music_to_play_for/cachmg2) but what if a client *wants* to use copyrighted music?  Does purchasing it from iTunes grant me the right to use that song?  Or do I have to actually go through the record-label and purchase rights?

**Contracts**

I am also aware of the numerous [sites dedicated to helping freelancers with contracts](https://www.freelancersunion.org/contract-creator/) but I couldn't find anything dedicated solely to video editors.

I guess my question is how do I protect myself using a medium where virtually anyone can stick their head into frame?  What can I do to protect myself from Uncle Photobomb who comes back saying he didn't give permission for the client or myself to use his likeness?

Does writing something as simple as, ""You agree that everyone who appears in the final cut has given permission to use their likeness"", in a contract actually work?  I once tried to submit something to America's Funniest Home Videos and their submission contract needed signatures from *everyone* who appeared in the clip...physically appeared or even just their voice.

**Formatting and Exporting**

If a client provides video files that need converting or capturing in order for me to use in iMovie '11, do I charge for the time it takes to convert/capture those files?  Or do I tell them, ""Hey, I need your files in this format; you figure it out""?  Or give them both options?  I assume Handbrake is my friend for these situations...?

And in regards to exporting the final product, what's the norm?  Do you normally provide them with numerous levels of resolution (480, 720, 1080)?  Or do you only give them what they ask for and charge them for extra time if they need it in lower or higher resolution?

Sorry for the randomness of these questions but it's literally how my checklist looks right now.  I'm just starting-out and brainstorming and coming up with questions/scenarios I should probably tackle now instead of later.",,False,,t5_2ri0h,False,,,True,t3_1fqhta,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1fqhta/some_questions_about_freelance_videoediting/,

 I'm attempting to build multiple different DVD Images (or discs) from different timelines in a single Encore project. That could look like:

Timeline 1: Standard edit
Timeline 2: Subtitles
Timeline 3: Extended cut
etc, etc. 

Now when I want to build a dvd image, I don't see an option to select a single timeline; I can only choose the entire project, or a pre-existing disc image. This presents the obvious problem where I'd have to continuously delete my timelines in order to have them not show-up on every dvd image. Or, I'd have to create multiple encore projects, which isn't ideal. 

If Premiere can allow you to export single sequences, why can't encore build single timelines?

I make a series of YouTube tutorials for a video game (University of Trials http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUY2xbFy6PU) and as part of the series, I provide gameplay and a voice-over.  I do the gameplay first then roughly edit the footage, then record the VO. Now at various points, to emphasize a important topic, I will pause the in-game footage while i continue to talk. To do this currently, I pause the comp, take a still shot. cut the video at that frame, import and insert the still back into the comp for the duration of the 'pause' then continue the clip. 

If there was some faster way to hold the frame (I mention that because I have even seen that options somewhere???) so that for X amount of frames, I could keyframe a 0% speed or something? I'm totally self taught so have never found a tutorial for this. 

As a bonus, can I use keyframes to alter speed in general so that I could gradually go from 20% to 100% rather than a straight cut and changing the speed settings of each clip?

I don't plan on doing crazy special effects, but I would like to do the following:

* Trim timeouts, time between whistles, etc... from the final product
*  Be able to put a text overlay for penalties and scores
*  Be able to upload to Youtube with 1-click (or export it to a file format that I can easily upload through Youtube's website)

I have an 5 year old computer that I think will meet the minimum requirements and I know it may a slow process.

My main question is:  What program should I get?  I would prefer freeware.  I looked at the beginner's guide and it mentioned Windows Movie Maker and EZvid, both of which look relatively simple.

But you are the experts...  Should I continue down the path of WMM and EZvid or is there something else I should look at?

I'm new to the world of editing but I'm trying to refine my skill so I just installed Avid on my home computer and wanted to work on a school project at home. All of my footage and SFX are saved on the same external HD. After setting up my home computer with the same settings as those I was using at school (I think anyways...), I get ""Media Offline"" over all of the footage I shot. All of my SFX work properly along with any of the footage in my timeline that needed to render. 

As I said, I'm very new to this, but I imagine this has something to do with linking to the proper AMA (if someone could provide and explain it to me like I'm 5 they would get extra points here)? One thing I'm worried about is that in order to organize my bins of footage, I did something that might make it difficult to re-link the footage. I'm going to try my best to describe how I organized things here:

I originally shot ~ 4, 8 gig SxS cards of footage and imported each of those cards into their own bin in Avid. Then, after labeling each take with it's scene number, I created individual bins for each scene. Then I clicked and dragged these shots out of their original bins and into their proper ""scene bin"" so that I could quickly find each scene. This means that each of these scene bins contains a random assortment of of shots from each of the four original bins as they are actually saved on the external HD. Is there an easy way to still link all this media to the proper place?

I figured maybe it was just a problem with my computer going into sleep mode, so I went to re-render it, and it got stuck on the exact same part. Turns out 73% through the video is the exact point where that clip is. I fiddled around a little bit, and decided to try trimming down the clip from its original video in a separate project, then rendering that short clip as WMV, and finally only *then* putting it in the LP project. It seemed to work fine, but when I get to that part of the video while previewing, Vegas hangs and says ""Not Responding,"" even though playing the clip in VLC works perfectly fine.

We recorded the footage off of two cameras, a stationary one (call it A) and a handheld (call it B).  We also recorded audio from the mixing board.

So the idea is to make a decent video of the whole concert, by taking footage from both cameras and using the audio from the soundboard.  Camera A would provide most of the footage, since it was stationary and captured the whole concert, but that footage would be peppered with the more dynamic, up close shots from Camera B.

The problem is that the audio of the soundboard doesn't stay synced with the video footage from camera A.  At the beginning of the concert, I synced the two perfectly.  You can see the drummer hit the snare, for example, and hear the snare from the audio.  Perfectly.   But by the end of the show, the video and audio are completely off.  You'll hear a snare hit while the drummer's arm is still in the air.  

I am a total amateur.  This is the first time I've done any video editing whatsoever, and I have no idea what I could be doing wrong.  I figure I must have some settings messed up, where the audio's bitrate and the video's framerate are just slightly off from each other so that Premiere plays them back at slightly different speeds.  It's the only thing I can think of, but I have no idea how to prove this is what's happening, much less how to fix it.

What's worse is that I had already done a BUNCH of multi-camera editing, jumping back and forth from camera a to b, before I noticed the issue.  so ideally I'd love to have a solution where I don't have to start over from scratch...but I understand that may be asking too much.

Could anyone help me out? I am a budding musician looking to do some ""one-man band"" projects over break to get some good practice in, and I am looking for a way to combine two or more video files via split-screen, and also combine their audio.

[Something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYBxowu4U64&amp;list=PLACFB636E06EF79CC&amp;index=8) is what I would like to end up with for the end result (skip to any part beyond the first fifteen seconds or so).

There was a [download I found on google](http://www.rehanfx.org/split_video.htm) that would supposedly allow me to do this in windows movie maker, but upon trying it I found that it was rather glitchy, and also would only allow the combining of two clips. I might need to combine 3 or more.

I am by no means an amateur editor or anything, so I'm hoping that there's some sort of freeware out there I can use to do this! I am primarily a musician and a graphic designer, so it would not be a good use of money for me to invest in expensive video-editing software.


The extent of editing I'll need to do is crop a few seconds off of the beginning/end of clips and string some clips together to improvise a beat (again, see example video).

Of course, I could do all this much more easily using a MIDI keyboard and audio software, but this way would be a lot more personal and fun.

Personally, I am a beginner editor at a medium sized A/V company in Australia and have used both Avid MC and FCPX, and I have to say that I love FCPX a lot more than AVID and at this stage it is purely just because of ease of use and GUI. In saying this, AVID does have it's place for sure, but I have only worked on a small number of projects, so my mind may change. At this stage I'm looking to have a handle on all of the editing programs.

Having just cut my entire first project in Avid MC and then going to FCPX I am stuck wishing I used FCPX. I just took Apple's three day FCPX course to learn all the basics about the programs and to keep it simple, the design, overall aspect of cutting, sliding, rolling and general editing seems to be a lot easier. Now, as I am a beginner editor I haven't started to venture into multicam edits, using after effects/motion or many different formats of footage.

So I want to hear what you think!

Of course using any one of these programs is personal preference, but I want to know in terms of raw performance and pure power of the program as well.

I've watched the Videocopilot tutorials and practiced all the effects… I feel I have a good preliminary grasp on basic keyframes/masking/tracking/3D etc, but before I start trying to work on my *real* projects, I'd like to know how to be efficient from that point, and how *others* work…

Do you bring one video section in, manipulate, render, then put that back into the larger project? Or something else entirely?!

I'm using Vegas Movie Studio for my editor (PC). I want to do a few more things that my editor doesn't do well… masking/tracking in particular.

Eg: within a larger project, for a few shots I'd like to put some smoke onto a distant city (like it's destroyed).

I'm thinkng I'll:

* Edit in Vegas as usual.
* Work out what clip needs the smoke.
* Take that clip and open it with AE.
* Track Motion on the city, apply to a null-object
* Add a smoke video (from Action Essentials 2) to the composition.
* Parent the smoke to the null object. (scale, and mess around a little with feather-masking the bottom bit etc maybe)
* Render.
* Take the render result and put it back into the larger project in Vegas.

Does this sound about right?

It seems somewhat complicated, say if I wanted to have 30 shots that needed AE work I'd have a lot of different compositions…?

I'm also worried it will lose quality in there somewhere?

That's my main question! Here's some minor ones I jotted down while doing tutorials and googling…

* Audio?! All the AE tutorials ignored audio, and only briefly mentioned it once as ""I don't do audio in AE""… I have AVCHD files which I'd have to tweak to get working, or do most people just re-sync the audio-track once back in the editor? Other?!
* Do people commonly work with multiple composition tabs? I've only really worked with one so far, wondering if it's something important to learn at this stage?
* The [tuts recommended Rendering to quicktime](http://www.videocopilot.net/blog/2007/06/which-render-settings/)? I don't know much about formats, but I've always stuck to H.264 before now... thoughts? Obviously it depends on the situation, but I'm a little lost!... again, I'm on a PC, working with Vegas, source-files mainly a mix of MP4 and AVCHD (sometimes a few Quicktime FX), and my end product is for YouTube.

I'm fairly new to editing, and have been creating a short for a media studies class project. in this i need to do a particular shot that involves combining (right terminology?) several shots with the exact same backdrop/scene (used a tripod) over each other, with all being visible at once. if that's confusing (probably was, sorry)the shots have to be combined are:

1. shot one: man walks down corridor. as he passes a doorway, a figure leans out to watch him, before going back in. man goes into door at end of corridor.

2. shot 2: no man this time, figure leans out of other doorway than before.

3.shot 3: same as shot 2, different doorway this time.

put on top of each other, it should look something like this:

man walks down corridor. as he passes a doorway, a figure leans out to watch him, before going back in. this happens with two other doorways as he passes them. man goes into door at end of corridor.

so that's what i have to create. unfortunately, after messing around with premiere pro (cs6) for a while I've realised i ave no idea how to do this. messing with the opacity just makes the man transparent as he walks down the corridor, before disappearing as the second shot begins to play...I really need help with this. if it still isn't clear what i mean, please ask...thanks.",,False,,t5_2ri0h,False,,,True,t3_11cxyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/11cxyy/need_help_with_editing_a_shot_in_premiere_pro/,

I think the absolute crudest solution would be to have her computer stream out the cam and gameplay on two seperate Skype calls using a virtual camera.  I'm not even sure that would work, but would rather not have to go with such an ugly solution.

For the past couple years I've been trying to research how to put together a decent video editing machine to make some home movies of scuba diving/surfing/my bands/adventures/etc. using good but relatively basic cameras that are surely sold by the thousands every day at Best Buy around the globe.  I'm afraid to pull the trigger and invest on a home build that seems legit if it may not really hack it when I dig into anything remotely complex.

The following is a draft PC build.  Will this (or something similar) make me a happy as a beginner in video editing?  How far could this build take someone?  Are there any tweaks that would improve this while keeping the cost in this general ballpark?

* **OS:** Due to the nature of my career/industry, I'll need to stick with a PC.  Windows 7 will likely be the choice.

* **CPU:** [AMD Phenom II x6 1090t](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=phenom+ii+x6+1090t&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsr&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1040&amp;bih=668&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=17156787252500768985&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XA-7T-P8PIak8QTly_y-Cg&amp;ved=0CHQQxBUwAA) - 3.2 GHz, 6 cores, socket AM3

* **Mobo:** Something that lends itself useful for potential upgrades - i.e. I've read that a socket AM3+ is backwards compatible with the AM3 processor above, max 32 GB RAM, two PCIe x16 slots for a possible dual video card upgrade + an appropriate assortment of PCI x1 / old PCI for use with expansion cards I already have laying around.

* **Memory:** Starting with 8 gigs, or possibly 16 gigs (potentially enough to run a RAM drive?)

* **Storage:** 2 Western Digital 7200 rpm hard drives running together as Raid 0, with additional hard drives I have laying around as slave storage/backup (for now)

* **Video card:** [EVGA GTX 550 Ti](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=41125&amp;Sku=E145-0550), 1 GB onboard memory - Not sure if this is the best choice, but it seems to be a decent price (≈$120) and is always on sale these days.  Could a smaller card suffice to begin with - anything to pull the video burden off of the CPU?

* **Monitor:** Will any old VGA monitor work for now (more future birthday/hanukkah upgrades to myself) or is this another serious consideration that will need to be planned for immediately?

* **NLE:** I'm up for anything.  I've heard that Sony Vegas relies more on a processor, and Adobe Premiere needs more video card power.

I find that one of the most annoying aspects of YouTube is the very beginning and end of sports/action/how to videos when someone is fiddling with the camera to turn it on and off.  This tells me that the video quality is easily attainable, but the equipment that is necessary to handle even simple editing dwarfs the initial investment in camera - often hindering the full potential of the investment altogether.

So I've been getting a bunch of 720p 60fps footage. 99% of my projects have been 24p so getting my sequence settings correct was really quite easy. But I'm noticing some odd things with 60fps. And I'm just trying to find the optimal work flow to be able to handle the footage at normal speed and to be able to slow it down, on the same timeline with minimal rendering.

So here's sort of what I've been doing thus far...
1) Run the original clip through Compressor -&gt; keep the frame rate, size and everything the same...just running it through this to get it from H.264 to Apple Pro Res HQ.

2) Using this clip immediately in FCP seems to not produce true slow motion...despite what I set my sequence at or actually changing the speed of the clip. So from here I've been....

3) Running the new clip through Cinema Tools to conform it to 24p. This has no overwritten my old clip...so now I....

4) Start a new Sequence....drop the clip in and select YES when it asks if I want to set my sequence settings to the clip. This now produces actual slow motion utilizing all of the 60 frames. So we're cool...sort of.

I'm going to be going through tons of footage, and I want to be able to work with the footage in a single sequence that will be for the most part 100% normal speed, but then be able to change certain clips in FCP with ease to slow motion.

Right now it seems like I have to stick with a 24fps timeline, but then just speed up clips to get them to be the normal speed because slowing down pieces doesn't use all 60fps and instead just blends or dupes frames. 

Am I going about this all wrong or what?

     I have been having an issue with a specific feature of Final Cut Pro X's multicam feature and am looking for help/advice. I did a 2 camera shoot that took place over 4 hours and had several long takes approximately 15. What I am attempting to do is to create 1 multicam clip that includes all of my takes. so essentially I am trying to get a 4 hour long multicam clip. I have all of my footage (15 takes) with each camera imported in an event. I set the meta data on all the clips as such (take 1 angle 1 camera 1) (take 2 angle 1 camera 1) (take 3 angle 1 camera 1) all the way to (take 15 angle 1 camera 1) and I have done the same with my second camera and set the meta data as (take 1 angle 2 camera 2) (take 2 angle 2 camera 2) etc. Once all of that is set I select all 30 clips and click ""Make Multi-Clip"" I kept all of my settings on automatic and use audio for sync.  when it is finished I opened the Multicam clip and all of my footage from both of my cameras are there in the right order but only the first two takes are synced.
 
     I thought this might be a glitch so I tried again and the same thing happened, the first two takes are the only thing synced. So I then went and put markers on clips 3-15 on both cameras at the same point in the audio, and tried again except under angle synchronization I selected use markers. This time after Final Cut finished analyzing I checked the multicam clip and the first 3 takes were synced this time and 4-15 were still not. I assume that the marker thing worked but only for the first take that has markers.  I thought maybe it was because I had too many takes and I tried 10 takes from each camera and then 5 and then 4. The same thing happened every time only the first two takes were synced. I also tried to just use two takes per multiclip and then copy and paste them all into one multicam clip. But FCP does not let me copy and paste multiclips for some reason.
 
     Does anyone have experience with this and using FCP X's Multicam feature to put multiple takes in the same clip? I have done several hours of research and not found any tutorials on this. Only people syncing many angles on one take. Any help will be much appreciated I am getting really frustrated with this and I hope I am just overlooking something. Please advise.

First, I want to say that this post is not me begging for a step-by-step tutorial (unless one already exists!), I just want some pointers on where I should get started.

I have some gameplay footage from a video game I play, and I would like to do what I think will be a very neat visual effect periodically through the video. I want to add text to the scenes as if the text is actually in the game as a physical object.

What I mean is, for instance, I throw a grenade around a corner and take out two enemies. I don't actually see the enemies go down, instead, white pieces of text saying ""owned,"" ""lol,"" etc, come out of the hallway and bounce off of a wall nearby as if the grenade had sent the text flying. The text doesn't need anything overly fancy like lighting effects matching the scene, but perspective accuracy would be nice.

I realize that this is probably a much huger undertaking than I am making it out to be, but if there are tools or tricks for doing precisely this kind of thing, I would really appreciate any advice you can give.

It's been over a year since I edited something creative for myself. The past year I was mainly doing small, local concerts. So I think I have some rust on me and just want help in finding it. 

I have a request as to how you critique. First, please watch the video and then read what I tried to do. What I planned on doing changed into something else. (Or if the video is just bad, please just say so.)

The video is a fan-made trailer for the upcoming video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7gxYGCalyo


So here's what I tried to do and what happened in the end:

Originally I was planning on making it a satire. For those of you who follow the video game world, the game got a lot of flak because of the overuse of the dog. I decided to try and make a ""dramatic"" trailer with the dog as the main subject. That's why there is a lot of slow-mo and some 'glint' effects. Originally the ending was a lot dumber than what it is now. 
However, after coming back to it after a day or so I decided to take a slightly more serious tone while trying to keep some comedy in the video. I toned down the 'glint' effect and changed up the ending. 

My main concern is that I ended up in the middle where it's not clear if I wanted to do a satire or an actual dramatic trailer, so the video is just not good. 

If I succeeded in my goal of having a subtly satirical trailer I'll be pretty happy, but (most likely) if I didn't I'll need some help getting to it.

I al not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here goes.

I am trying to export a project exactly the same way as I have been for the last couple of months, but all of a suddent Media Encoder won't have it.

The format I am exporting in is H.264 (match source) selected in Premiere and then queued to Media Encoder.

I can export directly from Premiere but the quality suffers a bit, noticeably enough.

I have tried exporting as Quicktime with the H.264 codect and as a Windows Media file but both have the same issue.

The issue is that Media Encoder just hangs at ""Reading XMP"", and then goes no further. I can export just video (unchecking audio) completely fine, but only audio or both video and audio doesn't work.

When I check the file (after closing Media Encoder when it hangs at ""Reading XMP"") the file type is .M4V with a seperate file for audio, not the usual .MP4.

I tried opening an older autosave version of the project and the same thing happened. Right now I am stuck as to what could be causing this. Effectively nothing has changed since two days ago when I last exported.

Import THAT into Encore and away we go.

Here is some info:

* I filmed with two Canon XA10s, which create .mts files. 1920x1080i HD.
* The audio files are from the performance's CDs, which I ripped as .wma files.
* The first half is 49:52;02 (less than an hour).
* I exported it as a .mp4 for digital upload (i.e. YouTube) with no problem.
* I'm using Sony DVD Architect 6.0 for the DVDs, so I'm exporting the file as .mpg using Vegas' preset setting for Architect; (720x480 16:9, 29.97 fps). I've used this in the past for the last 2 recitals with Vegas 10 and had no issues.
* I am changing the settings a bit to be CBR at 8,000,000 Mbps. Again, done this in the past - zero issues. I even changed it to 7,000,000 bps and again to 6,000,000 and still crashed.
* My system is running Win 7 (64 bit), with 16 GB RAM, and an Intel i5 3.3 GHz 
* From what I can tell, it doesn't crash in the same spot so I doubt it is a specific file.
* When I export, I close all other programs and don't touch my computer, allowing it full use of the system resources.
* Lastly, I own Vegas Pro 12. I didn't pirate it or anything.

- MPEG-4 movie
- 1920 × 1080
- H.264, AAC

The exported file runs fine in Quicktime and am happy with the output so far. I've made 4 of these and on their own they run fine. What I wanted to do now that they've been exported is to put them back into Premiere Pro and combine them into one completed time lapse video.

Is this a problem with the .mp4 format? Is there any way to rectify this? Export the videos in a different format before bringing them back into Premiere Pro?

I was wondering if there was a cheap tape deck or cheap camcorder that you guys could recommend to me that I can purchase and use solely for the purposes of capturing the HD 1080i footage to my computer?  I was searching around, but I am not experienced with HD (first time doing this, always used regular MiniDV before this) and was not finding many results.

If you need any more info or anything like that, feel free to ask.

These clips are intermingled with picture files, and different audio. this is the 4th night I have tried to fix this, and I have no time to create the project again on another software.  The crashes will not happen if 

1. The clips are shorter than about 4 seconds 

2. there are no video clips.

Any advice on a low cost easy-to-use option?
