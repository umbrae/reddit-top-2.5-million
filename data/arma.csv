ACRE will be ported ASAP to the A3 Alpha. As soon as lazy evaluation is added to the Alpha and CBA is fully ported (which will be quickly after lazy eval) I will start work on porting ACRE to A3. I do not expect it to be that much of a challenge, though there might be some limitations to what is ported at this time (specifically backpack radios, though the 148 can serve just as well as any MANPACK, and Stratis doesn't really need more than a 148 at this time).

Furthermore, ACRE2 has been in development for some time now, and its work continues for both A2 and A3.

So fear not, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. :)

PS.

People might be confusing me with Jaynus, the other ACRE dev. Jaynus has been on somewhat of a long term sabbatical from the Arma community, but ACRE has always been a two person endeavor and we are both fully capable of continuing work.

If you've played any amount of Wasteland lately I'm sure you've noticed the influx of skiddies who learned to use google. We at the Midnight Crew have been running successful A2 Wasteland servers for the past few months. We currently are running 2 A3 Wasteland servers, one US (closed) and one EU (open).  We have 2 great coders who will be tweaking and adding different aspects into the mission file, as well as a large group of active admins who are available 24/7. I'd like to extend to you all the opportunity to play on our passworded US server. We can password the EU one as well in the near future if need be. These are both dedicated Vilayer 4CPU/6GB setups. 

Sounds good? Head over to our steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/The_Midnight_Crew Here you can enter the group chat where i will hand out the password. That's it, no fees or hoops to jump through. I look forward to playing with you all! Shoot me a comment if you have any questions.

Coming from Battlefield, where I thought the community *there* was relatively mature (oh boy), I'm still in awe about how in every single one of the servers I've joined, when there are people speaking... they're either talking about relevant mission/status information or politely shooting the shit.

Not to say that immature assholes don't exist, but I have yet to come across them in this hugely popular alpha. Even the kids who sound like they're 12 don't run around calling everyone faggots.

Sure, I've seen my share of hackers in the Alpha so far (teleporting people, ESP/wallhacks, etc), but that's a given for any multiplayer PC shooter. That's all just noise compared to the amazing community.

So I just want to say thank you to all the awesome people in the Arma community!

1373527345.0,160,self.arma,1i2fm6,As a server admin this is very important to me. Please upvote this on the ArmA 3 Feedback page.,182,22,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1i2fm6/as_a_server_admin_this_is_very_important_to_me/,"Hi r/arma,


It is this: http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=9111 (account required to upvote)


What it proposes is the ability to download missions the server is running via HTTP.


What does this mean for you, the player:

* Faster download speeds when downloading new missions

* Less of a lag (red chains) when a new player joins

Wat it means for the admins among us:

* Less hickups and wondering what is happening that is slowing down the server.



A bit of backstory:
If a player joins and he doesn't have the missions that is required, it downloads it directly from the server. The bulky ArmA Dedicated Server software is great at telling us where the enemies are and who is shooting what at who. But it is a not a server optimized for file-transfers for (large) files like missions. So in general the downloads are pretty slow as compared to other protocols (like HTTP) and causes a noticeble drop in server performance if the file is large enough and the server is busy.


Downloading files from HTTP servers for games like these and has been implemented a decade ago by some games that allow modding or creation of your own maps. ArmA in this case lags beghind.


Dwarden, a developer at BIS proposed this idea (he was about 4 hour before me on posting this). Although he is a developer, he is still bound by planning made by the project manager (Joris-Jan van 't Land). If this has more upvotes he can actually make a case with the PM as the community requested this.


So please, as a humble server admin I beg of you, please upvote this. It will make our lives so much better!


As a thank you, [here is a picture of a cat as seen in ArmA 4](http://mediapickle.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130203-110609.jpg)

I've never played ARMA before, but Dslyecxi's videos convinced me to buy into the alpha.

Even after watching the videos, I was surprised by this game, how well it runs, how good it looks, how great teamwork and communication feels, how many commands can be mapped comfortably to one hand's keys. 

I've played only about an hour of single player and an hour of multiplayer, but I can't stop gushing about it. I got killed by an easy bot, killed an easy bot, killed two easy bots in my underwear, didn't crash a helicopter coming out of a barrel roll, fought my way down a village street with my squad, saved two lives with non-contact CPR, watched my squad get demolished by invisible fire, drove a truck on a S&amp;D mission based on orders called over the radio, engaged enemies hidden in bushes at 500 meters, and had a great time doing it.

It's strangely heartwarming to play a game that just gives the player all the power. If you're here wondering if you should buy the game, the answer is yes. If you're here as a long-time player, I'd just like to thank you for keeping this game's community so vibrant and active.

Step 2: Now go to your Arma 2 directory (normaly C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 2) and copy the AddOns folder there to your recently created folder in the arma 3 directory (the @Arma folder you just created).

Step 3: Since Arma III is not Arma II you will need to delete some files of what you copied over. You will need to delete the following files:

editor.pbo

editor.pbo.bi.bisign

editor.pbo.bi2.bisign

ui.pbo

ui.pbo.bi.bisign

ui.pbo.bi2.bisign

UIFonts.pbo

UIFonts.pbo.bi.bisign

uifonts.pbo.bi2.bisign

modules.pbo

modules.pbo.bi.bisign

modules.pbo.bi2.bisign

anims.pbo

anims.pbo.bi.bisign

anims.pbo.bi2.bisign

if you leave any of these files in you will get a black screen at the intro. (If you dont delete anims the walking animation will be fucked up)

Step 4: Now in steam right click Arma 3 Alpha &gt; Properties &gt; Set Launch Options... and put ""-mod=@Arma"" in that text field that pop up and press OK

Step 5: Start the damn thing. It will take a significantly longer time to get to the main menu since its so much to load. Now when your at the main menu go to editor and there your go.

Notes:

1. Spawning in characters from arma 2 will crash the game. (most likely because of new clothing system and such) 

2. Most of the reload animations of the arma 2 weaps does not work in most stances.

3. Scuba Diving does work in charnarus and utes but the under water terrain is not that pretty...

4. You will get a metric shit load of errors and such playing this... that is quite hard to avoid without reprogramming arma II so DEAL WITH IT!

5.

The one thing that I'm not trying to do is draw a parallel between Arma and Battlefield or COD games. Hell, I'm not even trying to draw a comparison against Arma and any gaming community. Well - any game other than Operation Flashpoint.

I'll be honest, I missed the band wagon on Arma and Arma 2. But, I did play OFP for 4 years online. I know that the game has grown in many ways (graphically, modding, missions, popularity, etc). Yet, when I started playing Arma 3, I figured that it would be like the ""old days"". I know that as we age, our fond memories are often obscured by what we liked, and we don't focus much on what we didn't like about a particular aspect of something. 

However, it wasn't much like the ""old days"" when I jumped into Arma 3 online. This community is very different than from before - and these aren't just hazy memories. In some ways I kind of feel like it's for the worst. Just, in some ways. What's my biggest gripe with the community? Well, for one; people seem to lack ... personality. I'm not saying that the tons of users that I've played with across different servers don't have personalities in real life, but they don't let them shine through much in-game. I attribute this to the fact that the game now tries even harder to portray ""Military Simulation"".

Back in OFP we would play missions together, use terms like ""RGR"", and have the general ranking structure in clans. But now, with Arma, everything from how you are supposed to speak in chat, to how you play the game is trying to be 100% accurate, and frankly - it's wrong. How do I know this? Well, I served in the US Army Infantry from 05-09. We didn't always ""act like soldiers"". We used call signs, and really followed SOP and tactics in battle; yet on our down time, or when not patrolling, we dicked off. We joked, we hung out, we played video games, etc.

I know that ARMA mainly focuses on in game battles and not the actual life of a Soldier, but I can't help but feel the entire thing is so **forced** now. Even in OFP, players would focus on having fun, and the interaction between people in chat and in game seemed much more relaxed, and open natured. Now, things seemed rigid, forced, and just... a turn off. Players will get pissed off at other players for not doing X, or start commanding them to do X, Y, Z ""or-else"". Even just playing a COOP mission seems broken to me. It's sort of hard to place my finger on, but the community just doesn't feel as welcoming as it used to. It's kind of like a secret club. The rules are unspoken, and there are many, many rules.

Every, single, server that I have joined has given me the sense that you aren't supposed to talk about ANYTHING other than the mission. No mission, no talk. Maybe I haven't tried every server, but I've tried as many as I've seen in the list, and almost each one is full of people who take themselves way too seriously. I know that this game isn't COD, or BF - but the community needs to relax a bit. Even as an old OFP vet, I'm not feeling a very welcoming vibe from the current community. Maybe the difference is that ARMA focuses more on COOP milsim, where as OFP's main highlight during the MP days was Capture the flag, and clan vs. clan type of matches. And these matches weren't always CQB - we also had huge maps with choppers, tanks, etc, etc. 

In closing - I just want to say this this community doesn't HAVE TO BE milsim only. OFP was mainly a competitive, clan vs. clan, CQB mutliplayer type of environment for a long time. It was amazing to have a rivalry between ACES and [Dragon Knights](http://www.dragon-knights.info/) (teams who the entire community knew and looked up to - teams who were really f'ing good). It was so fun to practice with your 10 man clan on Friday night and Saturday just to get ready for that long awaited showdown with your bitter rivals on Sunday. I don't see ARMA having a big competitive gaming aspect to it - and I think that may be whats watering down the game. People are so stuck on one aspect (MILSIM), that they can't see the forest for the trees. 

Forget FORCING ACRE on people. Forget commands and yessir/nosir. Forget what the norm is, and have fun with this game. This community feels kind of like a beat and battered person in a relationship. Some people are too afraid to speak up or speak out about being put into a corner. I see that new people WANT to play the game, but it takes itself so seriously sometimes, the learning curve is insane. Even for me... and I lived and breathed OFP and the military.

There seems to be a ton of elitism in the community these days; either by people in these huge realsim groups, or others who don't seem as welcoming to new-commers unless you conform to said group, or said gameplay style. I'm not saying that this is the case for everyone (I've met many cool people) - but the whole ""Milsim"" thing is missing one very important aspect: Personality.
 

TL:DR: None.

We've made some changes in the subreddit to facilitate/herald the coming of ArmA 3 over the past few months, including a huge update to the subreddit's appearance and sidebar, and adding the [unit spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj_IvvssIuaSdGkyMnpndUhwUjl6WUJkUHh1aUlkTWc#gid=0), a much requested(and in some cases demanded) sidebar addition. 

I'm not sure what the future holds for the subreddit or ArmA in general, but we can all rest assured that it will certainly be an interesting ride.

Big thanks to everyone that contributes here and for continuing to support ArmA and /r/ArmA.

Im not very good at making long drawn out sentences so I will get straight to the point and hope to help some of you. This is my first ever guide so be gentle :)

My specs are: Intel i5 2500, GTX560, 8gb Cosair RAM, 128GB Samsung 830 SSD (Arma 3 is running of this) so you an adjust the settings bellow slightly if you have a more powerful pc. I get between 40-60 in singleplayer and 30-45 in mp (Project Awesome server)

The base settings I am going to work off are [these](http://i.imgur.com/tBSYCcC.jpg). With these settings we get 33-45 fps on the showcase Infantry. The game can still look very good at these settings as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/s1QABNO.jpg) (35 fps in this picture with no optimizations).

**LOAD TIMES**

* -nosplash -noPause (Disables intros)

* -world=empty (Loads an empty world on startup)

**PERFORMANCE**

* -cpuCount=4 -exThreads=7 (These force arma to use all of your cpu and threads)
* -maxmem=8192 -maxvram=1024 (1gb = 1024, 2gb = , 4gb = 4096, 8gb = 8192)

This line would be put into your Arma 3 launch options.

eg: -nosplash -noPause -world=empty -cpuCount=4 -exThreads=7 -maxmem=8192 -maxvram=1024

With all these added parameters added I got an addition 10 fps. Results may very for you.

---

Here a few more system settings that can be applied to increase performance.

First open up msconfig (Windows key + R brings up Run, enter msconfig.exe and hit enter) go over to the Startup tab and disable any unnecessary programs and then restart your computer. Depending on the amount of unused programs your performance boost will vary.

Second open the start menu, right click on Computer and go to properties, on the left click Advanced system settings, under the performance section click settings, and use the [following](http://i.imgur.com/WJFbjlE.png)

With these changes I gained another 5 fps. As I already said results will vary

Although these changes may seem minor, I find them to improve my gameplay.

I fucked the formatting with a copy/paste, should be fixed now.

Hi there, just wanted to point out some things that I spend a lot of time explaining to my squads and groups in-game. Some may seem completely obvious, others a little obscure and small, but hopefully you'll get something out of this, if not a small refresher course. I'm at work on a shitty PC, so you'll have to bear with me on replies/formatiing/etc. Feel free to tell me to fuck off and post over there if that's what is appropriate. Thank you.


**The Map**

* Arguably one of the most important pieces of equipment in-game. What I'll be covering is some basic shortcuts, keybinds, and small tips that a lot of you are probably missing out on.

* Holding Shift+Left Click will place a personal waypoint, and will display in-game on most servers the distance and location of said waypoint. This is useful for sniping, and just getting a bearing/distance to a specific location. **/u/KiwiThunda Says:** I find waypoints are somewhat game-breaking. They double as a range-finder when you're sniping, also if you get enemy markers on your map, you can pinpoint enemy positions in your view.
Waypoints are disabled by default on veteran/expert/mercenary difficulty servers (Arma 2).

* Double-clicking will place a marker. Depending on what chat channel you're in (scroll with ""&lt;"" and ""&gt;"") will determine who sees the marker. Direct is only for you, group is for your group, side is for your team, global is for everyone. Keep this in mind, as you don't want to give away that weapon cache, but don't want to forget where it is.

* When placing a marker, and still in the ""naming"" phase (where a text-box shows up), press Up Arrow or Down Arrow to change the marker icon. This includes red arrows, a flag, a single dot, etc. Looks better and is more professional/informative than a circle with an ""X"". This is excellent for showing the team your base, marking specific objects, and taking up less room than the default icon. Plus, you'll look all official and shit.
**/u/epiclulz4real says:**
&gt; Also, on the map portion, when placing a marker you can hold shift and press Up Arrow/Down Arrow(correct me if I'm wrong) it will change the color of the marker you are placing for even more organization.

* Learn grid coordinates. Easy tutorials for this all over the web. 067094 should take 10 seconds to find on your map, and is easier than saying ""Staroye"" as a lot of people have to search the map in a mid-zoom level for this town.


**Vehicles**

* A huge part of wasteland. and Arma in general, a lot is missed out on for vehicles.

* The first person in a car is generally the only person that can switch to gunner, passenger, and driver without pulling over and getting out first. Keep this in mind, as it's a lot better to have your gunner in a seat than exposed out the roof. Let him hop in the back first, then get in as driver.

* If you can't hear voice chat, go to first-person mode. It's generally a lot quieter.

* If you're on a mounted turret, and aim-down-sights isn't working, try pressing ""0"" on the num-pad. This should fix it for you.

* If you hate steering with the mouse, just double-tap Left Alt. You can steer with A and D, and free-look.

* Q is slow-drive, W is mid-drive, and E is full-speed. Shift will bump you up to the next speed temporarily, and it's a bit easier on some people to hold E instead of Shift + W to go full-speed. This applies to water/land craft only, aircraft is another monster to tackle.

* Don't fly unless you have flown succesfully before. Landing softly and taking enemy hits is a hell of a lot less embarrassing than crashing into a tree with 16/16 occupants inside.

* If gear isn't going in the vehicle, it's full. Your gear is (hopefully) on the ground near/under the vehicle, or in the water if you're using a boat. There are no indicators that the car is full, as far as I knwo.

* You can kill the engine and roll down-hill or with your momentum, but if you hit Q, W, or E, it will start the engine again. You can fully steer, however.


**Weapons**

* Just some basic pro-tips a lot of you already know.

* Sniper scopes are not all the same. NATO/US/UK/Russian/Czech all use different styles, scope-measurements, etc. 

* Pressing "";"" (or "":"", same thing) will quickly switch weapons. You can re-bind this to, say, a mouse key, or even spacebar if you wanted. I use this in particular when I have an IED or satchel set up, because you can easily accidentally set it off from your scroll menu when trying to change weapons in a pinch.

* If you modify your FOV (recommended, especially if 1st person makes you sick) the scope's mil-dots will not be correct. Open the editor, lay out targets at 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and so on meters (1 grid sqaure at max zoom = 100m) and try out your mil-dots.

* **/u/b0dhi Says:** Also, the scopes on most of the Russian rifles don't work properly - the chevrons for zeroing don't indicate what they're supposed to indicate. For the SVD, chevrons beyond 600m aren't correct. For the VSS Vintorez, they're almost all completely incorrect.You'll need to use US/Brit sniper rifles if you want to accurately snipe long distance.


**General Tips**

* Do not spam VOIP. Do not use VOIP on Global.

* Let your squad (probably note all of BluFor) know where you are (you shouldn't be too far from them), and what you're doing periodically. If you see an enemy, follow your mission SOP, return fire, and let your team know, most importantly. Regardless of what mission you're playing, self-defense is always acceptable, unless (almost too rare to mention) specifically guided otherwise not to shoot back. Let your team know when you're using explosives or approaching them, as friendly fire is the shittiest thing you can do, regardless of circumstance. Also, if you approach unannounced and are shot, any decent admin will realize **YOU** are at fault.

* Make a group. This can be objective team, defenders, attackers, etc. This will also allow Group Chat, which is great for not spamming your entire team about an enemy they are nowhere near. Best use is for buddies without TS3 or if your team is well organized.

* If you're a loner, or VOIP on the Indie side is bothering you (open mic, mic spam, people in general) turning down VOIP all the way will still allow direct/vehicle chat, but turn off Side/Global chat. Admins (good ones, at least) never make important announcements over VOIP, and VOIP is never a really good source of globally important information.

* Be aware that in most cases anything you say in any channel still plays over Direct. This include vehicle, group, side, and global. Enemy nearby? Type something if you need to communicate with your team, otherwise they'll hear someone on direct, possibly not only giving away your position, but the position of your other team elements. If you're talking shit about someone in Vehicle Chat, make sure they're not within like 20m, otherwise they'll hear you.

* PLAY THE ARMA TUTORIALS BUILT INTO THE GAME BEFORE EVER, EVER TOUCHING MULTIPLAYER. IF YOU ASK ME HOW TO TOSS A FRAG, I AM GOING TO TELL YOU TO DIE IN A FIRE. PROBABLY NOT THAT MEAN BUT YOU GET THE POINT.


**/u/capri_stylee Says:**

* I'm reluctant to share this, because few people seem to know about it, and it can/will sway a firefight in your favour, but if you're group leader, press 'del' on your num pad to switch to commanders view, then use + and - on the num pad to zoom in and out, use the mouse to rotate your view. This gives you a birds eye view of your surroundings, extremely useful in open fields or towns, pretty much useless in dense forest though. If you are in a vehicle when you activate it your camera will be even higher (~75m high on foot, double that in a vehicle).
Its OP as fuck and I'd like to see it removed, but since its in the game and some are already using it, everyone should know about it.
FWIW i know this works on sa-matra, not sure about 404 or other mods.



Again, just some small things people miss a lot. If you have anything to add, leave a comment, or PM me. I'll toss it in somewhere.

* EDIT 1: Added more tips, general section, suggestion from user.
* EDIT 2: Formatting.
* EDIT 3: More tips.
* EDIT 4: Copy/Pasting little bullets doesn't work so well. Hopefully fixed for most browsers. Sorry about that. Thank you very much, /u/ownagebyte

You can mess around with stuff there or you can just go in game. I would suggest Global setting so you can change it in game.

I had no idea that the game I spent 5 of the best years of my life is - and has been - still alive under a different name.

I began playing OFP: CWC back in 2001 when I was 15 years old, and I made it through to the expansion pack: Resistance - playing OFP for 5 years. Hell, I remember playing it when the 2 towers fell. Yeah. I played with some old school players when I was in highschool; staying up till 4am on custom MP maps with players from the UK. I loved every aspect of OFP, and I just found out about Arma. I have no words to express my excitement for this series. OFP was THE game that showed me what true sandbox gameplay could be. No other game has held a torch to it's open nature, flexible customization - and great community of players. 

I am building a new gaming rig just for Arma 3, and I hope to run into some old friends from my OFP days. I know I've missed Arma and Arma 2 - but I hope this game is as good as it looks. To put it into perspective for you... OFP is the game that introduced me to PC gaming and set the bar for what gaming should be. I think it's also the reason I ended up joining the Army - lmao. I just remember when BF1942 came out and America's Army; they were the two ""new"" FPS competing games on Gamespy Arcade (which was what we used to connect to OFP with) - similar to Steam now-a-days. God, I feel old.

""Back in my day sonny, we didn't have this ""Steam"". We had a bloated peace of shit called Gamespy Arcade...""

Anyways... I'm happy to have found this sub, too. Just thought I needed to tell someone. If anyone here was around during the Cold War Crisis days, hit me up, my handle was Oddball. 

Hexenkessel was the best CQB mp map ever.

BTW: By next week I should have my new rig built. I'm looking to play COOP missions with some nice, mature players who can take an old OFP'r under their wing. I love MP - but man, COOP missions were always a blast. Just someone to help me catch up on what mods I need, maps, etc, etc.

Even in its alpha state, they could have released it like this (but with more content) and I wouldn't have complained. There are a few bugs but most of them are minor. The majority of players are getting pretty good performance from even modest hardware configurations and the game is graphically a major leap beyond Arma 2. 

I haven't had a chance to explore all of the systems yet and fully acclimatize myself to the game but right now, I have to say that I'm more than happy with it. From the big scale down to the small (CQB) scale, the game handles itself just as good as any other FPS game with a lot more flexibility when it comes to movement and customization. 

I forgot I was playing Arma much of the time, especially when we were breaching a compound and the responsiveness of the game combined with the tight, focused gameplay made me feel more like I was playing a tactical CQB shooter than an open world one. This level of polish is quite a bit beyond what BI has accomplished in the past, even after numerous patches and updates. 

My only complaint beyond the few, minor bugs is that the AI isn't exactly a quantum leap above Arma 2. It's noticeably better and much more of a worthy adversary but even in the few hours of play I partook in, I saw quite a bit of derp. 

**tl;dr** Once Arma 2's community with all of it's mods and passion fully transition to Arma 3 (which could happen pretty soon), then I am certain that it will surpass the best of what Arma 2 had the offer rather easily. It was worth the wait and I could even see a lot of non-Arma fans being converted.

I present my baseball cap head tracking rig.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/yfVCT)

[Here is a video I made of mine shorty after finishing it.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_u2vLlduvI)  It shows how well it works and also goes over the advantages of it for Arma, most of which will be obvious to readers here, but I made it to show friends who had no idea why I was making this thing.

In total the rig required a hat, three LEDs, one 9 volt battery connector, one resistor, and a bit of wire and solder.  You will also need a webcam to be able to do this, I have a Logitech HD C310 Webcam which works like a charm, and I imagine any decent webcam should be fine.  I got all the components from RadioShack, except for the resistor I had on hand already, for a total of 7.39 USD.  An hour of putting it together and a bit of tuning and its working like a charm.  So here’s how I did it.

I’d like to first mention that a lot of the information I found was from [this site]( http://www.free-track.net/english/) and [this forum]( http://forum.free-track.net/).  Unfortunately the FreeTrack program seems to have died, and the software doesn’t seem to be compatible with Windows 7, but all of the information about building the light rigs is still valid.

Many people swear by only using infrared LEDs and modifying your webcam to only view IR light, but I didn’t want to ruin my webcam that way so I went with using visible light LEDs.  They work fine for what I’m doing, and I don’t find them a distraction at all.  While they might not work as perfectly as IR lights, I’ve had no real problems with them.

**How to build your own**

First you will need to determine if you want to go with a clip or hat build.  The clip, seen [here]( http://i.imgur.com/kDwPBXY.jpg) attaches to your headset via some sort of clasp mechanism, whereas the hat as shown much more neatly than mine [here]( http://i.imgur.com/4NpWxzT.jpg) is entirely self-contained.  I decided to go with the hat build because I wanted to be able to mount the battery to it, and I feel like putting on the hat would be much easier than clipping on the bracket every time I need it.

Regardless of which style you decide to go with, you’ll need some certain components.
* 3 LEDs – I used the basic 5mm Red LEDs from RadioShack
* Battery Connector – I used a 9V battery, so I got the “Heavy Duty 9V Battery Snap Connectors” pack of 5 from RadioShack.
* A resistor, more on this later.
* Wire
* Solder
* Electrical tape, its handy for lots of things.
* A hat or something to build the clip out of.  I read that a wire hanger is close to ideal, easy enough to bend but durable enough to hold its shape.

The resistor is the only somewhat tricky part of this build, and I’ll be honest I’m not a circuits expert so if what I say here is wrong, I’m sorry.  Using [this website]( http://ledcalculator.net/), and a bit of research that told me these LEDs run well at about 2 volts across them at 20 mA, I determined that I needed a 150 ohm resistor.  Since all I had on hand was a 100 ohm resistor, and knowing that the max voltage on the LEDs is 2.6V, max current 28 mA, and knowing that there’s some leeway when it comes to these kinds of things, I just went with the 100 ohm resistor.  Again, I’m no expert, but the combo seems to be working fine, but if you’re going out to get a resistor and are using a 9V battery with three 5mm LEDs, a 150 ohm resistor should be good.

After determining which style you want to go with and getting all the materials, take a look at the following images.

[Clip](http://i.imgur.com/IPCQi1t.png)

[Hat](http://i.imgur.com/Ql2t0us.png)

These images are from the FreeTrack Handbook, located [here](http://www.free-track.net/fichiers/manuel21en.pdf).  It’s fairly outdated software wise, but the hardware hasn’t changed much since FaceTrack was in development, so the information carries over.

The part on the right of those images is the important part, the dimensions they give that the rig should roughly have.  For instance the LEDs on the bill of the hat should be roughly 140 mm apart, and the single one in the middle should be 100 mm behind the other two, and 80 mm above them.  The LEDs don’t have to be exactly there as you can edit the dimensions in software later, but try to get them close.

Once you know your dimensions, you can start planning it out.  For the hat I basically marked where I wanted the LEDs with a sharpie, if you’re doing the clip style you’ll need to go ahead and build it.  I don’t have pictures of the building process but I’ll try to lay out everything I did.

* I first cut up some strips of electrical tape and used them to tape down the leads on the LEDs such that the three LEDs pointed forward.
* Then I taped the 9V battery to the back of the hat.  I’m planning on possibly making some kind of harness out of canvas that I can use to swap out batteries when they die, but for now it’s just crudely taped onto the back.
* With the battery in place, I lined the 9V battery connector up so it was in roughly the right place to latch onto the battery, and with the wires going over the top of the hat.
* I then soldered in a wire going from the Positive lead of the battery connector to the Positive lead of the first LED I hooked up.  (The positive lead is the longer of the two.)
* From there, connect a wire from the negative lead on that first LED to the positive on the second, then again positive of second to negative of the third.
* I then connected a bit of wire from the third LED negative lead, ran it across the bill of the cap, and to one end of the 100 ohm resistor.
* A last piece of wire connected the other end of the resistor to the Negative lead of the Battery connector, completing the circuit.

With everything soldered and taped into place, I hooked up the battery and it started up perfectly.  Now onto the software portion of the project.

I had originally intended to use the FreeTrack program, but all developments seems to have stopped and I couldn’t get it working on Windows 7.  However another program, FaceTrackNoIR, works perfectly for this as well with a plugin called PointTracker which comes with the program.  You can download FaceTrackNoIR [here]( http://facetracknoir.sourceforge.net/information_links/download.htm).  

**FaceTrackNoIR Setup**

* Under Tracker Source(1st = Master) select PointTracker 1.0.
* In Tracker Source settings, go to model.  Select Clip or Cap, and grab a ruler.  As accurately as you can measure the dimensions of how your rig turned out, and enter them here.  Make sure it’s in millimeters.
* The only other thing you might need to do is set up the Curves.  [Here’s]( http://i.imgur.com/7RAvK0Z.png) a screenshot of mine.  If you look closely you’ll notice a little circle at the beginning of each curve.  This basically creates a dead spot in the middle of your vision, so slight head moves won’t move the camera so it’s not constantly jittering, but if you turn a bit farther it performs like normal.

You’ll also need to tweak your webcam settings in order to get this to work.  The basic idea is to set your exposure and gain as low as possible.  This will basically make it so only light source show up very clearly.  To further this effect, jack up the contrast as heavily as you can, further exaggerating the difference between the background and the three bright lights.

[Here is a photo of my webcam settings and the view it sees with them.]( http://i.imgur.com/8N7zqu3.png)

Alright so, that’s about all I can think of.  I’ll answer any questions I can about the build and possibly helping others with one as well.  Hopefully this will enable some others to build your own.

1363970012.0,56,self.arma,1at1n6,The AI in this game is relentless! [Arma 3 Alpha Lite],65,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1at1n6/the_ai_in_this_game_is_relentless_arma_3_alpha/,"I'm not *too* new to Arma as I've owned Arma 2 since the release of OA, but I've had very few experiences as intense as this one.

I was messing around in the editor for the Alpha and just wanted to get a simple firefight going. No goals or objectives(I don't even know how to make those) so I just edit in some BLUFOR and OPFOR around the main town on Stratis. I assigned myself to a normal ""Rifle Squad"" for BLUFOR and figured that I would just play for a bit before trying something else.

What ended up happening was that my entire squad (and the other BLU squad I made) got wiped out, and I alone survived. I decided to just see if I could get out of town alive, so I ran away under enemy fire up the hill to the north and near the church and radio tower. What I didn't expect was for troops to follow me up there, including one of their ""Ifrit GMG"" jeeps. 

Eventually an unlucky Machinegunner spotted me and got shot as a result. In a panic I simply sprinted away to the east while grenades and bullets splashed around me. Thinking I had lost them I doublebacked a bit to see what they were up to. I figured I was far enough away that I could use my binocs to spy on them. After a few minutes, one of the soldiers spotted me and they started firing on me again.

This time I made sure to gain some distance away from the soldiers, but unfortunately the Ifrit GMG had actually followed me through the valley between the northern hills. As I continued running for my life, hoping to make it to the eastern cliffs, I would occasionally hear the pop of a grenade launcher followed shortly by an explosion near me(the only reason I survived was due to a fallen medic's First Aid Kits).

Eventually I made it to the cliffs and stopped thinking I had *finally* outrun the enemy. I mean, why would they chase me to the other side of the island right? Turns out, I was still underestimating the AI in this game. After a few minutes of peace I heard the sound of a car. Frozen in fear I hid prone to the ground. The sounds got closer and eventually I saw that damn Ifrit GMG roll over the peak of the hill. I thought I was doomed, but lucky for me neither the driver nor the gunner spotted me.

The rest of the story is pretty boring. I finally got the message of how smart the AI was so I just used the cliffs as cover as I followed the coastline south to the Kill Farm. At one point I looked back to see a squad of OPFOR troops searching the point I was at earlier. The AI truly was relentless to have followed me way out there!

Anyways, after reaching the Kill Farm I went back to the town only this time much more stealthily. I didn't encounter anyone else on the journey but I finally died when an Ifrit HMG on the airfield spotted me as I went to the outpost overwatching the town and airfield.

**TL;DR: Got chased around the entire northern area of Stratis, will now have nightmares of Ifrit Jeeps following me. The whole thing lasted about an hour**

.

The Alpha-Lite runs from 14 MARCH - 18 JUNE 2013

*No Multiplayer

*No Mods




Not 100% sure about use of the editor in Lite, but I recall reading that all features are available except saving/exporting missions. 

.



edit:
If you are offering to gift invites, it may be a good idea to update your post once they're gone. Same applies to those requesting, update if you get sorted! 

[The Lite Key Giveout thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1abk97/lite_key_giveout_thread_give_away_your_lite/) is now active, so if you want to gift/receive invites you may have better luck  over there!

Well, his birthday is in a week and I wanted to see if it was possible to make a model of his gun in the game. I know people already do this, but I don't know anyone personally who can. So, I'm willing to pay for someone's talents to help me achieve this. The AR-15 isn't completed yet, so until that happens I can't provide any pictures.

In no specific order. Most of these are not limited to single use or Init line only but can be combined together in the Init or used in scripts.

**Place a unit/obect at a given height at mission start.** Want a guard in that guard tower, a mounted machine gun up there too, Sniper on a rooftop or an ammo crate on a balcony?  

    this setPos [getPos this select 0, getPos this select 1, 20]  

20 is the height in meters the unit/object will be spawned, it doesn't have to be a whole number either it could be 18.3 and you'll have to play around with it to find the right height for the situation.  
  

**Start a Unit in a vehicle.** (Helo/Boat/Plane/Truck insertion on mission start)  

    this moveincargo vehiclename  

The other commands are 'moveindriver', 'moveingunner', 'moveincommander' and 'moveinturret'. vehiclename is the one you give it in the editor, not the vehicle class name. You can also load whole groups into the cargo of a troop transport vehicle (The civilian offroad can hold 5 or 6 in cargo)  

    {_x moveInCargo vehiclename} foreach units group this;  
  

**Teleport unit with map click** Quickly explore the island, various other legitimate Uses in missions (scripted HALO insertion from an object in a base).  

    onMapSingleClick ""player setpos _pos;teleport=false""  
  
 
**Start mission with lit campfire** (Empty&gt;Objects&gt;Fireplace)  

    this inflame true



**Add weapons/items/gear to units**  

    removeallweapons this; this addWeapon ""weaponclassname""  
    this addMagazine ""magazineclassname""

See **Class Lists** for the required ammunition class names  

You should add magazines before weapons otherwise the weapons are added unloaded.
  

**Add weapons to crates/vehicles**  

    this addWeaponCargo ""weaponclassname""  
    this addMagazineCargo ""magazineclassname""

The mods, the maps and various game types available in the multiplayer section have got me very interested in this game.

I began making my own custom scenarios in Arma3 Alpha Editor, and decided to learn how to control the AI/my squad and whatnot.

Having completed nearly everything I could in the Arma3 Alpha showcases and multiplayer co op maps, I've decided to give Arma2 another go.

Holy crap, I have been having a blast so far.  Arma2 plays and looks great on my system, and I had no idea that all I really needed to do was treat this game more like a 'simulator' than an arcade shooter.

An example that has me awestruck that I just completed in the Arma2 campaign -- I assaulted a camp in the woods and sent one guy back to pick up the humvee, and had him drive it to our destination all the while I was able to secure the road for pickup.   I'm no longer stuck doing the mundane tasks of even driving to a new destination, once you start learning the AI controls the game really starts to come alive.

Anyway, perhaps some of you are really into the Arma3 alpha, have Arma2 but never really played it, I highly recommend giving it a go.  It's a lot of fun, and try to look past the painful dialogue.  There's really a gem in there under the rough edges.   Cheers!

If a mod could edit this post and remove the ""and"" from the topic, that'd be awesome! Thanks. :D

Ember is looking for individuals who have an interest in sharing their unique skillsets to further our development efforts. If you have an interest in game design and want to be a part of this ambitious project, we want to hear from you! In particular, the Ember team is currently looking for those who possess the following skills:

* Programming (C, scripting for ARMA)
* Graphic Design
* 3D modeling
* Web design (HTML, Java, PHP, SQL, Flash)
* Sound design

If you have an interest in joining our team, please submit an application at our forums here: (http://ember-mod.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?7-Join-the-Team) with a summary of your skills, how you would like to contribute, and an example of your previous work.
 



**About EMBER:**

EMBER is a post-apocalyptic simulator mod for ARMA 2 which places the player in a world on the verge of total collapse. Decades after a devastating war which utilized the most dangerous chemical and biological weapons known to man, the remnants of humanity cling to life as resources become alarmingly scarce, roving bands of raiders and cannibals wreak havoc on the remaining pockets of civilization, remnants of the military try to regain order, and mother nature itself seems hell-bent to ensure the downfall of mankind.

Players will experience a persistent, sandbox environment which will allow them to choose their own path. Like many popular sandbox-style MMOs on the market, EMBER will allow players to grow with their characters, while also risking everything in a perma-death environment. While exploring EMBER, players will encounter bands of malicious raiders killing everything in their path, as well as starving children begging for help. Some may choose to find a new life in the countryside. Others will champion the cause of the less fortunate and protect them from the horrors of the world. Others still may opt to prey on the innocent and destroy everything for their own glory.

The choice is yours.

**Features**

As the project progresses, EMBER will ultimately possess the following features:

* Custom designed, specialized ARMA island
* New character models
* Completely custom inventory of weapons, vehicles, and items designed just for EMBER
* Persistent world
* Skill acquisition – find manuals and guides to learn how to repair vehicles
* Crafting – customize vehicles, improve your weapons, and fix your gear
* Hunting and gathering – fishing, foraging for food, and more!
* Full implementation of popular ARMA 2 mods, such as ACE, ACRE, JSRS, and more!
* Custom health and hunger system
* New GUI
* Unpredictable AI behavior – civilians may offer you aid, join your cause, or attack you to defend themselves.
* Random events – blizzards, cannibal raids, military raids, etc.
* Hostile environment – some regions may harm or kill you without protective gear
* Clan support
* Interactive NPCs which can speak to players, offer items, or become hostile at a moment’s notice.",,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_12m9vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/12m9vx/developers_wanted_for_new_arma_mod/,

I've personally had a few questions for the devs and I'm looking to set up a second interview (email interview) with either Jay or Joris to talk about the game. What questions would you like me to ask if I am able to get interview time with them? Questions I personally will be asking:

**1. The list of vehicles on your release webpage, are they the only ones we're going to see or are you holding back a few to surprise us upon release?**

**2. Is rain going to be re-implimented back into the game? If it is, will rain cause any sort of environmental effects in the game such as mud, or puddles?**

**3. What is the plan with Scuba? I feel like that aspect of the game could be so enjoyable but it's currently missing so much.**

**4. Will your additional content ONLY come in the DLCs or can we expect content updates in any other form?**

Just a few questions that I have. If you've seen these questions answered somewhere, let me know! Also, give me a few of your own so I can hopefully ask the Devs and post their answeres. Thanks guys.

Disclaimer: I do not claim to be an expert or to be knowledgeable on this subject. I am just here to help out the little guy. Not the guys with 100+ community sizes who have the resources, manpower and connections to research this. HC is technology still in beta. Your mileage may vary.


**General Idea behind it:**
The ArmA 2 server engine isn't the most efficient piece of software written, but it does manage to do what is required to shoot stuff in Arma2. It handles the connection between the players, takes care of the scripting, logic, triggers and handles the AI. Along with this, the server software didn't age very well and to some extent ( and with exceptions )it isn't multi-threaded and is written to work on a single core. So with huge player bases and/or with a large array of AI to combat against, there is somewhere is a tipping point where the server just implodes, generally turning a game into a lagfest (IIRC Shacktac plays TvT to by-pass this problem. No AI==happy server). Generally the health of the server is among others measured by 'server FPS'. It is important to keep this as high as possible for several reasons: 

* AI will act more naturally and will kill you faster.
* Packets will flow.

The higher the FPS the better the performance, max is 50. On an server without a mission and just one player you will see approx 48 FPS. Depending on the hardware stats (mainly CPU) your milage with 20+ players and 300-300 AI may vary.


What HC offers is a way to offload AI creation and handling to a separate process instead of tasking the server with AI duties, in overall increasing server performance and thus gameplay resulting in ~~dead~~ happy players.
What does this mean for the server:

* The server doesn't need to handle the AI and can now focus on handling traffic and misc logic/triggers etc.
What does this mean for the HC:
* The HC can now create and control AI as it pleases, carrying the load that is historically given to the server.
What does this mean for the mission maker/scripter:
* Everything the HC does, wants AI to spawn, walk or shoot must be scripted by you! ( Or like we did hi-jack UPSMON to do this for us ).

( You could use http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/setOwner, but this nukes waypoints and such. So this is less than ideal. )



**Mission making:**
As I mentioned, you need to script the AI with where they eat, sleep, shit, patrol and when and how to shoot. We at TDNL offloaded this into UPSMON because we are lazy. If you want to do this from scratch, you can work with markers, createVehicle, createUnit etc etc and give them waypoints. This is the hardest task, but as I said: hi-jack upsmon. We use it in our missions (by default) to shorten mission creation time. So this is the logical next step.

Another what is required is a unit specifically for the HC. This can be some kind of general, a civilian or a farm animal (we use a sheep) that will be the link between the HC and the mission. It doesn't matter on which side it is, just make sure it is present and give it a name like ""HCslot"" or something from which you can easily distinguish in your code between the HC and the players.

For scripts you wish to cut of players and the server from running your scripts, use fuck-off mechanisms like this:
 if (_headLessClient != player) exitwith {};
or
 if !(player == HCSlot) exitwith {};
 


**Preparing the server:**
If you have a server with several ArmA 2 servers running on top of it, you have a similar situation as I do. So carry on. If you wish to run a server and a HC on your workstation and connect it with arma2 run from the same workstation, see the MSO notes in this topic https://dev-heaven.net/issues/62500.

Licensing is an issue, or at least we thought. Somehow an ArmA 2 server doesn't have to go through the whole licensing ordeal. The headless client does count as a license, unless you edit/nerf/nutter your server config to accept duplicate key entire. But then GameSpy says NoooOOooOo. So, one server, one install, one headless client.

You need to add an important edit to the server.cfg:

 localClient[]=""{127.0.0.1}"";

This allows unlimited bandwidth from the HC to the server and back. This will impact performance or may lead to crashes. (see devhev for more info on this)


If required you are able to add multiple IP address to this line if you expect to run multiple HCs on your server from seperate hosts. The syntax would be:

 localClient[]=""{[127.0.0.1,192.168.1.10,172.18.156.97]}';

I use Arma2 launcher to launch my server and my headless client. I am lazy so it looks like this:

* Create a new profile for your headless client.
* [Choose your mods](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/HC_uitleg_addons.png)
* [Set your launch options](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/HC_uitleg_options.png). Note the Beta and note the *Additional parameter field (The password bit is redundant :s).
* Also, [you want it to connect to your server](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/HC_uitleg_online.png).
* ""Start Game"" and [it will look like something like this](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/HC_server.png).

What happens is the following:
* HC starts a ""Dedicated Client"" (Read: HC)
* Depending on your settings it should connect to your server.

Now in-game as an admin: put your HC in its designated slot.
Load up the player list with players, and start gaming.

Here at Tangodown we've created a test-mission pitting regular AI against HC AI. This is without most of the optimisations we've made since then and are still planning to.

[The results so far](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/arma2oa%202013-01-15%2020-09-35-107.png), also see the previous screenshot for debug info.



**CPU Affinity:**
You want to prevent the server and HC running on the same core. Go to your Task Manager and your process tab.
Right-click on a process, set Affinity, Choose the cores you want the process to use. Press OK and enjoy the graphs.

[It should look something like this.](http://sacha.ligthert.net/ARMA/HC_tut/HC_affinity.png)

This about wraps it up. Hope it helps.

Where are all the models, the tables, cabinets, etc? The homes are just empty boxes. This is not more than an aesthetic complaint, yet it seems uncharacteristic of the series.

It wasn't much, but it at least convinced me that people lived there and gave unique character to both Chernarus and Takistan, beyond the architectural style. Stratis is blank compared to the arma 2 maps, even if it isn't the main terrain. The biggest offender, imo, is the enterable building at big golf ball station that just has a bunch of low walls. Why? What is the point of those other than to be convenient and easy to script ai for cover? With no interior decoration, I have zero idea what the point of that building is supposed to be used for, and it comes off as bland and uninteresting.

I also run our six repository, and have been the main person to optimize our servers to the 80+ player counts you see there on a regular basis.

missions and base building.",51,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/12x377/wasteland_mod_sandbox_with_faction_wars_random/,"Hello all,

I would like to introduce you all to a mod called Wasteland by TAW_Tonic, with several individual customisation versions made available by for instance Marker.

In short, Wasteland is what others, myself included, went to when we tired of DayZ and its problems, but still wanted a nice sandbox within Arma 2 to play around with. That is what Wasteland provides.

It is set on the Chernarus map and is a playground that encourages emergent gameplay and dynamic factional warfare.

Some of its features:

- Randomised missions for the factions and independents to fight over which give rewards in form of equipment and vehicles.

- Base building

- Gun shops

- Random vehicle spawns, including some rare and prized military vehicles including light armor and helicopters.

- Randomised weapon spawns; comes from ammo caches and guns inside vehicles.

- Random AI patrols and AI present at some missions and areas.

I certainly love this mod, and when you start having large factions of 10+ people fighting over missions, towns and bases it really shines like nothing else. I hope some of you might want to test it out. 

It requires no extra downloads and you can simply get it by joining a server, as its all within a single mission file!

Filter for Wasteland in the mission setting and you will find all the servers hosting it. Currently its around 10 servers that host it. 

If you would like to join the server I love the most, because it has no lag and a well thought out balance customisation and selective spawn system implemented, filter for ""ocuk"". 

Hope to see you around! Feel free to ask questions.

They were always my biggest hobby, consuming most of my free time, but lately I have had the same free time but more boredom. After World of Warcraft died out for me, no other MMORPG was fun. Call of Duty 4 was the last FPS that was I truly was able to mass hours playing. I moved to strategy games, playing Starcraft 2 for months before the massing games burnt me out as well. I've been in a period where I've been buying games only to become bored of them quite quickly.

Arma III is well rounded with coop, death match, and survival modes. This is the first FPS that I've played in a long time that I'm actually enjoying. Between the graphics, realistic edge over other FPPs, and customization that is allowed with mods, I am having an absolutely blast and the game isn't even out yet! This is the first game that I've played in quite some time where I cannot wait to get home from work to play. Whereas a few months ago, I would have some free time, find myself bored, and then look for a game to play, I am not looking for free time to play Arma.

If you're on the fence about buying this game or maybe just need a further convincing, I highly suggest you pick this game up. It's refreshing to see a community like the one I've been presented with in Arma compared to the communities of popular games like WoW, LoL, and SC2.

Seriously, awesome game. I just felt like spreading my opinion in case anyone feels like reading this.",,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_1k1p7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1k1p7c/arma_iii_has_spurred_some_of_the_most_fun_i_have/,

&gt;This is a busy week for the team. We are pushing hard for the internal milestone mentioned last week, but we have also begun preparing another Alpha and Alpha Lite update (default branch). The exact release timing by means of the second SPOTREP depends on whether we find major showstoppers or not. Meanwhile there have been some cool fixes in the Development branch, which will make it into this update. There are fixes to the simulation of speed of sound and delays for weapons and explosions, as well as the synchronization of character rotations in multiplayer. There has also been a fix in the combat AI, which means groups (who do share target info) will no longer have all members fire on targets which cannot be seen at all.

Hey, I can only dedicate so much time to things that aren't eating and Arma this weekend, so give me a break.

EDIT: This is assuming they haven't updated the default alpha to have a performance upgrade since yesterday.

**BACKGROUND**

Inspired to check out the performance differences (if any) in the developer build from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1a791s/arma_3_dev_build_fps/) post, I decided to fire up the FRAPS and give the two builds a go.

**TESTING METHODS**

Since the maps between the default build and the developer builds are incompatible, and getting multiplayer results will introduce too many uncontrollable variables, I've just decided to do a quickie in the singleplayer editor with an easily duplicatable scenario:

* Spawn player on airfield during daytime with a dozen KA-60 helicopters in front of him.

* Put two full 10-man OPFOR squads in Air Station Mike.

* Put a BLUFOR squad and an OPFOR squad facing each other in Agia Marina and make them ~~kiss~~ fight.

* A mobile team just south of Air Station Mike with an Ifrit.

* Benchmark will last approx. 4 minutes: the player gets into one of the KA-60s, flies to the south of the island and turns north at The Spartan, does one gatling gun strafe on the infantry in Air Station Mike, turns west toward Agia Marina, zoom in on the fight in the town in passing, and then land in the northeast end of the air strip.

**RESULTS**

[**--&gt;Here are the results&lt;--**](http://i.imgur.com/XUryNX8.png)

The top of the graph shows the min, max, and average frames per second for each run. I'd say those are fairly similar. The graph paints a more appropriate picture, as the performance seems to be about the same for both runs.

Even though the average frames per second is slightly higher in the default build, I would say that is a cause of testing error (I probably spent a few seconds longer staring at the sky, for example), than an actual, statistically significant difference.

**CONCLUSION**

Performance is about the same in both builds for this particular test on my particular computer. Other tests on different machines, with different variables, may show a difference, but so far I am seeing none.

Although I did notice that the KA-60's gatling gun in the dev build appears to shoot out more bullets with a larger spread, and with bright green tracers.

if enough people are interested I'll run an ACE and ACRE basics tutorial at 2200 GMT +1 today (09.01.2013). I know it's not announced sufficiently early, but if people like it I'll set up another. If you have trouble setting up your ACE/ACRE PM me between now and the start of the tutorial. I'd also recommend getting shacktac hud (@sthud) as it greatly helps with some shortcomings of sitting in front of the monitor.

I'll go over the following topics:

* Map reading

* Tips&amp;Tricks you might not have known (CQC Sights, freelook and stuff like that)

* Differences between ACE and vanilla and stuff to look out for (backblast, weapon deployment, earplugs and much more)

* Medical System

* CSWs and heavy weaponry (launchers, vehicle mounted weapons)

* Explosives (Satchels and basic explosives)

* and other topics on request (Sniping, advanced explosives)

* basics of ACRE &amp; Tips and Tricks also basic coms hints

* different Radios how to configure them and use them

* hints to further stuff you could look at for ACE/ACRE (proper CFFs for mortars, 9 and 5 lines and obviously all the cool ACE features like artillery, advanced explosives and whatnot)

That's just an offer in case nobody wants/needs to attend I'll still do it on request but not post it here anymore.

We'll do this on a public ACE/ACRE enabled server, depending where people are from. 

Please let me know either here or via PM if you want to attend. Thanks!

---
Update 13.01.2013:
I'll be having another tutorial tonight (13.01.2013 - 14.01.2013) 0000 GMT + 1 (CET). Please let me know if you wish to attend. In case you have any technical trouble you'll be able to find me on the 15thMEU TS server http://www.15thmeu.net/forum/index.php?pageid=ts3_info under the name ""PFC Egger""

&gt; **Some words about Arma 3 ALPHA issues from Your Community Manager**


&gt;Hello new fans and old fans of Arma serie to Arma 3 Alpha , http://www.arma3.com

&gt;please realize Arma 3 alpha game is still in development stage, 
&gt;while quite 'stable and playable' for some yet not enough to be normally playable for others 

&gt;this will be improved with updates to Alpha before even Beta and later Final Full version comes

&gt;note: not even fixes from recent Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead beta builds were merged yet 
&gt;that will happen (if all goes well) later this week (so no point report what was fixed already in OA)

&gt;so if you have crashes, various bugs, Multiplayer issues 
&gt;take your time to write very good report ticket (simpler == better) into our bug tracker 
&gt;http://feedback.arma3.com/
&gt;or wait little for next updates to Alpha which should sort the game-breaking problems

&gt;many might noticed there is no dedicated server binary/data package, 
&gt;that's all WIP (work in progress) and more additions later (like headless client)

&gt;bare with us, the amount of feedback, issues is huge (BI store overload not helped either)
&gt;we will try deal with it as fast as humanly possible

Some of you may be surprised to learn that cars and helicopters and ATVs dont explode after a certain amount of damage is done to their body.

Bullets dont cause explosions. They cause holes.

Even in the cases where you put many bullets into the gas tank of an given vehicle the most you could get is a fireball and a slow burn thereafter. 

However, other games and movies have trained us to assume any source of damage creates explosions in vehicles. This simple isn't true, save for cases where ammo is ignited. 

That said, explosions are fucking cool. So I can see why we may just want to keep them for that sake alone.

What do you think? Should arma be more realistic in this regard? Or keep the ridiculous but awesome notion that all internal combustion engines and jet engines are, in fact, made out of dynamite.

That being said, I am unaware if they have introduced all they are planning concerning the underwater/naval environment. 

Have they mentioned any more ships? Personally, an island the size of Altis would feel pretty bare with nothing but speedboats buzzing in the surrounding water, as current naval engagements on Stratis feel rather unremarkable IMO. Any unique ideas to use what's currently been released? Any unique features you think need to be added to the game?

If you’re interested in joining information can be found at [our website](http://www.clearbackblast.com) or /r/clearbackblast.


**A bit of information about us, however.**


* We believe all Arma groups should be modeled after real life units, so Clear Backblast! is modeled after the 1st Special Forces Marine Division of Liechtenstein. 


* Operations take place every Saturday at 1PDT/4EDT.


* To be as realistic in our approach as possible, sometimes our scheduled missions simply involve standing in the base watching the flagpole for a few hours, and sometimes they just don’t happen at all!


* We use ACE and ACRE, and will train you in any part of Arma you are not already familiar with.


* However, due to recent budget cuts we have had to cut back on training. Yearly trainings are now available, consisting of two twenty minute sessions including, and limited to, the fundamentals of rebinding your ACE interaction keys, and running Teamspeak as an administrator. 


* All future training for Arma 3 was the first thing cut once the budgetary restrictions were announced.


**Experience Arma the CBB way!**


* Our operations feature vehicles with less than half fuel at any given time because we can’t afford to fuel them all the way.


* Full combat loads of ammunition are never more than 4 30-Round magazines.


* Sometimes you might not actually get a gun. 

* Next month we're instituting 2 man fireteams so that we can have more squads - 1 gun per fireteam, once the gunner goes down the next guy picks up the rifle and charges onward.


* Experience new CBB content like our custom mods, most notably @CBB_shitshoveling, part of our flagship mission “Latrine Duty”. 


**Be part of a tight-knit community!**


* We recently (today) instituted a strict rank structure to maintain discipline, and all members are required to use their real names with their titles. In addition, when addressing a superior players are required to salute, lie prone (to show submission), and then address them with their Rank, Name, and various Metals stated in the order of importance. 


* For example: “At attention, Corporal John Edwards, 2X Medal for Supreme Bravery in the Face of Adversity, 42x Purple Heart for super bad shit yo, Bronze League Starcraft 2.""


* Rigorous conditioning is part of our core training, and to emulate this we at CBB have built a culture of bullying and passive aggressiveness, through snide comments about manhood and/or home life. 


**Finally, a few youtube videos of recent missions.**

With something as highly customizable as A3, or even A2, I think its doable if not already in existence.

- Civilian Urban/City environment

- Players all lobby in then spawn together (100-500k radius)

- No starting gear. Scavenge to get basic essentials as you see the North Koreans deploy down in parachutes. You have maybe 5 minutes to gear up and begin the fight.

- Objective would be to eliminate the threat by (1) liberating checkpoints, (2) destroying objectives, (3) securing communications, (4) Final - Escape the warzone/military extraction.

Something that would be challenging in terms of AI force and restricted loot tables in certain stages. Once you liberate objective 1, you can gear up to m16's or AK's. Stage 2 you can acquire military humvees. Stage 3 You acquire communication systems. stage 4, helicopters, etc.

If there is another sub-reddit this would be more appropriate for, or if some mission/mod like this already exists, please let me know.

EDIT: Just to clarify. What I listed above would more or less probably be a scripted mission, but could easily be turned into a gameplay type like what Origins is for DayZ.

1370992786.0,26,self.arma,1g5p4x,Is the AI in ArmA detecting you too quickly or chewing you up with ridiculous accuracy? Look here for how to customize the AI skill and settings.,35,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1g5p4x/is_the_ai_in_arma_detecting_you_too_quickly_or/,"So I've seen a few posts recently about the ridiculous spotting skill and accuracy of the AI in ArmA 3. Since a lot of people around are new to ArmA, I suppose it's not widely known that these things are 100% customizable.

You can separately customize the AI Accuracy and skill from OUTSIDE of the game, but inside the game you can only do their skill. In game is easy. Click Options, then Game, then Difficulty. At this point you can change the difficulty settings for all 4 difficulty levels. NOTE: Higher difficulty levels are hard coded to not allow certain things. I recommend customizing and using the ""Regular"" level for all gameplay. It sets forth no restrictions that I know of.

Now from here you will see that you can set the AI skill, and if I'm not mistaken, their accuracy is the same as their skill. This is extremely unacceptable. I want enemies that think smart and shoot realistically. Not enemies that shoot pinpoint accurate lasers. So you're going to have to edit your username.arma3profile.

Here's how you get there: Click your Start Menu -&gt; Username -&gt; My Documents -&gt; ArmA 3 Alpha - Other Profiles -&gt; Profilename -&gt; Profilename.arma3alphaprofile

Open the Profilename.arma3alphaprofile with notepad or your preferred text editor. Once there, scroll down about 75% of the way until you see the 4 inset difficulty settings. This is what mine looks like:

    class regular
	{
		class Flags
		{
			Armor=1;
			FriendlyTag=1;
			EnemyTag=0;
			MineTag=0;
			HUD=1;
			HUDPerm=0;
			HUDWp=1;
			HUDWpPerm=0;
			HUDGroupInfo=0;
			AutoSpot=0;
			Map=0;
			WeaponCursor=1;
			AutoGuideAT=0;
			ClockIndicator=1;
			3rdPersonView=1;
			UltraAI=0;
			CameraShake=1;
			UnlimitedSaves=1;
			DeathMessages=0;
			NetStats=0;
			VonID=0;
			ExtendetInfoType=0;
		};
		skillFriendly=0.89999998;
		skillEnemy=0.89999998;
		precisionFriendly=0.5;
		precisionEnemy=0.2;

[Here](http://wiki.zspecialunit.org/index.php?title=ArmA_2_Server_Difficulty_Settings) is a site with a good explination of all the above settings.

What you specifically want to look at, however, are the bottom four variables. skillFriendly, skillEnemy, precisionFriendly, and precisionEnemy. As you can see, I have the skill values up to 90%, but the enemy accuracy at 20%. Think it's too low? It's not. The sweet spot for AI accuracy is between 20-30%. You are still going to get shot a lot at 20%, you simply actually have time to react to fire and get cover. If you still think 20% isn't enough, put the values wherever you desire.

Learning to manipulate these settings is game-changing. You will notice a difference in gameplay pacing, tempo, immersion, and playability the second you make the changes. When I first started ArmA I almost quit when I was hit by a dismounted tank crewman from ~600m away that had an AK74SU. That's when I finally realized the issues I was having with the game and actually found these settings.

I hope this helps you guys out and greatly increases the playability of ArmA for you. For years I haven't understood why the AI accuracy is so screamingly high, but now you all know, and can do something about it.

WARNING: If you change your difficulty level settings in-game, the precisionFriendly and precisionEnemy values will reset to default. So if you make any changes via the in-game menu, you must then shut the game down and reset the precision values in the .arma3profile.",,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_1g5p4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1g5p4x/is_the_ai_in_arma_detecting_you_too_quickly_or/,

I will be editing this post with information that can help you to setup your own server.  

Also if you have any information that can help others please comment here.


***Edit*** Make sure that you run the development beta.  you can enable this by right clicking ArmA 3 in steam, go to properties, then select the beta tab, and from the drop down menu select development beta. 

The simple things:
Create a .bat file with the following:

    start """" /affinity 0C ""arma3.exe"" -server -config=server1.cfg -port=2302

This will have ArmA 3 run with a set affinity [change to your liking], to run as a server, which config to load, and which port.

You can add other parameters that have been used in the past, such as -exThreads, -world, etc.  You can also load a custom ""basic.cfg""  for configuring your bandwidth and network settings for ArmA.   I will explain the ""basic.cfg"" at a later time.

You can find examples of these configs here:

""server.cfg""
http://pastebin.com/YWwhXfdS

""basic.cfg""
http://pastebin.com/QvsD7ic7  -testing with this still.

Now place these configs in your arma 3 install directory [server.cfg is the most important, if you don't know about the basic.cfg do not worry about it now]

After you have the config setup, and your bat file ready to go, make sure you have some extra cool awesome missions for the newbs and launch that bat file!     

*note - Steam must installed on the computer and running for ArmA 3 to start, regardless if it is a server or a client.  At this point there is speculation on whether or not this will be the case in the future. I doubt it will be the case as this seems to be the temporary solution for running a dedicated server without proper dedicated files.

A quick workaround is to launch the server, and then sign out of your steam account, or keep it logged in if you don't plan on using the same steam account to play, or pony the fuck up and buy another alpha licence.

NOW!  This does not work 100%,  the dedicated server is liable to crash, and often.  Needless to say, it is a good day 1 work around for running a dedicated server.


I will edit this post over the next few days to expand on building dedicated servers for ArmA 3 Alpha.  I may not be an expert in the field, but I certainly would love to learn the tricks of the trade.  If you have any other tips or you have setup your dedicated host differently I think the community would love to know!


***EDIT*** I found a few fixes for server crashes.  First Disable Windows Error Reporting for windows server

    Program.exe has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please close the program.
    To disable Error Reporting in Windows 2008 Server, just run the command below.
    
    serverWerOptin /disable
    
    I found another guide from MSDN on how the user can suppress system and application error messages from occurring on an embedded system. The registry location is at the following, by default the value data is 0 and we should change it to 2 to set all messages to invisible.
    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Wi ndows\ErrorMode.
    
    Weirdly even after doing all that, it’s still not enough to disable the error window when the game server crashes. So I continue digging and I found that there’s another important registry key which you need to modify in order to totally suppress the “.exe has stopped working” dialog.” Go to the following registry location and change the value data to 1.
    
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI
    
    Now you can run the restarter and it will auto restart when it crashes.

Use this batfile as your auto restarter just ensure your directory paths are correct: 

    ::Made by eRazeri
    @echo off
    :start
    C:\Windows\System32\tasklist /FI ""IMAGENAME eq arma3.exe"" 2&gt;NUL | C:\Windows\System32\find /I /N ""arma3.exe""&gt;NUL
    if ""%ERRORLEVEL%""==""0"" goto loop
    echo Server monitored is not running, will be started now 
    start """" /wait ""C:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3\arma3.exe"" -server -nosound -nosplash  -nopause -config=C:\server.cfg -cpuCount=4 -maxMem=8192 -exThreads=7
    echo Server started succesfully
    goto started
    :loop
    cls
    echo Server is already running, running monitoring loop
    :started
    C:\Windows\System32\timeout /t 10
    C:\Windows\System32\tasklist /FI ""IMAGENAME eq arma3.exe"" 2&gt;NUL | C:\Windows\System32\find /I /N ""arma3.exe""&gt;NUL
    if ""%ERRORLEVEL%""==""0"" goto loop
    goto start

Team Deathmatch / RP


Suggested players 10
Minimum Players 3


Briefing:
1-3 suspects has killed an individual in the town of Agia Marina on Stratis. They arrived by boat on the north side of the island and need to get away from the cops. The cops have access to 1 armored veichle, 1 helicopter (for recon, has no weapons), a couple of offroads and most important: Radios. The cops goal is to kill all the suspects (Stratis courthouse in on strike...) and the crooks goal is to leave the island by boat. If a civilian spots the criminals, they will call the cops.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4s5-ue-GjunYjdURVdsZjNNRTQ/edit?usp=sharing


Wishlist:

* Proper Briefing

* Remove the AI-slots by default

* Sirens / sound for the police cars

* Enhanced speed for police cars

* Able to place mines that just do enough damage to injure and/or disable the criminals wheels (Both for Criminals and Cops (Spikemat / Caltrops)

* Dynamic civilians that will report the criminals (if the criminals shoot the civilians they don't report)

* More range of cars (Will have do wait until Beta / Full Release)

* Police cars / Uniforms

* ""Criminal"" Uniforms

* Change the scenario to a bankrobbery instead (Criminals go to Town X (have several towns to get some element of suprise) and the police is alerted after the robbery)

* Custom Radio sounds

* Be able to capture the criminals alive (Maybe a scoreboard - 10p for kill / 100 for capture)


Misc.
This is my first map that i publish to the public eye and I'm kinda of a n00b when it comes to scripting. Needs some testing (all my Arma-friends is asleep or at work atm...) and lacks alot of features that i want to add. All comments are welcome.

People, including myself, try to board a vehicle using the action-roll menu but last minute that option disappears because we moved our view or the vehicle moved. Now there is a mine beneath the helicopter spawn and no way to disarm it!

It would fit a lot better in the CTRL+G(where you switch between grenades) in my opinion. Not only is it more convenient but you would drastically reduce the number of accidentally placed explosives AND de-clutter the action-roll menu.

precisionFriendly=x.xxxxx; precisionEnemy=x.xxxxx;
there are MULTIPLE entries corresponding to different difficulty levels, These levels have nothing to do with the AI ""Smartness"" slider, but rather the drop down box you choose.
I'm not sure how the number corresponds to accuracy exactly, but the closer to 1 it is, the more aimbot-ish they become.
A funny starter value is 0.05, this value means the AI can't hit the broadside of a barn and instead instantly become stormtroopers, hitting everything but you.
Anyways, tailor this value to your liking and happy hunting.
P.S, someone tell BI devs to add this value to the ingame menu.",,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_19z1gz,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/19z1gz/psatutorial_arma_3_make_those_bots_less_aimbotlike/,

When i used to join servers and someone would hack the host would always say ""i'll check the scripts to find out who it was"" and then he all of a sudden knows who did it...  A little background:  I host the server through TA2DST on Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.  The mission is Takistan Life and it is a dedicated server.  Thanks guys.

I made my way to the highground on the right and noticed a small building witha  truck and a number of opfor around the area. At the hill I was on were 2 OPFOR on the road. I opened fire but only hit one before getting shot, I got up and ran down the hill. 

I used the bushes to approach the well lit building and transport truck. I guess the AI really cant see through bushes. I got up close and chucked 2-3 grenades into a group of people and sprinted to the truck and drove off.

On the map was a ""road block"" so I went there. I dont know if this is new, but the AI doesnt magically know you are BLUFOR if you are in an OPFOR vehicle! Which is *awesome*. I came up on them and proceeded to run over about 10 people. They start to shoot after 1-2 (as if you were OPFOR also) but they couldnt stop me! After that I switched to and ifrit and ran some more people over on the way to the lighthouse. There were 3 there in a tight group so I dismounted and mowed them down with my gun and blew up the tower. 

Finally I drove down to the AA site and ran over atleast 10 more people, their grenades were no match for me! I slowly squished the last one and was told to exfil. A simple matter with my truck, which I broke about 30m away from exfil. And done!

It was a lot of fun! It seems the AI has been very much improved in accuracy and knowing where you are and those sorts of things. It makes ambushes on AI much more effective.

I've recently purchased Arma 2 and have played around in the editor, on a server with a few friends, but I have yet to be involved with any big events.

So, here is my proposition, in a few weeks time, we have a large Arma community get together. We would agree on a (rough) time from when it will start to when it will end, and during this time we co-ordinate to play on specific servers together, we could encourage as many people as possible before hand to purchase the game and see how big an event we can make this.

EDIT 2: I'm still interested in a Vanilla Arma get together, so if anybody has a server, or knows someone who does, and can host some games, please PM me.

EDIT: Ok, it is apparent that these get togethers are actually quite common, but most of them use the ACE2 and ACRE mods.

I've spent more than enough time in ArmA 2 and ArmA 3 with AI drivers and so far I was a little disappointed with how AI soldiers would drive vehicles. In multiple cases had I seen unneeded deaths because the AI would ram its Humvee through the infantry's path.

But after spending thirty minutes with the UGV's I'm absolutely stunned. I was afraid I had to set a waypoint at every curve in a curved road so it wouldn't crash into the guardrails or dirt, but it isn't even necessary.

 I started out in Agia Marina, got in the cargoseat of my trusty NATO UGV and set a waypoint at the Kamino Firing Range- just ONE waypoint- and it drove me there. I didn't have to do a thing. It was even better than the driving I'd seen from most human players.

Props to Bohemia for this, the UGV is the coolest feature I've seen so far, and I love it.

PS: Screw around in the editor pretending the UGV is K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider and let it pick you up, get in the back seat and then let it drive you around. It's awesome.",,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_1kjnxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1kjnxg/concerning_the_ugv_stomper/,

Firstly, the AI crashes helis a lot.  They fly into each other, they fly into trees and they hit radio masts.  This is rather irritating.

Secondly, in my attempts to create a basic mission where I have a heli assault on a location in Arma 3, using a unload waypoint followed by a seek and destroy waypoint, I have this issue where the AI switches to seek and destroy before the soldiers in the heli are actually unloaded.

Unloading men from a heli takes forever.  They open the side door, get out and then close it for every single soldier.  

The ghosthawk also lacks a SAM warning and the AI is unable to use countermeasures against OPFOR SAMS.  If you have an AA soldier, he will take down 2 ghosthawks.  The AI also prioritises killing transports over killing attack helis.

Helis have also shown truly bizarre behaviour while executing an unload waypoint.  In my mission I had a group of helis flying in from the ocean to the northeast of Stratis down to the Air station.  They would each be given an unload waypoint around the station.  Sometimes the helis would unload at the given position, other times though they completely overshoot their given location, fly all the way to the abandoned FoB and land on its helipad.

Our casualty collection point was stacking up and we needed to do something fast. So we called in a Super Cobra to lay the hurt and cover our retreat to regroup. My squad threw all the smoke grenade we had and with only 1 Humvee active out of the whole ordeal we retreated to a house in the outskirt of the AO. Next thing we did was wait for a LAV and pushed back into town and with the help of both Super Cobra and LAV we finally took the town. ,,False,self,t5_2s3q7,False,,,True,t3_tgqg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/tgqg5/reddit_what_is_your_best_or_most_crazy_moment_in/,

FROM: Project Lead
TO: Beta Users
INFO: Patch released, Dev branch highlights, Early release prep
PRECEDENCE: Flash
SITUATION

After last week's release of the second large Beta patch, we are now storming towards what is likely our last patch opportunity ahead of release. The goal for that patch is still to include the second content package (sporting various aerial and ground-based drones), as well as Workshop support. The latter is ready to release from a technical point of view, but we are getting the publication side set up with our partners at Valve. Read more about how the final stages of development and patching will work further on in this report. Oh, and later in the week we should have the first episode of a new season of Community Guide videos ready for you; a spectacular look at rotary wing flight!
INTELLIGENCE

The Artwork tab on the Arma 3 Steam Community Hub has been enabled. Show us and the rest of the world some of your cool Armart!

The deadline for submitting details for the Supporter Edition credits has ended. We are doing final checks on the submissions and are integrating them into the game. For those unaware: the first 2500 purchasers of this edition will be seeing their name in the credit listing - as a thanks for their investment into Arma development.

Development branch has been seeing some rather sizable improvements recently. There's been work done on a new style collision envelope (for characters with rifles only at the moment). Helping with issues like clipping, sticking and general handling, the animation team is continuing to do apply fixes. Most recently going up steep stairs has been tweaked. Other changes target the flight models of helicopters (more below), and there's been a cool change to the RPG42's sights and implementation. Give it a go if you don't mind the risks and frequent data transfers on dev branch.

We've officially announced our attendance of the Gamescom expo in Germany this year. Go hands-on with one of the Arma 3 Release Candidate iterations - including Altis, Main Battle Tanks and new showcases. DayZ Standalone will also be available, showing off the improvements since E3.

Our colleagues are releasing the next entry into the Take On series this Thursday! Take On Mars will be available via Steam's Early Access for all aspiring Mars Rover engineers, and can be pre-ordered via our Store!
OPERATIONS

A while ago we disabled rain because we were not satisfied with the graphical state. In the meantime, we've investigated some options for improving it, and identified a modest set of refinements we hope to include for the final game. A more significant overhaul is desired, but we're rather saturated with other tasks right now.

Task Force ROFLcopters, comprised of virtual pilots like Ondřej Kužel and Ivan Buchta, spotted several slow-moving helos on the horizon and decided to re-tweak them. New parameters were added thanks to joint effort of Vojtěch Hladík and Petr Kolář. It is no longer needed to handle distribution of mass in the model, and hope for better reasons by shifting a few pounds around the vehicle. Some issues have arisen while using strange values - beware of AI getting into endless spirals upwards while tweaking your own helicopter. This still has to be disposed of by moving the center of mass.
LOGISTICS

Moving into the final stages of development for the Q3 release will have impact on our patching cycle and Development branch updates. More details are going to be announced, but in general: we need to stop patching the default Beta branch at some point. One reason is the re-skinning of the game from Beta to full release. Once we start this, we cannot easily keep the Beta updated. Therefore, after the release of the third patch, further changes will only be made available on dev branch (some of which you will welcome with open arms - without a doubt!). The first update of default branch after point in time is to be the game release.

Internally we are going to also apply what we refer to as 'data locks'. Hated by many of the team's developers, they are a necessary evil to be able to assure quality of the critical Q3 release. We cannot continue development right up until release day. Every little change has the potential to affect other parts of the game. No realistic amount of testing can cover this effectively. The data lock means our developers focus entirely on testing and fixing critical issues that prevent release. Every change needs to be authorized before it gets accepted into the Release Candidate. Then, after a hopefully successful release, we continue to a fairly similar pattern of patches and daily dev branch updates.

The 3D zoom scopes are almost unusable,22,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/1gtt0s/anyone_here_on_dev_buildbeta_use_trackir_or/,"This was my greatest fear when they introduced the 3D scopes, but I thought, ""Nah, they'd totally just lock the view to the scope! They wouldn't completely disregard those with headtracking!""

Alas, no.

Since EVERYTHING is zoomed in, my head movements are greatly accentuated. Every tiny movement of my head now moves the view away from the scope, making it almost impossible to play now. 

I tried doing the combined arms showcase, but all that succeeded in doing was make me dizzy and give me a sore neck (because I stiffen it to keep my head from moving even a centimeter in any direction).

If you use head-tracking, please show your support for this issue:

http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=9816

Also, if you're wondering about the helicopter HUDs and how they're always centered on your screen even if you're looking away... no, that has not been fixed. Even the new gunships are hard to use because you never know exactly where you'll be firing.

In reality, the pilots could adjust the tilt of the rotor assembly, and the tilt of the blades themselves. That sparked the idea to make a list of some changes to helicopters that could benefit ArmA III:

• Add the ability to change the pitch of the rotor assembly so that wheeled helicopters can taxi (helicopters with skids could have this feature, but would not be able to taxi)

• Add cargo helicopters (like the CH-53) and the ability to lift cars and light armor (like HMMWVs and LAV-25s)

• Add the ability to repel out of troop transport helicopters (like to UH-60 and the UH-1Y)

• Add better rotorwash (like when a helicopter lands on sand, I want to see a lot of sand being kicked up)

There are a couple things though that affect gameplay in an negative way for me and I would like to see them fixed/reduced/eliminated. This is just a list of specific things aside from obvious glitches we're all aware of and content. 

1. The basic control scheme is fine and the stances are adequate as well, though I think (like someone here said) that using the scroll wheel in tandem with Ctrl is a better way of adjusting stances. 

2. On the subject of stances, a stance indicator would be nice. Especially on servers that have 3rd person view disabled. 

3. Terrain doesn't seem to affect movement much. I can sprint up very steep inclines without tiring. I think sprinting in itself is too fast and needs to be either slowed down or more limited (affected by terrain and what not). ACE should take care of this to an extent. 

4. The distance LOD textures aren't that great and trees tend to look highlighted against the scenery. It should be able to be improved easily enough as mods in Arma 2 and even OFP have demonstrated. 

5. Optimizations. We can all agree on this one. 

6. Deployable bipods (probably with ACE)/ability to set range on various weapons.  

7. Improvements to the AI. This should be a basic, ongoing thing. We can see the huge improvements to AI in Arma 3 as compared to Arma 2 but it's not ""good enough"" yet. 

8. Humanizing the AI a bit. It'd be nice if you could see them sitting down or possibly talking when you sneak up on them. Now they just stand perfectly still like robots facing the direction they were spawned in to face.

And this is where my problem starts.  I have noticed that the climb and descent rate with the stick is about half that of when I am pressing the button on the keyboard.

This is not because of shared input, I have unmapped the keyboard bindings with no improvement.

So the question is, how do I get the controller to give full rather than half input?

I enjoy the milsim aspects of ArmA 3 but sometimes I agree with them that I wish it included a sort of 'casual' mode for when I'm not particularly into dealing with the difficulty. They get frustrated by the way they get killed without being able to see enemies. And although I've gotten better at using cover and moving carefully, I can sympathize with them coming from a game with less of a curve like Battlefield.

Is there any chance of a mod that could add Battlefield style spotting and a radar? I think if we just had that ability I could convince them to give it more of a chance.
