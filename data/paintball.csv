1371140414.0,127,self.paintball,1g9xke,Why I will NEVER endorse a GoG gun.,164,37,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1g9xke/why_i_will_never_endorse_a_gog_gun/,"People sometimes ask me why I have a problem recommending GoG guns. I think it's a fair question that deserves an answer.

Short version: The company is run by scummy people to whom I hate giving money.

Longer version: GoG is owned by Adam and Billy Gardner who formerly owned Smart Parts. Smart Parts made many iconic parts and guns over the years including:

 - All-American barrels

 - Freak Barrels

 - Max-Flo regulators

 - The Shocker in all its variants

 - The Ion

 - The SP-1

 - The Vibe

 - The Impulse and more

In 2006 Smart Parts filed a class-action lawsuit which was more or less aimed at the paintball industry. Because they had contracted the first electropneumatic paintball gun (the Shocker, made by PVI and Ed Hensel), they felt that everyone else who used a solenoid valve and an electronics board in a gun should pay them royalties for each gun produced. Sudden shitstorm.

Up until this point every major technological breakthrough for paintball had been public domain. Tippmann came up with the idea to use Schraeder valves in tanks as a means of safe delivery of air to the gun and safe storage. Glenn Palmer came up with the mechanics to make a semi-automatic guns a reality. Tom Kaye of AGD introduced High Pressure Air to the market as an alternative to CO2. Lee Kirwan introduced a way of making o-rings work in valves that made spool valves infinitely more flexible. None of them asked for royalties. Additionally, all these companies had done these innovations themselves.

[The following is a summation provided by user HP_Lovecraft on the MCB forums who says it much better than I can. There's actually a lot more specific useful info in the thread linked:](http://www.mcarterbrown.com/forums/dead-zone/178725-dr-hensel-pvi-cyber-9000-sp-wdp-patent-battle-history.html)

""*The short version was that SP hired PVI to design, and build an electronic gun. SP would be the distributor.*

*Neither party was happy with the arrangement, so PVI split to sell a newer version through other distributors. SP was not happy. So they told their dealer network they are not allowed to sell, or even talk with PVI. This was substantial because everyone sold SP barrels. They were huge back then.*

*And PVI went out of business. The bank took everything, and sold it cheap at auction. Including intellectual property rights (ie patents, designs, etc). Here SP bought up the patent, design, equipment, etc. They went on to produce the Shocker 4x4. But the Shocker 4x4 was a grand failure. By now, far, far better guns had hit the market, ie Angel, Bushmaster, Tribal, even Rainmaker.*

*So used the PVI patent and revised it to be far more general, and then hit the entire competition with patent lawsuits. As we all know, most companies folded. Either paying royalties, or stopping production. All except WDP. They had the money to properly fight SP.*

*And they discovered something interesting- PVI (and its bank) was only partial owner of the patent. PVI hired Professor Hensel to do the original design work. For payment, he was given part of the design rights. SP only bought the PVI ""half"". WDP quickly contacted Hensel, and managed to buy up the other half of the patent.*

*That crushed SP. From that point they were no longer able to sue over the electro patent. In court, the Judge even noted that SP claims were fairly suspicious to begin with as they were never involved in the research, design, and development stages.*""

When Smart Parts went out of business a few years ago, people were initially excited in a sort of ""Ding dong the witch is dead"" sort of way. Rumors were, however, that Adam and Billy had somehow, even though the bank sold all the intellectual property rights, been able to buy up all the old designs and patents at auction under another name. People began to realize that Smart Parts is like a goddamn mythical Hydra, where you cut off one head and 7 more spring up.

Suddenly GoG appeared. The sum of all fears. SP-1? Now it's the G-1. Oh god they've renamed the Ion and the Vibe, too. They're literally identical to the Smart Parts counterparts. The company is still owned by the Gardners. **I will never support the Gardners by buying any of their products.** I realize the Envy and Exctsy are good beginner guns from a product standpoint, but I will not support that company under any circumstances. They singlehandedly butchered the industry due to greed. Fuck SP. Fuck GoG. Fuck the Gardners and everything they touch.",,False,,t5_2qkm6,False,,,True,t3_1g9xke,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1g9xke/why_i_will_never_endorse_a_gog_gun/,

About mid day, someone on the American side attacked a pill box and relentlessly overshot the two people trapped inside, my two friends and teammates at their first scenario. The ref had to come up and pull the guy away to get him to stop shooting. Later in the day, the same guy decided to end the day with overshooting a friend here in the attached picture. His arm was covered in blood and yellow paint and his Rotor was blasted to shreds from this guy. After this incident he fled the field.

Last Sunday he was wearing a blue jersey with white lettering and stripes and black speedball pants. He was using a blue marker with a silver barrel. 

If anyone who was at the scenario,frequents PAP, or any area players that know who this guy is or know of anyone who matches this description with a penchant for overshooting, please help us find him so we can stop him from coming to these events ruining the sport for everyone else. Thanks.

Most of it is common sense, some may not be expected. Being prepared will make your day awesome and you'll be able to help other players, which will make their day awesome. I'm also hopped up on coffee right now and typing at 15 bps. 

* Water. Don't get dehydrated and die. That sucks.
* More water. Share with the poor schmucks that didn't bring any.
* Batteries. Having the correct ones for your gun/hopper helps. I like going to BatteriesPlus and buying sticks of 9vs to keep in my gear bag.
* Rags. You want two kinds. Random shop rags for wiping paint off your gun &amp; clothes, and microfibers for your mask. Bring lots of microfibers to share with people. Rental players LOVE when you help them clean their mask. Seriously. 
* Anti-fog spray. 'nuff said. 
* Barrel swabs. A stick and a piece of cloth works in a pinch. Or a branch from a pine tree. 
* Paint caddy. These things are great. You will never spill paint trying to pour from a bag again. Slap some stickers on there look like a pro. MAD CRED HHHHHH
* Snacks on snacks. I bring 8 different flavors of cereal every time I play.
* Cooler + Ice. Keep your paint cool on hot days. Keep your water cool. Keep your snacks cool. Keep your cool.
* A good attitude. Nobody likes playing with a douchebag. 
* Spare gun, tank, and hopper. If you can afford it. If you end up not using it, you can always loan it out to someone who is having trouble with theirs. That makes people happy. 
* More water. Just in case. 
* Tools, tape, and lube. Fix stuff. ??? Profit. 
* A smile. :)
* Rope. you never know when you need rope. 
* Clean clothes to put on after playing. Or dirty clothes. I don't care. Wear a burlap sack for all I care. 
* First Aid kit. Patch people up if they get hurt. Which is unlikely. Paintball is super safe.

I got in touch with Raza - they seemed to be the best deal and quality for the jerseys. They got back to me right away. Here's what they said:

&gt;Hi nerfwarhero,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for contacting us for your jersey needs.
&gt;
&gt;We would love to help you and your forum out with a custom jersey. For orders this large, we generally comp the design for free with a $500 deposit. Once the design is complete, you have two options, you can either place the order yourself and handle the shipping, OR we can create a custom web store and handle it all for you. If we create the web store we would refund the $500 deposit once we had reached $2000 in sales.
&gt;
&gt;Cost per jerseys for the TM2 would be $60 + $10 for name/number.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know when you are ready to get started.

SO! what I need from you, r/paintball is if you're a good graphic designer and want to help out, go [here](http://www.razalife.com/paintball/templates) and add the TM2 template to your cart, and check out. They'll then e-mail you the template for the jersey and you can get to work designing a jersey in illustrator CS5 or later in vector format. Please then message me an imgur link to a .jpg of your design, or post it here. I'll make a post **next Wednesday** of all of the designs and you can vote on them reddit style. If we can't agree on a design, or we haven't produced one at all, they have offered to do the design for us for free.

**YOU HAVE UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY AT 12 NOON EASTERN TIME TO SUBMIT DESIGNS**

**tl;dr:** We're getting jerseys. They're going to be $60 (+$10 if you want name and number). If you want to help design it, go read the whole thing. If you want to vote on the design, check back next Wednesday for my post.

Thank everyone for the GREAT ideas and encouragement!  Just hearing your kind words, probably did more for me than him.

For that reason, I created for /r/paintball a comprehensive playlist of paintball videos tips, tricks, suggestions. 

[Here are the playlists:](http://www.youtube.com/user/reubadoob/videos?view=1)


* Social Paintball's Newb School
* Thomas Taylor Pro Tips
*  Planet Eclipse 2 Minute Drills (As of 24 NOV 2012)
* Planet Eclipse Artifact Season 3
* Planet Eclipse Artifact Season 2 (Complete)
* Planet Eclipse Artifact Season 1 (Complete)
* Nicky Cuba Pro Training
* Todd Martinez Pro Paintball Training
* Todd Martinez Pro School
* Sonny Lopez Pump Paintball Tactics
* Paintball Tips &amp; Tricks (MISC videos from TechPB, Ollie Lang &amp; Planet Eclipse)

I hope this helpful for the /r/paintball community and those hoping to learn more about paintball.  

Moderators feel free to add it to the sidebar menu if you deem it worthy.

I will continue to update the playlists and update this thread as they are added. Thanks &amp; Enjoy! ",,False,,t5_2qkm6,1353762234.0,,,True,t3_13pnqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/13pnqx/paintball_for_the_visual_learner/,

[Text/rant post, please actually read]",64,12,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1cav4i/why_all_the_hate_and_banter_textrant_post_please/,"Hello r/paintball, while this ideally is intended to be a short post. I feel that I may make it longer. 


Usually the paintball community here and all over is fantastic and I know that you are all respectful to one another. The problem seems to lie at the fields, I don't get what seems to be the issue with people these days but there has been a lot of hate on certain markers or play styles at my fields. I've happen to notice that more than anything there is hate on the markers. Minis over A5, Egos over Geos blah blah blah. That's not the point, the problem I have is that its not a friendly little banter that we all do it's the actual hurtful insults towards one another.


Should it not matter what we use or how we play. Each and every marker from a die hard Milsim A5, TGR2 or Dye DAM; to a Geo2, LV1, Mini or G6R; what about the Auto mags and pumps. Each and every marker is fantastic in their own way and each marker can and will have perks and cons to it.  Why should you get cussed and insulted into oblivion for using it. Daily I will always overhear some 12 yr old bashing other players for what they use, and its not just the younger ones, I've seen a lot of adults do it too (I'm 20 so right in between). Like really are we not all out there to have fun and enjoy the day shooting each other? While friendly competitive banter is okay in some areas, things escalate fairly fast and that's where feelings get hurt. 

Personal story. Was playing indoor rec ball with my out dated and slightly aged Smart Parts Ion (still have 2) two guys with brand new Ego 10s and Geos decided to bash me. Instead of bantering them back I just said ""whatever"" and went and played. I let my marker do the talking and talking did it do. Not only was it able to keep up with newer electros, it out performed in some areas. and the dudes with the Ego and Geo? yeah they left shortly after being waxed, I didn't say anything. Just continued to play and enjoy myself. 

Point?: Let the markers do the talking, not your mouth. You only end up making yourself look like an ass. Females, Males we all are a little competitive. But do we really have to do it to the point of hurting someone else? Paintball helps you release stress (okay for me it does) do we really need to create more. 

Redditors of paintball. I ask that should you overhear some little more than friendly banter going on, please ask the smack talker to tone it down. It creates a better atmosphere for the game. Even 1 person a day or game will makes things better. 


tl:dr? Go back up and read dammit. Put a lot of heart into this post. :)


Thanks Reddit, down or upvote how ever you feel. Now off to play a night game with my TGR2!

Last night, despite security being present, person or persons unknown broke into the Millennium site in Puget and destroyed two fields of bunkers &amp; large parts of the netting systems. This cowardly and unprovoked attack will not affect this week’s event as The Millennium has always had contingency to deal with damaged equipment, normally expected due to bad weather not sabotage. However, it will mean the Millennium staff having to work through the night to rebuild &amp; replace the damaged equipment, but rest assured The Millennium as always will provide a world class event despite this setback.
In all the years of holding events throughout Europe, we have never had such an incident which is clearly designed to undermine the series for whatever reason. This incident is now under Police investigation and The Millennium will offer a generous reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible.
At the end of the day nobody gains from such actions, it affects the teams, sponsors and all participants. It is a very sad state of affairs that some people in our industry feel that this is an acceptable way to behave.
Security will be vastly increased with the assistance of the local Police &amp; Mayor’s office for the remainder of the set up and event itself.
Any information received will be treated in the strictest confidence and with gratitude.

1366474532.0,50,self.paintball,1cqw6w,This is the New Player FAQ I think most players have actually read before playing.,54,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1cqw6w/this_is_the_new_player_faq_i_think_most_players/," Okay folks, this is written as an introductory guide for beginning players who have no clue what they're doing.  I worked as a referee in the sport for about four years and have played for over ten, and that has given me a wealth of knowledge on the subjects of developmental players and how to properly grow newbies into ferocious killers.

I'm going to walk you through a typical paintball experience, from the very start to the very end.  Hopefully this will answer any and all of your questions, so here goes:

You start your adventure in the magical land of the parking lot.  If you have a gun, now is probably a good time to wave it around at everyone you see and point it at your unarmed friends.  Feel free to brag about how awesome your Spyder is, and double bragging rights are awarded to anyone who has a double trigger.  That's borderline professional-grade equipment you have there, cherish it.  While brandishing your Spyder around the parking lot, also please dry fire a few times to hear the nice loud noises it makes.  Ignore the referees if they yell at you to stop, because you aren't going to hurt anyone anyway.  You're smarter than that.

If you don't have a gun, now is probably a good time to start loudly talking about how much Call of Duty you play and how you're going to shoot everyone in the face.  Even if you've never handled anything resembling a firearm in your life, let alone fired it, rest assured that your hours spent on the XBox will not go to waste.  It's basically the same thing, except easier because your opponent can't screenwatch you and you don't lag.

You'll pay for admission in whatever manner your field of choice so designates, in my experience this was at a trailer located at the main gate to the fields.  Since field paint is really expensive, overpriced even, it's a solid plan to go to Walmart and buy a case or two of Monster-brand ammunition before you come.  This paint is basically the same thing as what the field is selling, so there's no point paying more for the same.  Try to sneak in your non-field paint through creative and ingenious methods including the time-tested classic, ""Oh hey man I don't got no non-field paint.""  If for some unknowable reason they decide to look in your bag anyway, take care to hide your paint in pods.  They'll never think to look in there.

Now it's time, if you haven't brought your own gun, to receive your rental equipment.  You'll have received a number on your wristband, which allegedly correlates to a rental gun in the line of guns set up in the window next to you.  However, using the number system is for idiots and it's a good idea to just scream your number loudly and look confused before abruptly grabbing a gun at random.  If anyone should accost you about this, make sure to put on your best thousand-yard stare and look right through them.  These guys probably aren't paid enough to care too much about what gun you're actually using, anyway.  If you were foolish and purchased your own paint, now is a good time to throw the box on the table next to you and start to fill your gun with ammunition.  Ignore the referees that look irritated that you have apparently interrupted their cleaning or distribution of some sort of equipment, since this table is only intended for your immediate convenience.  You might wish to stock up on paint grenades and a camouflage jumpsuit, available at the rental and admissions trailer, since these are two gamechanging tactical advantages over your foes.  I cannot stress enough that grenades and the jumpsuit will make you a significantly better player from the very start.

You will probably be shooed from the table by some lazy referees who want your table for themselves.  It is at this point that, most likely, you will be ushered towards the woods where the rest of the walk-on players are being rallied and have set up.  No matter what, you do not want to go in the woods, those people are unclean.  If you ask insistently enough, the referees will eventually let you take one of the nice tents that are reserved for private groups.  It doesn't even matter if you don't have 20 people: just ask enough and you can be your own group, all four of you, and you will get your own group, tent, head ref, and special treatment.

Chances are, though, you'll end up in the woods and you should pout about this.  Make sure to ask loudly where to get air, and then ask if you can go to the target range to shoot.  At any point at all, feel free to pull the trigger, like a lot, to make sure your gun is working.  Only do this if your gun is loaded and has air, however, otherwise you won't know if it really works.  You can also take your barrel plug off the gun whenever you want, especially to look down the barrel.  Make sure to wear your stupid face when a referee comes screaming and sprinting towards you.

Soon you will begin to play, which is great! Yay! Bring every question you may have, no matter how insignificant, to the head referee.  He will be happy to answer you as well as bend the rules to whatever you and your friends want to do.  If he says no, ask him a lot.  If he still refuses, get angry and ask to become a private group.

A referee will probably try to explain the rules to you, so now is the perfect time to resume talking about how awesome you are at Call of Duty, and loudly admire the fields.  The proper terminology, by the way, is ""maps"" or ""levels.""    Once rules have been explained, you will be asked to separate into armbands and no armbands.  That thing on your wrist is part of your arm, but you also probably have no idea what an armband is.  Make sure to ask the referee loudly about it, preferably while he's talking to someone else.

Once you go on the field, take your barrel plug off the gun before you go on the field, and leave your mask off to maximize visibility.  You're going to want to scout out the field before you start the game, and this tactical advantage of uninhibited sight will truly propel you to victory later.  For now, however, take a few test shots at some piece of cover.  You want to make sure, yet again, your gun is working.  With the game about to start, you should probably put your mask on finally.  Proper mask placement is determined by having the visor end nearest towards your chin, with the pointy part that looks like a chin up towards your forehead.  You should also find an experienced player who looks like they're busy planning with some other experienced player, and show him that you are a tactically-minded and skilled individual who can contribute to the team.  The best way to accomplish this is to say words like ""flank,"" ""suppress,"" and ""snipe"" in any combination you want.  Using those words will sufficiently impress the other players and let them know that you are a force to be reckoned with.

The game will start soon, which means you should start running and shooting the second the countdown begins.  After the referees restart the game, you must now find a place to start playing! If you're smart, you'll stay in the starting bunker and snipe.  After all, your Call of Duty experience has made you an expert sniper, and you've even played that level with the wind and bullet drop.  You're more than qualified for short-range sniping like this.  Shoot indiscriminately at anything that moves, and even moreso at what does not move.  A sound tactical choice is to blindfire like in Gears of War, although the referees will get upset at you for being too good and will tell you to stop.  Stay in one place the entire game, and chances are you'll win.  If the impossible should happen, however, and you become the last man standing, stay exactly where you are and keep doing what you're doing.  When you are eventually told to surrender by a flaking player, it is appropriate and intelligent to start shooting them.  Keep going until you are ejected from the game.

When the other player gets angry at you, rip off your mask mid-game and go to hit him in the face with your gun.  Fight until you are sufficiently ejected, at which point you should loudly complain about how much bullshit this fucking field is and how you're never coming back again.

Congratulations! You've successfully made it through a game of paintball! Feel free to continue this to your heart's content.  Here are a few other tips to help you out:

-When your mask fogs up, grab some of your shirt, crouch behind something, and take off your mask and clean it.  You're safe where you are.
-Surrender rule is a suggestion.
-Grenades are the most useful thing you can buy.
-The more gear, the more professional they are.
-Call paint check whenever you totally hit someone.  Don't describe the player or his location at all, but instead repeat paint check over and over again.  You totally shot him if you think you did.  The referee is just lazy.
-The front trailer will screw you with gun rentals.  If your gun is misfiring, scream at a referee until he fixes it.  Forcefully insist that sticks were poking out of the barrel when you got it.
-Goggles are optional.  So are barrel plugs in the staging area.
-Pod belts are a waste of money.  Put paint in your pockets instead.
-Pick paint up off the ground, it's like recycling.  The really big balls near puddles are even better.
-Keep playing until a referee calls you out.  Fuck the honor system.
-Always argue with the referees.  The customer is always right.
-Never listen to rules or safety briefings. This stuff isn't complicated, you can figure it out.
-Complain to the boss. Always.
-Hold your gun sideways to shoot better.
-Longer barrel = better.  A 3 foot long barrel is deadly.
-Rapid fire is the way the professionals do it.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST:

You are the best player on the field, most likely.  You know better and should be treated as such. Assert that whenever possible, since you are always right!

Enjoy!

1365518926.0,47,self.paintball,1bzpdi,RANT Post - Got lit up by kid shooting PSP Ramp Unlimited at point blank in the back,62,15,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1bzpdi/rant_post_got_lit_up_by_kid_shooting_psp_ramp/,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Was messing around on the field, it's milsimmy but lots of speedballers play there. I was shooting my inconsistant ebladed super stock and was taking pitty on the renters, 1 shotting them in the leg, not over shooting them, etc etc. I have good trigger control, so I shoot a few, they don't back up, shoot a few again. I get to their side of the field and I clear out their home bunker, As I'm dodging paint from my teammates and the enemy shooting at me now at their home, this one kid I swore I shot out, sneaks around behind me and lays 15 shots just around my kidney area. I look at him and yell WTF. I drop like a sack of rocks into the fetal position covering my head as the game is still going. I'm screaming obscenities just to control the pain. After a few minutes of just laying there, I get up and limp off the field. 

Later on I found out that the kid ( about 10 ), just got the mini and set it to psp ramp uncap. Previous games before I started to play, he was lighting people up after they stop and put their hand up. 

I'm guessing the kid likes to over shoot people on psp ramp. 

I was sitting in the staging area and the dad forces the kid to ask if I'm okay, he looks at me with this big grin and asks if I was okay. Clearly this kid had zero sympathy for me since he clearly thinks it's hilarious he practically shot an entire rope at about 4 feet into my squishy fatty backside right near my kidneys. I looked at the dad and told him he needs to learn trigger control or else people will mess him up if he continues to overshoot people that are out. 

The rage I was feeling to set my gun at uncap psp to just light the side of this little smirky kid's head was fueling so hard. I wanted to shoot him until he was crying and bleeding on the ground was so god damn badly. Downvote me for wanting to destroy a little kid with zero empathy that had no respect for the rules and no common sense. 

If I see this kid again, I'm going to destroy him. 

**TL;DR**

10 year old Kid shooting psp ramp unlimited (we checked his gun) shot me at around 4 feet right into my kidneys and back and did not have any remorse to the damage even if I had been a little kid. I will get revenge If I see this kid again.

I'm stoked for all the interest! I'm working with the guy right now on getting a sample so we can see the finished product before ordering. Per the last attempt at having these made, they'll be $??

You would think that I would hate it being as underemployed as I am, But I don't, I LOVE the sport of paintball and I will tell you why. . . . 

The comradery; When you develop a bond with certain people, and they become your teammates, You immediately develop a trust that is rarely found anywhere else. When I tell my teammate ""Run to the 50, I WILL cover you. "" They KNOW that I am going to do my damnedest to put them there. . .  

The Adrenaline; I, personally, have never been in a real fire fight. . . Hell, I haven't even HELD an ACTUAL gun in 10+ years, BUT I would imagine that paintball is about as close you as you can get to it with out putting your life in actual danger. The amount my blood begins to pump as I start counting down from 5 in my head and then I hear that ""GO GO GO!"", or when it's down to just you against 3 opponents  is understood by few, and will be experienced by even fewer. . . 

FINALLY and most certainly not least. . . 

The mental clarity. . . When I am on that field, Snap shooting against an opponent, the last things on my mind are how shitty my work week was, how much money I have in my bank account, or even how soul crushingly lonely I am. . . The ONE and ONLY thing on my mind is shooting out that person who is trying to shoot me out. It is almost as if time slows down, Everything happens in slow motion, You can see the individual paintballs in a rope right before you snap out to shoot back, screaming out the locations of opponents to your teammates, while listening to them shout out locations of guys you didn't know were there. . . 

AND THAT is the biggest reason as to why I play and LOVE the sport of paintball! ! !",,False,,t5_2qkm6,False,,,True,t3_wj8uv,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/wj8uv/why_do_i_love_paintball/,

Nor is this my plea to be involved in the sub, just some choppy thoughts and ideas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I love paintball, like the rest of you all here, but, I feel that this sub is kind of falling short on what it could be. I feel like we could, as a community, make this sub *the place* to be on reddit for an awesome paintball experience. People should want to come here to be entertained, discuss, and have a good time.

First off, I want to talk a bit about the posts that are commonly on the subreddit. I have absolutely *no* issue with seeing GPs and new players looking for questions and wanting to learn about our glorious sport. The problem is, that is almost entirely what is being put up on the sub. Whenever I get on reddit, I debate whether or not to check this sub because sometimes, there is absolutely nothing interesting going on. I feel that, as a player, I should always want to be checking on this sub no matter what. I know that this may be caused by the small amount of people here, but come on, 5700 people can provide more content than me do now!

I also want to talk about the subreddit in general. It might be nice to have more links in the sidebar, have a badass banner that shows off all types of paintball and some sick custom flair. It would be neat to have a little Planet Eclipse or Empire symbol next to our names. 

I think most of the problems we have here are caused by lack of participation (I'm not saying I provide tons of content or anything of the sort). I think it would be great to have more monthly contests like the action pic one. Possibly sexiest gun, play of the month, video of the month, or whatever you guys want, just so we can get the ball rolling and not stagnate in what we currently do. 

I think if we started to get more serious posts here about game discussion, tactics, tips, and whatnot, that would be great! I would love to discuss speedball tactics here, especially with the higher up guys/gals to see what they know, but that almost never happens here. 

We might also want to make out Announcement at the top of the content list somehow more obtrusive to posting because without fail, people ask crap all the time that can be answered in the FAQ. I see Booman posting his Beginner's Buying Guide all over the place because the new people won't read the damn thing before posting.

Again, this is not to take away things from current posts or mods!

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I think the lack of different posts has caused all of the split subs that have popper up because people are trying to get more posts coming out instead of what we have now.

Also, mods interested in sprucing up the page, /r/csshelp is where you need to go!

1335287957.0,40,self.paintball,sq88u,How I finally played paintball and what I learned the first time,40,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/sq88u/how_i_finally_played_paintball_and_what_i_learned/,"I'll try to keep this short as I know reading walls of text can be boring. (Actually it doesn't look that short now, never mind)

I've never wanted to play paintball because of the anticipation (and fear) of being shot by something whizzing by at high speed.  I think there is a natural survival instinct against standing in front of high velocity objects.

The only previous experience I had had with paintball was a bunch of us in middle school running around in the woods, all too scared to basically get hit.  That lasted 1 day. 

Recently, my friend had tried to convince me to play for the past 2 months or so but I managed to avoid ever going.   One day when visiting said friend he had his gun out and a few of us took turns shooting a tree stump.  EXTREME.

For some reason I had this urge to get shot by it, which I made known, to the horror of some and delight of others.

I threw on the mask and turned around and had my friend shoot me twice in the back.  Felt sort of like a rubber band being snapped into my skin but...1000x less painful than I thought it would be. Pain fades in about 3-5 seconds

FEAR IS NOW GONE-Only took 15 years to man-up (I'm 25 now)

Fast forward a week or two, and I finally accompany my friend and his buddy to an indoor paintball field, to which he kindly pays for my first time.  I get a badass rental gun and 200 rounds.

I feel like Rambo, the anticipation to slay and rain fire down upon myne enemies is building.

My friends get all decked out in their crazy fancy gear, meanwhile I throw on a winter hat with tassles and some fleece neck-warmers as a neck protector.  I also have a hand-towel tripple folded and hanging down in front of my man parts.


I look like a homeless man with a face-mask and a loincloth.

Badass.

We decide to do some 2v1 because there was no one else there.  The initial rush is pretty sweet, and I'm slipping and sliding and doing commando moves, firing when I can at what I can with my sweet semi-auto rental.  Meanwhile my friend's guns glow blue like high-tech alien plasma rifles and spit a steady stream of paint.

Crouching behind my first bunker while paint smashes into the backside emitting a satisfying thunk gets my adrenaline pumping, and brings back all the memories of my buddies in combat, so I just scream, ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" and pull some Tropic Thunder Shit and start running down field spraying paint.   

Anyway, I was able to use my speed to my advantage in the earlier games that were 1v2 or 2v2, but later in the day when I was joining games with more players, being exposed in the start of the game is just a death sentence.  

I got lit up quite a few times for moving up too fast too early.

I played a few Open Games and was demolished in short order, as the rate of fire of those player's markers was just insanity.  For every 5 rounds I fired downrange 50 were returned to my location.  It was fun  though, because it let me know I still had a ways to go in improving both my equipment and my skills.

TL:DR

Things I learned:

* Paintball is insanely fun &amp; a good workout
* Being shot by a paintball is 1000x less painful than you imagine it will be, and in the heat of battle you feel the pain even less
* I wore makeshift head, neck, and crotch protection-probably looked ""uncool"" but I don't care, as it gave me confidence to not worry about exposing certain parts of my body.
* I'll probably get some form of knee pads in the future or padded pants, I had bigger bruises on my knees from sliding than from paintballs
* Yell ""HIT"" loudly and slowly raise your gun/hand (I'm doing gun from now on).  A few times I raised my hand and it got shot to shit.  I was literally hit 3 times in the same skinny part of my hand while trying to notify people that I was out, and it drew blood. 
* When you do ""get out"" don't walk in front of friendly fire.  One of those shots to the hands was from me walking right in front of a friendly player and getting hit from ~15 ft away.
* Don't be afraid to give a fist bump and commend people on ""nice shots"" as that is how you make new friends.  Granted, there were people there who wouldn't even acknowledge my existence as a new player and made me feel like some sort of peasant, but the majority of people are cool.
* Don't worry about looking ""cool"" and having the most badass and expensive gear.  Being safe and having fun is more important

That's about it...I encourage anyone on the fence to JUST DO IT, or at the very least, get shot once or twice in the backyard from a good distance by a friend (wearing the proper safety equipment) as that was what made me realize it wasn't so bad.

I have played alot over the past 15 years. It started in high school playing soccer, then in college it was intermural sports and in my adult life and military life its been playing various sports here and there.

Since playing my first game of paintball a few weeks ago I have not experiance the level of comradery and friendly behaviour amonst sports players as I have in paintball.

Now this may be because im new and have not have heavy exposure to the sport, but so far between buying my stuff and playing with pickup players and having conversations I have been extremly impressed with how helpful people have been without getting frustrated or mad at me.

I had one guy willing to help as far as making a video on how to break down the gun to replace to O ring inside.

It makes me want to go out of my way to help other paintball players out.

I got my gun cheap from someone and i needed the rest of the gear. Because i was new i had some complete stranger give me pretty much everything i needed to play besides a mask. HPA tank/pod packs/pods/ hopper. And did it all for free.

After talking to him and a few others I have a idea why. I guess paintball people just want people to play with. THey want people to keep playing paintball and enjoy the sport they love.

Like golf paintball seems to be a game of honor. Calling yourself out when hit by a paintball.

While I know this is not like this everywhere it is a pleasent surprise. I know people cheat no matter what, get mad at stupid things and are just ugly nasty people. Lucky for me so far this is not this case.

I just want to thank everyone who so far has helped my first month of playing enjoyable, and the people who have helped me not get frustrated, but instead pass on their knowledge on.

This critical piece of equipment holds your paintballs, and feeds them to your marker. There are a wide variety of loaders out there, from shake'n'bake's, to Q-loaders, to 10-round tubes.

Feel free to discuss anything you wish, as long as it remains relevant. This includes, but is not limited to loaders themselves, loader types (gravity, force feed, agitated, 10rds, etc), brands, accessories (eg. speedfeeds), mods, related play styles, or unique loaders like warp feeds.

For the duration that this discussion is active, we would ask that you keep all loader related posts in this thread.

Come Look for more Details,41,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1a4e7x/help_stolen_gear_come_look_for_more_details/,"Hello people of Reddit. My teammate has gotten his car broken into in San Diego, CA, between late night of 2/13/13 to morning of 2/14/13 (Report thread on PBnation: http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?t=3936415)

Most of his gear was stolen, but one most noticeable one was his custom milled and 1 of 1 annoed DM12 (picture in the post). 

We found out that the gun was bought by this guy, TheNewEra (http://www.pbnation.com/member.php?u=603903), of SD Notorious. They play out of Total Combat Paintball in San Diego.

Here is a post of a fellow PBNer (http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?t=3948773), who found the thread of TheNewEra selling the gun, as well as picture from his facebook using the said stolen gun. TheNewEra took down the post and said that it was sold when he was made aware that the gun was stolen. Now in this other theft report that my teammate created (http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?t=3948520&amp;page=2) a user named Deadloc posted screenshots of TheNewEra asking him if he was still interested, AFTER HE SAID HE SOLD THE GUN LOCALLY!

Now the original owner of the gun went with police officers to TheNewEra's house, and TheNewEra still denied that he has it, and still claims that he sold the gun already. Even his father is backing up his case.

If anyone knows about anything, or sees the gun being sold or sees it on their field, please PM me and let me know. My PBN username is JCPerez2393. Please help my teammate recover his gun.

Also I should mention that here are the two threads that SD Notorious has up looking for players and having tryouts:

Some back story: My friends I play with are all Tippmann fans. They make fun of my ray gun-like markers and I tease them on the inordinate amount of weight they carry. However the only thing I wish my marker had was a one or two point sling. I don't want it all the time. However for large scenario events like ION where I may be standing around not doing anything for long periods of time, I do want one.

So looking for a way to put rails on the Axe, I found this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDPvizlfR6A - he had no tutorial and just said it took him an hour. So I risked the $80 to get one. Now I don't care about the milsim aspect like he did so I did not add the fake mag in the receiver or anything. 

I had to cut the opening for the feedneck bigger. Also had to shave some of the tabs and thickness off the back of the rail kit. Other than that, it fits fine. The lever to release and take off the stock even works. It takes normal Tippmann style stocks and picatinny rail accessories. 

I only use this for scenario events. Otherwise it is just 10 screws to take it off and then I use it normally. Enjoy.

To my knowledge, I am the first Korean-American to play professional paintball.  I play for the Los Angeles Ironmen in the PSP tournament circuit.  I also compete overseas in the Millennium Series with an SPL (Semi-Pro) team called Offenburg Comin at Ya from Germany.  The Ironmen is one of the oldest, most successful professional paintball team in the history of the sport.  We are the flagship team for one of the largest paintball companies in the world (Dye Precision) here in the U.S., while Comin at Ya is the flagship team for Dye Precision in Germany.  I’d be more than happy to answer any of your questions, ask me anything!

So, in the few short months that I've frequented /r/Paintball, I've seen innumerable posts made by people with little to no experience who, having done not a shred of research, make requests for help choosing ""x"" gear on ""y"" budget, where ""x"" is normally stated vaguely and without clear detail and where ""y"" is completely nonexistent.

And then, in that same thread, I see the same posts, over and over, and people becoming increasingly frustrated with having to repeat themselves time and time again. But don't get me wrong: I like helping people out and want them to get the best gear their money can buy, but it really does get annoying after the 200th ""What's the best marker I can get for $200"" post.

So, I think that we should do something about that. My suggestion would be to do something in the manner of /r/Funny's **DON'T PUT THE FREAKING PUNCHLINE IN THE FREAKING TITLE** motto that appears at the top of every new submission page. Except for ours, it would be **DO YOUR RESEARCH AND USE THE SEARCH BAR BEFORE SUBMITTING A THREAD ASKING FOR HELP**. Sticky [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/13p9b6/ridiculously_useful_guide_to_buying_gear_that/) thread, have it linked at the top of the page where it can clearly be seen.

An hour and a half in I was playing against this father/son/gf combo and had taken out the son and gf and began making my way back around the map when I saw the dad who was around 10-15ft infront of me, I gave him a shot in the back and he was upset and told me I should have asked him to surrender, which I understand and should have probably done so. But after the game he comes up to me and the ref is trying to get in between us but the guy just pushes him out of the way, the guy grabs my Mini and holds it like baseball bat and starts smashing it against this wood bunker. Luckily the only thing that broke was the reg rail and maybe the gun reg. I was pissed and when we got back to the safe zone I asked the people sitting there if they wanted to meet a man-child because this guy just broke my gun over a wood bunker over getting shot once in the back. It was the craziest thing I've ever experienced, the paintball place said that's the 2nd time in 9 years they've ever seen anything like that. Anyone else have any crazy stories of people overreacting?

Rules: 

-Must be a mechanical marker, IE: no electronics, e-grips, ect. 

-Must have a barrel at least. 

-One entry per person with two pics max. 

-Must be your marker not, here's my buddies marker because I think it looks kewl. 

-Try to limit text posts 

I'll say top five get to duke it out again in a second round. 

Keep it classy guys try to resist the urge to downvote people markers, you can upvote your own if you want. I want to try to start this up with other marker types as well if this one goes well.
